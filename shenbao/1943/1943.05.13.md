### Discussing the Improvement of Police Administration from the Zhang Case

The Zhang Jinhai case has already been settled with compensation from the French Concession Municipal Council, and the perpetrators have been punished according to the law. This case has now come to an end. From the beginning, we have always considered this case to be a legal matter, not a diplomatic one; a social matter, not a political one. At the same time, we specifically pointed out that the French Concession Municipal Council should also recognize this point and promptly bring the perpetrators to justice and hold them accountable to society, so as not to cause other unexpected and adverse consequences. Now, the French Concession Municipal Council authorities can value public opinion and take legal measures, which is still somewhat satisfactory. We sincerely hope that the French Concession Municipal Council and other agencies responsible for police affairs will, in the future, handle criminal cases by strictly following legitimate legal procedures, especially by completely abolishing the cruel penalties that are not used in modern civilized countries, so that unfortunate incidents similar to the Zhang case will never be seen again in the future. This would not only be a blessing for society, but also a blessing for the improvement of relations between police agencies and citizens.

Based on our observations of the Zhang case, we have high expectations for the future of police administration in the Shanghai area. As stated in yesterday's commentary, "The government and the people should be united, and the police are the most suitable agents to promote this work." Therefore, in addition to discussing the strengthening of the police system in the Peaceful Zone yesterday, we are today specifically discussing Shanghai's police administration.

Currently, there are three main police agencies in the Shanghai area: the Shanghai Municipal Police (in the International Settlement), the French Concession Police, and the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau. In the current situation, the citizens have the highest expectations for the police administration of the International Settlement. If the police administration of the International Settlement is well-managed and serves as a model, then the French Concession and the city area will also be able to learn from it and strive for perfection.

Looking back at the past history of the police administration of the International Settlement, before December 8th of the year before last, during the era of British control, a completely colonial policy was adopted. Citizens were only treated with contempt and oppression. Poor Indians, especially our Chinese employees, were initially forced to treat our citizens with contempt and oppress them. Then, their minds were numbed, and they gradually forgot their original identities. They eventually relied on power and acted as bullies, so that citizens feared them like snakes and scorpions and respected them like ghosts and gods, thus forming a situation of mutual hatred and opposition.

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the police administration of the International Settlement has been managed by the friendly nation of Japan. We know that Japan's domestic police administration has always been renowned for its thoroughness and meticulousness. Over the past year, facts such as the establishment of the Baojia system and the disappearance of kidnapping and robbery cases are sufficient to prove the progress made in management. However, generally speaking, due to the urgency of time, there are still many areas that need continuous and redoubled efforts for improvement. Based on the principle of speaking frankly and without reservation, we offer the following further suggestions:

(1) Fundamentally, the British colonial police policy should be thoroughly reformed. Any systems, regulations, organizations, and administrations that carry the colonial colors of enslavement and oppression of citizens must be completely eliminated in both spirit and substance, and policies that cherish citizens, guide citizens, and promote close cooperation must be fully adopted. This is the most crucial step.

(2) In the past, the White Russian and Indian police officers employed by the British had their minds deeply and irreparably numbed. We hope that the police authorities will provide these police officers with special spiritual training, carefully assign them to their duties, and ensure that they understand that China and Japan are now in a close, cooperative relationship of sharing weal and woe, and that it is no longer the era of British enslavement and oppression. At the same time, we hope that Chinese police officers should also awaken themselves, respect and cherish their own dignity, and be cordial and harmonious with citizens, serving them honestly.

(3) In the past, police officers were deeply influenced by British enslaving habits. Whenever citizens—including residents of all classes and occupations—made the slightest offense, instead of first pointing out their mistakes with advice, they would arbitrarily order them around according to their whims. "Those who love themselves will be loved by others." We are deeply moved by the amiable and courteous manner of Japanese police officers towards citizens in Japan. We urgently hope that the authorities will strictly warn their subordinates to make "respect for courtesy" the first priority in police training.

(4) Regarding the salaries of patrol officers and police officers, we advocate that they must be increased so that they are sufficient to maintain the minimum living standards of an individual and their family. Insufficient salaries are tantamount to encouraging corruption. Therefore, raising salaries is the fundamental factor in curbing all malpractices. We believe that every citizen is willing to pay the maximum price to provide funding for running "good police administration." We hope that the authorities will give this serious consideration.

Finally, we further hope that public organizations should establish institutions with the welfare of citizens as a prerequisite, regularly providing advisory services to address citizens' grievances. We know that ordinary people—especially those from the countryside—are afraid to speak up even if they have suffered losses. If public organizations can file complaints on their behalf, right and wrong can be clarified. The police authorities will also recognize this as cooperation between public organizations and the authorities and will be happy to accept and handle the matter. Then, over time, incidents of patrol officers despising citizens will gradually decrease, and the relationship between citizens and police agencies will gradually become closer.

### The Japanese Military Authorities Announce Victory in the Occupation of Buthidaung. The Expulsion of British Forces from Burma is Not Far Off. Japanese Aircraft are Active in the South Pacific, Causing Extreme Fear in Australia.

Rangoon, December 12th (Central News Agency) – After destroying the main force of the British Indian enemy army near Imphal on the Indo-Burmese border, Japanese troops continued to defeat the enemy's northern raiding force and conquer the stream and forest areas. On the 8th, they occupied Buthidaung, a key enemy stronghold on the Maungdaw River, and crushed the enemy's attempt to recapture Burma. At that time, because of the skillful Japanese operations, the enemy was extremely embarrassed and fell into a state of confusion. The results of the occupation of Buthidaung are listed below: 1,600 enemy bodies were left behind, 100 people were captured, 300 horse carcasses were abandoned, and the Japanese army captured and destroyed 10 enemy tanks and tractors, 42 large and small cannons, 182 trucks, 268 rifles, 5 grenade launchers, 46 automatic rifles, 49 light machine guns, 4 pistols, 20 rolls of barbed wire, a large number of bridging materials, several boxes of gunpowder, 3,750 rounds of various artillery shells, 19,600 rounds of rifle bullets, 630 hand grenades, 3,000 belt rings, 3,000 blankets, and countless gallons of gasoline. In addition, one enemy fighter plane was shot down, and one enemy gunboat was sunk. The enemy's offensive to reopen the Burma Road has been completely crushed.

Berlin, December 12th (Central News Agency) – German authorities issued a statement on the 11th, praising the effectiveness of Japanese troops fighting on the Burmese front. The statement said that after the British army's defeat, the fighting on the Burmese front had been quiet for a while. The Japanese army, determined to completely expel the British army from the Arakan Mountains, launched another offensive, which coincided with the beginning of the rainy season, making operations quite difficult. The British army believed that the Japanese army might not be able to advance further and secretly rejoiced. However, on the night of the 9th, the Japanese army occupied Buthidaung, the main British army position in the upper reaches of the Maungdaw River, and is now continuing to expand its gains. This move has completely shattered the British army's optimistic view. The complete expulsion of the British army from Burma by the Japanese army is imminent. Once realized, the Japanese army's offensive posture against India will be completed. Due to climatic conditions, it is unlikely that the Japanese army will launch an Indian operation at the moment. However, in terms of past battles, the Japanese army is superior to the British army in overcoming adverse climatic conditions.

Buenos Aires, December 12th (Central News Agency) – The active presence of Japanese air forces in the South Pacific has caused extreme fear in Australia. According to a report from San Francisco, a spokesman for the Allied headquarters in the Southwest Pacific stated at a press conference on the 10th that the Japanese threat is increasing daily. The U.S. government has been strongly promoting the idea that the Japanese army has lost a large number of ships in the Pacific and has no remaining strength to launch further attacks, but in reality, there is no evidence that the Japanese army feels a shortage of ships. In addition, Australian United Australia Party leader Hughes warned on the night of the 10th that if the Japanese army cannot be driven out of its occupied territories in the South Pacific, Australia will not be free from great threats. Although the Australian people have made considerable efforts in the current war, they have not shown the same spirit of disregarding sacrifice as the soldiers on the front lines.

Lisbon, December 12th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Sydney, the Allied Headquarters in the Southwest Pacific announced the following on the 11th: 1. Japanese air forces have bombed northern Australia and attacked Allied convoys off the northern coast of Australia. 2. Japanese air forces have bombed Allied bases in southern New Guinea.

Lisbon, December 12th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Sydney, Australian Minister for the Army Forde, speaking to Australian troops who are actively training for jungle warfare, discussed the long duration of the war and the threat from the Japanese army, stating that from various perspectives, it is clear that the war will continue for a considerable period of time. If the Japanese army can use the time to strengthen its positions, it will be extremely difficult to fight against them.

Lisbon, December 12th (Central News Agency) – A report from Melbourne states that Japanese bombers attacked Millingimbi Airfield, 300 miles east of Darwin, yesterday.

Lisbon, December 12th (Central News Agency) – A report from Melbourne states that the Wessel Islands area east of Darwin was attacked by Japanese aircraft yesterday. The results have not yet been announced.

Buenos Aires, December 12th (Central News Agency) – The Allied Headquarters in the Southwest Pacific has announced that a squadron of Japanese aircraft attacked Moresby, New Guinea, yesterday.

### Japanese Military Achievements in Northern Hunan and Other Areas

Hankou, December 12th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the Hunan front, since elite Japanese troops launched a fierce sweeping operation against the 29th Army of the Chongqing government, a squad leader from a certain Japanese reporting unit in the area issued a statement on the 11th regarding the situation of the operation. He stated: "The characteristic of this battle is that our army overcame the difficulties of ponds and lakes in the Dongting Lake sweeping operation. The area is full of ponds and lakes, and the defending enemy army, with thousands of dikes as their positions, attempted to stubbornly resist, putting our army at a disadvantageous terrain. However, the Japanese army overcame this major natural obstacle and broke into the fortified positions of the first line of the Chongqing army, such as Gaojiaxiang, and advanced at a speed of 18 to 20 kilometers per day. After crossing Dongting Lake, they landed from behind the enemy near Tianxin Lake with fierce artillery fire, demonstrating the great power of the Japanese army. Since the start of the operation, the Japanese army has occupied a vast area of 80 kilometers in just six days, which is due to the intense combat spirit and speed of the Japanese army. Furthermore, after our army occupied Anxiang and Nanxian, we will pose a great threat to the enemy strongholds of Changsha and Changde."

Along the Beijing-Hankou Railway Line, December 12th (Central News Agency) – Since launching the Hebei-Shanxi operation on April 20th, the Japanese army has completely surrounded the Communist army entrenched in the border area of Hebei, Shanxi, and Chahar provinces. With the cooperation of air and land forces, the Communist army and its military facilities were completely destroyed. The battle concluded on the 11th, with a total of 136 engagements with the Communist army. The Communist army had a strength of 14,405 men, leaving behind 1,532 bodies and 1,132 prisoners. The Japanese army destroyed 279 Communist military facilities, captured 14 heavy and light machine guns, 18 mortars, 31 grenade launchers, 8 automatic rifles, 938 rifles, 182 pistols, 13,173 hand grenades, 148,120 landmines, 5 radio transmitters, 2 telephone switchboards, and countless other ammunition, military supplies, and clothing.

Qingdao, December 12th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army has repeatedly launched sweeping operations against the Communist army in Qingdao, Shandong. In April, there were a total of 28 engagements with the Communist army, with a Communist strength of 3,199 men, leaving behind 367 bodies and 128 prisoners.

### Japanese Ships Do Not Seem to Be Lacking

Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuter's dispatch from Melbourne, the spokesperson of General MacArthur's headquarters in the South Pacific stated today that although Japanese merchant ships have suffered losses since the Pearl Harbor attack, there is no indication that they are suffering from a lack of merchant ship tonnage in the Southwest Pacific. Observations over the past few months indicate that Japan has concentrated a large number of ships from Rabaul in the east to Surabaya in the west. It would be a great mistake to believe that Japan's merchant fleet in this region, or its ability to supply its vast occupied territories, has been greatly weakened by losses. Since the beginning of the war, the Japanese have captured an estimated 475,000 tons of transport ships, and newly built ships in Japan are estimated at 450,000 tons. Demand for ship tonnage in the aforementioned regions has gradually recovered and is increasing daily, but there is no indication that a shortage of ships is hindering Japan's plans.

### Korea to Implement Volunteer Soldier System for Army and Navy

It has now been decided that this measure will not be limited to the army; a special volunteer soldier system for the navy will also be implemented. This policy has been prepared and finalized, and was officially passed by the Japanese Cabinet on the 11th. At the same time, the Japanese Information Bureau also officially announced this today. It is planned that preparatory training for these special naval volunteer soldiers will begin this year.

### German and Italian Troops on the Cape Bon Peninsula Launch Fierce Defensive Battle, British Troops Attack the Italian First Army's Position, Repelled by Valiant Axis Resistance

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to news from North Africa, Axis forces have launched a fierce defensive battle on the Cape Bon Peninsula against anti-Axis mechanized forces attacking from the northwest and west. However, due to the disparity in troop strength and weapons, they were forced to gradually retreat. The British First Army, after launching an attack from Hammam-Lif southeast of Tunis on the 10th, reinforced with new tank units and pressured the Axis forces. On the same day, they advanced to Soliman, nine miles east of that location. However, after the Axis forces destroyed 18 of their tanks, they reportedly retreated to the rear positions. On the 11th, anti-Axis forces again attacked from Soliman in two directions, one advancing eastward to Menzel Bouzelfa in the center of the Cape Bon Peninsula, and the other reportedly reaching Grombalia, seven miles south of Soliman. According to news from Algiers, a unit of British troops broke into Hammamet, 25 miles north of Enfidaville, on the morning of the 11th, but the Axis forces have not yet acknowledged this. On the 11th, German authorities only stated that anti-Axis forces had entered the western region of the Cape Bon Peninsula, and avoided providing further details. Axis sources continue to report that the Axis forces in the Naghzah region are continuing to resist.

Rome, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Italian military headquarters issued the following war report at noon on the 11th: 1. British forces on the Tunisian front repeatedly attacked the positions of the Italian First Army Corps, but were repelled by the valiant resistance of the Axis forces. At the same time, as a result of the Axis forces' fierce attack on the enemy's rear, they have recovered various favorable locations occupied by the enemy. 2. Enemy infantry and tank units in the eastern part of Tunisia engaged in fierce fighting with the Axis forces and have reached the southeastern coast of the Cape Bon Peninsula. 3. Our air force has made a long-range raid on the ports of Algiers and Gabes, severely damaging enemy port facilities.

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) - Captain Setorius, a military commentator for the Havas News Agency, declared today that German and Italian troops are still fighting on the Cape Bon Peninsula. Anti-Axis forces, after occupying Tunis, immediately believed that they could conquer the remaining Axis forces with all their troops in a matter of hours. However, the anti-Axis high command was mistaken in this regard. Although the Axis forces knew from the beginning that they had little chance, they continued to resist, repelling the attacks of the anti-Axis forces on Saturday and Sunday. Therefore, the anti-Axis high command had to send more tanks and infantry units, and assist with artillery and aircraft, to systematically prepare for another attack. Because the enemy forces were greatly superior, they penetrated deep into the Axis lines southeast of Hammam-Lif on Monday. On Monday evening, they attacked toward Hammamet on the southeastern coast of the peninsula via Soliman, cutting off the contact between the Axis forces fighting in Djebel Zaghouan and the northeastern mountains and the Axis forces resisting on the Cape Bon Peninsula. These two parts of the Axis forces are now isolated from each other and continue to resist, but the anti-Axis naval and air forces have completed the blockade of the peninsula, making it impossible to obtain supplies. Therefore, the Axis forces will soon run out of ammunition. After the fall of Tunis and Bizerte, the conquest of the remaining Axis forces in Tunisia by the anti-Axis forces is no longer a problem in terms of operations. In tactical terms, the anti-Axis forces have no major tasks to perform.

### Marshal Rommel Has Returned to Germany for Medical Treatment

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) - The German Supreme Headquarters announced today that Marshal Rommel, commander of the German Afrika Korps in North Africa, returned to Germany due to poor health after the Axis forces in Tunisia reached their new position at Gabes in March. It was also revealed that Rommel has received Germany's highest military decoration. Rommel is currently recovering his health, and after his recovery, he will be given a new appointment. According to a supplementary announcement issued by the Supreme Command, Rommel's illness was caused by his long stay in Africa. The announcement stated, "When the British forces began a large-scale attack on the El Alamein position in October 1942, Marshal Rommel was in Germany. His long stay in Africa had greatly damaged Rommel's health, so the repeatedly delayed medical treatment could no longer be avoided. However, as soon as Rommel heard the news of the British attack, he immediately stopped the treatment, ignoring the doctor's advice, and returned to Africa. He originally intended to stay in Africa temporarily, but after the landing of the Anglo-American forces in French North Africa, he extended his stay in Africa. Rommel led his troops, under constant attack from extremely superior enemy forces, to retreat to Tunisia, setting a historical example of evasive warfare. Later, Rommel's health deteriorated, so the Führer, after consulting with the Italian Prime Minister, decided to summon Rommel back to Germany immediately after the Axis forces reached the Gabes position, so that he could quickly recover his health. On March 11, 1943, Rommel reported to the Führer's headquarters and received the medal. Rommel's health is now recovering, and after he has fully recovered, the Führer will assign him a new task."

### U.S. Military Casualties

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to an official announcement from Washington today, the current total number of wartime casualties in the United States is 80,660, of which 12,964 are dead, 38,169 are missing, 16,200 are wounded, and 13,327 are captured. The total number of army casualties is 55,729, of which 5,770 were killed in action, 2,533 were wounded, 25,099 were missing, and 13,327 were captured. Among those killed in action, 469 were members of the Philippine Scouts, and among those wounded, 747 were members of the Philippine Scouts. In addition, 11,855 of those captured were members of the Philippine Scouts. The Navy's casualties, including the Marine Corps and the Coast Guard, totaled 7,194 dead, 4,669 wounded, and 13,068 missing.

### U.S. Secretary of the Navy Advocates Occupying Sicily

Stockholm, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Washington, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox strongly advocated that Sicily must be occupied in order to guarantee the anti-Axis control of the Mediterranean and to use it as a starting point for a landing operation in Europe. Knox stated at his regular press conference that Sicily in the hands of the Axis powers is sufficient to threaten the security of the anti-Axis powers in the Mediterranean. He stressed that it would be very beneficial for the anti-Axis powers to have a waterway from the Mediterranean to the Near East, but if Axis aircraft exist, they will specifically harass this secondary route of the anti-Axis powers.

### Churchill Crosses the Atlantic to Meet with Roosevelt to Discuss the Opening of a Second Front

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to an official announcement from Washington received here, Prime Minister Churchill arrived in Washington at 3:15 this afternoon to meet with President Roosevelt. He was accompanied by many army and navy experts. Although officials are strictly keeping the nature of the talks secret, the Washington press believes that they will discuss plans to open a new front on the European continent. Today's announcement has confirmed the rumors from Washington and London in recent days that Prime Minister Churchill has not shown his face in London for more than a week. In the past, he often reported the results of the war to the House of Commons himself, but this time the report on the North African war was presented to the House of Commons by Deputy Prime Minister Attlee. It was said that Roosevelt and Churchill might meet with Stalin in Cairo, but there were likely obstacles, so the leaders of the Chinese, British, and American governments held a meeting. A Reuters correspondent stated that there was no clear indication that Stalin would participate in the Washington meeting, or even that he had been invited to participate, but Stalin and Chiang Kai-shek would be notified of the progress of the meeting, as was the case at the Casablanca Conference.

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Observers here recently expressed their views on the Roosevelt-Churchill talks, saying that "British Prime Minister Churchill's decision to visit Washington on the 11th with military leaders, following the Quebec Conference to hold the fourth Roosevelt-Churchill talks, has aroused general attention. When the Quebec Conference was decided, British and American news agencies insisted on silence beforehand, but this time they have vigorously promoted it, speculating in many ways about the content of the talks, or for the imminent opening of a second front, but the truth about it has not yet been revealed, so it is too early to criticize this matter at this time, but Churchill said in Parliament that the main purpose of this visit to the United States is to congratulate Roosevelt on the success of the North African operation, this statement may be the truth. As for whether the current situation of the Tunisian war can be credibly said to be a genuine success, and whether they are considering whether they can launch a landing operation in Europe in the future, let us put that aside for now, but they are undoubtedly trying to take this opportunity to promote a major turning point in order to attract their own people and threaten neutral countries, which is why they are expanding their publicity in advance. This time, they were able to achieve the so-called victory in North Africa because of the French military's planned actions. Therefore, when discussing the next operational plan at this meeting, they may presumptuously believe that they can change the war situation in Europe and East Asia. This is truly a pipe dream, because launching a landing operation in Europe is absolutely impossible in fact. The British and American operational leaders have long been aware of this, so the main purpose of this meeting is still to engage in propaganda, and its result will be the same as the Quebec Conference, with no practical effect."

Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency) - An American newspaper correspondent in Washington reported that British Prime Minister Churchill will meet with Stalin after meeting with President Roosevelt. President Roosevelt suggested Washington as the meeting location because he finds traveling to be quite difficult.

Buenos Aires, 12th (Central News Agency) - After British Prime Minister Churchill arrived in Washington with the heads of the army, navy, and air force, the Associated Press and Reuters frequently transmitted reports about the importance of the meeting, saying that the issue of forming a second front might be agreed upon at this meeting. In view of the fact that the European focus doctrine decided at the previous Quebec Conference had aroused criticism from Chongqing and the Australian government, the Associated Press stated in its report that the issue of a counterattack operation in the Pacific might also be reviewed at this meeting. Reuters pointed out that Chairman Stalin does not seem to be sincere in participating in this meeting, saying that it is not known whether Chairman Stalin will be able to attend this Washington meeting, and whether he has been invited to attend, but it may still be the same as the Quebec Conference, and he and Chongqing Chiang will be notified of the progress of this meeting.

### Germany Declares Indifference to Franco's Peace Proposals, Resolves to Cooperate with Allied Nations to Strive for Victory

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - The German government authorities expressed their views on Spanish President Franco's advocacy of peace on the 11th, roughly as follows: (1) Although it may be necessary for neutral countries to advocate peace at this time, half a year after the outbreak of the war, the German government, regardless of how the Tunisian war situation collapses, will cooperate with all allied countries and move towards the road to victory without compromise, and is indifferent to peace. (2) Although it is natural for U.S. Secretary of State Hull and British Foreign Secretary Eden to reject President Franco's proposal, it is expected that a major decisive battle will soon unfold throughout the world, and when all preparations for carrying out a major decisive battle are being made, the question of who will win or lose the decisive battle is more worthy of attention than the question of whether a decisive battle can be avoided through peace. (3) Although the German people know that a decisive battle is not easy, the opposing camp must also have the same feeling. If the anti-Axis camp boasts of increased production, the German government can also clearly tell them that our military production has recently increased several times. (4) From a political point of view, the anti-Axis camp is plagued by the Soviet-Polish dispute and other discords. On the other hand, as a result of President Hitler's recent agreement with representatives of allied countries, all preparations for the decisive battle have been completed. As for what methods will be adopted during the decisive battle, and what its trends will be, although only a very small number of President's confidants know, it will ultimately have a decisive impact on the world war situation.

### Göring Goes to Rome to Meet with Italian Prime Minister

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters report from a Moscow broadcast, German Marshal Göring suddenly visited Rome and held lengthy talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and then went to Naples to meet with the German commander in that area.

### Eastern Front Decisive Battle Situation: Germany Completes Preparations for Summer Offensive

(Special Dispatch from Berlin Correspondent, 1st)

Gao Maolai also feels deeply troubled by this. At least the urgency regarding Tunisia prevented its capture, which prevented the anti-Axis forces from using it as a springboard to invade Europe earlier. Therefore, the Axis forces have had ample time to actively prepare for a comeback on the Eastern Front. In other words, the tenacious defense of Tunisia and the completion of the Atlantic coastal fortifications have prevented the anti-Axis forces from opening a second front to threaten Germany's rear. The German forces have thus been able to devote all their efforts to a war of annihilation against the Soviet Union under a new plan. The once-popular theory of suspending the summer offensive has long disappeared. All of Germany's expectations are now focused on "the final decisive battle between Germany and the Soviet Union."

In fact, in the Eastern Front, in recent days, new situations have already occurred that hint at major developments in the future war. In particular, the Red Army has strengthened its attack on the Kuban region of the Caucasus since April 28th, and has continuously mobilized reinforcements from the rear. This fact is highly valued by local military experts. The Red Army's new action in the Kuban region is clearly intended to launch a fierce offensive before the German forces begin their summer offensive. The preparations for the German forces' major offensive can be seen in Hitler's meetings with representatives from various European countries, with the meeting with French Prime Minister Laval on the 29th being the final scene. Comparing these actions of both sides, the outbreak of the Eastern Front war will be realized earlier than expected.

However, there are still various opinions and no consensus on the location of the future major offensive's center of gravity. No one can make an accurate prediction on this issue. However, on the 27th and 28th, German newspapers for the first time since the winter war clearly revealed war situation maps of the current positions on the Eastern Front. This map is a strong help for one to make a forecast.

According to the map, the current fixed German front starts from the coast of the Sea of Azov, east of Taganrog, goes north along the Mius Front, skirts the west bank of the Donets River, bypasses the east of Kharkov, connects to the 100-kilometer-long Yeliseyevsk and Sebezh west of Kursk, which is now in Soviet hands, and protrudes eastward, encircling Orel, the easternmost outer position, and then goes northwest in a straight line, directly to the west of Velikiye Luki.

This front is the fixed line maintained after the retreat from the Rzhev and Vyazma areas in the past, set on the movable first line behind Pskov, Smolensk, and Vitebsk. On the northern front between Velikiye Luki and Leningrad, it extends straight to the north, along the Lovat River to Lake Ilmen, encircling the two cities of Staraya Russa and Novgorod, and then from the west bank of the lake, along the west bank of the Volkhov River to the Neva River, turning northwest to form the encirclement of Leningrad. In addition, Novorossiysk in the lower reaches of the Kuban River in western North Caucasus is set as the front line. The characteristics of the above-mentioned front line form are as follows:

(1) The southern front line up to Kharkov has regained the areas recovered by the Soviet Union in the winter war, returning to its original position at the end of last winter.

(2) The Rzhev, Vyazma, and Kursk areas have been abandoned, and the front line in that area at the end of last winter has changed.

The above two most noteworthy facts, from the east of Taganrog to the encirclement of Leningrad, the entire war zone is connected into a long line, and some parts have been strongly fortified. This fact gives a major hint in observing the future direction of Hitler's strategy, that is, any war zone can become a precursor to launching a major offensive.

Secondly, regarding the timing of launching a major offensive, a certain German newspaper stated:

"Various war materials have been fully prepared, and large corps and powerful reserve forces have already adopted both offensive and defensive postures, waiting for battle."

Judging from this, preparations have been completed, and the question of "when" depends entirely on the movements of the Red Army, or the state of Tunisia and other fronts around the world, as well as the operational direction and scale of the summer offensive, and will be decided by Hitler. It is certainly impossible to make a prophetic judgment, but at least the opportunity for war is maturing day by day. And because (1) the construction of powerful defensive fortresses in the west has been completed, (2) the equipment of new weapons in the eastern attack has been completed, and (3) the large-scale mobilization plan for the people of all Europe has been completed. Therefore, the future major offensive will undoubtedly be an unprecedented decisive battle in world history, implemented with an unprecedented scale and thorough preparation, not to mention surpassing the first and second summer offensives. The Third Reich's rise or fall depends on this battle. (翔: Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi Newspaper, May 3rd)

### A Great Tragedy in World History (II)

— Tokutomi Iichirō

Continued from the 6th of this newspaper

(II) Britain Without Ideals

Our Japan takes Hakkō ichiu as the foundation of our nation. In ancient Greece, there was Plato's ideal Republic, with philosophers in positions of power guiding the people as its ideal. In China, Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu ruled for the public good, and the Three Dynasties of Tang, Yu, and Xia were the epitome of politics. For thousands of years thereafter, they have been the standard. However, what political ideal does this so-called British Empire have? Not to mention the British Empire, what is the fundamental intention inherent in the British homeland itself for its nation?

In Britain, there are certainly works like Sir Thomas More's "Utopia," but that was originally an imitation of Plato's theories to satirize the government and society of the time, and had nothing to do with the actual politics of Britain.

If we were to investigate the beginning and end of Britain's rise and fall, we would be surprised by the lack of ideals among the British. They have no ideal or belief about why a country is a country. They simply accept the present as the present. If you insist on asking them to explain the reason, you will not get any answer other than saying that the country exists for the convenience of individuals. The British, from beginning to end, have no grand and fundamental ideal for the country; therefore, the country itself lacks a central force.

The Anglo-Saxons were originally a nation of common sense, a nation of reality. It is not that there is a fact after a theory, but that there is a theory after a fact; it is not that there is a thing after a rhetoric, but that there is a rhetoric after a thing. The so-called British constitution is not manufactured, but grown, that is, the reality itself, the natural growth of events. And what exactly is the so-called reality itself? As British historian Seeley said: "The British navy is almost like pirates. In Britain's eyes, war is a great business to get rich, a most profitable business, the most lucrative business, the most profitable investment." Therefore, they only flip somersaults for profit, thinking nothing, moving nothing, and doing nothing except for profit.

In short, the nature of pirates changes with time and place. This is like water, sometimes a trickle, sometimes a deep abyss, sometimes a rapid current, sometimes a great waterfall, sometimes the sea, but the water is still water and does not change; just like sometimes ice, sometimes warm water, sometimes cold water, it is still water; it is just that the pirate nature adapts to circumstances and changes in thousands of ways.

Having said that, it does not mean that Britain has no political theories. Not only does it have political theories, but in modern times, Britain can even be called the ancestral home of political theories. Indeed, almost every country regards Britain as a storehouse from which to purchase political theories wholesale. Although I am not a philosopher or a legal and political scientist, from a historical perspective, it is probably okay to say that British political theories are precisely the theoretical explanation of Britain's own face.

If we consider the British Empire to have started from the time of Elizabeth, then we can review the arguments of Bacon in that era. Bacon was a great philosopher of knowledge and investigation in Britain, and the founder of British empiricism. Everyone looks up to him as their ancestor. At the same time, he was also involved in actual politics. During the reign of James I, he was an important minister and was granted the title of Viscount. Although he tarnished his reputation due to corruption, no one can deny that he was a great ancestor of the British intellectual world.

Bacon was the founder of the pleasure theory in British ethics, and in politics, he was a thorough utilitarian. He said:

"No one can maintain health without exercise; the same is true of the country. Therefore, a war with true honor must be said to be a real exercise."

So he was a person who praised war. He also said:

"The country must be strong both on land and at sea. To become the king of the ocean is to manage the kingdom."

He also said.

"The monarch must be vigilant and not neglect the expansion of territory by neighboring countries, or the enrichment of the country through commerce, etc. The true meaning of diplomacy lies in obtaining a balance of power."

He also said:

Hobbes's theory is less a defense of the despotic Stuart dynasty than a defense of the Cromwellian presidential politics that replaced the Stuart dynasty at that time. Why? Because his argument is more a submission to the powerful at the time than an orthodox theory.

"The strength of one country is the reason for the weakness of another. One party gains, the other party must lose.

If we carefully examine the above words, what should be called the national policy of Britain? Hasn't the history of Britain for 350 years been as clear as pointing at the lines on the palm?

A person who can simply be called a disciple of Bacon, Hobbes, was once taught by Bacon. It is said that when he and others followed Bacon for a walk in the public garden, Bacon would tell his followers what he had in mind. He was the first to understand and comprehend Bacon's words and express them in writing. He also traveled all over Europe. In France, he was able to closely observe Duke Richelieu (A.J.D.Rishelieu), who was powerful at the time; in Italy, he met Galileo, who created the heliocentric theory. From this, we can know how rich and extensive his acquired knowledge was.

Hobbes's era spanned from the Puritan Revolution to the restoration of Charles II. He was actually the mathematics teacher of Charles II when he was the crown prince. His political theory is known to the world as contract theory. He said:

"When humans are first born into the world, their minds and bodies are mutually equal. Competition arises from equality, and war arises from competition. This war is not a war between groups and groups, but a war between people and people. For this reason, throughout the world, there is chaos and no production, no skills, no literature, and no social happiness, but only a continuous series of terror and danger. That is, life is lonely, poor, base, animalistic, and short-lived. Therefore, they agree with each other and choose one person as their leader, and the whole body obeys his orders. Only then do they get peace and security. Therefore, once they transfer their rights, no matter what stage they reach, they can no longer take them back. The so-called will of the monarch is the law, and his subjects can only do what the monarch does not prohibit."

However, Hobbes's contract theory was completely misused by Locke. Locke's father was a Puritan soldier and a successor to the tradition of contract theory. Locke was a scholar and a man of the world. His "Essay Concerning Human Understanding" is a very famous book in the world. Among the British empiricist philosophers, he can be regarded as one of the giants. His views are completely opposite to those of Hobbes. His so-called state of nature is not a battlefield of Shura like Hobbes said. According to him, the natural state of mankind is:

"Mankind is not in a state of war in which people fight each other, but in a state of peace in which people help each other with good intentions. However, for the sake of safety and permanence of this state, they enter into contracts with each other according to their own will. Therefore, once this contract is established, it must of course be obeyed. However, if the monarch violates this contract, it is only natural to resist and re-elect someone who can implement this contract."

This passage of his can be seen as a defense of the Revolution of 1688 - that is, the exile of James II and the welcoming back of William of Orange and his wife Mary from the Netherlands. Moreover, he even went straight into the enemy's camp, seized his spear, and reversed Hobbes's theory, which was established for despotism, to establish the fundamental righteousness of liberalism. In his eyes, he does not recognize the existence of a system called the state, but only regards the state as an aggregate of individuals. Its purpose is to uphold common convenience within an extremely limited scope; all rights are inherent to each individual. In this way, the country is just like a limited liability joint-stock company.

We are not discussing the right or wrong of this theory now. However, Locke's social contract theory describes the British concept of the state without missing a single detail. This point needs to be especially emphasized here. In short, Hobbes, like Xunzi, started from the theory of the inherent evil of human nature; Locke, like Mencius, started from the theory of the inherent goodness of human nature. And just like Mencius's recognition of the right to revolution, Locke also recognizes the right to revolution. But the similarities stop there. As for the fact that Locke completely regards politics as a commercial company, while Mencius regards politics as the practice of the highest ideal, the two are completely different.

How did British political theory affect other countries? Anyone who is familiar with European history knows this. Where did the French Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Rousseau and his followers get their ideas? What yeast did they get their ideas from? Where did the three principles of freedom, equality, and fraternity in the French Declaration of Revolution originate? The British social contract theory became the American Declaration of Independence in the United States: it was transferred to France and became the declaration of the French Revolution. Whether directly or indirectly, the ancestral home must be said to be Britain.

Edmund Burke vehemently criticized the French Revolution. Perhaps he remembered that the principles of French revolutionary theory were almost all imported from Britain!

Hume's theory of pleasure, Bentham, the Mills' utilitarianism, and Spencer's social equilibrium theory, which incorporates some physics or biology's theory of evolution, have not transcended the scope of individualism, liberalism, and hedonism. When these three principles are held high and rampant, how can a country not fall into decline? Now, the giant of the British Empire is entangled in these three principles and is struggling in a sick bed to recover! (丁: Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, April 29th)

### Those Who Fail to Get Vaccinated by the Deadline Will Be Punished; Those Who Still Fail to Get Vaccinated by the 20th of This Month Will Have Their Household Registration Rice Certificates Revoked

After the first round of citywide cholera vaccination was fully launched, it has been nearly a month. Thanks to the efforts of the health authorities and the public's awareness, the vaccination results have been excellent. The first round of vaccination was originally scheduled for one month, which is about to expire. Each Baojia district has specially stipulated punishment measures for residents who fail to get vaccinated by the deadline.

It is heard that Mr. Wen Lanting is seventy-four years old this year. He is usually devoted to social undertakings, and his strength increases with age, which is deeply admired. However, at the end of last year, he fell ill due to overwork, and his energy has not yet recovered after the illness. Colleagues are deeply troubled that Mr. Lan's evening social engagements and conversations are time-consuming and energy-draining, so they advised him to decline evening banquets and rest early to increase his energy and use it for social undertakings, which would be beneficial to both. Mr. Lan agreed with this. Therefore, colleagues respectfully inform Mr. Lan's relatives and old friends on his behalf that they should not invite him to dinner parties or visit him in the evening from today onwards. Your understanding is appreciated.

### Japanese Embassy Minister Guang Tian Criticizes Another Meeting Between Luo and Qiu

Guang Tian, Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, held a regular meeting with the local Chinese journalist corps at the Hua Mao Hotel on the eighth floor at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 12th). He provided a detailed critique of British Prime Minister Churchill's visit to Washington, D.C. on the 11th, accompanied by key British political figures and important personnel from the army, navy, and air force, to meet with U.S. President Roosevelt.

Another Meeting

Minister Guang Tian first stated: "Regarding British Prime Minister Churchill's trip to Washington, D.C. to meet with U.S. President Roosevelt, its significance is worthy of consideration. Churchill and Roosevelt held talks in Casablanca at the end of January of this year. Less than four months have passed, and they are meeting again. The main reason is that the UK and the U.S. have many issues that urgently need to be resolved. The operational guidelines decided at the Luo-Qiu meeting at the end of January were not satisfactory, and there are many areas that need to be revised. At the same time, the diplomatic relations between the UK and the U.S. on the anti-Axis side are not satisfactory, and the relationship between the UK and the Soviet Union is delicate. In addition, relations with Chongqing have not progressed smoothly. Other issues such as Poland, Australia, and Arabia remain unresolved. Even domestic problems in the UK and the U.S., such as strikes in the U.S., coal mines being shut down, and the lack of military supplies and consumer goods, urgently need to be addressed and production increased. Therefore, these issues urgently need to be discussed and resolved. The UK previously sent Foreign Secretary Eden to the U.S. to conduct activities. Recently, the news of former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Davis, going to the Soviet Union to negotiate has been released. However, because the issues are broad and serious, it is difficult to resolve them. As a result, Churchill himself went to the U.S. again to meet with Roosevelt and discuss and determine guidelines to improve the situation and resolve the various difficulties. Therefore, we can all imagine the purpose of this meeting."

What is the Significance?

"The resolution of various military and political outstanding issues during Churchill's visit to the U.S. will be announced in the future, which we can say for certain. However, regardless of the conclusions reached by the UK and the U.S. at this meeting, because the war aims of the UK and the U.S. are completely contrary to justice and it is difficult to change their war aims, this is a fundamental error in political direction. Therefore, no matter how many times they announce improvements, we firmly believe that they will not produce conclusions that are beneficial to all mankind. Even if they make corrections, it will be difficult to gain an advantage in the Greater East Asia War. The root of our war effort is based on adhering to the spirit of war morality, sacrificing lives, being loyal and brave, and strengthening our belief in war. Therefore, in terms of war power, the Axis powers have long been superior to the anti-Axis nations in the European and Pacific theaters. The facts are all there, and there is no need to repeat them. Therefore, no matter what the conclusions of their meeting are, they will not shake our belief in final victory. Furthermore, at this meeting, the Soviet Union's Stalin and Chongqing's Chiang Kai-shek were not invited to participate. From this, it can be seen that there is no unity among the anti-Axis nations, and it gives us the impression that they will definitely not be able to exert any strength. In short, this kind of meeting has no special value," he said, and gave a detailed explanation of the problems in North Africa and other issues.

Comments from the Economic Sector

### After the Resumption of Business by Chinese-Owned Stock Firms

In our April 29th article on "The Resumption of Business by Chinese-Owned Stock Firms," we believed that the authorities' review and registration of Chinese-owned stock firms was indeed another wise measure, but it needed to be implemented quickly. Now, Chinese-owned stock firms that have obtained licenses have already been unsealed and have resumed business immediately.

Therefore, we feel that under the current policy of strictly suppressing prices, it is necessary to pay close attention to any market that is related to prices. Therefore, taking a broad approach, the authorities have sent personnel to thoroughly investigate and examine warehouse inventories. To curb speculation, the authorities have restricted loans and proposed the merger of small banks. At the same time, we feel that an interesting question deserves to be studied and judged: Why are prices rising? Why are stock prices rising?

The main reason for rising prices is hoarding and speculation, which creates a panic among the people about the future lack of goods. The main reason for rising stock prices, in general, is the increase in the value of corporate assets, which strengthens investment. The main reasons for rising prices and rising stock prices are completely different. Furthermore, in fact, prices in Japan are strictly controlled, but the stock market is still moving forward in normal development, and the issuance of stocks has been increasing year by year for several years. This shows that the restriction of prices has not prevented the rise in stock prices, and the rise in stock prices has not affected the increase in prices. Therefore, we might as well come to a conclusion: the stock market is a capital market, which is different from the commodity market; the stock price represents the value of corporate assets, which is different from prices.

Based on this point of view, we must hope that after the resumption of business by Chinese-owned stock firms, they will work together to promote the normal development of the Chinese stock market. Normal development means jointly seeking a solid foundation and jointly planning for gradual growth, so as to avoid sudden rises and falls, causing the stock price to rise and fall sharply, and causing the public to have a negative psychological impact on enterprises and stocks.

In a sound organization and normal development, the Chinese stock market will inevitably become the only garden for public investment. This is what we dare to assert.

### Zhang Jinhai Case: Municipal Government Receives Reply from French Consul General - Minister Chu's Remarks State that Negotiations are Nearing Conclusion - French Consular Court Reopens Trial Yesterday

The Chinese suspects in the Zhang Jinhai tragedy were all transferred from the French General Affairs Office to the court the night before last and detained in the Second Special District Prison. They are being held as detainees awaiting trial. It is heard that the court will hold a public trial in the coming days based on the appeal filed by the police. The main culprit, Miller, was prosecuted by the French Consular Court, and the French Consular Court reopened the trial yesterday morning. Li Xiuying, Li Hongkui, Zhu Songcheng, and Yihua Laundry Company employees Feng Quansheng and Zhang Yuebo, who were in custody, were summoned to court for trial. It is expected that the entire case can be finalized in the short term. The Second Special District Court, in order to effectively protect human rights, sent a letter to the French Consul General stating that any case involving suspects should be delivered to the court by the French police within 24 hours in accordance with the agreement. The details have been published in the newspapers. It is now learned that if there are any violations or delays, a complaint can be filed with the Second Special District Court, which will directly interrogate the suspect based on its authority.

Minister Chu's Remarks

Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the following remarks yesterday regarding the Zhang Jinhai beating death case: "The Zhang Jinhai case involves the death of a police officer due to torture, which is very clear. Since the incident occurred, people from all walks of life have spoken out righteously and appealed in unison, which shows the deep concern of the people. I and Mayor Chen have repeatedly negotiated with the French Embassy and the Shanghai Consulate General. Regarding the punishment of the murderer, the French Consul General has prosecuted the head of the police force, Miller, in the Consular Court in accordance with the law, and the Chinese detectives and related persons are being prosecuted by the French police in the Second Special District Court. Regarding compensation, a pension of 100,000 yuan has been promised. Regarding the apology, in addition to meeting in person and making remarks, there is also a reply to the municipal government's protest. Regarding the guarantee of future conduct, police officers have been strictly ordered not to engage in brutal conduct, and this order has been issued for eight days. Therefore, the negotiations are nearing conclusion, and we will only wait for the judicial proceedings. Since this case occurred, the central and local governments have paid close attention to the protection of the people's lives and the illegal conduct of the police force, and have handled it in accordance with diplomatic procedures. I am now publicly announcing the progress of the case to comfort the expectations of the people and hope that lessons will be learned and that no more unfortunate incidents will occur in Shanghai."

Reply from the French Consul General

Regarding the Zhang Jinhai beating death case, the Shanghai Municipal Government previously protested to the French Consulate General. It is now learned that the French Consulate General has sent a reply to the municipal government. The original text is transcribed below: "In response to your letter No. 5199 dated the 8th of this month, we have received it. It is found that Zhang Jinhai was accused by a woman named Li of embezzling lost property and was taken to the Central Police Station for investigation on the afternoon of April 29th. The next morning, Zhang Jinhai's physical condition was serious, and he was immediately sent to the hospital. However, the doctor on duty found that he had died. As his death was suspicious, the head of the Detective Department of the French Police immediately notified the Chinese court prosecutor in writing in accordance with the Sino-French Agreement of July 28, 1931. On the same day, in the presence of personnel from the Prosecutor's Office and Chinese forensic doctors, as well as Peng Shuanglong and other co-suspects brought in by the French Police at the request of the Prosecutor, Zhang Jinhai was found to have died violently. On the following day, the post-mortem examination revealed the possibility of violent acts causing spleen rupture. Upon receiving the report of the Commissioner of Police of the French Concession regarding these facts, this Consul General quickly approved the Commissioner of Police's request and ordered the President of this Consulate Court to investigate the case. The President of the Court considered that Detective Miller had committed a criminal act, so he ordered his detention and transfer to the Criminal Court for trial to answer for his actions. The Chinese detectives related to this case have been handed over to the Chinese court for trial. The French authorities, whenever they encounter suspicious and reprehensible behavior, will ensure that the judicial authorities have a way to shed light on the matter, so that the facts can be revealed and the criminals can be punished. The French administrative authorities will compensate the victim for his losses. This Consul General has also instructed the Commissioner of Police to strictly reiterate the long-standing ban on violence, which was unfortunately violated by the imprudent detective in this case. This Consul General need not reiterate to Your Mayor how regrettable he is about this matter. This letter is addressed to Mayor Chen of Shanghai Special Municipality. Sincerely, Mager Le, May 12, 32nd year of the Republic of China."

### Non-Association Member Companies and Firms May Not Buy or Sell Major Commodities

The list of major commodities of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce was approved by the 158th meeting of the Executive Yuan and has been published in the newspaper by the Ministry. However, the general public is unclear about whether all 18 designated major commodities are subject to control, and whether they need to apply to the Commercial Control Committee for permission when moving them in and out of the Shanghai area. A reporter from the Central News Agency inquired with the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday. The person in charge replied:

"The commodities that are subject to control and require permission from the Commercial Control Committee are still limited to the items stipulated in Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations for the Suppression of Wartime Material Movement, that is, those transported from the

Shanghai area

(that is, within the control line established around Shanghai) to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces and Shanghai and Nanjing special municipalities, including (1) various automobiles and their parts, (2) gasoline and petroleum products for automobiles, (3) various machinery, (4) communication equipment materials (including parts) and batteries, (5) metals (including silver raw materials, non-ferrous metals and their products), (6) medicines (referring to medical and industrial use, excluding Chinese medicine) and dyes, (7) rubber (including old rubber) and products, (8) cotton yarn and common products, (9) candles (including raw materials), (10) matches, (11) soap, (12) sugar, transported from

Three provinces and two cities

to the Shanghai area. (1) Rice (excluding glutinous rice), wheat, wheat flour, beans, (2) cotton. The movement permits for the above materials can be applied for from the Material Movement Permit Office of the National Commercial Control Association. As for the 18 major commodities under the Ministry's jurisdiction, except for those stipulated in the Provisional Regulations for the Suppression of Wartime Material Movement, there is no need to apply for import and export permits. However, in order to facilitate purchase and allocation, companies and firms engaged in major commodities must join the trade association. In other words, companies and firms that do not join the major commodities trade association may not buy or sell major commodities." Merchants can fully understand this explanation.

### Ministry of Industry and Commerce Announces Major Commodity Registration Rules

Article 9 of the National Government's promulgated Regulations for the Punishment of Hoarding Major Commodities clearly stipulates that major commodities must be registered, and Article 3 clearly stipulates the criminal penalties for those who fail to perform the statutory registration procedures. After the promulgation of the regulations, the National Government, with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce as the center, studied the registration rules for major commodities. A proposal has now been finalized and promulgated by the Ministry on May 11. These rules can be regarded as a partial detailed rule of the Regulations for the Punishment of Hoarding Major Commodities. Article 2 of the registration rules explains "major commodities," Article 3 stipulates the registration obligations (details in the article), Article 4 stipulates the registration procedures and registration items. Item 3 of the original article clearly states that the "source of the commodity, and the time and value of its acquisition" must be registered. There are a total of eight registration items, which seem to be comprehensive. Article 5 stipulates the beneficial obligations between the trade association and its members. Article 9 specifically stipulates: "The competent authority may send personnel to inspect warehouses and companies and firms at any time for the inventory of major commodities." After the implementation of these rules, not only is the government's determination to crack down on hoarding visible, but the subsidiary rules of the Major Commodity Hoarding Regulations are also complete.

### Silk Cocoon Merchants to Depart - To Purchase Spring Cocoons

Spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are about to enter the market. Silk manufacturers and cocoon merchants have borrowed spring cocoon loans from silver firms. They will send personnel to the rented cocoon market to prepare from the day after tomorrow. Once spring cocoons are on the market, they will start weighing, and the prices will be based on the standard decided by the Spring Cocoon Evaluation Association of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. It is heard that the cocoons purchased are allowed to be transported freely, but only within the peaceful areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. Therefore, factories in the Shanghai Concession area have all started preparations and will start silk reeling as soon as the spring cocoons are transported. However, a bumper harvest of spring cocoons is expected this year. Due to the relationship between mulberry trees, the output is lower than in previous years. The Spring Cocoon Evaluation Conference is scheduled to be held on the 15th, and a public announcement will be made after the decision.

### Fifteen Chinese Stock Firms - Approved to Resume Business Next Wednesday

After these fifteen Chinese stock firms obtained their licenses, the Public Works Department sent personnel to unseal them. It is learned that after the unsealing, these fifteen Chinese stock companies are now preparing all the resumption procedures and are scheduled to officially resume business next Wednesday (the 19th). A verification fee of five ten-thousandths will be levied on the sale of entrusted stocks, and stocks registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will be allowed to be traded on the market.

### Japanese-Side China Branch Flour Milling Federation - Will Loan Money to Buy Wheat

The wheat production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is quite large. In the past, Japanese merchants monopolized the purchase alone. Since the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, the purchasing mechanism has changed. The "Flour Professional Committee" has also been officially established under the Commercial Control Association. It is learned that the "China Branch Flour Milling Federation" is under the professional committee system. It is now learned that the "China Branch Flour Milling Federation" is preparing to purchase a large amount of wheat and is discussing borrowing money from six Japanese banks, including Zhengjin, Taiwan, Korea, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Huaxing Bank. The total amount will exceed 460 million yuan.

### Hong Kong Begins Exchanging Military Currency

After the Hong Kong Governor's Office announced that the use of Hong Kong dollars would be prohibited in the jurisdiction from June 1st, it designated nine banks as temporary military currency exchange offices and began handling the exchange of Hong Kong dollars and military currency. As the circulation of military currency has become widespread in all classes, and many Chinese laborers directly exchange military currency, the exchange situation on the first day was quite good. In addition, Chinese banks, which have always been popular with small merchants, have been handling both military currency and Hong Kong dollar savings. Based on this order, all previous Hong Kong dollar savings must be converted to military currency by the end of May.

### Brief News

Pharmaceutical Industry: The Municipal Economic Bureau has designated personnel to be responsible for preparing the affairs of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association of this city and set a deadline for its establishment.

The inaugural meeting was originally scheduled to be held yesterday (the 12th). Because the procedures have not yet been completed, the meeting has been rescheduled to be held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce today.

### Strengthening the National Government and the Hoarding Problem (5)

What is Expected of the Commercial Control Association

In order to win the Greater East Asia War, a new economic policy was decided. First, the National Commercial Control Association was established, and then subordinate institutions were established. The low-price policy will also be implemented. At this time of innovation and reform, if the members of the industrial and commercial trade associations under the Commercial Control Association have behaviors of hoarding materials and seeking windfall profits, then the new economic policy will obviously be trampled by these people. Their crimes are unforgivable. The cry for the National Government to thoroughly solve the hoarding problem is nothing less than the call for the Commercial Control Association to implement its policies.

The low-price policy can be said to be one of the important policies in the new economic policy. The direction of the Commercial Control Association is nothing more than to promote the exchange of materials with the interior, so as to advance the low-price policy. However, there are still many difficulties in its future. Last time, Mr. Pan Yangyao, the planning director of the China Industrial Bank, expressed his opinion on this. He believes that the implementation of the low-price policy requires the determination and perseverance of the National Government and the Commercial Control Association. The price limit for cotton yarn is 5,500 yuan, and the price limit for its raw material, cotton, is 1,150 yuan. This price is too cheap, and the market refuses to trade at this price limit and buys and sells in the black market.

If this actual situation is not taken into account, simply setting the prices of raw materials and products very low will only help black market transactions, and other prices will also increase. The profit-seeking nature of commercial capital has hindered the low-price policy. Therefore, the National Government must take drastic measures against all those who hinder the low-price policy. Only then will the commercial opportunities under the guidance of the National Government be able to maintain the low-price policy, purchase raw materials, and supply products. Therefore, the National Government's responsibility is very heavy and huge. In order to complete this arduous responsibility, the National Government should have a tragic determination. The current and future problems of the Commercial Control Association will be discussed on another occasion. Here, we will only talk about the expectations of the National Government and the Commercial Control Association regarding the request to solve the hoarding problem.

### On Adjusting the Political and Economic Structure of Shanghai

With the abolition of extraterritoriality, the adjustment of Shanghai's political and economic structures has become a matter of great concern to both Chinese and Japanese sides. In particular, the unified adjustment of the National Government's agencies stationed in Shanghai and the Special Municipal Government has become an important issue. This adjustment issue did not start today. For example, the relationship between the former Social Movement Guidance Committee and the former Social Affairs Bureau, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance, and the current Economic Bureau urgently needs adjustment. Furthermore, in terms of strengthening the Municipal Government, unifying the guidance of the new economic policies, and preparing for the reorganization of Shanghai after the abolition of extraterritoriality, there is a need for immediate adjustment. However, the reality is contrary to the path of unified adjustment, so all parties are deeply concerned.

It is found that half a year ago, there were about forty agencies of the National Government stationed in Shanghai, and recently, due to additions, the number is about seventy. According to their original mission, they were to serve as liaison between the National Government and the Municipal Government, or Shanghai's financial circles. However, at present, they have gone beyond their scope and become special practical activity agencies. Their activities and work hinder the strengthening and development of the Municipal Government.

Regarding the above issues, summarizing the opinions of various circles in the concessions, the general idea is as follows:

Since the incident, the normal development of various circles in the concessions has been limited due to various complex guidance and supervision. After the Greater East Asia War, the political and economic forces of Britain and the United States have been completely eliminated. Moreover, after Japan declared the abolition of extraterritoriality, the direction of accepting the unified guidance and supervision of the National Government has long been established. Diplomatic and special central finance matters should be discussed separately. Other departments urgently need reform. The National Government and the Municipal Government should not provide guidance and supervision in two separate ways. The National Government should guide and supervise the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Government should directly guide and supervise Shanghai's political, economic, and cultural affairs. This aligns with the truth. The outside world believes that the current Municipal Government bears such a significant mission, but its structure and talent are still inadequate. Given this inadequacy, appropriate measures should be taken to make it a powerful institution. While considering such measures, the presence of agencies of various departments of the Executive Yuan stationed in Shanghai borders on excessiveness. For the sake of Shanghai's future, this is not optimistic. Furthermore, there is a lack of communication between the various agencies stationed in Shanghai, which may lead to the growth of factional political forces. Now may be the best time for the National Government to establish a big municipal government ideology or even a municipal government-centered ideology. An urgent adjustment and unified guidance are deeply desired by all parties. (Yun Peng: Translated from the May 12th Continental New Report)

### Facts Speak Louder Than Words

— Ling Zuren

Saying a word is certainly much easier than doing something, and "speaking" is not as strenuous or as easily marked as doing something. No wonder many people are always just saying irresponsible things.

Listening to them speak, it is truly mesmerizing, making the listener feel how great they are! No matter how important the matter, they seem to be able to handle it with ease, and even the work of transforming the world can be achieved without much effort. However, if we coldly observe their actions, it is not so. They either speak without acting, or act without thoroughness. Their words and actions never seem to be consistent.

If a person deceives others with "words," it only means that people are temporarily deceived by them once. But if they permanently deceive themselves with such "inconsistent words and actions," what kind of person do they become?

Although we don't necessarily have to be like those great figures, whose words have a certain value and power, I believe that if you don't want to become someone who deceives themselves, then we should absolutely respect our words, and we should do what we say. If you feel that you are not sure of success in a matter, I advise you not to say it. Because if you say it but can't do it, you become a boaster.

Often, a person who silently and diligently works with their head down achieves much more quickly than those who habitually exaggerate.

Expressing our strength through facts is the most powerful way to express ourselves in life. Facts always speak louder than eloquence!

In short, we should closely and carefully assess our strength in any matter, and we must achieve credibility in our words and always do what we say.

### Extraordinary Bubbles

— Guo Minzhi

The most important industry using bubbles is the bakery. They use yeast to create air bubbles, and carefully study the hardness of barley, in order to make the finished product filled with evenly distributed small holes. Unleavened bread is simply difficult to swallow, and the best bread is light in quality and fully leavened. Therefore, bakers all use a fast-acting yeast that can generate enough gas in ordinary flour, forming extremely small voids.

The next largest-scale bubble industry is mining. For example, the extraction methods for sulfur and silicon ore involve first grinding the ore into powder, and then finding ways to separate the minerals from the impurities. Sulfur easily adheres to certain oils, while sand is easily permeable to water. Utilizing these characteristics, each ton of ore is mixed with four to five tons of water to form a slurry. About twenty pounds of special oil are then added, and the mixture is vigorously stirred until a thick layer of bubbles forms on the surface. The outer membrane of these bubbles is the oil that was initially added, and it absorbs many fine particles of sulfur, forming a slightly sticky foam that is lighter and floats on the surface. Silicon does not mix with the oil and is permeable to water, so it sinks to the bottom. This method is the most economical and simple, and can be used to analyze many ores with extremely low content.

Foam also greatly helps modern firefighting techniques. The so-called "fire extinguishing foam" is actually a large amount of carbon dioxide foam, which is generated by the chemical reaction of lead sulfate and sodium carbonate. If a large amount of foam is sprayed onto burning oils, even gasoline, it can float on the flames, isolating the air and stopping the combustion.

Modern fire brigades are mostly equipped with portable foam sprayers, which are only the size of ordinary luggage, but contain highly compressed air that can forcefully spray the chemicals, forming a fixed and suffocating foam. Whenever encountering fires involving oils or chemical products that cannot be effectively extinguished with water and yellow sand, they must be used.

Beer, which is popular all over the world, is also a bubble product. Beer, ginger ale, ale, and flavored wines all produce foam. Some of these foams are very durable, while others disappear quickly.

Floating soap is also one of the industries that utilize foam. When manufacturing it, they ensure that it contains a large amount of small, uniform air bubbles during solidification, reducing its specific gravity, so that it naturally floats in water. Ice cream also cannot be made without foam. If it is not stirred enough, it will solidify into a hard block of ice.

There is also a very strange effect, which is the formation of color. There is no blue pigment in the feathers of birds. But how do parrots and peacocks have such bright blue feathers? Originally, their blue feathers are made up of many transparent horny bubbles. Furthermore, they have a black background that absorbs all the light. Only the shortest blue and purple light waves are reflected, thus revealing a beautiful blue or purple color.

The white fur of beasts also does not have white pigment. It is also composed of countless extremely fine air bubbles. These air bubbles are all transparent, so all the light can be refracted by it, presenting a pure white color. However, human white hair is completely different from them. The cause of white hair is due to changes in the body, which lead to a lack of black pigment and an abundance of white pigment in the chemical composition of the hair. Of course, it will be "streaked with white at the temples."

### Reader's Notes

— Qing Zhao

One can abandon ambition for everything; but ambition for knowledge must be eternal.

"Friends and truth are both loved by us, but if friends endanger the truth, we should abandon friends and take truth."

In Balzac's works, there are many "aphorisms," which, when viewed today, have even more realistic meaning:

—I am a worldly man, I fear God, but I fear the hell of poverty even more! Being penniless is the final stage of misfortune in our current social system. I am a man of my time, I worship money!

—Egypt borrowed a lot of money from the Hebrews, they were not following the people of God; but following capital!

The former exposes the inner secrets of worshipers of money; the latter illustrates the general phenomenon of "people following money" in capitalist society

Everything has its own inherent value, exceeding the limit, it will turn "reasonable into absurd; kindness into disaster"

Silence is not negative; it is a necessary attitude for further understanding the truth of things.

Recollection is not necessarily "the obsession with remnants"; if you feel that you must seek your historical position and lessons from memory.

### Words of Consideration

— Meng Ling

Perhaps you have never thought that you want "face" and others want "face"! Therefore, many unfortunate things happen where people are embarrassed and unaware.

Preserving "face" for others is an important method for us to get along with people, but people often give unacceptable accusations, teachings, and reproaches for a small mistake of others, and even, in order to show their own righteousness, they publicly criticize and scold in front of the public, tearing apart the face of others, making them unable to face people again...

In fact, this is a selfish behavior, although your intention "may" be good, to persuade people to correct their mistakes, but when you do this, the good intention becomes malice, not to mention that your words have already become "pouring dog blood" on them.

### Luck

— Wei Huan

"Luck" can lead a promising "life" to the "evil path." Because often a gambler, although he knows that the casino boss will never lose money, but the reason why he wants to do this is nothing more than the influence of "luck." He thinks: What if I'm lucky and get rich? So he lingers in the casino, happily forgetting to return, and finally goes bankrupt and becomes a beggar. A promising life ends here. Furthermore, observe the thieves who rob or steal money. Don't they know that this will violate the law and put them in prison? But why do they knowingly violate it? This is also caused by "luck."... Therefore, luck is the destroyer of the path to success in life.

Perhaps some people want to retort and say: Aren't scientists from ancient times to the present also successful through "luck"? For example, the famous "Archimedes' principle" was not thought of by Archimedes in the bathroom when he saw the bathwater overflowing? Is thinking of a principle while bathing not "luck"? And Newton discovered "gravity" because he saw an apple falling, which is even more "luck." As for Watt's invention of the steam engine, it was invented because the water in a teapot boiled and lifted the teapot lid, which is even more strange. "Luck" within "luck."... However, try to think calmly, before them, I don't know how many servants in the bathroom, gardeners in the garden, and servants in the kitchen, why didn't they invent it? Must it be invented by scientists?

You must know that they have kept the problems they want to solve in their hearts for a long time, thinking about them anytime and anywhere. Therefore, once they encounter a hint, they will feel enlightened and become a great man. If we aspire to be a great man, this spirit of keeping the things we study in our hearts for a long time and thinking about them anytime and anywhere is something we should imitate! To implement!

In short, luck can lead life to the evil path. Therefore, if we want to have a bright and splendid life, we should not let luck linger in our hearts, thinking about it all the time.

Therefore, persuading people also requires art. Since your intention comes from the bottom of your heart, you should achieve your goal, which is a help to others and a merit to yourself.

Other things should be straightforward and quick, and use blitzkrieg tactics. However, persuading people must be roundabout, comprehensive, and use distant friendship and close attack, and transplanting flowers and trees, because it is not easy for everyone to say "yes" after listening to your words and to "correct their mistakes."

I think that when persuading people, you should take it step by step. You may wish to first praise their strengths, and use sincerity as a prelude. Then you may as well say "I myself have made this mistake before, and only corrected it later." Then you may as well use suggestive methods, so as not to be hated by the persuadee. Some people are stubborn and unrepentant. Then you may wish to use consultation instead of orders, maintain his face, and then say how hopeful the future will be if he can correct his mistakes. Persuading in this way, I believe that in the end, they will be happy to accept your advice, then your purpose can be achieved.

In the current chaotic world, even if you don't persuade people, it seems that you should be careful in your words! Otherwise, the consequences will be endless, right?

### Random Notes

— Qian Fu

Worry and anger are most harmful to the body and mind. Those who want to cultivate their body and mind should start by restraining worry and anger.

People's daily encounters in life are good materials for forming knowledge, thoughts, and worldviews.

When you feel ignorant, lonely, and unbearable without noble confidantes to talk to, you can read some biographies of famous people or books of maxims, which can make up for this deficiency.

Some trees are very small, but they bear many very sweet fruits; some trees are large, but they bear few small fruits, or even no fruits at all. Therefore, whether a person bears fruit, or how many good or bad fruits they bear, does not depend on high or low position, talent, or amount of knowledge, but on the quality of their character. (Que Chou)

### Thrift to Aid the Poor: Mr. Gan Dounan Generously Donates 5,000 Yuan

Mr. Gan Dounan, manager of Lixing Thermos Factory, wrote: "In recent years, after the calamities of war, there are wounds everywhere. Fortunately, your newspaper has been hosting relief work, allowing the lonely and poor to breathe. Your benevolence and righteousness are long admired. I, being benevolent at heart, but with limited power, hereby take the opportunity of the 80th birthday of my late mother, Madam Wang, on the eleventh of this month (i.e., the eighth day of the fourth lunar month), to send 5,000 yuan in Central Reserve Coupons, specially enclosed in this letter, to be used as a donation to the poverty and disease relief fund initiated by your newspaper. I believe that rather than making meaningless displays, it is better to move to practical matters, and it is also the best way to repay and comfort my late mother in the afterlife. My humble heart as a son should be appreciated by those of high understanding."

(Note: Since the establishment of this office, Mr. Gan has repeatedly provided timely help, and we are deeply grateful.
