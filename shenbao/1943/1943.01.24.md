### On the Issue of Talent

In Chinese politics, the issue of employing people is often more important than legislation. "Having laws but not having the right people to govern" has resulted in exceptionally serious and adverse phenomena, which are extremely common both in ancient and modern times. Therefore, we have elaborated in detail on the point of "appointing the virtuous and enabling the capable," urging the authorities to pay attention to the issue of talent and strive for proper solutions. However, there are often situations where, when the government undertakes a task, it wants to "appoint the virtuous and enable the capable," but feels that there are few virtuous and capable people, and wonders where such people are to be found. Either there is a feeling of a lack of talent, or that there is not enough talent to deploy. As a result, either many undertakings that should be done are shelved because virtuous and capable people cannot be found, or many undertakings fail to achieve the desired results because of having to employ unqualified personal favorites or second-rate talent, often leading to adverse consequences. At the same time, regarding talent scattered throughout the country, there is either a feeling of "talent not being recognized" or the suffering of "not using what one has learned." The phenomena of "graduation equals unemployment" and "learning not being applied, and applying what one has not learned" has been a serious problem in society for more than a decade. The former is a problem of talent cultivation, and the latter is a problem of talent employment and allocation.

Regarding talent, everyone emptily says that there is a "lack of talent." However, if you try to ask: What is the actual situation of various talents in China? What are the most needed types of talent at present? I am afraid that not everyone can give a correct and reliable answer. If relying only on personnel statistics from various government agencies, or only on statistics of the number of graduates from schools at all levels over the years, it is naturally not enough. However, for the sake of all undertakings in the current new era requiring appropriate talent and a large amount of talent, and needing to mobilize all manpower, if we do not understand the distribution of various talents, and if we do not understand the employment and allocation of various talents, we will never be able to achieve the rationalization of employment and allocation of various talents, and we will have no way to mobilize the nation's manpower. At the same time, if we do not know the actual situation of the lack of various talents, we will have no way to determine wartime and peacetime education policies.

Therefore, first, we can learn from the talent registration methods of various advanced modern civilized countries. This method was first initiated by Italy, and later Germany followed suit and implemented it, with larger organizations and scales than Italy. Japan also has talent registration facilities. In this World War, the talent registration of the Axis powers certainly contributed greatly to the war effort. Generally speaking, a "National Wartime Special Scientific and Vocational Skills Talent List" can be compiled by a specific national agency, or an organization such as the National General Mobilization Committee. With such a list, if a certain type of talent is needed for national defense purposes, it can be found simply by checking the list. Or, a specialized agency could be established, such as a "National Scientific and Expert Talent Registration Bureau," jointly organized by representatives of relevant government agencies and representatives of academic organizations, and prominent Chinese and Japanese experts could be hired to form an advisory committee, including departments of natural sciences, applied sciences, and social sciences, to provide technical advice and design various talent survey forms. The work can be carried out in departments. First, register the talents most needed for national defense at present. For example, physicists, chemists, geographers, geologists, various engineers, etc., all those whose current talent statistics are incomplete should be registered first. The talent survey form can include the name, address, age, gender, marital status, military service, government service, health, education, etc. of the person being surveyed. In addition, necessary questions can be listed, such as questions about the person's formal and informal occupations, knowledge of specialized scientific equipment, writings, inventions, special research work, and in what field they believe they can best serve the country. This is general. In addition, specialized surveys can be conducted. If the government authorities need a certain type of special talent, they can ask the registration agency to find suitable candidates, and then the government agencies can directly contact them, adopting methods of invitation and persuasion, rather than forced conscription. This kind of work will certainly be of great help to the country's talent pool.

Second, further utilize the work of talent investigation and registration as a basis for government agencies and academic organizations to cultivate cadres and train talent. Because, based on investigation and statistics, knowing what kind of talent the country lacks most at present, the degree of lack, and the reasons, we can base the national specialized talent education plan on the current degree of need, and we can make reforms in the education plans of schools at all levels, training courses, etc. As for the employment and allocation of talent, it can be based on talent investigation and recruitment to achieve rationalization. However, it should be clear that talent investigation and registration itself is not the goal; the goal is the effective use of talent. To achieve this, the government authorities must have a spirit of impartiality and selflessness, be able to break down all boundaries and prejudices, and have the determination to "start anew with the people," truly achieving the step of "measuring talent and assigning it to appropriate positions" and "appointing the virtuous and enabling the capable." At the same time, it is also necessary to eliminate relatives, old friends, and incompetent individuals from government agencies and departments at all levels with the spirit of "putting righteousness above family." For example, the Chongqing regime actually opposes talentism and only loves to appoint personal favorites and sycophants. In Chiang Kai-shek's mind, anyone with the surname Chiang, Song, or Kong, or who is from Zhejiang, or is a student who has studied in the United Kingdom or the United States, regardless of gender, age, relatives, or old friends, is talent. Therefore, friction and exclusion inevitably occur in the agencies at all levels of the Chongqing regime, and political corruption and popular resentment are inevitable. We hope that the government will go a step further and achieve "respecting talent." Because truly talented people can never be lured by wealth and status, it is necessary to respect their aspirations, pay attention to persuasion, and never have the slightest compulsion. We believe that as long as the arrangements are appropriate and the politics are enlightened, who would not be willing to serve the country? However, the most important condition for truly attracting talent from all walks of life is the people's spontaneous enthusiasm for the country. Before starting, it is necessary to carry out extensive public opinion publicity to make people from all walks of life understand the government's true intentions and respond automatically. During the preparation period, it is also necessary to gather ideas from all sources and humbly accept opinions from all sectors of society. Therefore, it is first and foremost up to the government to fully demonstrate that it is an enlightened and good government that is for the country and for the people. Only then will the virtuous and capable people of the world be willing to come and be afraid of being late. Otherwise, truly talented people will leave in disappointment, and all talent investigations and registrations will not achieve real results. As for those who are still dreaming the dream of "I am the only one worthy" in this new era, regard the people as fools, and reject the people from afar, then there is no way to talk about talent at all. In view of the Chongqing regime's failure to cherish talent and failure to employ talent, it is necessary to appeal to the authorities to pay attention.

### The Army Training Regiment Opens, Chairman Wang Delivers Training Speech

Nanjing, 23rd, Central News Agency Telegram: Yesterday (the 23rd) morning, the opening ceremony of the Training Regiment of the General Training Supervision Office of the Army was held, with the Chairman personally delivering a training speech. The general meaning of the original speech is as follows:

First, it is explained that leading troops as a unit commander and working in military agencies are both serving the country and have the same value. Officers should not have the idea that this is their own unit and that is not their own unit. The military should also not have the idea that this is their own superior and that is not their own superior. It must be known that the military belongs to the country and the officers serve the country. Only in this way can we be qualified to talk about building the army.

Second, it is explained that the reason why the country organizes and adjusts the army is entirely to rationalize and systematize the country's army. The military needs talents in all aspects. The government treats talents equally and has no favoritism. After the training regiment receives training, it will either be assigned to serve in the troops, or be assigned to work in military agencies, or be transferred back from the troops to military agencies, or be transferred from military agencies to the troops. All should obey the government's orders to transfer work. We must break the old concept of warlords' private generals and private soldiers in the past, in order to assume the new mission of the new era.

Finally, it was said that the responsibility of soldiers is very important now, and there are many things to do. In terms of participating in the war, what is our strength? In terms of loving the country, is our concept of patriotism clear? In terms of loving the people, how can we avoid disturbing the people? In terms of ourselves, what are everyone's skills and knowledge? These all need to be reviewed one by one, and more efforts must be made. Participating in the war is China's expression of its position and determination to defend East Asia. To defend East Asia, we must revive China. To love the country, we must love the people. To love the people, we must cultivate ourselves. Striving to cultivate ourselves and become a sound soldier is a prerequisite for shouldering the mission of reviving China and defending East Asia.

### Unprecedented Fierce Battles Occurred on the Stalingrad Front, Soviet Forces Launched Offensives Everywhere, Losing Enormous Numbers of Troops and Equipment

Berlin, 23rd, Haitong News Agency Telegram: A Haitong News Agency reporter learned from responsible sources last night that after repeated Soviet attacks on the left and right flanks of the German positions on the Stalingrad front failed, they recently gathered a large number of infantry and tanks and launched fierce attacks along the entire front. Since the day before yesterday, extremely fierce battles have occurred. Berlin learned yesterday that the number of infantry, artillery, tanks, and rocket launchers gathered by the Soviet army west of Stalingrad was quite large. The German army gave it strong resistance, causing it heavy casualties. The Soviet army had to retreat. The Soviet army broke through a German position in one place. The German army fought fiercely with it before moving to a new position, destroying 644 enemy tanks. The final result of this battle is still unknown.

Berlin, 23rd, Haitong News Agency Telegram: According to military spokesmen here, the largest battle in this war is now taking place on the southern route of the Eastern Front. There is fierce fighting everywhere on the front from Voronezh to the Caucasus. The Soviet offensive south of Lake Ladoga on Sunday was repulsed. The Soviet offensives in the central part of the Eastern Front and southeast of Lake Ilmen have weakened. The weather conditions on the entire front have not changed, but the temperature in the Stalingrad area has dropped slightly.

Berlin, 23rd, Central News Agency Telegram: The German authorities recently provided detailed explanations on the general war situation on the Eastern Front in the past two days, and admitted that the Soviet offensive was extremely fierce, and they still expressed their confidence in victory, with firm calculations on future progress. The current focus of the battle is the Donets industrial area between Voroshilovgrad and the Caucasus. The German authorities admitted that this operation was the largest battle since the beginning of the Eastern Front in terms of troops and territory. The German army calmly launched operations in the area, launching fierce attacks on the Soviet army, which did not hesitate to expend its forces. The Soviet army adopted the method of avoiding combat. The German army successfully coped with the Soviet army's breakthrough operations on the front line. Since January 13, the Soviet army has launched fierce attacks in order to break through the German positions in Leningrad. According to German calculations, the Soviet army has lost 6,200 tanks since the beginning of the winter offensive until the 20th, which has greatly affected the Soviet army's resistance. The German authorities made the following statement on the future war situation: The winter operations launched on the Donets Caucasus route are unprecedented battles in terms of the number of troops, weapons, and the vastness of the territory. The two armies are now successively engaged in heroic and deadly battles. The German army continues to retreat based on an elastic operation plan in response to the Soviet army's attack on the Eastern Caucasus. The German isolated army in the city inflicted great damage on the Soviet attacking troops. In order to recover the Volga River front, the Soviet army is desperately trying to capture the city of Stalingrad. However, the Soviet army's operational goal is only to completely annihilate the German army, and it has not clearly stated the area to be occupied, which proves that the Soviet army is also well aware of the limits of its combat power. The question now is how much troops the German and Soviet armies have lost, and whether the German army can launch a summer offensive with powerful units. The Soviet army has already lost a huge amount of weapons and troops. On the contrary, the German army has extremely avoided the sacrifice of troops and materials. Therefore, the difference in combat power between the two armies is extremely large. Moreover, the overall situation of the war has not yet been determined. The German army is still waiting for the opportunity to prepare for the future summer offensive. At that time, it will be the time of the decisive battle, and the victory of the heroic bandit will forever shine on the heads of the German army.

### Soviet Forces Attack Rostov

Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd, Central News Agency Telegram: Judging from the war situation in the past two weeks, the Soviet army's operational goals have been roughly clarified, that is, its greatest goal is still to attempt to recover Rostov. The Soviet army's strategy is to go south along the railway line between Voronezh and Rostov, passing through Millerovo, Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, and Novocherkassk, in order to attack Rostov directly. The Soviet army's troops and equipment in that area are still very good. The Soviet authorities recently reappointed General F.I. Golikov, commander of the Southern Front Army, to directly command the operations in that area. As for the Soviet army under General Konstantin Rokossovsky, it has arrived at the fork of the Don and Donets rivers, and is again trying to advance westward, wanting to meet up with the Soviet army going south in Manfeto. Another Soviet army under General Andrey Yeryomenko has gone south along the railway from Stalingrad to Krasnodar, crossed the Manych Canal in Proletarsk, and arrived in Salsk on the 22nd of this month. It seems that the army intends to switch its attack from that place and attack northwest along the railway leading to Rostov. Also, the Soviet army under Lieutenant General Golikov south of Voronezh is also aiming to attack westward, seemingly wanting to make a large-scale southward attack on Kharkov, reach the Sea of Azov, and then try to form a siege of Rostov. However, the German army's defensive operations are quite flexible. For locations that are not strategically important, it will never make a stubborn defense without adjustment, or make an active offensive, or make a decisive retreat, all of which can be done in an orderly manner. Always taking Rostov as the center, it will put all its efforts into fiercely attacking the Soviet army.

### Rumors of U.S. Troops Attempting to Occupy Saudi Arabian Oil Fields; British and American Ships to the Country Decrease; Economic and Trade Conditions Worsen

Rome, 13th (Havas News Agency) – According to the "Il Popolo d'Italia," U.S. troops arriving at Basra in Iraq have moved towards Saudi Arabia in order to occupy the oil fields there.

Rome, 23rd (Havas News Agency) – "Il Popolo d'Italia" reports that the Saudi Arabian government recently requested that Britain and the United States fulfill their agreements with Saudi Arabia, as Britain and the United States had guaranteed to maintain Saudi Arabia's foreign trade. However, due to threats to British and American ships in the Indian Ocean, the number of ships sailing to Saudi Arabia has decreased, resulting in a deterioration of Saudi Arabia's economic situation. Saudi Arabia relies heavily on rice from India for food, but now there are very few ships traveling between India and Saudi Arabia. At the same time, Saudi Arabia previously received significant income from pilgrims visiting Mecca and Medina, but now, due to the war, pilgrimages have ceased.

U.S. Diplomatic Activities in the Near East

In his telegram, the German Foreign Minister stated that the Tripartite Pact is the foundation for close cooperation between the Axis powers, and this agreement will greatly contribute to achieving economic goals in both peace and war for the Axis powers.

### Appointment of Peyrouton Creates a Major Crisis; British Prime Minister Churchill, if in the U.S., Must Be There to Resolve This Political Issue; American Newspapers Criticize Hull Regarding the North African Situation

Bern, Switzerland, 22nd (Havas News Agency) – London news. British circles are deeply indignant at the appointment of Peyrouton as Governor-General of Algeria and, in effect, as Administrative Commissioner of French Africa. London newspapers are actively condemning the United States for making this decision. This move not only complicates the position of the Allied Powers in North Africa, but also "creates a major crisis between Algeria and Morocco." The U.S. State Department made this decision without consulting the British authorities, and Peyrouton himself openly stated that he has relations with the United States, so immediately after arriving in North Africa by plane, he visited U.S. General Eisenhower, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. forces. In addition, Peyrouton announced his plan to "purge" the North African administration and attempted to reach an understanding between General Giraud and the de Gaulle faction. Furthermore, there are also disagreements in Syria and Lebanon. British military authorities and the de Gaulle faction have expressed strong opposition to the appointment of former ambassador Helleu as High Commissioner to Syria and Lebanon. They immediately requested the British government to reverse the decision, but it is said that this matter has not yet been resolved.

Lisbon, 23rd (Stefani News Agency) – "Novidades" emphasizes that if Churchill is indeed in Washington, his purpose must be to resolve the political problems of French North Africa. Regarding the appointment of Peyrouton, the newspaper comments that, based on Peyrouton's past political record, it will undoubtedly provoke protests from many quarters in France. We do not understand why they did not choose someone else to fill this position, perhaps because those who can win popular support are unwilling to cooperate with Britain and France.

Lisbon, 22nd (Havas News Agency) – Washington news. This Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Hull made a statement regarding the North African situation, stating that military matters are paramount and political issues are unimportant. American newspapers have criticized this in their articles. The New York Journal of Commerce stated that the Secretary of State cannot evade responsibility with one sentence, because all Americans have the right to ask how the North African situation is progressing.

### U.S. Congressmen Criticize Industrial Recovery Policy; Price Administrator Issues Final Report, Saying U.S. Economy Faces a Serious Crisis

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to news from New York, Republican and Democratic congressmen in the U.S. Congress are increasingly opposed to the government. For example, Senator Byrd, a leader of the opposition to the New Deal industrial recovery policy, gave a speech in Massachusetts on the 19th, severely attacking Roosevelt's New Deal industrial recovery policy, stating that Roosevelt's New Deal industrial recovery policy over the past decade has failed, and all the money of the American people has been completely wasted. Today, the U.S. government's national debt has reached $103,928,824,797, and it is expected to increase to $300 billion by the end of the war, averaging about $2,500 per person. Therefore, he demanded that the government dissolve all organizations based on the New Deal industrial recovery policy in order to reduce the burden on the people.

Buenos Aires, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to news from Washington, U.S. Price Administrator Henderson submitted his resignation on the 22nd and gave his final report to Congress, strongly stating that the U.S. economy is now facing a serious crisis and urging the authorities to seek countermeasures. He stated that, given the current state of the U.S. economy, a more effective economic stabilization policy should be implemented in 1943 than before. The various agencies for stabilizing the economy have been largely prepared, and now it depends on how we utilize their functions. What should be implemented in the future is to increase taxes, and at the same time, expand the savings allocation system. For this reason, we intend to ask the people to endure sacrifices and practice diligently, because only in this way can we remove the threat of inflation.

### Philippine Islands Commemorate the Anniversary of the Establishment of the Administrative Organs; Japanese Commander Tanaka Attends and Delivers an Address

Manila, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The 23rd is the first anniversary of the establishment of the Central Administrative Organs in the Philippines. Celebrations were held enthusiastically throughout the Philippine Islands. Here, the public held a grand public assembly in Luneta Park at 11:00 a.m. The Japanese Supreme Commander Tanaka, along with various staff members, and Administrative Chief Vargas attended, making the atmosphere very lively.

Manila, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Supreme Commander Tanaka attended the public assembly commemorating the first anniversary of the establishment of the Philippine administrative organs on the 23rd and delivered an address, stating that it has been a year since the establishment of the Philippine administrative organs. Looking back, Chief Vargas and others resolutely cooperated with us last year. At that time, the flames of war had not yet subsided. They set about preparing the organization, cooperating to promote military administration, leading the people, overcoming all difficulties, and making great efforts to stabilize people's livelihoods and welfare, thus achieving today's results. Their hard work is truly admirable. Friendly cooperation between Japan and the Philippines is a natural trend. The reason why they could not sincerely cooperate with each other before was due to the interference of Britain and the United States. Today, the evil forces of Britain and the United States have been driven out, the preparation of central and local administrative organs has been completed, and the foundations have been laid for the new Philippine people's organizations since the dissolution of several political parties such as the Philippine Nationalist Party. We are infinitely inspired to see the solid foundation of Philippine politics on this commemorative day. We hope that you will understand the internal and external trends at this time, understand the true intentions of Japan, abide by the established policies, and strive to complete the great mission.

### Xu Daquan's Fratricide Case Still Sentenced to Death

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The case of Xu Daquan, the young owner of the Shanghai Huamei Pharmacy, killing his brother Xu Songyao, in which his father Xu Xianglai used his wealth to collude with police detectives to swap the bodies in an attempt to deceive the inspection, and then bribed officials in hopes of reducing the sentence, resulted in the dismissal of several judges from the Shanghai Second Special District Court. The trial was transferred to the Capital District Court, but has not yet concluded. As for the case of Xu Daquan's fratricide, the first instance only sentenced him to ten years in prison. However, the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court changed the sentence to death in the second instance. Xu Daquan refused to accept this and appealed to the Supreme Court, which remanded the case for retrial due to procedural irregularities. After a new trial in the second instance, the death sentence was upheld. Xu Daquan again refused to accept this and appealed. Now, the Supreme Court announced its verdict on the 23rd of this month: Xu Daquan's fratricide case involved eight cuts, five of which were fatal, which was indeed cruel. The first instance's sentence of only ten years in prison was a mistake. The original sentence of death in the second instance should be upheld.

### Germany Adopts Elastic Warfare to Suppress the Soviet Counteroffensive; Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, January 15

(Special Correspondent Taguchi of the Asahi Shimbun, Zurich, 12th) In mid-December, the Soviet army launched a more heroic counteroffensive from the middle reaches of the Don River, aimed at attacking Millerovo and Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, with Rostov-on-Don as the ultimate target. After the counteroffensive in the middle reaches of the Don River, they soon began to advance from the south of Stalingrad along the Stalingrad-Krasnodar railway towards Kotelnikovo. Another force launched a counteroffensive from the Grozny region against Millerovo, blocking the German forces in Kamensk-Shakhtinsky. After the Southern Army recaptured Kotelnikovo, they launched attacks along the Don and Sal Rivers. It is reported that fierce battles are currently taking place 120 kilometers from Rostov-on-Don. At the same time, the Red Army advancing from the Grozny region has reached Mozdok and Nalchik. Overall, the Red Army's new offensive in the southern theater aims to recapture the entire Caucasus and the Terek basin. The Soviet Union's current main goal is clearly to recapture Rostov-on-Don.

According to recent German intelligence, the Red Army's weapons are now almost entirely domestically produced. A newspaper in a neutral country commented on the nature of the Red Army's winter counteroffensive as follows:

The vanguard of the attacking forces are all sturdy factory workers. After the start of the war, they were engaged in production in factories in the rear while being trained as reserves. However, the elite troops are only a small number of the vanguard, and the subsequent reinforcements have not received sufficient training, being newly recruited soldiers from last autumn. Most of the junior officers are members of the Communist Youth League, which is equivalent to the Hitler Youth in Germany. In fact, the Soviet army relies on this to maintain the morale of the Red Army.

Another German newspaper commented:

"The quality of the Red Army infantry is lower than before, but the weapons they use have been strengthened, such as tanks and aircraft, which are fully armored and quite powerful."

Military experts from neutral countries, based on the above criticisms, draw the following conclusions about the nature of the Red Army's winter counteroffensive:

The quality of the Red Army soldiers cannot maintain a higher level due to insufficient training, but there are still considerable military supplies and sharp junior officers. This is the characteristic of their second annual winter counteroffensive. The young officers seem to have gradually understood strategy, but cannot thoroughly understand it. This is the biggest weakness of the Red Army. The Red Army itself is aware of this shortcoming, so it has issued a large number of slogans such as "Must thoroughly understand strategy."

Although the Soviet Union is now making every effort to recapture the south, the German army is responding with elastic defense warfare, in other words, shortening the defense line with the least amount of human and material sacrifice, while using a skirmish line strategy to slow down the Red Army's advance. Recently, due to the German army shortening its front lines and making strategic transfers, the Red Army has launched fierce attacks in northern Caucasus.

Skirmish line positions vary in size and are isolated in shape, but each has ample food and ammunition reserves. This type of position achieved much success last winter. The skirmish line strategy can be used for both offense and defense, and each position has a very large airfield, which is sufficient to deal with the Soviet offensive, while saving a lot of manpower and resources. However, because these positions have ammunition depots, they have become targets for Soviet attacks.

These positions have now become the front-line bases for continuous contact between the German and Soviet armies, so their importance is self-evident.

### From Macau, January 10: Must Britain Abandon India? (5)

— Edgar Snow

This India dispatch from Bombay, published in the Saturday Evening Post on September 12 by Edgar Snow, is more specific in content and broader in materials. It is translated for reference.

—Translator—

When considering the possibility of restoring the Indian National Congress and uniting Britain in the war, we must remember that there are still "complex matters and practical difficulties" if British forces suddenly withdraw from India. Among them, the important ones are the lack of understanding between the National Congress and the Muslim League, and the future status of the Indian princes.

The fact is that if a cooperative understanding is reached between the Muslim League and the National Congress, independence will certainly be obtained immediately. Although the Muslim League is the most powerful of the Muslim political groups, it represents only 6% of the total electorate, and even this 6% occupies only a small part of the entire population. However, Jinnah, the chairman of the Muslim League, is an extremely clever politician. He clearly understands how much his support is worth to the British and to the National Congress, and therefore makes stubborn deals.

When Jinnah and I met, he said: "If the British agree to all the demands of the National Congress, the Muslims will undoubtedly launch a rebellion throughout India." Sir Stafford Cripps had essentially allowed Jinnah to establish an independent Muslim state under British protection. This most angered Gandhi, who called it "sinful" and felt that it destroyed all opportunities to achieve unity before establishing Indian independence.

The outbreak of the August incidents was mostly spontaneous. People will never doubt the British government's ability to suppress openly destructive, worthless, and unarmed demonstrations led by mobs and students. The pertinent question should be: After the disobedience movement is forced underground, can the Axis sympathizers here organize an effective fifth column? Can such an ending be compared with the experience in Burma?

Unless we ridiculously deceive ourselves, we must recognize the urgent need to immediately make every effort to open up all possible powers and responsibilities to the Indians, except only those Indians who can definitively prove to be irreconcilable with the Allied war effort. This is the only way we can leave a place in this corner of the world, where we not only lack overwhelming power, but also do not have such power. And when I say "definitive proof," it has nothing to do with becoming stale rhetoric. This rhetoric seems reasonable, and even some still seems reasonable, but in the eyes of Asians, the British and we deny the Indians' understandable desire to take responsibility for their country, and in the autumn of India's existential crisis, we cannot rescue it—even if we can, we have hostile people behind us.

I have seen enough facts to be convinced that we cannot both oppose the Indians and the Japanese and tightly grasp India. This is the most fundamental lesson of imperial setbacks, and history is trying to knock this lesson into our heads throughout South Asia.

We can still reach an agreement with the Indians, the majority of whom support the Allies, but at present, the price of this cooperation cannot be less than a penny. All imperial privileges in India must finally be abolished, and this is as obvious as it can be, and we claim to be fighting against imperial privileges everywhere in the world.

### Wholesale Prices Now Subject to Control; Based on Yesterday's Prices; Deadline for Submitting Cost Calculations

The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office announced that the council has issued Public Notice No. 6241, stating that from the 24th of this month, all goods sold by manufacturers and wholesalers in the Public and International Settlements will be subject to the council's control. Without the council's approval, it is not allowed to arbitrarily increase the prices quoted on January 23rd. Furthermore, all manufacturers and wholesalers should submit the selling prices of their goods on January 23rd, along with cost calculations, to the council's Commodity Control Office (either individually or through trade associations) before February 10th. Those who fail to comply with the notice will be subject to disciplinary action by the council. It is understood that the French Concession will also take similar measures.

New Measures by the Control Department

Since the Materials Control Department became an independent institution on January 1st of this year, separating from the General Office, its internal organization has been greatly expanded. The number of working staff has increased from the initial twelve to over one hundred. The current system is divided into four sections: Cost Accounting and Investigation, Price Limit Enforcement, Materials Supply, and Trade Associations. The Cost Accounting and Investigation Section specializes in evaluating standard research, while the Price Limit Enforcement Section sends personnel to various stores daily to investigate business and pricing conditions, and will punish those who violate price limits, etc. The Materials Supply Section is responsible for coordinating the supply of food and other goods. The Trade Associations Section specializes in liaising with various trade associations in the city to provide appropriate guidance and assistance on evaluation and allocation matters. Now it is controlling the selling prices of various goods, which is sufficient to show the importance of the department's position in the price control mechanism.

Daily Necessities Are Not Lacking

Previously, the Yantai Market on Boone Road was found to have black market transactions, which led to repeated surges in the prices of various daily necessities, causing great harm to people's livelihood. In view of this, the concession authorities ordered the cessation of trading in the market. It was only recently that the market was allowed to resume trading, but only merchants engaged in legitimate trading and the operation of daily necessities are allowed to participate in the market. In order to comply with the authorities' wishes, the association announced the handling of trade registration a month ago, and the procedures are very strict. However, recently, the selling prices of various daily necessities have once again risen to a peak. It is learned that the authorities have decided to temporarily postpone the resumption of trading in the market to prevent speculative merchants from participating.

Hoarded Goods Are Released at High Prices

The Great China News Agency reporter, in order to understand the recent supply situation of various daily necessities, visited merchants who were familiar with the industry yesterday. They were told that currently, various retail items are allocated regularly by the authorities, and the amount allocated each time is sufficient for the stores' retail sales. There is no need to purchase additional supplies from other sources at high prices. Moreover, these allocated goods all have fixed price limits, and sellers can obtain legitimate profits. It is said that the recent surge in the price of daily necessities is due to rumors and speculation. If non-merchants, who are not engaged in this industry, use their abundant funds to entrust people in the industry to purchase large quantities of spot goods, trying to reduce the supply of spot goods, they will release their goods at high prices, hoping to obtain illegitimate profits. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this. Finally, they pointed out that there is no shortage of various daily necessities in the city, such as soap, matches, candles, etc., because various factories are currently increasing production. The supply situation of daily necessities in the city has returned to normal.

It is reported that after Ambassador Shigemitsu returns to the capital, Mr. Kodama will also follow suit to visit the capital for further discussions with relevant officials of the Japanese Embassy. In addition, Kodama will also pay a visit to General Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China, and Ishida, the supreme economic advisor to the National Government. Finally, he will have an audience with Chairman Wang, it is said.

The topic is "Entering the War and National Diplomacy." Mr. Wu is a pillar of our nation's diplomatic circles, and he recently organized the National Foreign Relations Promotion Association, hoping to use national diplomacy to assist government diplomacy. Tonight, he will speak on the topic of entering the war and national diplomacy. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention to the broadcast at that time.

### Japanese Embassy Office Held First Consular Conference Yesterday; Minister Tajiri Elaborated on Basic Policy Toward China

The Japanese Embassy Office here, in order to adapt to the new Sino-Japanese relationship after the Republic of China's entry into the war, convened its first consular conference of affiliated consuls on the 23rd at 10:00 AM at the Shanghai Embassy Office on Jiangwan Road in this city. The conference lasted one day. On the office side, Minister Tajiri and other department heads and related officials attended. From various locations, Consul General Yano of Shanghai, as well as representatives from the Nanjing Consulate General, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Wuhu, Bengbu, and other local agencies in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, arrived. First, Minister Tajiri delivered a speech, elaborating on the basic policy toward China after the Republic of China's entry into the war. Subsequently, the two investigators, Dajia and Daben, and various department heads successively provided detailed explanations on various relevant matters such as politics, economics, and culture. Finally, each consul reported on the situation in their respective areas. The atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM. After returning to their posts within the day, the consuls will vigorously pursue the path of Sino-Japanese cooperation in accordance with the instructions of the authorities.

### Excellent Japanese Factories Will Be Entirely Moved to Our Country

The complete relocation of Japanese spinning mills to our country has been planned. This time, the textile industry of Tokyo and Yokohama is preparing for its third reorganization, namely a Sino-Japanese joint venture. The 705,964 spindles of Chinese spinning mills and the existing 2,421,368 spindles under Sino-Japanese joint ventures will be consolidated, estimated to reach 1,000,000 spindles. From now on, in terms of production, it will be sufficient for self-sufficiency and even have surplus. Once this matter is realized, Chinese factory owners will need to adjust their organizational structure in terms of management.

### Scholarship Elementary School Group Exam to Be Held This Afternoon

Fifth-grade students in the fourth session of the Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Elementary School Group will take the qualifying exam at 1:30 PM this afternoon, and sixth-grade students will take the exam at 3:30 PM this afternoon at the YMCA Middle School on Sichuan Road. Rain or shine, do not be late. The examination affairs will be handled by Ms. Xu Xuehai and Mr. Ding Guangxun of the YMCA. Examinees should bring pencils and necessary supplies, and present the registration certificate issued by this newspaper for verification, take their seats according to the assigned number, and refrain from making noise or violating the examination rules. Parents accompanying their children to the exam should also maintain order.

Middle School Group Exam Scheduled for the 27th

Registration for the middle school group closed yesterday. From morning until dusk yesterday, what we were most unwilling to witness was the line of students submitting their applications, which was almost as crowded as buying oil or sugar. These people are seeking spiritual food and requesting scholarships, and their earnest situation is particularly moving, giving one the feeling of wanting to build a vast mansion to shelter the poor scholars. We earnestly hope that all sectors will continue to donate so that poor students will not ultimately be forced to drop out of school. This is not only the good fortune of our colleagues. The date for the middle school group qualifying exam has been set for the 27th, with the junior high group in the morning and the senior high group in the afternoon. The location is the YMCA Middle School on Sichuan Road.

Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday

The scholarship funds received yesterday totaled: Zhu Jixu (in memory of his late father's memorial money) 200 yuan, Huang Xiaosong, Tang Kui, Wu Ji, Xu Muxun 100 yuan each, anonymous (receipt number 2196) 40 yuan, Ying Chungao 12 yuan, Ren Jihao, Huang Darren, Fang Jincai, Du Chongdu, Chen Chongzheng 10 yuan each, totaling 702 yuan in savings certificates. Previous balance was 140,753.85 yuan, resulting in a final balance of 141,455.85 yuan.

### To Reduce Bicycle Theft Cases, Implement Personal Licensing Method; License Number and Hard Seal to Be Added to Bicycle Frame; To Be Implemented Simultaneously in the Municipal and Concession Areas Starting Next Month

A senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department stated that the Police Department has drafted a plan to eliminate bicycle theft cases within the Concession and a new licensing system, which will soon be approved by the French Concession and Municipal authorities, and will be implemented starting from the 15th of next month. The number of bicycle theft cases in the past few months has broken all previous records, with as many as ten cases per day in the International Settlement.

100,000 Bicycles in Shanghai

There are currently 100,000 bicycles in Shanghai. Therefore, the Police Department will implement a new plan to eliminate bicycle thieves and protect the interests of bicycle owners. The implementation of the new licensing system is due to the many shortcomings of the current system. Anyone can obtain a license by simply filling out an application form. Sometimes, the owner often sends a servant to obtain the license, which is also a source of abuse. Therefore, it is easy for bicycle thieves to obtain a license and cancel the original license. Under the new system, licenses cannot be easily changed, and when a bicycle owner applies for a license, they must present the bicycle for inspection. When applying for a license, the bicycle owner must fill in their name, address, and citizen ID number on the application form, and the bicycle model and number must also be noted. Before the license is issued, the Police Department will first put a hard seal on the bicycle frame, which will be the number of the license to be issued. This system will be implemented simultaneously in the French Concession and the Municipal area.

Sale Requires a Permit

Also, if a bicycle owner intends to sell the bicycle, they must first notify the Police Department to obtain a permit. Even changing the address must be reported. Then thieves will have no way to apply their skills. If the hard-sealed number on the bicycle frame is different from the license number, the person holding the bicycle will be taken to the Police Department for questioning. New measures are also planned for rental bicycles, with the front of the bicycle body painted red and the rear painted black for identification. The licensing method is the same as for privately owned bicycles.

### Noodle Industry Representatives Request Authorities to Approve Review

Mr. Sheng Xuanhuai, co-director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, met with representatives of the noodle industry association yesterday. Mr. Sheng inquired in detail about the methods proposed by the representatives and concluded that they were well-founded. He has given them complete acceptance and said that he would submit them for review at the meeting. The methods requested by the industry are roughly as follows: (1) Change 6% of household flour to a noodle ration, allowing residents to purchase noodles from noodle shops with the ration. This would allow the authorities to allocate flour according to the amount of noodles obtained by each noodle shop per period, and also prevent the industry from engaging in black market activities with flour. (2) If residents do not want to exchange their noodle ration for noodles, they still have the right to exchange it for flour, so as to avoid losses for residents.

### United Association of Silver and Money Industries Notice Regarding Warehouse Receipt Loan Method; Warehouse Receipt Must Be Transferred Prior if Not Under Borrower's Name; Endorsement Should Always Record Date for Easy Reference

The United Association of Silver and Money Industries yesterday issued a notice to its members, stating: "Respectfully, we received a letter from the Banking Association on the 11th of this month, stating that at a regular meeting of the Warehouse Group of our Association's Practical Research Committee, a representative proposed that recently, borrowers have been using warehouse receipts under the names of others endorsed by the original owner, without first transferring the warehouse receipts to their own name before seeking a loan from the bank. Instead, they directly transfer the warehouse receipts to the name of the lending bank. When the loan matures and the warehouse receipts are returned, the lending bank generally endorses the warehouse receipt with a note stating that it is returned to the borrower or their designee, and then returns the warehouse receipt to the borrower for acceptance. The borrower or their designee then uses the warehouse receipt to pick up the goods from the warehouse.

Is the Borrower the Owner of the Warehouse Receipt?

According to Article 618 of the Civil Code, 'The ownership of goods listed on a warehouse receipt shall not be transferred unless the owner of the goods endorses the warehouse receipt and the warehouse operator signs the warehouse receipt.' From the warehouse's perspective, it is not obligated to recognize the borrower as the owner of the goods. Moreover, since the borrower has not left a seal, it is impossible to verify the authenticity. Therefore, the warehouse can still release the goods based solely on the bank's endorsement, and is legally not liable in any way. However, since the endorsement specifies a particular person to pick up the goods, and the warehouse does not examine it carefully, from a moral standpoint, it still does not feel justified. If the borrower requests the warehouse to transfer the warehouse receipt to another person, the borrower themselves cannot be considered a legitimate transferee, which makes the handling even more difficult. In this situation, whether the borrower should be allowed to pick up the goods or transfer them again requires further guarantee to achieve perfection. In addition, for fundamental improvement, if someone uses a warehouse receipt that has not been formally transferred to obtain a loan, should the borrower be required to complete the formal transfer procedures before the loan is accepted, to avoid various disputes? This is one question for consideration.

Deputy Manager's Endorsement Date is Essential

Also, when a lending bank returns a warehouse receipt to the borrower upon the loan's maturity, the endorsement by the deputy manager on the warehouse receipt often does not include the date, and the borrower does not immediately pick up the goods. In recent times, there have been frequent personnel changes at the bank. Often, when the borrower comes to the warehouse to pick up the goods, the deputy manager who endorsed the warehouse receipt has already left the bank. It is impossible to ascertain when the endorsement was made. From the warehouse's perspective, it is unknown whether the endorsement written by the deputy manager was made before or after their departure. If the goods are released without knowing this, is there a liability issue? This is the second question for consideration. Several resolution methods were discussed and are included below.

Resolution Methods and Their Rationale Regarding the First Question: (A) As a fundamental solution, the lending bank should instruct the borrower to first transfer the warehouse receipt to the borrower's own name, and then transfer it from the borrower's name to the lending bank, in order to comply with legal regulations and prevent abuse. (B) As a temporary solution, when the lending bank returns the warehouse receipt to the borrower upon the loan's repayment, it should only make a blank endorsement on the warehouse receipt, and not specify the wording 'returned to so-and-so'. From the bank's perspective, the loan has been repaid, and the collateral receipt has also been recovered, so there is no liability. There is no need to make a registered endorsement, which would reduce the warehouse's liability and provide many conveniences. Regarding the Second Question: When the borrower uses the redeemed warehouse receipt to pick up the goods, if the deputy manager who made the endorsement has left the bank, and the date is not indicated on the endorsement, the person picking up the goods should be required to provide a valid endorsement at the time of pickup, and then the goods will be released. At the same time, the industry should be requested to ensure that the date is always recorded when the deputy manager endorses the warehouse receipt upon the borrower's redemption of the loan, for future reference. The above two proposals were both passed, and the association was instructed to record them. The above issues are very important in terms of warehouse receipt practice, so we have sent this letter to you for your information and implementation." Upon approval, the matter was submitted for discussion at the meeting yesterday and it was resolved that, if the warehouse receipt loan is not under the borrower's own name, the lending bank should instruct the borrower to first transfer the warehouse receipt to the borrower's own name, and then transfer it from the borrower's name to the lending bank, which is the proper procedure. It is recommended that the industry implement this consistently to ensure legality and prevent abuse, which is what the association calls a fundamental solution. Regarding the second question, when the borrower redeems the warehouse receipt from the lending bank, the bank officer must endorse it. To prove the effective period, a date must be recorded in the endorsement in the future for easy reference. We have recorded these matters accordingly and are issuing this notice separately. We hope that you will take note and implement it."

Yesterday's newspaper was released at 7:05 PM

### Shen Bao Monthly Resumes Publication; Second Issue Call for Papers; China's Economy After Entering the War

The resumption issue of the Shen Bao Monthly was originally scheduled to be published on the 16th of this month, but the registration procedures could not be completed as scheduled, so it was delayed until yesterday.

We hope that readers will not hesitate to give us your guidance and contribute your valuable articles to enrich the content.

### The Law of Preserving Wealth (3)

— Nie Yuntai

Mr. Nie Yuntai, the author of this article, is old and virtuous, and enjoys doing good. In recent years, he has studied Buddhism diligently, and his compassion has increased even more. He wears simple clothes and eats plain food, and his self-sufficiency is minimal, but he donates all of his surplus, embracing the principle of taking from society and using it for society. He is able to accumulate and disperse, and actively does good. It is said that Mr. Nie's family has prospered for seven generations, which is enough to see that the blessings of accumulated virtue are not accidental. Even if he does not accumulate money for his descendants, his descendants are still able to carry on his ambitions and stand out, which is enough to give our views on life a new enlightenment. This article fully elaborates on the ultimate truth of "accumulating money" and "doing good," and cites facts that are as vivid as a painting. Every word and sentence is written from the experience of his own understanding. We hope that readers will pay close attention to it, which would be fortunate.

There are many wealthy people in Shanghai. I can cite a few examples that I know. One is the Zou family from Jiangxi. I met this wealthy man at the Xiao family's residence in Yangzhou forty years ago. At that time, the Xiao and Zou families were both leaders of the salt merchants. One day, the old man went to the Xiao residence in a fit of anger because he had received a letter from the manager of the Xiangtan branch saying that there was a famine in Hunan, and the government had persuaded him to donate. He had donated 500 taels of silver on behalf of his master. The old man thought he had donated too much, so he was angry. At that time, he was already worth millions, but he was still unwilling to give out 500 taels for relief. Later, he lived in Shanghai. One day, Mr. Tan Zuan was at the same table with him and asked him how he became so wealthy. He said that there was no other way, but to accumulate and not use it. He died in his eighties and left an inheritance of 30 million yuan. His ten children divided the inheritance, but in just over a decade, it was gone. One of the children was slightly better at doing good deeds, so that branch was slightly better off. However, there were also various unexpected declines, and not much was left. According to common sense, no matter what, each branch would have 3 million, and it would not have been possible to lose it all so quickly. However, in fact, it happened so quickly. If you ask how they lost it, readers can close their eyes and imagine the ways that young wealthy men in Shanghai spend money, and you will understand. There is no need to say more. This old man was also engaged in legitimate business and did not take ill-gotten wealth. However, he was greedy and stingy, and when he saw a famine, he was unwilling to give money for relief. He thought that accumulating money and not using it was clever, but he did not know that this kind of thinking completely violated the benevolent and equal good law. Having a heart to be the only wealthy family, and not caring about the life or death of other families, is extremely unkind and unequal. In addition to receiving karmic retribution himself, he will also receive the remaining retribution. The Book of Changes says that the remainder of blessings and calamities controls the solitary wealthy family, causing it to decline especially quickly, so that the public can see the manifestation of the retribution and be able to wake up. The retribution that the person receives himself cannot be seen by people if it is not in this life.

Another example is the Chen family, a land tycoon in Shanghai a dozen years ago, with a family fortune of 40 million yuan. The two brothers each had 20 million. In the 14th year of the Republic of China, I had dinner at his house once. The house was very luxurious, and there was a pair of stone lions in front of the door, which was rare in Shanghai. The four walls of his guest room were lined with glass shelves, and the ancient bronze tripods on display were all 3,000 years old. A guest pointed to them and told me that the bronze utensils in this room were worth 1.5 million yuan. Half of China's famous ancient bronze utensils were here. These words were exactly what the host was most happy to hear. The psychology of the average wealthy person is to boast that the things I have are better than everyone else's. Only scholarship, morality, and reputation cannot be obtained with money, so they have no choice but to compete with each other in clothes, jewelry, houses, and appliances, in order to win the flattery of guests who hope to get benefits. Therefore, the words pride and extravagance are linked. Pride is showing off, and extravagance is being lavish. In Shanghai, we often see extravagant funerals, spending 100,000 to 200,000 yuan in a day to show off. But it is very difficult to get them to give a few thousand yuan to help with disaster relief. This is the base and selfish psychology that most humans have, and I am not just talking about one particular family. This host certainly could not avoid the common practices. Only seven years after I saw him, land prices in Shanghai suddenly plummeted, and he suffered losses from speculation, leading to bankruptcy. Ancient bronze treasures, houses, land, everything, were all confiscated and sold by the bank. The host also moved back to his hometown in the interior.

### Bond Market Expands; Significant Rise Yesterday

The bond market suddenly trended upward yesterday, by a significant amount, the most seen in several days. The situation of stagnation and depression was broken, spurred by sellers covering their positions, showing that the tightness or looseness of credit is not necessarily linked to the rise or fall of bonds. The main key is the environment and people's sentiment. Sellers were also afraid of the red board rising, so they slightly collected. Yesterday, domestic bonds initially traded at around 2 yuan, then quickly rose to over 3 yuan, with a high price of 3.30 yuan. Afterwards, it actually stabilized above 3 yuan, showing a strong trend. Class A bonds were at 2.20 yuan, Class B bonds were at 1.78 yuan, and Class D bonds were bid at 9 yuan and offered at 9.50 yuan, but there were no transactions. Class E bonds were around 0.80 yuan to 1 yuan. Whether the future can continue to rise still depends on the strength of both sides.

### Golden Lily Flowers See Lively Sales in Ningbo

Recently, the only active market for golden lily flowers has been in Ningbo, so the market is unremarkable and peaceful. In addition, as the closure period approaches, firms are bargaining harshly, and few transactions have been made. Yesterday, foreign firms offered over a hundred packages of goods that were still acceptable, and the entire lot was sold for 525 yuan.

### Black Melon Seeds Open for Trading

The supply of black melon seeds from outside continues to arrive in large quantities, but initially, trading did not open due to disagreements with the firm's offer.

The quality of the goods is still dry, with both large and medium-sized seeds available. The opening price was 575 yuan, and trading opened immediately.

### Making a Fortune

— Objective

"Wealth" is what everyone loves. "Making a fortune" is what everyone hopes for.

There are names of no small number of people that contain the meaning of "wealth" and "making a fortune." For example, "Fu Gen" (Rich Root), "Jin Bao" (Gold Treasure), etc. Many families paste red strips of paper on their doorposts that say "Daily Income of a Peck of Gold," "Ten Thousand Taels of Gold," etc. On other people's walls, they paste red strips saying "Generate Wealth for Me." Shopkeepers, every New Year, customarily paste spring couplets, the wording of which all contains the meaning of making a fortune. The most common are: "Business prospers to all corners of the sea, financial resources flourish to the three rivers." When businessmen meet, the first greeting is often: "Where are you making a fortune?"

In the minds of our people, the shortcut to making a fortune is "becoming an official," because "becoming an official and making a fortune" are spoken together. Indeed, in our society, many wealthy families are "families of officials." Our officials' salaries are extremely meager. If officials relied only on their salaries, they could simply starve to death. However, our officials, except for one in a thousand or one in ten thousand honest officials, each has their own way of making money, enjoying sensual pleasures, and "buying fields and gardens for their sons and grandsons."

In recent decades, our people have added another way to make a fortune, which is "making foreign money." This term has a rather bittersweet flavor. The British and American capitalist imperialists invaded our country to exploit and extract from us. However, there are many compradors and foreign slaves who rely on the British and Americans, and their breath, to make a great foreign fortune. Any city in the country with a concession is a paradise for those who make foreign money.

In modern society, "making a fortune" is not considered a bad thing. However, it can be said that none of the sages and great scholars and thinkers, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, have ever made a fortune; and they have shown no enthusiasm for making a fortune. Therefore, sages, scholars, and thinkers are often ridiculed by society, or starve, or face lawsuits.

Some people say that one of Sun Yat-sen's great inventions was the historical view of people's livelihood. Unfortunately, most rich people and those who are keen on making a fortune do not understand this principle. One person and one family's life has already been completely resolved, but they are still obsessed with "wealth," doing the "greedy husband sacrificing himself for wealth" business. Some people die for money before they make a fortune; some people die for money after they make a fortune. The most despicable and pathetic are those fat and bloated misers who only know how to be stingy and collect, accumulating wealth to pass on to their children and grandchildren; suffering those children and grandchildren, who are immersed in smoking, drinking, whoring, and gambling day and night, spending the money earned by their fathers and brothers as if it were dirt.

What is obtained by improper means is often lost by improper means. "Families built on stinginess rarely enjoy it for long." In the eyes of our people, this is karmic retribution, without the slightest deviation. But such a boring new and old metabolism of one family and one clan, everyone does not take it as a warning, and the vitality of society and the nation is greatly damaged!

### A Record of the Empress Listening to Opera

— Hui Lin

The day before yesterday, a friend invited me to the Empress Theater to see Tong Zhiling's "New Opera Fan Miss." When I arrived, Gao Chong was already performing the opening movements. I knew immediately that something was wrong: Sheng Lin had completely changed from the person he was the last time he came to Shanghai with Huang Jin. The opening movements lacked leg lifts, and his whole body was loose. His face was expressionless when taking orders, and a very exciting play passed by so flatly. The scene of guarding the big flag was greatly diminished, simply diminished beyond recognition. In the end, the big split and the small swinging horse were only nominally performed. After splitting down, he couldn't get up for a long time, bent his hind legs, and barely managed to stand straight. If this continues, it is possible that Gao Sheng Lin will perish along with Qiu Sheng Rong.

After a while, Si Lang came on stage, reciting the introduction, his breath was extremely full, earning a full house of applause. His spoken lines were too difficult to hear, probably because he still lacked research on the wording. The long slow tempo aria was not sung very well. Shi Gong's pitch was quite high, but his voice was sometimes not enough to use, and coupled with the lack of attention to wording, it made people feel tired for him. As for charm, there was even less to talk about. Even so, Shi Gong is still young, and his acting style is quite proper. Among the younger generation, he can be considered a rare talent. "Tearfully Crying Out of Yanmen Pass" was sung very movingly. The dialogue in the scene of seeing Zong Bao was very much like Bao Sen. "Boldly Bring the Treasure Tent In" used the back-of-the-head voice, which was again like Xiao Tan. Probably he learned from Xiao Tan when he was studying opera, and later added some Yu-style tunes, which became what it is now.

That day, the princess was played by Tong Zhiling. She used a florid tune in the first sentence of the West River slow tempo aria, which was acceptable. Later, she made a great improvement and a special improvement, even changing the second "Oh, oh, is that so" to "The驸马 heard it." There were many gimmicks, such as "You're so old, why are you still crying for your family?" Her expressions had some elements of civilized drama. She added many "Ah" and "Heh" when responding to the驸马, which was not much different from telling crosstalk.

Cheng Yuqing's Empress Dowager and Li Maikui's Grand Dowager were both good materials, but unfortunately, they were both a bit "wild." Especially Li Maikui, whose voice was originally good enough, now simply couldn't keep up with the erhu, and frequently signaled with her eyes, waiting for the strings to be tuned lower before daring to sing the flowing aria "Upon Seeing the Beautiful Maiden, Tears Fill My Face."

Tong Zhiling's Zong Bao, and a certain Shanghai troupe's Sixth Brother. The performers at the amusement park are probably better than him. After listening to "Visiting Mother," I had no appetite to listen anymore. So I said goodbye to my friend and went home alone.

### Mount Kangchenjunga

— Ding Yanbo

Continuing from the lower part of Mr. Jia Yuan's "Indian-Tibetan Border," published in this newspaper on the 13th, it is said that Mount Kangchenjunga (Kangchenjunga) is not known whether it is Mount Everest and still needs to be verified. According to Mount Kangchenjunga is not Mount Everest. There are many records about Mount Everest, and everyone in the world knows it, so I won’t go into details here. Mount Kangchenjunga, although one of the most famous mountains in the world, is known to fewer people; to know it in detail, the length would be too long, and it must be narrated in another article. Please briefly record it on the left:

Kangchenjunga is the second highest peak in the world. According to the more precise measurement by Mr. Burrard of the Indian Trigonometric Survey Bureau, its height is 28,225 feet; only 916 feet lower than Mount Everest; but its cold and dangerousness exceeds it. Kangchenjunga Peak faces Mount Everest to the west and overlooks Darjeeling to the south. The mountain is located northeast of Nepal and northwest of Sikkim. Its main ridge extends from north-northeast to south-southwest, forming the natural boundary between Nepal and Sikkim, and is the watershed for several major rivers. Twelve miles north of the mountain is the border of Tibet, which is the main watershed of the Himalayas.

Kangchenjunga Mountain is towering and majestic, surrounded by mountains, glaciers and snow valleys, and its terrain is dangerous. It is self-contained as a glacier system. Among the highest peaks in the world, none is more worthy of admiration than this. Peaks such as Everest cannot be glimpsed without deep exploration. And Kangchenjunga Mountain can be seen from the mountain town of Darjeeling, or by climbing the lower hills nearby, to see its wonders.

Among Western explorers, there are many who have tried to climb this mountain. In 1848, the Englishman Sir Hooker first traveled to the mountainous area of Sikkim. After that, mountaineering explorers, surveyors and cartographers, and deep-seated aggressors sprang up one after another; Sikkim's sovereignty was increasingly eroded by the British.

There have also been expeditions specifically aimed at climbing Kangchenjunga. In 1905, 1929, and 1931, there were several mountaineering expeditions. However, after the British achieved their political goals in Nepal and Sikkim, explorers focused on Mount Everest. And climbing Kangchenjunga Mountain is mostly done by Swiss, German, French, and American mountaineering explorers, who are rich in experience in climbing Everest and the Alps, gather the manpower of the indigenous people, and do their best with scientific skills.

### Teacher for All Ages

— Written by James Hiltno, Translated by Yi Jin

(8)

He often remembered in his heart that spring day in 1898 when he seemed to be pacing through the village of Brookfield in some terrible nightmare, struggling to escape to an outside world where the sun was still shining and things looked different. Young Faulkner met him on the path outside the school. "Excuse me, sir, may I have leave this afternoon? My family are all coming."

"Eh? What's the matter? Oh, yes, yes..."

"May I also be excused from reciting, sir?" "Yes... yes..."

"May I also go to the station to meet them?"

He almost wanted to answer: "You can go to hell, it's nothing to do with me. My wife is dead, my child is also dead, I want to find myself and die too."

In fact, he was stumbling along in a daze. He didn't want to talk to anyone or listen to words of condolence; if possible, he wanted to get used to things first, and then listen to other people's kind words. After taking attendance, he went to the fourth class as usual, asking the students to silently study grammar, while he himself stayed at his writing desk, calmly continuing to be lost in thought. Suddenly someone said, "Excuse me, sir, there are many letters for you."

Sure enough, there were many letters: his two elbows were pressing on them: his name was written on their faces. He opened them one by one, but each one contained nothing but a blank sheet of paper. He thought blankly that this was a bit strange, but he didn't say anything; his vast and unsettled mind simply couldn't feel the impact of such a small matter. It wasn't until many days later that he realized that these were some April Fool's Day pranks.

They died on the same day, the mother and the newborn child; on April 1, 1898. (19)

### Health Guidance

— Answered by Dr. Yan Yuqing

(1) Le Cheng asks: The left eye often twitches, for about two months. Sometimes it also twitches when the eyes are closed. The frequency ranges from a momentary twitch to a continuous one or two minutes, causing considerable anxiety. (Answer) This disease is caused by neurasthenia, or due to recent insomnia. Adequate sleep is sufficient. One should not be afraid in spirit, otherwise the twitching will be even worse.

(2) Huang Renlong asks: 1. At the age of seven, eating too many plums caused a cough, which has lasted for fifteen years. I don't know if it is a lung disease? 2. Three years ago, I suffered from Gonagra, and doctors have repeatedly warned that if it is not cured, there is a risk of death. I don't know if it is true. Both of the above symptoms are suffered by one person. Unfortunately, the economy is not sufficient. I hope you can show me a simple and cheap treatment? (Answer) To determine whether it is a lung disease, you can bring the prescription to Renji Hospital for an X-ray examination. It only costs five yuan from 10 to 11 am. Gonagra is knee arthritis. If there is lung disease, it is tuberculous. It is quite difficult to cure. Daily sunlight therapy and taking cod liver oil can prevent the disease from worsening. The so-called sunlight therapy is to expose the affected area to sunlight, starting from five minutes and gradually increasing to ten and a quarter, to twenty minutes. It should get better over time. If the disease does not worsen, there is no danger to life.
