### Japan Strengthens Domestic Posture in Relation to China

The Japanese government, considering the current increasingly tense global war situation, and to establish a sure-win posture for the nation to maintain permanent peace in East Asia, studied the policy of strengthening national policy management last month. In the cabinet meeting on September 21, after seven hours of deliberation, the outline of national policy management was approved. In the cabinet meeting on September 28, in order to realize the strengthening of the domestic system, it was decided to: convene an extraordinary cabinet meeting; establish a Ministry of Munitions. Between these two major decisions, there was the matter of Wang Jingwei's visit to Japan to promote the situation in Japan, which is the most noteworthy new development in recent East Asian affairs. According to an announcement issued by the Japanese Information Bureau, the content of the Japanese government's recently decided policy of strengthening its domestic posture is as follows. The goals of this strengthening are: (A) to make the public thoroughly understand the meaning of this war and to make them realize that its completion is not easy, and to be determined to hold the belief of certain victory and to show unwavering loyalty to the country. (B) To devote national power to rapidly increase production, especially focusing on the replenishment of aviation combat power. (C) To establish absolute self-sufficiency in food for both Japan and Manchukuo. (D) To strengthen domestic defense. From this, it can be seen that this epoch-making decision of Japan is entirely based on the new situation of the world war and adopts a policy of concentrating national strength to ensure a winning position. Looking at the content of the policy to strengthen the domestic situation, it becomes even clearer:

First, it is to realize a decisive battle posture through consistent management. The main and specific policies are: Thorough and rapid implementation of administrative reporting; Thorough simplification of the budget; Thorough simplification of official affairs; Reorganization of administrative agencies, further reduction of administrative personnel; Uninterrupted operation of functions. This administrative policy for war is in line with our government's consistent request for "implementing streamlined administration" and "improving administrative efficiency." It is hoped that a serious and dynamic new atmosphere will be created among all levels of government, without wasting manpower or resources. Time, striving for national prosperity, is truly overcoming current difficulties. Clarifying politics and strengthening government authority and administrative efficiency are prerequisites. Our friendly nation has already taken the lead, and our country should not lag behind. This is the first thing we should strive for.

Second, Japan's policy of strengthening the domestic situation this time also pays special attention to the thorough mobilization of the people. The specific policies are: Stop the general method of drafting ordinary soldiers; Except for students majoring in engineering, a system of delaying entry into the army will be established, and schools that organize and supplement science departments will be consolidated. The scope of major useful applications, those originally exempted from the list other than special recipients, will also be completely abolished. Strengthen women's mobilization. Rapidly implement appropriate job allocation. Abolish the age limit for retirement in various industries and use older people as much as possible. Under a comprehensive plan, the manpower saved will be used to participate in the execution of the war. Continue eight years of compulsory education. All of the above new policies are aimed at thoroughly mobilizing the people to concentrate national strength on the war effort. In terms of manpower, the scope of recruitment will be expanded, stipulating that men aged 14 to 40 in 17 occupations directly related to the war or who can be employed by children are restricted from employment. Therefore, there is a vast field of occupation where women can be mobilized to take on jobs, allowing men to engage in careers directly related to Zhangzhou. This method of thorough mobilization is one of the key factors for victory in today's total war. Looking back at our country, the national strength is still scattered as before. Can we not urgently and directly advance to shoulder the sacred duty of "jointly safeguarding East Asia"? This is the second thing we should strive for.

Third, in order to thoroughly strengthen the domestic defense posture, the policies decided to be adopted are: To realize the unification of domestic defense administrative operations. For important national areas, military and militarily important factories, mines, etc., strengthen air defense capabilities as much as possible. It was decided that the government should take the lead in implementing it, and order all public organizations, various control agencies, and control companies to implement the necessary arrangements in accordance with the government's methods. Implement a comprehensive plan for the evacuation of government offices and other institutions and personnel to various places. Promote the improvement of private enterprises and implement the arrangement of civilian houses and shops in Tokyo and other important cities in accordance with the government's arrangement methods. All of these policies are naturally necessary preparations aimed at the so-called "Pacific Counterattack" of the United States and Britain. The "counterattack" plan clearly includes the conspiracy to use Chinese territory and airspace as a battlefield. Therefore, we must also strive for perfection in all aspects of defense and air defense preparations for important cities, factories, mines, government offices, schools, and civilian houses. Especially in a corner like Shanghai, where the population is concentrated to more than five million, it is not a phenomenon that should exist during a decisive battle. In case of emergency, it can easily lead to unnecessary losses and problems with food and security. Therefore, it is necessary to consider implementing the necessary evacuation work. This is the third thing we should strive for.

In the concrete measures for strengthening the domestic situation in Japan this time, which are implemented in various departments of political affairs, economy, and culture, in addition to those mentioned above, the main ones also include the following: In order to seek a clearer expression of the national character of important enterprises in business management, capital is concentrated on combat power and important tasks, and personnel are reduced. The core of this strengthening of the domestic situation is the close integration of the military and national affairs, so that the public and private sectors can work together with the belief of certain victory to jointly seek the rapid increase of military demand production, especially aviation production. This method of strengthening cooperation between officials and the people, concentrating national strength, strengthening production, and increasing combat power is worth our study and realization. This is the fourth thing we should strive for.

In order to concentrate national strength to increase production and replenish aviation, the Japanese cabinet also decided on September 28 to abolish the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Enterprise Agency and establish a Ministry of Munitions. On the same day, the Japanese cabinet decided to convene an extraordinary meeting from October 25 to present laws and budgets related to national policy management under the current situation. After the parliament faces domestic and foreign countries to express the government's determination to complete the war, it will raise the people's belief in victory and strengthen national unity. In addition to the budget necessary to increase combat power, the bill includes: those related to budget preparation, those related to judicial simplification, those related to munitions companies, those related to strengthening air defense, those related to the duties of parliamentarians, and those that have become increasingly fierce. "Our 100 million people should renew their determination and use their courage to concentrate their total strength on the completion of the war. Special research. At this critical moment, consistent loyalty is the root of our country's sure victory." In fact, this is not only the responsibility of Japan's 100 million people, but also the common responsibility of the 1 billion people of East Asia.

At the time of Japan's strengthening of its domestic situation, the visit of our Chairman Wang to Japan and the comings and goings of Ambassador Gu and Ambassador Cai between Tokyo and Nanjing, we firmly believe that there will be major developments in the further strengthening of Sino-Japanese relations in the future and the promotion of the total war between China and Japan. However, the factors to gain a favorable position lie in seeking the right track of politics, as well as in improving the people's livelihood and further promoting the concentration of national strength, so as to be able to shoulder our mission, and work together with Japan to jointly ensure the liberation of the East Asian nations and permanent peace in the Pacific.

As for the specific plans for the reorganization of internal agencies and affairs of various provinces, each department is currently drafting them as soon as possible. Due to this measure, personnel in various aspects may have military service and transfer to other unions. Therefore, these personnel are in a more necessary position to implement the war.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is being reorganized, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is renamed the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. Matters related to transactions are transferred to the management of the Greater East Asia Ministry. The reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will be implemented from November 1st. The relevant authorities are currently preparing as soon as possible. (B) Matters concerning the establishment of the Ministry of Transportation and Communication. The Japanese government is based on the outline of national policy management under the current situation. In order to expedite the comprehensive transportation by sea and land and seek to exert wartime communication power, the Ministry of Transportation and Communication was established. The Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications were abolished. The Ministry of Transportation and Communication is formed on the basis of the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications, and is in charge of comprehensive transportation by sea and land and matters related to it, as well as matters related to communication. In order to accomplish the above-mentioned purposes, the customs, warehouses, ports, civil engineering, port affairs, and other port affairs administration, automobile transportation administration, and other matters necessary for transportation, which are managed by other provinces, are transferred to the management of the Ministry of Transportation and Communication. Measures will be taken to make active military officers of the army and navy officials of the Ministry of Transportation and Communication. When planning the organization of the Ministry of Transportation and Communication, the main goal should be to make its organization frugal and powerful, and more attention should be paid to avoid reducing its efficiency. The Ministry of Transportation and Communication will begin its work on November 1st. The relevant authorities are currently preparing as soon as possible. (Remarks) Regarding the land transportation between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, it was decided to take measures that can be used consistently. Matters related to electricity under the jurisdiction of the former Ministry of Communications should be transferred to the management of the Ministry of Munitions.

### Germany Occupies Venice Port, Italian Guards Disarmed, German Troops Withdraw from Naples in the South

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports: After the naval fort in Venice was occupied by German troops, two Italian generals and 50 Italian soldiers were disarmed. The surrender of Venice was due to the fierce shelling of the port by German torpedo boats against the Italian army's coastal artillery. The Italian troops were disarmed by a small team of German soldiers. German naval lieutenant Smith, in front of the representatives of the senior officials and civilians, the chief of medicine and the local officials of Venice, announced the conditions of surrender. His report to the German naval commander in Italy stated: "Two Italian generals and 15,000 soldiers of the Venice artillery team have been captured."

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The military correspondent Setoris of the Haitong News Agency said: Allied forces continued to land a fresh army in ports such as Tarentum and Brindisi. Some of this fresh army is assisting the British Eighth Army, but most of it seems to be using La Puhaha as a springboard to attack the Balkans. According to reports, the US Seventh Army's whereabouts are unknown after the Sicily campaign.

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Haitong News Agency reports that according to responsible sources, German troops withdrew from the city of Naples on Friday. The city was severely damaged. US troops attempted to follow up and advance at noon on Friday, but were repelled by the German rearguard forces on both sides of Mount Vesuvius.

Naples, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency war correspondent Weber said: At 6:00 pm on September 28, a Communist traitor group attempted to seize power in Naples. At that time, the German demolition team was busy destroying the last important military equipment in the city. Thousands of civilians suddenly opened fire on the team and attacked the German mechanized units. The German soldiers shot alone in the streets were also ambushed, and bombs were thrown in front of the German authorities. The traitors even implemented a cordon around the hospital where German wounded soldiers were staying. They thought that the US Fifth Army could be expected to occupy Naples that night, but the German troops were still making strong resistance at various points, so the progress of the Anglo-American forces was very slow. Therefore, the new war zone in the city of Naples was isolated. The German commander immediately took countermeasures and sent troops into the city to suppress the rebels. The wounded soldiers have been rescued. The rebel resistance points are now in the area around the station and the main roads in the city. Machine guns are erected at high places, but the German troops fought hard with them and have turned the tide. The traitors' actions were obviously planned for a long time, so they launched the attack when there were few German troops in the city. Now, the rapid action of the German troops and the failure of the US troops to enter the city in time have made them quite frightened.

### Aisenhower and Badoglio in Discussions Regarding the Status of Belligerent Nations

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Washington (Haitong News Agency) - A senior U.S. official with close ties to Italian developments stated yesterday that General Dwight D. Eisenhower and Marshal Pietro Badoglio are currently holding meetings to discuss the recognition of the Badoglio regime as a co-belligerent. This move has the consent of both the British and Soviet governments. The purpose of this recognition is to counteract Mussolini's appeal to the Italian people.

### Fierce German Counterattacks on the Lower Dnieper River; Both Armies Vie for Bridgeheads on the West Bank

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - German authorities announced on the 1st that in recent days, German resistance has been increasing in several areas on the Eastern Front. Fierce German counterattacks are particularly intense in the area between Zaporozhye and Melitopol on the lower Dnieper River. The Soviet army had already intensified its attacks five days ago, and on September 30th, it deployed new troops – three corps consisting of 15 infantry divisions, tank brigades, and numerous artillery units – in an attempt to break through the approximately 118-kilometer German defensive line between Zaporozhye and Melitopol. However, after several successive strong defensive battles, the German army has repelled the attacks. The Soviet army deployed 250 tanks, of which 140 were destroyed. The increased German resistance in this area is the result of the recent shortening of the battle line. The German line has now been shortened by about 100 kilometers, and the remaining troops are being used to strengthen the defensive line. It remains unclear whether the German command will permanently maintain the current line. In the central section of the Dnieper River, the Soviet army has established bridgeheads on the west bank, and fierce battles are currently underway between the German and Soviet armies for control of these bridgeheads. Due to rainfall, the Soviet army has only launched localized attacks on the central front. On the northern front, the Soviet army has attempted localized attacks in several locations, but they have been repelled by the German army. In the Kupen bridgehead area, the Soviet army has launched repeated attacks and has even attempted landings behind German lines, but all have been repelled by the German army.

### Wartime Soviet Diplomacy - An Analysis of Soviet War Power, Part 3 (1) - The Soviet Attitude Towards the War

During wartime, just as politics and economics are subordinate to the supreme command of war, diplomacy also operates according to the demands of war. Therefore, one of a nation's diplomatic efforts is to ensure that the development of the war situation is favorable to itself. Conversely, the course of the war determines the direction that diplomacy should take. Soviet diplomacy, needless to say, is no exception to this. To examine the essence of Soviet wartime diplomacy, one must first define the Soviet attitude towards the war.

From the Soviet perspective, the current world war revolves around the German-Soviet war. The other battles in Europe, the attitude towards Britain and the United States, and the attitude towards the Greater East Asia War, are all derived from and centered on the German-Soviet war.

On July 3, 1941, after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, Stalin addressed the nation, calling the German-Soviet war a "war of the fatherland" and even a "war for the defense of the fatherland." These simple words explained the Soviet war aims and clarified the Soviet attitude towards the war.

The media organs of Britain and the United States, especially Hanson W. Baldwin, the military correspondent for the New York Times, have repeatedly criticized the Soviet Union for waging war for its own sake. No country is willing to wage war for another country. Even Britain and the United States are fighting for their own interests, so their criticism is groundless. In the complex and intertwined interests of the current world war, the Soviet attitude is clearly not very appropriate.

In order to effectively wage war against Germany, the Soviet Union allied itself with Britain and the United States, despite their fundamentally opposing ideologies and policies. The demands for a second front in Europe and for material assistance were all for the sake of freedom. However, to put it bluntly, the Soviet Union was simply using Britain and the United States to defeat Germany.

In order to achieve its goal of defeating Germany, the Soviet Union was willing to ally itself not only with Britain and the United States, but even with Poland. Therefore, the Soviet government's external pronouncements were very cautious, never deviating from this framework.

An example of this is the Soviet Union's policy of non-participation in the Greater East Asia War. This was, of course, due to the neutrality treaty concluded between Japan and the Soviet Union in 1941. Therefore, while the United States found it difficult to refuse Soviet requests, helping and lending weapons to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union consistently refused to participate in the Greater East Asia War and refused to lend its bases in East Asia to the United States. All of this stemmed from the necessities of the German-Soviet war.

Moreover, the demands of the German-Soviet war were not fixed and immutable, but were influenced by changes in the European war situation. As for the present, there is no sign of any change in these fundamental Soviet policies.

This frank Soviet attitude towards the war determined its diplomatic policy. As will be discussed later, this had a significant impact on the issue of a second front in Europe and on the lack of unified coordination within the anti-Axis alliance. Furthermore, it raised other fundamental questions.

The Increase in Speaking Rights

As everyone knows, before the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, Britain was on the verge of collapse. In reality, Britain was bearing the brunt of the German military power. However, as a result of the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the Soviet Union relieved Britain of the heavy pressure of the German army, for which Britain was truly grateful. During the German-Soviet war, Britain seized the opportunity to reorganize its military strength. The relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union originated from this situation. Not long after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, Britain and the Soviet Union concluded a military alliance treaty. Later, the United States and the Soviet Union also concluded a military alliance. However, despite the so-called alliance relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union continued to bear the heavy burden of the European war. This situation could not but increase the Soviet Union's speaking rights vis-à-vis Britain, and further increase the Soviet Union's speaking rights vis-à-vis the United States, with Britain acting as an intermediary.

In fact, when the Soviet Union demanded a second front from Britain and the United States, it often emphasized the fact that the Soviet Union was bearing almost the entire pressure of the German military power. In particular, on the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet regime on November 7 of last year, Stalin attributed the heavy losses suffered by the Soviet Union in the summer campaign of last year to the lack of a second front in Europe, namely that the Soviet Union was bearing the entire burden of the European war, and harshly criticized Britain and the United States.

The Anglo-American invasion of French North Africa, which began on November 8 of last year, brought about some changes in the European war situation. At least militarily, the United States seemed to be blocking the Soviet Union's claims, although politically it seemed to harbor some intentions.

However, Stalin did not regard the Anglo-American operations in French North Africa as a second front in Europe, but merely defined it as a foothold. The claim that the Soviet Union was bearing the entire burden of the European war had not been withdrawn.

Moreover, as the Tunisian campaign drew to a close, Stalin said in his Proclamation No. 195 on May 1 of this year:

"The strike of the Red Army from the east and the strike of the anti-Axis forces from the west have merged into one strike."

Therefore, the Soviet Union's view that the anti-Axis operations in North Africa were not a second front remained unchanged from before.

After the first winter counteroffensive and the second winter counteroffensive, the Soviet Union's speaking rights vis-à-vis Britain and the United States further increased. At the Casablanca Conference in January of this year, Britain and the United States issued a special declaration of "Europe First," which, regardless of whether it was a practical necessity, could be interpreted as flattery towards the Soviet Union. Also, at the Anglo-American Washington Conference in May of this year, it was declared that the "Europe First" principle remained unchanged, but this was also out of fear of the Soviet Union!

The most obvious manifestation of this increase in the Soviet Union's speaking rights vis-à-vis Britain and the United States was the Soviet-Polish diplomatic issue. The details of the breakdown of Soviet-Polish relations are well known, and there is no need to repeat them here. This issue originated from the Soviet Union's forcing Poland to recognize the old sovereignty, which undoubtedly indicated the Soviet Union's overbearingness. Moreover, the fact that Britain disregarded Poland, which had been Britain's lapdog in Eastern Europe since the First World War, clearly showed the increase in the Soviet Union's speaking rights.

Stalin, in answering questions from the New York Times and the Moscow correspondent of The Times, Parker, on May 4, declared recognition of Poland's independence, but this was limited to Stalin's recognition of the independence of a Polish republic that would become part of the Soviet Union. It had no other meaning. Recently, as the Anglo-American air forces have intensified their bombing of Europe and carried out the invasion of Sicily, the Soviet Union's speaking rights have inevitably decreased somewhat. Perhaps for this reason, the Soviet Union has abandoned its previous policy of attrition and begun its so-called summer offensive.

The Soviet Union's decision to launch a "summer offensive" may be to show the increased combat power of the Red Army, or it may be a military necessity in response to the Sicilian operations. The Soviet Union seems to be regaining some of the speaking rights it had lost, so it can also be interpreted as originating from political motives. In short, as long as Britain and the United States do not open a second front in Europe, the Soviet Union will not lose its advantage in its speaking rights vis-à-vis Britain and the United States.

### Southern Control Committee Improves Application Procedures

The Commerce Control Committee is extremely cautious in handling the import or export of major food items. To facilitate merchants and citizens, it has repeatedly improved the application procedures. According to a reporter's investigation, the committee has recently noted that many applications received by the Permit Affairs Group in the past have been rejected or returned for resubmission due to non-compliance with the procedures. In the past, the reviewer only wrote the reasons on the application form, and the staff in charge of receiving and sending the application would then hand the application to the applicant to read. This often led to misunderstandings. To ensure that merchants and citizens thoroughly understand the reasons, the committee has printed a form listing the reasons for the return or rejection of applications. In the future, all applications will be accepted. If, after review, an application does not comply with the procedures and cannot be approved or must be returned, the form will be filled out, clearly stating the reasons for the rejection or return, and the form will be stamped with the group's seal to indicate its solemnity.

Economic Circles: Commentary

### Flour and Wheat Exchange

A delegation from the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the National Commercial Control Association, seeing the severity of the food situation in North China, took a flight north yesterday to discuss the exchange of flour and wheat. This is because we recall the conversation between Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Finance and the Mayor of Shanghai Chen during their meeting with journalists in North China in April this year. Mr. Zhou said: "North China is the North China of the Central Government, and the Central Government is the Central Government of North China. The National Government will do its utmost to provide relief for the food problem in North China, and to facilitate the exchange of materials and the transaction of funds." Mr. Chen said: "Regardless of the north or south, the economy must be exchanged, and food is only a part of the economy." Therefore, we once wrote on May 5 this year, under the title "Economic Exchange is Necessary," that we can draw a conclusion from the remarks of Zhou and Chen, that is, the solution to the current serious food problem should still be based on economic exchange as the basic principle.

The so-called flour and wheat exchange is a three-way exchange method: first, use wheat loans to purchase wheat in the Central China region; second, allocate all the purchased wheat to factories for flour production; and third, transport the remaining flour to North China for relief as much as possible. Such a continuous triangular exchange method can enable wheat-producing areas to sell their products, thereby invigorating the rural economy; flour mills to work hard to produce, in order to meet the needs of distribution; and food-scarce areas to obtain flour for disaster relief, achieving a win-win situation.

Even taking the food problem in Shanghai as an example, it is not without a still serious trend. Therefore, we once said: "This year, there has been a bumper harvest of rice in various parts of Central China. Logically, this phenomenon should not exist. The key lies in the fact that farmers value physical objects and are unwilling to release their stored grain as much as possible. It is urgent to take advantage of the situation and release a large amount of cotton cloth to exchange for rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains to solve the food problem in the city." Therefore, the exchange of cotton cloth and grain is as important as the exchange of flour and wheat. It's just that the grain is produced this year. If unlimited grain is exchanged for limited cotton cloth, it still seems not thorough. Therefore, in addition to the purchase of cotton cloth, the production of cotton cloth must be planned for the future.

### Enthusiastic Buyers of "Wealth Preservation Method," Mr. Xiang Kang-yuan Donates 2,000 Copies

After Mr. Nie Yun-tai's article "Wealth Preservation Method" was printed into 50,000 copies in a separate booklet after Mr. Kuchaizhai donated a large sum of 100,000 yuan, he also donated 20,000 copies to this newspaper. The cost was retailed at two yuan per copy, and the income was used for student aid and poverty relief. It went on sale at the business department yesterday. After the news spread, there was an enthusiastic response from buyers, with more than 500 copies sold. Yesterday, Mr. Xiang Kang-yuan, manager of Kangyuan Canning Factory, donated 2,000 copies for distribution to the industrial and commercial sectors. Taihexiang Xu Zhenjia also distributed them at Fazang Temple and Zhuangyan Temple yesterday, benefiting others and oneself, which can be described as a win-win situation. Groups and schools can send letters to request them.

### Industrial and Commercial Association Held Third Member Congress Yesterday, Elected Third Council

Central News Agency: The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association, initiated and organized by the Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial circles, has held two sessions of development since its establishment on September 3 last year. At 5:30 pm yesterday (the 2nd), the third member congress was held in the conference of the association, and the Chinese and Japanese officials attended to guide. The third council was elected on the spot. The details are as follows:

Grand Occasion of the Congress

Chinese and Japanese officials: Including Mayor Chen of the Municipal Government, Secretary-General Zhao Zun-yue, Deputy Director Su Cheng-de of the First Police Bureau, Director Liang Xiu-yu of the Propaganda Department, Minister Tajiri of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, Secretary Iwai, Vice-Consul Fukuma, and Interpreter Hirata, etc., and more than 100 members of the association. The congress was presided over by Wen Lan-ting, who gave the opening speech. The candidates for the council were nominated. Then, the Chinese and Japanese officials gave speeches in succession. Then, Toraji Kurimoto reported on the association's affairs over the past year. Finally, the newly appointed Chairman Takeo Komuro took office and gave an inaugural speech. After the meeting, a frugal vegetable dinner was held. During the dinner, the Deng Wenqing Troupe performed magic, students from the Shanghai Drama School performed Peking Opera, and the Greater East Asia News Film was shown. The gathering ended happily at 10 pm. The chairman's speech briefly stated: "Our association has been established for a year, and with the support of all parties, the association's affairs are progressing day by day. This association was initiated and organized by people from the Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial sectors. The common purpose is to communicate the will of the industrial and commercial sectors of both sides and to complete the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere through the cooperation of both sides. Since its establishment, although the colleagues have limited abilities, they have all been moving forward towards this goal, contributing to the construction of Greater East Asia. This congress coincides with the first anniversary. According to the regulations, the members of the council should be re-elected. In addition to the new list of council members to be announced separately, the chairmanship is taken by both sides in turn. Therefore, Mr. Komuro is invited to take the position this time. In the future, under the leadership of Mr. Komuro, the association's affairs will have more development, which can be expected."

Zhao Zun-yue's Speech

Briefly stated: "In terms of the Greater East Asia, the scope is very broad. Shanghai is the most important industrial and commercial hub. Looking back on the past, the industrial and commercial development of Shanghai was controlled by the British and Americans. It is difficult for people in Greater East Asia to take the lead. It is now up to our people to take responsibility for revitalizing industry and commerce. The Industrial and Commercial Association is organized by people from the industrial and commercial circles of China and Japan. Its mission is important not only because of the emotional contact in business, but also to promote the cooperation between China and Japan through the convenience of this association."

Tajiri's Speech

Briefly stated: "The Industrial and Commercial Association communicates the will of the industrial and commercial circles of China and Japan. Both sides cooperate and communicate, and the understanding of the general public is very deep. I express my gratitude to you here. Now, during the Greater East Asia War, China and Japan should be closer. I would like to state three points: Japan respects China's autonomy. China and Japan mutually enhance production and development. The unfortunate frictions that occurred between China and Japan in the past were caused by the British and Americans挑拨.除英美魔力, 骗出东亚, 日本对除英美魔力, 骗出东亚, 日本对除英美魔力, 骗出东亚, 日本对此莫不尽量努力. Regarding these three points, in this Greater East Asia War, the relationship between China and Japan has been on the right track, and the construction of Greater Shanghai especially depends on the cooperation of you all to achieve success."

Sports

### International Tennis Tournament Successfully Concluded, Chinese Team Wins Championship, Japanese Team Defeated 2-1

In the China-Japan-France-Portugal International Charity Tennis Tournament, the Chinese team defeated the Japanese team 2-1 in the final yesterday and won the championship. The performance was quite wonderful. The Mei Tong Public School was crowded with enthusiastic spectators. After the match, Mayor Chen presented the awards, and the event was successfully completed. The results of yesterday's competition are as follows:

First Singles: Tao Guan-qiu (China) defeated Baba (Japan) 6-1, 6-2.

Second Singles: Zhang Ding-zhao (China) defeated Isobe Kameo 7-5, 6-2.

Doubles: Yamaishi Seiichi and Fukushi Saburo (Japan) defeated Zhou Guan-jun and Cai Bao-heng 6-0, 6-3.

Yesterday, China won two singles matches, while Japan only won one doubles match, which was the reason for the defeat. Zhang Dingzhao's victory over Isobe in the second singles match laid the foundation for the victory, as each side would win one of the remaining singles and doubles matches. Isobe was aggressive when he came on the court and won the first three games, but unfortunately, he lacked strength later. Zhang came from behind. The Chinese team's doubles pairing was not good. Liang Deguang was absent, and Cai Guo-heng was used instead, resulting in no resistance. Guo-heng made many mistakes and had unstable striking skills, which was not enough to be an international representative. Finally, in the singles match, Baba tried his best to resist Tao Guan-qiu, but to no avail, and only won three games in the entire match.

### The Flour Committee Settles the Flour Bran Distribution Plan

The National Commercial Control Association's Flour and Wheat Professional Committee will uniformly purchase wheat, and loans will be provided by the Bank of China consortium and Japanese banks through commercial bill discounting. Separate spot contracts will be signed, and each flour manufacturer and commissioned merchant will purchase in accordance with the interim plan for the unified purchase of wheat and in accordance with the standard price list for wheat.

After the implementation of the purchase, it is heard that the purchased wheat will be allocated to each flour mill for processing and flour production. Now, the meeting is aware that the flour bran produced by each flour mill has been shipped one after another. In order to maintain food security and ensure military needs, it has been planned in a unified manner.

The centralized distribution method, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of the association's provisional regulations, the flour bran will be uniformly collected and distributed by the association, and an appropriate price will be set based on the standard price of wheat and manufacturing costs, in order to take into account the factory's cost and the future selling price. The Chinese and Japanese members of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee have properly formulated the interim plan for the centralized distribution of flour bran, which consists of sixteen articles and has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for the record.

### Opinions on the Food Problem—Special Issue Three—The Origin of the Food Problem

— Yao Cuqian

When we speak of food, we usually refer to rice. However, those who wish to address the food problem should include all food and fuel.

The food problem should not have become a problem, nor should it be allowed to become one. Once it becomes a problem, people become anxious, and its fluctuations affect the entire society. The severity of its impact on the national economy and people's livelihood is unparalleled. And the solution must also be approached with caution.

Causes of the Problem

Broadly speaking, the causes of panic in the wartime food problem are due to:

The shrinking of cultivated areas. Firstly, vast areas in the front lines become battlefields, and the two armies are in contention, making it impossible to carry out agricultural activities on good farmland. Secondly, bandits and stray soldiers harass rural areas, and farmers' lives and agricultural products are not guaranteed, making it impossible for them to farm with peace of mind. The shrinking of cultivated areas directly affects the reduction of agricultural output.

The concentration of population. People retreat from the front lines to the rear, and from rural areas to cities. The safe areas in the rear invisibly absorb population and increase it significantly, disrupting the original natural laws of regulating surpluses and deficits. This situation is particularly evident in cities that rely on external supply, and panic is particularly severe.

The lack of rural labor. The supply of conscripts and the absorption of labor by military production departments lead to a large number of farmers leaving the countryside. During the busy farming season, it is difficult to hire short-term workers, and wages are exorbitant, which naturally reduces agricultural output.

Inconvenient transportation. The exchange of urban industrial products and agricultural products depends entirely on convenient transportation. However, the requisition of transportation tools during wartime, the blockade and isolation of strategic areas, and the oppression of good people by bandits and thugs all hinder convenient and safe transportation, resulting in cities lacking agricultural products and rural areas lacking industrial products.

Military supply. Military victory depends on various conditions, and an uninterrupted supply of grain is one of the main conditions. Large-scale purchases and reserves are inevitable, making the already insufficient agricultural products even more scarce.

Solutions

The analysis above is roughly correct. In response to this, the countermeasures are: Develop cultivated land. All available open spaces that can be used for cultivation should be utilized to the greatest extent possible to increase the cultivated area. After clearing rural areas and ensuring good order and security, farmers should be encouraged to return to their farms, so that cultivators have a place to use their skills, and the land is used to its full potential, so that output can naturally increase.

Disperse the urban population. Since farmers have returned to the countryside, those who do not need to stay in the city should also be moved to the countryside, so that the population ratio between urban and rural areas is not too different, which will reduce the severity of the urban food problem.

After developing cultivated land, returning farmers to the countryside, and dispersing the urban population, the surplus labor in the cities can be used for agricultural work, so that the supply and demand of labor can be properly adjusted. If people are used to their full potential, the food problem can also be partially solved.

Facilitate transportation and ensure safety. On the one hand, all existing transportation tools should be organized and properly controlled to ensure their full utilization. The government should also strengthen medical and health services to maintain the safety of the routes. On the other hand, friendly nations should be consulted to assist in smoothing the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, so that goods flow freely and needs are met, which will benefit the food problem.

For military supply, it is best to specify the quantity and delineate the area, stating how much each area should bear within a certain period. If there is a shortage, it should be compensated by allocations from neighboring areas. In this way, food can be obtained locally, which avoids procurement issues and provides a clear understanding of the production and sales volume of each area, allowing for confident adjustment and distribution.

The above are the main methods to solve the wartime food problem.

The Issue of Increasing Production

In addition, there are several issues worth discussing. One is the issue of increasing food production.

China's agricultural economy is a small-scale peasant production system, and production methods and tools are Asian and primitive, which is a major obstacle to technological improvement and increased production. Model farms and demonstration farms should be established, and scientific methods and new facilities should be used to improve technology, so that farmers can learn from them and increase production. The government should also announce a plan to encourage production. Those whose harvests exceed the standard should be rewarded; those who invent or improve agricultural production techniques and tools should also be given preferential rewards.

School authorities should supervise students to go to the fields and make it a compulsory extracurricular activity. Schools with campuses or sports fields should be converted into farms to grow vegetables and raise livestock to provide students with side dishes. Public places should also be used as farms, and the planting of all non-essential agricultural products, such as tobacco, should be prohibited.

Agricultural tools should be sold to farmers at a fair and reasonable price. Bean cakes are as expensive as one or two hundred yuan, and fertilizer powder is rationed in small quantities, making fertilization difficult. Efforts should be made to reduce the price and increase the ration appropriately to reduce the cost of agricultural products.

The Issue of Rationing

The second is the issue of food rationing. Every city should implement public sales based on the county as a unit. The quantity and price of rations should take into account the affordability of the people; the household registration survey should be detailed and accurate, and false reports and exaggerations should not be allowed; the amount of private storage should be regulated, and those who exceed the quota should be punished. Rationing should also be timed and quantified to reassure the people. Those who handle the rations and have the evil behavior of deducting rations should be encouraged to report and severely punish them. Furthermore, large-scale agricultural product warehouses and cold storage warehouses should be operated by the public to regulate surpluses and deficits, in order to facilitate procurement and storage. All competent government agencies related to food should be aware of "not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality," and they should communicate with each other and closely coordinate to achieve orderly progress and fair and equitable distribution of food.

The Issue of Consumption

Third, the issue of food consumption. The people should be aware of the inevitable shortage of food during wartime. They should change the habit of overeating to reduce consumption. It is enough to just fill the stomach, and there is no need to overeat and hurt the stomach.

Because the amount of rice per household is too small, the general residents have gradually become accustomed to using miscellaneous grains to fill their stomachs, and have corrected the idea that rice is the only necessary staple food. This trend should be popularized and actively promoted to reduce rice consumption.

To reduce rice consumption, brewing alcohol and wine lees should be prohibited. For fine and exquisite cakes, teas, and foods that are not made from fruits, heavy taxes should be levied. The scale of social banquets should be re-determined, and progressive tax rates should be applied. The more expensive the dishes, the higher the tax rate should be. The substantial tax revenue can be used to run public canteens, provide affordable rations of various foods and fuel, and issue food coupons and canteen coupons to facilitate the majority of middle and lower-class citizens.

### The Adjustment and Strategy of Shanghai's Food Rationing Agency (II)

— Huang Chuisheng

The Unevenness of Food Distribution "Waves"—The food distribution system can generally be divided into three types: one is the free trade system, one is the government's direct management and distribution system, and the other is the food coupon system. Of the above three systems, except for the first, the second and third are currently implemented in Shanghai, as described above. The so-called government direct management and distribution system is like the current Shanghai-organized Commercial Control Association or various rationing organizations, although these are organized by the people, government personnel are often behind the scenes. During the Great War, Germany organized the Wartime Nutrition Department and established the Public Welfare Wartime Materials Company as a supply mechanism, and later established the Imperial Grain Bureau. This organizational system is the same method as the Commercial Control Association today. As for the food coupon system, all countries have adopted it, and its popularity is no less than the principle of buying a ticket to enter a theater. However, the problem of food rationing quantity in Shanghai today is really serious. Although Jiangsu Province today does not need external supply of food, why do we allow our people to sigh about hunger and thirst? It must be known that the government should stipulate the minimum total amount of sacrifice for distribution and must not arbitrarily increase or decrease it.

Not only that, we also know that there are other factors that determine the amount of food consumption, such as the difference in food intake between men and women in rural areas and men and women in cities, and the difference in food intake between different ages, which are all of great importance. How many meals can Shanghai citizens actually fill their stomachs with the food they receive each period? The authorities should seriously consider this serious issue.

In addition, we should pay attention to the equal distribution of quantities among citizens. We must ask our authorities to implement a "treat everyone equally" policy and grant equal obligations to all Shanghai citizens.

Implementation of Food Consumption Savings—Increasing income and reducing expenditure is the obligation of all our citizens today. To supply the entire city with limited resources, we must strive for savings. However, the way to save is to have the people voluntarily implement it and to have the state implement it. Now, I will briefly describe it as follows:

Voluntary Savings by the People—In this time of life and death, if the people can understand the important relationship between food and war, they should voluntarily initiate clothing and food savings to meet the urgent needs of the country. Actively initiate a "Food Savings Movement" to spread to cities and towns across the country, with the aim of saving the amount of food, meat, sugar, oil, etc. used by the people in their families. And our government should first give encouragement and guidance. Order all educational institutions in the city, regardless of large, medium, or small schools, to give appropriate education during commemorative events, and not to arbitrarily waste general consumer goods, or to teach general store employees the common knowledge of saving for the people. To give citizens a scientific understanding of the value of food and its consumption in each family, and to implement it by means of newspapers and school lectures.

Distribute documents about food knowledge, the types of which can be divided into:

(A) How to avoid waste.

(B) What can be used for cooking.

(C) Comparison of the ingredients of brown rice and white rice.

(D) Soybeans contain rich vitamins.

(E) Drying methods for fruits and vegetables and their manufacturing processes.

(F) How to store sweet potatoes for a long time.

(G) Encourage citizens to grow vegetables in small gardens.

The above is the responsibility that Shanghai citizens should have today. Although Shanghai newspapers are promoting this initiative, its thorough spirit has not been seen. For example, restaurants, hotels, tea rooms, and cafes remain the same. So-called Western food costs hundreds of yuan per dish, and Chinese food costs more than a thousand yuan per table, which are all common occurrences and should be prohibited.

Mandatory Savings by the State; As mentioned above, looking at the spirit of self-government of Shanghai citizens today, if we want to save, I am afraid that its effectiveness cannot be fully realized, and as a result, the government has no choice but to make it necessary to force everyone to save consumption. If all our authorities are aware of this, they should quickly set a clear limit on all large and small restaurants and hotels, and the proportion per person should not exceed the government's publicly determined standard price, in order to embrace the spirit of sharing weal and woe and implement a consistent policy of "matching words with actions."

Strengthen the Control of Rationing Agencies—Since the food control policy is as described above, as for how to improve the health of the rationing agency, a food control and rationing agency must be established to make overall plans. The Shanghai City Front was composed of the Huazhong Grain Rationing Association, which allocated rice to the former Shanghai Municipal Council and the Municipal Grain Bureau, and then distributed it to registered stores for citizens to obtain with tickets. Since July of this year, it has been transferred to the Joint Venture, but because the organization is unsound, it has not been effective.

Looking at the examples of Europe, the matter of food control and rationing should be handled directly by the government. Now that our authorities have transferred it to private operation, it is conceivable. Therefore, the government should lend a helping hand to facilitate transportation and avoid the harm of miscellaneous taxes. As Mr. Zhang Yunbo said in the Sunday Review of the Shen Bao on September 5: "The tax rates and regulations are fixed, and they are not afraid of being responsible, but the checkpoints and inspection workers are as strict as a net, not letting a single thread slip through, and the amount may be doubled by the public. Criminals are even more manipulative and complicit, making rice prices rise higher and higher..." How can this be the trend of the times? Now, to adjust its sound structure, it may be briefly described below for the reference of those who are fighting.

Its organizational scope includes: Production Control Group. Consumption Control Group. Price Control Group, Distribution Control Group, Trade Control Group.

The duties of these five groups are to pay attention to the needs and supply and demand of food for citizens. Two-sixths of the members should be the current deans of Shanghai universities, and the employment of lower-level talents should be cautious.

Forcibly Disperse the Population The food problem is closely related to the size of the population. Today, the population of Shanghai has increased to more than five million. This increase has caused the food supply to gradually decrease. Therefore, the population must be forcibly dispersed. The country has created a class of dancing vagrants, which not only affects law and order but also endangers the people's food. Therefore, in the second household survey conducted by He Jia this time, close attention should be paid to these unemployed people and reported to the authorities. Our authorities should adopt a policy of forced return to the countryside to prevent these people from becoming parasites.

Conclusion

In discussing people and things, there is always something to discuss. Now, when discussing rice, it can prove the ancient people's foresight of "the people take food as their heaven." Today, in the city of Shanghai, the food problem is extremely important and is regarded as a serious matter. Therefore, all citizens must strive to be diligent and thrifty, save clothing and eat, and strive to stabilize their lives. Alas, if the people are not at peace, how can they be safe and undisturbed?
