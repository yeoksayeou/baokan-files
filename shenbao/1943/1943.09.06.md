### Strict Official Conduct

On the third of this month, we published an article titled "Importance of Political Responsibility," in which we stated that the government should emphasize responsibility for dereliction of duty by officials, clearly define rewards and punishments, and not merely dismiss officials. Politics without accountability leads to a lack of discipline, right and wrong, and efficiency. We specifically emphasized: "The revival of the Chinese nation and the stability of people's lives depend on the integrity of politics, which must begin with clear rewards and punishments." We are aware that our tone may have been stern and our emotions intense, but we dare say that our attitude of protecting the government is very frank and pure.

In that commentary, we cited two examples. The first concerned a lapse in inspection by a police precinct chief in this city. We have since received a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Government Secretariat. In addition to publishing the full text of the original letter after this commentary, we feel compelled to add a few words.

First, we must state that in any of our discussions or examples, we have never dared to distort the facts or blindly follow the crowd. If our arguments are based on inaccuracies or are biased, we will openly accept corrections and never shirk responsibility. We will call "yes" what is "yes" and "no" what is "no," and will not attempt to reverse the truth. We do not want to sensationalize or fabricate stories to cater to public opinion. Moreover, the general public has no time to be happy about official misconduct. If, as reporters, we were to distort the facts in order to cater to public opinion, it would be akin to reveling in misfortune, which we consider most undesirable. The example we cited was also based on some evidence, but we are not at liberty to elaborate here. A separate letter of reply has been prepared, and we believe the authorities will sympathize with our position. Because we dare not remain silent about what we believe is dangerous, we will speak frankly, even if it is unpleasant for public opinion or a few individuals to hear. We have maintained this attitude consistently since our republication at the end of last year. As for right and wrong, praise and blame, society will make its own judgment, and we neither calculate nor desire to calculate it.

Generally, when politics are not on track and the system of selection and examination for officials has not yet been established, two common phenomena occur. One is that low-level officials often try to ingratiate themselves with new superiors, or seek promotion, by taking the opportunity to extort money from the people as "tribute." The other is that newly appointed superiors often instruct their subordinates to initiate "tribute," and if things go wrong, the subordinates bear the responsibility. This phenomenon has actually been discovered in our city. Fortunately, the municipal government has taken measures to maintain official discipline and has imposed penalties of dismissal and transfer. Such virtuous measures are naturally worthy of admiration and are truly welcomed by public opinion. At the same time, we feel that the authorities should not wait for the matter to be brought up in public before taking corrective action; rather, they should make it public as soon as possible to inform the public.

We believe that this statement from the municipal government has two major implications. First, in the future, if people encounter similar situations of official misconduct, they will no longer be deceived. We also hope that the authorities will allow citizens to report such incidents at any time. Second, in the future, responsible officials at all levels will be vigilant about their subordinates' actions to avoid damaging their own integrity. In this way, the phenomenon of official misconduct can be eradicated once and for all, and the political track can be established from now on. How fortunate! How fortunate!

### Original Letter of Important Statement from the Municipal Government

To the Editorial Department of Shen Bao:
Regarding the commentary in your newspaper on September 3 concerning bribery by the police precinct chief, the facts have been investigated and found to be untrue. The incident was that a former employee of the precinct, in an attempt to ingratiate himself with his superiors and seize the opportunity to collect money, consulted with a few local residents about raising funds to offer gifts to the precinct chief. The precinct chief never received a single cent. The former employee was subsequently dismissed. However, due to the precinct chief's failure to report the matter to the municipal government beforehand, a punishment of dismissal was imposed to maintain official discipline. This penalty is considered excessive in light of normal circumstances. Your newspaper's hasty criticism, without thorough investigation, initially deviated from the facts. While public opinion is pleased to hear such reports, it is essential to base arguments on facts. We hope that in the future, if your newspaper has any unclear facts, it will conduct interviews before making comments so as not to betray the great reputation your newspaper has enjoyed for decades, as well as the power of public opinion. We also hope that you will publish this letter in your newspaper to dispel doubts and clarify the truth.
With best wishes,
Secretariat of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government

### Inspection Mission Completed, Minister Aoki of Japan Returns Home, Visit to China and Manchuria of Great Significance

Tokyo, September 5 (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 5:30 PM: Minister Aoki of Japan's Greater East Asia Ministry recently visited the Republic of China and Manchukuo, and having completed his mission, arrived in Fukuoka at 5:30 PM on the afternoon of the 5th.

Fengtian, September 5 (Central News Agency) - Minister Aoki of Japan's Greater East Asia Ministry issued a statement upon leaving Manchuria, the gist of which is as follows: I have long desired to visit Manchukuo to express my gratitude for the enormous contributions it has made since the Greater East Asia War, to hold earnest talks with key figures in Manchukuo, and to personally observe the conditions of various local institutions. I am deeply gratified to have been able to fulfill these wishes this time. The construction of Manchukuo in the past ten years is truly astonishing to the world, and while Japan has taken up arms to free the nations of Asia from the shackles of the United States and Britain, Manchukuo has also devoted all its efforts to actively cooperate. In addition to guarding the northern border, it has also provided iron, food, and other extremely important resources and materials to support the war effort. All of these contributions are enormous and deeply appreciated. Furthermore, I was deeply moved by the strict training and security conditions of the Kwantung Army, which bears the heavy responsibility of guarding the important northern border. Before visiting Manchukuo, I first visited the Republic of China, where I witnessed the current state of affairs, with China steadily improving its construction policies and cooperating with Japan to live and die together in the Greater East Asia War. Now, I have also witnessed the flourishing development of Manchukuo and its determination to strengthen the unity between Japan and Manchukuo, which has further strengthened my belief in the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War.

Satisfied with the Progress of Policies towards China

Tokyo, September 5 (Central News Agency) - According to political observers here: Minister Aoki of Japan's Greater East Asia Ministry completed his mission to visit the Republic of China and Manchukuo and returned to Japan on the 5th. It is remembered that Minister Aoki visited Thailand, Vietnam, and other southern regions in April of this year, and now he has also visited China and Manchukuo, which shows that the enemy's propaganda is worthless. Especially at a time when China is developing steadily from an East Asian perspective, its significance is even more profound. Minister Aoki's visit to China was to inspect in detail the actual situation in China after Japan implemented its new policies, and to hold earnest talks with Chinese government officials on concrete ways to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation, with the development of Chinese affairs as the background. In this regard, he was able to contact the realities of various regions of China and to personally inspect the concrete situation of the implementation of new policies by the Japanese side. Therefore, it goes without saying that the result is a more optimistic view of the promotion of new policies. At the same time, based on the actual situation, a clear direction was also obtained regarding future policies towards China and concrete measures for Sino-Japanese cooperation. Moreover, during Minister Aoki's visit to China, he met with President Wang of the National Government for earnest talks, and held frank and open discussions with Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, and Zhou Fohai, Minister of Finance of the National Government, Zhu Minyi, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Mei Siping, Minister of Industry, and greatly achieved the purpose of communicating the intentions of China and Japan. Secondly, in Shanghai, he also held earnest talks with Chinese and Japanese political figures. In the political field, such as the fundamental revision of the basic treaty between China and Japan, and in other fields, such as the concrete expression of measures for materials and prices, the promotion of current problems has had a profound impact and is worthy of attention. Minister Aoki's visit to China and Manchukuo is most worthy of showing to the world that China, Japan, and Manchukuo have formed the core of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the fact that they are cooperating on the same front to implement the Greater East Asia War, and that the strategies for future cooperation between the three countries will become more concrete, and the significance of this visit is extremely significant.

### War Results of Japanese Army in Shandong, Clearance in Eastern Tai'an and Other Places

Jinan, September 5 (Central News Agency) - The war situation of the elite Japanese army against the remaining troops of the Chongqing Communist forces in central Shandong is as follows: The Japanese army's expeditionary force began its operations on August 18th. On the 20th, it learned that more than 100 bandits from Wang Jizhen's unit were lurking in the Xingcun Zhangjin (26 kilometers east of Changqiu) area, and immediately launched a fierce attack on them. In about an hour of battle, it killed 40 enemies, captured 48 enemies, and seized 44 rifles. Subsequently, in Zhang'erzhuang (14 kilometers northeast of Zhangqiu) and Liguanzhuang (18 kilometers northeast of Licheng County), it suppressed about 800 bandits from Yue Bofen's unit, the 13th Brigade of the Shandong Security Forces of Chongqing, killing 35 enemies, capturing 359 enemies, and seizing one mortar, one light machine gun, 113 rifles, 1,342 rounds of ammunition, and 209 hand grenades, achieving great war results. Another unit of the Japanese army attacked about 180 Communist bandits near Zhaozhuang (15 kilometers north of Wucheng County) and Beilinzhuang (about 5 miles west of Zhaozhuang) on August 18th and 19th. As a result, 40 enemies were killed, 10 enemies were captured, and 31 rifles were seized. Another unit of the Japanese army launched a punitive war in the eastern area of Tai'an County from August 20th. By dawn on the 22nd, it advanced to Shenghuan (about 25 kilometers east of Tai'an County) and suppressed about 300 bandits from the 1st Military Sub-district of the Communist Army, annihilating them all and seizing 40 rifles, 2 light machine guns, and 2 pistols. On August 26th, in the Taipingzhuang area in the southeast of Tai'an County, it suppressed a unit of the Communist Army (the 10th Regiment, led by Regiment Commander Chen Ming). After about half an hour of battle, the enemy was defeated and fled, abandoning 15 corpses, with more than 10 captured, and 17 rifles seized.

### Minister Zhou Returns to Beijing

Nanjing, September 5 (Central News Agency) - Zhou Fohai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, went to Shanghai on the 26th for official business. He has now completed his work and returned to Beijing by plane on the afternoon of the 5th.

### American Planes Attack Guangzhou, Two Shot Down

Guangzhou, September 5 (Central News Agency) - Although the US-Chongqing Air Force has suffered heavy losses, it is still desperately trying to counterattack. At 3:10 PM on the 4th, it again came to the Guangzhou area with 13 (P/40) aircraft and 9 (P/25) aircraft. After the Japanese Army Air Force took off to intercept, two of them were confirmed to have been shot down. It is also said that although the general public is extremely reliant on the Japanese Air Force due to the repeated attacks by the American Air Force

### Gibraltar Situation

Madrid, September 5 (Central News Agency) - According to news from Larini: A submarine attack occurred near Gibraltar yesterday morning. Gibraltar issued a submarine alert and immediately opened fire, using depth charges. It was also learned that there are currently about 50 merchant ships in the port of Algeciras, 20 of which are a convoy that arrived from the Atlantic Ocean yesterday morning. There are currently two destroyers and one merchant ship being repaired in the harbor. Currently docked in Gibraltar are one American battleship of the Texas class, three aircraft carriers, three cruisers, and sixteen British destroyers.

### British Troops Land in Southern Italy, Establish Bridgehead, Seeking Passages to Advance Inland

Rome, September 5 (Central News Agency) - The Overseas News Agency reported that the Italian army announced yesterday that British troops have established a bridgehead in Calabria and are seeking passages to enter the interior. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces' occupation of Reggio is to protect their flanks. However, the most important locations are San Giovanni and Sals, because they are located in the northwest corner of the Strait of Messina. If these locations are occupied, the anti-Axis forces will often gain two passages to enter the interior. The bridgehead established by the British troops allows them to advance from the east and southeast, but the use of tanks will be greatly limited.

Berlin, September 5 (Central News Agency)

German News Agency: The anti-Axis countries' repeated attempts to land in Reggio have been repelled by the German army. There are still battles occurring in the area, but the Axis forces do not expect to have major battles here, as the mountainous terrain is sufficient to prevent the movement of motorized troops. The traffic in Calabria is very unfavorable, and the better roads are only along the coast. The US army is now abandoning the British army to difficult circumstances. Because the US army suffered too much damage in Sicily, it will still not participate in the landing operation, or General Eisenhower may want his troops to land in another place, it is not yet known. The ships concentrated in Bizerte and Tunis may be reserved for the US army and French rebels to use for landing.

### British Planes Raid Berlin at Night, Dropping a Thousand Tons of Bombs

Berlin, September 5 (Central News Agency) - The German headquarters announced on the 4th that British Air Force bomber formations attacked the Berlin area on the night of the 3rd, dropping a large number of incendiary bombs and bombs. Some parts of the city suffered considerable damage, and some people were killed and injured. The German air defense forces shot down 27 British aircraft.

Lisbon, September 5 (Central News Agency) - According to a London dispatch: The British Air Force bombed Berlin on the night of the 3rd, dropping ten tons of bombs in just twenty minutes. When the British Air Force announced this on the 4th, it stated that a total of two bombers were lost.

Oshima Inspects Hamburg Bombing Area

Berlin, September 5 (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Lieutenant General Oshima, went to Hamburg on the 4th to inspect the situation after the blind bombing by the anti-Axis air force, as well as other defense conditions.

### Former Italian Foreign Minister Ciano Arrested

Rome, September 5 (Central News Agency) - Former Italian Foreign Minister Ciano disappeared from his villa in Rome last week and was discovered and arrested by the police on Friday and is now under strict guard. The authorities learned of Ciano's whereabouts from someone who gave Ciano some subtle task, and that person has been arrested and interrogated severely. But the arrest of Ciano was extremely difficult because he was sheltered by foreigners who had obtained diplomatic privileges, but this difficulty was overcome. Ciano was arrested when he left his hiding place, and it is rumored that his wife was also arrested at the same time, but this has not been confirmed. It is still not possible to determine how he escaped police surveillance and left his villa in Rome.

### Preparations Completed for Three-Nation Foreign Ministers' Meeting, Rumor that Roosevelt and Churchill May Go to the Soviet Union

Berlin, September 5 (Central Planning) - The plan for the meeting of the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union has now been completed, but further exchanges of views in the telegram are now underway, as there are still several issues to be discussed. The question of the three Baltic states is one example. Also, the actions of the Czech President in London to sign a treaty with the Soviet Union are unwelcome to Britain and the United States

Lisbon, September 5 (Central News Agency) - Radio broadcasts claim that President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill will go to Moscow because Stalin now bears a great responsibility and cannot leave the country.

### German and Soviet Forces Fight Fiercely for Stalingrad, Soviet Reserve Troops Concentrated to the South

Stockholm, September 5 (Central News Agency) - According to news from the Eastern Front received here: The Soviet forces' operational goal in the Donbas region is to recapture the heavy industrial center of Stalingrad, bypassing it to the north via Taganrog to cut off the railway to Mariupol. Fierce battles have been fought between German and Soviet forces for control of the transportation lines northeast of Stalingrad since the night of the 3rd. As of the 4th, the main battle line extended southward from Nikitovka, 50 kilometers north of Stalingrad, eastward through Garlovka, and from Twarzewo to Kutshelenikowo. According to the Soviet Information Bureau's announcement on the 4th, the Soviet forces at Kutshelenikowo reached Elovaisk, 30 kilometers east of Stalingrad, and then turned westward, directly attacking Stalingrad. However, this has not been confirmed by the Axis side. The Soviet forces north of Stalingrad attempted to advance westward through Nikitovka and Garlovka to attack Krasnoarmeyskoye, attempting to cut off the retreat route of the German forces in the Donbas region. However, the German forces fiercely counterattacked, and the two armies launched a war of attrition with mechanized units. Although the German forces are doing their best to prevent the Soviet forces from advancing, the battle situation is still serious.

### Anglo-American Sacrifice of Small Countries, Anti-Axis Countries Launch Secession Movement

The anti-Axis front, led by Britain and the United States, includes a total of 33 entities, including small countries and governments-in-exile. These small countries are not only disregarded by Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and others, but also become sacrifices for Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to carry out their wars and are used by them, so they are extremely resentful of Britain and the United States.

In the Quebec Conference, the small countries were completely ignored, so the anti-Axis countries in Europe and Central and South America are quite uneasy about their future.

War Aims Not Consistent
Although the agenda of the Quebec Conference is said to have included discussions on the relationship between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and small countries during the war and in the future, as well as the reaffirmation of the Atlantic Charter, the words and deeds of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union do not take into account the sovereignty of small countries, and only consider how to sacrifice small countries to adjust the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union; and how to deal with European problems during and after the war. The anti-Axis United Nations, as claimed by Britain and the United States, have completely inconsistent war aims, so their combination is extremely fragile.

Governments-in-Exile Actually Claim Alliance

The so-called anti-Axis United Nations include the United States, Britain (including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the South African Federation), the Soviet Union, Chongqing, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Cuba, Costa Rica, Iraq, Nicaragua, the Netherlands, Panama, Mexico, Belgium, Greece, Peru, Egypt, Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile, Norway, Colombia, Venezuela, Iran, Ecuador, Abyssinia, Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Luxembourg, etc. Among these 33 countries, in addition to Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, not only are they weak and powerless countries, but also such countries as the Netherlands, Greece, Belgium, Norway, Yugoslavia, Luxembourg, Poland, and Czechoslovakia are governments-in-exile without a country, and Britain actually calls them allies, which is ridiculous. Roosevelt and Churchill use the Atlantic Charter as the political, ideological, and moral foundation of the anti-Axis countries to preserve the independence of small countries, which is completely a blank check. Churchill replied to a member of the British House of Commons on July 14, "The Atlantic Charter is not a treaty, so its amendment does not need to be negotiated with each government." It can be seen that the Atlantic Charter does not have any binding force, and Britain itself has no responsibility.

Norwegian Leader Publishes Book to Expose

British Deputy Prime Minister Attlee also openly declared in the House of Commons on July 18 that it is necessary to cede territory to ensure the safety of anti-Axis countries. Dr. Hans Böro, the leader of the Norwegian government-in-exile, expressed the most anger about the Anglo-American policy of obliterating small countries. In his recent book "The Road to Victory," he attacked the Anglo-American deceitful policies as follows:

"The United States and Britain pretend to hope to restore the sovereignty of small countries and respect their political rights, but small countries cannot do anything without the recognition of the United States and Britain. The Anglo-American imperialists completely disregard small countries and arbitrarily divide the world, and put pressure on governments. Therefore, the small countries of Europe are like meat on a chopping board, at the mercy of Britain and the United States."

He further listed examples of how Norway was sacrificed for Britain and the United States, so the British government banned the sale of the book. The death of Polish government-in-exile Prime Minister Sikorski and his daughter's entourage in a plane crash near Gibraltar on July 5 is unknown. The tragic death of the people truthfully illustrates the fate of small countries. The feelings of the small countries in Central and South America are exactly the same. A few days ago, the Colombian Foreign Minister proposed to Venezuela, Paraguay, Ecuador, Chile, and other countries to immediately convene a joint Latin American conference, and it is necessary to clarify their positions and unite today on the issues of upholding sovereignty and the issues that will arise after the war. The Anglo-American imperialists' aggression against the sovereignty of small countries is openly expressed in their recent policies towards neutral countries. The United States used all means such as bribery, purchase, conspiracy, intimidation, and oppression to make all Latin American countries except Argentina return to the anti-Axis camp. Due to these various examples, the small countries have thoroughly recognized the ambitions of Anglo-American imperialism and are only trying to escape their clutches and engage in the defense of their sovereignty and territory.

The National Commercial Control Association's office for the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth has been ordered to handle the purchase of yarn and cloth and the supplementary registration of yarn and cloth. Since the start of the announcement, the owners or occupants of yarn and cloth in the Shanghai area have filled out sales application forms and sales summary tables and supplementary registration forms, and the yarn and cloth retailers and manufacturers or occupants have enthusiastically obtained and submitted the forms to the office. Because the deadline is today (6th), the office was open as usual yesterday (5th), even though it was a public holiday, to accept applications as much as possible. The Central News Agency reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the office yesterday, and was told that because there are many people in the city holding yarn and cloth, the time for those who apply for sale or supplementary registration in accordance with the law may not be enough. Therefore, the acceptance of applications will be extended until 12:00 PM today (6th). After this time, they will be confiscated and punished according to the law. The city's cloth industry association, cloth factory industry association, and yarn factory joint association have already filled out the sales application forms for all their members and forwarded them to the office. There are still retailers or occupants whose yarn and cloth can be filled out and submitted to the office for sale tonight. The price of each yarn and cloth merchant's sales of yarn and cloth is being determined by the Sino-Japanese Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth Quality Price Determination Committee, which is jointly established by the office and the Japanese Cotton Cloth Management Affairs Bureau. The committee is divided into cotton yarn department, white blank cotton cloth department, and processed cotton cloth department, and has been holding small group meetings to study and determine the price. It is expected that the price will be determined within four days, and after being reviewed and determined by the National Commercial Control Association and the Japanese Embassy, it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation, and will be purchased and put into storage. The types of yarn and cloth to be purchased are listed as follows.

The validity period for Anqing was previously set at two weeks, and it is now extended to one month.

### Fushimi Naval Captain Dies for His Country: Remarks by Colonel Matsushima

Central News Agency dispatch. The Japanese Ministry of the Navy announced on the 4th that Count Hiroyasu Fushimi, a captain in the Japanese Navy, bravely died for his country in the southwestern Pacific in late August. Colonel Matsushima, head of the press department of the Japanese Fleet in China, made the following statement on the 5th: "It is with utmost grief that I report that Naval Captain Count Hiroyasu Fushimi engaged in combat with enemy aircraft in the southwestern Pacific, was unfortunately wounded, and died. Although Count Hiroyasu came from a noble family, he still led by example, entering and exiting fierce battlefields filled with smoke and fire, setting a model for soldiers. Not only naval officers and soldiers, but all 100 million compatriots are deeply moved. I was a classmate at the Naval Academy with Count Hiroyasu's elder brother, Prince Hiroyoshi Fushimi, and under the strict education of their father, Prince Fushimi, the entire family devoted themselves to the Imperial Navy, for which I am deeply grateful. Since the death of Prince Hiroyoshi, all classmates have expressed deep sorrow. Although I did not directly serve closely with Count Hiroyasu, in Showa 9 (1934), when Count Hiroyasu departed on a long-distance voyage, I happened to be in the Naval Military Education Department, engaged in film production. On that day, due to filming a scene in 'The Great Japanese Maritime Nation,' I had the opportunity to film his departure. Our connection was predestined. Also, when he served in the Naval General Staff, I often went to the General Staff for other business and always saw the Count diligently performing his duties. I can still recall it to this day. This time, his unfortunate and heroic death, and thinking again of the death of Prince Hiroyoshi, evokes only overwhelming emotion and grief. In addition to expressing heartfelt condolences with our 100 million compatriots, we will also strengthen our determination to win the decisive battle."

### First Police Precinct Establishes Police Defense Section

The First Police Bureau of the Shanghai Special Municipality originally had an Air Defense and Traffic Section, which directly reported to the Administrative Section, guiding and handling civil air defense matters. Recognizing the importance of civil air defense, it has now been reorganized and expanded to establish a Medical Defense Section. The section is further divided into two sub-sections: Police Defense and Air Defense. The head of the Police Defense Section is concurrently held by Matsumoto, the head of the General Affairs Section. The head of the Police Affairs Section is concurrently held by Tsukazaki, the commander of the Police Corps. The head of the Air Defense Section is specifically held by Okawa, the chief of the Central Sub-bureau. Previously, the First Police Bureau had six sections: General Affairs, Inspection, Special Police, Judicial Affairs, Baojia (Household Registry), and now with the addition of the Police Defense Section, there are a total of seven sections.

### Second Batch of Coal Bricks for Cooked Water Sold Starting the 9th

The second batch of coal bricks for cooked water stores, co-organized by the coal industry association, is scheduled to begin sales on the 9th, lasting for five days until 12:00 noon on the 13th. The coal bricks supplied this time are a type of bituminous coal, with a limit of six *jin* per household, totaling 420 tons. The management of Yitai Xing, Junchang, Sun Bo Yuan, Tongcheng, and Dachang five coal companies is still entrusted with the sales. At that time, each registered cooked water store must have the store owner personally bring the store name, address, and name stamp to the Cooked Water Industry Association to apply for certification, then take the certificate to the Coal Industry Association for endorsement before paying the above coal companies to pick up the goods. However, it is still limited to the coal bricks for cooked water stores in the First and Eighth Districts, Nanshi, Huxi, and north of the Suzhou River. The supply for these areas will be temporarily delayed and managed by the Hongkou Coal Small Merchant Association. The Cooked Water Industry Association is currently negotiating with the association in good faith and hopes to achieve satisfactory results.

National Forum

### Some Opinions on the School Authorities

— Zhuo Rong

In its commentary on the 25th of last month, Shen Bao described the crisis in Shanghai education and, in order to eliminate this crisis, advocated starting with actively improving the treatment of faculty and staff. On the other hand, it forcibly ordered students to practice ethics. (This crisis and the solution should be valued by dedicated educators, especially the education authorities. The author only considers the student's position and raises some points that are currently or generally neglected in the educational implementation of most universities and middle schools for reference.) Hopefully, in the cry to eliminate the crisis in education, all levels can work together to reverse the situation.

Develop Students' Group Life

The purpose of school education is not only to impart knowledge and skills, but more importantly, to cultivate healthy citizens both physically and mentally. However, most schools in Shanghai have now become institutions that only impart knowledge, neglecting the responsibility of moral education for students, and even ignoring students' extracurricular activities, allowing them to develop freely. This kind of deformed phenomenon should be corrected. Originally, the most valuable aspect of school education lies in allowing students to genuinely enjoy the training of group life. (Because only under the proper atmosphere of group life can young people's enthusiasm, vigorous energy, and ability to handle affairs be reasonably and fully developed, and the spirit of patriotism, discipline, and enthusiastic service can be cultivated.) But judging from the current situation, students come to school, sit in the classroom for a few hours, and after class, everyone disperses and does their own thing. Some student groups within the school are either abolished or exist in name only. Looking at it this way, the relationship between classmates is like a plate of loose sand, lacking a spirit of unity, not to mention the gap between teachers and students. Even among classmates in the same department and grade, there are those who do not know each other due to a lack of opportunities for contact. This situation is very common in schools that implement the credit system, because each person's selected subjects are not entirely the same, and sometimes the same subject is taught in different classes. Students have few opportunities to contact and communicate with each other, so it is difficult for them to understand each other. The so-called sincere and mutual exchange of feelings is even more out of the question. I dare to say boldly that the above-mentioned characteristics of group life have no special effect in such circumstances. Because of this, ugly incidents of students engaging in brawls due to temporary emotional excitement have occurred. These kinds of incidents sufficiently prove that students have not been influenced by group life, but the school authorities' lack of leadership cannot escape blame. Therefore, I feel that in order to revive the honest and earnest academic atmosphere, it is necessary to rectify all student groups within the school, so that they can exert their original functions, connect all students, and work together in the three aspects of knowledge, morality, and physical education. Only after the relationship between students is close can the relationship between teachers and students be integrated. In this way, we can eliminate the students' selfish attitude and the extreme development of individualism, and at the same time prevent them from developing a atmosphere of autonomous learning.

Generally, people believe that the current students' level has declined, and that students are not diligent, lazy, and indolent. This is a partial fact and cannot be denied. Because some commercial schools excessively loosen students' homework. However, some schools overcorrect, implementing crammed education, regardless of students' abilities and energy, and specializing in adopting deeper textbooks to praise themselves. I feel that the fact that students are mentally distracted and do not concentrate on learning is due to the lack of an atmosphere in the school that encourages them to work hard and study medicine, which is a very important reason. The formation of this reason is multifaceted. It is known that the temptation of material life outside, the difficulty of finding a suitable job after graduation, the frustrating environment, etc., are all factors. But we must not ignore the lack of action by the school authorities to encourage students to make continuous progress. This can be seen from the fact that the school authorities have canceled various academic competitions and stopped holding research conferences, discussion groups, and lecture halls. It cannot be denied that the desire to win is inherent in everyone. A student's academic entanglement is easily motivated by glory. If the school authorities can grasp the students' psychology and make good use of it, even the students who have always been diligent will become more diligent. Their spirit of learning will not be difficult to influence other students. Therefore, young people who are capable and self-loving can put effort into learning. They will not have extra time and energy to spend outside the school, indulging in singing and dancing. Rectifying the academic atmosphere may not be able to achieve some effect in this area.

### First District Public Office Puts All Efforts into Planning Grain Administration

Statement by Chief Secretary Wu Songfu

Wu Songfu, the chief secretary of the First District Public Office, declared when interviewed by reporters yesterday: "In order to solve the problems caused by the current reduction in the amount of household rice allocated, it is necessary not only for the Chinese and Japanese authorities to cooperate, but also for the public to sincerely understand and help each other, and jointly support the work of this allocation." According to Mr. Wu, after the takeover of the concessions, various inevitable problems have arisen one after another. With the cooperation of the new staff in various departments of the First District Public Office, the current situation is being improved. The differences in salaries between Chinese and foreign staff have been corrected. In the future, salaries will be determined based on talent, regardless of nationality. The most important task currently considered by officials of the First District Public Office is to ensure that the residents of this city have enough household rice for daily use each month. The authorities need to understand that whether or not the food problem is solved is deeply related to the economic situation of this city. Mr. Wu said that all levels of staff have devoted most of their time to solving the problem, and he believes that satisfactory and concrete solutions will be implemented soon. Mr. Wu said that the satisfactory solution of the rice problem is undoubtedly a great benefit to all people in Shanghai. At the same time, he revealed that since August 1st, all official documents and letters used by the First District Public Office have been changed to Chinese. Mr. Wu also said that the salaries of the staff used in the District Public Office, especially those with lower salaries, have been considered for an increase.

### Banks and Money Shops Encourage Savings Deposits, Guiding Idle Capital into the Right Track

Banks and money shops, noting the significant decline in fixed deposits in recent years, especially savings deposits, have taken action. Savings in banks are immediately withdrawn upon maturity, and new bank savings are mostly close to zero. As a result, some banks no longer have savings departments, or they exist in name only. In order to protect the interests of depositors, the Ministry of Finance has ordered banks to pay deposit reserves and revised the Savings Bank Law. Ordinary banks engaged in savings business must have a minimum capital of 5 million yuan. The total capital of savings banks must be at least 6 million yuan. In addition to complying with these regulations, banks are also striving to promote the virtues of saving and guiding idle capital into the right track. They have increased interest rates on savings deposits, especially focusing on

Fixed deposits. It is heard that those with a one-year term have been raised to more than 8% annual interest, while long-term deposits of more than one year have been raised to more than 10%, and demand deposits have been raised to more than 5%. In addition, they are promoting thrift savings programs, designating a week starting on the 8th of each month as a thrift savings week. Each bank extends office hours by one hour to specifically accept thrift savings deposits, with interest rates higher than ordinary deposits. At the same time, they are particularly cautious in the use of funds, and operate entirely in accordance with government laws and regulations to encourage savings.

### Sales of Miscellaneous Grains are Booming, Illegal Trading is Strictly Prohibited

Since the household rice supply in this city has had some setbacks, the general public has been adding miscellaneous grains to their diet, resulting in a surge in the main routes of various miscellaneous grains, making them an essential food for residents. Each business has placed them separately at the entrance for consumers to choose at will. Due to the booming sales, holders of goods have raised prices, hoping to obtain greater profits. This point requires attention from the authorities, who should take measures to stop it in order to lighten the burden on the common people.

It was learned from miscellaneous grain industry sources yesterday that the supply of various miscellaneous grains is currently still booming, mostly coming from major towns along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. Because local farmers plant both rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains as major products, the annual production is considerable. Currently, they are being transported here by water and land, with the number of arriving tons varying daily, but estimated to average around 50 tons, which is essential for the food of the people of this city.

As for miscellaneous grain reserves, they are still abundant. Although sales have increased, the supply is also smooth, and arrival and sales are balanced. According to old buyers who are familiar with the miscellaneous grain market, the recent reserves of miscellaneous grains include more bran, red sorghum, and peas, followed by corn and wheat, and generally less red soybeans. However, new corn has already entered the market, and farmers in various producing areas are organizing it for shipment to Shanghai in batches for sale. However, the Miscellaneous Grain Association strictly prohibits transactions in the market in order to eliminate illegal trading.

### Shanghai Market Conditions Last Week

The various bureaus in this city, in view of the frequent soaring prices, which not only increase the burden on citizens but also affect social security, have adopted drastic measures to thoroughly investigate and deal with the situation according to the law, taking all possible measures. Speculators and merchants are all threatened, and the evil practice of hoarding and speculation has gradually disappeared. Various goods have depreciated and are being sold at a loss. The market conditions for each sector last week are explored below:

Government Bonds

Unified Public Bonds Market Situation

The market situation is hovering, with numerous rumors causing unease. Holders of goods are eager to sell at the price, but few are inquiring. The market situation during the week has not been of much help.

Rice

The arrival of goods in the previous few days was

Prosperous, with 500 to 1,000 bags arriving daily by boat and car. However, sales have also increased sharply, resulting in a slight increase in market prices. On Thursday, due to continuous heavy rain, both arrival and sales decreased, resulting in a slight drop in market prices.

Daily Necessities

Due to rumors of a rationing system

To be implemented soon, people are uncertain, and buyers are hesitant. At the beginning of the week, matches were tired but firm, while soap was ignored, and candles were even more unpredictable. The entire market situation was still constant, until Thursday, when rain limited the arrival of goods and sales declined. Overall, the entire week was volatile.

Ornaments

The listed price is still 5,000 yuan

, plus a handling fee, but there are no goods on the market, and the industry is declining and depressed.

Chinese Stocks

The entire week was unusually scattered,

The owners of goods were quite embarrassed, and there was a slight turnaround on Friday. The entire day's trading gradually became lively. As for the market conditions of other industries, there were no drastic changes.

### Firmly Establish the Belief in Certain Victory; Shatter the Propaganda Strategies of Britain and America; Understand the Foundation of the Greater East Asia War as Unbeatable

Lieutenant Tanaka, Deputy Spokesman of the Japanese Naval Press Department, recently provided a thorough response to questions posed by this newspaper's reporter, strongly urging that people not be misled by the ideological and strategic warfare of the enemy countries, Britain and America. His analysis was extremely insightful, and his original words are as follows:

As the saying goes: "A plan must be secret, and its execution must be swift." Or, as another saying goes: "Like a virgin at rest, like a rabbit in flight." What is the true meaning behind these sayings? We will leave that for another discussion. In short, when undertaking a matter, a hesitant and looking-around attitude is not favored by great generals of the past. We are fundamentally different from our enemy countries, Britain and America. We are currently engaged in a fierce battle in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It goes without saying that the Greater East Asia War was initiated only after careful planning and a firm belief in victory. Only Japan fights with the confidence that it will win. Therefore, there is absolutely no need to worry about changes in the war situation or shifts in the international landscape. We simply need to move toward our intended goal, forcing Britain and America to beg for peace. The recent Quebec Conference held by Britain and America and their active promotion of strategic propaganda are shallow attempts to create joy and sorrow. This is not only an attitude we should not adopt, but such timidity will ultimately prevent the completion of the great task of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In other words, to achieve victory, leaders must remain calm, and the people must diligently and bravely work towards the goal. Even if Britain and America were to gather a large fleet to attack Tokyo, we only need to maintain the resolve of Hojo Tokimune: "Even against ten million enemies, I will persevere," and that will be enough.

We Should Deeply Understand the Unbeatable Situation

The national crisis we are currently facing in the Greater East Asia War is far beyond comparison in scale to any previous national crisis, but in terms of the danger of the crisis, it is lighter than in the past. Why do I say this? Because, quantitatively, the Japanese army and navy are capable of matching the British and American armies and navies. In terms of economic power, we are also capable of competing with Britain and America. Our ancestors, with ten percent of the power against the enemy's infinite power, were still able to overcome national crises and achieve victory. How much more so now, when we have ten percent of the power against ten percent of the enemy's power, is there any reason not to win? However, we must now clearly recognize that Japan has established an unbeatable position and hold the resolve to face the world alone.

By reading the Imperial Rescript declaring war on Britain and America, issued on December 8th of the year before last, it is clear that Japan, in order to eliminate all economic and military threats and seek stability in East Asia, and for the sake of self-preservation and self-defense, resolutely rose up, seeking to resolve the issues independently from beginning to end.

Of course, we already had a sure calculation of victory before we rose up. The battle taking place on the stage of the Pacific Ocean is unprecedented in scale, so naturally, we cannot be swayed by joy or sorrow over minor gains or losses. If you open and browse a world map, it is immediately clear that Japan has already firmly established an unbeatable position. Even if enemy planes attack, or we lose certain occupied territories, there is no need to worry. Moreover, during wartime, enemy planes attacking our occupied territories is a common occurrence in military affairs. In the six months since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the century-old influence of Britain and America in East Asia has been completely eliminated. Yet, are they not still boasting about reclaiming their lost territories? The number of enemy air raids we are currently suffering, compared to the damage suffered by Britain and America, is truly incomparable.

America is again boasting about confronting Japan with its production power, which is precisely a method that benefits our side. America's production power has been gradually decreasing since this year. Conversely, Japan's production power has been making rapid progress since this year. Therefore, the situation is exactly the opposite for us. Whether in terms of production warfare or long-term warfare, it is all advantageous to Japan. If America uses tactics to disrupt trade, this will also benefit Japan. Enemy submarines will only be destroyed by Japanese destroyers. The same is true for aircraft. Therefore, there are no unfavorable signs on the battle lines. Japan has already established an unshakeable position of certain victory in both economic and military strength. The driving force behind establishing this position of certain victory is naturally the vigorous and active actions of the Japanese Navy, such as the brave battles of the defense forces on Guadalcanal Island, and the fierce fighting of the defense forces on Attu Island and Kiska Island. The enemy is unaware of our country's efforts in the political and economic construction of Greater East Asia, and is being exploited by Japan's plans for induced operations. They have gathered a large force on Guadalcanal Island and Attu Island, resulting in immense damage. When they promote and brag to their citizens about retaking those places, has Japan not already established an unbeatable position?

Therefore, no matter how the American military counterattacks in the future, we are already in an invincible position. We must have a firm belief in victory. We must fully recognize this situation and not be exploited by the strategic warfare of Britain and America. There is no need to worry at all about the Casablanca Conference, the Quebec Conference, and the situation in Italy. Anyone who does worry has been exploited by the strategic warfare of Britain and America. Therefore, in ideological warfare, we must increasingly elevate our hatred for Britain and America. An American war correspondent once wrote an article discussing how Japan has established an unbeatable position. An excerpt from the original text is as follows:

"After achieving complete victory in the Pacific through large-scale offensives, Japan has become satisfied. The defensive posture in that area, both on land, sea, and air, has been further strengthened. The liberated natives, who have gained freedom, are cooperating with the Japanese army to build this defensive posture. Given time, Japan will build the world's largest nation and place the nations of Asia under its guidance.

The Chinese in Vietnam, the Thai, the Malays, and others are becoming aware that their fate is tied to Japan. For the sake of thorough defense, Japan is strengthening its air force. To counter the same attempts at Allied landings as in the Solomon Islands, the Japanese army is actively strengthening the defense of all strategic locations. According to a certain special correspondent's report, the defense of Corregidor Island in the Philippines is superior to Gibraltar. The current operations of the Japanese Navy are aimed at inflicting great damage when the American army comes to attack in the future, preventing the expansion of large-scale battles in the Pacific, and frustrating American morale.

That kind of American operation is exactly what Japan wants. At the time the American army began operations, the Japanese army had already taken everything into its hands. Even now, the American army is being blocked by the Japanese army's outpost line, and after a year of hard work, they have only retaken an airfield and a few jungle villages."

The above has stated how powerful Japan is, and that even the combined power of Britain and America will be required to defeat Japan. The enemy themselves have already admitted that Japan has an unbeatable position. It is urged that the citizens not underestimate the war against Japan.

Quebec Conference

Recently, Roosevelt and Churchill held the so-called Quebec Conference for the purpose of carrying out the war. After two weeks of discussions, it concluded on the 23rd. This conference was driven by each party wanting to expand their own interests, filled with ambition. The ugly spectacle of so-called "sharing the same bed but dreaming different dreams" and "enemies in the same boat" can be imagined. Roosevelt and Churchill have now held six conferences, whether it be on the Prince of Wales, in Casablanca, or in Quebec. However, none of the outcomes of these conferences have been realized. Therefore, these frequent conferences are not war-planning meetings, but propaganda tactics aimed at the world and the citizens of their own countries. If the outcome of a conference has been decided, there is no need to meet so many times.

Even if the outcome of the conference is to make Japan the "primary target of attack," we should not be surprised. Because we are at war with Britain and America, whether Britain and America pour all their strength into attacking our country or not, there is no need for us to change our attitude.

Britain and America are shouting, "Now we will switch to making Japan our primary enemy and defeat them!" But a year and a half ago, we were already shouting, "Force Britain and America to beg for peace, and hold a grand naval review in New York!"

The so-called Roosevelt-Churchill conferences and the so-called inflammatory propaganda are mostly a kind of propaganda strategy. Even the Chongqing spokesmen, who are imitating Su Qin and Zhang Yi, have expressed dissatisfaction. Recently, Soong Tzu-wen and Soong Mei-ling traveled thousands of miles to the United States and received national-level treatment. Roosevelt even firmly promised to supply planes and gasoline, so they returned to Chongqing in high spirits. However, later, not a single plane or a single gallon of gasoline was seen delivered.

Furthermore, the anti-Axis forces heavily promoted the content of the Quebec Conference in Canada on August 13, but then claimed that they were concealing the content "due to operational reasons" and engaging in various propaganda tactics. In ancient times, there was the saying "actions speak louder than words," and it was also said "it is easier said than done." If Britain and America were truly discussing operations, they would naturally keep it strictly confidential. But from the fact that they have widely publicized the content of the conference to the world, there is no need to attach importance to the Quebec Conference.

To prevent people from noticing the fact that the Soviet Union did not participate in the conference, they spread propaganda saying, "This conference is a conference for waging war against Japan." At the same time, they made the dying Chongqing regime ecstatic, and they also appeased the dissatisfaction of the Soviet Union, using a method of killing two birds with one stone to boost the morale of the exhausted British people and the internally conflicting American people.

On August 27, when Mrs. Roosevelt visited Australia, she said, "If it weren't for me personally, my husband would have come here with me and could have enjoyed the scenery with even more delight." She used the scenery of Australia as a pretext to make a statement, but in fact, she clearly had the same mission as Knox in May to resolve the internal conflicts in Australia.

Also, when Mountbatten was appointed commander of the Southeast Asia Allied Forces, British Naval Minister Knox stated at a press conference, "I know nothing about it. The Navy Department is not under his command either." This fully exposed the internal divisions within the American army and navy.

As mentioned above, our country started the war with the belief in certain victory. Therefore, no matter what strategies or tactics Britain and America take, our military and economic position of certain victory will not only not collapse, but will surpass Britain and America starting this year. What we should pay special attention to now is establishing a belief in certain victory in ideological warfare and elevating our hatred for Britain and America.

First of all, in terms of elevating hatred for the enemy, although people generally speak of shared hatred on the surface, the remnants of British and American influence still dominate their minds and cannot be shaken off. After the Quebec Conference, Roosevelt used "brotherly love" as a mantra in the Canadian Parliament, which was truly a strategic piece of propaganda that deeply won people's hearts. America, a specialist in bragging, monopolized the propaganda of humanitarianism. But the treatment of Japanese Americans and our treatment of Americans are as different as heaven and earth. If there are still people today who are exploited by the propaganda strategies of these inhumane and unjust Britain and America, then they have already failed in ideological terms. Therefore, in order to make our unbeatable position even more complete, we should elevate our hatred for the enemy and not blindly believe in the enemy's strategic and propaganda warfare. The recent Quebec Conference was ultimately a strategic and propaganda tactic of Britain and America. This kind of propaganda is truly difficult to defend against. This tendency is especially pronounced in Shanghai. Therefore, no matter how the enemy schemes, relying on Japan's economic and political power, we will continue to strengthen our path forward, deeply recognize that the Greater East Asia War has an unbeatable foundation, and move toward overcoming the national crisis of the Greater East Asia War.

### One Month of Interception Battles on Rendova Island - The Japanese Navy and Air Force Bravely Attack the Enemy

(From Naval Press Team Member Takeda at a certain base in the South Pacific) The enemy, who boasted greatly that they would completely occupy the Solomon Islands in one week, has now been ashore on Rendova Island for over a month, without achieving any significant success. Our troops in front of the enemy are even more courageous in battle, displaying the wonders of three-dimensional warfare on land, sea, and air, and gradually improving their positions. This is the main reason why the enemy cannot advance a single step. However, the fighting situation of our naval aviation units at the front-line base in the Solomon Islands for this month is truly beyond words to describe its magnificence. The Sea Eagles always maintain an attitude of making the impossible possible when it comes to combat. The enemy, from Rendova Island, crossed Rubiana Island, intending to advance towards our Munda base; on the other hand, they also landed behind Munda, approaching Kolombangara on the opposite shore. The enemy is reinforcing and supplying these landing forces from the air and sea. In response to these landing forces, our air force and navy, in coordination with the land forces, are displaying their specialty of annihilating the enemy. The Sea Eagles, who have been engaged in a month of interception battles on Rendova Island, become more courageous and murderous as the enemy comes. Their illustrious achievements are being written page by page in the history of the Greater East Asia War. In the skies over the Solomon Islands, it is becoming more intense day by day, and the enemy is bombing almost continuously, day and night. At our front-line ○○ base in the Solomon Islands, the warriors of the fighter planes and bombers, surrounding their commanding officer, Father Eagle ○○, are happily discussing the aerial warfare of the month. In this place, from the caring heart that thinks of his beloved subordinates, he speaks of many modern aerial warfare postures. Just listening to them feels supremely magnificent. The skies over the Solomon Islands have now become a battlefield in the skies where the Japanese and Americans are fighting fiercely. Let's take a look at the actual situation from the mouths of the warriors.

Commander of the Air Force, striving to strike the enemy: The enemy, who has consolidated Guadalcanal Island and established a base in Tulagi, can be seen to be gradually advancing. At that time, they were frequently bombing various locations in Munda and Kolombangara with 50 or 100 aircraft. They were saying shamelessly that they would use the experience of capturing Attu Island to capture Munda. Thus, the enemy's main force was advancing. We could see their momentum very clearly. Regarding this point, our army and navy elite had already made preparations and were waiting. Our aviation units, regardless of any sacrifices, flew to Guadalcanal Island to scout the enemy's departure.

But the enemy immediately increased their reinforcements. While looking for opportunities to attack, they also frequently carried out night bombardments of our land positions with cruisers and destroyers. At the end of June, the weather continued to be exceptionally bad. On the 29th, the day before the landing, it rained all day long. Taking advantage of this opportunity, they controlled us by bombing and shelling our front-line bases, and at the same time, sent a large number of transport ships to Rendova at night. After receiving this news, our troops immediately dispatched all aircraft and began bombing the landing sites. But as we expected, the enemy had already deployed heavy artillery positions on Rendova Island. Since June 30th, we have been attacking with all our air force power countless times every day. Although the sacrifices have been very great, we must stop the enemy by doing everything we can to strike them. In reality, the enemy is using this kind of weather to send a large fleet of transport ships continuously. If we carry out attacks, there will definitely be some sacrifices. But regardless of these sacrifices, we attack the landing sites.

That week was extremely difficult. Those guys always had thirty or forty planes circling in the sky no matter when they went. If we attack them with fighter planes, enemy ships would swarm us. A certain Air Force Sergeant Major recounted the story of his first attack:

### A Faded Dream

— Ren Shufang

She took my arm, and the fragrance of twilight wafted from her hair. We walked slowly on this European-style avenue of Jing'an Temple Road, my mind racing, my nerve cells telling me that today was Saturday.

Thinking that tonight was a day to be excited about, I looked at her purple eyelids shimmering under the streetlights, as if I were drinking wine: "Wanzi! Can you accompany me to the dance hall tonight?"

Her eyes lit up for a moment, then she smiled gracefully and slowly lowered her purple eyelids. Someone was blowing a horn on the street corner.

I forgot when, but I staggered home with an excited heart. I took off my shirt stained with dark red lipstick and felt a little dizzy.

The child was already asleep, and Ping was still leaning on the bed waiting. I didn't say a word, fell onto the bed, and went to sleep.

It was when the winter vacation started and I was a new professor at × University. I had just finished class and was about to leave the classroom.

"Mr. Ding, please come with me for a moment."

It was like a string of silver bells with a charming echo. I turned my head and truly it was God's masterpiece. She was wearing a woolen black qipao with a black coat, like a black peony in early spring, with big eyes like black jade.

I remember as I went down the stairs, my heart was about to escape from my throat.

The second time I taught, I saw her wearing a purple dress. Alas, she had transformed into a purple lilac.

For two months, watching her write a series of wrong characters on the blackboard, I followed her after class. I should have gone back to the faculty lounge, but instead, I followed her out of the school gate.

The dishes that Ping made for me, which I used to enjoy, became bland and tasteless. Even her plump little face was losing its color.

The matchmaker has passed. Her grades were terrible, but I didn't care and gave her an 80.

What a happy afternoon it should have been. When I was still in the laboratory, the tea boy brought a note:

"Mr. Ding: Could you please wait for me at the school gate when you finish your experiment! Wanzi."

I immediately felt my heart go crazy, my face flushed, and I looked at my watch. There was still half an hour before class ended. The footsteps of time crawled over my heart second by second, so slow, like enduring a long, cold night. That was so difficult.

Walking to the door, I saw a group of school boys talking and laughing loudly. Finally, she came. She was wearing a light blue robe, white leather shoes, and a blue ribbon fluttering in her hair. Smiling proudly, she walked towards me and said some casual words. Walking out of the school gate side by side, I immediately noticed that those young gentlemen were disappointed and made some beaten-down faces, staring at us blankly. I felt a burst of proud happiness.

The outskirts in April were filled with flourishing flowers. The wheat ears were already growing tall in the rice fields. The calls of cuckoos could be heard everywhere in the countryside. A branch of tender red roses from some villa hung down. Wanzi went up and picked one and pinned it on my lapel. I immediately felt as glorious as a sheep being loved by a lion.

Wanzi loved to talk. From her mouth, which was smeared with dark purple Kiss-proof lipstick, flowed sweet, soft words. She loved middle-aged men's mustaches, how solemn they were wearing dark-colored suits. Anyway, every word she said made my nerves jump with pleasure.

I remember before Ping and I got married, I quite liked Ping's speech, but now I found Ping's speech too gentle and uninteresting, not exciting enough. A man needs to live with a bold and stimulating woman.

For half a year, she took my arm and ran around everywhere. She never asked if I was married, nor did she ever talk about how we would develop our relationship. I gradually became uneasy.

"Wanzi, will you stop loving me!" I felt that I couldn't take it anymore.

"Don't talk nonsense, think about where to go to play tomorrow!" Disappointed and sad, I didn't say a word until we parted. Suddenly, she leaned close to my ear and said:

"I will always love you." Then she kissed me on the cheek and ran away like she was flying, leaving me standing there in stunned surprise. I went home with excited steps, thinking all the way, who says that middle-aged men are failures in love?

The roses withered and summer came. The students were all threatened by the big exams, and their faces showed unnatural expressions. While I was busy grading her homework, Wanzi told me her phone number and told me not to forget to call her during the summer vacation. Sweating and busy for a few days, grading exam papers, Ping prepared thirst-quenching drinks or cold drinks for me every day, afraid that I would get too hot. But I didn't pay attention to these things. My mind was only thinking of Wanzi: Wanzi:

The day after the exam papers were graded, I called Wanzi, but the answer was that there was no such person at all. I made six or seven calls in a row, and the answers were all the same. My heart began to contract, and I spent more than a month living like I was being fried in a pan.

I went to the dance hall every day, using music and alcohol to numb myself. Finally, I met Wanzi and a man wearing a wide bow tie once. When I was drunk, she was more beautiful than before, wearing diamond earrings and white stiletto heels. She saw me and still smiled as before, introducing me, saying:

"Mr. Ding, this is my fiancé. We are getting married in the fall. Please come to our wedding then!" I immediately heard the sound of all the cells in my body collapsing. I don't know when I left the dance hall and went home. I felt the whole earth was spinning!

Thinking of the shame and regret of the past, all came to my heart, and I couldn't help but sob on the sofa.

Ping stroked my hair and sighed:

"Don't think about the past anymore. You should always consider things before doing them in the future."

I looked up at her in surprise. She smiled, so gently.

"Do you think I don't know? Once I saw you walking with that beautiful lady at the company, but I quickly avoided you; I was afraid that meeting face to face would embarrass you." Ping's eyes were also red, and another wave of shame and hatred gripped me.

"Ping, can you forgive your dishonest husband?"

"Of course, dear." I couldn't help but throw myself into Ping's arms like a child and cry loudly.

### The Girl Who Shakes Socks

— Shen Jie

Clack! Clack!... ! Da! Da!... The endless sound of machines, ringing and clamoring from early morning until late at night, without rhythm, without melody, a music that endlessly deprives "people" of their vitality, blurring the meaning of their existence in the world.

Day by day, consuming the spring of their lives, to live, to have the bare minimum of life, selling their health without any reservation: not wholesale, but retail. They are controlled by machines all day long, working like machines. For the sake of the comfortable silk stockings on the feet of gentlemen and ladies, something that fashionable and noble women would absolutely never think of, nor will they ever think of.

The yellowish complexion, having long been eroded of its vitality by hard work; a haggard appearance, soiled clothing, and even more pitifully, they are barefoot all year round, even though they produce so many socks every day. Their slow pace, always as slow as a snail, seems to fear its future. Who will extend a hand of sympathy and assistance to this remnant of life that is despised by others?

From youth to old age, one after another, being ruthlessly ravaged, until they breathe their last breath. The boss, who used to be tormented by work, but now takes revenge on these successors in a cyclical way, by scolding, cursing, and even hitting them fiercely at the slightest pause! But this group of people who are forgotten, do not resist, only sob and pour out the sadness in their hearts. The reason is that life and everything else are cruelly waiting for them, especially some very young girls. Logically, they should be living a happy school life, but their born misfortune has determined their life, as people have decided for them. There is no light of hope, and even a quick smile is reluctant to linger outside their dull and monotonous lives. The only pitiful hope is – please let me make half a dozen more today! Mother hasn't had white rice porridge in a long time.

Clack! Clack!... Da! Da!... Ringing, clamoring, a music without rhythm, without melody! Draining people's vitality, bringing beautiful silk stockings to the noble.

The human world! Is originally a web of conflicting life!

### The Road

— Yu Si

I am a traveler and a mountaineer. I do not love the plains, and I seem unable to sit still for long.

Now, I have truly embarked on the great road. I must climb over myself, ever upward, until the stars are beneath my feet. Yes, looking down upon myself and my star, only thus can I say that I have reached my peak! Walking in the twilight. The road rises in the eroding soil, a lonely little path, malicious, without grass or trees.

My feet hoarsely tread on the stones that crunch mockingly, crushing the stones that make it slippery.

Although my limbs are weak and my spirit feels decadent, there is something within me called "courage," which is the greatest beast, so it overcomes all other beasts, overcomes the deepest pain of mankind.

Often, when I wander alone at night, on a confusing road, my whole will flies alone, and my soul is full of joy: time also runs on nimble feet, and I comfort my heart with ruthless maxims, walking, walking.

Look! Another sea is spread out before me, and I stand in silence for a moment. At this height, the night is cool, clear, and full of starlight.

### Fallen Leaves

— Lang Sha

(Tune: Nan Ge Zi) Alone leaning on the railing, leisurely contemplating the moon, quietly listening to the leaves leaving the branches, empty steps sharing dripping tears, who knows? (Moved to help with school expenses)

### Teacher's Dirge

— Liang Ying

Friend, please don't ask me anymore.

In the chalk dust,

I have lost more than ten years of youthful glory.

"Sacred education,"

This sign on my shoulder,

I already seem exhausted on the journey of life:

Life? Let me tell you:

×××

Get up early. Drink a bowl of thin porridge

Hastily grab the book bag,

Trying to sign in before nine o'clock.

The electric fee... I have to use the spirit of a marathon,

Within thirty minutes, run a long journey of six or seven 'lis'.

The children's innocence, childish...

Makes me forget my suffering and warms my heart;

Again and again, page after page,

Explaining, comparing,

Rousing my spirits,

Using my high-pitched and raspy voice.

Lunch bell!

Alone, heading towards the quiet sports field;

Take out my rich lunch from my arms,

Three large pancakes;

And swallow it down by the corner of the wall

When the children see it,

It's everywhere sound...

Class, after class,

After class, then class again,

Mouth parched, tongue dried, voice hoarse, throat dry, I barely make it through three classes, dragging my tired body, facing the sunset, faltering home, to a home like a pigeon coop, flashing the dark shadows of life... Son’s vegetable-colored face, the children’s shouts and idle voices... The eldest child is twelve years old, and the second is almost of school age; Go to school? They don't have this...

Teach them myself?

I don’t have an extra bit of time and energy left, a dizzy and chaotic mind, more and more dizzy.

Taking advantage of the quiet night,

The children are asleep,

Under the dim five candle power light,

Rousing the remaining spirit,

Correcting the pile... of homework,

The eyes see sparks flying,

The waist and back ache, and yawning comes frequently.

×××

Thirty-three hours a week,

Four hundred and eighty dollars a month.

Think about it, how little you can spend with this.

Rent, coal briquettes, firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce?

The household registration rice is only enough for making soup

The whole family has become as thin as firewood.

Friend, please don't ask me anymore,

Education is sacred,

How could I not know?

Every day I firmly... sacred, sacred!

Continued from the first page

The Enemy Was Startled

Air Force Sergeant, on June 29th, suddenly received information from the Rentba Island area, and immediately issued a mobilization order. I served as the squadron leader of the fighter planes and accompanied the other team... In the bad weather, weaving in and out in between... However, when we arrived at Rentba Island, the weather also improved. Several cargo-laden transport ships near 00 meters, advancing toward the island from the south, either visible or hidden, were being protected by destroyers. Because there was no sign of enemy aircraft in the nearby airspace, we immediately wanted to charge. When we lowered our altitude, my aircraft No. x began to tilt continuously. Perhaps enemy aircraft had appeared, so I turned around and looked, and more than twenty Sikorsky-type aircraft flew in from the right, and more than twenty Grumman-type aircraft charged from the front, so this resulted in a head-on collision. It was an air battle mixed together.

It seems the enemy was startled. We, who were initially at a disadvantage, immediately went from being evenly matched to gaining the upper hand. After that, the battle situation was controlled by us. The enemy deliberately made an attacking pose to escape. We shot down those who attacked and chased those who ran away. In less than twenty-five minutes, the sky was full of... planes. After forty minutes, there was no trace of the enemy planes. This was the result of the battle.

The machine-gun strafing... was a very long air battle. Although it was a difficult battle, it was indeed a joyful result to shoot down thirty-one enemy aircraft.

Air Force Sergeant: On July 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, from sunrise to sunset, the enemy constantly flew forty to fifty aircraft into the sky above Rentba Island. On June 30th, the Sikorsky and Grumman types had suffered losses from us, so from the second onwards, twin-engine P38 and P39 types came. They carried a huge mission to capture and annihilate the enemy fighters. At an altitude of 00 meters, we suddenly penetrated the enemy's airspace. We engaged with the P38 types. Those guys were in teams of two or four. I chased a team of two aircraft, but they began to flee northwest from Rentba. There was a pile of turbulent clouds in front of them. I expected that they would fly into the turbulent clouds and turn around, so I waited for them. As expected, they came out. So I flew close desperately and strafed with machine guns, and the bullets went straight toward the enemy pilot's position and exploded. Then it swayed and fell down. On this day, many P38 type aircraft were shot down. At that time, I thought the enemy was afraid and would not come again. But the next day, a large team of P58 type aircraft came again, intending to challenge us.

Sweeping Ships Day and Night

Commander 00: At that time, the enemy landed on Rice Bay on the Monta side behind us, and the battle line expanded even further. The enemy did not care about the consumption and losses, and always had reinforcements. It was truly a war of effort in rescue. No matter how we eliminated them, their reinforcements always kept coming. So, we were sweeping enemy aircraft and acquiring sea vessels day and night. There was such a thing once.

When we received information that the enemy was landing east of our airfield, our aircraft team immediately departed. We were ordered to attack boats, and if there were no boats, to bomb land points. So we took off. Before long, we received a report saying that the enemy had been repelled in the waves. Because there were no boats, I was worried and wondering, were we going to bomb our own ground troops? But it would be wrong if we did not act according to orders. What should we do? Just as we were helpless, we received an order to return to our original defense, and then we felt relieved.

Lieutenant: How many times have you bombed the enemy?

Surprise Attack Completely Successful

Lieutenant: On the 21st, when we launched a surprise attack on Rentba Port, it was completely successful. Turning over from the south, we counted the enemy destroyers and steamships, one, two, three, but the people below could not detect us. After we were ready, we dove down. Only then did the enemy notice, and they began to shoot in a panic, but it was too late. They were completely our target. It could almost be said that they sank into the seabed without even needing to drop bombs. The destroyer wanted to escape quickly, but it was too late and was sunk. The large transport ship, full of cargo and people, was also directly hit and sank into the seabed. It can truly be said that this day's attack was completely successful.

Commander: Because it is a competition for supplies and reinforcements, a very impressive night battle has recently unfolded on the ocean. The aircraft protecting the fleet also launched an air battle. Lieutenant 00 also shot down a Grumman-type aircraft on the 13th!

Winning a Battle at Dawn Lieutenant: The enemy destroyers and cruisers were sunk in the way we wanted. It was on a night of night battles, near dawn, when we... victoriously completed the battle and were returning home, and we flew to the sky where the naval battle had taken place. In an instant, we saw two destroyers constantly circling a badly damaged warship. To see more clearly, we... lowered our altitude and began to circle. Then, the destroyer below suddenly fired an anti-aircraft gun at us with a "bang"! Ah! We then realized that it was the enemy. However, was this strange ship that was surrounded ours? Upon closer inspection, we realized that the enemy ship had been bombed in half, and only the part from the smokestack forward remained floating on the sea. The two... destroyers wanted to rescue it. The destroyers kept firing. There was really no way in this situation, and it was a pity that we did not have bombs. We had no choice but to fire several rows of machine guns, and then the enemy fighter plane, the Grumman type, came to the rescue. We suddenly switched to air combat and returned after shooting down eleven aircraft. Because... it was a strange ship type. At first, we really didn't understand, it turned out to be half a warship. We had never seen this before.

Let Fellow Aircraft Attack

Lieutenant 00: It was about a week ago. When we were attacking Rentba Island at night and were on our way home, it was very... the weather was very bad. When we came out of the tip... suddenly a black shadow of a ship appeared in front of us. There were several... It was definitely correct. I cherished the opportunity to ambush in my heart. Slowly descending from afar... Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be an enemy cruiser and... a destroyer. It was a pity... we discovered the enemy but had no bombs... Then let the fellow aircraft attack... In the vicinity... Drew a large circle... Slowly... increased the height... Suddenly descended from the clouds... Straffing with machine guns. Up until this point... The enemy fleet thought that we were their own. After the fellow aircraft dropped the bombs and dodged away... The greatly startled enemy... Although they saw that our plane had flown far away... They were still constantly firing... Anti-aircraft guns and heavy artillery... Unyielding and unremitting battle

Commander 00: In short... the enemy has many things... Therefore, in this unyielding and unremitting battle... we also need to unite more sincerely... we must have a firm... determination not to be defeated... The enemy attacked our 00 base continuously, day and night... Large aircraft and small aircraft, large formations of aircraft... used them without rules... If we are not careful even a little bit... we will be taken advantage of immediately... On a bright moonlit night, of course, they will definitely come... No matter how many they shoot down, they still keep flying over. They think that even if they are shot down by us, it is good. This accumulation will also have an effect... We must pay attention to this... These Type 24... (Original missing)... Type 2... B-17 type bombers... came flying under the direct cover of fighter planes, constantly dropping bombs. We were very unhappy about engaging with the enemy in the skies above our own area... Lieutenant 00: Because we didn't know the enemy was coming... So we wanted to... line up the team... Then... it felt a little strange inside the field... There were also people starting to run around... I was thinking that this was really strange! It turned out that the enemy had come to attack... So, we flew into the high sky. Found... Their own aircraft that had already flown from within the airfield... Cooperated to conduct air combat...

Commander 00: At that time, the enemy came with twenty-one large aircraft... and dozens of small aircraft. A large formation of aircraft like this had also come to attack a few days ago, and twenty-three aircraft were shot down. As soon as I issued an air raid warning, I went to the... platform... Everyone united sincerely. A certain commander: The morale of the soldiers and the revitalization of the military's spirit, this is the spirit of the Imperial soldiers, so there is no need to worry. I only hope that everyone will always pay attention to whether everyone is united sincerely. Such things are currently happening... The enemy's fastest aircraft, the P-38 type, came to scout at an unusually high altitude. At that time, there happened to be a newly appointed fighter pilot on patrol in the sky. Not knowing what to do, he only saw the enemy plane trying hard to approach him. There was no hope of escaping, but somehow he shot down the enemy plane. When he landed, all the aviators applauded and congratulated him. Because he was an aviator who was not very familiar with everyone, he was always worried in his heart. But seeing this situation, he became radiant.

When the dive bomber team, which suffered the most damage, departed, all the aviators waved their hats to welcome them. It was truly of one heart and one mind. Sincere unity... Gathering so many people... The most difficult thing is to constantly emphasize this point. If there is an opportunity, immediately come forward to explain. In short, never mind... Like this, everyone is harmonious and strong... There is nothing like this outside Japan. (Translated from Japanese)

### Pan Sansheng Promotes Sports, Organizes the Sansheng Sports Association, Actively Develops Various Men's and Women's Sports

Mr. Pan Sansheng, Director of the Local Exchange Bank, noting that local sports have been declining for various reasons recently, and that sports are a necessary condition for strengthening the nation, has organized the Sansheng Sports Association. He hopes to rally support, so that sports can flourish from now on. The association was officially established in early August this year, with Mr. Pan serving as the president, leading everything. In addition to the original small soccer team, new members were recruited to form a large soccer team, gathering soldiers from Xu... and... The association also organized a tennis team, women's basketball and volleyball teams, and a track and field team. The Sheng... team, a strong four-person soccer team, also came to join the association, changing its name to the Overseas Chinese Vocational Team. The establishment of the association coincided with the National Government's recovery of the Shanghai Concession, when the whole country was celebrating fervently. Therefore, the association organized a football tournament to celebrate the recovery of the concession. Two matches were held at Yihai successively. In the first match, Sansheng won against the Four-Team Alliance, and in the second match, they lost to the Shanghai Navy. At that time, the traffic on Avenue Albert was heavy, and the scene was unprecedentedly grand. The income from the... reached 600,000 yuan, which was distributed to Shen Xin Er Bao as a scholarship to benefit poor students, which was very significant. The expansion of the association is described below.

Football Team Forms Iron Army

Before the establishment of the Sansheng Sports Association, there was already a small soccer team. All the members were young warriors with abundant strength, and they had repeatedly defeated strong teams, gaining a lot of recognition. With the establishment of the Sports Association, all the warriors of Xu... were recruited to form a large soccer team, with Wang Xisheng, Yu Liming, and the Li Hua brothers joining. President Pan aims to discover new talents, regardless of winning or losing, which is deeply in line with the true meaning of promoting sports. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

Large Soccer Team

Yu Lihua, Luo... Fu Gao, Zhang Yuanzhi, Mai... Sen, Xu Deming, Zhi Yang, Lian Jun, Wang Xisheng, Zhou Defa, Wen Zhuang, Wen Quan, Zhou Wenkui, Gu Yiyi, Wang Guoguang, Yu Liming

Small Soccer Team

Chen Houde as Goalkeeper

Tennis Team Wins Twice in Two Battles

Subsequently, a tennis team was established, attracting tennis players such as Li Guofan, Tang Baojia, Yu Tianguang, Liang Deguang, Wang Shuqing, Guo Yujie, Liu Chongben, etc. Veteran Zhang Dingjian also donned his uniform again and played for the team. Mao... from the Shanghai-Hong Kong... also obtained amateur qualifications, changed his name to Tao Guanqiu, and served the team, adding more splendor. They had friendly matches with the Central and Lianming teams twice, defeating their opponents by 7 to 4 and 7 to 2 respectively, gaining fame and reputation. It can be said that they had the appearance of dominating the Chinese tennis scene in Shanghai. In order to promote tennis, the association also initiated and hosted the Shanghai Open Tennis Championship, which has already begun registration and will be unveiled soon. The full list of team members is as follows:

Tao Guanqiu, Zhang Dingzhao, Li Guofan, Tang Baojia, Liang Deguang, Yu Tianguang, Liu Chongben, Guo Yujie, Wang Shuqing, Lu Zengkui, Zhu Min... Yu Zhizhong, Wang Ziyang, Wang Yiwu, Wang Jun, Zhang Zhengshu, Huang Ruigong, Li Daozhi, Li Tiansheng,... Chunhua, Yu Liming, Yu Lihua, Zhu Shangwei, Xu Yugong, Li Huiguan.

Track and Field Team Neatly Arranged

The Sansheng Track and Field Team was recently formed. President Pan, noting that track and field in this city lacks leadership and has been declining, has actively planned venues and searched for famous track and field athletes to form this team. He specially invited Qian Xucang, a senior figure in the sports world, to serve as the instructor, and publicly elected... Zhong as the captain to engage in training. In the near future, they will arrange a competition with track and field teams from friendly nations in the city to learn from each other. The team has Wang Xuewu, Guan Hongda, Yu Liming, Wang Jinghu, Luo Da, Guo Tingyao, Wu... Nian,... Jinhai, Zhu Shafei, etc., and the lineup can be said to be neat. In the future, they will also focus on training new talents to create rising stars and establish a good foundation for Chinese track and field. The team list is as follows: (Instructor) Qian Xucang, (Manager) Guan Hongda, Wang Xuewu, (Officer) Li Sicong, Dai Yanwan, (Clerk) Wu Hongbai, (Captain) Li Zhenzhong, (Members) Guan Hongda, Wang Xuewu, Yu Liming, Luo Da, Guo Tingyao, Zhu Shafei, Wu Huanian, Liao Jinhai, Wu Hongbai, Qian Zhenxing, Dai... Wan, Jin Jiayan, Wang Jinghu, Li Sicong, Yang Cunren, Yu Lihua, Wang Zhiyi, Zhu Jiakun, Xu Jian, Luo Lie.

Women's Basketball and Volleyball Teams Formed One After Another

In terms of women's sports, basketball and volleyball teams have been formed. The basketball team is based on Bai E, and will participate in the opening guest of the Health Cup, defeating Huada by... to 20, which is amazing. In addition to basketball team members Shi... Juan, Li Bo, Wang Gezhi, Zhao... Qing, Lu Cuifang, Wang Shijuan, and Hu Meixian... The volleyball team also has volleyball player Zhu Shifang and others participating. The team was just established and has not yet played, but its strength is expected to be extremely abundant, and it will surely show its edge in the future and dominate Shanghai. The lineup of the volleyball team is recorded as follows: (Women's Basketball) Shi... Juan, (Captain) Li Bo, Lu... Fang, Wang Shijuan, Zhu Yongyu, Zhao Diqing, Wang Fuzhi, Zhou Yueying, Hu Meixian, Chen Zezhuang, Liu Zan.

Chen Huilian, Lu Yu, Ma Ruicin, Jiang..., Qu Huan, Shen... Ying, Liu Yuebao, Zhou Xiang, Yang Shuan.

The organization of the association is as described above, and its purpose is even more pure. Here, we sincerely hope that under the leadership of Mr. Pan, the affairs of the Sansheng Sports Association will become increasingly prosperous, which will not only be a blessing for the citizens of Shanghai, but also a fortune for the nation and the country. (Zhang He)

### Shanghai Swimming This Summer Achieves Considerable Results

Wen Jingling Achieves Excellent 800-Yard Time in Yesterday's Shanghai Open Swimming Competition

The hot summer is almost over. The situation for Shanghai swimming this summer differs slightly from previous years due to various reasons, with fewer swimming pools open. According to investigations, only the following locations are open to the public: Zhang Yuan Swimming Pool, Hongkou Swimming Pool, Sichuan Road YMCA, West China YMCA, and French Chamber of Commerce, among others. Compared to the flourishing state of previous years, it feels slightly inferior.

Overview of Various Swimming Pools

Both Zhang Yuan and Hongkou Swimming Pools have good locations. However, Zhang Yuan's fees are high, and the Hongkou Swimming Pool is far away on Jiangwan Road, making transportation inconvenient. Not many people go swimming there. The Sichuan Road YMCA swimming pool adopts a group swimming approach with lower fees. This season, more than 1,600 people participated, but it's not a place where you can just casually go and play. The West China YMCA swimming pool is only open to members of the Baojia Youth Group and the association this year. As for the French Chamber of Commerce swimming pool, it is entirely for foreigners.

Results Are Still Quite Good

Speaking of swimming talent and achievements, the lack of swimming pools has certainly had a significant impact. However, in yesterday's Shanghai Open Chinese Swimming Competition, considerable talent and achievements were still maintained, which is very gratifying. People like Wen Jingling, Wang Zhongcheng, Bai William, Xu Shouqiang, Diao Guohua, Chen Jingzhong, and Lu Huijie all achieved excellent results. In women's swimming, although the number of participants is small, people like Fang Tianji, Cheng Jinqian, and Shen Runming are outstanding women who received enthusiastic applause in every competition.

Swimming is one of the best exercises for strengthening the body and one of the most fun activities in the summer. Unfortunately, due to the high cost of swimsuits and tickets, it has become a luxury. It is hoped that next summer, it can be universally promoted, and more swimming pools can be built so that more people can enjoy the fun of water sports.

Scene from Yesterday's Competition

The Shanghai Sports Association and the Chinese YMCA jointly organized the Shanghai Open Swimming Competition yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM at the Sichuan Road YMCA. The atmosphere was enthusiastic. The results represent the achievements of Chinese swimming in Shanghai this year. Although the results of each event are not as good as those of previous years, Wen Jingling's 800-yard freestyle can be considered a good achievement. Furthermore, the freestyle sprint champion was originally Wen Jingling, but Wen gave up the 60-yard freestyle to participate in the 400- and 800-yard events, which he had never tried before. As a result, he surprisingly won first place in all events and won the individual championship, which is truly admirable. At the same time, veteran backstroker Wang Zhongcheng was able to continue to maintain his top position in the 60- and 100-yard backstroke, surpassing Xu Shouqiang, which is a pretty good result. Up-and-coming young swimmer Bai William is predicted to be able to surpass others in Shanghai in the freestyle sprint next year. Other veteran players are indeed showing that the younger generation is to be feared. As for the women's side, many did not participate, and others withdrew at the last minute, so the results were naturally not good. Shen Runming continued to swim in four events. Although the results were not like Wen Jingling's in the men's and women's events, where he won first place in all of them, her spirit is truly admirable! (Liu Hesheng)

### The City's Watched Football Three Giants Donghua Friendship Three Provinces Each Have Their Own Strengths

Football is the most eye-catching game in ball sports because it can attract a large audience. Especially this summer's football has become white-hot. Today there is a charity game, tomorrow a championship match, and the players are too busy. The players' skills have improved rapidly. Although playing football in the summer seems out of season, the emergence of football talent can also be celebrated for the future.

As the football season approaches, all teams in Shanghai are making major preparations. They are hiring generals, recruiting troops, and piecing things together. In addition to Donghua Friendship, the Chinese teams also have the emerging Three Provinces team. The three teams have become the top three.

Donghua

The style is purely Shanghai-style, and the talent is currently somewhat declining. The basic team members are only Zhang Banglun, Zhuang Jiren, Dai Linjing, Jia Youliang, Zhang Zhaocheng, Xu Wenkui, Wang Xisheng, Han Longhai, and eight others. Recently, it was heard that Sun Jinshun and Zhang Lingen may join. Wu Binghao will return to his old ways and serve his mother team. If this can become a reality, Donghua can restore its heyday. Goalkeeper Zhang Banglun has recently been working hard, with the potential to overwhelm Lianyi's Liu Xianhan. The two defenders, Zhuang Youren and Zhang Lingen, are steady and bold, respectively, and are well-matched. Central defender Han Longhai sits in the center, giving the feeling of being invincible, both a general and a minister, assisted by Zhang Zhaocheng and Wang Xisheng. The five forwards: Ah Jin as the main striker, Zhao Cheng charging, Xu Nianren as the right winger. Although this public player has a wide range of ball skills, his physical strength is not as good as others. Lao Sun is skilled in stationed defense, becoming better with age. The two wings, Jia Youliang and Wu Binghao, are the best right wings in Shanghai, whether it is a direct pass or a cross, it is just right. Wu Binghao has been away from Shanghai for many years and has been out of the football scene for several years. This time, his comeback will be extraordinary. Looking at the entire Donghua team, there is no flaw to attack. The formation is so neat that it can be called the best in Shanghai.

Lianyi

Lianyi was the most outstanding team in Shanghai last year, and the four heroes in the team won a lot of glory for the Chinese. Most of the team members are veterans. This season, due to personnel changes, there is a tendency to collapse, such as Zhuo Shijin's returning home and not returning, and Zhang Lingen and Sun Jinshun's departure. Although there are replacements, the strength is ultimately greatly reduced. Currently, the team has generals Liu Xianhan, Li Tiansheng, Song Jin, Sheng Wu Qixiang, Li Yichen, Gao Baozheng, Zhai Chunhua, Meng Yiliang, Zheng Qiquan, Cai Shengmiao, and Qu Yongfu. As for the vacancies left by Sun, Zhang, and Zhuo, Wu Qixiang will replace Zhuo Shijin, Meng Yiliang will temporarily replace Zhang Lingen, and Zheng Yingquan will replace Sun Jinshun's left wing, which should be able to maintain the situation.

Three Provinces

The Three Provinces team is an emerging force with Xuhui as the foundation. The team is full of rising stars and is not short of experienced players. Zhou Defa's fierce battle, Gao Zhiwen's agile skills, Zhai Yuanzhi's agile interception, and Zhong Ziqian's accurate shooting are all outstanding. The team's goal is to be happy, not to win the championship. It is heard that the team's organizer will go to Hong Kong and Macau to hire talents.

Other teams such as Hezhong, Anhua, Overseas Chinese, and Yousheng are also preparing in secret. (Personnel)

### Simple Fitness Training Method (I)

— Written by Tom — Translated by De

I. How to Stand Straight

The first principle of fitness is to have the correct posture, and the second is how to maintain that posture. This is not only for aesthetic reasons, but also closely related to health, hence its importance.

To achieve this posture, stand against a wall. First, touch the wall with your heels, then try to have as much of the rest of your body against the wall as possible. Your head should also be back and resting on the wall. Your chin should be slightly tucked in. When you adopt this posture, you can see that your chest is expanded and your muscles are strong, which allows you to maintain the position of your chest without it expanding and contracting with your breathing.

The above is just one way to achieve the goal, and it is the first step towards correct posture. Move your entire posture forward while keeping your feet still. Except for the ankle joint, all other joints should also be kept still. From this, you can see that the correct posture is an automatic (firm) chest, a tucked-in abdomen, and the center of gravity of the body away from the heels, with the whole body upright.

People who tend to be obese will inevitably shift their body backward, with their chest sinking and their abdomen protruding, which is the opposite of correct posture.

II. How to Walk

When walking, the body should be stable, with the legs doing the work. The chest leads forward (do not let the abdomen go forward), and the toes and heels should touch the ground at the same time.

After the body is stable, take a few steps. The initial impulse seems to come from the thigh. At this time, you will feel that your steps are light, which you have never experienced before. Before long, it can become second nature, and you will feel uncomfortable if you don't maintain this correct posture.

III. How to Sit

It is not uncommon for people not to know how to sit. However, even those who know how to sit do not know how to sit in a way that is beneficial to their health. If readers doubt my words, please observe how children in schools, clerks in front of writing desks, and anyone eat. Generally, they sit too close to the table, causing them to lean forward, bending and twisting their vital internal organs, such as the heart, stomach, and liver, into one place. Indigestion, sluggish liver function, irregular heart action, and headaches are all inevitable consequences.

Therefore, when sitting in a chair, the body should be as far back as possible, but do not lean against the back of the chair. The spine should be straight, as in the correct standing posture. This allows the base of the spine to be supported, and the body can move freely while sitting, just as the ankle joint can move freely while standing. The chair should also not be too close to the desk or dining table.

IV. How to Rest

How few people in the world know how to rest properly. Sitting still is not the same as resting. To rest completely, the muscles must be relaxed, the body and mind must be relaxed, and the head, hands, and feet must all be at rest. If you lean back in a chair and feel comfortable and satisfied, you may as well lean back and discard all depressing thoughts, driving them away to nowhere.

When writing in books, if you feel mentally tired and your brain is gradually losing its ability to function and understand, the best way is to do some exercise, such as slowly lifting your heels off the ground and touching the ground with your toes, about forty or fifty times. This method can draw blood, although slightly, to supply the muscles and form the result of increasing brain activity without adverse effects.

The best time for the body and mind, especially the brain nerves, to rest is after noon. This is a rest that everyone should have.

V. Casual Sleep

This is the Spanish style of sleeping. In Spain and Mexico, the climate is hot and the days are long, so it is necessary to take a nap. However, in northern countries, an afternoon nap is also essential. The difference is that Spaniards sleep for two or three hours, while we can fall asleep in about two minutes through a kind of self-hypnosis.

VI. Self-Hypnosis

Do not lie down after a full meal to avoid crowding the digestive organs. Sit in an armchair with your head resting on the back, or in any kind of chair, as long as it is high enough to rest your head on it. The chair should be slightly reclined, and your feet should be placed on a chair of the same height, or slightly higher than the chair you are sitting in. Cross your feet at the ankles, clasp your hands together, interlock your fingers, and bring the muscles at the ends of your thumbs together. Close your eyes and concentrate, taking deep breaths. At this time, apart from silently counting slow and measured breaths, eliminate all distracting thoughts, and you can fall asleep within two minutes. The first experiment may not be effective, but after several practices, you can do as you please. Before going to sleep, remind yourself to wake up within fifteen minutes, and you will be almost accurate.
