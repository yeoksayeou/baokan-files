### Expectations for the Opening of the Securities Exchange

After holding its resumption ceremony on September 29th, the Chinese Securities Exchange, after four decades of preparation, is scheduled to officially open today. It will initially use Chinese stocks as trading instruments, limited to spot transactions with settlement the following day.

From the perspective of absorbing idle social capital and invigorating finance, the resumption of the securities exchange should be beneficial to the overall economic problem. Examining the industrial development of advanced countries, much relies on the securities market. For example...

Facilitating Investment of Small Amounts of Capital, Accumulating Small Sums into Large Amounts

The huge capital required by modern large enterprises cannot be handled by a few private partnerships. Through the medium of the market, large amounts of capital can be raised.

With a lively securities market, banks or private individuals who invest in securities can sell them at any time if necessary, thus facilitating the smooth flow of funds.

Without a securities market, banks are wary of providing loans secured by securities for fear of freezing their funds and are reluctant to do so. With a securities market, securities have a daily market price, making them as liquid as cash. Collateral is easier to obtain, and finance is more flexible.

Industrial and commercial stocks, or government bonds, have a broader market and can be auctioned on the exchange. Stocks and bonds have daily market prices and can be sold on the exchange at any time, so those with surplus funds can confidently purchase stocks and bonds. The securities exchange can become a powerful institution for issuing stocks and promoting bonds, while also absorbing idle capital and reducing the surplus purchasing power in society.

However, opposing arguments are not entirely absent. From a financial standpoint, the financial industry is already gradually becoming more relaxed, and it should not be further invigorated, as it is believed that the securities exchange will encourage speculation, and unstable stock prices will do more harm than good. During wartime, all countries control credit and manage the issuance of new stocks or the sale of old stocks in order to prevent surplus purchasing power in society from being absorbed by unnecessary and unsubstantial companies through stock offerings, thus preventing it from contributing to undertakings that are truly beneficial to the national economy, people's livelihoods, and the victory of the war. At present, credit is already perceived as excessive, and there is no time to examine banks and tighten credit. How can we then establish a securities exchange, further increasing credit excess? This view, based on the current situation, is not without its biases, but we must be mindful of potential dangers in times of peace and take it as a warning to be prepared for.

Now that the securities exchange is officially open, there is, of course, no need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of its creation and existence. However, we have listed the above two opposing viewpoints in the hope that the exchange authorities will always be cautious and self-reflective, considering whether the progress of business is suitable for the beneficial aspects of industrial development and whether it avoids speculation and manipulation, and is not exploited by fraudulent companies. At the beginning of the exchange's opening, we sincerely offer this to the authorities for their keen attention.

Secondly, on the day after the exchange held its resumption ceremony, we raised three points in the editorial: "Prevent speculation and manipulation," "Strictly review the qualifications of listed stocks," and "Rationally assess stock values and prevent drastic fluctuations," hoping that the exchange would pay attention to them. Regarding the first point, the exchange has reviewed the listed stocks and announced them in two batches, totaling as many as 108 companies. We certainly have no reason to point out any issues with their qualifications, but based on our intuition and usual observations, the quantity does not seem to have been "strictly reviewed." Regarding the first half of the second point, "rationally assess stock values," we have not seen a determination, and trading has already begun today. The values are presumably based on past market prices and have not been "rationally assessed." Therefore, the strict review of stock qualifications and the rational assessment of stock values are still issues. However, we urge the exchange authorities to pay close attention to preventing speculation and manipulation, and preventing drastic fluctuations in the future.

The securities exchange business is related to the entire industrial finance and the entire national economy and people's livelihoods. "Public interest" and "private interest," "the greater self" and "the lesser self" should always serve as warning bells, moving forward on the right path. We would like to express our sincere wishes to the exchange authorities and all those directly and indirectly involved!

The various countries and nations of Greater East Asia have been freed from the oppression of Britain and the United States for many years, and they are pursuing their own paths in accordance with lofty principles to achieve the great cause of Greater East Asia construction. We must ensure that Greater East Asia is forever a Greater East Asia of Greater East Asia to ensure lasting world peace. However, the enemy, Britain and the United States, are still repeatedly acting recklessly, attempting to seize Greater East Asia. Therefore, all of East Asia should further recognize the common mission, gather all forces with unwavering belief in victory, thoroughly complete the Greater East Asia War, prevent Britain and the United States from again running rampant in Greater East Asia, and cooperate to build a new world order. This resolution was passed on November 7th of the 18th year of Showa (32nd year of the Republic of China) at the Greater East Asia Solidarity People's Congress.

### Individual and Joint Efforts to Complete the Liberation of Greater East Asia: Remarks by Representative Wang to Reporters

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Wang, President of the Executive Yuan of our country and representative to the Greater East Asia Conference, met with a group of reporters on the 7th and made the following remarks:

It is a great honor for me to participate in the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo, Japan, an event of great significance in world history. In the conference, I was able to listen to the great views of Prime Minister Tojo Hideki of Japan and admire the speeches and styles of the representatives of various countries in Greater East Asia. I cannot help but express my sincere admiration. Recalling the past hundred years, the aggressor countries of Britain and the United States have carried out their policies of aggression and exploitation, and their ambition to encroach on the whole world has been unceasing. British forces advanced from Southeast Asia and launched the Opium War in China. The United States also entered East Asia from the Pacific, forming a pincer movement with Britain. At that time, the crisis of the East Asian nations was imminent, but Japan rose up and restrained Britain and the United States. Although they suffered a blow, their ambitions did not die. Instead, they specialized in provoking conflicts among the East Asian nations, causing constant unrest. It was not until the start of the Greater East Asia War that the forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia collapsed, and their policies and ambitions of aggression and exploitation were completely overturned by Japan. From this, it can be said that Japan's contribution to protecting East Asia is admired by all the nations of Greater East Asia. However, Japan did not stop there. Recognizing that the harm Britain and the United States inflicted on East Asia lay in their policies of exploitation and aggression, it went on to fundamentally overturn their traditional policies, changing one-sided aggression into coexistence, and one-sided exploitation into co-prosperity. It enabled the nations of East Asia to achieve their own independence and respect each other's independence, to promote their manufacturing and negotiation capabilities in culture, and to complement each other's strengths and share each other's needs in the economy. This basic strategy is the opposite of the traditional policies of Britain and the United States. This is the spirit of Eastern morality, not a utilitarian view without direction. This Greater East Asia Conference was initiated by Japan, uniting the countries of East Asia to seek the practice of this moral spirit with the strength of unity. This great undertaking is not only the foundation for lasting friendship among the countries of Greater East Asia, but also the foundation for lasting peace in the world. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China, once said that the Meiji Restoration of Japan was a turning point for Asia. This sentence has now been proven to be true. Dr. Sun's advocated Pan-Asianism and his hope for Japan's assistance in abolishing unequal treaties with China have all been realized. A few days ago, I signed the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty with the Japanese Ambassador to China. Today, I am even more honored and excited to represent the Chinese people and participate in the Greater East Asia Conference, signing the joint declaration. I firmly believe that all the representatives attending the conference share the same enthusiasm and belief, that is, the Greater East Asia War will surely be completed, and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will surely be built. I am even more convinced that to achieve the above goals and complete the above tasks, it all depends on the individual efforts and joint efforts of all the countries and nations of Greater East Asia. Our chosen nation of Japan has already exerted its greatest strength to protect East Asia in the front. We, the emerging countries, and the countries striving for revitalization, must all do our best to share the responsibility of completing the war and completing the construction. The bright and brilliant undertaking of Greater East Asia can only be realized through the individual efforts and joint efforts of all the countries and nations of Greater East Asia. The policies of aggression and exploitation previously used by Britain and the United States have been shattered, and their policy of provoking division has also become a bubble. In the future, no matter what policies they use, whether it is to lure us with sweet words and issue so-called empty checks, or to create all kinds of rumors, they cannot shake our slightest belief. We will never again be oppressed by them, and we will especially never be deceived by them. We believe that as a result of our individual and joint efforts, the countries of Greater East Asia will surely liberate Greater East Asia, and surely make the light of Greater East Asia shine upon the world. Here, I express my greatest respect to our ally Japan and to all friendly nations.

Questions and Answers with Reporters

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The following is the transcript of the questions and answers between Representative Wang, President of the Executive Yuan, and a group of reporters during the Greater East Asia Conference. (Question) After the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, what impact will it have on China? (Answer) First, from the perspective of the general public in the peace zone, after the signing of this Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, the hope and light of the future have been clearly confirmed. War is painful for both sides, but the question is to which side the future hope belongs. Those who have this hope can overcome many difficulties and hardships. Although the people in the peace zone of China also feel the same pain, since the establishment of this Sino-Japanese Alliance, they have found the light of the future in the pain. The Chinese people are always sincerely grateful for the light given by Japan. Furthermore, as for the Chongqing side, they are still not awake from their dreams. Since they are compatriots, thinking of them, I feel particularly hurt. The propaganda policy of the Chongqing side originally had two points: one was the argument of resistance to the war before the war, that the country would be destroyed if they resisted, and that the country would also be destroyed if they did not resist, which can be said to be extremely pessimistic propaganda; the other was that after the Greater East Asia War, they argued that if Japan wins the Greater East Asia War, it would be unfavorable to China, which can also be said to be propaganda based on a pessimistic mentality. This treaty replaces this pessimism with optimism, so that they can thoroughly understand the true meaning of this treaty. There are three types of people on the Chongqing side, namely, pessimistic people, those who understand the general trend but do not speak of it, and those who have no opinion. Therefore, I intend to enable these people from all aspects to thoroughly understand the true meaning of the treaty. (Question) What is the current economic situation in China with price and food issues as the center? (Answer) We will try our best to eliminate the suffering caused by the war, and those that cannot be eliminated must be endured. Therefore, we should improve what should be improved in the three points of Sino-Japanese cooperation methods, control methods, and clean government, and hope to relieve the pain of the people. (Question) What are the policies to strengthen political and economic power? (Answer) The key points are to purify thought, ensure security, and increase production. There is no need to discuss the former two again. As for increasing production, we plan to actively increase agricultural production and develop light industry along the line. (Question) What are the concrete policies to assist India? (Answer) With China's current strength, we cannot talk about concrete ways to assist India. China intends to use its inadequate material and mental strength to strive to assist India's independence as a loyal member of the co-prosperity sphere. We are truly indignant for the sake of the Indian people about the famine in India. As a result of this Greater East Asia Conference, Japan and the countries of the co-prosperity sphere will actively assist India. This can also be said to be finding hope in suffering.

### Anniversary of the Soviet Revolution: Stalin's Speech

Ankara, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Reuters: Moscow news, the Central Committee of the Communist Party convened a meeting on Saturday to celebrate the 26th anniversary of the Communist Revolution. Stalin himself delivered a brief speech. His speech focused on the development of military affairs. He reported the victory of the Red Army and warned that this victory was not the final victory, because the number of German divisions on the front line had increased from 240 last year to 257 this year. Stalin then appealed to the military and civilians at home or on the front line to continue their efforts, especially since the Soviet Union's heavy industry center had already been moved to the west, while a large number of agricultural areas had been abandoned. Stalin only briefly mentioned the Moscow Conference and its results in the political aspect. Attendees included high-ranking Soviet officials, political figures, and representatives of the Moscow garrison and the Red Army.

### Japanese Troops in Hunan Province Occupy Nan County

Hankou, 7th (Central News Agency) - On the Hunan front, the Japanese troops are continuing their rapid advance. They defeated two divisions of the Chongqing army in the Jiudu Dahe area and completely occupied the strategic point of Nan County at dawn on the 3rd.

### Suhuai Administrative Commissioner Goes to Suxian to Take Office

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - Zhang Jiang, the administrative inspector and commissioner of the Third District of Suhuai, went to Suxian a few days ago to take office. The commissioner's office was officially established on the first of this month.

### Statement by Prime Minister Tojo: Actively Assist India and Cede Two Islands as Territory

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - At the Greater East Asia Conference on the afternoon of the 6th, Jiang Tela Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, requested that the countries of Greater East Asia assist India in its struggle for independence.

### Japanese Army Launches Large-Scale Offensive in the Dongting Lake Area - With the Great Power of a Raging Tide -

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese China Expeditionary Force, in response to the operations on the Yunnan-Burma border, launched a large-scale offensive in the northwest Dongting Lake area in central China on November 2, attacking the sixth war zone, the first line of defense for Chongqing, breaking through the Chongqing positions with the force of a raging tide, and achieving great results. Since Chen Cheng, commander of the war zone, was transferred to Yunnan Province as commander of the Chongqing army, his vacancy was filled by Sun Shu, who attempted to counterattack by seeking opportunities, but because the Japanese army took the initiative this time, the Chongqing army's attempt was thwarted. In addition, when the Japanese army carried out the Jiangnan operation in May of this year, it defeated 180,000 Chongqing troops, destroying their war resistance organization. It is reported that the area is a granary area for Chongqing. After being severely damaged by the Japanese army, it has repeatedly tried to restore itself for half a year. This time, it suffered another blow from the Japanese army and was severely damaged. The sixth war zone is mostly paddy fields, with large and small rivers crisscrossing it. It is extremely difficult for the Japanese army to advance, but it was finally able to overcome this unfavorable terrain and fight fiercely. At the same time, the Japanese air force and ground forces cooperated closely, obtaining considerable results in their vigorous operations.

### Youth Leaders Conference to Be Held on a Grand Scale in Japan: Strengthening the Connection and Cooperation of Youth in Various Countries

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The first Greater East Asia Youth Leaders Conference will be held on a grand scale at the Japan Youth Hall in Tokyo from the 12th to the 16th of this month. This is the first step in launching a great movement to awaken all Asian youth in response to the call for the Ten Million People's Uprising following the Greater East Asia Conference, and it is worthy of attention. The conference is hosted by the Greater Japan Youth Group and is divided into two parts: the Representative Conference and the Executive Committee Conference. It is planned that the two parts will discuss the specific policies for the great unity of youth in Greater East Asia in the first two days, and then visit various places on the third day.

### Key Points of Speeches by Representatives at the National Rally of Japanese Citizens - Japanese Prime Minister

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech at the National Rally of Citizens of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. The main points are as follows: Today, we convene this grand rally of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, and we are deeply honored to have representatives from China, Manchuria, the Philippines, Burma, and the Provisional Government of India present. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the situation has completely changed. Our Japanese soldiers and officers have fought bravely, and we have driven out the forces of aggression that the United States and Britain have exerted in East Asia for many years. The new construction of Greater East Asia is being realized steadily amidst the total counteroffensive of the enemy, and the foundation of the new Greater East Asia has been laid. Now, representatives of the Greater East Asian nations have gathered in Tokyo to conduct the Greater East Asia Conference, and have already achieved brilliant results. Furthermore, we are holding a grand national rally here today, which is truly a great event of the 20th century. Now, the countries of Greater East Asia are united internally in trust and harmony, and externally are exerting all their strength to defeat the counteroffensive of Britain and the United States. We have long anticipated that Britain and the United States would rely on their material resources to launch repeated counteroffensives, but the righteous army is invincible. Since the mantle of justice rests with our Greater East Asian nations, victory will surely belong to us. In the preliminary battles, we have already achieved immense results and gained a strategically advantageous position to secure victory. Furthermore, Japan has strengthened its domestic posture to prepare for the decisive battle and enhance its war capabilities. In addition, the Greater East Asian nations are determined to cooperate closely with Japan, exert all their strength to defeat the counteroffensive of Britain and the United States, and strive for the permanent stability of Greater East Asia. This is the reason why we are confident that we will win. Looking at Germany and its allied nations in Europe, they are resolutely implementing new combat strategies under national unity to annihilate Britain and the United States. Therefore, we should fight to the end with unwavering fighting spirit under the belief that we will win. This rally has fully demonstrated our unwavering belief in victory and our indomitable fighting spirit, which is truly gratifying.

Wang President

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The representative of our country, Executive Yuan President Wang, delivered a speech at the National Rally of Greater East Asia, stating the following key points:

I am deeply honored to participate in this grand National Rally hosted by Japan today. The two countries of China and Japan have laid the foundation for the permanent relationship between the two countries by signing the alliance treaty. The Greater East Asia Conference has been successfully concluded, and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has been announced to the world. China is determined to cooperate with the countries of Greater East Asia and move forward together towards a bright future. The Greater East Asia enterprise can only be realized if it is undertaken by the people of East Asia themselves. For a hundred years, Britain and the United States have exploited and invaded East Asia to the fullest extent. When Britain and the United States attempted to annex the entire world with their ambition and violence, Japan confronted them head-on, preventing their ambition and violence. As a result, East Asia was able to be defended. This is truly the result of the independent struggle of the Japanese people, and it is truly admirable. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has once again used its national power to defeat the violence of Britain and the United States in East Asia, returning East Asia to the people of East Asia. The affairs of East Asia have been taken over by the East Asians themselves, and it has been agreed that the East Asians will work together as one. All of us East Asians, especially the Chinese, express our heartfelt gratitude for this spirit of Japan, and we should fulfill the hopes of the Japanese people. However, even today, there are still some people in China who have not yet broken free from the shackles of Britain and the United States, which is truly regrettable. I am determined to continue to strive to urge these compatriots to awaken as soon as possible, break free from the shackles of Britain and the United States, and stand in the same position as us. Gentlemen of the National Rally, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, the National Government hoped that the day would come when it could share joys and sorrows with Japan, and decided to share life and death with Japan. Since then, this determination has become increasingly firm.

Thai Representative

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - Prince Wan Waithayakon, the representative of Thailand, spoke at the National Rally as follows: This National Rally has fully demonstrated the Japanese people's united determination to complete the Greater East Asia War. Thailand has been friends with Japan for hundreds of years, and now it is further advancing to become allies with Japan, cooperating and advancing together for the construction of the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.

Manchu Premier

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Prime Minister of Manchuria, Zhang, spoke at the National Rally of Greater East Asia as follows: I am taking this opportunity to participate in the Greater East Asia Conference, and I am impressed to see that everyone's belief in victory is stronger than before, and that everyone is diligently fulfilling their duties. Our Manchuria, based on the righteousness of the joint defense between Japan and Manchuria and the unity of Japan and Manchuria, is striving forward without rest day and night, with its 40 million people, to achieve the great mission of protecting the frontier and building the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. Now, thanks to the brave battles of the Japanese soldiers, the forces of Britain and the United States have been completely driven out of East Asia. As the decisive battle with the Allied countries unfolds around the world, I am grateful to see the brave posture of the Japanese people moving towards the completion of the war. After returning home, I am determined to inspire the 40 million people of Manchuria to emulate this, and contribute to enhancing Japan's war capabilities with unwavering belief in victory.

Philippine President

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The representative of the Philippines, President Laurel, spoke at the National Rally of Greater East Asia as follows: It is a glorious event in history that the Philippine people are appealing to the world as representatives of a free and independent nation. The countries of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere are holding a conference to discuss common issues, and the Philippine people are deeply honored to send representatives to attend. Japan and the Philippines have signed an alliance treaty covering various sectors, including politics, economy, and military affairs. The Filipinos are now uniting with a clearer belief and fighting bravely to build a great Philippines, aiming to become a glorious member of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. The Japanese army is now achieving successive victories. As Prime Minister Tojo stated, the countries within the Co-prosperity Sphere are a powerful group dedicated under a common and unified ideal and purpose, and are making every effort to complete the foundational work of unifying the peoples of Greater East Asia. Only then can the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere be realized.

Burmese Representative

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The key points of the speech by the Burmese representative, Prime Minister Ba Maw, at the National Rally of Greater East Asia are as follows: The enemy has recently been bombing Burma day and night, causing the Burmese people's lives and property to suffer from the ravages of war, but Burma will never succumb to this. We remain united in our will, unwavering, and we must fight to the very end. I am confident that we will fight to the very end no matter when, where, or under what circumstances. Having witnessed this grand rally, I am convinced that this is the call for the overall progress of Greater East Asia. East Asia is the East Asia of East Asians, and the security of Greater East Asia should be ensured by the peoples of Greater East Asia. This Greater East Asia movement must start with the determination of the peoples of Greater East Asia. I hereby represent ____.

Indian Representative

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, Chandra Bose, spoke at the National Rally of National Unity of Greater East Asia as follows: The Greater East Asia Conference and the Joint Declaration will become the great charter for the peoples of Greater East Asia to move towards freedom and liberation, and will soon become the great charter for all freedom-loving people in the world. The Indian people are determined to confront the common enemy under the leadership of the Provisional Government of India. The results of the Greater East Asia Conference have made us feel the invincible and undefeated posture of Japan and the firm determination of the 1 billion people of East Asia, and we are even more courageous to move forward. Based on good intentions, Japan announced that it would return the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to the Provisional Government of India in the near future. This important statement has given a great impetus to all Indians. We are determined to overcome all difficulties and fight to the end. We are determined to destroy Britain and regain our freedom. All preparations for Indian independence have been completed and are poised to be launched. From today onwards, we will take the first powerful step.

German Ambassador

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The German Ambassador to Japan, Stahmer, delivered a speech on behalf of the Axis powers at the National Rally of Greater East Asia, as follows: Leaders of the allied nations, Japan, and the countries of Greater East Asia, today's gathering and the holding of the National Rally are of profound significance. You have not only announced to the world the indomitable will of the nations and peoples of East Asia, but also temporarily advanced with a united and determined will towards a common goal. A large part of the great cause of a new order of peace in Greater East Asia has been realized. The ambitions of Britain and the United States have been permanently expelled from the territory of Greater East Asia. Germany and the European allied nations are determined to unite firmly with Japan and the countries of Greater East Asia, and fight until we achieve a common victory and establish lasting peace.

### Flour Distribution - New Organization to be Established - Actual Rationing of Cooking Oil Under Consideration

Central News Agency - Following the transfer of rice purchase and transport in the three provinces and two cities to the Commercial Control Association, I am proceeding in that direction. Regarding the flour issue, it is said that a new distribution organization will be established. Before the establishment of this organization, the old rules will still be followed. As for the supply of daily cooking oil, the Commercial Control Association is currently considering actual rationing measures. Once a decision is made, it will be implemented.

The Kugan Troupe is holding a long-term charity performance for the Student Aid Fund of this newspaper. The first production, "Gone with the Wind" (A Tale of a Turbulent World), has been staged at the Paris Grand Theater and has been a great success. This is because the original play is a famous work, and it is even more moving when it is put on stage, which is one reason; The Kugan troupe's directors and actors are all leading figures in the theatrical world, and their joint performance is wonderful, which is another reason: The five main characters in "Gone with the Wind", such as Scarlett O'Hara, Wesley, the American, Charles Hamilton, Rhett Butler, etc., were originally played by Lan Lan, Shi Hui, Mo Chou, Wang Jun. Hao Ren and others played the roles. It is difficult for Hao You to play the role of Rhett Butler, and he is a newcomer. He is still studying at the Law School of Peking University and his vacation is only for one month. Now that the period has expired, he will return to the north.

### The New Cast Begins Today

Therefore, the cast of "" will be adjusted by Kugan from today according to the planned plan. Shi Hui will play Rhett Butler: Bai Wen will play Wesley; Yang will play Dr. Mi, and it is believed that this selection will better perform. On the performance side, it will also be more spectacular. Wang " "The two heroines in the play are particularly important because of the play, and will also be changed for the performance, so that the original actors can rest, and other actors can get a chance to practice. --The Kugan actors have no leading or supporting roles, and each actor has superb acting skills, and strives to give each actor a chance to perform. New plays are coming one after another

In addition, Kugan's director and guidance part is strong, so the repertoire performed is fully prepared in terms of quality and quantity.

It is heard that the Kugan troupe, due to the nature of the charity performance, only allows surplus and no loss, so each play will be replaced with a new repertoire if the venue is not a success, so those who want to watch the Kugan new play must do so as soon as possible, (Note: From November, it is stipulated that the Saturday and Sunday and Sunday night shows will reserve 50 tickets for honors and each ticket will be 150 yuan, in addition to the basic ticket of 50 yuan, the remaining 100 yuan will be used for student aid, the report published yesterday was 100 yuan per ticket, which is actually 150 yuan.)

Short Commentary

### Military Police Strictly Punish Extortion Cases

In the editorial of this newspaper on October 28, we talked about how citizens should cooperate with public security issues. For the cases handled by the Allied Military Police or the police agencies in this city, if citizens are involved in the case and are summoned, first, they must tell the truth and not lie or fabricate anything. Second, they must not be nervous or afraid, and accept the treatment frankly. After proper questioning and investigation, if they are innocent, they will be released. They must not be deceived by a small number of unscrupulous people and use bribery, which will only make things worse. Third, if they believe they are innocent and are falsely accused by someone attempting to extort money, they must truthfully state the facts and not use bribery. Those who extort money can be counter-sued, so they cannot use their tricks.

Today, this newspaper reported that the Allied Military Police uncovered two cases of extortion. Those who were falsely accused were released after questioning, while those who committed extortion were counter-sued. On the one hand, we admire the seriousness of the Military Police in handling cases. At the same time, we especially want to inform our fellow citizens that everyone must recognize clearly that they are not afraid of things and cooperate with the authorities to ensure that cases of false accusation and extortion disappear in the future. In addition, we also hope that those who impersonate others and extort money will quickly realize their mistakes and change their ways. Why bother to test the law and be despised by the public?

### Summary of Market Conditions

Dried Longan from Guilin and Xinghua: Arrivals are scarce due to limited boat shipments, and sailing junks are also unable to transport goods due to unfavorable winds. Therefore, prices in the market have remained stable. However, recent news from industry insiders indicates that production prices have begun to loosen. Since transportation is temporarily impossible, those with older stock have had to lower their prices.

Black Fungus: Since the arrival of new crops, the amount of goods has gradually increased. Therefore, damp fungus has had to be sold off at market prices, causing prices to drop by 10-20% compared to their previous high levels. However, news from the producing areas indicates that production prices are tight this season, so selling at current market prices will result in losses.

Woolen Fabrics: Prices have not fluctuated significantly in recent days due to a balance between supply and demand. However, the prices of woven fabrics such as printed calico, waterproof cloth, horsehair interlining, French lining, grey soft lining, and grey bag cloth are all rising. This is because factory goods have already been registered and cannot be moved. Production is uncertain due to the indefinite allocation of raw materials, so users are trying to purchase and store goods in advance, fearing shortages.

### Solidarity of Greater East Asia and Political Offensive Against the Enemy

Since the beginning of this year, Japan has been launching political initiatives to construct the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In January, the 81st Diet session developed policies for constructing Greater East Asia, including Burmese independence. Subsequently, in the extraordinary 82nd Diet session in August, comprehensive political measures were announced, revealing the content of the Greater East Asia Declaration. Adhering to the founding ideals, Japan is engaged in the construction of Greater East Asia. The magnificent attitude of the Japanese Empire and the cooperation of the hundreds of millions of people in the South are a serious blow to the enemy countries, Britain and the United States. Churchill, Willkie, Grew, Eden, and other leading figures in Britain and the United States have all stated that the progress of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is excellent proof of their hard work. We call it the Greater East Asia political offensive. Corresponding to the powerful actions to annihilate the enemy, it forms the backbone of Greater East Asia. The majestic vision and its progress are tantamount to a head-on blow to Britain and the United States, who hope to restore East Asia to their colonial rule.

In wartime, it is essential to develop the resources of Greater East Asia to strengthen Japan's war effort. This is the foundation for promoting the war. At the same time, liberating Greater East Asia, which has long groaned under the yoke of Britain and the United States, so that all nations can find their place, is the ideological foundation of the war, which is our war aim. The independence of Burma and the Philippines, the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and the participation of Javanese in government have been successively implemented, inspiring all nations in Greater East Asia and enhancing their determination to unite to win the war. The enemy has already sensed this resolve of the nations to drive Britain and the United States out of East Asia forever. Even the self-proclaimed Anglo-Saxons have felt the difficulties of the Pacific War. The measures agreed upon since the beginning of this year have been steadily implemented in the second half of the year and have been done so thoroughly. It is believed that by the end of this year, this Greater East Asia political offensive will have great achievements to show.

Three Aspects of Construction

The current construction of Greater East Asia is achieved through the simultaneous advancement of military warfare, political measures, and economic development. Regarding military warfare, the initial glorious victories and subsequent brave operations have come to an end. Fierce battles are still continuing around the Japanese-occupied territories. The nature of this war is that the enemy, who suffered heavy losses at the beginning of the war, has taken a year and a half to recover somewhat and is now launching a counterattack to regain Japan's victories. Therefore, this counterattack has a significant impact on the construction of Greater East Asia. Moreover, the enemy intends to carry out this counterattack in conjunction with military warfare, attempting to undermine the unity of Greater East Asia by shaking the spirit of the Greater East Asia nations. Therefore, the Greater East Asia unity becomes a major issue here. The success or failure of Greater East Asia unity will have serious consequences. Japan's successive implementation of political measures towards the nations and peoples of Greater East Asia has glorious significance, and how the nations cooperate with us and whether they truly understand the meaning of the East Asia liberation war is the greatest foundation for thwarting the enemy's counterattack intentions.

Meaning of East Asia Unity

Prime Minister Tojo's remarks to the people upon returning from his inspection of the South clearly provide a reassuring answer regarding the Greater East Asia unity. He said:

The hundreds of millions of people of Greater East Asia already understand our true intentions. Everyone knows that Greater East Asia cannot be liberated without Japan completing the Greater East Asia War, and that the welfare of the Greater East Asia people cannot be discussed without the proclaimed construction of Greater East Asia. This conviction fills the hearts of every individual.

These words indicate that the construction of Greater East Asia has a bedrock foundation despite any discord sown by Britain and the United States or their planned counterattacks. Elevating the hearts of all nations is the ideal of Greater East Asia construction, not the ambition to restore the colonies of Britain and the United States. Japan's consistent policy is to liberate Greater East Asia from the yoke of Britain and the United States and restore the original face of Asia. This policy has already penetrated deeply into Greater East Asia. The ideal of allowing all nations to find their place has already been demonstrated to the world, stirring the hearts of the Greater East Asia nations. As long as Japan adheres to its commitments, it will implement them in a short period of time. Its just and fair attitude, standing on the foundation of morality, can be immediately proven by facts. This is the greatest driving force for the Greater East Asia nations to wholeheartedly trust Japan, a far cry from the exploitative attitude and the concept of slave discrimination practiced by Britain and the United States for their own benefit.

### Record of a Submarine Sinking Enemy Ships

In the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, the ebb and flow of the war between Japan and the United States, and the flexibility of supply and transport capabilities, can tip the balance of the war. Therefore, the supply and transport disruption war has become the key to victory or defeat. The enemy is launching submarine attacks to disrupt supply and transport with increasing intensity. The fact that six enemy submarines were sunk in Japanese waters and other operational sea areas in September shows how aggressively the enemy is trying to disrupt our supply and transport. At the same time, because Japanese submarines operate with a ghostly elusiveness, the enemy must redouble their efforts in the anti-submarine war. In the South Pacific today, aircraft, destroyers, and patrol boats are being used, and all kinds of modern weapons, such as radio-wave detectors, are being mobilized for extraordinary vigilance. However, the submarine warriors of Japan, relying on a do-or-die spirit, break through the enemy's tight defensive network and eliminate all enemy supply ships or reinforcements destined for the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, one ship each day. On the evening of October 3rd, the 〇〇 submarine discovered three enemy destroyers and immediately sank two of them. This is the true story of the 〇〇 submarine, whose crew, reported by the Asahi Shimbun correspondent, sank an enemy Class B cruiser in the waters east of New Hebrides on the night of September 12th.

An Order Given

While rising and falling in the sea, carefully observing, the navigator suddenly shouted, "There seems to be a cruiser at 〇〇 degrees, distance 〇〇 ri!" An order was given to prepare for torpedo warfare. At that moment, the atmosphere inside the ship became tense. As the distance between the two ships decreased, the enemy ship blatantly headed towards our bow. Suddenly, an emergency alarm sounded inside the ship, saying that it was a destroyer, and we had to dive quickly.

In the midst of the tension, several depth charges exploded, and our ship was wounded. Vital parts were hit, and it was impossible to determine the extent of the damage, but we remained calm and repaired the damage.

Observing the Enemy Ship

At 00:00 on the 12th, at a location 〇〇 ri east of New Hebrides, the hydrophone operator shouted to the conning tower. The periscope also peered above the surface, and two masts were spotted on the horizon. Soon the four suns set, and on the night of the 13th, the moon illuminated the sea. Our ship surfaced on the eastern horizon, and then quickly returned to the water as an enemy ship passed directly in front. It was ordered to prepare for torpedo warfare. The crew waited quietly to strike. The distance closed step by step, and the enemy ships could be seen clearly through the periscope. In the front was a warship, seemingly an Achilles-class cruiser, followed by a tanker, and finally a destroyer. After the captain confirmed this, he called into the speaking tube, "One warship, one tanker, and one destroyer!" The warriors on board became instantly tense, as if they had received something important.

Enemy Ship Sunk

"Attack!" The order was given, and 〇 torpedoes were fired at the cruiser. In an extremely short time, that enemy cruiser was destroyed. Later, the hydrophone operator reported that the enemy cruiser had indeed sunk, and cheers erupted. The Japanese submarine's swift achievements are truly outstanding, and it is no accident that it is called the Lord of the Seas. (Translated by Chi Ching, from the October 10th Asahi Shimbun)

### Gallant Fight of Submarine in Chichagof Harbor

Submarine I-〇〇, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Kikunori Inoue, with the conviction of certain victory, boldly and deeply penetrated into Chichagof Harbor within the Aleutian Islands, which was heavily defended by the powerful enemy fleet. Under the relentless enemy barrage of depth charges, it dauntlessly carried out three fierce attacks within two days. However, finally it ascended to the heavens and became a guardian spirit for the northern Pacific Ocean.

Staff Officer Recounts the Battle Situation

A staff officer of the fleet recounted the battle situation as follows: "On May 12th, with the heavy fog that day, and under the protection of a powerful fleet composed of aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, the enemy began landing troops on Attu Island using numerous transport ships. Although the enemy had a strong air force in the vicinity of the Aleutian Islands, with aircraft carriers constantly launching attacks, and even battleships carrying out bombardments, the first to attack this imposing maritime force was our submarine force operating in the nearby waters. At that time, I-〇〇 submarine immediately advanced towards Attu Island. Because submarine forces often have to undertake extraordinary missions that require sneaking into enemy waters in the treacherous wind and waves of the North Pacific Ocean, the submarine was overjoyed at obtaining its first chance to attack enemy ships. Regarding the bravery of the crew of I-〇〇 submarine, the telegram it sent before setting out on the mission is also telling:

"We bravely set out to exterminate the enemy forces."

I-〇〇 Fires Torpedoes

Under the protection of a powerful fleet composed of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, the enemy convoy entered Chichagof Harbor. I-〇〇 submarine boldly penetrated the enemy defense network in order to attack the best targets within Chichagof Harbor. At the same time, our submarine also took advantage of the heavy fog to engage in a fierce hand-to-hand combat with the enemy warships during the day. As confirmed by the Attu Island garrison, at 13:30 on May 13th, two columns of water rose high beside an enemy warship floating on the sea. They were caused by torpedoes fired by I-〇〇 submarine. The panic of the enemy fleet could be clearly seen from the land, as destroyers raced around and began dropping depth charges. However, I-〇〇 submarine did not miss any opportunity to strike the enemy, and at 18:30 on the afternoon of the same day, it again attacked enemy warships gathered together, with one warship emitting a wisp of black smoke, like a fire, which was observed by the Attu Island garrison until 11:00 that night."

Enemy Ships Damaged

At that time, the fog was extremely thick around Attu Island, and even the sea surface was completely shrouded in thick fog. It was indeed very difficult to accurately assess the results of the attacks, but the attacks greatly boosted the morale of our Attu Island garrison, which goes without saying. The next day, although I-〇〇 submarine was subjected to a fierce counterattack by the enemy, it ignored everything and again attacked enemy naval forces outside Chichagof Harbor. At 10:30 on the 14th, two columns of water were again seen rising beside a U.S. Class B cruiser, submerging the masts. The fog was still very heavy. Although the U.S. Class B cruiser was not sunk, the fact that it was damaged was confirmed. It is very difficult to navigate in the fog, and yet the submarine broke through the enemy's defensive network and rushed into the heart of the enemy fleet, and not giving in to enemy counterattacks, carried out a bold attack for two days. One enemy Class B cruiser was sunk or damaged, one battleship was severely damaged, and the type of damage to another ship was unknown. This is the outstanding achievement of I-〇〇 submarine.

However, that submarine ultimately did not return, and its commander, Lieutenant Commander Kikunori Inoue, and all the crew members died along with the submarine. (Translated by Shin from the September 24th Asahi Shimbun) ×××

### Remembering a Friend

— Lou Min

— With high officials and noble lords in the capital, this man is forlorn.

I don't know if it's the aging of my mind or loneliness, but I've been living in the past lately, constantly chewing over memories. Especially in moments of quiet contemplation, I fill the blank spaces of my books and the gaps between the lines of my papers with fleeting emotions and events. How pitiful humans are! If the world is a stage, they often appear as protagonists in tragedies but as clowns in comedies; even laughter is tinged with tears. Needless to say, my memories are more gray than brilliant. For example, when I think of a close friend, melancholy fills my heart…

Yes, in these times, death is commonplace, let alone a mild case of lung disease. But you can't deny that humans are emotional creatures. I met him when I first learned how to write the words "friend." By the time we could use the term "soulmate" in our writing, I couldn't spend a day without him. Over the years, we understood each other. Even when there were misunderstandings, resolving them helped us understand each other even better. "I've met many people," he said, "but none can understand me as deeply as you." Remembering my own feelings, I believe these weren't empty words. Imagine, if we lived in the same city, I could visit him every day, knowing he was ill. Now he's somewhere far away, how can I not be filled with worries?

A person whose heart is as cold as ashes is as unhealthy as someone who is ill. But for my friend, illness is the only restraint on his will to live! He has Byron's passion, Napoleon's perseverance, and what he seeks is nothing less than a settled life. The night before he left Shanghai (these five years have been so long!), he talked to me about this broken world, which cannot be fixed with piecemeal solutions. His eyes shining, he struck the table with his fist and said:

"I want to destroy it, and then create it!"

"Is it possible, do you think?"

"I believe it is, it certainly is!"

Oh, my heart trembled. Who would expect the sadness of an eagle with broken wings? How threatening is ill health to a healthy life! And yet, I truly feel my own insignificance when he whispered in my ear:

"Until the moment I die, I want to fight reality!"

But… like Xiang Yu at Gaixia, or Napoleon exiled to Saint Helena, this is always a tragic thing, isn't it? Especially because I am so selfish, he is my friend, my friend!

To relive the friendship he and I shared, I reread his letters. Most of them have been lost, and only a few from the past two or three years remain. "You've gained weight, you're living a more rational life, aren't you?" He wrote after receiving my photograph. "But I'm still struggling against reality, hoping for the future!" He has a delicate heart. Thinking of his warm home in Shanghai, his letters are filled with nostalgia: "It's the season for flowers now, have you been near any red flowers symbolizing happiness? The fields of Jiangnan have the bright light of spring, why are you still so melancholy!" He traveled everywhere, finally arriving at Mount Emei. In the summer of the year before last, I received a letter from him without a return address, telling me that after several sleepless nights, he had decided to follow in the footsteps of Ban Chao… Since then, I haven't received any letters from him, and I have no way to send him any. I secretly wish him good health, I deeply miss him. But who knew that from a friend who had returned from afar after getting married, I would learn that he hasn't been doing well in recent years… Really? Really? I went from missing him to feeling melancholy.

In his belongings, I found a piece of his prose and, to comfort myself and his friends who long for him, I sent it to a bi-monthly publication. He wrote in bold strokes about his belief in "fire." Yes, this essay is a ball of fire that makes me feel warm!

It's late, it's time for me to put down my pen and go to find him in my dreams. He's someone who hates using words for show or play, and I'm worried that he'll complain that I wrote this…

### Miss K's Moment in the Spotlight

— Fang Lin

Indeed, Miss K has been very pleased lately.

Having barely scraped through university, a famous English language school in Shanghai, she's now overflowing with foreign airs and in the spotlight. Never mind if it's just for a year or two, a gilded surface always shines. Her dowry can also include a "University Certificate of Partial Completion," what glory! And it adds a bit of luster to her future husband's face.

Moreover, Miss K shyly tells people that she has found a fiancé, a handsome man, with a graceful demeanor, so "romantic," young, and promising, overflowing with talent, working as a "university teaching assistant." When people mention "your Mr. P," her face is filled with vitality, but sometimes she also hints at three parts worry, "He's very romantic, and very friendly, quite handsome, and his profession is sacred, but his family's finances are two parts worse than mine, (not quite three). People say that 'daughters should climb upwards,' but I'm doing the opposite. Sigh, people can't have everything. But I think it's just talk, there's no real "classism" inside… haha.” “That's right, I think you're really in love, not taking money as a prerequisite, but it's a bit of a compromise for you, Miss…"

In addition, Miss K is a "new woman," shouting for female liberation and economic independence. Therefore, as soon as she left the university, she started teaching in a middle school, teaching a foreign language that's not much different from Chinese. (Those who don't know the details might believe that she's a university graduate, and pity her for not using her education, and that education needs to be reformed). When people ask about her "career," she answers with a smile… "Sigh, just doing education (career), teaching is okay, but you eat a lot of chalk dust. I'm not stupid, I rarely write on the blackboard, I let the class monitor correct the homework. I teach the students to study on their own, or tell stories, to increase extracurricular knowledge. Seriously, rote learning is useless." When people ask about her salary: "Limited, limited, one or two thousand is enough for my spending money, my standard of living is high. Anyway, you know, my family has a lot of money, I'm independent, I don't want to be a pampered young lady… haha…"

You see, not to mention other things like being good at dealing with people, adapting to the environment, flattery, having a good financial situation, a rosy face, being popular, not suffering losses, and being able to cope with things with ease, those are also important. Just these three big things: Education, love, and career, are enough to be in the spotlight.

Who can say that Miss K is not worthy of pride?

### Late Autumn Stroll

— Chunxin

The setting sun casts shadows everywhere, dinner settles heavily, the wind blows gently, leaves scatter beside the road. In the clear, white sky, a few black crows punctuate the evening scene, with a long "caw" that shatters the stifled silence, then fly towards the east in a line.

"Has autumn arrived?" Pacing beside the road, I cannot help but be stunned by this desolate autumn scene. How quickly time passes! Am I getting old?

Over the past year, I have struggled bitterly with life. I lost my teaching position due to illness. I shed no tears. I grew calm and aged like autumn. I only feel a bit heartbroken—like a young girl who has lost her love.

I pick up a fallen leaf beside the road. Although I am abandoned by the world, the fallen leaf is no different. I take it back, put it on my desk, and clip it in a book. It's better than having it trampled on by people! Besides, aren't we both pitiful, insignificant sufferers of the same plight? Yet, I pity the fallen leaf, but who pities me?

I lift my heavy footsteps and slowly walk home, secretly singing praises to the fallen leaf:

"Fallen leaf, fallen leaf, I will bury you in the darkness, through the late autumn and harsh winter;

In the bright sunshine of next spring, under the warm and radiant sun, can you revive?!

You must cheer up! You must revive, you must survive;

Otherwise, you will have let down my painstaking efforts."

### Heart's Melody

— Lujin

Heart, the heart of an innocent child!

Heart, the heart of a jackal!

In moments of triumph;

One feels the warmth of human hearts!

In times of despair;

One deeply feels the icy fog of human hearts;

Beautiful words gush forth!—

Those are the sweet nectar from the depths of a tender heart!

Venomous, stinging words are attached to them—

Those are sharp arrows from the depths of a cruel heart!

How many kind people;

Are pushed forward by the trusting, affectionate stream,

How many kind people;

Have their lives taken by bloodless, murderous weapons!

Heart, the heart of an innocent child!

Heart, the heart of a jackal!

In this dark human world!

One can see hearts as malicious as snakes and scorpions!

But that innocent heart!

Is as rare as the morning star!

### The Fall of A-Lin

— Ji Wei

The weather grows colder by the day, and those who fear the cold are already wearing fox fur coats. A-Lin—the nephew of Huang Gong—has once again appeared near the imposing iron gates of the Huang mansion. He wears a tattered coat, like a honeycomb, and wears broken slippers. He's still in a stupor, but still walks with a certain swagger.

It's early winter, and most people have returned to their homes to enjoy the warmth of the fireplace. When the cold wind blows, it feels strangely piercing. A-Lin is trying hard to gather his spirits and wait by the gate of the Huang mansion. He thinks, it's almost time to eat again.

"Ah...ya...ee." The side door of Huang Gong's residence opens halfway, and a steaming bowl of rice is handed out. Then the door is closed again. Silence still occupies the space, except for the distant sound of a dog barking. It is almost a world without people. A-Lin chews slowly and silently, remembering a day five years ago. ×××

It was a sunny day with gentle breezes and a clear sky. The Huang mansion was bustling with activity, everyone busy to the point of being breathless. Lanterns and colorful decorations were hung everywhere, and the managers were running around inside and out, sweating profusely... The reason was that the nephew was getting married. Of course! The nephew was generous and tolerant, and also had money... Who didn't think the nephew was good? In addition, the master was like a tiger with wings, so the words "official" and "wealth" had long become commonplace. Few people were qualified to compare with Master Lin. A-Lin, who had long lost the love of his parents, now gained a beautiful family and started his new life.

The bride came from a gentry family with traditional values, and she had been carefully selected. Everyone said it was a match made in heaven. ×××

However, unexpected things happen in the world. A-Lin, enticed by several bad friends, gradually became involved in improper activities like visiting prostitutes. At first, it was done secretly, but later he acted openly and brazenly. Huang Lao-ye and Huang Tai-tai loved him, which gradually sowed the seeds of disaster.

Furthermore, his wife, who was said to be a match made in heaven, actually passed away early. Following this, he started associating with concubines, Mrs. Cao... ah, gambling and carousing, spending his days and nights immersed in smoky dens and sweaty casinos. Sometimes he gambled so much that he didn't come home for dinner. As a result, the husband sang and the wife followed. One frequented prostitutes, and the other indulged in gambling, and both fell for Ah Ying and Rong Fang... It was unbearable... A-Lin secretly sold the title deeds, and his concubine ran away with someone...

In this way, the old master in the Huang mansion finally woke up. The speculative wealth that he had accumulated with his life and despicable means was half squandered by his nephew and his wife. He was so heartbroken that he kicked A-Lin out.

Everyone! Do you know who A-Lin is? Well, every morning you can see him in the small market, stealing and robbing women and children, or begging money from couples on the Four Roads, West Roads, and South Roads... or... You can easily encounter many people like A-Lin in your daily life.

### Leisure

— Lu Xunting

Everything is consumed and fades away most quickly in a moment of "leisure."

A friend wrote in a letter, "The whole day is like a lifeless object steeped in incense. I understand in my heart, but I feel listless. The planned schedule doesn't move at all. The days are passing faster and faster." This is a good description of the word "leisure."

Nervous weakness has occasional moments of excitement, but leisure is always a makeshift, a tormenting thing. Only busy people can feel it, and leisure only gives people a bitter, dry, and dissatisfied feeling.

Quiet is harmonious, but leisure is painful.

"Leisure" belongs to those who have retired from the world or failed in their careers, or those who have achieved success and retired. Their lives are not really leisurely.

Sports

### Xuhui Middle School Promotes Football as Early as Forty Years Ago. All Students Kicked a Ball for One Hour Every Day. Training Courses and Football Exams Were Established.

Xuhui Middle School in Xujiahui was founded in 1850. It can be said to be one of the schools with the longest history in the country. Its educational policy emphasizes moral, intellectual, and physical development. A large sports field is set up next to the school building, so that students can use it during rest periods after class. Football is relatively able to allow a large number of people to participate together, and the interest is more likely to last, so it is strongly promoted. As early as forty years ago, a football team was established.

Friendly Matches Held

At that time, there were very few football teams in Shanghai, and there was no cup or league organization. Therefore, after the establishment of the Xuhui team, it only played friendly matches several times a year with a few teams such as Nanyang Public School (now Jiaotong University), exchanging skills. One of the school publications published by the school in 1909, "Jiangxue Bian," already contained school news about sports, "Eleven players, including An Xiang, Wu Jiabin, Shen Renbao, Wang Zhenshi, Shen Xisheng, etc., all strive to be the first, understand the general rules, defend like sleeping lions, and fight like fierce tigers. Once on the field, they have the labor of generals purchasing the Huns. On the tenth day of the month, they played against Quanzhang Public School, scoring four goals..." At that time, the coach was the teacher Song Wanqing's father, who loved sports and was good at football. His guiding principle was to use "various methods to guide the players to realize the principle of cooperation," and he especially paid attention to the players' sportsmanship and morality. After many years of training, the skills improved steadily.

Participate in the League and Win Honors

In 1925, it participated in the "Shanghai Chinese Football Association" B-League for the first time, and was the champion of the group. Finally, it played against Aurora University in the final and won the championship. The following year, the Chinese Football Association divided the competition into five groups. Xuhui was listed in the "Zhong" group. Although it realized that its physical strength was too poor, it requested to change the group, but the committee insisted that Xuhui, as the champion of the previous B group, must be promoted to the "Zhong" group. As a result, it had six wins and one loss, and won the second place. After the league ended in February of that year, the sports column of Shen Bao added a comment on Xuhui, an excerpt of which is as follows:

"...In terms of spirit, Xuhui should be regarded as the best. The school's players not only show absolute respect and obedience to the referee's decisions, but also show respect.

Its management is particularly commendable. For example, after the referee is appointed by the association, the school often asks for another confirmation. For example, when both parties agree to change the time of the game, in addition to sending a letter to the association, the school must also send a letter to the team. If there are any questions, they must personally inquire at the association. For every game, the game report must be signed by the referee, and regardless of wind or rain, someone must be sent to the association within one hour. This kind of spirit is truly commendable and can be a model for all schools and sports organizations in our country..."

From 1930 to 1933, it won the first Catholic Athletic Federation A-League football championship for three consecutive years and permanently retained it. In 1935, it won the second championship of the federation again, but since then, the championship has not continued to be held, and it is still retained by the federation.

Football Popularized Throughout the School

In the autumn of 1936, Father Wang Fang, the current director of physical education at the school, launched a class-based sports competition. The competition items were temporarily limited to football, in addition to tennis and basketball. More emphasis was placed on football, including large football, small football, and mini-football. High school and junior high school were divided into groups, and one silver cup was prepared for each item in each group. The names of the winning classes in each session are engraved on the cup for encouragement.

In the spring of 1941, in order to commemorate the 90th anniversary of its founding, the school's sports department sponsored the "19 Cup" Shanghai Secondary School Mini-Football League. A large silver cup was donated by alumnus Yu Junhou. It has been held for three sessions, and the championship has been won by the "Yan" team in each session.

Since the elementary school department moved to the original site of Qianhui Normal School in the autumn of 1940, the school is now divided into six colleges, each with its own football field. At the same time, students are allowed to play freely. Every afternoon after class, everyone kicks the ball for one hour, which is called public ball. Those who don't play big ball at least kick small leather balls. Therefore, football in the school is not monopolized by a small number of players, but is completely universal. During the public ball time every day, each college has a coach with football experience on the field to guide them. In addition to the usual ordinary practice, the A and B teams of the school team practice on a large scale once a week.

Special Training Classes Established

Regarding the training of football skills, a special training class is set up. Any student with school status who feels capable of sports can sign up to join for free. All expenses are provided by the school. It is divided into four groups: elementary, intermediate, advanced, and specialized. The specialized group is divided into three subjects: special techniques, dribbling skills, and cooperation principles and implementation. The teaching materials for the four groups are all based on the school's specially compiled football lectures. At the end of each period, there are written exams, oral exams, and football exams. According to the director of physical education, this kind of training and exams are all held during after-school rest or holidays, without hindering academic studies. After passing the advanced exam, the sports department will issue a "Football Diploma," stating that the player has received considerable training and has had considerable achievements in participating in various competitions, and is qualified to coach ordinary teams and players in the future.

Football Written Exam Questions

Here are one or two types of written exam questions for the training class to show the content of the textbook.

### China Film Women's Basketball Team Makes First Public Appearance — A Galaxy of Stars, Intense Interest —

The China Film Women's Basketball Team, which has been rumored for a long time, had its first official practice a few days ago (the 5th). Those who heard the news rushed to the team's field on Haige Road for a complete viewing.

The players who attended that day were Wang Danfeng, Wang Yuan, Li Lihua, Hu Feng, Chen Juanjuan, Zhang Minyu, Ma Lan, Mu Wan'er, Feng Fei, Xi Qiu, etc. Those who were absent due to other matters included Zhou Manfei, Zhou Xuan, Li Hong, Zhang Fan, etc. However, the stars were already dazzling and overwhelming. Because the news of the practice was kept absolutely secret, only reporters sat quietly on the sidelines, leisurely.

Basic Practice

The practice program was coached by observing basic movements. There were things like line passing, circle passing, arbitrary triangle passing, dribbling, tracking dribbling, stationary dribbling, throwing, baseline throwing, mid-range kicking, long-range throwing, left rotation, right rotation, two hard catches, soft catches, high catches, and middle catches. Coach Qian Xucang explained and took on the role of practical coach. The female stars practiced in turn, with intense interest. Among the techniques, Zhang Minyu (daughter of Zhang Shichuan) was the best, with a solid foundation and fantastic shots under the basket. Li Lihua and Wang Yuan are rich in health and beauty and are typical of players, so they should not be underestimated. Hu Feng's height is suitable for a forward. Chen Juanru is lively. Wen Feng is agile, and Wang Danfeng is able to do as she pleases. In the opinion of the reporter, they are definitely a complete women's basketball team. Given time, it will not be difficult to make a splash on the basketball court. The most noteworthy thing is that the posture of each team member is uniquely beautiful and fascinating due to their natural talent.

Two Hours Long

The team's first practice lasted for two hours. The female stars still felt very interested, but I don't know if Coach Qian was already covered in sweat. The reporter said goodbye when Captain Hu Feng thanked the coach. On the way home, I deeply pondered that Chinese female stars have always been known for their delicacy, but now they are active in the basketball world, reducing their former shyness and dominating the court, which is creating a new era in film history. It is worthy of our praise and encouragement.

Various Forms

When Wang Danfeng plays basketball, she is full of youthful vigor and is as pleasing as the Green Team's Yan Weiwen!

Wang Yuan doesn't forget to put on makeup when playing basketball, with heavy makeup and wearing gloves. Hu Feng does not easily wear shorts. The reason is that Miss Hu's legs are too thin, so there may be a discussion of ribs. She also said that she is deeply concerned about the possibility of slingshot stones outside the field!

Chen Juanjuan repeatedly failed to throw the ball in, seemingly complaining that the basket was too small and that the ball was too heavy. Wang Danfeng disagreed and tried to throw the ball from half court. As a result, she used all her strength and only reached two-thirds of the way. Juanjuan laughed loudly.

Tao Jizhi saw that Coach Qian was too strenuous, so she helped pass the ball. However, because of her slender figure and fashionable clothes, she was called a Russian girl, and Tao couldn't help but blush.

Zhang Minyu said that practicing basketball at least won't make us have huge bodies or be called ribs, and of course, we can have a healthier performance on the screen. To make our sick man exhale! How splendid this statement is!

Qian Xucang said: In at most a month and a half, he intends to compete with the women's basketball teams in Shanghai! (Mei Bixian)

### Fieldside Notes

Donghua is the most successful in breaking through three barriers with one knife. In the Comforting Spirit Cup, it defeated Qiaolian 2-1. In the fundraising competition for the Poor Education Foundation, it lost to Xilian 3-1. In the recent fundraising for the Children's Library, it defeated Portugal 4-1. So-called great masterpieces. Its tacit understanding cannot be denied as the leader in Shanghai. Donghua athletes are very energetic!

The Three Provinces Women's Basketball Team participated in various competitions a month ago with great momentum. Since the battle against the Luyu team on the 20th of last month, it lost 9 to 65. The team's spirit disintegrated, and it completely withdrew from the scene. Although they are female heroes, they cannot escape the affectations of ladies. A laugh.

Li Zhenzhong, as a special member of Huaying Company, has been cast as a physical education teacher in the film "Jinxiu Qiancheng." Therefore, he has recently participated in the performances of the Huaying basketball team. In the upcoming Xiqing Championships, he will still serve "Zhongbei."

A friend came from the Bund and said that gateball is popular everywhere. Because he is unfamiliar with the matter, he makes it difficult for the referee every time he participates in the game, which often leads to all-out brawls.

Before the Western basketball season, the teams are recruiting talents. There is also the establishment of the Eastern basketball team, which is generally a sister team of the Paramount. There are Tao Shaosheng and He Xiaoguang from the Red Team, and Xiang Zhi and Lu En from the Paramount Team. There is also the revival of the Huaye Team, with the addition of Kong Guangyi and Zhang Liangxuan. (Skinny Person)

### Simple Fitness Training Method (8)

— Written by Tom, Translated by Yide

21\. Neck Exercise

Exercise 1

There are two benefits to exercising the neck... First, flexible joints; second, strong neck muscles, which can make a thin neck (especially for those who are thin) covered with solid muscles. To achieve this goal, you must go beyond the scope taught by ordinary aesthetic exercise teachers.

Slowly lower your head forward and downward, as low as possible, so that the sternocleidomastoid muscles are fully stretched, and the waist muscles do not move at all. That is, the body does not sway. Slowly raise your head and push it back as much as possible.

This exercise should not be done casually, but should be done with purpose. Do not make sudden movements. You should be slow and forceful.

Neck Exercise: Head forward, return to position; head backward, return to position.

Note: Practice in batches, three times forward and backward is enough. Exercise 2: Slowly tilt your head to the left shoulder, so that the neck muscles are fully stretched. Do not sway or bend your body. Do not rotate your head or raise your shoulders. Slowly raise your head, then slowly tilt it to your right shoulder. Do not sway or bend your body. Do not rotate your head or raise your shoulders.

Neck Exercise: Tilt to the left, return to position; tilt to the right, return to position.

Note: Practice in batches, three times left and right is enough.

Exercise 3

Balance your head. Slowly turn to the left until it becomes a profile. Keep your head straight and your body still. Then slowly turn to the front. Then slowly turn to the right until it becomes a profile. Maintain the balance of the head. Regarding the rotation of the head, questions will inevitably arise. The author has abandoned this lifeless exercise and used exercises that stretch the neck muscles. Neck Exercise: Head turns to the left, return to position; head turns to the right, return to position.

Note: Practice in batches, three times left and right is enough.
