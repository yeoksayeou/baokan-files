Albanian Coastline
Completely Under German Control - Italian Army Disarmament Proceeding Smoothly
Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to authorities here, after German troops occupied the Cattaro naval port in Dalmatia on the 15th, the Dalmatian and Albanian coastlines are now completely under German control. German artillery units are actively strengthening coastal fortifications taken over from the Italian army, while at the same time smoothly disarming the Italian army in Albania, Montenegro, and Croatia. Several Italian boats in the Albanian port of Sarandë once attempted to flee, but were intercepted by German forces. The number of Albanian mountain troops joining the German army is increasing daily. Italian troops in Agram and Zagreb in Croatia have joined the German ranks. Italian anti-aircraft artillery units on Crete Island have begun to resist the anti-Axis forces. Furthermore, the solid military facilities on Rhodes Island (at the entrance to the Aegean Sea) are all under German control. Italian transport ships, warships, and airfields have all been occupied by German forces. Italian security units and Blackshirts are all under German command and are taking unified action with German soldiers.

German Counterattack Successful in Salerno, Italy
British and American Landing Forces' Communication Cut Off
Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Hai Tong News Agency: If the anti-Axis forces in Salerno fail to muster a large number of reinforcements, their beachhead fortress is unlikely to be preserved. The communication between the American forces south of Eboli and the British forces in Salerno has now been cut off. American forces continue to resist fiercely in the coastal areas, with naval artillery fire providing cover. Although the American forces have received some reinforcements in the past 24 hours, their strength is still insufficient to launch an offensive. The British forces have also not attempted a breakout in the past 48 hours. General Clark seems intent on holding out regardless of sacrifice, awaiting the arrival of the British Eighth Army. This critical period may last four or five more days. The British Eighth Army has completed half the journey between Reggio Calabria and Salerno. The slow progress is due to the complete destruction of the roads and the resistance of the German rearguard. However, its vanguard has traveled as far as 50 kilometers in the past 24 hours. In short, the American Fifth Army and the three British divisions on the northern flank of Salerno have suffered extremely heavy losses in both soldiers and equipment. If the German forces can drive these six Allied divisions into the sea, it would be an unprecedented victory.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to German News Agency: On Tuesday evening, the American forces in the Salerno area, protected by the flank fire of countless warships, showed extremely strong resistance. However, the German High Command's objective has been achieved, which is to cut off the communication between the British forces stationed in Salerno and the American bridgehead to the south. The combat effectiveness of the enemy forces in these two areas has been greatly weakened due to the very heavy casualties, prisoners, and equipment losses. As a result, even with reinforcements landing at the American bridgehead on Tuesday evening, the enemy is no longer able to mount a large-scale offensive. The German forces are now holding high ground positions, while the American forces are crowded together, part of them becoming increasingly congested in the swampy area near the Sele River. American forces are desperately attempting to break through the German positions with tanks and mechanized units, but these attempts have completely collapsed under the fire of German artillery and infantry automatic weapons. The German forces are pursuing the enemy, tightening their encirclement, and driving the American forces back to the coast. The German forces responsible for this task have withdrawn from the American bridgehead according to the original plan and are instead attacking the British bridgehead in Salerno. From this, it can be seen that the enemy's situation is hopeless. Meanwhile, the German Air Force continues to attack the British and American fleets day and night. In the past 36 hours, it has sunk or severely damaged a total of fourteen enemy transport ships, totaling 49,000 tons. Eight landing craft full of enemy troops were either sunk or set on fire by low-flying German aircraft. At the same time, a large number of exploding bombs have greatly increased the number of enemy casualties.

Italian Concession in Tianjin
Taken Over by Japanese Army
Tianjin, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Due to the treacherous surrender of the Italian Badoglio regime, the Italian concession in Tianjin has been occupied and taken over by the Japanese army. Some unscrupulous merchants who previously used the concession as a hiding place have now disappeared, which is very good for the future of Tianjin's economy. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Italian concession has become the only refuge for third-country nationals and some unscrupulous Chinese merchants. After the implementation of the policy of reorganizing and controlling financial institutions in North China, some Chinese banks fled into the Italian concession, and unscrupulous merchants also secretly operated through the concession. Therefore, with this takeover, these merchants have lost their hiding place. Tianjin's economic measures will become smoother, which will greatly benefit the stability of prices and the well-being of the people.

Rome, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Today, the Italian Prime Minister issued Government Order No. 6, appointing Lieutenant General Licci as Commander-in-Chief of the Militia to protect national security.

Meaning of the Fascist Party's Name Change
Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Hai Tong News Agency's diplomatic correspondent reports: The continued validity of the joint Japan-Germany-Righteousness Three-Power Pact and the five government orders issued by Mussolini are sufficient to show that the Axis powers continue to resist. The government is issuing in the name of righteousness, including restoring his personal leadership of the Fascist Party and appointing government leaders, and adding the word "Republican" above the Fascist Party, and restoring all those previously dismissed by the surrendered government. The new name of the Fascist Party actually shows that Mussolini and the Fascist Party no longer recognize the Italian monarchy, but are making Italy a republic, expressing Italy's determination to fight. Therefore, he ordered the Italians to take a mobile and cooperative attitude to fight side by side with the German army, because the Germans are now defending Italian territory. When Mussolini was imprisoned, he did not know about Badoglio's surrender or the landing of the anti-Axis forces, so he took decisive action as soon as he was freed.

Area Along the Desna River on the Eastern Front
Becomes the Center of the Great War - Fierce Street Fighting Unfolds in Novorossiysk
Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: The large-scale Soviet offensive is now expanding from the Chen Peng bridgehead to the northeastern area of Smolensk. The Soviet army has now added all available troops to the battle in order to determine victory or defeat before the muddy season arrives. The Soviet army's purpose is clearly to encircle the German army's westward movement on the north and south sides of the war center, in order to collapse the entire front line of the German army. The Soviet army suffered heavy losses in this battle.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Hai Tong News Agency: Military sources said yesterday: The center of the Soviet offensive on the Eastern Front is currently located on the Desna River southwest of the Kirov region in the south and the area north of the Moscow-Smolensk highway. There has been torrential rain in the Kupen River basin, but the weather remains very sunny from the northern shore of the Sea of Azov to the middle of the Eastern Front. The Soviet army in the south continues to attack the main German defense line on the western section of the Donets River, but each attack has been ineffective. Only the battle situation north of Poltava is unstable and has not yet ended. The Soviet offensive northwest of Kharkov is also sharp, so the German army has had to temporarily retreat, but after the German reinforcements counterattacked, they recovered the lost land. It is estimated that in a few hours, Soviet tanks lost more than 220 vehicles. Fierce fighting continues in the Desna River area. The Soviet army is trying to reach the west bank of the river and wants to expand its bridgehead fortress, but it has not succeeded in eliminating the German army's bridgehead on the east bank. There is now extremely fierce fighting between Roslavl and the Moscow-Smolensk highway, with strong Soviet troops attacking fiercely and breaking through the German line in several places. The German army's counterattack has turned the situation around. The Soviet army's offensive southwest of Kirov has not been successful.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to German front-line news: Soviet landing forces have broken into part of the important Black Sea naval port of Novorossiysk, and are currently engaged in fierce street fighting with the German garrison. It is reported that the area of the Soviet breakthrough is very small. According to Soviet telegrams, the breakthrough occurred in the northeastern part of the city.

Thousand German Aircraft Active on the Eastern Front
Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - This question publishes news: On Wednesday, the number of German aircraft dispatched on both parts of the Eastern Front reached dozens, all concentrating their attack on the Donets and Kharkov areas. On the central front, the German army also used thousands of aircraft, operating in the area east of Smolensk. German fighters shot down 14 enemy aircraft in one day, and German anti-aircraft artillery also shot down enemy aircraft. No German aircraft were lost.

Elastic Tactics Achieve Their Purpose
Stockholm, Sweden, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since the Soviet army began its summer offensive, more than 300 divisions, about 6 million troops, have been dispatched to the front line and have been fiercely attacking the German army for ten weeks, but have not achieved any results. The Soviet offensive on the central and southern front lines has been the most intense. In the past ten weeks, they have advanced 150 kilometers on the line from Izyum to Konotop, advanced 50 kilometers in the triangle of Oryol, Sukhinichi, and Bryansk, and advanced 120 kilometers from Taganrog to Mariupol, but have failed to encircle and annihilate the German army. Therefore, it can be seen that the German High Command's elastic tactics of conserving German military strength and gradually depleting Soviet military strength have been completely successful. In fact, the current German army is operating between 100 kilometers and 150 kilometers east of the Dnieper River, and is conducting operations in a straight line with the river, which proves the strength of the German army.

Japanese Embassy Coast Information Minister Holds Grand Tea Party to Entertain Chinese and Foreign Media in This City
Central News Agency reports that the newly appointed Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy in China, Weiichi Kishi, made a special trip from Nanjing to Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, at 2:30 PM, he hosted a reception for Chinese journalists in this city on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road, raising five questions, which lasted for an hour and a half. From 4:30 PM to 6:30 PM, Information Minister Kishi held a grand tea party at the Broadway Mansions to entertain Chinese, Japanese, and foreign media in Shanghai. From the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, ​​Information Section Chief Hirota, Secretary Iwai, Secretary Takahashi, Secretary Manabe, Secretary Mori, Translator Hirata, Deputy Consul Fukuma, etc. attended. From the Army Press Department, Chief Izubuchi, Lieutenant General Nakagawa, Lieutenant Sakamoto, etc. attended. From the Naval Press Department, Captain Nagashima, Lieutenant Shiotani, and Trustee Sakazume attended. Chinese media and film circles in this city, including Feng Jie, Yuan Shu, Xu Liqiu, Chen Binhe, Liang Shi, Zhu Baoheng, Lu Guangjie, Weng Yongqing, Cheng Zhongquan, Wang Ping, Yang Huilang, Zhang Shankun, Ma Zongyao, Qian Xiangyi, etc., and foreign reporters from various newspapers in Shanghai, more than 150 people, were cordially entertained by Mr. Kishi himself. Champagne was exchanged during the meeting, and the atmosphere was extremely cheerful.

Persist in Faith to Complete Great Fruit
Mr. Kishi introduced the following remarks: Mr. Kishi first said: "I have come to China from Japan this time. Since I took office, I have come to Shanghai from Nanjing today. I especially invite you to express my sincerity. As for the expansion by Mr. Koda, I will hold regular meetings every week to exchange opinions. Therefore, I will not make a speech today, but give some opinions for your reference and exchange," etc. Mr. Kishi continued: "I hope you will especially have the belief to complete the great fruit of tomorrow. In your country, after the recovery of the concessions, Shanghai has changed easily and has a new atmosphere, removing the dirt of Shanghai in the past. Now it has become a new Shanghai in the new China. Therefore, in order to build a new Greater Shanghai, there should be a new spiritual construction. Therefore, in the process of building a new Shanghai, have the concept of a new Shanghai tomorrow, in order to complete new hopes and strive to build a new

Should Eliminate Old Traditional Concepts
Mr. Kishi also said: "Our firm determination to understand the task and strive to do our best is the concept that the Axis countries have. The old traditional concepts are still being cleared in Shanghai. This is due to the influence of British and Japanese ideas in the past. Therefore, since we are a member of the Axis countries, we should work harder towards new ideas. Looking at the internal changes in Italy this time, Italy was originally a country building a new era. In order to complete the clear task, it worked hard to fight against Britain and the United States. Unfortunately, due to the old traditions not being cleared, it was divided into two factions. During this change, the representative of the old traditional policy, Marshal Badoglio, was still dreaming, relying on Britain and the United States, causing some of the people to lose their own will. The reason was that they were softened by the magical propaganda of Britain and the United States, causing them to lose their will to fight. In the process of building a new era, we will never allow the existence of old traditional concepts. You should be aware that after the establishment of the new regime in northern Italy centered on Mussolini, the three countries of Japan, Germany and Italy will continue to cooperate in fighting. However, due to this change in Italy, it has been completely renewed and the old concepts have been abandoned. However, it has been divided into two parts and the territory has become a war zone. The people throughout the country have suffered even more, especially since the establishment of the Badoglio regime. Therefore, on the new path, if you have old dreams, what will the result be? Therefore, you should reflect on it thoroughly.

Sincere Cooperation and Close Cooperation
Finally, Mr. Kishi said: "I will work hard to promote cooperation between China and Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Now, under equal conditions, China and Japan sincerely cooperate and are closely connected. Shanghai is the center of the entire culture and economy. Therefore, Shanghai is very important, especially the qualifications of journalists are even more important. Recently, the Propaganda Minister of the National Government also mentioned this issue at a meeting with Chinese journalists. Therefore, China and Japan should strengthen each other's ideals under mutual cooperation and hope to encourage each other."

Japanese Residents Should Pay Various Taxes
Then, Mr. Kishi answered five questions raised by reporters, including: Since your delegation implemented the new policy of reciprocity, the enemy has been deeply encouraged. I wonder to what extent the issues such as taxation have been negotiated? (Answer), The Hua party’s taxation on Japan was stipulated in the treaty concluded on July 31. The types of taxes were communicated from the Hua party to the Japanese party. It is expected that the first notification will be realized in the shortest possible period. Therefore, at that time, in the entire territory of China, most of the central and local taxes will be paid by Japanese residents, but among them, such as salt tax, unified supervision, tobacco and alcohol tax, and stamps, are included.

Recognize the Situation and Revitalize Industry
Shanghai Zuo Concession has been filled with a new atmosphere since its handover. However, what are the feelings of industry and commerce on this matter recently? (Answer), Shanghai is a port for trade and commerce. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, overseas trade suddenly ceased. Therefore, industry and commerce inevitably suffered a major blow. Therefore, some people in Shanghai will use the idle money that cannot be used due to the stagnation of trade for speculation and hoarding, causing Shanghai's economy to experience a significant deformity. After the return of the concession to China, the remnants of the international management in the past have been completely eliminated. In the future, the actual facilities of the Shangfa will be used to start manufacturing, which is a prerequisite. Therefore, I hope that the Shanghai economic community will deeply recognize the current situation and revive Shanghai's industry from a new perspective, so that it can become a powerful supply base within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which is of utmost importance.

Material Exchange is Under Consideration
The issue of material exchange has attracted much attention from the general public. I wonder if your country has given this matter thorough consideration? (Answer), The material exchange in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River has been eased after the agreement between China and Japan. The movement restriction will be relaxed after March 11 of this year, and the issue of conditions for the restoration of the economic foundation will be adjusted. After that, the material exchange between the Shangxu area and other ports will be promoted. However, the movement of certain materials has been restricted in order to ensure the needs of the people. This is an exceptional measure taken for the convenience of the majority. In addition, the Japanese side is also doing its best to consider the material exchange between Shanghai and Northern North, Manchuria, Japan, and Nanyang.

British and American Meetings Are Commonplace
Minister, what are your views on the current international labor situation, such as the Eastern Front and the Italian local war situation, and the meetings between Roosevelt and Churchill? (Answer) Regarding the war between Germany and the Soviet Union in the east, Germany has established a shortened front in the east to break the Soviet Union's combat power. As for the internal changes in Italy, Germany expected them long ago and had prepared to deal with Italy, so there was no impact. As for the meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill, it is a commonplace event that is not surprising. Previously, there have been many meetings. The British and American long-term war will have no satisfactory results in the future. If the two countries' operations are smooth, they do not need to meet. It is expected that the meeting between Luo and Qiu will become more frequent in the future, and there will be no results. This time, the goal is to discuss assistance to Chongqing and deal with Japan. Therefore, it is determined that Britain and the United States have no hope of victory in the Pacific. The British and American fighting beliefs are shaken, and the result is self-evident.

Is the Conflict between Chongqing and the Communists Becoming More Acute? Does the Minister Have Any New Information on This? (Answer) The Chongqing side decided at the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee to require the CCP to thoroughly implement the oath made in the 26th year of the Republic of China: to implement the Three People's Principles, to stop the policy of riots and redification, to abolish the red regime, and to dissolve the CCP army. It can be seen that the Chongqing side has finally openly expressed its intention to resolve the Chinese classical intention. In the Nanjing National Government's anti-classical peace and ancient building policy, only the anti-communist item has been implemented by the Chongqing side.

### The Revival of the National Economy

A nation's national economy is the lifeblood of the country. The wealth or poverty of the national economy reflects the strength or weakness of the country's lifeblood, and thus the power and influence of the nation. Therefore, among a country's policy guidelines, revitalizing the national economy is undoubtedly of paramount importance. To speak of "reviving" the national economy implies that it is already in a state of poverty, thus requiring revitalization, an effort to catch up, which has become a necessary step. It is undeniable that the current state of China's national economy is one of poverty, naturally requiring a revival to catch up.

In a conversation between Mr. Tajiri, the Minister of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, and Mr. Uchiyama, the owner of Uchiyama Bookstore, regarding the purchase of cotton yarn and fabric and the Chinese economy (reported on page 3 of this newspaper yesterday), it was suggested that the National Government should thoroughly implement price control measures, decisively dealing with hoarding, especially of yarn and fabric, to promote the revival of the Chinese national economy. The specific method should first facilitate the smooth exchange of goods between Shanghai and the inland areas and actively increase production. These are naturally sound principles. The tasks of the National Commercial Control Association—the operation, purchase, distribution, and production of materials—should be regarded as the circulation of blood, which cannot be stopped for even a moment. However, the current reality is that prices are constantly soaring. Although the Commercial Control Association has been established in name, blood is not circulating, so it has not yet been able to fulfill its original functions and gradually achieve its mission. In the future, considering price control and the tasks of the Commercial Control Association itself, there is a need to utilize this vast amount of material—yarn and fabric—and exert its functions. We share this view very much, and it can be said that it is the same as our consistent argument. Now, regarding the revival of the national economy, we will add some elaboration as follows:

First, the prerequisite for demanding the revival of the national economy lies in ensuring that people's lives are first stabilized. People prioritize the stability of their lives. If their lives are not stable, they will have to expend all their energy on securing their livelihoods, and they will not be able to think about issues beyond their basic needs. To be honest, the Chinese people are very gentle, their desires are simple, and their knowledge is limited. People who are struggling to feed themselves will not pretend to be patriotic or nationalistic. It is unrealistic to expect the government to encourage people to go hungry for the sake of saving the country. Unless people's lives are first stabilized, then they can be asked to cooperate in economic endeavors, which will proceed smoothly. Those in power must understand and grasp this fundamental psychology of the people.

Second, the most important aspect of the national economy is materials. With a complete plan for increasing the production and circulation of materials, which can be effectively implemented, prices will naturally return to normal. People's lives will naturally be easier to stabilize, and there will be confidence in the revival of the national economy.

Third, during this time of war, implementing a controlled economy system is not contrary to the revival of the national economy. If handled properly, it can directly stabilize people's livelihoods and indirectly lay the foundation for reviving the national economy. Therefore, the mission of the National Commercial Control Association is becoming more and more important, and its task is becoming more and more arduous. However, its only operating condition is materials. If materials cannot be controlled, it will be like blood not circulating, and the outcome will not be optimistic. Therefore, the revival of the national economy and the mission of the Commercial Control Association are closely related.

Fourth, the government's decision to purchase yarn and fabric this time is of great significance from the perspective of material circulation, and assigning it to the Commercial Control Association clearly strengthens the association's control over material operations. Although this may cause a major fluctuation in the economic world, it is an unavoidable measure in the effective implementation of a controlled economy. We believe that the government's decision should not be shaken in principle, and only appropriate remedies should be made from the side to gradually achieve the goals of the controlled economy policy.

Fifth, we have previously argued that the government should emphasize advance planning over after-the-fact remedies for all measures, reducing losses for both officials and the public. Especially in matters related to the national economy, they should be handled with great care in advance. The current decline in local prices proves that suppressing prices is not impossible. The government should immediately pay attention to this fact and consider the steps for full implementation. It should be noted that, in fact, there is no real general shortage of materials, but they are being hoarded by people and cannot be circulated. We hope that after the purchase of yarn and fabric, it will be circulated as soon as possible, and that ways will be found to circulate other materials as well. At the same time, actively promote production increase plans to ensure a continuous supply of materials. Prices are not impossible to suppress; it depends on having a comprehensive plan and resolute implementation. A controlled economy is not impossible to implement; it depends on using facts to make everyone understand that it is a beneficial system and cooperating in its implementation.

Sixth, observing calmly, because the price issue has evolved abnormally in recent years, most people have misconceptions. They subjectively speculate and worry about any economic measures of the government from a negative perspective, and thus naturally reveal an attitude of suspicion and disregard. They never pay attention to the positive aspects and adopt an attitude of cooperation and support. At the same time, those who seek exorbitant profits take advantage of opportunities to spread rumors, fueling public suspicion and satisfying their desire to profit. All of these are obstacles to the revival of the national economy. We hope that the government will pay attention to the reasons for this misconception and eliminate it with facts.

Finally, we believe that the power of economic institutions alone cannot completely save the economic crisis. They must be supplemented by political reforms in order for the economic institutions to exert their full effect. As Minister Tajiri said, strengthening the combination of Nanjing's politics and Shanghai's economy is the foundation for achieving economic revival. Only when economic reforms and political reforms are coordinated can the goal of reviving the national economy be achieved.

### American Losses Heavy in Air Raid on the Northern Kuril Islands; Enemy Aircraft Also Shot Down Over Vietnam and Burma

Northern Japan, Undisclosed Army Base, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced the other day that 18 American bombers attacked the Northern Kuril Islands on the morning of September 12th and were shot down 12 of their planes by Japanese aircraft. It turned out that Japanese fighters had detected the enemy aircraft raid early, and immediately took off from the base to launch a fierce attack on the enemy aircraft formation. The extremely skillful pilots even more bravely broke into the bomber formation and shot down many enemy aircraft one after another. The remaining enemy aircraft then fled north. The Japanese aircraft then pursued them urgently, launching a strong attack on them. The enemy aircraft could not withstand it and fled in panic towards the Soviet territory of Kamchatka.
