### Establishing a New Social Ethos

The decisive situation on every battlefield around the world is approaching day by day, and every belligerent nation feels the tension and is striving to unite, prepare, and economize in national life. Our nation is also in the ranks of the belligerents and is naturally in a tense situation. But what about our unity? What about our preparations? What about the mood of our national life? How do we compare to other wartime countries? If we hold up a mirror and examine ourselves, not intending to demean ourselves, we can't measure up in any way! Just taking national life as a comparison, we are already the opposite. Apart from the disaster areas of North China and the remote rural areas, which are restricted by the natural environment, other places, especially the cities, are still filled with a frivolous atmosphere; apart from the working masses and the salaried class, who are suppressed by high prices, other people, especially the idle class and the nouveau riche, are still full of extravagant habits, enjoying themselves when they can and being lavish where they can.

Some say that this is an exaggeration. Ordinary middle-class families used to be able to hire one or two servants to do laundry and cook, but now the masters and young ladies are carrying baskets and going to the vegetable market themselves; the wives and old ladies are also cooking, and they can talk about it openly without being ashamed. We also admit that this is a part of the reality, and it can be said to be a good sign of thrift. As the saying goes, "If you cherish your clothes, you will have clothes to wear; if you cherish your things, you will have things to use." The meaning is profound! But we say that this is certainly a good phenomenon, but it is not thorough enough. For example, wearing cloth clothes is certainly something one can be content with, but if one has a suit of serge to wear, one might feel that it is a cut above. Also, buying vegetables and cooking oneself is certainly considered normal, but if one's income becomes more abundant, one might still feel that hiring a servant is more comfortable. This is a lack of thoroughness in mentality. In addition, those who compete in extravagance are still the same as before. Even though banquets have risen to thousands of gold per table, and rouge and perfume have risen to hundreds of yuan per stick or bottle, they are still crowded, and sales are no different from the past. This is a lack of thoroughness in habits.

What is the reason why thrift cannot be thorough? The fundamental reason is that the thrift of some people is mostly due to the pressure of the economic environment, and their mentality is still inclined to comfort. In other words, the social ethos is still inclined to luxury. Because the social ethos has not changed, even some people with poor economic circumstances have to conform to the ethos and try to scrape together money to invite a table of guests, or reluctantly borrow dozens of yuan to attend other people's weddings and birthdays. The spread of this ethos makes the rich spend money even more recklessly, and makes the poor follow suit and spend money recklessly to save face. In these wartime circumstances, not only the government, but also public opinion, has tried many methods and wasted a lot of words to persuade the people to practice thrift, but the results have been minimal. For example, advocating that banquets should not exceed a certain amount per table, or a certain number of dishes, seems easy to say, but it is difficult to implement. The main key to this is still the ethos.

Therefore, we specifically put forward the proposition of establishing a new social ethos. We should reduce the old ethos that is not in line with the times, and step up the cultivation of the new ethos that is required by the times. Once it becomes a common practice, there is no need to resort to government laws and regulations to supervise or social opinion to promote it. Naturally, everyone will agree and follow suit. The power of the ethos is really too great! We must all quickly learn to use it well.

In terms of thrift, we hope to take advantage of this wartime period to sweep away the old ethos of extravagance and frivolity, and establish a new ethos of thrift and simplicity. In particular, we must undergo a thorough change in mentality, and not temporarily change due to the economic environment. We must make everyone regard cloth clothes and old clothes as glorious, and fancy clothes and grand attire as excessive; regard vegetarian meals and light meals as glorious, and sumptuous dishes and delicacies as excessive; regard walking and manual labor as a symbol of health, and riding in a car and hiring servants as a sign of old age and uselessness; regard light gifts as fulfilling one's obligations, and heavy gifts as abnormal; regard cherishing public property as a virtue, and wasting public property as disgusting. This should not only be the case in wartime, but also lay a solid foundation for establishing a new ethos from now on. We can foresee that after the war, the country will be scarred and everything will need to be rebuilt. It will take ten years of hard work to build a modern nation. The Japanese and Germans are united in living a hard life, saving materials, and dedicating them to the country. Even the Soviet Union, although we do not approve of its ideology, its promotion of three five-year plans, with the people of the whole country economizing and supporting the country, is indeed commendable. The thrifty style of these countries, both during and after the war, is worthy of emulation by our 450 million people. What we hope to establish in a new social ethos is not just thrift. For example, changing the style of writing and creating a vigorous new spirit are also urgent needs of the times. The special emphasis on establishing a thrifty and simple atmosphere is because it is the most basic and necessary change, and is given as an example for illustration.

To promote the establishment and implementation of a thrifty ethos, we also suggest that social organizations should jointly take the lead in holding thrift practice weeks, in order to carry out further practical activities and arouse the attention of all sectors. The practices that should be included in the thrift week include at least the following points:

(1) Strive to work diligently in the office to save time. Use all stationery and supplies without wasting them in the slightest to save materials.

(2) When meeting guests and visiting friends, state the matters for negotiation directly and quickly, reducing perfunctory and empty talk, and saving time.

(3) When going out on business, walk if you can.

(4) If a banquet is necessary, use the simplest dishes and home-cooked meals, and be sure not to waste them.

(5) Do not wear fancy clothes, and do not buy expensive clothing materials.

(6) Do not perm your hair, and do not use expensive cosmetics.

(7) Do not buy first-class tickets.

The most important thing is that the meaning of holding a thrift week is to take this opportunity to arouse the attention of all sectors, and then continue to practice it forever. It is not like performing a drama. When wearing the costume, the performance is earth-shattering and serious. Once the costume is taken off and the performance is over, it returns to its original appearance. Then why bother to do it?

An article entitled "Food in North China Relief" by Mr. Zhang Yipeng, published in the "Weekly Review" on the 12th of this month, mentioned the "Baofeng" plant studied by Mr. Zhu Huai. According to Mr. Zhu's letter, there are three corrections:

(1) "Baofeng" was originally named "pou-feng", formerly "pon-feng" in error.

(2) Carbohydrates include starch, sugar, and fiber. If carbohydrates are listed in the table, there is no need to list the last three items.

(3) The true situation of this plant and its correct scientific name are still under study and investigation.

### Japanese Planes Attack Russell Island Again Fierce Air Battles Ensue 150 Fighters Participate Result: 33 Enemy Planes Shot Down

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM today: On June 12th, the Imperial Navy's air force launched another large-scale air raid on Russell Island in the Solomon Islands and engaged dozens of enemy aircraft, shooting down 33 of them. Five of our aircraft have not returned.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - It is reported that the U.S. Navy Department announced on the 13th: On June 12th, the Japanese air force engaged in an air battle with the U.S. Air Force over Russell Island in the Solomon Islands. As a result, the U.S. Air Force lost six aircraft.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - From the first Solomon Sea battle in August of last year to June 12th of this year, the number of enemy aircraft shot down and destroyed by the Japanese Army and Navy air forces and ground forces in the South Pacific, including those announced by the General Headquarters this time, totals 2,383, of which 2,109 were shot down and 274 were destroyed.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Navy air force launched a large-scale air raid on Russell Island on June 7th, shooting down 49 enemy aircraft and achieving great results. Now, the Japanese General Headquarters announced again on the 14th that the Japanese air force attacked the island again on the 12th, shooting down another 33 enemy aircraft. It can be seen that the aerial decisive battle between Japan and the United States in the South Pacific is becoming increasingly fierce. According to reports, the Japanese Navy air force flew over Russell Island on the morning of the 12th. At that time, 70 enemy fighters were waiting in the air over the island, forming a favorable formation to intercept the Japanese air force. The Japanese Navy air force immediately launched an attack in the middle, and about 150 fighters from both sides engaged in a fierce dogfight for about 30 minutes. Although the enemy's formation was superior to the Japanese side, they did not adopt an active fighting method from the beginning, but only fought with a passive escape method. This is significantly different from the fierce attacking spirit of the Japanese Navy air force. The Japanese Navy air force shot down 33 enemy aircraft in this air battle, which is almost half of their total. The Japanese side also lost five aircraft. According to the enemy's announcement, they only lost six aircraft in this air battle. This is nothing more than concealing the damage they suffered in an attempt to deceive their own people and the people of the world.

### Spring Campaign Objectives Achieved Japanese Forces in Hunan and Hubei Score Gains

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch)

According to a dispatch from a certain front in Hunan, the spring offensive launched by the Japanese army this time can be said to have dealt a fatal blow to the Chongqing side. After the three-day battle was completed, a certain Japanese army unit returned to its original defense. After this offensive, the 17th Division, the elite unit secretly hidden by the Chongqing side, has been completely lost. Therefore, in order to restore the declining situation and for the sake of external propaganda, the Chongqing army attempted to counterattack on the 4th of this month in the three directions of Yidu West Gate and Tudi, but was counterattacked by the Japanese army and retreated. It is estimated that from the 4th to the 9th of this month, in just one week, the new elite units of the Chongqing army, the 74th, 79th, and 44th armies, each with two divisions, totaling 60,000 troops, were completely wiped out. When the Japanese army launched the annihilation battle on the banks of Dongting Lake on May 5th, they first broke through the enemy's 19th Group Army. Later, in the battle in the northern area of Jinshi and Lixian, they defeated the Chongqing 10th Group Army. This was followed by this counter-offensive operation. Therefore, a total of 23 divisions of the Chongqing army were annihilated, reaching 23 divisions, and the Chongqing army's attempt to counterattack was completely crushed.

Hankou, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch)

On the 8th and 9th of this month, they besieged the 2nd Division of the 94th Army of Chongqing near Dameng Tudi, achieving great results. After a certain part of the Japanese army began to transfer, the Chongqing side transferred the 171st and 162nd divisions of the 44th Army (Commander Wang Zetan) in an attempt to move to the south of Huarong and the south of Anxiang County. On the morning of the 4th, they entered Ganjiachang, southwest of Ouchikou, and on the 7th, they arrived at Dameng Tudi and Niulanghu (southwest of Shishou), and attempted to act rashly. The Japanese army unit remained calm, completed preparations, and began operations simultaneously on the 8th in three directions: east, west, and north, advancing from the northwest. Because the Japanese army launched a fierce attack near Hejiatan (30 li west of Ouchikou) and Ganjiachang at 2:00 PM on the 8th, about 1,000 soldiers of the Chongqing 162nd Division, carrying mortars, responded to the Japanese army advancing from the east, west, and north, and attacked Dameng Tudi Qingshibei (25 kilometers southwest of Ouchikou), and completed the encirclement with Dameng Tudi as the center. 20,000 soldiers of the Chongqing 162nd Division and 150th Division attempted to break through, but were attacked by the Japanese army again at night, and were finally completely defeated by the Japanese army at dawn on the 9th.

It is expected that Thailand's decisive battle system has been further strengthened. What are the measures taken by the Thai government?

It is not only Thailand's own problem, but also has the great significance of building a wing of the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. Asked, In order to thoroughly win the Greater East Asia War, the cooperation between Japan and Thailand must be further strengthened. What are the specific strategies of the Prime Minister for Japanese-Thai cooperation?

### Japanese Engineers in New Guinea Display Combat Spirit: Form Suicide Squad, Infiltrate Jungle, Successfully Launch Surprise Attack on Enemy Artillery Positions

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency)

The front pages of various newspapers here today all published an article by Mr. Nagai, head of the Army Press Corps, describing how 29 Japanese army engineers were ordered to destroy enemy artillery positions in the dense jungles of New Guinea. It detailed the soldiers' spirit of overcoming all difficulties, infiltrating enemy vehicle positions, destroying enemy heavy artillery positions, and completing their great mission, which was quite moving. The gist is as follows: On the morning of the 23rd of a certain month at 8:00 AM, the Japanese army's Kitajima Company was ordered to attack enemy artillery positions. The order included instructing the unit to form a melee assault team to urgently attack the enemy artillery positions in front of Kiruwa, and to form five melee assault teams, each led by an officer, to infiltrate the enemy front lines or behind enemy lines to search for and attack enemy artillery positions. After receiving this order, Lieutenant Kitajima, the company commander, carefully considered it and selected 29 determined and physically strong volunteers to form a melee assault team, led by Cadet Officer Yoshio Ishida. Amidst the explosions of artillery shells, they shook hands with the company commander and their comrades, and Cadet Officer Ishida led them enthusiastically on their way, crossing the dense jungle towards their destination. Around 7:00 PM on the 23rd, they arrived at a location about four kilometers from the enemy artillery positions. However, because both sides of the Soputa to Kiruwa highway were wetlands with dense and gloomy trees, and aside from two or three small paths connecting to the Kiruwa highway, the entire area was a remote and uninhabited wilderness. To be cautious, the team infiltrated the dense jungle, detoured to the enemy's rear, and launched a surprise attack. Everyone carried explosives, handguns, and hand grenades, and prepared a week's worth of food, groping their way forward. In the dense jungle, even during the day, it was as dark as night, so night travel was impossible. Using a compass and the sound of enemy artillery as their targets, they estimated their direction and advanced. On the 24th, they suddenly lost their way and wandered in the dense jungle all day. It was not until the 25th that they found the road again. The team re-entered the dense jungle and continued to advance, enduring great hardship. Unfortunately, the team leader, Cadet Officer Ishida, was killed in action midway, and the attack team's senior sergeant was also seriously wounded, so the situation was somewhat unfavorable. However, the team continued to advance with an indomitable spirit, and publicly elected First Squad Leader Sergeant Yamamoto as commander, vowing to advance to the death and avenge their fallen team leader. They continued their assault with the determination that when the unit commander fell, the leader would take over, when the leader fell, the team leader would take over, and when the team leader fell, the soldiers would take over, until the last soldier. After bidding farewell to the body of the fallen assault team leader and the seriously wounded sergeant, First Squad Leader Sergeant Yamamoto, under the expectations of the crowd, took over the command of the entire group, uniting their hearts and minds and strengthening their solidarity. Together, they re-entered the enemy artillery positions amidst a rain of bullets, advancing towards their designated target. On the 27th, they reached a point one kilometer from the enemy artillery positions, but they absolutely could not let the enemy discover them, otherwise all their actions would be hindered. Therefore, Sergeant Yamamoto led the entire group in secret advance, holding firm to the determination of "Not entering the tiger's den, how can one seize the tiger's cubs?" They finally infiltrated behind the enemy positions. They then sent three soldiers to sneak into the grass and thoroughly scout the enemy's position, learning that the enemy's artillery positions were built in grass that was over ten feet high, with the artillery bodies all hidden by the grass. They saw that there were six artillery positions, and two large tents were built between the rear and the platform. Opposite the platform, there was a large tent that looked like a headquarters, and there were leftover dishes and lunch boxes, but no enemy soldiers were seen. The brave Japanese soldiers immediately recorded the deployment of the enemy's positions in detail. After the three men completed their reconnaissance, they returned to the original place. Sergeant Yamamoto then reviewed the map in detail with all the members, and at the same time pointed out the bombing targets. They then separately designated each group to bomb six enemy artillery pieces. After receiving the orders, each group broke out of the jungle and advanced to the grassland, approaching to within about 500 meters of the enemy artillery positions. In a flash of light, enemy artillery thundered, and bullets shot out like a storm, but they crawled forward through the grass on their backs, charging into the enemy positions. After a while, the sound of enemy artillery gradually weakened, and they sneaked into the enemy's camp, believing that the opportunity to attack had arrived. They then crept to a stop 20 meters in front of the enemy, each group preparing and quietly waiting for Sergeant Yamamoto's order. After a while, the sound of bullets ceased and daylight reappeared. Sergeant Yamamoto immediately issued an assault order, and everyone stepped through the grass, rushing in like flying. But unfortunately, their actions had been discovered by the enemy, and the enemy soldiers guarding the position fired wildly with automatic rifles from the grass on the right and from behind the position on the left. However, the command squad, which had bypassed the enemy's guard under Sergeant Yamamoto's orders, came out to respond. The first group also threw explosives, breaking through the enemy's rightmost artillery position and circling around to the vicinity of the enemy's tents. They saw lights burning in the tents, and thirty or forty Australian soldiers gathered there. Sergeant Yamamoto then ordered the bombing of the two enemy artillery pieces in front of them. With a deafening roar, the two heavy artillery pieces were instantly shattered. At the same time, they threw bombs at the tents, killing thirty or forty Australian soldiers, and then destroyed two enemy artillery pieces on the side. The enemy soldiers, startled by the three loud explosions, rushed out of the nearby tents, responding with automatic rifles and hand grenades. The two sides then engaged in a melee, followed by several loud metallic sounds from the enemy artillery positions, indicating that several more enemy artillery pieces had been destroyed. At this time, the third group also attacked the designated enemy artillery positions. The enemy fired fiercely with automatic rifles, but they continued to crawl forward. Near the enemy positions, they rushed to the muzzles of the artillery pieces and quickly threw explosives, destroying six enemy artillery pieces, silencing the enemy artillery that had been displaying its power for days. Although they lost their commander on the way, they remained unyielding, uniting under the command of a sergeant and completing their great mission with a spirit of fearless bravery. The spirit of the Japanese army engineers has truly been demonstrated.

### Britain Attempts to Invade Sicily: Frequent Activity in Gibraltar, Germany Builds Strong Defenses Along the Coast, Enemy Ships in the Mediterranean Subjected to Fierce Attacks by German Aircraft

Lariña, 14th (Central News Agency) - Haisong News Agency: There has been significant activity in Gibraltar in recent days. According to reliable sources, 450 British technical workers arrived there yesterday to accelerate the underground construction project that has been underway for several months. Coastal artillery positions have also been built, and special protection facilities have been put in place, controlled by a single electrical switch. In addition, 43 British landing craft and five large tugboats arrived in Gibraltar yesterday, rumored to be sent to North Africa in preparation for the invasion of Sicily. Currently, only 26 merchant ships are anchored in the port of Gibraltar, with three of them undergoing repairs.

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - Major Freitag, an air force reporter for the German News Agency, declared that on Saturday, German heavy bombers intensified their air strikes on the Strait of Sicily and the sea near Pantelleria, bombing the port facilities on the island and the ships anchored nearby, focusing particularly on a few large warships and special landing flat-bottomed boats. Many were directly hit and damaged, including a large armored landing craft, which sank immediately after being hit. In the second German air strike, at least 12 more landing craft in the British and American transport fleets were hit and sunk. In the evening, only the heavy bomber squadrons attacked a British fleet near Lampedusa. Although the British anti-aircraft artillery fiercely resisted, six warships were still hit, one of which exploded violently after being hit. In order to ensure accurate bombing, German aircrews flew very low. The most successful attack was the German bomber squadron's night attack on the port of Bizerte, because the British and Americans had not only docked many large warships there, but also concentrated a large number of landing craft. At least 20 of these were sunk by German aircraft. Only one German aircraft failed to return.

Europe's Fortress is Solid as a Rock: British Newspaper Admits Invasion is Not Easy

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - Haisong News Agency: The British "Economic Weekly" stated that Europe's fortress is solid as a rock and must be broken at a significant sacrifice. Although destructive actions are occasionally found in Europe, most people are still working peacefully, fulfilling their duties. German officials in various parts of Europe travel and work without difficulty. The mobilization of foreign manpower has undoubtedly been successful for the Germans, and Germany has now obtained the workers it needs. Moreover, Germany's anti-Bolshevik military operations have not failed. The effects of the Allied air strikes may be exaggerated. The main target of the British and Americans is the Ruhr region, but the industry in that region represents less than one-fifth of Germany's total industrial capacity, and the coal and steel produced in that region only account for one-third of Germany's total industry. Germany's defense industries are located in areas further east, including the new steel mill in Salzgitter, the largest tank factory in Fallersleben, the chemical plant in Leuna, the synthetic rubber industry in the Sudetenland, and new factories in Upper Silesia and southern Poland. Therefore, concentrated bombing is unlikely to achieve the desired results. Germany's fighting power and morale have not collapsed. Strong defenses have been built along the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts and equipped with heavy artillery.

### British Fleet Commander Cunningham Visits Ankara

Ankara, 14th (Central News Agency) - Admiral Cunningham, commander of the British Eastern Mediterranean Fleet, arrived in Ankara yesterday by plane. He intends to visit the Turkish Chief of General Staff, Prime Minister Saracoğlu, Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu, and the leaders of the Turkish Navy.

Ankara, 13th (Central News Agency) - Haisong News Agency: Rear Admiral Sir Cunningham, the newly appointed British naval commander of the Eastern Mediterranean, will be here from Saturday to Tuesday. It is not yet known when he will be received by the Turkish President. It is expected that the discussions between British officials and Turkish military authorities will not be made public. According to political figures here, the discussions will be about the transportation of various raw materials granted to Turkey by the British and Americans from southern Anatolia to the northwestern ports of that province. For this reason, the anti-Axis countries will allow Turkey to use cargo ships.

### British and American Aircraft Attack Germany: Loss of Thirty-Nine Aircraft

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - The British Air Ministry announced on the 13th that the British bomber squadrons lost 24 aircraft during the bombing of the industrial city of Bochum in western Germany on the 12th.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - Major Freitag, an air force reporter for the German News Agency, stated that on Sunday, 15 American heavy bombers were shot down by German anti-aircraft artillery while attempting to attack Kiel and Bremen. Although the American aircraft approached the coast at high altitude, they were discovered by the Germans over the North Sea and effectively attacked before reaching their targets. Therefore, most of the American aircraft were forced to drop their bombs into the sea or the wilderness. A few aircraft that reached Kiel and Bremen could only drop bombs randomly in two places, and only residential areas were damaged.

London, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to today's Reuters report, the Allies lost a total of 101 aircraft in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East during the past week. The most aircraft were lost during the night attacks on Düsseldorf and Münster in Germany on Friday night and the night attack on Bochum on Saturday. This number includes eight American aircraft.

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from London: The British Air Ministry announced on the 14th that the German Air Force bombed the London area on the night of the 13th, while another squadron bombed various cities on the southwestern coast, which suffered considerable damage and casualties. The German Air Force continued to bomb the northeastern coastal areas of the British mainland on the morning of the 14th.

### Britain Mobilizes Thirty-Two Million Men

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Allied Intelligence Committee announced on the 13th that the mobilized forces of the Allied countries, including 32,250,000 men from Britain itself, of whom 22,250,000 are directly or indirectly engaged in the war due to mobilization and conscription.

### Polish Leader Visits Iraq

Ankara, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to Haisong News Agency: General Sikorski, leader of the London-based government-in-exile and commander-in-chief of the Polish army, has arrived in Baghdad as a guest of the Iraqi government. Upon his arrival, representatives of the Iraqi government, as well as senior American and Polish officials stationed in Iraq, were present to welcome him.

### Italian Politician Comments on Italy's Future in the War: Difficulties Were Expected Long Ago, Determined to Strive for Final Victory

Stockholm, 14th (Central News Agency) - Stefani News Agency reports that Essen, a famous political problem expert, wrote an article in the newspaper commenting on Italy's participation in the war, saying that Italy had great difficulty in maintaining neutrality in this war. The most natural way for Western countries to attack Germany is through Italy, so Italy has no choice but to join the battle, otherwise it will sit and wait for defeat. Mussolini obviously did not expect to easily win in a short period of time. When Italy declared war, Mussolini knew that the plutocratic countries would inevitably oppose Italy's desire to achieve a position that conformed to the greatness of the Italian nation and its desire for Italy's security. For many years, Mussolini has not imagined that Italy's path would be easy. Italy's declaration of war on the plutocratic countries has proven that, from any point of view, Italy's fate must be determined by war. Even if Italy maintains neutrality, if the Western countries win, Italy will inevitably lose its status as a great power and will not be able to exist in a tolerable situation. Italy has chosen the only path that any other great power could choose in the same circumstances, between remaining a great power or becoming a vassal. On the third anniversary of Italy's participation in the war, coinciding with the country's most serious period in modern history, this was not unexpected by Mussolini and the Italian government. The difficulties of this war were expected long ago, but Italy's situation is not as critical as many people think. Italy's spiritual resources have been mobilized on an unprecedented scale, and Italy's will and strength to resist may still shock the world. What will happen in the future is not necessary to speculate. The Axis powers may attack Sardinia and Sicily one after another, but it is currently impossible to attempt to attack the Italian mainland. Here, Italy's enemies will encounter enormous difficulties and may suffer a disastrous defeat. The turning point of the war may be here. Italy, under the current circumstances, does not hesitate between retreating or being determined to win. The Italians have decided to strive for victory. Mussolini's words "We will surely return" come from the hearts of the Italians. Those who think that Italy is not prepared to experience difficulties must know that the decisions of most wars are not due to accidental material superiority, but due to spiritual factors. In this struggle, the spiritual factor is on Italy's side.

### Zoot Suit Riots in California, USA

Buenos Aires, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Los Angeles: A conflict occurred here on the 10th between zoot suit gangs and American soldiers, which later spread to various cities in southern California. The authorities have begun active investigations. On the 12th, a large-scale brawl occurred again in Los Angeles, in which the zoot suit gangs joined forces with members of the Women's Auxiliary Corps, targeting American army and navy soldiers and marines. A major melee broke out, resulting in many injuries. The state authorities, unable to cope with the continuous riots in various parts of California, intervened to mediate between the two sides. However, in the past week, the number of people slightly or seriously injured or killed due to the riots has reached 125, which has in fact become a major social problem.

### Japan's Naval Battles and the Battle of Jutland (Part 2)

— Masanori Ito

(4) Superiority of Naval Mine Night Battles

Even after sinking about 80% of the enemy's main battleships during the main artillery battle on May 27th, Marshal Togo was not satisfied with this overwhelming victory. He still believed it was necessary to annihilate one first-class battleship, three second-line battleships, three heavy cruisers, six light cruisers, three coastal defense ships, and nine destroyers that were damaged and attempting to flee to Vladivostok. Commander Togo had already prepared this plan, which was the so-called "Seven Combined Battles" plan. The first battle was the main artillery battle, the second was the naval mine night battle, the third was the main artillery battle the following day, and the fourth was the main artillery night battle. Attacks were to be continued in this order, with the aim of sinking all the enemy ships by the fourth day. The second battle began at 7:30 PM on the 27th. The 1st Destroyer Squadron, 2nd Destroyer Squadron, and 3rd Torpedo Boat Unit from the north, and the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Destroyer Squadrons from the east, and the 1st, 10th, 15th, 17th, and 20th Torpedo Boat Squadrons from the south, surrounded the remaining enemy fleet from three sides and engaged in close-quarters combat. The enemy, led by the battleship "Nikolai I," divided ten ships into two rows and sped north, encountering intense attacks from our three naval mine squadrons. The battleship "Navarin" was sunk, and the battleships "Sisoi Veliky" and "Admiral Nakhimov" were severely damaged (both sinking the following morning), with losses of this magnitude.

The main fleet, hindered by twilight, withdrew from the battlefield at 7:20 PM, but the naval mine battle had already begun at 7:30 PM. The enemy, encountering our thorough plan and lightning-fast pursuit, did not have a moment's respite. As night deepened, they thought they could rest a little, but this sweet dream lasted only ten minutes, which was truly pathetic. However, this naval mine battle was launched recklessly in the vast ocean with waves over ten feet high. Our hundred-ton torpedo boats were rocking and rolling at sixty degrees. In such turbulence, the compass was virtually useless, the soldiers on board were completely soaked in water, and the telescopes were completely blurred by a layer of water vapor, making navigation nearly impossible. However, forty small ships, with the determination to die alongside the enemy's large ships, rapidly approached, and after four hours of repeated attacks, they achieved the aforementioned great results.

Originally, naval mine night battles were one of the special strengths of the Japanese Navy, but the reason for this so-called special strength was the brave determination to die alongside the enemy. Although there were technical differences between the Japanese and British naval mine squadrons in the Battle of Jutland, their spirit of bravery and skillful fighting was incomparably different.

(5) Confidence and Terror in Night Battles

The difference in soldiers was certainly a factor, but the main difference was the fundamental difference in the commanders. Jellicoe, at 9:00 PM (the light intensity was the same as in the Sea of Japan at 7:30 PM), ordered his destroyer fleet to line up five miles behind the main fleet, in case the German naval mine squadron launched torpedoes from behind. The British naval mine squadron's awareness of the German main fleet was due to accidental contact and acted according to Jellicoe's intentions. In contrast, Marshal Togo never thought of using the naval mine squadron to protect himself during the Battle of the Sea of Japan, but always ordered the naval mine squadron to desperately launch torpedoes at the enemy.

Most importantly, "night battle," from the Marshal's perspective, was a necessary means of annihilation, and he adopted it with great expectation and confidence. Jellicoe, on the other hand, believed that night battle was a risky fighting method against the enemy and used excuses to avoid it. He had a saying, "Very Largely matter of chance," which has already been introduced in the description of the naval battle. What war is there if you lose "Chance"? Furthermore, his words reveal a very womanish and childish excuse. We will translate a section from his book "Grand Fleet" to prove this.

"The German naval organization is outstanding for night battles. Their identification signals are particularly good. Ours are almost nonexistent. Their searchlights are stronger than ours. The last argument is that their nighttime gunnery is extremely skilled (referring to their aiming and firing speed). I believe we must learn from the German Navy regarding night battles."

In this way, the naval battle between Germany and Britain was simply a contest between teacher and student, so there was no hope of victory even in ten thousand attempts. This was the reason why Jellicoe did not engage in night battles. He believed that the enemy was so capable and skillful that he feared them even in a full-scale battle. Not underestimating the enemy can be considered an advantage of the British Navy.

Why was there such a great difference between Marshal Togo and Jellicoe? During the Battle of the Sea of Japan, among the first-class ships of the two armies, Japan had four and Russia had five, and four of Russia's five ships, such as the "Oslyabya," "Emperor Alexander III," "Knyaz Suvorov," and "Oryol," were superior in performance to Japan's "Mikasa" (at the time, Russia's four ships were the most excellent in the world). Foreign critics had already pointed this out, but Marshal Togo never mentioned this point. He only thought about completely defeating these warships. There is naturally a world of difference in character between a general who is determined to completely defeat the enemy and a general who allows the enemy to escape completely.

(6) German Admiral Also Revealed the Truth

Evading the main night battle would be a trivial matter, but having over seventy destroyers to provide an advantage and not carrying out a night attack is a very incomprehensible mystery. German Fleet Commander Admiral Scheer, after 9:00 PM, secretly pondered that he had to break through the British fleet with the main battleships and head straight to his base, but he was also worried about night battles. Scheer said in his Battle of Jutland diary:

"If the enemy attacks our army with their powerful main force in the evening twilight, and then uses destroyers to carry out a naval mine night attack, then it will force our fleet to steer further west, and materially force us to engage in battle the next day. He clearly has this power of execution."

Jellicoe was the one who had this power of execution but did not execute it. Admiral Scheer carefully guarded against that power of execution, but the British unexpectedly did not engage in night attacks, and avoided night battles, so Scheer's fleet received such an unexpected gain and returned safely to its base.

But Jellicoe's avoidance of night battles is equivalent to automatically giving up a heaven-sent opportunity for victory. This is as clear as the sun and moon in anyone's eyes. However, the British naval bulletin said, "The Commander-in-Chief decided very rightly ont to fight nignt action." In reality, the Commander-in-Chief evaded night battles, and only this judgment is appropriate, but evading night battles was praised as being correct. If they had not praised it and simply described it, it would have been the end of it, but praising it as very appropriate means that the British Admiralty cannot avoid sharing some responsibility for the strategic error. In short, the foundation of their strategic thinking is safety first, which is acceptable in exercises, but this kind of thinking cannot be held in actual combat. If Marshal Togo were Jellicoe, he would have done the exact opposite.

The heroic posture of the enemy's Marshal standing on the deck during the Battle of the Sea of Japan is a war photograph that all Japanese people must see at least once. However, a painting of Jellicoe, calm and composed in the 13-inch command tower of the "Iron Duke," cannot be seen anywhere in Britain. There is truly a reason for this.

### Director Iwazaki Gave a Banquet for the Press Yesterday Afternoon

Colonel Harushige Iwazaki, Director of the Press Department of the Japanese Military Dispatch Headquarters in China and Director of the Press Department of the Japanese Army Department in Shanghai, was transferred to an important position. The central propaganda agencies in Shanghai, the local press, and the cultural community jointly held a farewell banquet for him a few days ago. Director Iwazaki then went to Beijing to prepare everything. On the 13th, he took a train from Beijing to Shanghai and held a banquet at 12:30 PM yesterday (the 14th) on the 9th floor of the Cathay Hotel to thank the local propaganda agencies, the press, and the cultural community. The situation was grand and enthusiastic. The details are as follows:

Guests Arrived: A grand banquet was held on time. Director Iwazaki personally led his colleagues Lieutenant Colonel Shio, Major Yamaga, Trustee Akahoshi, Trustee Ota, etc., and warmly thanked and advised the representatives of the central propaganda offices in Shanghai and the local news media. Those who were invited and attended included Feng Jie, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department, Secretary Ma Zongyao, Tang Liangli, Director of the International Propaganda Bureau, Li Zhaozhi, Director of the Zhong Youcai Electrical Inspection Association, Xu Liqiu, Yan Jiabao, and Lei Zhenyuan of the China Daily, Chen Binhe of the Shen Bao, Yuan Shu, Weng Yongqing, and Lu Feng of the Xin Zhongguo Bao, Kiyomasa Hidakamo of the New Shen Bao, Lu Guangjie of the Ping Bao, Zheng Hongyan and Cheng Zhongquan of the Xinwen Bao, Zong Jingze and Zhu Yongkang of the Guomin Xinwen, Wu Peizhi, Yang Huilang, and Gan Nailiang of the Shanghai Branch of the Central News Agency, Ren Yunpeng of the Shanghai News Federation, Zheng Yu'an of the Zhonghua Daobao, and Huang Tianshi of the China Film United Company, etc. During the banquet, Director Iwazaki first gave a speech, followed by Director Feng, who stood up on behalf of everyone to express his gratitude. They raised their glasses to wish each other well. The banquet ended at 2:30 PM in the afternoon, with the guests and hosts enjoying themselves.

Iwazaki's Speech: Director Iwazaki said in his speech, "As I am about to leave Shanghai, I am hosting this small gathering to show my sincere gratitude for everyone's past assistance. I am very happy to receive your messages of condolence and congratulations. I have been working in China for two and a half years and I am grateful for your assistance, which has enabled me to complete my duties. I would like to express my gratitude. However, after I leave, the reporting work in Shanghai will be handled by Lieutenant Colonel Shio. I hope that you will continue to assist Lieutenant Colonel Shio as you have assisted me in the past and work together to promote the mission. The current situation is becoming increasingly serious, and the duties of reporting are becoming increasingly difficult. In order to overcome all difficulties, we must work twice as hard to complete the mission successfully as soon as possible. Finally, I wish you all good health and a bright future."

Representative's Reply: Director Feng Jie replied on behalf of everyone, saying, "When the news of Director Iwazaki's promotion was announced, all parties in Shanghai expressed their infinite regret. The propaganda agencies, the press, and the cultural community in Shanghai held a grand farewell party. Before taking office, Director Iwazaki has given us another opportunity to talk and entertain us today. I cannot express in a few words the expectations of Director Iwazaki and the difficult-to-give-up enthusiasm. Everyone present has received assistance from Director Iwazaki during his tenure to carry out his mission. On the day of the previous farewell banquet, we were filled with the sadness of parting, and today we are still so. The Director just said that the situation is serious, and we should do our best to work twice as hard to live up to the Director's wishes. I now feel that today's departure is not a farewell, but the beginning of a gathering, because he has completed the first half of his mission in China and Greater East Asia. He first engaged in the integration of propaganda agencies related to China and provided assistance to them, so that the second half of his mission is our hope that the Director will give us assistance again after taking office. I firmly believe that he will give us greater assistance in the future. During the Director's tenure, Lieutenant Colonel Shio, Major Yamaga, and his colleagues have all made the same efforts as the Director. The Director just announced that Lieutenant Colonel Shio will be in charge, and we are all very happy to hear this. Lieutenant Colonel Shio is one of the people who follows the Japanese spirit and understands the Director best, and we have been working with Lieutenant Colonel Shio for a long time and know that he is a person who is familiar with Chinese learning and history and the ideals of Greater East Asia. We will not disappoint the Director's expectations, and we will cooperate sincerely with Lieutenant Colonel Shio to shoulder our responsibilities. I wish the Director all the best and welcome Lieutenant Colonel Shio."

The Japanese Report was Broadcast at 6:20 PM

### Police and Baojia Authorities Inspect Citizen Certificates

In order to promote the highest performance of the public security system, the police and baojia authorities in the city and the two concession areas are now stepping up the inspection of citizen certificates or identity cards to prevent unscrupulous elements from using counterfeit or unreleased identity documents to mix into the jurisdiction and engage in illegal activities. The police and baojia personnel are paying attention to travelers entering and leaving trains and harbors and pedestrians on the streets, and even checking households. If they find that the passes and identity cards carried by the detained persons are suspicious, or if they do not carry any documents, they will be immediately interrogated. Therefore, citizens who go out frequently must carry their identity cards with them to avoid unnecessary trouble.

### Sponsoring the Repair of Huang Daichi's Tomb

— Liu Haisu

After experiencing many hardships, on the 10th of this month, I was invited by Mr. Binhe to a drink, where I met my old friend Wu Hufan. Overjoyed at our reunion, the first thing he told me was about the discovery of Huang Daichi's tomb and asked me to jointly initiate its repair and restoration. Huang Gongwang (1269-1355), also known as Zijiǔ, Yifeng, and Daichi Daoren, was a well-known master of the Southern School. His paintings had two styles: one in light green, with a powerful brushstroke; the other in ink wash, with extremely sparse techniques. He drew inspiration from Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, and Ju Ran from a distance, and from Li Cheng of Yingqiu and Fan Kuan of Huayuan from nearby. He swept away the paintings of the Han, Jin, Six Dynasties, Tang, and Song dynasties, focusing on expressing the landscape in his heart. He found joy in life through his serene and simple brushstrokes. It is said that the ancients found pleasure in painting, and this started with Daichi. He was truly a master of the art world, and the repair of his tomb cannot be delayed. In addition to donating one thousand yuan myself, I have also asked Dr. Ding Shikang to donate one thousand yuan as an initiative. I have traveled extensively in Europe, visiting famous cities such as Rome, Paris, London, and Berlin. Europeans hold the remains and tombs of art giants in high esteem, building magnificent structures for posterity to pay their respects. For example, Raphael's coffin and the coffin of Victor Emmanuel II, the founder of Italy, are both housed in the Pantheon in Rome (the national burial ground), showing great respect. Daichi's art is unparalleled throughout history. Now that my friend Hufan has made this enlightening discovery, all artists and art lovers should rally to support it.

### A Record of the Modern Japanese Painting Exhibition

— Liu Hanru

The "Modern Japanese Painting Exhibition" organized by the Japan International Culture Promotion Association opened yesterday (the 14th) at the Da Hsin Art Gallery with a preview, inviting guests from all sectors of the city to participate. The public exhibition will run from today until the 20th, with free admission.

A month ago, the Japan Imperial Art Association held a Japanese painting exhibition at the Pudong Fellow Association building on Avenue Edward VII in this city. While there were some excellent works among the exhibits, they did not match the brilliance of this Modern Japanese Painting Exhibition. Furthermore, the works in the Japan Imperial Art Association exhibition were priced for sale, while the Modern Japanese Painting Exhibition aims to promote artistic exchange between China and Japan and enhance the feelings between the two nations. The exhibits are absolutely not for sale, so the two exhibitions have completely different purposes.

All the works on display at the New Art Gallery, about 70 in total, are excellent pieces by first-class Japanese masters. The variety is dazzling and the beauty is endless. Based on personal preference, the most exquisite pieces include the following:

(1) No. 24, "Little Dew," by Domoto Insho, uses ink and light color to depict autumn scenery, maple leaves, bamboo, a child, and a temple. The composition is skillful, the brushstrokes are free, and the autumn wind seems to whisper.

(2) No. 3, "Autumn Clearing in a Mountain Village," by Kawai Gyokudo. Like the previous piece, it depicts autumn scenery, but the brushstrokes and materials have their own characteristics. The composition is particularly elegant and serene, with Western painting colors. The bamboo is depicted very delicately, retaining the ancient style. The combination of trees and bamboo is harmonious. Reading this painting is like tasting mellow wine, while reading the previous painting is like hearing the chanting of monks in a temple.

(3) No. 5, "Mountain and Sea Delicacies," by Kobo Gyoun. The artist is the leader of the Southern Painting Revival in Japan. This piece is a realistic work, depicting fish and taro. The colors are bright. The words, "Fresh fish from the sea before the railing, fresh vegetables from the fields behind the house," are very elegant.

(4) No. 39, "Marching Horse," by Kishi Tadao, is completely in the Japanese style, depicting the scene of Japanese warriors setting out to conquer the barbarians 1,500 years ago. The horses are plump, the men are strong, and the wind is fierce. The spirit of the samurai is fully expressed. The colors are exquisite, and the details are remarkable.

(5) No. 30, "Waterfowl," by Gokura Senjin. The artist is one of the modern painters. The feathers of the waterfowl are depicted in ink wash. One bird is diving into the water to forage, while another is leaping on the surface. The posture is elegant and the ancient style is abundant.

(6) No. 2, "Dawn," by Kiyokata Kaburagi. The artist is an elder of the Japan Art Institute and has received the Order of Culture. "Dawn" depicts the first rays of the sun shining on Mount Fuji. The white snow reflects the sky, and clear smoke fills the mountains below. The view from the top is extremely majestic, entrusting the spirit of Japan and East Asia to the sacred peak of Mount Fuji, symbolizing the light of East Asia. The composition and brushstrokes are both excellent. The powerful brushstrokes are awe-inspiring. It is said that the painting is done with Chinese pine soot ink, so it has a particularly charming quality. It is said that the artist has a large collection of Chinese ink sticks, which allows his works to have unique characteristics.

There are several exceptional pieces included in the special exhibits, including:

(1) "Monkeys," by Hashimoto Kansetsu. Hashimoto's name is not unfamiliar to China (this newspaper has translated and published his work "Shanghai Miscellany" in the "Free Talk" section). He has traveled extensively in China and has frequent exchanges with famous Chinese artists. "Monkeys" is his representative work. He uses vigorous ink brushstrokes to depict two black monkeys jumping on an ancient pine tree, set against a snowy landscape, devoid of any mundane atmosphere. It is said that Hashimoto's name became famous with the creation of "Monkeys," and he became a first-class Japanese master through his hard work, not by chance.

(2) "Domestic Rabbit and Monkeys," by Takeuchi Seiho, depicts three monkeys on a shelf, each with a different posture: one playing, one looking suspiciously, and the other looking wistfully. The emotions are vividly expressed on the canvas. The nine rabbits in the pen are very cute and are truly exceptional works.

(3) "Wheat Harvest," by Nishioka Itto, depicts a bundle of new wheat being brought to the threshing ground. Two calves sniff the wheat on the side, and several stalks of grain are placed under the calves' feet. Several branches of flowers are interspersed, creating an extremely clever composition. The artist is one of the elders of the Japanese art world.

Overall, all the exhibits can be called outstanding works. The above-mentioned pieces are those that I personally particularly admire and have recorded at random to express my appreciation.

Famous local painters Qian Shoutie, Zheng Wuchang, and Sun Xueni all visited the exhibition yesterday. Qian praised Hashimoto Kansetsu's work in particular.

Short Commentary

### Frugality Movement

It is said, "If the country is extravagant, show it frugality." This shows that frugality is a reaction against extravagance during peacetime. Currently, the country faces numerous difficulties, the world is impoverished, prices are soaring, and the people are struggling to survive. Therefore, "saving and consumption" has become one of the five major guidelines of the government's wartime economic policy, indicating that frugality is an adaptation to wartime poverty. While war is painful for the masses, it can be a rare opportunity for a few who are in safe areas and making speculative profits from the nation's difficulties. Therefore, frugality is also a reaction against the extravagant lifestyle of those who are profiting from the nation's difficulties during wartime.

Looking back at history, we know that frugality has always been the orthodox ideology, while advocating extravagance has been a heretical concept. Zeng Guofan once said, "It is easy to go from frugality to extravagance, but difficult to go from extravagance to frugality." Sun Chuanfang, as the commander-in-chief of the five-province allied forces, issued a "Frugality Pact," and the Executive Yuan of the National Government promulgated the "Provisional Regulations for Government Personnel to Eliminate Wasteful Customs" in the 25th year of the Republic of China. Recently, this newspaper, in the spirit of "everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation," has proposed a "Convention for Saving on Banquets" in an attempt to restrain the extravagant trends in Shanghai, even if only slightly. This is just one aspect of the long history of frugality.

Hu Linyi, one of the famous ministers of the Restoration during the Xianfeng and Tongzhi reigns of the late Qing Dynasty, once said, "It is essential to strictly prohibit the vulgar customs of officialdom's social interactions, and to encourage all officials to be honest and simple, and to eliminate vanity." Therefore, his political achievements were second only to Zeng Guofan. If he had lived longer, his achievements might have surpassed Zeng Guofan's.

Frugality in peacetime must start with the political circles to set an example. However, the current situation is different. Government employees are paid poorly, and the extravagant feasting in political circles has subsided. Therefore, frugality in wartime must start with the business community, as those who profit from the nation's difficulties are mostly hoarders in the business community, and those who spend money like water are also from this group. In the past, the social hierarchy in China was "scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants," but now it has changed to "merchants, artisans, farmers, and scholars." Therefore, the target of the frugality movement is the business community, and the responsibility for saving the declining social customs and the economic crisis also lies with the business community.

### Actively Rectifying Financial Institutions - The Bankers' Association Implements Self-Discipline

The Ministry of Finance has decided to strengthen financial institutions and has made a decision to reorganize small banks. Banks with a total capital of less than three million yuan will not be allowed to operate. The implementation measures will be announced soon. As a result, banks have recently been scrambling to increase their capital or discuss mergers, as this is the only way for them to continue to exist.

Joint Operations are Very Possible

According to a report from the Guofeng News Agency, based on inquiries with people in the Chinese banking industry, bank mergers are the most necessary measure. However, considering the individual characteristics of each bank, mergers may be difficult. Therefore, it seems more likely that banks will form lending syndicates at any time to engage in joint operations, rather than mergers. However, the Bankers' Association is currently working to establish normal relations between banks and agriculture, industry, and commerce, and is engaging in self-discipline. It also hopes that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry can promptly provide appropriate supervision, and that any banks with illegal business practices, regardless of their capital, should be decisively dealt with.

New Banks Established in May and June

Most of the newly established banks recently have capital of more than 300,000 yuan. For example, among the twelve new banks established in April and May, eight have capital of 300,000 yuan, while only four have capital of less than 300,000 yuan. The names and capital of each bank are listed below: Nanjing Xingye 300 (unit: 10,000 yuan), Tongye 300, Yonghe 250, Donghua 300, China Porcelain Industry 300, Shi Kang 300, Tonghua 300, Yitai 300, Jinde 200, Fuzhong 250, China Wine Industry 200, China Qinye 300.

General Situation of Bank Capital Increase

In addition, among the banks that have increased their capital in the past two months, only one has a new capital of less than 300,000 yuan. The details are as follows: Pudong Bank 100 (old capital, unit: 10,000 yuan) - 500 (new capital), Great Wall 60-300, Dalai 50-100, Shanghai Industry and Commerce 200-500, Shanghai Shiye 100-500, Asia 100-500, Yongming 200-500, Shenzhou Shiye 150-500, Taihe Xing 60-500, Jiangzhe Enterprise 150-500, China Industry 400-600, Dakang 100-500, Danan 200-500, Daxin 200-500, Ruihua 200-500.

### The Central Bank and Others Regulate Financial Markets at the End of June

In view of the approaching end of June settlement period, the Central Bank of China and the Silver and Money Industry Reserve Treasury, in order to regulate interbank finance and stabilize the market, are making every effort to handle interbank lending and discounting to facilitate turnover. (1) Short-term interbank lending by the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank of China is limited to real estate in the concession area, joint bank promissory notes, public treasury certificates, non-speculative and non-essential goods, and securities as collateral, with a maximum term of three days. (2) The Silver and Money Industry Reserve Treasury will provide lending to Mogadishu. Member banks and pawnshops can apply for lending with property as collateral. The amount of lending will be determined based on the evaluated value, and the term will be set at ten days. (3) The deposit reserve funds paid by each bank and pawnshop can be guaranteed by the association to apply for discounting from the Central Bank of China, temporarily based on the principle of discounting 70% of the current interest rate for each bank and pawnshop. After the capital positions of each bank and pawnshop have been regulated by the Central Bank of China, their own foundations have become more robust. All current accounts can be handled as usual. Under extremely cautious conditions, lending for legitimate needs in various industries can be accommodated. (1) Lending for the purchase of agricultural products, such as wheat, new tea, rapeseed, and beans, will be provided as much as possible, but only to the relevant industries. (2) Loans for industrial and commercial enterprises that need to increase production will be granted after review. (3) Loans due at the end of June, regardless of credit or collateral, may be extended if there are legitimate reasons and no violations of laws and regulations. Therefore, the entire financial system in Shanghai has remained stable after direct regulation, and industrial and commercial enterprises will be able to safely navigate this end-of-June settlement period.

### The Central Bank and the Bank of Communications Handle Wheat Loans

The new wheat harvest in the major producing areas will begin around the 20th of this month. This year, the weather and rainfall have been favorable, and the wheat season has been bountiful. The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the Commercial and Trade Commission has established branch offices in nine regions, including Shanghai, Nanjing, and Wuhu, to strengthen the work of purchasing wheat. All of these offices are required to complete their organization by today (the 15th). Regarding the funds for purchasing wheat, an agreement has been signed with the Central Bank of China to designate the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications to provide loans of 100 million yuan in June and July to meet the needs of purchasing wheat funds. It is reported that these wheat loans will be handled in the form of commercial acceptance drafts, and sellers can rediscount the commercial drafts they issue with the Central Bank of China.

### The Check Clearing System Will Not Be Abolished

Since the Central Reserve Bank of China took over the Clearing House on June 1 and handled exchange clearing, checks deposited by the same industry are treated the same as cash, so the future of check clearing will disappear. However, the Joint Bank Association believes that check clearing is still necessary when the money supply is tight, so it requested that the system continue to exist. It is reported that after consultations this year, it was decided that check clearing will still exist in principle, but it must be operated under the management of the Ministry of Finance.

### The Central Savings Society Issues Regulations for Special Savings Lottery Tickets

In order to encourage people to save, the Central Savings Society has issued regulations for the issuance of special savings lottery tickets in accordance with the provisions of the charter. The tickets are currently being printed and are expected to be issued in early July. The lottery will be drawn publicly in Shanghai at the end of September. The first batch of lottery tickets will be exclusively managed by Tianyun Company in this city, which will distribute them to various sales outlets.

### Grain Merchant Registration Fees Have Been Determined

The Shanghai District Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association has been handling the registration of grain merchants on behalf of the Ministry of Food for the past few days. The regulations stipulate that merchants with capital of 200,000 yuan or more are classified as Grade A. The registration fee for miscellaneous grain vendors is 1,000 yuan. Those with capital of 100,000 yuan or more are classified as Grade B, with a registration fee of 600 yuan.
