### The Middle-of-the-Road Stance of the Chinese Intellectual Class

— Yoshida Tosuke

(I) The People's Reaction to Politics

"Bu Yao ruled the world for fifty years. Did he know whether the world was well-governed or not? Did he know whether the people willingly supported him or not? He asked those around him, but they did not know. He asked those at court, but they did not know. He asked those in the wilderness, but they did not know." This is a section from the "Eighteen Histories Abridged," which says that even for an enlightened emperor like Yao, it was difficult to know the people's reaction to politics. It also illustrates how rare it was to find someone with the courage to directly convey the people's reaction to politics to those around Emperor Yao.

The National Government has been "ruling the world for three years." On the anniversary of the return to the capital, Mr. Chen Fumu, in the magazine "China and East Asia," frankly pointed out the Chinese people's reaction to current politics. This is an expression of the National Government's "sincerity" towards the people's politics and is a noteworthy article.

Mr. Chen expressed deep regret that he only used complimentary words to describe this issue in various Chinese and Japanese newspapers that "represent public opinion." He "paid close attention to the reactions of ordinary Chinese people and silently observed the results of these reactions." He summarized the reactions he heard from the people into the following five conclusions:

(1) "Whether the National Government has achievements or not, let's wait until after the war is over before we talk about it. It's too early to talk about it now."

(2) "Prime Minister Tojo's visit to China is certainly an unprecedented event, but Japanese prime ministers have also visited Taiwan and Lushun."

(3) "The abolition of extraterritoriality is gratifying, but can Chinese courts really try Japanese people?"

(4) "The return of control over materials is good, but Advisor Bonabe has stated that local areas will still hire Japanese economic experts to assist in the future. Perhaps things will be more efficient with their help."

(5) "The National Government's institutions have undergone major reforms twice and adjustments several times. Wasn't the Chongqing regime also reformed and adjusted several times? Weren't the results the same?"

(See Mr. Chen's leading article, "The National Government is Moving Towards Strengthening," in the April issue of "China and East Asia.")

Mr. Chen does not discuss whether these popular reactions are justified, but their reactions, it can be asserted, are definitely not nonsense and are factual. I would like to research whether these popular reactions are justified on behalf of Mr. Chen. But because I do not have time to analyze each of the five items one by one, I will only make a critique of the most important first item, that is, the Chinese people's suspicion of the "middle-of-the-road" position toward reality.

(II) The Reason for the Existence of the Middle-of-the-Road Stance

Even if the Nanjing National Government does not strengthen itself, the overall situation will ultimately be determined by the outcome of the world war, and there is no need to do anything before then. This view is a fairly firm idea among the Chinese people, especially among the intellectual class. In practice, this is a covert hope for the victory of the anti-Axis side, so it seems that all cooperation with Japan is being neglected. This attitude can indeed be seen in some of the so-called "neutral elements" in Shanghai. Standing in the position of the Chinese intellectual class, this attitude cannot be condemned with the term "cunning." Everyone knows that the Chinese intellectual class, since the National Revolution until today, has taken the spirit of anti-imperialist national independence as its consistent ideological foundation. Since the Opium War, under the oppression of the great powers, China's first priority should be to eliminate the oppression of the great powers to achieve national independence. Therefore, the Chinese intellectual class has shouldered this task in their existence. However, in China, where material civilization is backward, it is impossible to expel imperialism independently, so the diplomatic policy of "using barbarians to control barbarians" was created. Whether it is the Axis side or the anti-Axis side, as long as it can liberate China from its semi-colonial status, either side is fine. On the surface, this is indeed "cunning," and it is also an inevitable "cunningness" that arises from China's national independence methods in the international environment it has always been in. Therefore, the Chinese intellectual class tends to the Axis side if it believes that the Axis side has the possibility of satisfying China's national independence demands; if it sees that the anti-Axis side has this possibility, it tends to the anti-Axis side. The advance and retreat of the world war situation is one of the major factors that influences this possibility, so it is an undeniable fact that the Chinese intellectual class's realistic actions are influenced by the future of the world war situation. The reason why a part of the Chinese intellectual class in the peaceful areas does not participate in the Nanjing National Government and exists as "neutral elements" can be explained in part by this middle-of-the-road stance.

The May 9th editorial of the Mainland News raised the issue of neutral elements and strongly advocated that "the National Government should open its doors widely... so that economists and intellectuals can each find their place." This is a brilliant view. The statement that the Chinese "intellectual class is harmed by its classical mentality and non-constructive character, and often cannot go beyond the attitude of criticism and ends up in the position of neutral elements" lacks understanding of this fundamental requirement of the Chinese intellectual class. The Chinese intellectual class is by no means harmed by "classical mentality" and "non-constructive character." No, many Chinese intellectuals, with "modern mentality" and "constructive character," are participating in various construction projects in the peaceful areas and in the "anti-Japanese war" areas at the same time. Therefore, in order to make the Chinese intellectual class cooperate with the Chinese government, it is necessary to break down this weakness of the middle-of-the-road stance and at the same time respond to their fundamental national demands. In this way, they will be happy to participate in the government.

(III) The Defects of the Chinese Intellectual Class's Middle-of-the-Road Stance

The defect of the Chinese intellectual class's middle-of-the-road stance lies in their overly subjective analysis of the world situation. For example, a certain neutral element once said that if the Tunisian front ends soon, the Anglo-American second front will be launched immediately, which may be correct, or it may not be known. However, the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States is one of mutual utilization and mutual contradiction. If the United States and Britain had launched the second front long ago, the Soviet Union could have had time to rest, while the United States and Britain would have borne the brunt of Germany's strong attacks alone; therefore, the United States and Britain are trying their best to get the Soviet Union to launch a summer offensive first, and lure Germany to launch a summer offensive in the Soviet Union, and then launch a second front. In this way, it can reduce the counterattack from Germany and prevent the Soviet Union from being significantly strengthened. To go a step further, even if the United States and Britain launch a second front in a very short period of time, its scale will definitely not be that large. They always seem to want Germany and the Soviet Union to fight each other.

Assuming that the launch of the second front is successful and the Axis side is defeated, what will be the impact on East Asia? Many middle-of-the-road Chinese intellectuals say that at that time, the United States and Britain will use their combined military force to attack Japan, and Japan will be in danger. However, if Germany and Italy are defeated in Europe, the Soviet Union's power in Europe will greatly expand, and the entire European continent, which is困ed by war, will obviously be in danger of a communist revolution. The impact of this will threaten not only the position of the Conservative Party in the United States and Britain, but also the Labor Party. On March 21 of this year, Churchill said: "After destroying Germany, we will use all our resources and all our military power to wage war against Japan." However, after destroying Germany, Britain will be busy dealing with the spread of communist forces in Europe. At that time, Britain will become the police of all of Europe. Whether it will have the extra energy to take care of the Far East is worth considering deeply.

Going a step further, assuming that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union solve Europe and then come to solve Japan. Roosevelt and Churchill have been discussing "post-war plans" with great enthusiasm. The post-war mentioned here is of course the "post-war" after the defeat of Japan, Germany, and Italy. In such a "post-war," the Soviet Union's pressure on its eastern and western borders will naturally disappear, so its power will undoubtedly become significantly stronger. Moreover, the unrest caused by labor issues in various countries after the war is something that can be learned from the previous war. Of course, the labor problems in the United States and Britain will also greatly deteriorate at that time. The people of Japan, Germany, and Italy will eventually compete with the United States and Britain for world hegemony as long as they have the opportunity. In addition, the colonies of the United States and Britain will also rise up and demand independence. If these anti-British and American elements combine, the ruling classes of the United States and Britain will certainly think that they cannot maintain their current position. Therefore, the so-called "post-war" of the United States and Britain can really be regarded as the defeat of the United States and Britain.

This is a subjective observation made by the author from the position of a Japanese, and it is also what some Chinese intellectuals imagine. The post-war era is the era of "Pacific Charter" rule. In previous wars, the victor proposed peace terms to the loser, and if the loser accepted those terms, peace was restored. From this simple concept, they imagine what the "Pacific Charter" will be like. However, the defeated people will never forget hatred and shame. As long as this national hatred and shame exist, the war will also exist. The Treaty of Versailles did not suppress the German people. In fact, this war is just an extension of the previous war. Therefore, this world war will not have such a half-hearted ending. So, when will the people who say "Let's wait until the war is over before we talk about it. It's too early to talk about strengthening the National Government now" plan to wait until?

(IV) Let Us Decide the World War

After the Napoleonic Wars, when the Bourbon dynasty was restored, there were so-called French émigré nobles who asked the Bourbon dynasty for rewards for not surrendering to the revolution during the war, but at that time the social situation in France had completely changed, so most of their requests could not be accommodated. If some of China's neutral elements also follow the example of the French émigré nobles and hope for rewards for not cooperating with Japan, then it would probably be too embarrassing. Of course, in the middle-of-the-road stance of the Chinese intellectual class, there are few people who mix in such selfish motives, and most of them are motivated by the country and combine the fate of the nation with the future of the world war. Now I want to point out the great fallacy of this nationalistic middle-of-the-road thinking.

It is a pity that we East and West peoples have been unconsciously influenced by European and American culture. Many people think that the saying "The focus of the current world war is still the European war situation" is correct. Therefore, many Chinese intellectuals concluded that "The world war is determined by the European battlefield." This statement seems to have some logical deviations. The world war is determined by the comprehensive result of the fighting forces of the whole world, and is definitely not determined by the result of the local European war situation. Moreover, Japan's strategic position in Asia, in a situation like the present, the rhetorical expression that "the world war is determined by the European battlefield" is not correct. When Chinese intellectuals say this, they clearly do not add China's current power in Asia to the factors that determine the world war. Although China has gone down the wrong path, the Chinese nation has after all maintained the tradition of fighting the world's best Japanese army for six years. Everyone knows how the British and American troops in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Manila were no match for the Japanese army and collapsed at the first sign of trouble. Japanese soldiers admit that the Chinese army is much more tenacious and courageous than the British and American armies. On this point, the Chinese intellectual class cannot but maintain a little self-confidence in the power of the Chinese nation. If China and Japan cooperate and point their guns at the United States and Britain, it is not difficult to say that "the world war is determined by Asia." The world war is not "determined" by others, but "determined" by us.

The Chinese intellectual class is not aware of the power of Asia (on this point, the Japanese pro-Western faction is also the same), and the fact that it has unconsciously been infected with European and American centralism is not without reason from a historical point of view. China, like Japan, is busy absorbing European and American material civilization, but unlike Japan, this country has not completed the national revolution, and national capital has succumbed to British and American comprador capital. As a result, the Chinese in blood, and the overseas Chinese whose thoughts are close to Europeans and Americans and their many descendants are ranked as the ruling class. Among Chinese politicians, there are countless people who cannot write Chinese and write official documents in English, such as Soong Tzu-wen, Soong Mei-ling, and Kung Hsiang-hsi. It cannot be said that such Eurasian hybrids in thought are the honor of the Chinese nation.

National capital and the national ruling class are, of course, constantly fighting against this comprador capital and comprador ruling class. This constitutes a major part of the factional struggle within the Chongqing regime. The factional struggle within the Chongqing regime is fundamentally a struggle between "Asian China" and "British-American China." Within China, no, in all parts of Asia, "Asian" and "British-American" are fighting in different forms. Of course, Japan is no exception. These many local struggles, in the process of the world war, have a tendency to develop into a great struggle of "Asia" against "Britain and America." Therefore, the reason why the Chinese intellectual class is waiting for the end of the world war with their hands tied is because they do not see this struggle.

(V) Conclusion

The conscious Chinese intellectual class is gradually liquidating its middle-of-the-road stance and starting to fight the "British-American" in "Asia." They are reviewing whether the current Nanjing National Government can be regarded as the center of this struggle in China. Mr. Chen Fumu boldly raised a question that Chinese people have: "Prime Minister Tojo's visit to China is certainly an unprecedented event, but Japanese prime ministers have also visited Taiwan and Lushun." This question, spoken in the Chinese etiquette style, seems to have its one-sided reasons, but its content is probably somewhat disrespectful to the Nanjing National Government. However, the Chinese intellectual class's disrespectful question to the Nanjing National Government may not be out of malice. As mentioned above, among the Chinese intellectual class, there is an awareness that in this world situation, they must use their own strength to do something. They earnestly ask whether the Nanjing National Government can become the subject of the Asian liberation struggle in China. Whether those who make a concrete response to this question can fully understand the neutral elements of the Nanjing National Government, and whether they can absorb them into the Nanjing National Government, depends on the position of the Nanjing National Government itself. The major question of whether the leaders of "Asian China" in Chongqing can merge with the Nanjing government goes without saying that it will also be determined by this. (Translated by Xiang)

### Japanese Troops in Dongting Lake Advance Northward, Occupying the County Seat of Gong'an in Hubei Province; Hundreds of Chongqing Troops Killed in Action

Hankou, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a continuous stream of telegrams from Hunan, Gong'an (50 kilometers northwest of Shishou), a major stronghold of the Chongqing (10th Group Army), fell on the 15th due to fierce attacks from the Japanese army on three sides: north, east, and south. Hundreds of defeated Chongqing troops were annihilated.

Hankou, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to telegrams from the Hunan front line on the 15th, since the Japanese army launched an annihilation battle against the Chongqing (10th Group Army) from both the north and south routes at half past midnight on the 12th, they have completely surrounded five divisions of the Chongqing army. In this battle, the southern route Japanese army departed from a certain location on the north bank of the Wei River at half past midnight on the 12th, and after occupying Zhijiang County, a stronghold of the Chongqing (55th Division), at dawn on the 13th, they continued to advance from the direction of Chayuansi (23 kilometers west of Zhijiang), occupying Xiqi (40 kilometers west of Gong'an) by the morning of the 14th. Another unit of the southward-moving Japanese army, after defeating the Chongqing army, reached a location 20 kilometers north of Dabian Lake at noon on the 14th. At the same time, the northern route Japanese army, after departing from the banks of Dongting Lake, divided into two routes at the Daping Canal, one route attacking Xinhe City, and the other advancing elsewhere. The Chongqing side (12th Division), (43rd Division), (118th Division), (54th Division), (New 23rd Division), and other 50,000 troops are stubbornly resisting by relying on the several lines of defense built in the Yongnian area and the steep terrain in the northwest of the south bank of the Yangtze River. The elite Japanese troops are pressing the enemy from an advantageous position and have completed a solid encirclement near Gong'an, stretching for tens of kilometers, and are gradually tightening the encirclement.

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency)

The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 12:00 today the war results of the Central China Japanese Army units launching an offensive operation against approximately 70,000 Chongqing troops along the Dongting Lake coast from the 5th to the 11th of this month: 13,100 Chongqing troops abandoned their corpses, approximately 1,300 were captured, and the spoils of war included 13 artillery pieces, 145 heavy and light machine guns, and 1,458 rifles. The Japanese side suffered 1,640 casualties and deaths.

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - A telegram from the Hunan front line stated that after the Japanese army formed an encirclement in the Xiqi-Gong'an area, they launched an annihilation battle against the besieged Chongqing troops. At 7:00 AM on the 15th, they joined forces with the southward-moving Japanese army north of Xiqi, completing a joint front line. The retreat route for the Chongqing troops between Gong'an, Xinhe City, and Xiqi has been completely cut off, so the time for their annihilation is imminent. The Japanese army advancing south from the Dabian Lake area occupied Gong'an and advanced west of Gong'an on the morning of the 15th. Also, one route of the Japanese army advancing south from Zhijiang County, after defeating the Chongqing army resisting from the dangerous terrain, occupied Xiqi on the 14th and continued to advance south. They have now joined up with the rapid deployment units of the Japanese army that turned north from the Anxiang area, cutting off the retreat route for the Chongqing troops fleeing from Gong'an. According to reports, the Chongqing troops currently surrounded by the Japanese army include the main force of the 50th Division with 4,000 men near Fangjia Village, 3 kilometers northwest of Mengxi Temple; approximately 1,000 men from the 121st and 185th Divisions near Liujia Factory, 30 kilometers southwest of Zhijiang; 1,000 men from the 59th Division near Pingjia Bay, 13 kilometers southeast of Liujia Factory; and 2,000 men from the 121st Division near Guanyin Temple, north of Xiqi, totaling 8,000 troops.

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency)

Also, during the Japanese army's operations in Hubei in February of this year, Jin Yi-wu (Commander of the Vanguard Corps) and Su Zhendong (former Brigade Commander of Wang Jinzai's army), who had surrendered, also actively participated on the front lines alongside the National Army. Starting from the 10th, they began attacking the New Fourth Army, which was stirring in the Bailu Lake-Jianli area, 30 kilometers northwest and east, and are sweeping away the Communist forces with unstoppable momentum, currently advancing near Laoxinkou and Xiaoshakou City.

Shanxi War Situation Nanjing, 14th

Japanese Central News Agency - According to the Japanese army's Shanxi front line, after the elite Japanese troops thoroughly annihilated the Chongqing army group under Liu Bocheng, which was entrenched around Shexian, the remnant Chongqing-puppet troops successively fled into the mountainous areas of Shanxi and Hebei provinces. The Japanese army has reduced the encirclement of this area and is pursuing the remaining Chongqing troops everywhere, as well as destroying the bandit-communist facilities in the area. On the 12th, the Japanese army advanced towards Liangpenkou and is actively expanding the war results. Another unit of the Japanese army launched a mopping-up operation in Ancun, north of Shexian. In total, the war results for the 11th and 12th days were: 49 Chongqing troops killed in action, 92 captured, and two military supply factories destroyed.

In order to facilitate command, six air defense command zones have been established in the east, south, west, north, center, and water areas, with one commander and one deputy commander in each zone responsible for the air defense work in their respective zones. The headquarters has now been established, and the city's air defense will be further strengthened in the future.

### Churchill Warns Nationals That England is Still in Danger of Being Attacked; Roosevelt and Churchill Conferred for the Second Time With Their Entire Staff; Independent Labor Party Member Bitterly Repudiates Foreign Policy

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency)

British Prime Minister Churchill, broadcasting by wireless to England from Washington tonight, warned: "England is facing a terrible enemy, and the British Isles are still in danger of being invaded by Germany." He also stated that if Germany were to invade, the first to bear the brunt of the battle would be the domestic Home Guard. The Prime Minister's speech was delivered on the third anniversary of the founding of the Home Guard. The Prime Minister declared, "The entire fighting strength of England depends on the safe defense and full sustenance of our small island region. This region is only twenty-one miles from German cannons and only a few minutes' flight from German airfields." The Prime Minister also pointed out that England is still constantly being besieged and attacked by sea and air. He said, "The degree of danger of invasion depends entirely on the strength of the military and the preparations for dealing with the invasion. The larger our military, the more difficult it will be for the enemy to cross the sea and invade, and the better our goals will be."

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency)

According to Washington news, Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt conferred this afternoon with their entire staff. This was the second time since Churchill arrived in Washington on Tuesday that he and President Roosevelt had conferred with the entire naval and army staff and important advisors from both England and the United States.

Stockholm, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to London news, during a meeting of the Independent Labor Party yesterday, Independent Labor Party member McGovern spoke out bitterly against British Prime Minister Churchill's foreign policy, saying that Churchill had gathered cowardly rebel generals, foreign politicians, socialists, and union leaders together in London. "We must overthrow Churchill's rule, because if we do not, Churchill may lead us to destruction." Churchill's acceptance of various rebel generals is a determination to continue the war with the blood of English workers. McGovern also commented on the idea of a union between the Labor Party and the Communist Party, saying that under certain circumstances, the Labor Party may have a future, but once it merges with the Communist Party, its end will begin.

### Italian Newspaper Discusses the Tunisia Campaign; Has Done Its Best to Restrain

Rome, 15th (Central News Agency) - Stefani News Agency, former Italian Minister of Culture, Pavolini, published an article in the News Report yesterday, recalling the heroic achievements of the Italian First Army, stating, "When the officers and soldiers received the order to cease resistance, they all had the determination to die. This brief order ended three years of war in Africa." Italy had done its best in this campaign, escorting weapons and troops by sea, supplying the needs of Abyssinia and Libya. Although the troops fighting overseas did not receive all the supplies they needed, everything that Rome had, or could be purchased from distant places such as Japan, was delivered to the Italian military bases in Africa in a timely manner. Even though the African campaign has now come to an end, its importance to the future trend of the war still exists. For three years, the African campaign has consumed the strength of the so-called civilized countries of Europe and has enabled the fortress of Europe to be realized. Moreover, Japan has had sufficient time to consolidate its occupied position, and Italy has been able to complete the defense of its territory. Therefore, it can be concluded that every soldier who died in Africa had his value. What closed in Africa the other day was a glorious chapter, but it was only a chapter, because the war history of Africa must continue.

### On the Eastern Front, the Kuban Bridgehead Has Only Small-Scale Contact; Soviet Troops Attacking German Positions are Repulsed

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - Colonel Hammer, a military correspondent stationed on the Eastern Front for the German News Agency, stated today that although the climate on the Eastern Front has improved, there was only small-scale combat activity in the entire Kuban bridgehead area on Thursday. Soviet troops made small-scale attacks in various places with weak units, but were repulsed before they entered the forward positions of the German troops. However, it is expected that the Soviet army will launch large-scale attacks again in the near future. This can be clearly seen from the large-scale transportation activities and the increase in heavy weapons in the deployment area. However, the German troops have also made the necessary preparations for this move. At present, except for the area northwest of Lisichansk, which has been fiercely contested by both sides for several days, there is no other important activity in the entire Eastern Front. The Soviet army used heavy weapons and tanks to assist in an attempt to seize several of the Donets Heights defended by German grenadiers. Fierce fighting ensued, often developing into hand-to-hand combat. German troops were able to defend their positions and repelled the Soviet troops on all fronts. As dusk approached, the enemy was forced to retreat to its original position. Major Fleida, an air force correspondent for the German News Agency, stated that on Thursday, the German Air Force concentrated its guidance on the lower reaches of the Kuban and the Donets operational area, attacking bombers and dive bombers, and launching fierce attacks on Soviet transportation artillery positions, airfields, and railways. As a result, the enemy's rear equipment suffered great damage. German fighters often covered the German army in groups and were completely successful. The Soviet Air Force is still suffering from the losses it suffered last week, so on Thursday, it only operated in the Kuban area with small teams of fighters and fighter-bombers. In the air battles in that area, German fighters shot down 18 of the enemy's 30 aircraft, and 5 Soviet aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft guns.

### In the Air Battle Over Russell Island, Japanese Aircraft Won Against Great Odds

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to experts here, the United States is attempting to carry out a total counter-offensive against Japan, in addition to activities in the Attu Island area of the Aleutian Islands, and is also strengthening air bases in the southwestern Pacific, working hard to replenish troops, and increasing military supplies. However, the Japanese naval air force often launches preemptive strikes, day and night, launching operations to destroy American aircraft. For example, on the 11th of May, a combined formation of fighters and bombers bombed Meroce on New Guinea during the day. On the 14th, there was a heavy bombing of Java. When Japanese aircraft bombed Meroce on that day, they destroyed two enemy military facilities. More than ten other facilities, such as barracks, fuel depots, and ammunition depots, were also bombed and set on fire. After completing their mission, all the Japanese aircraft safely returned to their original defenses. Also, when a fighter squadron raided the American air base on Russell Island on the 13th, they engaged in a fierce air battle with 40 American aircraft. As a result, they shot down 34 giant fighters, 1 Type 38 aircraft, and 3 Type 39 aircraft, for a total of 38 aircraft. This fully demonstrated the cooperation and superior technology of the Japanese army. Two Japanese aircraft have not yet returned. This time, Japanese aircraft attacked 40 enemy aircraft with only a few aircraft. The damage ratio was 38 to 2, and they achieved more than ten times the results, which proves the superiority of Japanese air force combat technology. However, after this blow, the enemy is expected to stir again in the future.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Washington, the US Navy Department announced today that the US Air Force had a large air battle with the Japanese Air Force over Russell Island, northwest of Guadalcanal.

According to another communiqué from General MacArthur's headquarters, Japanese aircraft also bombed Milne Bay in New Guinea, where casualties and damage were heavy.

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM today: 1. The Imperial Japanese Naval Air Force raided Meroce in New Guinea on May 11, and raided Guadalcanal Island on May 14, inflicting great damage on the enemy's facilities in the area. 2. The Imperial Japanese Naval Air Force shot down 38 enemy fighters in the air battle over Russell Island on May 13. Two of our aircraft did not return.

### Japanese Emperor's Eldest Daughter Holds Wedding Ceremony

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The wedding ceremony of His Royal Highness Prince Higashikuni Morihiro and Her Imperial Highness Princess Shigeko Teru was formally approved today, and the Japanese Ministry of the Imperial Household has officially announced it. According to the announcement, Her Imperial Highness Princess Shigeko Teru is the eldest daughter of His Majesty Emperor Showa and was born on December 6, 1925. She is now 19 years old and graduated from the women's learning institute with excellent grades this spring. His Royal Highness Prince Higashikuni Morihiro was born on May 6, 1916, and is the first prince of His Royal Highness Prince Higashikuni General. After graduating from the undergraduate course of the Army Officer's Academy in July 1937, he continued to study at the Army University in December 1942. During this period, His Royal Highness served as the captain of the third line during the Nomonhan Incident in the summer of 1939. In July 1942, he participated in the operations in the Philippines and established a brilliant military record in the Battle of Corregidor. His bravery was praised by the entire army.

### Japanese Guard Unit Counterattacks: American Forces Land on Attu Island

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to military experts commenting on the Aleutian Islands battle, last June, the Japanese military's operations in the Midway Islands and the entire eastern Pacific region made it difficult for the enemy to cope. On June 4th, a surprise attack was launched on the enemy's base at Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands and surrounding military facilities. On the 5th, repeated attacks were carried out. On the 7th, through close coordination between land and naval forces, Kiska Island was captured. On the 8th, Attu Island was also captured, giving the Japanese a major base within the enemy's northern front, which was heavily defended. The enemy then began preparing for a counterattack. By this year, the enemy's land forces in Alaska and the eastern Aleutian Islands had been increased to several divisions, and air power had also increased to some extent. As a result, a sizable enemy fleet in the area began to operate, gradually pushing its base westward, intending to threaten the Japanese military. By early February of this year, an airfield was established at Amchitka, near the Japanese-occupied Kiska Island, equipped with giant aircraft and guarded by ground troops. Since then, the American military has repeatedly attempted to cut off Japanese supply lines with its air and naval forces, isolating the Japanese garrison and attempting to weaken Japanese strength by bombing Japanese positions. However, the Japanese military has been able to overcome difficulties such as ice, snow, heavy fog, and food shortages, firmly defending their positions and fiercely attacking incoming enemy aircraft with ground fire, preventing them from achieving their objectives. From January to April of this year, a total of over a dozen enemy aircraft have been shot down. Since the arrival of spring, the battle situation on the Aleutian front has become even more intense, and enemy air raids have gradually increased. On the 12th of this month, a strong enemy force, under the cover of heavy fog and its naval and air forces, landed on Attu Island. The Japanese guard unit immediately counterattacked, and fierce fighting is currently underway in the dense fog. There is no sign of the enemy on Kiska Island.

Buenos Aires, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to dispatches from Washington, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox stated that the recent landing of American forces on Attu Island was a joint operation by the Army and Navy, and the Marine Corps did not participate.

### Rome Hosts Japanese-Italian Cultural Conference

### Japanese Naval Press Officer Broadcasts Frontline Situation: Soldiers' Morale High, All Confident of Victory; Land-Sea Integrated Operations Exhibit Ingenious Strategy

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – Lieutenant Colonel Tadashiro Kaku, a press officer from the Japanese Imperial Headquarters Navy, recently returned to the country after inspecting various frontline areas centered on the Solomon Islands in mid-April. At 7:30 PM on the 14th, he delivered a radio address from Tokyo titled "Returning from the Frontline," the main points of which are as follows: all Japanese-occupied territories, including the regions of Burma, the central Pacific, and the Aleutian Islands, are now decisive battlefields, and the time for decisive battle has arrived. During my recent inspection of the Solomon Islands frontline, I witnessed the extremely high morale of the soldiers, all of whom are confident of victory. The overall strategy of our operations is clear and obvious. Since the start of the war, we have quickly seized the enemy's bases and key points, consolidating our operational bases. Our forces then seized the opportunity to launch an offensive. In the South Pacific, we have suppressed the enemy from New Guinea to the Solomon Islands line. In "land-sea integrated" operations, we have displayed ingenious strategy and won every battle. During my visit to a certain base, a sudden air raid alert sounded in the middle of the night. I immediately jumped up and went to the designated location. I saw our commander and staff calmly observing the movements of the enemy aircraft. Their every action was calm and composed, which greatly increased my courage and convinced me that "we will definitely win this war." Furthermore, what moved me most on the front line was the close cooperation between the Japanese Army and Navy units, leaving no room for exploitation. For example, the Navy's food supply entirely depends on the Army's support, and there is no shortage. This is due to the Army's enthusiasm. Conversely, the Navy deeply appreciates the Army's efforts in fighting fiercely at the base, allowing the Navy to have no worries about the rear. Secondly, the spirit of our soldiers fighting hard: the region is a land of harsh, malarial conditions. Our forces are fighting on one hand with the enemy, and on the other hand with malaria. The United States once said that "this jungle area must be the worst battlefield for human combat," which is indeed true. It is said that the number of American soldiers who died from malaria is five times more than the number who died from gunfire. When the United States announced that the American Navy stationed on Guadalcanal Island was relieved by Army and Marine units during one day, almost none of these Navy units survived due to the Japanese military's fierce attacks and the prevalence of malaria. On the Japanese side, due to the activities of disease prevention teams, fewer people contracted the disease, which is a testament to the meritorious service of the disease prevention soldiers. In short, the integrated operations of the Japanese Army and Navy on the front line, and their loyal and resolute spirit, are deeply unforgettable for us.

### A Great Tragedy in World History (4)

— Tokutomi Iichiro

(4) Party Politics Leads to National Ruin

Among the many reasons for the decline of Great Britain, a major one is the political deadlock caused by British party politics. Britain is the birthplace of party politics, and those who praise party politics around the world regard Britain as their shrine. Just as Jerusalem is for Christians, Bodh Gaya is for Buddhists, Mecca is for Muslims, and Qufu is for Confucians, in the eyes of party politicians, the British Parliament in Westminster is the sacred main hall of party politics. Wouldn't it be surprising and shocking to them if this party politics were seen as the root cause leading Britain down the path to destruction? Originally, British political parties were not deliberately created, and they were more of a coincidence than a natural development. During the Stuart dynasty, Parliament was not even permanent, and sometimes both the government and the people seemed to forget its existence. The kings of that time struggled greatly to convene Parliament and manage finances, but the people seemed quite content. In the next generation of the Stuart dynasty, Parliament was convened more often, but the more it was convened, the more intense the opposition became, leading to the division between the Royalist and the Parliamentarian parties. James I was a philosopher and theologian; as a scholar, he had the knowledge of a rural university professor, and he even had writings. However, he did not understand the principles of governing the country and bringing peace to the world. At the time, he was rightly described as "the wisest fool in Christendom."

Later, under Charles I, war broke out. The Parliamentarian party was nicknamed the "Roundheads" because they wore short hair; the Royalist party was called the "Cavaliers" because they consisted mostly of mounted soldiers. Under Charles II, the Royalists regained power, but under James II, he tried to restore Roman Catholicism, which had been rejected during the reign of Henry VIII, and forced the people to adhere to his religious beliefs, causing chaos and ultimately leading to his expulsion. The new monarchs welcomed by the opposition party were William of Orange from the Netherlands and his wife, Mary.

After that, the Whig party (the predecessor of the Liberal Party) became dominant, and the Tory party (the predecessor of the Conservative Party) almost disappeared. Under Queen Anne, the two parties were again in opposition. After Queen Anne, the king brought from Hanover, George I, was already in his fifties when he ascended the throne. He did not understand English at all. Although traditionally, the king had to personally preside over cabinet meetings, because the new king did not understand English, he was like a puppet even if he attended cabinet meetings, so he abandoned the practice of personally attending cabinet meetings. The British system of responsible government thus originated from the foreign-born king's lack of English. If it is said to be accidental, there is probably no such accident.

As mentioned above, the British cabinet, excluded from the King's affairs, was therefore held responsible to the Parliament. The responsibility of the ministers to the Parliament, and at the same time the joint responsibility of the ministers to each other, was thus established. Although there is a saying that "the king reigns but does not rule," it only became a common expression later.

In this way, the Whig party seized power with great force. It was not until George III, who was born in England and understood English, that there was a king who grew up in England. He wanted to restore royal power and rule personally, but he ultimately failed, and his ambition died with him. After that came the Victorian era. The Whig party became the Liberal Party, the Tory party became the Conservative Party. After the Irish Home Rule issue, the Unionists, who separated from the Liberal Party, merged with the Conservative Party, and the entire Conservative Party became known as the Unionist Party.

After the Irish question was resolved, the Conservative Party returned to its original form. Until after the First World War, the rise of the Labor Party led to the creation of a Labor Party cabinet. As a result, the Liberal Party became insignificant in British politics. The opposition between the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party became a thing of the past. To this day, what exists is only party politics in name. Therefore, today's British party politics is merely a formality. The idea of forming parties based on political views and implementing their claims and ideologies in actual politics is completely a relic of the past.

The British government, in theory, operates from top to bottom, with the distribution of power from the king to the nobility, from the nobility to the middle class, and from the middle class to the general public. However, in reality, it still remains in the hands of about a hundred noble or wealthy families. Their will, masked by the facade of party politics, is implemented smoothly and subtly. In short, British democracy is less a democracy of the people and more of a facade of democracy, carrying out the reality of oligarchy. Britain has maintained the feudal system since the Norman Conquest to this day, and has supplemented it with new transfusions of blood on the feudal system.

Platt said in the mid-Victorian era, "The owner of the land is the owner of the power." Currently, the owners of this land, during the seven years from 1920 to 1927, more than half of the landowners in England have changed. These people are the transfusers of blood into the aristocratic system.

These transfusers are Jews, or successful capitalists who have extremely close ties with Jews. They can effectively control Parliament at will. The veteran British journalist Lowe listed facts and discussed British politics, saying:

The British government is occupied by a class called a part of so-called social society. Those who are not tolerated in social society, no matter how talented they are, cannot become cabinet ministers.

Now, with the rise of the Labour Party, this situation may no longer be the same, but the main force still exists in the hands of the nobility and the wealthy. For example, in one era, the Cecil family in England had a father, nephew, and two sons, all of whom held important positions in the cabinet. At that time, the world called the cabinet the Cecil family's hotel company, because its relatives occupied as many as five positions in the cabinet.

Also, when the Chamberlain family was powerful, the British magazine "Punch" published a satirical drawing titled "The Expansion of the Empire Increases the Chamberlain Family's Contracting Work." This is because the Chamberlain family was a major shareholder in various munitions manufacturing companies in the Birmingham area. The powerful part of the company was owned or controlled by the Chamberlain family and their affiliates.

In 1940, a book entitled "The Hundred Families Who Dominate the British Empire" was published. According to this book, there is no significant difference between the British aristocracy, the wealthy, and political parties. They collude with each other, monopolize power, and indulge their private desires. Although what is described in the book may not be entirely credible, it is probably not too far off.

The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau announced to the city's passengers about the tricycle fare for business trips. The tricycle fare for business trips was previously submitted to the Public Utilities Bureau by the tricycle passenger car rental industry association, requesting the bureau to approve an increase in fares by the members of various companies to increase revenue. The bureau has assessed the current trend and, in order to avoid excessive burdens on passengers, has reduced the approved increase in the fare table.

The new fare table has been approved and forwarded to the tricycle companies for compliance.

A double-driver sedan is 11 yuan, plus 3 yuan for tips. A single-driver sedan is 10 yuan, plus 2 yuan for tips. For every 5 minutes exceeding, 1 yuan is charged for a single-seat covered car, and 1.5 yuan for the rest. The fare for one hour is set at 17 yuan for a double-seat car, 10 yuan for a single-seat car, 20 yuan for a double-driver sedan, and 17 yuan for a single-driver sedan.

At around 2:15 PM, the perpetrator was apprehended, the blockade was lifted, and the exercise appeared quite realistic.

### Ms. Zhang Liying's Oil Painting Solo Exhibition to be Held at the Metropole Hotel from the 18th to the 22nd

### China Film United Corporation Holds Tea Party Yesterday to Entertain the Press, Clarifies Management Policy, This Newspaper Opens Film Publicity Column

China Film United Corporation held a grand inaugural meeting the day before yesterday (14th). Yesterday (15th) at 3:00 PM, a tea party was held at the Metropole Hotel on Jiangxi Road to entertain the press for the establishment of the company. A large number of people gathered together in a warm atmosphere.

Chairman's Speech: First, Mr. Feng Jie, Standing Director and General Manager of the company, gave a speech, saying: "China Film United Corporation was formed by the merger of the original China, China United, and Shanghai Film companies. It started on May 1st and was officially announced to the public the day before yesterday, the 14th. Our company has a solid foundation and is not a hastily created organization. Its life is entrusted to the hands of people from all walks of life who love our company, to the hands of the government, and to the hands of officials and people from China, Japan, and Manchuria. There is no doubt about its future development. Our colleagues will uphold the difficulty of creation and the expectations of enthusiastic people, be of one heart and one mind, be practical and realistic, and strive for the Chinese film industry, for the people of society, and for the entire Greater East Asia. In the future, we will strive to become a modern cultural enterprise, whose performance can adapt to the requirements of the great era, and especially to enhance the spirit of "doing", hoping to advance vigorously with the general cause. In the current situation, the entire China and the entire East Asia are struggling hard. "Doing" means survival, and not "doing" means destruction. There is really no turning back. I have been serving in Shanghai for more than a year under the government's order to promote propaganda administration. Thanks to the guidance of the central government, the assistance of friendly officials and people, and the love of people from all walks of life, the progress has been very smooth and I am very grateful. I hope to receive even more assistance in the future."

Organizational Report: Then, Deputy General Manager Zhang Shankun reported on the merger of the company, saying: "Our company was established by the merger of China Film Company, China United Film Production Company, and Shanghai Cinema Company in order to adapt to the wartime cultural propaganda system. The production, distribution, and cinema departments are integrated into one. As the Deputy Manager of the production department, I will briefly report on the future film production policy. In the early stage of China United's film production, there was a slight emphasis on profitability, and some neglect in awareness was inevitable. However, in the later stage, film production was not for profit but had more educational and cultural components, and the awareness was quite pure. For example, the recent production of 'Wan Shi Liu Fang' has been praised by the press. In the future, our company's film production policy will follow the right track and work hard, but the company's colleagues have limited intelligence, and I hope that the press will continue to give us serious guidance." Next, Deputy General Manager Ishikawa Shunju reported on the current organizational status, saying: "The company is divided into five departments internally. The production department has been reported by Deputy Manager Zhang as above. The General Affairs Department is no different from ordinary companies and manages general affairs and accounting matters. The Distribution Department not only distributes the company's films but also focuses on film exchange. On the one hand, it distributes the company's films throughout East Asia, and on the other hand, it distributes Japanese and Manchu films. The Theater Department manages the operation of cinemas. Currently, the company directly manages 20 cinemas in Shanghai and more than 15 in South China and other places. In the future, the operation of cinemas will be further expanded. The Mobile Screening Department was established to adapt to the lack of cinemas in China. Mobile screening is very important in villages without cinemas, but there are many difficulties, but we will continue to work hard to complete the mission. In addition, there is also the organization of the Design Committee, whose task is not limited to one aspect but is designed for the development of each department and serves as a consulting body for the General Manager. The Film Research Institute specializes in researching film technology and investigating the development trends of the film industry. At the same time, branch offices are set up in various places, such as Nanjing, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Tokyo, all of which were established to adapt to the new stage."

Proposal by this Newspaper: Finally, Mr. Chen, President of this newspaper, proposed that the "Free Talk" section of this newspaper be used once a week as a film publicity column, as a gift to celebrate the establishment of China Film United Corporation. General Manager Feng accepted and expressed his gratitude. At 5:00 PM, refreshments were served and the meeting dispersed.

Brief Biography of Feng: The establishment of China Film United Corporation this time, with Feng Jie, Director of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office, serving as Standing Director and General Manager, is deeply gratifying to all parties. Mr. Feng is an alternate executive member of the Central Committee and Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department, and was specially appointed by the National Government as a member of the New National Movement Promotion Committee. He came to Shanghai last February and served concurrently as the Director of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office of the National Government. It is said that Mr. Feng will devote himself to the film industry in the future. Due to the factual relationship, the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office will only be an institution representing the Propaganda Department in Shanghai to guide and supervise its subordinate institutions and contact them. All affairs will be executed by the affiliated institutions, and the title of Director will still be held concurrently by Mr. Feng. It is also said that the office will be moved to the Hamilton Building.

Comments from the Economic Community

### Admonishing Trade Associations

Recently, trade associations in various industries have been reorganized one after another, and they are about to be completed. Organizing the ranks and refreshing the methods are good phenomena at present, but there are still many facts of performance that cannot immediately make people optimistic and have to be spoken frankly.

(1) Mutual contention among tradesmen. Often in the same association, A believes that the organization was first, while B claims that it has been contacted earlier. When the preparers are announced, those who are not selected often create additional problems, and the moderators are close to exclusion, causing many disputes and making the authorities feel difficult.

(2) Before the organization, each often has a private right concept, unwilling to be open and honest, and extend the business's well-reputed businessmen to participate together, even regarding the association as a private institution, only for the benefit of a few people, regardless of the public's welfare.

(3) The people used are not very selective, allowing one or two villains to mix among them, inevitably taking advantage of their position, causing criticism from the industry and inevitably affecting the group's prestige.

It must be known that running a public association is for the public, not for the private; it is for the benefit of the majority, not for the benefit of the minority; it is an absolutely public undertaking, not an ambiguous and self-serving collusion. Everything must have a spirit of great justice and selflessness, and extend the industry's public opinion. Everything should be considered for the overall situation of the country and society, not for personal rights and interests, and should be widely visited and connected to help the industry resolve difficulties; all matters that hinder the country, society, and the public should be eliminated vigorously, without favoritism, without corruption, without allowing villains, and without employing the wrong people. Only then can the reputation of the trade association be maintained without loss, and only then can it be sufficient to assist the difficult task of the Chamber of Commerce.

### Chamber of Commerce and Industry Establishes Three New Committees, Recruiting Leading Figures from the Military, Government, and Private Sectors to Participate

Since Japan implemented a new economic policy towards China, the Japanese economic community in Shanghai has had a great impact. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry has reviewed this issue and has decided to recruit powerful figures from the military, government, and private sectors to form a Sino-Japanese Consulting Committee. The Economic Shanghai Construction Committee and the Japanese Business Countermeasures Committee were approved at the general meeting on the 14th. The three newly established committees will adopt close links with the existing five departments of finance, transportation, industry, trade, and commerce within the Chamber of Commerce and Industry to establish a comprehensive policy system. This is its greatest purpose.

For this reason, the shortcomings of individual research and review of countermeasures in the past can be swept away from now on. In the future, all issues can be comprehensively summarized and considered from a legal standpoint, and countermeasures can be established. It is planned to carefully study specific countermeasures at each committee meeting. In addition, in order to review various issues from a broad standpoint, small committees will be set up under each committee, and celebrities from the military, government, and private sectors will be invited to participate. Small committees will be set up in Nanjing and Tokyo as necessary. From now on, Japan and Shanghai will echo each other, assisting in promoting the policy towards China and the new economic policy from the side, and at the same time contributing to the development of the Japanese economic community in Shanghai.

Regarding the operation of the three committees, Chairman Aoki of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry will explain it at the first joint meeting on the 19th. At the same time, the chairman and secretary-general of each committee will be appointed from among the members. Mr. Takeuchi Fumihiko, Executive Director of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, will serve as the secretary-general, and the secretaries will be selected from the members and the secretariat. At that time, Minister Tajiri and General Affairs Section Chief Okazaki of the Embassy, Economic Minister Okuda, and the heads of the economic departments of the Embassy, and Economic Section Chief Tanaka of the Consulate will also be present. The purposes of the three committees are as follows:

Sino-Japanese Affairs Committee

Due to the conversion of diplomatic policies, various Sino-Japanese relations have changed. However, the meaning of the conversion of diplomatic policies is not yet thorough. If the interpretations of China and Japan are different, it is difficult to achieve the purpose of the policy. Therefore, it is intended to exchange various information and review countermeasures in order to cooperate in promoting the restoration of the original Sino-Japanese relations in the economic and political fields.

Economic Shanghai Construction Committee

Due to the promotion of the new economic policy, the revitalization of China's economy is the most important issue. Therefore, the economic revival of Shanghai, known as the economic base of Central China, must be paid attention to. The success or failure of the construction of economic Shanghai is a major issue that affects the economic revival of China. The purpose is to review the revival of production, price countermeasures, material movement, and financial currency issues from various aspects in order to study and establish countermeasures.

Japanese Business Countermeasures Committee

Due to the vigorous promotion of the new economic policy, it is expected that Japanese business associations and firms will also undergo considerable changes. At the same time, experts generally advocate the reorganization and merger of associations, as well as the issue of changing industries. Therefore, the purpose of this committee is to establish countermeasures as the center to ensure Japanese economic power.

### The Economic Bureau Will Restore the Special Price Deliberation Council

The Municipal Economic Bureau regards stabilizing prices and ensuring people's livelihoods as the current key strategy. In accordance with the provisions of the central government's laws and regulations, in order to thoroughly rectify the city's prices, it is planned to restore the Municipal Price Deliberation Council and has been reported to the Huashi Municipal Government for approval and is actively preparing for it. However, before the establishment of the Council, all industries must sell according to the prices before the 30th of last month, and absolutely must not exceed them. Violators will be punished. The industry associations have been instructed to inform their respective businesses to strictly abide by them.

### Hua Stock Trends

Yesterday, Hua stocks turned firm. New Pharmaceutical continued to be hoarded by investors who made large purchases. China-France Pharmacy was the firmest, rising by more than three yuan. New Asia followed, rising by 125, with sales. The volume of transactions was also huge. The department store industry was also the target of investors. Wing On Company rose by six yuan, and National Goods rose by another two and a half yuan. Sincere alone fell by five yuan. Wing On Textile Mill in the textile industry rose by five yuan, and Mei Ya Silk Mill rose by three yuan amid buying momentum. The public utility industry was relatively stagnant.

### Registration Period for Yarn and Cloth Expires

The supplementary registration of cotton yarn and cotton cloth organized by the National Commercial Control Association ended yesterday (15th). No less than two hundred and several tens of cotton yarn and cotton cloth merchants went to register. It is learned that the supplementary registration of the Association has ended and will send staff to investigate. If unregistered cotton yarn and cotton cloth are found, in addition to not being able to enjoy the rights of purchase and movement, they will also be punished according to law.

### Director Inagaki Talks About Cooperating to Thoroughly Investigate Hoarding

The joint Sino-Japanese Materials Investigation Committee consists of Deputy Director Gotoh and Director Inagaki of the Materials Control Bureau of the Municipal Council. Director Inagaki recently gave a statement as follows: "I have not formally heard any intentions regarding this matter, and I only learned about the appointment in the newspaper. Therefore, the specific situation is not very clear. The Municipal Council will definitely fully cooperate with the National Government's policies. This point need not be repeated. The Municipal Council is also prepared to exert its capabilities and thoroughly investigate hoarding based on the decision of the Supreme National Defense Conference of the National Government. Of course, the hoarding in Shanghai now is done by people in the financial community, but the hoarding nature also exists in the practice of producers and wholesalers stockpiling goods for speculation. It is hoped that the distribution mechanism can be rectified, and at the same time, the National Government will launch decisive measures to deal with hoarded materials. A thorough investigation cannot be an end in itself, and it must be based on the investigation and focus on dealing with hoarding." (Cloud Peng: Translated from the May 15th Mainland News)

### Reactions from All Sectors to the Establishment of the Materials Investigation Committee

In order to deal with the problem of hoarding, the Supreme National Defense Conference approved the establishment of the Materials Investigation Committee on the 13th, which will be jointly organized by China and Japan. All sectors have expressed great concern about this. The reactions within the concession are generally as follows:

(1) After the first thorough investigation was completed, the people unanimously hoped that a second team of thorough investigation officials would be sent. It is now gratifying that a permanent Sino-Japanese cooperation mechanism can be established to promote the elimination of hoarding. At the current stage of abolishing extraterritoriality and implementing the new economic policy, the establishment of this Sino-Japanese joint committee is the result of the Japanese side's enthusiasm to assist the National Government. All sectors in the concession attach importance to the fact of Japanese cooperation and have high expectations for its future.

(2) After the first thorough investigation, the wholesale prices on the black market fluctuated up and down. On average, there was no increase in April, but the hoarded goods that were released did not flow into the market. However, A's hoarders released them, and B's hoarders bought them in. It has nothing to do with retail prices. Therefore, the hoarding problem and the price problem still need to be resolved in the future. It is hoped that this newly established committee will resolve them appropriately.

(3) When implementing the investigation of hoarded materials, it is hoped that the authorities will fully review the facts of hoarding and take realistic measures. For example, the hoarding methods of large hoarders are extremely clever. They break up their materials into smaller units and entrust them to their related businesses and relatives to conceal them. Hoarders who are not members of the same industry association entrust members of the same industry association to register in a false name, which does not match the original name of the owner. Moreover, all registered materials are ostensibly sold according to the limited price, but this is not the case in reality. Most of them enter and exit the black market, and beyond the black market, there is also a so-called black black market. The general black market already occupies a position similar to the official black market. There is a black market in this official black market, so there is a so-called black black market. Since the hoarding methods are so complicated, it is hoped that the authorities will fully consider this point when conducting the thorough investigation.

(4) The Materials Investigation Committee also includes key Japanese military and political figures representing the General Headquarters, the Embassy, the Gendarmerie, and the Municipal Council. This is the reason why the people have expectations for the committee. At the same time, since the first thorough investigation, a lively public opinion has been seen. They will definitely be concerned about the future investigation, and they hope to realize the Sino-Japanese military, government, and people's cooperative system and establish an institution that accepts public criticism in good faith. The official has permanent laws and organizations such as the hoarding crime punishment regulations, the main commodity registration rules, and the materials investigation committee. It is also hoped that a permanent civil organization that can provide planned assistance will be established as soon as possible, such as a price issue research association, etc., so as to provide opinions to the Materials Investigation Committee at any time, and officials and the people can reach a consensus to solve the hoarding problem. This is the urgent task. (Cloud Peng: Translated from the May 15th Mainland News)
