### Miscellaneous Shanghai Society Matters

In the past hundred years, Shanghai's history has exerted a significant impact on the entire country in terms of politics, economy, and culture. Therefore, Shanghai's every move and stillness can be said to be closely related to the whole country. In the past, Shanghai was a disguised colony of the great powers. Therefore, its essence was inconsistent with Chinese culture, especially the hidden growth of extravagant customs, which resulted in a negative impact on the inland, causing concern among those who care. Now, due to the Greater East Asia War and Japan's implementation of a new policy toward China, the return of Shanghai's concessions is about to be realized. Therefore, Shanghai, which has existed for a hundred years, is approaching a time of changing its essence. Some of the advantages and characteristics of the past will be maintained and developed, while all evil factors and unreasonable phenomena must be completely eliminated. Regarding the overall and more important issues, we will leave them for discussion on another day. Today, we will first present three current unreasonable phenomena and hope that the authorities will pay attention to them. If improvements can be made quickly, it will be a blessing for the country and society.

The first contradictory and unreasonable phenomenon concerns the aspect of conserving resources. The most important thing is power. For various wartime needs, the conservation and consumption of resources are subject to control. We absolutely agree with this. However, in the process of control and conservation, we see that the first to be affected are general factories and other production organizations. Due to the limited supply of electricity, the productivity of various production organizations cannot be fully utilized. Machinery, manpower, raw materials, etc., are not fully mobilized. As a result: (1) the quantity of products is reduced, contributing to the shortage of social materials and rising prices; (2) manpower and resources are idle. Most production organizations have to lay off employees. Technical talents seek other ways to maintain their livelihoods, and talents are wasted; (3) at the same time, a large number of workers are idle and unemployed, creating factors of social unrest; (4) because production cannot be fully developed, the funds already invested in the production sector, in order to avoid being "idle", change their direction, jump out of the production sector, and engage in hoarding and speculation. This is conserving where it should not be conserved. However, on the other hand, in every large hotel, restaurant, dance hall, and club, etc., electric lights are on all night, and singing and music continue until dawn. There are still many such places, and the electricity consumed for entertainment is countless. If we were to calculate the amount of electricity consumed in this way, the figure would be staggering. In addition to the consumption of electricity, it encourages bad social habits, wastes manpower and resources, and violates wartime life, not to mention other consequences. This is not conserving where it should be conserved. Today, we specifically bring this up, hoping that the authorities will take effective measures as soon as possible. All consumption of electricity should be strictly limited, and electricity for production should be supplied as much as possible. In the future, the benefits will be immeasurable!

The second thing that deserves special attention is the unreasonable phenomenon of wartime life for citizens. On the one hand, there is the suffering of the vast middle and lower classes of citizens. The small citizens and workers who are all production participants, the public officials and cultural workers (including elementary school teachers) who are all executors and promoters of national policies, they are truly bearing the heavy burden of the war and suffering the difficult life brought about by the war. On the other hand, the general non-productive, profit-sharing speculators indulge in extravagant enjoyment. All the markets for luxury goods, all the luxurious restaurants, hotels, and entertainment venues, and all the "prosperity" of Shanghai seem to exist only to supply these non-producers and speculators. Under this extremely contradictory phenomenon, the so-called vigorously implementing a new wartime national life completely loses its meaning. Moreover, due to the existence of this contradictory phenomenon, it invisibly stimulates and encourages the general public's psychology of speculation, fraud, and taking risks, because as long as there is speculation and fraud, one can escape the life of hardship and enjoy oneself to the fullest. Even if one unfortunately fails, one will only return to the present life of being neither full nor starving! This is such a serious phenomenon. We hope that the authorities will quickly devise appropriate countermeasures, ban all luxurious and extravagant lifestyles and actions that violate the wartime system, eliminate this contradictory and unreasonable phenomenon, and strive to achieve the ideal of "fairness." At the same time, we also hope that the leaders of society will conduct self-examination and vigorously practice thrift. This newspaper advocated for "saving on public banquets" on June 5th, and for a time, business leaders responded enthusiastically and added opinions, creating a trend that had the potential to become a prevailing fashion. It is hoped that all leaders, in addition to personally practicing it, will also widely promote and implement it, striving to make it universal, so that everyone will regard extravagance as shameful. Then Shanghai may be able to change its past face and become a model for the new life of the whole country.

The third issue is the pervasive presence of homeless children in the city's streets, which is most heartbreaking. Because as everyone knows, children are the lifeblood of the country. To know the future destiny of the country, one must look at how children are educated today. At present, due to the impact of the war, general middle- and lower-class families are already unable to afford the education expenses of their children. The children of wealthy families are accustomed to playing and have no interest in learning. The most pitiful are the children of those who have lost their families due to the impact of the war. They have no food or clothing, let alone education. So they wander the streets. The better ones wander through the alleys with a basket and tongs, picking up scraps and leftovers to supplement the household income. The worse ones become child beggars, perishing through starvation. Those who are smarter and stronger may become petty thieves or rob women and children, forming gangs and committing crimes to survive. Regardless of which type, they are all consuming the nation's vitality and creating factors of social unrest. The Municipal Council has a Children's Protection Section, and various charitable organizations seem to have institutions for receiving and teaching children, but they are either limited by laws or lack funds, and they have the regret of "how can we obtain tens of millions of spacious houses" for the vast number of homeless children in society. Recently, the World Red Swastika Society has established a Shanghai Civilian Training Center to take in displaced people and beggars, which is truly a great act of charity. However, we believe that the need to take in and educate homeless children is more urgent than that of adult displaced people, and it is especially important in terms of political and social significance. We sincerely hope that the relevant parties will pay attention to this and quickly plan to take in and educate them, to preserve a few more points of vitality for the country, which is also to eliminate a few more points of crisis for society, and it is not just a small problem of outward appearance.

Shanghai is still the place where the nation's attention is focused. As this fundamental transformation is about to begin, we will first seek the attention and improvement of all parties regarding the lighter and easier matters, as a prelude to the new life of the city and a model for the new life of the nation. Otherwise, if the light and easy matters cannot be handled, how can we talk about the heavy and big ones?

### The Imperial Headquarters Announced Yesterday Afternoon The War Results of the Army and Navy Air Forces Heavily Bombed Darwin and New Guinea More Than 40 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down and Damaged

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial Headquarters announced at 12:00 on the 29th: (A) The Imperial Army Air Force attacked Darwin Port, the enemy air force base in northwestern Australia, on June 20th and 22nd. The situation is as follows: (1) On June 20th, it engaged more than 40 enemy fighter planes, shot down 27 of them, destroyed 3 on the ground, and shattered several enemy barracks and airfield facilities. Six fires broke out in several places. Our losses were three self-detonations. (2) On June 22nd, the fighter squadron attacked the area again. The enemy planes and anti-aircraft fire were silent and did not fight. All our planes returned safely. (B) The Imperial Army Air Force attacked the enemy airfield near Lae, New Guinea Island, on June 20th and 21st, with the following results: (1) On June 20th, three enemy planes were damaged on the ground in Lae, with no losses on our side. (2) On June 21st, an encounter battle occurred with more than 20 enemy planes in the airspace near Salamaua, and eight of them were shot down and three were damaged. One of our planes has not yet returned.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to New Golden Mountain Telegram: The Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Military Headquarters announced that the Japanese Air Force heavily bombed Darwin Port on the 28th.

Japan Completes New Operational Posture in the Pacific

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - In February of this year, the Japanese army in the Pacific began to prepare a new operational posture in order to promote a new strategy, which has now been completed. The Japanese Army Air Force has been echoing the Navy Air Force in air raids on Darwin Port for days. The significance in wartime is as follows: (1) The preparation of strategic points and important frontlines of the Japanese army has been fully completed. (2) The Japanese Army Air Force has directly bombed Darwin Port. (3) The war situation in that area has entered a new stage due to this bombing.

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - The air battle in the South Pacific is now becoming increasingly fierce. With the Japanese Army and Navy aircraft echoing each other, they recently launched two major air raids on Darwin Port, the enemy's largest base in northwestern Australia, inflicting heavy damage and deepening the threat to the enemy's position. In order to completely destroy Darwin Port, the enemy's frontline base in Australia, the Japanese Army aircraft attacked the port on June 20th with a combined large formation of fighter-bombers. The Japanese aircraft arrived at 10:20 am. More than 40 enemy Spitfire fighter planes also took off to meet the battle. A major air battle then unfolded over Darwin Port. Soon after the engagement, the Japanese aircraft shot down 27 enemy aircraft. On the other hand, the Japanese bombers launched a fierce bombing of the enemy barracks area, causing a large fire. The airfield and storage facilities in the eastern part of the port were also completely destroyed by the bombing. The enemy's losses in this battle were really great. On the 22nd, when the Japanese Army aircraft attacked Darwin Port again with a large formation of fighters, not a single enemy aircraft was seen taking off to respond, and the ground artillery was also completely silent. The weakness of the enemy's war situation can be seen from this. Recently, the number of enemy aircraft in Darwin Port was about 60 to 70, but not a single one responded on the 22nd. Therefore, it can be inferred that Darwin Port suffered heavy damage this time. In addition, on the way back after the Japanese Army aircraft raided Australia on the 20th, they discovered three enemy twin-engine bombers at the Wau airport in New Guinea and damaged them. On the 21st, on the way to attack the enemy base, they encountered more than 20 enemy fighter planes in the airspace over Salamaua. As a result of the battle, in addition to shooting down eight, they also damaged a total of three, and the rest escaped. In the South Pacific, due to the hard work of the Guadalcanal support troops, an excellent strategic situation has been established. Now, due to the joint bombing of enemy bases by the Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces, destroying the enemy's reinforcement route and attacking the enemy air force base, the enemy air force has been completely overwhelmed. The air decisive battle in the South Pacific can determine the future evolution of the war situation. In view of the recent increase in aircraft production in Japan, it can be known that this air decisive battle will be more favorable to Japan in the future.

### A Large Number of Enemy Properties in Hankou, Xiamen, and Guangdong Transferred by the Japanese Side to Our Country for Management A Total of 461 Items

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) - After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the relationship between China and Japan entered a stage of shared life and death.

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) - Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the friendly country of Japan has repeatedly decided to transfer the enemy properties of the British and American enemy countries to the National Government of China for management in order to respect China's sovereignty and territory. Yesterday, the 461 enemy properties in Hankou, Xiamen, and Guangdong that had been investigated were officially handed over to the National Government for the second time. Minister Chu and the authorities of the Japanese Embassy made speeches. The following is a record:

### Minister Chu's Speech

Since the Greater East Asia War, the friendly country of Japan has seized and dealt with the property of the enemy countries and enemy legal entities in our country, such as the United Kingdom and the United States. After our country declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States, the friendly country of Japan, based on the principle of respecting our country's sovereignty and cooperating in completing the war, made a special statement to return the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. On February 8th of this year, the enemy properties that had been sorted out and scattered in various parts of Central and North China, totaling more than 1,000 items, were formally transferred to the National Government for management. Today, the 461 enemy properties in Hankou, Xiamen, and Guangdong that have been investigated and completed are formally transferred to the National Government for management for the second time. We are deeply grateful for the repeated good intentions of the friendly country of Japan. Among the enemy properties transferred to the National Government for management for the second time, such as the Hankou Electric Light Company, Peace Yanghang, Longmao Yanghang, Huachang University, Boxue Middle School, Puai Hospital, Yongfu Company of Xiamen. Hefeng Co., Ltd. Baoci Hospital, Sincere Company of Guangdong, Bunnemun Warehouse, Lingnan University and Farm, Mimei Hospital, etc., are all important British and American enterprises and cultural facilities in the Far East. After our country takes over, it will handle them properly and operate them well, in order to help our country's industrial revitalization and the development of education and culture, and further cooperate in completing the Greater Laiya War.

### Speech by the Authorities of the Japanese Embassy

Based on the fundamental spirit of adjusting national relations, and from the standpoint of respecting China's sovereignty and territory, the Imperial Government has decided on the policy of returning the concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights. At the time when the National Government declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States, it made necessary consultations and decided to implement them. Regarding the enemy properties seized by the Japanese military, it was also decided to transfer them to the National Government for management based on the same point of view. On February 8th, more than 1,000 enemy properties in the Central China region (excluding Hankou) and the North China region that had been investigated for the first time were notified of the completion of the transfer, and preparations were made for the implementation of the transfer at the same time as the notification. A total of 771 items, 110 in the Central China region and 661 in the North China region, which is three-quarters of the total enemy property, have been transferred. The remaining one-quarter is also being prepared and is scheduled to be implemented in the near future. On the other hand, the authorities concerned are also investigating the Hankou, Xiamen, and Guangdong regions. Except for some parts that have not been clarified, the investigation has been completed in general, and we are very pleased to be able to make a second transfer announcement today. These enemy properties include one or two items in the Hankou area, one or two items in the Xiamen area, and two or two items in the Guangdong area, for a total of 461 items. Other items include the Hankou Electric Light Company, Peace Yanghang, Longmao Yanghang, the residence managed by Peace Yanghang, Huachang University, Boxue Middle School, Puai Hospital, etc., Yongfu Company in Xiamen, Peace Co., Ltd., Xiamen Club, Baoci Hospital, Sincere Company in Guangdong, International Friendship Society, Bunnemun Warehouse, Lingnan University and the university's farm, Mimei Church Hospital, etc., including the important British and American enterprises and cultural facilities in China in the past. With the transfer and return of these enemy properties, the National Government will be able to use them to counter the long-term economic and cultural aggression of the United Kingdom and the United States, and will surely actively cooperate in the common completion of the Greater East Asia War. We always believe in this without any doubt.

### Minister Zhou Calls Meeting in Hankou for Lectures to Tax Personnel in Three Provinces

Hankou, 29th (Central News Agency) - The 29th was the second day that Zhou Fohai, Minister of Finance and President of the Central Reserve Bank, visited Hankou. On the morning of the same day, Zhou, in his capacity as Minister of Finance and Revenue, personally visited the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance in the three provinces of Yu, E, and Gan at 9:30 am, and summoned all staff members, the directors of the three bureaus of salt and tobacco, and all senior personnel above to give lectures in the auditorium of the office. The main points are as follows: (1) In the past, a temporary reorganization committee for finance in the three provinces was established in response to the environment at that time. Now, because the mission has been completed, it will be reorganized, and a special commissioner's office of the Ministry of Finance will be established to meet the new needs and assume a new mission. I hope that you colleagues will continue to work hard. (2) At present, although national expenditures have increased due to the environment, the authorities have not issued public bonds, but rely entirely on tax revenue. Therefore, the national finances are very stable. Since the National Government participated in the war, many undertakings have been handled and require economic support, but the authorities do not want to cause inflation and are making every effort to prevent its expansion. Therefore, the responsibility is even greater in the future. We must strive to increase tax revenue and, on the one hand, enable the exchange of materials and increase production. Therefore, the Central Government has established the Central Materials Review Committee and the General Association for Commercial Control for unified management. On the one hand, it should enable the people to bear the average expenditure borne by the people, and strive to close the gap between the country's income, so that the country's finances can be developed in a healthy manner. We need to be careful in everything, take into account the current situation, and especially work hard in our own positions to complete our mission. (3) At present, the general life is very difficult, and prices are rising continuously. The authorities have also formulated countermeasures to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. Moreover, as the world situation is changing rapidly, not only are the people of the warring countries feeling difficult in their lives, but the people of neutral countries are also encountering the same situation. Therefore, in this transitional period of the great era, everyone should continue to work hard with patience and pain, so that the country's tax revenue can be increased, and the general economic life can be stabilized. The tone was calm, the intention was sincere, and the encouragement was added, which lasted for 20 minutes.

### Anti-Axis Powers Attempt to Invade Europe - Date of Launch Allegedly Decided - Stalin Urges Opening of Second Front

Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports from London that British officials in Downing Street, in conversations with foreign reporters, hinted that July 3rd has been chosen as the date for the Anti-Axis invasion of Europe. While the reliability of this information cannot be verified, three different sources in Stockholm, Sweden, have confirmed this rumor, suggesting that it was released with the permission of British intelligence. It is expected that the dissemination of this rumor will have a significant psychological effect on the British public, as they were disappointed by the failure to launch the invasion on June 22nd and by reports on Saturday that Stalin has again questioned whether Britain and the United States are willing to carry out this invasion. According to reliable sources, all Soviet diplomats in Britain and the United States received instructions on Friday to use every possible means to urge the realization of Stalin's proposed invasion. At the same time, British and American correspondents in Moscow were earnestly requested by Soviet intelligence to emphasize in their dispatches the opinion of the Soviet people that the invasion of Europe was promised in 1942 and must be launched within the next few days. The extent to which Moscow's new actions will influence British and American military plans remains unknown, but it is clear that the July 3rd date mentioned in London will provide temporary reassurance to the impatient Soviets.

Rome Discusses Invasion Routes

Rome, 29th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports that the question of where the Anti-Axis forces plan to land in Europe has become a subject of much discussion here. From a general military perspective, the Anti-Axis forces must, at the very least, occupy Sicily before attempting a landing anywhere in Europe. It is believed here that, in theory, the Anti-Axis armies could potentially pass through Spain or Turkey, but this would amount to openly violating the neutrality that both countries are striving to maintain. If these two possibilities are ruled out, there are three other possible routes for an invasion of Europe: southern France, the Balkans, and the Italian mainland. While the Anti-Axis forces may be able to successfully land on the Mediterranean coast of France, the transport of landing troops and supplies via a long sea route should not be overlooked. Moreover, the specialized vessels used for landing are generally small in tonnage and cannot cross the sea from North African bases in 24 hours, and they must also guard against attacks from Axis air and naval forces along the way. Therefore, even if the Anti-Axis forces manage to land successfully, their lines of communication will be constantly threatened, not to mention the considerable distance from the landing site to the Axis countries' home territories and the resistance they will have to overcome along the way. In order to minimize the threat from the air, the Anti-Axis countries must first occupy Sardinia and Corsica to be successful. Regarding an invasion through the Balkans, there are not only difficulties with long sea lines of communication but also the need to occupy all the islands in the Aegean Sea, without which success would be impossible. All of the Anti-Axis forces' reinforcements and supplies will need to be transported through the Mediterranean, as detouring around Africa would be too far. To ensure the safety of this transport, the occupation of Sicily will be necessary. The Anti-Axis armies have little hope of obtaining assistance from organized guerrilla forces in the Balkans or gaining access to the Romanian oilfields, and the terrain there is treacherous, making it easier for the Axis forces to attack from all sides. Rome believes that it would be logical for the Anti-Axis forces to capture Sicily, otherwise, success would be difficult to achieve. People here believe that Britain and the United States are likely to proceed in this manner.

### Soviets Mass Troops Southwest of Moscow

Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Central News Agency) – The German and Soviet armies on the Eastern Front have been engaged in intense positional warfare centered on the Velikiye Luki region west of Moscow. Since the 27th, the fighting has expanded north to the Kholm region and south to the Demidov region, with the front line stretching for 200 kilometers. The terrain in this area is extremely unfavorable, with numerous rivers, lakes, and marshes, but the German army is fighting fiercely despite the adverse conditions. The main Soviet force is positioned in the Kholm region. The German army received significant reinforcements and launched a strong attack against the Soviet forces, inflicting heavy casualties and driving them back. The current situation of the German front line in the Kholm region is unknown. Intense positional warfare is also taking place in other areas, including southwest of Sukhinichi, Mtsensk, Izium, Bely Gorod, and the Kupiansk bridgehead. The Soviet army is currently massing approximately 100 to 190 divisions of tanks and mechanized units west and southwest of Moscow.

### Japanese Government Adopts Measures to Increase Food Production

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government's measures to increase food production focus on rice production. The prices of rice both domestically and abroad have already been moderately increased to make rice farming more profitable. In the previous extraordinary session of the Diet, it was also decided to designate the manufacture of fertilizers and agricultural machinery as one of the five key industries. This is to ensure rice production. Temporary measures to increase food production have also been adopted, including efforts to reclaim land for paddy fields and various other measures related to increasing rice production. The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry expects this year's rice production target to be the same as last year, at 73.59 million koku, with 3.18 million hectares of paddy fields planted nationwide. However, the most important factor is the planting situation. According to reports, rice transplanting has already been completed in Hokkaido and the Tohoku region of Japan, and it is actively underway west of Kanto. With ample water, the overall planting situation is progressing smoothly, and the planned planting schedule is expected to be completed successfully.

### American Sense of Racial Superiority Is the Fuse of War - Japanese People Do Not Forget the July 1st Day of Shame - East Asian Nations Should Make Further Efforts

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – July 1st is a day that the Japanese people will never forget, as it was the day 19 years ago (1924) when the United States suddenly implemented the Japanese Exclusion Act, insulting Japan. The United States has always chanted the principles of freedom and equality, but for 19 years until today, it has always practiced its racial inequality. Not only Japan has suffered the shame of this racial inequality. Chinese people have also been subjected to this cruel exclusion act. Such insult to the people of East Asia and aggression against the land of East Asia is the traditional ambition of the United States. Therefore, the distant cause of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War was planted in this Japanese Exclusion Act. The indignation of the Japanese people is now tied closely to the Greater East Asia War. In order to defeat Britain and the United States, to crush their insatiable greed and their malicious schemes, they have risen up in unity. China and Japan cooperate, regarding the United States as a common enemy, and striving to complete the Greater East Asia War, the reason is also in this. Therefore, on this July 1st, all the nations of East Asia must be more alert and make further efforts.

Mr. Tsurumi Talks About the Past

When the United States implemented this tyrannical Japanese Exclusion Act 19 years ago, Japanese House of Representatives member Yusuke Tsurumi traveled to the United States to clarify Japan's righteousness. Today, in order to make the world understand the indignation of the Japanese people at that time and the tyranny and unreasonableness of the United States, he specifically talked about the process as follows: The so-called Japanese Exclusion Act implemented by the United States on July 1, 1924, was an unreasonable law established by the United States for immigrants from all countries in the world. The intention was to exclude the British, so immigrants at that time were limited to within a hundred people. However, thereafter, when amending the law, the proposal to completely prohibit Japanese immigration was made to the National Assembly. Japan had protested to the United States against this because this kind of discriminatory treatment was unbearable for Japan. However, due to the results of false propaganda and the abuse of Japan by the unscrupulous politicians of California and other states, this discriminatory treatment was finally passed by the Congress. Seventeen years ago, Japan and the United States had concluded a so-called Gentlemen's Agreement, and the government, based on this agreement, automatically restricted immigration to the United States and abided by it. However, the United States disregarded this 17-year-old covenant and prohibited Japanese people from entering the country for no reason at all. At that time, the Japanese government ordered its ambassador to the United States, Masanao Hanihara, to warn the United States that if the law was passed, there would be "serious consequences," but because of the propaganda of American agitators, Article 12 of the Immigration Act was finally passed in Congress. Although the law never expressly stated that it was for Japanese people, it said that "foreigners who cannot be naturalized under the Constitution are prohibited from entering the country." Its constitution stipulates that "Orientals may not be naturalized as Americans." Because Indians and Chinese were already prohibited from entering the country before this, this article clearly referred to Japanese people. We call this the Japanese Exclusion Act because of this. Since that day, not a single Japanese worker has been able to enter the United States, so the people of Japan are all indignant.

Delivered More Than 100 Speeches in the United States

Before this, Japan had never taken any inappropriate measures against the United States. However, what the United States had imposed on Japan was this kind of unreasonable discriminatory treatment. As a result, I had received telegrams from 37 universities in the United States, requesting that I go to the United States to speak and explain the Japanese people's views on this immigration law. I spent a year and a half in the United States, during which I gave more than 150 presentations on this issue. I still remember what I said at the time: In the past, there had never been any events between Japan and the United States that would hinder diplomatic relations. Trade and cultural exchange were all friendly. However, due to the implementation of the Immigration Act, a major mark has been created in the friendly history of Japan and the United States. If the United States does not amend this law as soon as possible, I dare to say that serious consequences will arise in the future. I said that the fundamental reason for implementing this Immigration Act was neither an economic issue, nor a cultural or legal issue, it was clearly an attack on Japanese people and it was a racial issue. This in fact originated from the American's sense of racial superiority, and their so-called justice, humanity, freedom, and equality, were just a facade. If we look at the United States domestically, we know that they do everything possible to oppress other colored people. The way the United States treats black people is a good example. They are in fact indebted to black people, but they forget their ancestors and turn kindness into hatred. California's prosperity today is due to whose gift? If there were no Japanese farmers, would there be today? However, the United States does not allow Japanese immigrants to have land ownership rights, only granting them a three-year short-term lease. After three years, when the barren land becomes a paradise, it is immediately taken back. In elementary schools, Japanese outstanding children are not only appointed as class leaders, even though Japanese youths graduate from American universities, they are not employed by American companies and commercial houses. California Americans who have married Japanese expatriates resort to all means, using all means to force the United States to take this extremely inhumane action. But as soon as they go to China, they chant justice and humanity, and attack the Japanese government one by one. This is in fact the fuse that the United States itself ignited for the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the only way to truly defeat the anti-Asian Immigration Act is to win the Greater East Asia War. Only when we complete the war can we make them abandon their sense of racial superiority. The Anglo-Saxon's egocentric sense of superiority is in fact an obstacle to human equality, freedom, and happiness. Therefore, the day their sense of superiority is shattered is the day the first page of the new world history unfolds.

### Curfew on the Huangpu River Advanced to Earlier Time Every Night

Pudong and Puxi are separated by a river, and citizens rely on ferries to travel back and forth. In recent years, the commercial prosperity of the Pudong area has led to a large number of citizens traveling back and forth every day. In the past, water traffic on the Huangpu River was prohibited after 12:00 every night. According to a report from the Central News Agency, the authorities, in order to ensure the security of Pudong and the Huangpu River, have readjusted the water curfew time from the other day, changing it from 8:00 pm every night to the next morning. Any ship is prohibited from sailing

### Student Aid Registration Soon, Sincere Appeal for Donations, Past Achievements Have Been Understood by All Circles, At This Moment, We Cannot Bear to Sit Idly By

The 5th Shenbao Reader Student Aid Fund will begin issuing application forms tomorrow. (Note the dates for students in each group to submit their forms, as indicated on the form). There are two types of forms: for those who have previously received assistance and for first-time applicants. Those who have previously received assistance from this newspaper must fill in the amount of assistance received in previous years and their academic performance this semester in detail for auditing and overall assessment. First-time applicants are especially requested to complete the procedures properly, which will make it easier to apply for the next time.

Old Students to Submit a Personal Statement

All students who have received assistance in the past at the junior high, high school, vocational school, and university levels should, in accordance with the daily announcements in this newspaper and the submission dates announced today, attach an essay entitled "Personal Statement," describing the student's family situation and academic experience. The word count should be around 500 words, and it must be a truthful account, avoiding generalizations. Selected essays will be published in this newspaper.

Earnestly Hope for Generous Donations from All Circles

This newspaper has repeatedly appealed for donations from all circles to this year's student aid fund. People from all walks of life also believe that the intellectual deprivation of outstanding students from poor families should be addressed more urgently than general poverty. Those students who have received assistance are like plants that have been fertilized and sprouted. This year, we should help them complete their studies. How can we bear not to provide assistance at the time of their budding and watch them suffer from wind and rain again? If, unfortunately, they have to drop out of school due to financial difficulties, it is the fault of those working on the student aid fund in this newspaper for not being effective enough, and it is something that people from all walks of life cannot bear to watch. The colleagues, aware of the large number of students awaiting assistance, can only continue to make a sincere appeal to all sectors of society.

Uniform Handling of Tuition-Free Quotas

The authorities of major and minor schools have enthusiastically supported this newspaper's student aid movement during this difficult period, donating tuition-free places to benefit young people. We are deeply grateful. We have received many requests this year. In order to ensure uniform admission, please send letters indicating the number of tuition-free places donated by each school. The number of places is not fixed, but it should be based on the full exemption of tuition fees. Those who intend to set up half-fee places will be transferred to the Social Service Department for processing individually, so as not to affect the time for the entire student aid examination and investigation due to procedural reasons. If you can reduce the number of half-fee places in each school by half and change them to full tuition-free places, we would be especially grateful.

Registration Dates for Students in Each Group

The distribution of application forms will be from the 1st to the 5th. Applicants should not ask others to collect the forms on their behalf. After completing the application form, they should come to the office in person to register on time according to the following schedule:

Elementary School Group July 6th to 11th (Grades 5 and 6)

Junior High School Group 9th to 14th

Senior High School Group 12th to 17th

University Group 15th to 20th

### Strictly Prohibit Raising Salt Prices in Shanghai, No Increase Allowed Above 1.25 Yuan per Market Catty

The Songjiang District Salt Affairs Administration notified that any increase or decrease in the price of salt sold in various places should be submitted by the local salt affairs authorities to the ministry for approval and implementation. This year, a notice was issued to all jurisdictions regarding the approved increase in the price of salt sold and the retail price of salt for uniform compliance. Now, it has been learned that some soy sauce workshops in Shanghai have raised the retail price of salt to 1.80 yuan per market catty, or have varying prices, which is a disregard for the law. This bureau has a responsibility to correct it immediately and prevent increasing the burden on the people. In addition to ordering the Yuhua Salt Industry Company and the Shanghai Soy Sauce and Wine Industry Association, this notice is issued to all soy sauce workshops and salt shops to comply with the previous price approved by this bureau. The highest retail price per market catty should not exceed 0.225 Japanese yen, which is equivalent to 1.25 yuan in current legal tender. Without the re-determined price by this bureau, it is not allowed to raise the price without authorization, in order to comply with the law. If anyone dares to deliberately violate the law, once verified, they will be dealt with severely and will not be tolerated. Everyone should comply with this.

Mr. Wen Lanting, at the advanced age of seventy, strives to serve society. Last year, he fell ill due to overwork. After his illness, his energy has not yet recovered, but guests continue to visit and socialize like clouds, which greatly affects his health. Colleagues published a small notice on his behalf on May 13th, informing all circles that he would decline evening banquets and visits. Now that the weather is gradually warming, in order to uphold Mr. Lan's principle of light diet and health care, and with Mr. Lan's consent, from July 1st onwards, all lunch banquets will also be declined. Please be informed.

She came to the radio station on the afternoon of June 16th to assist with the broadcast and disaster relief, showing great enthusiasm for charity.

### Moscow Citizens' Gardens

Mr. Yanaka, a special correspondent for the Asahi Shimbun in Moscow, reported to the head office on June 1st of this year about the recent situation in Moscow. Among them, the part about the Moscow citizens opening up city land for farming caused endless emotions. The report has this paragraph. "During the reporter's stay in Moscow, I not only did not hear a single air raid alarm, but I simply did not feel that there was a war that directly threatened the peaceful life of the citizens... The roads to Moscow two years ago were densely covered with tank trenches and fortresses to defend the capital... But today, revisiting the old place, the tank trenches and fortresses have all become citizens' gardens... Now the citizens of Moscow are dividing the roads and city streets leading from the suburbs to the city into farmland for cultivation... There are countless people queuing in front of bookstores to buy single-volume books and pamphlets on horticulture. It is said that the total number of citizen gardens visible everywhere in the city is more than 33,249, and the areas around eye-catching high-rise buildings such as Gorky Street have been transformed into farms... Because the citizens suffered from a lack of vegetables in the past three winters, they started this activity to seek self-sufficiency."

The people of Moscow, after undergoing a baptism of blood, have begun to engage in city land gardening in order to remedy the food panic in case of emergency. Comparing the enthusiasm for increased production in Moscow gardens with the enthusiasm for speculation and waste in Shanghai is truly shameful. Moscow citizens are queuing to buy single-volume books and pamphlets on horticulture, while Shanghai citizens are queuing to buy various rationed cigarettes. May I ask, what can cigarettes produce? There are as many as 33,400 citizen gardens in Moscow, may I ask, how many home gardens and farms do Shanghai citizens have? I hope that Shanghai citizens, especially those with large flower gardens at home, will reflect on themselves, and at the same time, I hope that local authorities will instruct the police or patrols not to obstruct the conversion of private gardens into gardens, because this is a way to remedy the food shortage.

### Central Reserve Bank Accepts Banking Industry Suggestions, Plans to Formulate Measures to Facilitate Counterparts

After the Central Reserve Bank took over the clearing and transfer of funds for the liquidation of the Hua Shang Exchange Bank, in order to facilitate the collection and disbursement of funds by counterparts and simplify procedures, it has accepted the suggestions of the banking industry and plans to formulate specific measures, which will be notified to various banks for implementation after approval. The suggestions of the bank are recorded as follows:

(1) "Cash withdrawal" should be changed to allow each exchange shareholder to issue a current deposit check when cash is needed, with "Pay in cash" indicated on the back of the check and affixed with a formal signature. The original cumbersome procedure of using a remittance slip and canceling the remittance slip separately on the same day should be eliminated to simplify the process. (2) "Collection" Regarding the transfer time of remittance slips, Saturday should be extended to 2:00 pm. The original regulations allowed for acceptance before 5:00 pm every day and before 12:00 pm on Saturdays. The daily business hours should be extended by 2 hours, and Saturdays should also be extended by 2 hours to facilitate interbank transfers. (3) "Collection" Regarding the exchange bank's receipt of entrusted agency exchange bank instruments, which cannot be sent to the Silver Union for entrusted collection, but can only be submitted to the Silver Union for exchange, another regulation should be added: "Entrusted agency exchange bank instruments should be submitted to the Silver Union for exchange and cannot be directly deposited into this bank or entrusted to the Silver Union for collection." (4) "Payment" Regarding the return of remittance slips issued daily to each bank for cancellation and exchange of current deposit checks, in order to reduce accounting procedures, they were originally distributed to each bank for cancellation in the morning of the next day. However, during the bank's closing and settlement period, it should be stipulated that the current day's cancellation and exchange of current deposit checks should be returned in order to facilitate the handling of settlement and closing matters. (5) "Returned checks" should also stipulate that settlement and closing procedures should be completed on the same day. (6) "Liquidation" Regarding the return of certificates to each bank for record, it should also be stipulated that they must be returned to each bank on the same day during the settlement and closing period for certification. (7) Insufficient funds, originally with no time limit, should be supplemented before 5:30 pm every day and before 2:30 pm on Saturdays, and each bank should be allowed to supplement them with cash deposits.

### Protecting Draft Cattle for Increased Food Production During Wartime

In order to adapt to the wartime food production increase plan, the central government has issued an order prohibiting the slaughter of draft cattle, which has been implemented. It is learned that in order to further and effectively protect draft cattle in rural areas, the Ministry of Food will require a certificate for the transportation of draft cattle in the future before they are allowed to pass, in order to prevent theft and slaughter and reduce the rural production force.

### After Registration, Flour Mills Can Obtain an Allotment of Wheat with Proof

(Commercial Control Association News) The Commercial Control Association has decided to collect wheat in a unified manner and has already formulated a plan. The Powder and Wheat Special Committee of the association is responsible for supervising the implementation. In addition to the letter to the Grain Industry Federation by the wheat shops, vendors, and commissioned merchants, requesting them to register separately within the time limit, the flour mills are instructed to apply to the local Powder and Wheat Expert Committee Office for wheat registration, submit a qualified registration, and obtain a registration certificate, which must be completed within a limited time. Half of the time will be used to allocate wheat, and each flour mill will use it to manufacture flour. This matter concerns the people's food and the rights and interests of each factory. It is heard that the applicants are quite enthusiastic.

### Year-End Settlement Today, Banks and Money Shops to Take a Two-Day Holiday Tomorrow and the Day After

Therefore, each industry was able to safely and completely get through the settlement. Finance remains stable. It is heard that from the second half of the year, each bank and shop will be particularly cautious in its lending business. Applications will only be approved if it is indeed for legitimate purposes.

### Hua Stock Trends

Yesterday, Hua stocks started high and then turned low, and were almost hardening again after falling to the bottom. As the price of gold suddenly saw a retreat after soaring, it was the last day before the silver and money industry's semi-annual closing holiday. Investors were still more likely to sell for cash, and people's hearts were dazed. Most stocks ended up rising due to short covering, but the volume was not strong. The long-stagnant new pharmaceutical industry suddenly flourished. China-France rose the most sharply, and New Asia also followed suit. Five Continents, China-West, Sinopharm and others were all firm. The department store industry saw the sharpest fluctuations. Wing On, Sincere, and China National Goods companies each saw a large increase. The demand for underwear was high, and Jingfu and Jinglun shirts and socks were firm. The latter briefly broke through the big mark. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile stood firm outside the pass, and China Textile and Great China Weaving were excellent. The public utility industry was the most stagnant. In the cultural industry, World Book Co. alone was flat, while Commercial Press and Chung Hwa Book Co. both saw short covering. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco and Great China Match both reached new highs again. Jiu'an Industrial stood out through the big mark. Tongyi Trust, Defeng Knitting, and Zhongxing Timber were all in more demand than supply. Kang Yuan Can again approached the mark. The financial industry was consistently firm. It is also reported that the 1st and 2nd of next month are the semi-annual closing period for the silver and money industry. The European Common Market counterparts have decided to handle the settlement today and suspend the market for three days starting today, resuming business on July 3rd.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Gold and Silver: Gold shops in this city still redeem gold at the limited price, but the handling fee has increased again. There is no market for counterparts, and non-industry establishment is not strong. After the price soared, it suddenly retraced, but it still rose a lot more than the previous day. The off-market price of Sycee silver also saw an increase.

Public Bonds: The public bond black market also showed a trend of rising and then suddenly retracing, but it ended up higher than the previous day due to short covering.

Cotton Cloth: The cloth market continued the upward momentum of the previous day and continued to be excellent. Moreover, due to high demand and low supply, market prices rose steadily. However, at the close, there were many floats and various parties selling off, and people's hearts turned soft. As a result, it was higher than the previous day due to short covering. Longtou fine cloth was up more than thirty, Four Gentlemen were up yuan, Peach Blossom Women's Lin Bai Mao printed cloth, American Prim Color fine cloth, Bishishu Xiang, and Poplin all had factory orders to open, and prices were also excellent.

Cotton Yarn: Although the supply and demand for cotton yarn were both low, prices saw a sharp increase. 42-count double-stranded Panfeng and 32-count Double Horse Immortal Peach all broke through the big mark. 20-count Red Double Horse has also broken through the mark, but the price increase of 10-count Red Double Horse is weaker.

### Activities of Various Trade Associations

Goldsmiths: The Goldsmiths' Association was originally only organized by the "Da Tong Hang" (large goldsmiths), and the "Xiao Tong Hang" (small goldsmiths) and "Xin Tong Hang" (new goldsmiths) were never reported to the local authorities in Huai, so there was no association organization. Now, the association, in accordance with the instructions of the Feng authorities, has taken the initiative to adjust first, requiring members of the small and new goldsmiths to join the association. Registration has begun, dividing the large, small, and new goldsmiths into three groups: A, B, and C. Group A has twelve members, and Group B has thirteen, all of whom have joined. Group C, the new goldsmiths, are continuing to register with the association. At the same time, a petition has been submitted to the Economic Bureau to appoint initiators to be responsible for the adjustment.

Medical and Glory Trades: Since receiving the order to prepare for the establishment of the Vegetable Trade Association, they have begun to handle the registration of fellow traders joining the association. In recent days, vegetable and glory traders have flocked to apply for membership, which is quite prosperous. The deadline for this membership registration will be July 4th.

Noodle Making and Food Industry: Recently, the association stated that due to the wide area covered by the industry and the large scope of fellow traders, the original four branch offices were insufficient. Starting from July 1st, a branch office will be added in the leased area at 10 Mingde Lane, Bu Xi Hua De Road, Hongkou, and 27 Chunyi Lane, Maigen Road, Wuding Road. Shops engaged in the noodle making and cooked food industry can register at the nearest branch office.

### Brief News

Silk Industry Federation: Application for Transporting Tidy Garments. Inquiries revealed that silk, cotton, yarn, and interweaving products are commonly referred to as "Tidy Garments," which have always been one of the main commodities traded by silk shops. The National Commerce Association believes that the suspension of transportation of "Tidy Garments" has been a long time and hinders the flow of materials. Therefore, the request of the Silk Industry Federation is approved, allowing normal sales and transportation. However, the visa procedures should be strictly enforced. In addition to being signed by the industry association, it should also be certified by the Silk Industry Federation and then submitted to the Commerce Association for approval to issue a removal permit to be valid.

Public Welfare Progressive Society Holds Lecture: The Shanghai Public Welfare Progressive Society, organized by famous people from all walks of life in the city, aims to connect emotions and study knowledge.

After the meal, Mr. Liu lectured for 40 minutes, and then everyone dispersed happily.

### The Problem of Incompleteness

— Wu Min

Someone once mocked us, saying that we are a nation with only five minutes of enthusiasm. When starting something, everyone is incredibly enthusiastic, but when they encounter some setbacks or defeats and feel that it is not easy, their interest wanes. Slowly, they let the matter subside, or no one even mentions it anymore. These are all true, and there is no exaggeration, especially in this day and age. For example, if something is made a big deal, everyone feels righteously indignant and must do it well. But after a while, seeing that there is no effect, or there are some achievements, everyone does not ask or hear, as if they have already finished it. In reality? It is not so. It's just that more people are participating in the matter, but what will happen later is certainly not known. Probably as time goes on, the matter no longer feels serious, and no one will pursue the past again. Someone hears that he is doing something, doing something. The able ones work harder, doing this and that. He is doing this, he is doing that. Ask him if he has the ability to do one thing well and finish it? That is not necessarily the case, but he has already started doing another new one. Ask him if he is sure about the new thing? It is also very difficult to say. He is very happy when he starts, but after a while, he feels that it is not easy, or he is satisfied with some achievements, and he has no more interest, so he goes to do something else. The other is the same. He also feels that it is not easy, or he feels that he has some achievements and is satisfied, and he feels that he has no more interest, so he goes to find new things to do. He does everything like this, with no beginning and no end, giving up halfway, with a fluke mentality. As a result, he is doing everything, but he has not done anything well.

These are all suffering from the problem of incompleteness, like a person who feels pain here, so he goes to treat it here. Then he feels pain there, so he goes to treat it there. But he forgets that the pain here has not fully healed. It is important to take care of the new pain there, but at the same time, don't forget to relapse the old illness that is about to be cured. How to effectively plan to heal this and then start to treat the new disease that has arisen there? Or, for the sake of treating the new important one, don't forget to treat the old disease at the same time, so that the effort falls short. The new one is not good, and the old one is even worse.

### Summer Training for Teachers

— Ge Si

Introduction to the Summer Primary School Teacher Training Association

I heard such a fact from a friend.

"A female teacher who had just come out of school was in charge of singing and games in the lower grades. Because her teaching methods and materials were lively and novel, she was very popular with the children. Later, as time went on, the children's interest and feelings for her gradually decreased in inverse proportion. At this time, she felt very strange. One day, she heard several children criticizing like this: 'Mr. × always sings the same thing, what's the fun!'" She was silent.

What does this mean? The fact is very obvious. Children are progressing rapidly, while teachers are stuck in the past, stagnating and not moving forward. When this contradiction develops to the extreme, it manifests as the strange phenomenon learned above.

This is naturally a morbid state - an unhealthy strange phenomenon. The main reason is that teachers are too busy and their treatment is too poor, which affects the emotions and further studies of teachers. Therefore, if a teacher wants to gain the respect and love of children and be able to give children education that is in line with the times, further studies are absolutely necessary for themselves.

A year is easy, and the long summer vacation is coming. Primary school teachers should use this vacation to do beneficial elective studies. This year, the Shen Bao is acting in the spirit of social service and is preparing to hold a summer training session for primary school teachers during the summer vacation. It is entrusted to the Shanghai YWCA to handle it. The opening of such a training session is really good news for primary school teachers.

The most important thing in the training session is naturally the curriculum related to further studies in primary school education. This curriculum includes a total of seven courses: (1) Practical Problems of Primary School Administration, (2) Primary School Teaching Materials and Methods, (3) Education and Child Psychology, (4) School Children's Practical Mental Hygiene, (5) Compulsory Education Problems, (6) Primary School Training Problems, (7) Educational Principles. The teachers hired are all famous professors and education experts from universities in Shanghai. In addition to the curriculum, there are celebrity lectures and visits and discussions every week. For the sake of teachers' entertainment and physical and mental health, there are also sports (badminton, tennis, and swimming), singing, drama, and preparations for health checkups.

The address of the training session is located at the Shanghai Girls' High School on Tongfu Road, Dagu Road, which is a spacious and ideal school building.

### Road

— Hu Ruoliu

Road——

Placed before our eyes;

There are wide avenues,

There are rugged paths.

Think about it:

Which one should you choose?

Friend!

Don't be greedy for ease,

Don't be afraid of difficulties;

Wide avenues,

Take you into the abyss,

Grave;

Rugged paths,

You have to flatten yourself,

Transform.

One day, two days...

One year, two years...

Not afraid of difficulties,

Not afraid of hard work;

Turn the rugged into flat,

Turn the path into an avenue;

The rugged becomes flat!

The path becomes an avenue!

This is the "way to life"!

### Self-Blame and Sinners

— Qi Luo

"Self-blame," when explained from a good perspective, can enable us to reflect on our own mistakes, understand our own shortcomings, and encourage ourselves to conduct ourselves with an attitude of respecting others and learning from their strengths. In this way, we will seek progress in everything and benefit infinitely. Conversely, another kind of excessive "self-blame" is tantamount to self-abasement. We believe that we are incapable of doing anything, so we don't do it. Gradually, it creates a trend of fearing "life," escaping from reality, and being cowardly and retreating in everything. We believe that our every move is a criminal act, and we don't even dare to look people in the eye when walking on the street during the day, as if others are casting a contemptuous glance at him. Therefore, he has no peace all day long. What a pitiful and terrible "life" this is!

Needless to say, the "self-blame" we need is, of course, the former one.

Someone said, "People in the world can often only see the mistakes of others, but it is extremely difficult to discover their own shortcomings." This sentence means, "We can only blame sinners, but we cannot blame ourselves." In fact, sinners are not absolutely bad. If we can contribute extremely valuable opinions and go to blame sinners with a fairly friendly attitude in a "persuasive" way, then it may not be a good thing. However, in this society, there are many people who blame sinners in a "nitpicking" manner.

If we can spend some of the time we spend on blaming sinners on self-blame, then I believe it will be of great help to ourselves, to our families, and to society...

Movie Ramblings

### The Material Selection Route of National Films

— Zhao Ne

The output of national films has been the most prosperous in recent years. Because of the increase in output, the material selection has become chaotic. If we merge its lines, seventy to eighty percent belong to love stories of men and women, and less than one or two tenths can be considered educational and literary. The reason is that love films are easy to harvest in business, and the material selection is also convenient. Educational films are not only difficult to select materials and flow into "stereotyped" textbooks, but also suffer setbacks in business. Under such circumstances, everyone abandons the root and pursues the tip, trying their best to make the film imitate Hollywood's love comedies, or literary tragedies. Movies have also changed from educational tools to love textbooks.

If we compare the two plays "Good Night, Flowers, and Moonlight" and "Floating Clouds Covering the Moon," their material selection routes are the same. Everyone has some love for the American film style, and they all make a love story into a comedy. However, the achievement of "Good Night, Flowers, and Moonlight" seems to be higher than "Floating Clouds Covering the Moon." Because it has added a question. This question belongs to the social aspect, which is much more important than the question of the female secretary and the manager in "Floating Clouds Covering the Moon," and it is also more suitable in Chinese society. This proves that works grown on the same route still need to be added with nourishing fertilizer by the cultivators.

Secondly, in recent years, the material selection of national films has tried its best to focus on the dark side of the so-called upper class society. Although there are many evil things happening in high-rise buildings, they cannot get rid of the temptation of managers and young girls, and money... etc. This kind of "upper class society" darkness is still far away from the general small citizens. To know that the people who spend a lot of money to watch movies are 100% entertainment, and those who watch movies in third- and fourth-rate theaters can increase their knowledge in addition to entertainment. The dark side of the so-called lower class society is of course more cruel and painful than the "upper class." They hope that everyone will know, but films similar to this situation are rarely seen today. In the past, there were "Street Angel" and "City Night," which gained unprecedented value in film art. Now filmmakers can also pay attention to this point, and countless audiences are welcome. The best subject matter is none other than the "Zhang Jinhai Case," how the local ruffians who live in the dark side of society deceive and oppress. Although it is not based on this story, it is a good route for material selection.

After watching "Mother," everyone felt that it was an excellent subject matter. The themes of "Four Sisters" and "Three Flowers" are also good, but they seem to be far worse than "Mother." The reason is that the latter shifted the main line to another side, and the weight was immediately reduced. This is a place that producers should pay attention to, which is equivalent to performing "The True Story of Ah Q" and trying to make the audience laugh.

I hope that the material selection routes of domestic films in the future can be broader, and on each route, we can never forget to use the "educational tool" as the main trunk.

### Continued Report on the Disaster in Chaoshan

— Lv Yechu

Recently received a letter from relatives, describing the tragic situation of the disaster victims in the Chaoshan area, saying that the Chaoshan area has many mountains and little land, and the food supply is insufficient. The request for foreign rice relief has been requested. In recent years, due to traffic congestion, the food panic has become increasingly serious, especially in Chaoan, Chaoyang, and Chenghai counties. For several months, there has been no rain, the fields and crops have withered, and the land is red for thousands of miles. The early winter harvest has also been hopeless. Some people eat sweet potato leaves and tree bark because they cannot afford to buy rice. Some people are separated from their wives and children because they cannot find food. There are even more people who cannot endure the hunger and commit suicide by taking poison or drowning. All kinds of tragic situations are difficult to describe. Hundreds of people die of starvation every day. Recently, there has been a plague of tigers, and many people have died of heatstroke. The miserable people are suffering from this natural disaster and war. It is truly a case of misfortune never coming singly. I sincerely hope that our Chaozhou fellow villagers in Shanghai and those who are eager to help and charitable organizations will rise up to teach and help, so as to avoid the expansion of the disaster. This is the most sincere prayer.

### Feng Wenfeng's Charity Sale of Paintings and Calligraphy: All Proceeds Donated to Xin Pu Yu Tang

Starting from tomorrow (July 1st) to the 5th, a charity sale will be held at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Yu Qiaqing Road for five days. Excluding expenses, all proceeds will be donated to the hall. The lady's enthusiasm and righteous deeds are worthy of admiration. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will come to evaluate and appreciate, or purchase ink treasures, and participate in the charity event together.
