### The Mission of "Pro-Japanese Faction"

Some time ago, in a discussion on the two types of pro-Japanese factions, it was solemnly pointed out that a truly pro-Japanese faction is not only urgently needed under the current circumstances, but also very necessary in the construction of the future new China and the construction of the new Greater East Asia order. Judging from past facts, while there are indeed many who have joined the pro-Japanese camp out of purely self-interested motives, the majority are those who embrace revolutionary, patriotic, Japan-loving, and East Asia-loving sentiments, and who, based on their lofty vision and outstanding spirit, step forward to engage in Sino-Japanese cooperative enterprises. The general populace, having endured much suffering in the past, certainly harbored feelings of deep pain and resentment towards the second type of pro-Japanese faction, the hypocritical ones. However, in recent years, the sincere efforts of the first type of pro-Japanese faction in seeking the well-being of the nation have gradually penetrated the hearts of the people. As long as they are not stubbornly prejudiced, everyone is beginning to understand and develop goodwill towards the first type of pro-Japanese faction. However, at the same time, we must recognize the complexity of Chinese social strata. Therefore, although participating in the ranks of the first type of pro-Japanese faction, holding the same goal of revolutionary national salvation and the belief in cooperating with Japan to strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, each person's understanding and the steps they take may not be entirely consistent. Furthermore, the machinations of the second type of pseudo-pro-Japanese faction result in encountering some obstacles or causing unnecessary misunderstandings in all aspects of internal and external policies. For the sake of China's future, for the sake of East Asia's future, we deeply feel that every truly pro-Japanese individual must more accurately recognize the importance of their position in the current era and the arduousness of the responsibilities they bear towards their motherland and towards East Asia, and become more serious and proactive. We firmly believe that the following matters are worthy of deep consideration by every truly pro-Japanese individual, and should be pursued to achieve their realization.

From the perspective of the pro-Japanese faction itself, it is necessary to correct the perceptions of the Chinese people towards the pro-Japanese faction and to establish one's own credibility more firmly and broadly. This is the foundation for safeguarding all current internal and external policies. In order to achieve this, we believe that the steps that should be taken immediately include at least the following three points: First, in a passive sense, it is necessary to separate from the second type of pro-Japanese faction. Government leaders, on the one hand, must be vigilant and self-examine, and on the other hand, should pay attention to whether there are any members of the second type of pro-Japanese faction mixed in with their subordinates, and eliminate them. The success of any sound organization in the world inevitably develops through a difficult and arduous struggle. This struggle is not only external, but also internal. Taking the facts since the current war as an example, the Japanese government structure has been constantly refreshed and improved; and Nazi Germany's reforms of itself are progressing with each passing day. This kind of action is like epidemic prevention. By enduring temporary minor pain, we can prevent the occurrence of intense illness in the future. Second, in an active sense, it is necessary to strengthen ties and consolidate unity among genuine pro-Japanese factions, and to pay more attention to the education and training of cadres. We dare to assert that the soundness of the pro-Japanese faction itself is more effective than any external propaganda, defense, and other work. The final leaning of the people's hearts largely depends on this. This is the first point.

From the perspective of China's situation, the current mission of the first type of pro-Japanese faction, though complex and multifaceted, is simply to accelerate the concentration of national strength to assist Japan in winning the Greater East Asia War, in order to guarantee China's peace, independence, and free development. To accomplish this mission, the basic step is to promote China's comprehensive peace through political struggle. Because the resistance of the Chongqing communists, on the one hand, in the international sense, disrupts the Greater East Asia rear and restrains a portion of the Japanese army, which is a cause for rejoicing for the enemy. Under the responsibility of participating in the war, the pro-Japanese faction should first intensify political efforts to resolve the stubborn resistance of the communists. From the perspective of national interests, the failure to achieve comprehensive peace has led to the inability to carry out national construction, the stagnation of total mobilization, and the standstill of all political, military, economic, and cultural activities. On the other hand, it has dispersed national strength, making it difficult to restore vitality. Therefore, the promotion and implementation of the plans of China, Japan, and East Asia have been affected. Therefore, how to use political means to intensify the struggle to promote comprehensive peace should be the greatest task of the true pro-Japanese faction at present. This is the second point.

From the perspective of East Asian international relations, our country is today one of the three axis powers of East Asia, and also the main rear of the Greater East Asia War. As the world war develops, our country's position will become increasingly important, and our country's responsibilities will become increasingly arduous. As for our country's international relations in East Asia and in the world after the war, this is a question that every patriot must study first. Here, we must pay attention to at least the following points: First, in the past, we have only heard of Japan's China policy, but we have not heard of our country's Japan policy. This is a question worth raising from the standpoint of the people. As the evolution of Sino-Japanese relations and the development of international relations continue in the future, we demand that the government establish a Japan policy. This is also an important task for the pro-Japanese faction at present. Second, in the past, Japan's attitude towards the pro-Japanese factions in China is most worthy of study, and it is hoped that the Japanese side will fully recognize the different locations of the two types of pro-Japanese factions, so that Sino-Japanese relations can move onto the right track. Third, sufficient research and preparation should be made early for post-war Sino-Japanese relations, relations between East Asian countries, repatriation issues, and construction issues. This is what we expect of the true pro-Japanese faction. This is the third point.

We are today in the most serious international situation. Having a good policy outline is not enough for both internal and external affairs. The main thing is to rely on determination and practice. Therefore, the true pro-Japanese faction must, based on their sincere love for China, love for Japan, and love for East Asia, cooperate with Japan to solve the entire East Asian problems that have occurred and may occur, and seek the implementation of the national policies of China and Japan.

### The Russo-Japanese War - Records from This Newspaper Thirty-Eight Years Ago - Old Newspaper New Excerpt (8)

Introduction

We recognize that the responsibility of defending the Pacific in the future will entirely be the responsibility of Asians, and that the intrusion and aggression of British and American forces will no longer be tolerated. However, fulfilling the task of defense depends on strong naval power. Our allied nation, Japan, has built its navy through decades of diligent effort and continuous improvement. In the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, it defeated the many with the few, initially showing its capabilities. In this Greater East Asia War, it has further displayed invincible power. Currently, the entire defense of the Pacific is solely shouldered by the navy of our allied nation, which is a difficult task, and we feel deeply ashamed that we have been unable to share the burden. Therefore, how we will emulate the navy of our allied nation to build a new Chinese navy and participate in the task of defending the Pacific is truly an effort that the people of our country should jointly and urgently pursue. In order to increase the Chinese people's naval knowledge and interest, this newspaper will excerpt and newly copy the records of this newspaper during the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, from the 21st to the 30th, for a period of ten days. We hope that readers will pay attention to it.

### Under the Cooperation of the Navy and Air Force, Determined to Advance on the Path of Overcoming the Enemy — Broadcast by Yano, Chief of the Press Section of the Imperial Headquarters —

Tokyo, 27th, Central News Agency Telegram. Rear Admiral Hideo Yano, Chief of the Press Section of the Imperial Japanese Navy Headquarters, on the occasion of the 38th Japanese Navy Day on the 27th, broadcasted to the entire nation at 7:30 PM via the Tokyo Central Radio Station, with the theme "Celebrating Navy Day Under Decisive Battle." The gist of his speech is as follows: "We celebrate this deeply meaningful Navy Day amidst the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War. What is most unforgettable is the heroic sacrifice of Fleet Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, in April this year on the South Pacific Front, his sincere loyalty to the country, and his courageous spirit to defeat the enemy. The reason why the Japanese Navy under Marshal Togo Heihachiro achieved an unprecedented victory in the Battle of Tsushima was due to the sincere loyalty to the country of Marshal Togo and all the officers and soldiers, and their efforts to fight with the spirit of unanimously destroying the enemy. In the Greater East Asia War, our naval soldiers have been fighting day and night with their traditional spirit, resulting in the heroic sacrifice of Fleet Admiral Yamamoto. The heroic sacrifice of Admiral Yamamoto is sufficient to prove the glorious traditional spirit of our navy of 'commanders leading by example' and 'seeking to kill the enemy.' Looking at the current stage of the world war situation, we deeply feel that this year is a decisive year. Our country is now united with Germany, Italy, and other countries, with the rise and fall of the nation as the priority, exerting all our strength to confront Britain and the United States, repeatedly engaging in fierce battles. Since this spring, the Pacific war situation has seen fierce air battles between the enemy and us day and night. At the same time, on the 12th of this month, the U.S. military, under the cover of waterborne boat units and air force, landed on Attu Island. Currently, our garrison on the island is engaging in fierce battles with a small number of troops. This is because the United States has suffered repeated defeats since the start of the war and is therefore challenging us, seeking to gain a necessary base in the Pacific. The enemy's intention is to gradually advance its bases, expand the scope of its air control, to carry out naval decisive battles under air control, and to try its best to carry out air raids on our mainland. Our navy, in cooperation with the army, has been coordinating in the land, sea, and air, launching fierce attacks, destroying enemy bases, and constantly threatening their communication and transportation lines, achieving remarkable results. Furthermore, the United States is currently attempting to launch air raids on Japan from bases in Chongqing, watching intently for an opportunity to act, actively expanding the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing. At the same time, the U.S. and British forces stationed in India are eager to recapture Burma and reopen the Burma Road, but because of the Japanese army's valiant operations, the British and American forces suffered a complete defeat in the Arakan campaign and ultimately failed to achieve their goal. The United States' target for aircraft production this year is 125,000 aircraft, including army, navy, and air force aircraft, and boasts that it can now produce 7,000 aircraft per month. On the one hand, it is mobilizing students across the country in an attempt to train a large number of flight personnel. As for the state of U.S. warship construction, there are a total of 827 ships and 3.39 million tons of shipbuilding plans, including the Third Vinson Act and the naval construction plans for the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as well as the First and Second shipbuilding plans established after the start of the war, which seem to be in full swing. The above-mentioned active strengthening of air power, sea power, and ships by the United States is intended to overwhelm Japan with several advantages. Japan is also prepared and fearless. If the enemy comes from the air, we will destroy them in the air. If they come from the sea, we will destroy them at sea. Therefore, we are determined to strengthen our air power, sea power, and ships. Various new aircraft, the crystallization of the people's hard work, have successively taken off, and new warships and powerful new vessels have also appeared on the ocean. Our only lesson now is to 'advance,' only to advance with the belief of certain victory. When Admiral Mineichi Koga received the great order to be Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, he declared to all the officers and soldiers under his command his determination to follow Admiral Yamamoto and other heroic spirits in heaven, to devote himself to completing the great task of protecting the country. Now the morale of the Combined Fleet is even higher, vowing to unite under the leadership of the new commander-in-chief to thoroughly destroy the enemy, thereby repaying the Emperor's grace. Now, in the autumn of a major war situation, we welcome this glorious Navy Day. Our navy vows to advance towards the path of destroying the enemy together with the entire nation."

### Aircraft Carrier's Active Role

December 8th was a day that changed world history. Before dawn on that day, a large fleet of aircraft carriers advanced eastward, attacking Hawaii, annihilating the elite U.S. Combined Fleet, clearing the tools that harmed the entire Asian people, and illuminating the dawn of building East Asia.

### Warships Defending Greater East Asia

The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere we are building is the world's first treasure, accounting for the world's largest population and possessing the world's freshest culture. With a vast area, it relies entirely on the sea as a barrier, so it cannot do without large warships and a large navy. Fortunately, our East Asia already has Japan's ever-victorious, ever-conquering and great navy, which serves as our Great Wall.

### Suqing Rural Areas Donate Money to Purchase Aircraft; National Government Issues Order Commending

Nanjing, 27th, Central News Agency Telegram. The National Government ordered (May 27th): Upon investigation, all sectors in the Suqing rural areas of Jiangsu Province supported the war effort by donating money to purchase aircraft. Previously, the governor of the province presented a remittance of 388,888.88 yuan and 8 jiao. It has been ordered to be verified and recorded. Now, the delegation representing the donation, led by Li Shiqun as the head, Huang Jingzhai and Yuan Shu as the deputy heads, Shi Xunqian as the general secretary, and Jiang Zhonglin as the deputy general secretary, presented a speech of donation and brought 1.12 million yuan in national currency. The total donation amounts to 1.50888888 million yuan and 8 jiao, requesting the purchase of aircraft, named "Suqing" and "Jiangsu" to assist in air defense. The head and deputy heads of the delegation promoted the grand plan, and the people of the Suqing rural areas of the province contributed their wealth to defend the country, which is truly commendable in loyalty and righteousness and worthy of commendation. This donation will still be transferred by the Executive Yuan to the Ministry of Finance for verification and collection, and will be notified accordingly. This order.

### National Defense Council Resolves to Change the Subei Military Headquarters to Pacification Commissioner's Office; All Counties in Subei Under the Management of the Jiangsu Provincial Government

Nanjing, 27th, Central News Agency Telegram. Yesterday (27th), the 16th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council passed important cases, excerpts of which are as follows: (1) The Chairman submitted for discussion, and the Secretariat presented a case. The Secretariat of the Central Political Committee submitted for inspection, and the Executive Yuan presented a case from the Ministry of Justice, stating that cases under trial in courts at all levels before the implementation of the Special Law on Wartime Housing Leases should be judged in accordance with this law. The case was submitted for review and approval, and the resolution was passed. Unresolved cases will be judged in accordance with this, but will not be retroactive. (2) The Chairman submitted for discussion, proposing to change the Subei Military Headquarters to the Subei Pacification Commissioner's Office, and to return all counties in Subei to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, establishing the First Administrative Inspectorate of Jiangsu Province. The case was submitted for decision, and the resolution was passed. The Director of the Subei Pacification Commissioner's Office will be concurrently appointed by the Military Affairs Commission, and Zhang Beisheng will be appointed as the Chief of Staff of the Subei Pacification Commissioner's Office. The original Chief of Staff, Fu Shuangying, will be given another appointment, and the original Secretary-General, Zhang Mumin, will be dismissed. (3) He Tingliu, a member of the New Life Movement Promotion Association, was dismissed, and Huang Dazhong was specially appointed as a member of the New Life Movement Promotion Association, serving in this capacity due to his qualifications as the Director of the Department of Education. Long Muxun was specially appointed as a member of the New Life Movement Promotion Association.

Nanjing, 27th, Central News Agency Telegram. During the 16th Supreme National Defense Council meeting on the 27th, the Chairman's motion to change the Subei Military Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission to the Pacification Commissioner's Office, and to place the existing counties in Subei under the management of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, establishing the First Administrative Inspectorate, was passed. Political figures believe that this is a measure to separate military and political affairs and to strengthen provincial administration. The ten-odd counties in Subei are rich in products and have simple customs. Before the Incident, they were part of the Jiangsu Provincial Government's administration. After the National Government returned to the capital, given the importance of security in the area, and the fact that the provincial government's administrative power had not yet penetrated this area, the Subei Military Headquarters was established in 1941 to implement military and political administration. After the director of the Subei Military Headquarters, Zang Zhuo, was transferred, the secretary-general and chief of staff were responsible for military and political affairs. Over the past two years, security has been established day by day, and administration has entered the right track. All special circumstances no longer exist. Zhang Beisheng, the First Administrative Inspector of Jiangsu Province, was appointed as the Chief of Staff of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, and the principle of unifying military and political affairs in the Subei region has been realized here. After the Military Headquarters was changed to the Pacification Commissioner's Office, with the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission personally serving as the Director, this point is particularly important from the perspective of national defense and security. After the establishment of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, there are already four offices under the Military Affairs Commission, including Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Kaifeng. The local National Army units and local security matters are naturally under the management of the Pacification Commissioner's Office. At the same time, the number of counties under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province has also increased, which can be regarded as a new contribution to the improvement of local administrative divisions. In addition, Huang Dazhong was specially appointed as a member of the New Life Movement Promotion Association. Huang is currently the Director of the Department of Education of Hubei Province. It is natural for him to serve as a member of the New Life Movement Promotion Association in this capacity. Long Muxun was originally a professor at Central University and is a well-known youth leader.

Nanjing, 27th Telegram. The National Government ordered (May 27, 1943): The Subei Military Headquarters will be abolished immediately. This order. The Subei Pacification Commissioner's Office is established, with the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission concurrently serving as the Director for the time being. This order. All counties in Subei are returned to the jurisdiction of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. An Administrative Inspectorate is established in Taixian County to oversee the administration of all counties in Subei, and is named the First Administrative Inspectorate of Jiangsu Province. This order.

### Ministry of Construction Plans Three-Year Program

Nanjing, 27th, Central News Agency Telegram. The Ministry of Construction has recently formulated a three-year construction plan based on the actual situation, including three major areas: water conservancy, highways, and urban construction: (1) The purpose of the water conservancy aspect is to prevent floods, protect farmland, and increase agricultural production. The larger projects in the planned program include: (1) Opening up the new Subei Canal to facilitate irrigation, benefit, and increase cultivated land by as much as 5 million mu.

Other plans include river repair and defense, improving the Furong dike in Jiangsu Province, repairing all the sluices along the Yangtze River above Jiangyin, and establishing classes to train water conservancy technicians.

### Great Achievements of the Japanese Army in Yichang; Fierce Attacks Also Launched in Southern Hebei

Hankou, 27th, Central News Agency Telegram. The Japanese army and other units in the Yichang area are echoing the Japanese army advancing northward. On the morning of the 24th, they crossed the Yangtze River and fiercely attacked the main force of the 11th, 18th, and Provisional 34th Divisions of the 18th River Defense Army of the Chongqing Army, breaking through their solid positions constructed for several years.

Hankou, 27th, Central News Agency Telegram. The Japanese army completely defeated the main force of the 10th and 29th Army Groups of the Chongqing army in just one week after starting the summer offensive operation. The Chongqing side hurriedly reinforced its forces in the Jinshi and Fengxian areas, but unexpectedly, the Japanese army turned to the south of Yichang and suddenly started an action to respond. The Japanese army, which had already occupied Yuyangguan and was advancing north from Changyang, lined up against the Chongqing army's resistance from the Yichang area at dawn on the 24th, forcibly crossed the Yangtze River, and quickly broke through the key points of Yutaishan (eight kilometers southwest of Yichang) and Luojiaba (ten kilometers southwest of Yichang) on the same day. It is still continuing to pursue. The 30,000 soldiers of the River Defense Army's 11th, 18th, and Provisional 34th Divisions, which the Chongqing side boasted were strong and elite, were in a state of collapse after being fiercely attacked by the Japanese army.

### Promoting the Traditional Spirit

— Colonel Kamata

Yesterday was the 38th Naval Memorial Day in Japan. At a time when the Greater East Asia War is achieving successive victories, its significance is all the more profound. Colonel Kamata, head of the press section of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, delivered a commemorative speech at the Hongkou International Theater at 7:20 p.m. on the 27th. The topic was: "Promoting the Traditional Spirit," and he elaborated in detail on the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy. The content of Colonel Kamata's speech is recorded as follows:

(1) Introduction

Today is the 38th anniversary of the naval battle of the Sea of Japan, when the sacred General Togo led our Combined Fleet to intercept and annihilate the Russian Baltic Fleet on the waters off Tsushima Island, not only creating a turning point for the prosperity of the Empire but also heralding the dawn of Asia.

At that time, the Z-flag, emblazoned with the words "The rise or fall of the Empire depends on this battle; each man must exert himself," was hoisted atop the mast of the flagship Mikasa. Unexpectedly, on December 8th of the year before last, it was hoisted again at Pearl Harbor. Since then, not only our fleet's officers and men but also all 100 million citizens of the Empire and the various ethnic groups of East Asia have forever beheld this Z-flag, proclaiming "The rise or fall of the Empire depends on this battle; each man must exert himself."

The belligerent nations, both sides, agree that these one to two years are the decisive period. But at this juncture, we must recall those days and commemorate the achievements of our predecessors. At the same time, we must strengthen our determination to complete the Greater East Asia War, and further overcome the many difficulties we will encounter in the future to build a glorious Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere without regret. I am truly honored to be able to express my commemorative thoughts today on this memorial day with the theme of "Promoting the Traditional Spirit."

(2) Promoting the Traditional Spirit

Since ancient times, in the East, there has been the saying, "The success of anything is not achieved in a single day." In the West, too, there is the saying, "The success of Rome was not achieved in a day." Every time I read history, I am convinced of the truth of this saying. Our Japan is now the most sublime and unparalleled nation in the world, admired by the people of all nations. However, this is not the result of one morning or evening's effort. Tracing back to the Imperial Rescript on Education bestowed by the Meiji Emperor, it states, "Our Imperial Ancestors founded the nation and established virtue on a grand and far-reaching scale. Our subjects should be loyal and filial, with hundreds of millions of hearts as one, generation after generation, to carry on this beauty. This is the essence of our national polity." He also granted gracious instructions, stating, "In the event of an emergency, you should bravely and publicly support the eternal imperial fortunes of heaven and earth." Therefore, we deeply recognize that the foundation is built upon the virtue of successive emperors and the traditional spirit built by our ancestors with loyalty and filial piety. Furthermore, today, we must engrave upon our hearts the loyalty of 100 million hearts as one, so as to support the eternal imperial fortunes of heaven and earth for all ages and in all places. At this historical turning point, with "Promoting the Traditional Spirit" as the theme, let us together recall the naval battle of the Sea of Japan and explain how the traditional spirit cultivated at that time can be further promoted and amplified in the current Greater East Asia War to provide reference material for everyone to adapt to the current situation.

(3) Lessons from the Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan

The naval battle of the Sea of Japan was an unprecedented great naval battle, and its results were unparalleled. However, this victory is, of course, entirely due to the Emperor's virtue, which goes without saying. It was also the result of the officers and men of the Combined Fleet at that time learning from the Sino-Japanese War and, even earlier, from the lessons of our naval battles, and implementing them. Today, examining the eternally indelible lessons of war for future generations, I believe this is extremely meaningful. First: All the officers and men of the fleet deeply recognized that the rise or fall of the Empire depended on the sea. The sea is our nation's lifeline. To defend our glorious homeland, we must "protect the sea." The aforementioned point was emphasized by Admiral Togo when he disbanded the Combined Fleet. In his instructions to his subordinates, he stated at the outset, "We must be aware of permanently maintaining the gains after the war and further supporting the prosperity of the national fortune. Regardless of peacetime or wartime, we should take the lead in standing on the outer boundary, and the military should always maintain its strength at sea to respond to any emergency." This kind of awareness is the belief held by all naval officers and men today, and this belief must be maintained forever. Second: The spirit of resolute annihilation. When the Combined Fleet departed from Chinkai, Admiral Togo telegraphed the headquarters, stating in the first telegram: "Having received the alarm that the enemy fleet has been sighted, the Combined Fleet is immediately departing, determined to annihilate it. Today's weather is clear, but the waves are extremely high." From this, we can see the spirit of annihilating the enemy leaping from the paper. Only with this spirit of annihilation can we achieve victory in every battle. The spirit of annihilation and the belief in certain victory, although different in words, are the same in meaning. Our 100 million citizens, no matter what difficulties they encounter, must not allow this belief to waver in the slightest, then victory can be assured. Furthermore, with this belief, we will have the determination to die on the battlefield. The following two examples are the main reasons for the decisive victory in the naval battle of the Sea of Japan, and they are the most striking examples of the spirit of annihilation being brought into full play. (1) At 2:05 p.m., when 8,000 meters from the enemy, Admiral Togo suddenly and bravely decided to steer from a south-southwesterly course to a northeast-easterly course, turning about 160 degrees. (2) In the midst of enemy bullets raining down, he waited patiently without moving. Once the opportunity matured, he unleashed a barrage of fire. This kind of turning in front of the enemy was even considered the worst tactic during exercises. The enemy rejoiced, "Togo has made a mistake; we have won." Seeing the position of our ships, the enemy momentarily paused. At about 2:07 p.m., white smoke appeared on the enemy flagship "Suvorov," and at the same time, all the enemy ships fired simultaneously, with fierce gunfire. Near the Mikasa, which was standing on the front line, giant shells rained down, and the shadows of the ships were obscured by the shells and water spray. At this time, the Admiral still did not order to fire until about 2:11 p.m., at a distance of 6,400 meters, when he finally ordered "Begin firing."

In the four or five minutes between the enemy's firing and our firing, more than 300 enemy shells flew in, causing the flagship Mikasa to suffer slight damage before firing a single shot. However, the ship bravely endured. Our fleet's formation blocked the enemy fleet, concentrating fierce gunfire on the two foremost enemy ships, successfully forming a T-shape. The gunfire of our ships, trained fiercely on a daily basis, now demonstrated its effectiveness. In the following 30 minutes, the outcome of the naval battle was decided. Therefore, it can be said that the rise or fall, safety or danger, of the Empire depended on these 30 minutes. (3) Admiral Togo's attitude when the enemy ships surrendered. The Russian fleet, composed of eight battleships, nine cruisers, three coastal defense ships, nine destroyers, one auxiliary cruiser, six auxiliary ships, and two hospital ships, totaling 38 ships with a total displacement of 211,120 tons, was engaged in fierce fighting for two days and one night. We sank 19 of them, and the rest scattered and fled, or scuttled themselves. Many of the rest were detained by neutral countries and disarmed. Only one small cruiser, two destroyers, and one auxiliary ship escaped safely. Enemy Commander Rear Admiral Nebogatov led two battleships and two naval ships and, after enduring hardship, finally escaped to the vicinity of Ulleungdo Island on the morning of the 28th. However, they were still surrounded and shelled by our main fleet at that location, and finally lowered their naval ensign to indicate surrender. At this time, a staff officer on the bridge of the Mikasa, seeing this scene, exclaimed, "Admiral, the enemy has raised the flag of surrender. Please order to cease fire." However, the Admiral still did not issue the order to "cease fire." He said to the staff officer, "Although they have raised the white flag, the enemy ships are still accelerating, and their gun muzzles are aimed at our side. It is too early to cease fire." He continued to fire until he saw the enemy ships stop moving, and then he ordered to cease fire. If it is said that Admiral Togo was a cold and ruthless admiral, the fact is certainly not so. Admiral Togo was truly a marshal who grasped the essence of the spirit of annihilation, which is "not to rest until the enemy is annihilated." In the past history, we have repeatedly seen people who failed at the last hurdle. However, the nature of the Greater East Asia War is completely different. Our 100 million citizens of the Empire should thoroughly implement this spirit of annihilation and certain victory. As Marshal Yamamoto said, "If the United States does not make a vow of surrender in the White House, then we will never stop fighting."

(4) The Greater East Asia War and the Imperial Navy

The Z-flag that was last hoisted in the Russo-Japanese War was used at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War in the magnificent surprise attack operation on Pearl Harbor. This Z-flag not only indicates that the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor is where the rise or fall of the Empire lies, but also that this war is a decisive and protracted war. During the duration of the Greater East Asia War, this Z-flag is truly an order that inspires and encourages our naval officers and men. Furthermore, our 100 million citizens, no matter what their occupation or what moment they are in, all deeply recognize their occupation. At that moment, everything is related to the rise or fall of the Empire. At that time, following the instructions of our ancestors, we poured all our strength into serving the public good and striving forward. Our naval officers and men always have a firm determination to establish merits even more excellent than those of our ancestors. We also hope to show future generations a model of glorious tradition and support the boundless imperial fortunes. The valiant attacks of the First and Second Special Attack Units in the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor saw 60,000 rounds fired per minute, and torpedoes were used to sink the battleship "Prince of Wales," which was boasted as unsinkable, and the "Repulse." The fierce attack by the air force at the Battle of Malaya (December 10th) demonstrated the wonders of modern three-dimensional warfare. The surprise attack operation by the paratroopers at Menado (January 17th), the shelling by submarines far off the coast of California in the United States mainland (February 24th), the fierce attack at Midway (June 5th), the night attack at the Solomon Islands (August 14th), and the assault tactics in other air battles are all manifestations of the spirit of annihilation. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, within a short period of time, the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States, which were entrenched in the Pacific Ocean, were completely annihilated and eliminated. Their ambitions to cut off the Greater East Asia and oppress Japan were thwarted, and our country was able to freely roam the Pacific Ocean. From this, prosperity and growth have developed. As mentioned above, the Greater East Asia War, since the Pearl Harbor surprise attack, has undergone a series of operations such as surprise attacks, strong attacks, and assaults. However, the reason it has such a character is due to the promotion of the traditional soul of our military. The reason this traditional soul is produced is because it is the essence of our national polity, and because our navy often has to fight in an environment where it is outnumbered in naval battles. If we adopt a tactful strategy when outnumbered, it is difficult to win. However, merely adopting a suicidal strategy is not necessarily a victory. In modern warfare, which brings the full power of modern science into play, a blind kamikaze attack cannot succeed. This kind of kamikaze strategy must also be rationally planned and repeatedly trained. First, firmly believe that it will succeed, and then move forward. Admiral Togo said in his farewell address at the disbandment of the Combined Fleet, "God always grants victory to the army that is diligently trained and wins before the battle." The slogan solicited by the local naval association branch before this memorial day was "5-5-3 Monthly Gold Kamikaze Attack." Among them, 5-5-3 represents the ratio of the Japanese Navy to the British and American navies. Monthly Gold represents recalling the humiliating Washington and London treaties. With enmity and hatred, we engage in constant training every week, trusting in the divine skills we have acquired, plus a kamikaze attack. The glorious war achievements of our navy were created from this.

### Assuming Mediterranean Defense The Axis Air Force Is Formidable 370 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down This Month British and American Warships Congregate at Gibraltar

Rome, 27th (Central News Agency) - A special correspondent for the Maritime News Agency, Hoham Baek, quoted Italian sources as saying that the results of the air battles over the Mediterranean Sea and Italian airspace were quite satisfactory. The Axis air force continued its determination in the Tunisian War and gained greater operational independence and freedom in its new defense mission. The Axis air force no longer had to engage in the difficult task of aerial and maritime escort and enjoyed greater freedom, and had adapted its tactics to defense. Currently, bomber squadrons are used exclusively to attack enemy seaports in North Africa, while fighter squadrons are used exclusively to intercept enemy aircraft attacking Italian cities.

Rome, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Italian military headquarters announced on the 26th: The Axis air force's achievements in the Mediterranean waters are as follows: (1) In May, the Axis air force and anti-aircraft guns shot down 370 enemy aircraft, most of which were four-engine bombers, so the anti-Axis air force lost at least 1,800 pilots or more. (2) In the recent two-day air battle over Sicily and the islands of Pantelleria, the anti-Axis air force lost 74 aircraft.

Rome, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Italian military headquarters announced on the 26th: (1) The Italian naval torpedo squadron attacked an anti-Axis convoy on the Algerian sea, sinking two merchant ships and severely damaging many others. (2) The Axis air force bombed the port of Bizerte. (3) The anti-Axis air force bombed the city of Messina on Sicily on the 25th, causing heavy damage to the city center. (4) The Axis air force and anti-aircraft guns shot down 44 enemy aircraft on the 25th.

Rome, 27th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: When Italian aircraft raided the port of Bonne on May 24th afternoon, they caused considerable damage, and many enemy soldiers were injured and killed.

Algeciras, 27th (Central News Agency) - Spanish observers yesterday saw a large anti-Axis convoy pass through the Strait of Gibraltar, heading towards the Mediterranean. Among them were ships fully loaded with troops and military equipment, one of which was the 50,000-ton mail ship of the Cunard Line. The Gibraltar naval port currently has three British aircraft carriers, three battleships, twelve destroyers, eight gunboats, two American gunboats, and two British submarines. In addition, there is one American transport ship, one French transport ship, and three British transport ships.

### Veriki Luki Front German and Soviet Troops Engaged in Confused Fighting German Troops Improve Positions in Kupensk District

Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Central News Agency) - Since the German and Soviet armies launched a major tank battle in the southwestern area of Veriki Luki on the central front of the Eastern Front on the morning of the 25th, it seems that they have completely fallen into a state of confused fighting. According to the German News Agency, the German army, unable to withstand the pressure of the numerically superior Soviet army, once retreated to new positions. After the arrival of reinforcements, they launched a fierce counterattack again on the night of the 25th. The Soviet army suffered heavy losses and retreated, and the three lost areas were completely recaptured. Furthermore, the German army north of Dmitrovsk in the Kupensk area launched a fierce attack on the 26th and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the Soviet army. After a long period of fierce fighting, 400 Soviet troops were killed, and they were completely defeated. In this battle, the German army captured 600 Soviet troops, as well as two 7.62 mm artillery positions and a large number of automatic rifles and mortars, and the positions were also improved.

### Northern Front Operations Are Extremely Difficult

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: German military figures emphasized the importance of the German front line in Leningrad and the Soviet military objectives. They said that since winter, the German trapezoidal positions on the Eastern Front had repeatedly caused the Soviet attempts to fail. The current goal of the Soviet army is obviously to lift the threat to Leningrad, but in reality, the scope of their plan is much broader. The Soviet side wants to break through the German front line between Volkhov and Peipus, so that it can enter Estonia, reopen the Gulf of Finland, cut off the connection between the Finnish and Norwegian fronts and the German army on the Eastern Front, and establish contact with the United Kingdom through Scandinavia. When the battle near Lake Ladoga on March 25th came to an end, the German army in the area once again defeated all Soviet attempts. The only gain for the Soviet army was a small piece of land as a point of contact with Leningrad, but the price paid was extremely high. Now that all supplies can be transported to Leningrad via Lake Ladoga, this small corridor is of little use. During the Lake Ladoga battle, the German army had to fight simultaneously on the two northeastern fronts. As a result, the Soviet side suffered a total of one million soldiers killed and wounded and lost a large number of military supplies. In order to maintain this front line, the German army fought in extremely difficult circumstances, because the area is densely forested, has many swamps, and is infested with mosquitoes and flies. The German army had to put down their weapons at any time and use axes and hoes to open roads. The German army was assisted in the battle by the Spanish Volunteer Division and volunteers from Estonia, Latvia, and the Netherlands. It should be known that the victory or defeat of this battle cannot be decided by the gains or losses of one place, but by continuously annihilating the enemy until they are completely exhausted.

### Famous German Air Force General Killed in Plane Crash

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - The German military headquarters announced yesterday that German Air Force General Waldau was killed in a plane crash while inspecting the defense zone.

### Luo-Qiu Talks Have Now Reached the Final Stage Stalin Receives Davies Again

Amsterdam, 27th (Central News Agency) - According to Washington sources: The Luo-Qiu conference has reached the final stage and continued to be discussed on Wednesday morning.

Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from Swedish journalists in London, people in London are impatiently awaiting the final communique of the Luo-Qiu Washington conference and are speculating about whether this communique will be the beginning of an anti-Axis offensive. According to a reporter from the Swedish News, the communique will only be released after British Prime Minister Churchill returns to London, which suggests that Churchill may already be on his way home.

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: Political circles in Berlin declared that Churchill's remarks to the Washington press were sufficient to show that he was doing his best to cater to the American public. The United Kingdom and the United States have always considered the European theater as the most important, and have considered the Pacific front as less important. The United States has recently begun to oppose this, which is an obvious fact. Therefore, Churchill had to reiterate the equality of the European front and the Pacific front in order to appease American public opinion. American public opinion is horrified by the command of the war and has criticized the attitude adopted by the British government.

Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency) - According to Moscow Radio: Stalin met again yesterday with U.S. President's Special Envoy Davies, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov was also present. The details of the matters discussed are unknown.

### Important Personnel Changes

Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency) - There have been important changes in the personnel of the British Ministry of Production recently. Sir Layton, the chief planning advisor of the ministry, will resign at the end of this month, and will also resign from his concurrent position as the leader of the Joint Wartime Production Office. The vacant position will be succeeded by Sir Sinclair, the production department official and British representative of the Joint Production Resources Committee in Washington. The vacant official position will be filled by Sir Selpho, the permanent secretary of the ministry. Layton's resignation has attracted general attention in London, because he has served since the ministry was founded. Layton is also a director of the London Chronicle and was the editor of "The Economist" monthly for 17 years.

### Labor Unrest Spreads in the United States

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) - Washington: Labor unrest in the United States is still spreading, and several factories have recently gone on strike. 50,000 workers in the three major rubber factories in Akron and Barberton have gone on strike to protest the decision of the Wartime Labor Board and have ignored the War Department's request to resume work, so rubber production has come to a standstill. Furthermore, transportation workers in Akron went on strike due to participation in a labor conference, making traffic in the city more difficult. 12,000 workers at the Connor Wheel Factory expressed dissatisfaction with the factory's promotion of several female workers and went on strike. In addition, thousands of workers in the states of Cleveland, Ohio, and Wisconsin have also gone on strike. Public transport workers in Utica, New York, have also gone on strike, and almost all city traffic has been disrupted.

### Promoting Traditional Spirit

— Colonel Kamata

(Continued from Second Edition)

We often experience these teachings, whether it be the production war that is currently causing a great stir, or the trivial daily tasks, we must apply rational, thorough, and meticulous planning, repeated training, and when implementing it, show a spirit of bold and courageous breakthrough, then we firmly believe that everything will surely be accomplished. The valuable lessons learned from the actual combat experience must be fully savored and not ignored.

(5) Marshal Yamamoto's Death in Battle

At 2:00 PM on May 21st, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced that Admiral Yamamoto, commander of the Combined Fleet, died valiantly in action on his plane in the foremost southern battle line. We soldiers, of course, and even the hundred million citizens, are overcome with grief and find it hard to express.

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, General Yamamoto, under a grand and unparalleled plan, commanded the Combined Fleet and directed operations. For the past year and a half, with the blessing of the Emperor and close cooperation with the Army, he established an invincible posture and built great achievements that will never fade throughout the ages. This is something deeply known by people at home and abroad and needs no further elaboration.

Our naval officers and men will continue Admiral Yamamoto's legacy, fight with common hatred against the enemy, and further unite in their determination to annihilate the British and Americans, in order to reassure the Emperor. This point has been clarified by Navy Minister Shimada in his statement. The traditional spirit of the Iron Wall-like Imperial Navy will not be shaken in the slightest.

The heroic spirit of Marshal Yamamoto further enhances the glory of our navy. Until the British and Americans are defeated, this kind of self-sacrificing warfare will never cease. Moreover, General Koga, who is deeply familiar with the local conditions, has already, with firm determination and far-reaching plans, taken on the responsibility of commanding the front lines, following the footsteps of the deceased Marshal.

Next, I will briefly elaborate on the heavy responsibilities borne by the commander of the Combined Fleet:

There are many types of ships and aircraft participating in the operation. Ships include battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and submarines, each with different capabilities. Aircraft also have fighters, bombers, reconnaissance planes, and attack planes, each with different capabilities. To concentrate on targets and use the capabilities of these different weapons to destroy the enemy, a very careful plan and skillful application are necessary when using them. However, regardless of aircraft or ships, if their great mobility is commanded and each is launched separately, it is difficult to seize the appropriate opportunity overnight. Therefore, these matters are entirely under the control of the fleet commander. The order to commence shelling also comes from the fleet commander. Therefore, the fleet commander is always present to command. For example, when planning the Battle of Tsushima, Admiral Togo stood on the bridge of the Mikasa, the flagship at the forefront of the fleet, holding his military sword in his left hand, watching the movements of the enemy fleet. When the movement of the fleet could not be clearly seen by the eye, he could rely on advanced communication methods. As for seizing the opportune moment, in today's world where speed and power are greatly increased, it truly depends on a matter of moments. As for ordering action based on the suggestions of staff officers, this would not be done.

As mentioned above, during the Battle of Tsushima, when issuing the order to make a 160-degree turn in front of the enemy, Admiral Togo only moved his left hand. From this, it can be seen that seizing the opportune moment is determined in an instant.

When I was a lieutenant, I heard that a certain admiral had been internally designated as the commander of the Combined Fleet, but he immediately resigned. The reason was that his eyesight was not good, and he could not serve as an admiral at sea. Because a naval commander must be able to judge the movements of distant enemy ships in an instant and cannot manipulate the fleet based on the suggestions of staff officers. Because he lacked confidence, he submitted his resignation. The magnitude of the responsibility of a fleet commander is imaginable. Vice Admiral Akiyama (chief staff officer of the fleet during the Battle of Tsushima) once commented on the sea battle: The reason for the victory in the Battle of Tsushima was entirely due to the Emperor's majesty, but the coordinated actions of all the fleets participating were indeed very natural. This battle was not about fame or fortune, nor was it a battle for personal valor. Everyone contributed their courage, and everyone demonstrated their intelligence. The sea battle was truly a "coordinated action." Everyone fully utilized all their skills and talents, and coordinated operations were carried out without a single error, and thus a great victory was achieved.

The one who leads this kind of coordinated action as if it were the action of one person is the fleet commander. The reason why only the name of the commander of the Combined Fleet was announced in this war is also for this reason. Now, I will give another example regarding seizing the opportune moment to strike. During the Russo-Japanese War, 203 Meter Hill in Port Arthur was occupied by our forces on December 1, 1904. Our naval guns and army howitzers used the height to sink the entire enemy fleet in the harbor, leaving only one ship. This warship was the battleship "Sevastopol." The ship fled outside the harbor, laid mines, and anchored with its back to the mountain, far away from the Japanese ships. At that time, it was heard that Rozhestvensky's fleet had departed from Russia and was sailing towards the East, while the Combined Fleet had to return home to enter the dock to clean or repair the bottom of the ships. However, because there was still one battleship anchored outside Port Arthur, it was difficult to return. Therefore, torpedo boats made several desperate attacks on the "Sevastopol." The torpedo boat attacks were carried out at night. The captain reported that he had heard the sound of a torpedo hitting or exploding, but during the day the ship was still anchored in place. It was difficult to determine whether it had been sunk, run aground, or hit by a torpedo. If it was not confirmed, it could not return. In order to make sure it was confirmed, Admiral Togo personally observed it. He went to the Dragon King Pond watchtower on the Tatsuta and personally observed it with a telescope. He confirmed that it had been sunk and decided to sail the fleet back to Japan. Admiral Togo was the most trusted subordinate officer, but when deciding on the most important events, he always made the decision with his own responsibility.

Speaking of today: The so-called spirit of the front lines has become the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy since Admiral Togo. From the spirit of Admiral Yamamoto, who died valiantly in combat on his plane while directing overall operations on the South Pacific front, it can be seen that the actions of Japanese naval fleet commanders are all of a piece. We are truly receiving endless teachings.

(6) Conclusion

Whenever we celebrate this glorious Navy Day, we often recall and savor the teachings of the fallen heroes. We must redouble our efforts in our service positions. All one hundred million of our citizens must also keep this in mind. In the current decisive battle period, we must use the total power of one hundred million hearts and minds to engage in production, and further improve the current shape of certain victory and invincibility. We cannot say it is enough unless we defeat the British and Americans.

### Yesterday Was Japanese Navy Day Held Grand Celebrations Raised Warship Flags and Solicited National Defense Donations Banquet Celebrated Merits and Held Public Assembly

Yesterday was the actual day of the Japanese Navy Memorial Day, and Japanese officials and civilians in this city held grand celebrations. Thirty-eight years ago, Japan used its newly created navy to annihilate the powerful Imperial Russian fleet in one fell swoop. The date was May 27, 1905. Since then, celebrations have been held on this day every year. This year is the 38th anniversary, and the second time to commemorate Navy Day since the start of the East Asia War. Now that good news is frequently reported, the entire nation of Japan is filled with joy beyond measure, and the naval authorities and tens of thousands of expatriates in Shanghai are especially excited. The commemorative program began on the 21st. The situation yesterday was even more enthusiastic. There are still commemorative programs for the next two days.

Raising Warship Flags and Soliciting National Defense Donations

Yesterday morning at 7:30, Japanese expatriates, under the guidance of naval officials, gathered at the Shanghai Shrine to hold a raising ceremony for the warship flag and the Z flag. The Z flag was used by Commander Togo during the Battle of Tsushima to encourage his subordinates, indicating that the rise and fall of the Japanese Empire depended on this battle. The flag was raised high to boost morale. After the raising ceremony, members of the Japanese Women's Patriotic Society began to solicit donations on various important streets. The workers all wore white belts on their chests with the fundraising mark of the Patriotic Women's Society written on them. Donors were very enthusiastic, and all proceeds were used as national defense donations.

Opening Celebration Banquet and Holding Conference

In addition, 1,500 fifth-grade students from various Japanese national schools in this city went to the Izumo warship to observe the lives of naval soldiers. From 6:30 PM, the Total Strength Patriotic Association held a naval celebration banquet at the Ponglu Japanese Club. At 7:00 PM, a military music, speech, and film conference was held at the Hongkou International Theater, attended by 2,000 people. The speaker was Colonel Ide, director of the Fleet Press (the full text of the speech is on pages 2 and 3). The Fleet Military Band performed on the scene, and the films included "Japanese News," "Shanghai Marine Corps," and "Naval War Chronicles," which were screened simultaneously with the Imperial City of Kyoto.

Shanghai Radio Broadcast Program

To celebrate Japanese Navy Day, Shanghai Radio broadcast a special music program from 9:10 PM to 9:30 PM last night (27th). The program featured performances of the accordion and harmonica by Shi Renwang and Shi Hailun. The detailed program included "Defending the Pacific," "Destruction of the British East Indies Fleet," "March of the Sea," "Pacific March," "Great Battle of Hawaii," "Warship March," and "Victory Song of Korea." It is learned that Fleet Press Director Colonel Kamata will be invited to give a speech from 10:10 PM to 10:40 PM tonight.

Boat Race and Armed Relay Race Tomorrow and the Day After

The commemorative activities for Navy Day will end on the evening of the 30th. Starting tomorrow, the First and Second Girls' High Schools and female commercial students will visit and serve at the Naval Hospital. The day after tomorrow is the last day of the commemorative festival, which is also the anniversary of Admiral Togo's death. From 9:30 AM, a ceremony will be held on the deck of the Izumo warship to mark the first anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai branch of the Naval Boy Scouts. After the ceremony, the group will march from the Izumo warship to the Shanghai Shrine. From 1:30 PM in the afternoon, the Yoshida Commander's Cup short boat race will be held on the Suzhou River, with participating groups including the Japan Submarine Club, Ocean Student Corps, Aquatic Baojia, and Customs and Port Authority. From 1:00 PM in the afternoon, an armed relay race will be held, starting from the Izumo warship to the Eight Pillars Garden Loyalty Tower. The winner will receive the victory flag presented by Commander Yoshida, and there will be a grand occasion at that time.

### Key Points of General Yoshida's Speech

Admiral Yoshida, commander of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, attended the banquet held by the Japan Total Strength Patriotic Association at the Japanese Club at 6:30 PM yesterday, the 38th Navy Day, and gave a speech, recalling the great victory of the Battle of Tsushima and expressing the nation's determination in the Great East Asia Decisive Battle, and the firm resolve of the fleet stationed in China. This was the first public speech given by Admiral Yoshida since taking office, and it gave everyone an extraordinary feeling. The main points of the speech are recorded as follows: The great victory in the Battle of Tsushima determined the overall situation of the Russo-Japanese War and was a major reason why the Empire has its prosperity today. There is no need to elaborate further. Over the past 38 years, as the Empire's national fortune has flourished, the jealousy and oppression of other countries have become increasingly severe. Looking back on the difficult history of resisting the oppression of other countries at that time, and now being in the midst of a war to punish Britain and the United States in the vast theater of the Greater East Asia region, I am truly filled with emotion. Commander Togo often gave instructions at the time of the dissolution of the Combined Fleet after the Russo-Japanese War, saying, "If we always follow the Emperor's words, diligently strive, and accumulate strength to await the opportunity, then we can almost complete the great task of protecting the country forever." Afterwards, the Japanese Navy inherited the legacy of its predecessors, diligently trained in tactics, strengthened its military preparations, and secretly accumulated strength. When the Emperor's Edict was issued the year before last, the opportunity came, and under the Emperor's authority, it closely cooperated with the Army in combat to fully complete the heavy responsibility of protecting the country. In addition to this great victory, we must not forget the painstaking efforts of the predecessors who led to the victory in the Russo-Japanese War. Among the guests participating in today's banquet, there are many who wear Russo-Japanese War medals, and I express my infinite respect to them. Today, when one hundred million citizens are striving to complete the Great East Asia War, it is an event filled with emotion to once again encounter this deeply meaningful Navy Day. Our people must deeply remember that this war is truly a battle to determine the rise and fall of our country and the rise of East Asia. You are all soldiers in the rear, and you must use the determination of the fleet generals and soldiers who fought at 1:55 PM on this day 38 years ago after the declaration of war was issued, to work even harder and strive to destroy the enemy before it is over. As the responsibility of the Imperial Navy becomes increasingly heavy today, we must also unite from top to bottom, respond to the Emperor's will, and meet the expectations of the hundred million citizens. The other day, Admiral Yamamoto, commander of the Combined Fleet, died valiantly at the front, and all of us in the Navy are filled with sorrow. However, the morale of the front-line soldiers has therefore increased, and under the leadership of the brilliant new commander, Koga, we will continue to fight fiercely.

### The Case of a Female Teacher Being Insulted to Death is Scheduled to Be Tried The Municipal Education Association Sends Personnel to Express Condolences Coffin Expenses Are Not Yet Settled and Assistance Is Needed

The case of Su Yizhi, a female teacher at the Sacred Heart Elementary School on Pingliang Road, who was beaten and insulted to death by Liu Wangshi, a family member of a student, is in the custody of the autopsy office on Hart Road. The forensic doctor examined the body at 11:00 AM yesterday. The forensic doctor had not yet tested which poison she had taken, so he specially took out the deceased's internal organs for research. The family has moved the body to the Xijin Guild Hall on Haining Road. According to the family, the coffin was borrowed from a coffin shop near the school, and the coffin expenses have not yet been settled. The case is scheduled to be heard in court on June 2.

Zhou Hualian Publicly Issued a Statement

Zhou Hualian, Secretary-General of the Municipal Education Association, issued a statement: It is regrettable that this case occurred. In this extraordinary period, teachers in this city are enduring hunger and cold to serve education, and their situation is already extremely pitiful. Unexpectedly, Teacher Su was unexpectedly beaten and insulted while performing her duties, and her situation was even more embarrassing. She was forced by the environment to commit this negative act of suicide, and its stimulation to the education community is even greater. It is hoped that as a result of this case, the school authorities and students' parents will cooperate more closely, so that family education and school education can quickly become one. Schools should give timely guidance to students' personality, behavior, and homework, so that they can correct themselves automatically, and parents should especially understand the school's painstaking efforts in cultivating talents and pay respect to the hard work of teachers. In this way, the style of "respecting teachers and valuing morality" can be seen again in today's society, and similar incidents will not happen again. In addition, the association specially sent Section Chief Chen to visit the family yesterday. The Shanghai Special City Women's Association also expressed its sympathy and is making a righteous appeal to all parties.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Line Fares Will Be Adjusted Next Month It Is Forbidden to Sell Ship Tickets at Inflated Prices Wansheng Operated by Wanji

Due to the disparity in prices between Shanghai and Ningbo, the single-gang merchants on the Shanghai-Ningbo route are quite active. Although there are four ships, Xinning Shao, Changshan, Wansheng, and Hualin, traveling back and forth, it is still difficult to purchase ship tickets for those who need to return to their hometowns for business. In view of this, the authorities have specially adjusted the Shanghai-Ningbo ship fares and strictly prohibit selling them at inflated prices. At the same time, the passenger ticket offices are ordered to strictly prevent the activities of "ticket scalpers." The newly revised fares that will be implemented from June 1 are recorded as follows: The Xinning Shao ship has a total of four types of cabins: (First Class) 189 yuan, (Second Class) 116.5 yuan, (Third Class) 72 yuan, (Fourth Class) that is, the steerage cabin, 33.5 yuan.

Its cabins are (Special Class) 29 yuan in military tickets, (First Class) 21 yuan in military tickets, (Second Class) 17 yuan in military tickets, (Third Class) 13 yuan in military tickets, and (Fourth Class) 6 yuan. The fare of the Wanlin ship is the same as that of the Wanji, but the Hualin also goes to Wanshi Pu, and its Wanshi Pu fare will remain the same for the time being. Future changes have not yet been decided. (The above fares do not include meal money.)

### The Sealing of the Xinzha District the Day Before Yesterday Was Found to Be a False Report A Scavenger Was Peddling Scrap Copper The Tongxi Co.'s Iron Strike Caused an Explosion

At 5:10 PM the day before yesterday, a loud noise suddenly occurred in front of No. 201 Pike Road and Avenue Haig, the Zhicheng Copper and Tin Co., and thick smoke filled the air in an instant. After being reported by Huabao No. 764 nearby to the Xinzha Police Station, a large number of Chinese and Japanese detectives, including Chinese Detective Yang Peisheng, rushed to investigate and learned that the exploding object was actually a circular sulfur bomb. According to Xu Hanqing, a Shaoxing native and employee of the Zhicheng Copper and Tin Co., and his cousin, Xu Hanxiang, a man wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants, carrying an umbrella and a rice container, approached them to sell the copper object. When they refused, he took a pair of scissors, cut the copper object open, threw it in front of the door, and fled, and the copper object exploded immediately. The detectives, based on their confessions, believed that someone had thrown an explosive, which was a serious matter. They reported it to the Japanese Gendarmerie on Mei Baige Road, which sounded the alarm and dispatched all the members of the Baojia team to seal off the Xinzha District and conduct a strict search for the fugitive. At the same time, they put out the fire and detained the Xu brothers at the police station for investigation. It was not until 7:00 PM that the Xus truthfully confessed: the bomb was brought to them by a scavenger at 9:00 AM that morning, and they bought it for two yuan and placed it in a bucket. At 5:00 PM in the afternoon, they didn't know what it was, so they hit it with an iron tool, and it exploded. The detectives, realizing that the facts were clear, lifted the blockade. However, because Xu Hanqing and others should not have made false statements to the police, causing many people to be dispatched and thousands of people to be subjected to a two-hour blockade, their behavior was hateful, and they were ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court, and the police charged them with false accusation and requested severe punishment. The two defendants stammered in their statements, and the court ordered them to be held in custody and set a date for sentencing on June 3.

Economic Review

### The Essentials of Factory Management

Recently, many business enterprises have felt the need for a shift in their operations. The only guideline is to promote the development of production. Operating factories is the only way to promote production. There are five essential factors for factory management:

(1) Industrial products that meet the daily needs of the people.

(2) Raw materials are easily accessible and can be supplied as much as possible from the interior.

(3) Utilizing the existing foundation and operating it rationally.

(4) The scale should not be too large, only aiming for substantial content.

(5) Political and technical experts should be hired, valuing quality over quantity.

At the same time, the financial sector should provide as much sincere and practical help as possible to entrepreneurs who are genuinely engaged in industry. Future loans should be directed towards industrial development and should assist industries that meet the standards, especially small industries, providing them with various conveniences. The standards are as follows:

(1) Having complete mechanical equipment.

(2) Having excellent engineers or technicians.

(3) Having perfect paperwork and excellent management.

(4) Its products are popular with general users or widely used in various regions.

(5) Having substantial content, and the manager can indeed work hard.

If entrepreneurs and financiers recognize the above guidelines and make such long-term plans in industry, then China's enterprises will have a new look.

### Authorities Review and Finalize Domestic Material Trading Plan

In order to promote the smooth material trading between Central China, South China, North China, and Mongolia and balance demand, the national government authorities have finalized this year's material trading plan for Central China, South China, North China, and Mongolia. The plan has been reviewed and approved by the Material Control Review Committee. The material trading plan between Central China and

South China (Guangdong, Shantou, Xiamen) involves close liaison between the two sides to adjust transportation issues. The South China side should strive to increase the transfer of materials from Central China to adjust the trade deficit. The settlement of exchange rates between Central China and South China should be based on the legal tender standard. Various places in South China should vigorously implement transactions with exchange rates for materials transported to Shanghai. As for Central China's trade with

North China, the trading plan is divided into specific material trading and general material trading. The distinction is that (1) specific materials are essential to ensure the supply of materials for important industries and food policies in the importing area. The exporting area should be responsible for supplying the agreed quantity within the agreed limit. (2) For the trade volume of general materials, only a considerable standard is agreed upon. Sino-Japanese commercial firms may strive to increase the trade volume as much as possible. The material trading products between Central China, North China, South China, and Mongolia are based on the production or needs of each region.

A notice has been sent to all county governments to comply with this.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor,

Having recently read the news in the "Economic World" section of your newspaper stating that "Coal balls are not rising in price," which mentions that manufacturers can earn a net profit of over one hundred yuan per ton, I find it inconsistent with the facts and should be corrected to avoid misunderstandings. Regarding the news of coal ball price increases, our association has not heard of it. It is a rumor without any basis. Therefore, I am writing to inform you and hope you will correct it. Sincerely, Shanghai Special City Coal Ball Industry Association.

### Worthy of Attention - Silkworm Cocoon Loan

— Fei

Silkworm farming is the most important side job for farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The income farmers in these two provinces obtain from silkworm farming accounts for a considerable proportion of their total annual income. Moreover, since the establishment of China's commodity import and export records, silk exports have consistently ranked at the forefront of export commodities. Therefore, no one can deny the importance of silk in China's national economy.

Since the war, silk exports have disappeared, and China's silk industry has fallen into its most decadent state. Due to various practical obstacles, most Chinese silk operators have turned to other industries. The silk industry has almost been forgotten. With the unfolding of new policies from friendly nations towards China and the easing of control measures, a lively atmosphere has suddenly emerged. As far as the author knows, there are not only China Silk Industry Corporation, which publicly invites shares in the newspapers, but there are four or five more corporations engaged in silk farming with considerable capital.

Recently, the news that financial institutions are preparing to lend money to the silk industry to purchase spring cocoons has been reported, which is a welcome phenomenon. The author believes that this is indeed of great significance at present. There are at least the following points:

First, isn't the government currently investigating hoarding to suppress production prices? Aren't financial institutions assisting the government, either by order or voluntarily, in actively contracting currency? Are these recovered currencies to be left in reserve without being used? Undoubtedly, they are considering how to inject these contracted currencies. Silkworm cocoon loan purchase is the most stable place to inject these currencies, not to mention that it greatly benefits the revival of China's silk industry.

Second, the concentration of hot money in cities to buy materials is one reason for the current high prices in Shanghai. Returning hot money from the cities to the countryside is not only about suppressing prices, but the major significance of the reorganization of the entire Chinese national economy and the urgency of the times must be recognized by everyone, not just economic theorists and practitioners! Therefore, loan to purchase spring cocoons is the best opportunity to return hot money from cities to the countryside.

Third, since the government implemented the new economic policy and vigorously investigated hoarding and speculation, investors in the cities have no way out. The only way is to develop in rural areas, which not only solves the distress of investors, but also gives them the beautiful name of reviving the rural economy. Since the war, the source of wool goods has disappeared in the item of clothing in food, clothing, housing, and transportation. The high price of yarn and cloth is almost the same as that of silk fabrics, so everyone is happy to use silk fabrics, which are beautiful, affordable, and have both. Therefore, now is the opportunity for silk fabrics to rise, which is a rare opportunity to revive China's silk industry. For investors to find a way out in this direction is the only way out.

Fourth, since the war, the silk industry in Central China has been almost monopolized by the Central China Silk Company. After the National Government participated in the war and friendly countries changed their policies towards China, there have also been significant reforms in the economic aspect. Chinese silk farmers naturally hope to take this opportunity to restore their original prosperity. But they have no meaning to exclude the Central China Company. On the contrary, Chinese silk farmers want to use the company to jointly revive China's silk industry. It must be known that China's silk industry occupies an important position in China's national capital, and people in this industry are making contributions at their posts, based on the awareness of reviving the Chinese economy.

### Poverty and Meanness

— Wang Jiajie

Poverty and meanness seem to be related; however, there is a clear difference.

Poverty is nothing more than a lack of material and money. In terms of spirit, generous people do not see much of an impact; but narrow-minded people will complain. They think that poverty is shameful. This is wrong. The following two examples are well known:

"Yanzi lived in a humble alley in troubled times, with a basket of food and a gourd of water. Others could not bear his hardship, but Yanzi did not change his joy. Confucius praised him," Mencius Li Lou Chapter.

"...The walls around him were bare, unable to shield him from the wind and sun; his short coat was worn and patched, his basket and gourd were often empty; yet he was content... Qian Lou said, 'I am not saddened by poverty and lowliness, nor do I eagerly seek wealth and status...'" Tao Qian, Biography of Mr. Five Willows.

We can indeed be proud of their spirit of contentment and optimistic attitude. Seeking happiness in poverty, our spirit is pure. We do not have to complain and belittle ourselves, and envy those immoral and wealthy people. Although they have money and material enjoyment, their spirit may not be happy, and may not be the same as a person who seeks happiness in poverty.

Meanness is generally thought to come with poverty. Without money, personality becomes mean; with money, personality becomes noble. This is the prejudice of modern society, which is wrong. Poor people may not be without shame and morality, but so-called rich and noble people may still have hoarding, manipulation, and price gouging activities. (It can be said to be a treacherous conspiracy.) Can it be said that they have morality and shame? I say this is meanness, the shame of the heart. They put on a mask of false purity to criticize truly noble people, which is what they consider to be noble and honorable. Wise people will not find it difficult to distinguish between truth and falsehood.

Therefore, we do not need to complain in poverty, we only need to be content, and seek true happiness in poverty; we do not need to envy other people's comfort, because people with abundant material enjoyment may not be truly happy; as long as our hearts are bright, and there is nothing we have done to wrong others, we can stand tall and be without shame, then we are good citizens. And people who become rich immorally, their spirit is mean, they do not deserve to be good citizens. (Reward for assistance funds)

### Watching "Welcoming Spring Flowers"

— Zong Yue

Made by Man'ei

Director: Yasushi Sasaki

Starring: Li Xianglan

If you want to see Li Xianglan's fashion and listen to Li Xianglan's singing, this movie is sure to satisfy your appetite. Also, if you want to enhance some feelings with your "good friend," or if you have always loved to watch soft movies, this is exactly what you need.

It doesn't matter if you don't understand Japanese, it doesn't matter if you don't "buy" the instructions, it doesn't matter if you don't rent a translation device, because I watched it under these three "no's." When the film speaks Mandarin, you can understand it. When it speaks Japanese, there is a translation next to it, sentence by sentence, without any difficulty. Speaking of the film's content:

(1) Screenwriting: The screenwriter is very clever. Although it cannot escape the story of a love triangle, it is not old-fashioned. "Charming, flirtatious, and passionately interesting," it is truly able to combine both.

(2) Director: Only a few ice skating scenes are a bit messy, but the rest are very delicate.

(3) Actors: Li Xianglan's liveliness, beauty, ice skating, singing, Mandarin, and Japanese are all on full display here. Speaking of acting skills, I love the big guy who plays Murakami Takeo. His slow, unhurried attitude, his smiling and wonderfully evocative words, are truly amusing. I suspect that he was originally an optimist who didn't care about anything. In addition, many supporting roles played by Chinese people are very natural and appropriate, completely without the kind of things that make people feel disgusted in American movies.

(4) Sound: Ordinary, up to standard.

(5) Photography: Not as poetic as "Mother and Son Grass." But clear and beautiful enough to deserve a compliment.

(6) Short Film: The short film is Toho's song and dance film "Butterfly Beauty." The protagonist is Tsukio Yumeji from "New Snow." Overall, it is okay, but the meaning seems a bit cliché, and the music is a bit harsh.

### Anecdotes of the Japanese Navy (4)

— Oshita Udaru

(5) Another World

People in the real world—the navy often calls the ordinary world on land the real world—seem to know that submarines are a very arduous world. And the fact is indeed not easy.

The captain bears the entire responsibility. He does not go to bed during the voyage, at most he naps in the chair inside the command tower. When he dozes off, as long as the ship body has a slight shake, or the object, the air has a sound, he immediately wakes up. His attention never rests. If any one of the crew members makes even the slightest mistake, it will cause irreparable serious consequences, so he dare not slack off for a moment. Even in the long-term, enduring and secret search for the enemy, after seeing the enemy and giving the order to prepare for artillery warfare—surface—all actions of the crew are required to be at the maximum speed possible for humans. When stopping artillery warfare—rapid dive—the deckhands also do not drill into the ship from the hatch. Only turn the hatch down. Then stuffing sticks and other iron objects are thrown at their heads like bullets. In addition, they are trapped in narrowness, heat, busyness, lack of water, lack of air, and lack of sunlight.

But the crew members must be treated with great care, and they must not be made unhappy. That is to say, you cannot get angry, once you get angry, you're done. The crew members must first have great self-esteem. They must have confidence and ambition, and then there will be the happiness of another world that is unknown in the real world.

The first kind of happiness is when the enemy is discovered. When the torpedoes they launch head towards the enemy ship, the entire crew prays sincerely and waits for the result. Then there is a deafening sound of hitting the target, followed by the sound of the enemy ship breaking apart in the sea. There is nothing else to compare to the happiness after hearing these sounds. Everything is forgotten. It is the highest peak of human joy.

The second kind of happiness is that the ship is completely integrated, completely understood, and mutually trusted, forming a family. This is not external packaging, not casually said, hypocrisy. A kind of intimate connection between hearts and hearts that is consistent with the real character. Living and dying together, so there cannot be a single person with an idea of distrust. This natural, not bragging life is as fresh and happy as heaven. It is right to respect the crew's hardship. But in a world where disguise and appearance are regarded as normal, at least spiritually, it is not refreshing.

(6) Nothing to Be Surprised About

A certain worldly writer—a writer with a strong sense of emotion—said to a certain naval officer:

"It's so great! Before the night battle in the Solomon Islands, each ship was training leisurely as usual. I was simply grateful when I heard that..."

"Ah! Is that so?"

The naval officer replied indifferently, not expressing agreement with his gratitude. Therefore, the writer felt very disappointed. Because the navy does not think that kind of training in that kind of situation is particularly great. It is regarded as a common thing, not worth surprising. After the fierce battle, even during the cleaning time, they swept the car without a second thought.

That is, in the Battle of the Sea of Japan, on the day after gaining such a great victory, they resolutely carried out the same training as usual.

### Departure (2)

— Naval Reporting Team Member: Hiroshi Hamamoto

"You must know that Guadalcanal has a particularly complex terrain."

The bald man wiped the residual beer on his cigarette-stained yellow middle finger and drew a sketch of Guadalcanal on the table.

"Our troops reached this place at that time. One day, an intelligence officer from our country came here."

Although the bald man stretched out his finger, he didn't want to point at the map while savoring the beer.

"It was during that time that Ensign Matsukaze left his subordinates and was standing to urinate. As you know, he suddenly saw a very tall man standing in the woods less than ten meters away. That person pointed a pistol at him and asked for a cigarette. The enemy soldier, who seemed to be lacking supplies, told him to raise his hands. Ensign Matsukaze was greatly surprised, and of course, had to stop urinating and wait for what would happen next. But he didn't speak the broken English he usually spoke, and just thought quietly. If he drew his sword, the enemy would of course fire. Fighting a robber would already put him at a disadvantage. Moreover, there might be other enemies around. Thinking of this, he simply finished urinating and even started buttoning up his pants, remaining very calm."

Recently, this has become a well-known martial arts legend in this base. It turned out that this bald reporting team member had been there at the time, and he spread the story when he came back. His colleagues in the dormitory had heard him tell it many times, but everyone had never gotten tired of it, and this time they were listening to him with great interest.

"He calmly took out a cherry box from his pocket, and Ensign Matsukaze handed it to the enemy. The enemy didn't notice his malicious intent and boldly walked over. Ensign Matsukaze's left hand suddenly grabbed the enemy's pistol. Using all his strength to hold it, he swung his right hand and drew his sword. It all happened in the blink of an eye, and the enemy's bright red blood spurted out, and he fell to the ground dead."

"Were you watching the fun from the side?"

A short companion wearing particularly large glasses interjected half-jokingly, but the bald man ignored him and continued:

"The interesting part is the story after that. Not long after, Ensign Matsukaze felt that the place was not good, so he walked away. I forgot to mention giving the enemy a cigarette. If he was killed without giving him a cigarette, that would be a bit of a swindle. He felt very sorry, so he seriously took out a cigarette to give to the dead man to smoke. Everyone thought it was dangerous, so they all advised him not to go, but Ensign Matsukaze was very stubborn and didn't listen at all. So, everyone had no choice but to prepare their weapons and follow him."

The bald man finished speaking in one breath, and then drank the remaining beer in one gulp.

Four Gun Emplacements

After spending a long time completing the business at headquarters, Reserve Ensign Matsukaze ran over, sweating profusely.

Reserve Lieutenant Edo said, "I just heard about your Guadalcanal martial arts story," and now looked at the face of his old friend seriously.

"That story? It's all in the past."

Ensign Matsukaze answered casually and sat beside the bald man.

"Mr. Matsukaze, did you meet Lieutenant Taniyama last night?" This was said by the reporting team member whose face was half-covered by glasses.

"Did you go to the gun emplacements?" Ensign Matsukaze asked back.

"Because the moonlight was good, the enemy planes could be spotted immediately without any mistakes when they attacked, so I went to take pictures of the anti-aircraft guns fighting the enemy."

"What was the result? Did you take good pictures?" Ensign Matsukaze asked.

"No. When the guns fired, a cloud of dust rose up beside them, so it was impossible to take pictures. It can be said that it was a complete failure." The bespectacled man laughed and continued to tell the story of that time.

"But because it was a complete failure, Mr. Taniyama laughed at me."

"What exactly happened?"

"Enemy aircraft B-17 lowered its altitude and boldly strafed with machine guns. It's not easy to deal with machine gun strafing, so everyone was shouting 'Where's the air-raid shelter? Where's the air-raid shelter?' And there was someone shouting above them. There are no air-raid shelters in the gun emplacement area! If you're afraid of machine guns, hide in the ammunition depot! This was said in a terrible and loud voice. The one who made this sound was Lieutenant Taniyama. He told me to give you his regards."

"Taniyama commanded the cannons?" "I don't know what he usually does, but last night he was commanding the searchlights. This is really not an easy task. The enemy's machine guns were of course going to concentrate on shooting at this place, not to mention that there was our own anti-aircraft gun position right next to it. What's more, the naval forces also concentrated their fire on this place. The fragments of the anti-aircraft shells exploded in the sky and fell like raindrops. In this hail of bullets, Taniyama resolutely commanded without moving. Lieutenant Taniyama is very tall and has a large physique, he is very magnificent. This scene should be painted." As he said this, he turned to the oil painter from the art team.

Ensign Matsukaze said to Lieutenant Edo:

"Taniyama and I were in the same class in high school, university, and artillery school. I heard that his father was a local official for a long time, so he can be said to be from a prestigious family."

"University graduate officers are also quite active in this area!"

Lieutenant Edo simply had a different experience, and because he was also a reserve officer, he felt particularly interested.

At this time, the bald team member noticed Edo's collar badges and said, "Which school did you graduate from?"

Ensign Matsukaze interjected to answer:

"Edo graduated from a higher merchant marine school, so his service is different from ours. It seems he will be serving on a torpedo boat."

"Torpedo boat, that's really refreshing. Mr. Edo, I wish you success on your first mission." Reporting Team Member Nanjo smiled with a sigh and stroked his bald head. (Source: Asahi Shimbun)

### Suicide Case of a Female Teacher: All Sectors Express Discontent and Demand Legal Sanctions Against the Offending Parent

(1) According to reports, a female teacher at Sacred Heart Elementary School on Pingliang Road was abused and beaten by a parent who came to the school because she had disciplined a student, leading to the teacher's death from anger. This is truly infuriating. At a time when prices are soaring and life is difficult, teachers are among the most impoverished in all professions. However, teachers, with the spirit of enlightening the people, patiently and earnestly guide and teach children all day long, nurturing talents who will become the pillars of society and the foundation of the country in the future. The importance and magnitude of their responsibility is known to all. How could this parent be so unreasonable, disregarding the dignity of teachers, and instead insulting them, leading to a terrible disaster? The teacher's future is unimaginable. I ask, when children enter school, they most need the strict discipline of teachers. Even if they are given minor punishments, there is no reason to complain. It is even more questionable that the school authorities stood by and watched during this dispute. Alas! Where is the protection of education? The cheapness of human life is evident. I cannot help but cry aloud for this lonely and helpless woman. I believe this matter will be condemned by social justice and sanctioned by national law, and will surely be vindicated in this world, never to be left with injustice underground! (Ms. Wenmei)

(2) Mr. Su Yi, because he was beaten and insulted by a student's parent, died from poisoning with grievance, sacrificing himself for education. All of us are indignant upon hearing this. Educating children is the teacher's duty. Although it is a time of high prices, teachers' income cannot support the whole family, but we have never seen anyone neglecting education due to financial difficulties. Every teacher educates for the sake of education, cultivating the future masters of the country. Since Mr. Su was a teacher, it was his duty to educate children. If a student's textbook is not submitted on time, they should of course be punished. Since the student Liu Zhijun violated the rules, he should be sanctioned. If the teacher did not pursue the matter, it would be the teacher's fault. Why didn't the parent severely reprimand the student, but instead believed what he said and questioned and insulted the teacher? And the parent is neither a plant nor a cold-blooded animal, how could he not distinguish right from wrong and act arbitrarily? This is no less than an insult to our entire education community. All of us are unable to seek justice for Mr. Su due to our limited strength. We hereby appeal to people from all walks of life and the wise education authorities of the city to support all schools. Sincerely, the entire faculty of Si Gao Middle and Elementary School.

(3) Having read the news of the teacher who died from humiliation in your newspaper, I cannot help but feel indignant. It is within the teacher's duty to punish students. How can the student's parent interfere? Now, Liu's mother does not discipline her son, but arrogantly goes to the school to insult the teacher, bullying her because she is a lonely and weak woman, leading to a fatal incident. It is hateful and lamentable. After being humiliated, Mr. Su had resentment and anger in his chest, and his cry for help was hidden in his heart, leading to his death, which can be described as tragic. I ask the wise authorities to not only order the parent to bear all the funeral expenses required by Mr. Su, but also to impose severe punishment, so that Mr. Su, though holding resentment in the nine springs, can also rest in peace, and can also prohibit student parents from interfering in school affairs again.
