### Request to City Authorities for Strict Suppression of Gambling

Gambling is the most prevalent "evil habit" among the people. On a small scale, it leads to wasted time and unemployment, causing personal tragedy; on a large scale, it harms society and brings disgrace to the nation. Looking at the actual situation in our city, gambling venues are crowded with gamblers, and spending thousands of gold coins with a single wave of the hand is considered commonplace. Consequently, all kinds of evil and wicked deeds arise from this. We have investigated recent cases of corruption, speculation, private dealings, and even murder and robbery, and almost all of them are related to gambling dens. If anyone is willing to carefully examine the social news in the newspapers and the records of civil and criminal cases in the judicial organs, it would not be an exaggeration to say that gambling is the sole source of criminal behavior in the city today. As for the general public and families using gambling as a means of entertainment and socializing, it has become regarded as a matter of course. Refusing an invitation is considered ignorant of human relationships. Therefore, if the consumption of spirit, time, money, and legitimate business in everyday gambling is statistically analyzed, the shocking numbers in this city alone are probably beyond the imagination of gamblers.

Recently, the authorities, due to the "rampant gambling, neglect of duties, corruption of customs, leading to the abandonment of discipline and moral degradation, which is extremely hateful," have issued an order for "strict investigation and suppression; those who deliberately violate the order will be immediately arrested and severely punished as a warning to others." (April 7th, Nanjing Central News Agency dispatch). However, the ban should not be limited to Nanjing alone, but must extend to all parts of the country, and should not be considered sufficient with a temporary order, but must be persistent, striving to eliminate favoritism and completely eradicate gambling. We believe that not only gambling dens that operate for profit and their disguised forms, such as so-called tea rooms and dance halls, must be thoroughly investigated and suppressed, but also the so-called "leisure-time entertainment" of everyday gambling must be strictly prohibited. At the same time, government agencies and civil servants should take the lead by setting an example; anyone found guilty of gambling and confirmed should be treated as absent without leave, and those with more serious circumstances should be dismissed. Furthermore, major factories and companies should automatically and strictly prevent and warn employees against gambling, and pay special attention to those who arrive late or leave early. This is not only a fundamental way to prevent corruption, but also the first step to improve administrative efficiency or increase productivity. From the perspective of the entire society, strictly prohibiting gambling is the first step in improving customs, preventing treachery, and realizing wartime life. From the perspective of current national policy, strictly prohibiting gambling is a prerequisite for promoting frugality, eliminating extravagance, and concentrating manpower and resources to achieve "total war participation." "Do not refrain from doing good because it is small." We hope that the authorities will advance the work of eliminating gambling with the courage of a broadsword. We remember that a year ago, gambling was openly prevalent in Shanghai's Fourth District, but after the Shanghai West Gendarmerie authorities resolved to ban it, gambling dens in that district had no place to stand. This proves that banning gambling is not a difficult problem, but depends on the determination of the authorities. At the same time, we believe that since gambling dens have been banned in the Shanghai West area, why can they still exist in the Nanshi area? Secondly, there are no more open gambling venues in the Public Concession area, but there are still some in the French Concession area. Being within the same Shanghai city limits, there should not be such differences, let alone such a labor-intensive and financially draining gambling phenomenon in wartime life.

However, at the same time, we must recognize that gambling is a characteristic of national backwardness and unhealthy social life. If this root cause is not eradicated, even the most vigorous bans will only be effective for a short time. Moreover, our country has been weak and poor for a long time, and there are often special circumstances in various places. In the past, a certain province in the Southwest openly used opium sales as the main source of revenue for a province's budget, and today, some regions may use gambling dens as a source of funding for certain expenses, or some people may rely on gambling to maintain their livelihoods. This situation, of course, is an improper phenomenon of "drinking poison to quench thirst," but we should not ignore it. Therefore, when strictly prohibiting gambling, sufficient preparation is necessary, especially to take care of a group of people who used to make a living from gambling, so as not to force them to take risks, and to provide appropriate education to enable them to engage in legitimate occupations. On the active side, we must mobilize the cultural, educational, and journalistic circles to promote the New Culture and wartime life movement, improve national culture, and develop legitimate entertainment. In particular, popularizing drama, movies, song and dance, increasing cultural parks, clubs, and libraries, and promoting sports, skills, and athletic competitions will enable the general public to walk on a bright and happy path and automatically break away from the ghost den of gambling.

Theoretical Discussion

### Strengthening the Tojo Cabinet

The Tojo Cabinet implemented a reshuffle of cabinet members on the 21st, which is undoubtedly a preparation for striving for victory. Therefore, rather than calling it a cabinet reshuffle or a cabinet member transfer, it is more appropriate to say that it is a strengthening of the Tojo Cabinet. This time, strengthening the cabinet certainly has its reasons and causes, but we do not want to explore the so-called inside story of the political world.

If one obsessively investigates such news and information, one will lose sight of the essence. Who would believe that the new cabinet members from the old political parties represent the revival of political party power? The appointment of Yamazaki and Oasa, making the pillars of the Seiyokukai, the center of parliamentary power, cabinet members, lies in establishing a truly united national stance. We should accept and accommodate this measure of strengthening the cabinet from a positive perspective. It is gratifying that the Tojo Cabinet can achieve a strong posture adapted to the new stage of the war.

Regarding the reshuffle of the Foreign Minister, which is of most concern to people living abroad, we do not need to think about the reasons for the retirement of the former Foreign Minister Tani, but rather take a positive attitude to anticipate the future diplomatic activities that Foreign Minister Shigemitsu will unfold. Since the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, the scope of current diplomatic activities seems to have been limited a lot. However, there is still a lot of diplomatic work with neutral countries, especially with the Soviet Union, where the Ministry of Foreign Affairs still bears a great diplomatic task. The new Foreign Minister Shigemitsu has rich diplomatic experience and has served as an envoy to the Soviet Union. Now he is in this position, which is a good use of his talents. Moreover, he knows the situation in China very well and can work side by side with Aoki, the Minister of Greater East Asia, who has also been stationed in China. The Tojo Cabinet's policy towards China will undoubtedly be broad, and its policy towards the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will definitely be promoted smoothly and powerfully.

However, in the context of cabinet member changes, there is not much meaning in discussing the experience, skills, and ambitions of the new cabinet members. We believe that this reshuffle was unavoidable in order to strengthen the Tojo Cabinet; we also believe that strengthening the cabinet and consolidating the politically united national stance will contribute more to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Everything comes from the necessity of advancing the war, which is a measure of unified orientation. Therefore, the cabinet reshuffle was necessary long ago. Not only will the established national policy not be shaken in the slightest by the reshuffle, but it will also be promoted more actively due to the cabinet reshuffle. Therefore, the four words "strengthening the cabinet" are very clear without being explicitly stated. During a political change or cabinet reshuffle, there is often excessive internal observation and divergent opinions. Such speculation only provides the enemy with materials for counter-propaganda, which we must be cautious about in wartime. (Yun Li: Translated from the April 22nd Mainland New Daily)

### Flying to Bangkok on the Way Home Remarks to the Press Corps

Bangkok, 22nd (Central News Agency) Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki and his party arrived here by plane from Saigon this morning. Japanese Ambassador to Thailand Taira, military attachés of the army and navy, the Thai Foreign Minister, the Director of Protocol, and representatives of the military and civilians of both Japan and Thailand welcomed them at the airport. Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia disembarked the plane amidst the salute of the Thai Air Force honor guard, and then took a car specially prepared by the Thai government to the dormitory for rest.

Bangkok, 22nd (Central News Agency) Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki and his party arrived here at 11:35 am today. At noon, they had lunch with Ambassador Taira at the Japanese Embassy in Thailand. At 2:00 pm, they first visited the Cai Baoshi Buddha, then went to the Thai Royal Family and the Regent's Office to pay their respects, and visited Prime Minister Pibul. Foreign Minister Ward and Chairman of the People's Assembly Borot, and General Bahon, respectively, paid their respects, and then went to the Thai Victory Monument to offer wreaths. After visiting a certain unit of the Japanese army and the military attaché's office of the army and navy, they returned to the embassy to instruct the staff and listen to reports.

Bangkok, 22nd (Central News Agency) After Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki arrived in Bangkok today, he met with the Thai press corps at his residence at 3:00 pm and made a statement, the gist of which is: I have long desired to visit our allied country of Thailand. I am very happy to have the opportunity to visit your country during my inspection of various places in the South. This trip is not to carry out a special official mission, but as the responsible minister of the Japanese foreign policy in the Greater East Asia region, I personally went to the various places in the South to inspect the actual situation, and held talks with the governments of the countries concerned in order to deepen mutual understanding. During this visit to your country, I deeply admire the efforts of your country's leaders in governing the country, promoting the national spirit, and the great spirit of your country's people uniting and supporting your country's leaders with a firm determination to strive to realize their ideals in this period of great change in the world. In addition, it is worthy of congratulations that your country's army has overcome many difficulties and achieved great results in the northern front. Moreover, in this war, if we, the allied countries, cannot unite to defeat Britain and the United States, then we will forever lose the opportunity to eradicate the root of their centuries of aggression in East Asia. The vast land of Greater East Asia will also be completely turned into a colony of Britain and the United States. The autonomy and independence that the Thai people have always loved will also be trampled by them. Japan and its allies have now established a solid foundation for inevitable victory, and the strategic areas and abundant economic resources that Japan has secured have become increasingly stronger. No matter how Britain and the United States launch a counterattack in the future, Japan's combat power will never shake our determination, nor will it shake our unity. There is no doubt about it. Japan has always been a country of faith and righteousness. It is also a country that repays kindness with kindness. Japan is deeply grateful for the sincere cooperation that Thailand has given to Japan in completing the Greater East Asia War. Japan will spare no effort to cooperate as much as possible for the prosperity of Thailand and the well-being of the Thai people. I deeply hope that the people of your country will further strengthen their belief in victory and their cooperation with Japan in the future, and strive to complete the Greater East Asia War.

### Anniversary of the Reorganization of the Second Front Army Chairman Wang Specially Issues Instructions Commander-in-Chief Sun Liangcheng Also Expresses His Determination

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) The 22nd is the anniversary of the reorganization of the Second Front Army. The Military Commission, in the instructions specially issued by Chairman Wang, encouraged all officers and soldiers to contribute everything to the country with a spirit of deep wisdom and courage. Commander-in-Chief Sun Liangcheng also issued his anniversary thoughts, expressing his determination to defend the motherland and protect East Asia. The following is a partial record:

Chairman Wang's Instructions Today is the anniversary of the reorganization of the Second Front Army. This Chairman is extremely excited. On this day last year, Commander-in-Chief Sun and all the officers and soldiers, based on their patriotic enthusiasm, abandoned the misguided resistance and participated in the bright peace. Their automatic reorganization was a manifestation of true knowledge and insight. The teachings of the National Father have long indicated to us to "save China through peace and struggle," and to cooperate with Japan to realize "Pan-Asianism." We must strive to follow them to the death, otherwise, although we are patriotic in name, we are actually harming the country; although we are protecting the people in name, we are actually harming the people. Moreover, now that the peace movement has entered the stage of participating in the war, it is the time for China to strive for independence and freedom. All the officers and soldiers of our Second Front Army should promote their original intentions, work hard and diligently, be loyal and trustworthy, contribute everything to the group of families, be wise and courageous, rectify the army and prepare for war, so as to join hands with our friendly country of Japan to complete the Greater East Asia Liberation War, and to achieve the great mission of reviving China and protecting East Asia. The bright future of the country and the people, the honor and disgrace of all of you officers and soldiers, are all tied to this. Let us encourage each other.

Commander-in-Chief Sun's Thoughts

Fellow compatriots, fellow comrades, on this day last year—April 22nd, our army, in view of the people's suffering from the futile resistance and the impossibility of helping the current crisis, resolutely and decisively telegraphed for reorganization. Under the leadership of our highest leader, Chairman Wang, we followed the national policy of "peace, anti-communism, and nation-building," and closely cooperated with our friendly country of Japan to fight for the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. Thanks to the full assistance of the friendly army and the enthusiastic guidance of all the officers and soldiers, all the officers and soldiers of our army know what to be inspired by and devote their loyalty and courage to repay the country. I am very pleased with this. Time flies like a shuttle. In the blink of an eye, a week has passed. When we hold the anniversary commemoration today, when we look back on the past and look forward to the future, we cannot help but feel touched in our hearts and inform our compatriots and comrades, and take this opportunity to express our encouragement to all the officers and soldiers of our army. After telegraphing for reorganization, I have already stated that the resistance cannot be sustained. Therefore, what the officers and soldiers of our army have worked hard to do in the past year is to devote themselves to the peace movement and to support participation in the war. These two major tasks and missions are connected to each other in the vertical aspect and run in parallel in the horizontal aspect. From resistance to peace, and then to participating in the Greater East Asia War, it has always been a consistent proposition. Our government authorities have repeatedly indicated to us. I believe that the current way to save the country is nothing more than peace and war. If peace is hopeless, there is only war. If peace comes, we can abandon war and seek peace. If war is death, and not war is also death, then there is only war to show the personality of a loyal, brave, and patriotic person. If war is death, and peace is survival, but we are still exhausting our troops and prolonging the war, it is no different from leading beasts to eat people. Not only will the people be unable to live, but it will also ruin the country. The purpose of the resistance is to seek the survival and independence of the country. If the war can be ended with a peace that is in line with justice, then the survival and independence of the country can be guaranteed. Therefore, our army should respond to the needs of the times, observe the direction of the people's hearts, and make a proposition of conscience. On this day last year, we resolutely telegraphed to participate in the peace camp, still based on the consistent spirit of teaching the country in the past, and worked hard for the peace movement. However, there are many thorns in the future of the peace movement. The Communist Party is causing trouble internally, and Britain and the United States are provoking externally, all of which are enough to undermine China's peace and East Asia's construction. Our friendly country of Japan has insight into the international situation, penetrates the conspiracy of the Communist Party, and the ambition of Britain and the United States. It is confirmed that unless we seek to prevent communism, we will not be able to eradicate the red scourge, and unless we destroy Britain and the United States, we will not be able to liberate East Asia. Therefore, Japan does not hesitate to make the greatest sacrifices, on the one hand, resolutely prevents communism to curb the spread of materialistic red, and on the other hand, advances the holy war to eliminate imperialist aggressors from East Asia. Since our National Government returned to the capital, it has also been based on this common goal for common struggle. It has already decided on the grand plan of peace and announced the policy of participating in the war, and indicated the purpose of sharing weal and woe and living and dying together, cooperating with our friendly country to overcome the difficulties of the times, and promote the great achievements of nation-building and promoting Asia. I am in charge of the division of the army, and my responsibility is to defend the country. I only know how to obey the orders of my superiors, be realistic, bury myself in hard work, and not indulge in empty words or showy decorations. Therefore, as far as I can do, I am cautious and diligent. Because of practice, since the reorganization, I have made it an urgent task to eliminate the Communist bandits, appease the refugees, and consolidate the security of the rear, so as to support the progress of the Greater East Asia War and make full peace a reality as soon as possible. All the officers and soldiers of our army should first understand the true meaning of peace and participation in the war, and strengthen their beliefs and centralize their will. We must strive to enforce discipline, refresh our ranks, take the same steps, endure hardships, unite in one wind, and go to the opportunity together. With the heart of loving the people, we love the people, and with the power to support the dangerous and stabilize the country, we defend the country. This is what I earnestly encourage all the officers and soldiers of our army on the anniversary of the reorganization. The overall peace of China and the final victory of East Asia are the goals. I believe that in the near future, we will be joyful and dance and sing songs of victory together. I wish that our compatriots and comrades will do their best efforts. I can't help but pray for it.

### The Ministry of Finance Continues Investigation of Shanghai Financial Institutions; Responsible Official of the Ministry Issues Statement

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch)

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - In order to strengthen the wartime economic system, the National Government is actively promoting all economic construction and sparing no effort. Recently, in order to stabilize prices and suppress speculative hoarding, it has specially dispatched officials to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation and impose appropriate penalties. A reporter specially interviewed the responsible official of the Ministry of Finance, who kindly informed them of the handling of the matter as follows: "Previously, the Ministry believed that speculation in Shanghai was rampant and prices were soaring daily. The root cause lies in the abundance of floating capital, which has not been brought under regulation. If strict restrictions are not imposed, the national economy and the people's livelihood will be severely affected. In order to eliminate hidden dangers, the Ministry has formulated three measures to restrict loans from silver and money shops, strictly ordering the industry associations of silver and money shops in various places to abide by them and to supervise each other's strict implementation. This time, a large-scale speculative hoarding of important materials was discovered in Shanghai. After investigation, it was confirmed that Han Gongbei of the Zhenhua Company was indeed illegally hoarding important materials, and the Futong Bank was suspected of being heavily involved. The National Government has issued a clear order for separate penalties. As for the Futong Bank under the jurisdiction of the Ministry, it has reported its compliance with the Ministry's order to temporarily suspend business and await thorough investigation. Deposits of all depositors will continue to be paid as usual. In order to conduct a thorough investigation, the Ministry has repeatedly sent letters to the Financial Business Inspection Office and the Ministry's Shanghai Office, instructing them to continue actively investigating unfinished matters related to financial institutions. If financial institutions are found to have engaged in illegal speculation and hoarding, they will be severely punished to ensure that hoarders disappear, prices stabilize, to secure the people's livelihood and stabilize finance, so that the wartime economic system can be smoothly advanced."

### Japanese Embassy in Beijing Places North China Enemy Nationals; Group Accommodation Centers Established in Shandong Province

Beijing, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch)

The Beijing Office of the Japanese Embassy in China, in order to stabilize the lives of enemy nationals residing in North China and Mengjiang and to prevent their conspiracies and actions to prevent the activities of the Fifth Column, has been preparing since January of this year to enable enemy nationals to engage in collective living. It has now selected the American Presbyterian Church in Tan County and Zhifu, Shandong Province, as accommodation centers. Various facilities have been completed by early last month and accommodation has begun. As of the 31st, 2,108 people have been accommodated. The enemy nationals accommodated this time are all enemy nationals in China who have severed diplomatic relations with Japan. Those who are sick and seeking medical treatment are not included. By nationality, there are 935 British, 598 American, 282 Belgian, 248 Dutch, and 45 others. The accommodation centers are equipped with dining halls, assembly halls, bars, hospitals, etc. Living conditions are based on their national customs, and all measures are extremely fair and courteous.

Enemy Nationals Accommodation Center Established in Guangzhou

Guangzhou, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese Minister for Greater East Asia Affairs, for the convenience of security and counter-espionage, previously instructed Japanese agencies in various parts of China to select suitable locations to accommodate enemy nationals scattered throughout China in groups. The Japanese Consulate General in Guangzhou, after receiving this order, established the "Guangdong Enemy Nationals Group Living Center" in the Henan area of Guangzhou City and has moved the enemy nationals in that area into the center on January 25th of this year. The buildings of the Group Living Center were formerly the American Oriental Missionary Society. The enemy nationals currently accommodated include 33 Americans and 13 British, totaling 46. The purpose of this group accommodation is solely for counter-espionage purposes, so in addition to cutting off their contact with the outside world, their internal life is extremely free. Those with families are allowed to live together and enjoy entertainment and sports, and the facilities are fully equipped. Therefore, they are all deeply grateful for the generous measures taken by the Japanese authorities.

### Head of Manchukuo Local Officials Inspection Group An Jiyun Discusses Purpose of Visit to China

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch)

The Manchukuo Local Officials Administrative Inspection Group has come to China for sightseeing. A reporter specially interviewed the head of the group, Mr. An Jiyun, currently a councillor of the General Affairs Agency of the Manchukuo State Council, on the 22nd, while the group was staying in Beijing. Mr. An kindly answered the reporter's questions as follows:

(Question) What is the mission of your group's visit to China?

(Answer) Manchukuo's purpose in visiting China is to strengthen the economic effectiveness of mutual communication, borrowing strengths, and supplementing weaknesses between the axis of China, Japan, and Manchukuo in East Asia, and to examine the political facilities of the emerging China to be used as a reference for domestic administration. At the same time, because the unity between countries depends on mutual understanding, more visits mean more understanding. This is the second purpose of our group's visit to China. Because China has experienced disturbances, consecutive years of disasters, and poor harvests, we, based on the initial intentions of caring for our own countries, loving our neighbors, and loving East Asia together, feel that it is necessary to provide assistance. Earlier this month, Chinese Special Envoy Mr. Zhou Fohai visited Manchukuo, and it is firmly believed that the relationship between China and Manchukuo will become closer in the future, and the economies of the two countries will benefit more. Our group's visit to China is also to examine the needs of the allied country China to serve as a guideline for increasing production in various places after returning home. This is the third purpose of our visit to China.

(Question) What is the reason for the smooth distribution of materials in your country?

(Answer) The distribution of materials first investigates the existing materials in the area, creates a household register, and distributes them evenly. As for the prerequisite for suppressing prices, it is nothing more than first investigating the quantity of existing commodities, especially strictly prohibiting private hoarding, restricting the free movement of unscrupulous merchants, and setting prices so that prices do not rise. More should be to practice frugal consumption and increase the tax rate on luxury goods so that they lose purchasing power and naturally reduce the ability to consume. On the one hand, the government encourages production and provides farmers with low-interest loans. Those who meet the set annual increase standard will have the special privilege of enjoying the distribution of a large number of daily necessities. The government raises the standard every year, and the production rate also increases frequently, prices are suppressed, and supply exceeds demand, so the distribution of materials can be smoothly promoted.

(Question) What are your impressions after inspecting Beijing?

(Answer) In the three years since the Republic of China returned to the capital, all political, economic, cultural, and other facilities have been developing rapidly. The general public can carry out the New Citizen Movement, unite sincerely, and the future is bright and promising.

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch)

Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association Deputy President Ando has now been appointed Minister of Internal Affairs, and after careful consideration by President Tojo, it was decided to promote Goto Fumio, the current Secretary-General of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, to fill the vacancy of Deputy President. At 1:00 p.m. today, President Tojo summoned Mr. Goto to the Prime Minister's residence and, after discussing the matter, obtained his consent and formally appointed him on the same day.

Since May of last year, he has served as Secretary-General and is the master of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. This promotion to Deputy President will not have a special impact on the inside, but because he has a close relationship with former Deputy President Ando, the relationship between the government and the Imperial Rule Assistance Association will be closer, and at this stage of the war, the promotion of the Imperial Rule Assistance Movement to supplement the function of administration and the harmony with the internal administration of Minister of Internal Affairs Ando can be expected to operate appropriately and vigorously."

Berlin Welcomes Partial Reorganization of the Japanese Cabinet

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency Dispatch)

After the news of the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet was released, all sectors here unanimously expressed their welcome. Knowledgeable sources commented as follows: (1) This reorganization of the Japanese cabinet is purely due to internal affairs, and Japan's national policy will not change as a result. (2) The Japanese government's appointment of influential figures from political parties and respected figures in the diplomatic community shows Prime Minister Tojo's determination to gather the total strength of Japan's 100 million people and establish a decisive battle system to win the final victory. (3) Foreign Minister Shigemitsu is a first-class Japanese diplomat, and his diplomatic skills have always been admired by the European diplomatic community. Therefore, after Mr. Shigemitsu took office as Foreign Minister and Mr. Amau took office as Director-General of the Information Bureau, the diplomatic and propaganda lineup of the Japanese government will definitely be strengthened. In addition, Dr. Horn, a diplomatic correspondent for the German official news agency, said that the German political circles have a very good impression of the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet on Tuesday night, and said that the new Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Kui will definitely intensify Japan's policy in Greater East Asia. The correspondent pointed out that Shigemitsu has repeatedly visited Germany, so he is also well-known in Germany, and the German Foreign Ministry believes that he is one of Japan's most capable diplomats. Dr. Horn also praised Shigemitsu's achievements in promoting Sino-Japanese relations and stressed that Shigemitsu, when he was the ambassador to the United Kingdom, never left any doubts about Japan's attitude towards the Axis powers.

Britain Remains Silent

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to Reuters London, the British government remained silent on this cabinet reshuffle in Japan, and the official did not criticize it. However, knowledgeable sources attached great importance to Mr. Shigemitsu's appointment as Foreign Minister because he had served as Ambassador to the United Kingdom and then transferred to Ambassador to China, believing that Japanese Prime Minister Tajo obviously wanted to strengthen the relationship between China and Japan diplomatically and coordinate the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Greater East Asia Ministry internally.

### Mushanokoji Writes Article on the Advantages of Eastern Spiritual Culture; China-Japan Cooperation is Essential for its Promotion

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch)

Japanese famous writer Saneatsu Mushanokoji recently went to Nanjing as a representative of the Japanese cultural community to attend the second conference of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association and interacted with people from the Chinese cultural community. After returning to Japan, he wrote an article from the perspective of the world's art history, pointing out the beauty of Eastern spiritual culture. The gist is as follows: (1) The mission of East Asia, as I see it, is that Europe was once more advanced than Asia in terms of civilization, and this is indeed a fact. Also, we have learned a lot from them, and this is also a fact. At present, in terms of material civilization, they (especially the UK and the US) are superior to us, which is even more of a fact. However, they are complacent and despise us, and they consider themselves qualified to dominate Asia. And because they consider themselves the masters of the world, they discriminate against people of color. They also believe that dominating Asia is necessary for world culture, so when they dominate Asia, they do not consider this to be an immoral act but rather consider it to be saving Asia. At the same time, their arrogant attitude has fallen into a state of being unable to save themselves, and it is inevitable that they will use all the resources of Asia for their living culture. Taking the UK's attitude towards India as an example, it is not only extremely obvious but also fully expresses its ambition, so they must regard Asia as no different from India. However, they will eventually fail due to their arrogance, and at this point, Asian culture will shine again, and the mission of East Asia lies here. Western European countries such as Germany and Italy have fully recognized the mission of East Asia and believe that helping to promote Asian culture is necessary for their own culture. However, countries such as the UK and the US have not yet felt the mission of East Asia and still regard Asia as their prey, viewing Japan as a thorn in their side, and hindering Japan in various aspects. Japan, in unbearable circumstances, rose up resolutely, and the most peace-loving Emperor of Japan issued a great edict to propagate to the UK and the US, and we were moved by this holy heart, which is the mission of the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, this mission is completely in line with what all mankind hopes for. The UK and the US have successively returned the places they should have returned. However, not only have they not realized that their defeat was due to being conquered by the truth, but they have not stopped their ambition to dominate Asia and are still obsessed with it, exhausting all their efforts to try to satisfy their desires and wasting great sacrifices. In fact, the United States is the most foolish in this war. Except for the United States, other countries have no choice but to fight. Among them, there are those like the UK whose desires are too deep and will never give up, so they have no choice but to fight, so the United States also said that its participation in the war was out of necessity, but it was also okay if the United States did not fight, because if the United States did not participate in the war, it would definitely be a favorable country in the world. Not only would the country become richer and stronger, but its people would also live and work in peace. However, they actually wanted to get involved in the war, making unnecessary sacrifices, and the people of many countries had the illusion that only the United States could save the world, so this move by the United States was extremely foolish, but this was nothing more than a punishment from heaven for their arrogance. (2) Their ideas and culture are finally coming to an end. We can believe that new life is struggling in the world, and the greatest of these new things that will soon be produced is the recovery of East Asia. At the same time, it will soon become the revival of Asia. In fact, when China and Japan can fully cooperate with each other, it will be the time when Asia has declared its victory. The world is now looking forward to this day, so Japan rose up resolutely. In fact, the present is the middle of the war, and the rise and fall of East Asia can be determined today. We deeply feel the importance of this war, but we have no anxiety about the final victory. In this war, the truth is always by our side, and we are even more convinced that this is what mankind hopes for, and the mission of East Asia is first to liberate East Asia from the hands of the UK and the US. Its meaning is to make the people of the world aware of the mission of each having their place and creating their own culture, because there will never be a race in the world that considers itself only to be despised and not matter. We, with the qualifications of a despised race, first warn the UK and the US of the unreasonableness of despising races and urge them to reflect. It is true that their material civilization is more advanced than ours, but this is not because of the excellence of the race. We have only been slightly delayed in adopting world culture due to various reasons. However, we do not belittle their many excellent qualities. The only thing in the world that can best speak to the national character of a country is art. One can know its true nature at a glance. Among the paintings of various countries in the world, the one that can best express its arrogant character is the UK. Also, among the many portraits in the world, the portraits that are the most devoid of content and full of arrogant character are also from the UK. As for the paintings of the United States, they are the most pitiful. The nature of their paintings does not have advantages in terms of spirit, but the paintings that are extremely light and make people feel shallow are the ones they respect the most, so their paintings can never match the work of Korin in Japan, but there are more than a hundred people in Japan whose works are even better than Korin's. In East Asia, China has the most outstanding calligraphers and painters, while in the West, only Italy, France, and the Netherlands have outstanding painters. (3) They do not understand the deep interest in the paintings of the Arhats in East Asia, and they always say that they are the ugliness of the people of East Asia. This is because they cannot understand their spiritual depth. At the same time, they have no understanding of our simple and elegant places. We see the material civilization of New York in the United States, and it can really surprise us, but ask whether the value of human beings is estimated by material or by spirit? I believe that the value of human beings should be estimated by spirit. They do not know what kind of life the Christian Church that they respect the most is living. I wonder if they have ever really thought about it. We will make them understand the spiritual purity and joy that they have forgotten. Of course, there are also things that the Eastern people do not know, but we should awaken their stubbornness to the beauty of nature and the beauty of elegant culture, so that they can live in their proper places and have a sense of satisfaction. At the same time, let them know that the world should respect each other in order to be happy. The above is the important task of our cultural community in East Asia. At least in the West, there are people who have progressed in spirit, and I am afraid they have felt that Western culture has come to an end, and they hope that the original culture of the East will grow healthily with the taste it has gained from the world and complete what they deeply entrust. I hope we can cooperate with each other to complete this great mission.

### Tunisia Region: Great Battle Enters Fourth Stage; Two Fierce Attacks on Enfidaville Fail; British Eighth Army Suffers Heavy Losses from Landmines

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reported last night: On Tuesday, the British Eighth Army repeatedly launched fierce attacks on the Axis forces' bridgehead south of the northeastern Tunisian stronghold, but were repelled by the German-Italian allied forces. Berlin claims that the current fighting is the fourth stage of the Tunisian War, which began on the evening of the 1st. The British army has been attacking in the Enfidaville area for 24 hours without any progress. In the first night's attack, the British army suffered heavy losses due to landmines. After several hours of shelling, they launched a second attack, which also failed and they retreated.

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to news received here on the 21st: The British Eighth Army has launched a general offensive on the southeastern Tunisian front for more than 36 hours, but has not yet broken through the Axis forces' strong positions. As for the course of the battle, the British army first launched a fierce artillery bombardment on the Axis positions near Enfidaville on the night of the 19th, and then began a new offensive. The range of the attack was more than 20 kilometers wide, but it suffered heavy casualties due to landmines planted by the Axis forces. Thus, the British army's first day of attack failed. The next day, the British army resumed the attack. Although they broke through several Axis positions, they were retaken by the Axis forces after a fierce counterattack. Currently, the terrain of the positions set up by the Axis forces is not suitable for large-scale tank warfare, especially the western defense line, which is mostly mountainous. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces launched an offensive in the more flat area of Enfidaville. In short, because the anti-Axis forces cannot attack the Axis positions from the side, they have to attack head-on. However, it will be difficult for the anti-Axis forces to make rapid progress in a frontal offensive.

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The fourth round of the Tunisian War seems to have begun. After several hours of intense artillery preparation, the British Eighth Army launched an attack on the southern flank of the German-Italian forces' positions with strong troops on the evening of April 20th. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. It was claimed here yesterday: So far, all major attacks by the anti-Axis forces have been repelled. The anti-Axis forces only entered the Axis positions at a few strongholds, but were quickly driven back. The area of Enfidaville near the coast is the focus of the battle in the southern Tunisian front. General Montgomery's British troops have assembled a large force in this area in an attempt to break through the Italian-held line. At present, the enemy's attempts in this area cannot be considered successful, and the attacking British troops have been repelled. The Italian army also counterattacked and regained the temporarily lost territory. The Italian army at each stronghold was almost able to drive the enemy back to the original line. The terrain in the combat area makes it extremely difficult for large tanks to operate. The German side claims that the German-Italian forces in the middle and western sections of the front occupy high ground and are not easily attacked by tank units. Only on the southern flank, especially in the Enfidaville area, is the terrain relatively flat and larger forces can be deployed. However, military experts in Berlin believe that a flanking maneuver is not possible in the current Tunisian front. The British and American forces can only try to break through the wide front. Berlin remains optimistic about the situation in this area.

### Axis Forces Defend with Natural Barriers, Forming a Siege Fortress Battle

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - A German military spokesman said last night: The Tunisian war has now become a siege fortress battle. The British General Montgomery's Eighth Army is fully equipped, and it can be said that it has everything needed for desert warfare. However, in the current fighting, most of this equipment has become useless, because in the Enfidaville area, only a small, narrow strip of land on the coast is suitable for large-scale tank warfare. The other parts of the Tunisian front are mountainous. If a large-scale offensive is to be launched, other methods must be used. Therefore, German military experts believe that the anti-Axis forces will encounter difficult problems in this new phase of the war. The German-Italian positions in the mountainous area form a semi-circle, surrounding the main strongholds of Tunis and Bizerte. Berlin calls it the Axis powers' main line of defense in North Africa. Compared with the battle for the Mareth Line a few days ago, the current battle can be called a battle for forward positions. It is believed here that the first offensive by the British and American forces has failed. Although the British have penetrated the enemy's line in several places, they have not been able to take advantage of it and have retreated after a German-Italian counterattack. Therefore, the entire line is still firmly held by the German-Italian forces and has not been shaken.

### Fierce Fighting Continues Between German and Soviet Forces in the Kuban Estuary Delta

Stockholm, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Anti-Axis newspapers in Moscow reported last night that German mountain troops, assisted by engineering units and Black Shirt sharpshooters, launched a fierce attack on the mountain positions held by the Soviet army in the Kuban estuary delta. The German official news agency said that German and Romanian mountain troops launched a fierce attack on Tuesday and expanded their high ground near Novorossiysk. News from Berna said that the German-Romanian allied forces, in close cooperation with the German Air Force, attacked the Soviet outpost positions and resisted Soviet counterattacks. Moscow claims that the German offensive in the Kuban estuary delta has been repelled by the Soviet army. Both sides suffered heavy damage in the fierce fighting. Moscow has confirmed active fighting in the Novorossiysk area, with successive attacks and counterattacks. The Soviet Black Sea Fleet landed troops west of Novorossiysk and attacked again, but Moscow admits that Novorossiysk itself is not under serious threat because the German army's strong defenses block the road to the port. According to anti-Axis reporters stationed in Moscow, the Soviet army continues to bombard German positions in the hope of overcoming German resistance. They believe that it is difficult for the German army to transport military supplies to the troops in the area. There were no significant developments in other areas of the Eastern Front last night.

### Germany Invents New Weapon; Tiger Tank Divisions to Join the War Soon

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Recent German statements regarding the development of German military technology have raised the question of when the German side will begin to use its latest weapon, the "Tiger" tank division, in combat. This new type of tank has been the focus of international attention in the past few weeks. Its turret can rotate 360 degrees, so it is the first motorized warfare vehicle that can fire in all directions. During the winter months, Germany has been working hard domestically, and the "Tiger" tank, which the German army will soon use in combat, is proof of this.

### Japan Willing to Strengthen Political and Economic Relations with Allied Nations; East Asia War Has Gained Operational Freedom; Japanese Ambassador to Italy Makes Remarks in Sofia

Sofia, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The new Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Noburo Hidaka, departed from here for Rome on the evening of the 20th. Before his departure, he met with a group of reporters and made remarks, mainly stating: The Japanese government hopes to strengthen political and economic relations with European allied nations participating in the Axis alliance and is prepared to assist Europe with abundant raw material resources. It intends to provide the greatest assistance to the Balkan countries. Japan attaches particular importance to its relationship with Bulgaria and hopes that relations between Japan and Bulgaria will become more stable. Japan, Germany, and Italy are currently conducting joint operations according to a common plan, so the activities of one country are closely related to the activities of the other two countries. Germany and Italy are building a new order based on justice in Europe, and Japan is also aiming to build the same new order in Greater East Asia. Relations between Japan and the Soviet Union are very normal, and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can be said to have achieved its intended purpose. No matter what attempts the United Kingdom and the United States make, we can wait for future developments with peace of mind. The United Kingdom and the United States are fighting in the Pacific and are unable to launch a major offensive. Japan is fully prepared for any major situation. In short, Japan has completed its planned operations in East Asia and is now completely free. The Japanese fleet and air force control the entire southwestern Pacific region, and in Burma, the British army has been paralyzed. The enemy will probably not be able to engage in combat before the end of May.

### President Roosevelt Visits Mexico

Rome, 22nd (Central News Agency) - A Stefani News Agency diplomatic correspondent claims: President Roosevelt's speech during his visit to Mexico revealed that the purpose of the trip was to resolve certain difficulties caused by the United States supplying Mexico with industrial and agricultural equipment, especially. On the other hand, Roosevelt's speech was actually just an appeal for Mexico to hand over its natural resources for the use of the United States. In short, Roosevelt's speech does not conceal the fact that he considers Mexico to be no different from an American colony, as the Americans plan to obtain the raw materials and labor they need from Mexico.

### Bosnia: Communist Bandits Have Been Eliminated

Currently, the food supply for the remaining bandits is becoming increasingly difficult, and they are even killing each other for food.

### Axis Forces Seize the Opportunity

(Special dispatch from Berlin, 15th) - The German-Italian Axis forces in a corner of northeastern Tunisia seem to want to defend Africa's only position to the death. Both the Axis and Allied camps have ulterior motives regarding the outcome of the North African war, and their secret plans are preconditions for the next major battle. The Asahi Shimbun's Berlin branch contacted its Lisbon branch by international long-distance telephone on the 15th to inquire about the situation in Tunisia. The questions and answers are recorded below.

Berlin Correspondent Mamoru Yamasato (Q): From Berlin's perspective, the situation in Tunisia is not very clear because the line of sight is not good. It is not entirely clear where the center of the battle is. You are in a neutral country and can obtain information from both sides. Please tell me something about the current situation.

Lisbon Correspondent Mogi (A): We can only see British newspapers a day late, so we can only get a general idea of ​​the enemy's intentions, but the real situation is not clear. Even some people who seem to be very clear are actually only half-knowing. The focus of public concern here is whether the combined forces of Rommel and Arnim can fight to the death to defend Tunis and Bizerte. What is the determination of the German and Italian armies?

(Q): This question has been carefully discussed at the recent meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, and it has already been decided. Of course, the content will not be told to the world. The German army is not so stupid as to announce this kind of confidential content. The enemy is afraid of not knowing the details, so why would the German army announce it?

(A): Axis officials here believe that Tunis and Bizerte will definitely be defended to the death. Just look at the example of the Soviet army refusing to give up Stalingrad to the death, and you can imagine this situation. Looking at the Soviet Union, even after the rear transport of a small number of troops in the Volga was cut off, they still defended a corner of Stalingrad to the death. Then, even if communication with Sicily is cut off in the North African war, it is not impossible to fight a long-term war if the Tunis and Bizerte fortresses are defended.

(Q): The German side now has great hope. With the Bizerte and Tunis fortresses as the center, a position is established in the nearby mountainous area, and the natural terrain that is sufficient for defense is used to form a solid turtle shell formation. On the other hand, because the enemy has advanced the front line by 2,500 kilometers, they urgently need to reorganize the rear supply line. If they want to launch a general offensive on this turtle shell position, they must reorganize their troops. As a result, the Axis forces in Tunisia are willing to find an opportunity to launch without losing time. This is the hope of Germany and the general view of the German people.

(A): Looking at the movements of Rommel's army, I think the word "time" is the most appropriate. In January of this year, the British always said that the Tunisian war would definitely end by the end of March. At least, the Soviet offensive would not weaken, and the landing operation would begin in Europe. However, this claim has not been realized because the main force of the Allied forces was led to North Africa by Rommel's army. If Kursk and Kharkov had been recovered by the Soviet army, and the North African war situation was as tense as it is now, then the Axis forces would inevitably face a major crisis. Now, because the Eastern Front has come to an end, the Axis forces will not suffer the disadvantage of fighting on two fronts. What do the German people think about this North African war?

(Q): The Germans here are able to remain calm and composed. The deep and painful expression of the Sixth Army when it was besieged in Stalingrad cannot be seen at all. There are various reasons for this: first, the war situation has not yet reached the severity of Stalingrad. The general public believes in General Rommel, because he is a famous general who can win by surprise, so Rommel's strategy of shrinking the front line and preparing for a surprise offensive is deeply trusted by the public. Second, there has been no concealment of the circumstances from the retreat from Egypt to Libya and Tunisia, so the German people are calm and understand the war principle that success and failure are common occurrences for soldiers. The Germans' shock at the Battle of Stalingrad was because the former German authorities did not tell the truth and concealed the facts for two months, and then announced the shocking truth when the situation was irreversible, so the people were saddened and discolored, but the situation in the North African war is very different, so there is no such shocking phenomenon.

(A): According to recent intelligence: From the 10th to the 11th of this month, British and American convoy ships passed through Gibraltar and entered the Mediterranean. This convoy is probably not going to the Tunisian front, but to merge with the troops waiting in Algeria for the second front, preparing for the next operation in advance.

In short, the Tunisian front is a guide to promote the European war, and it must not be taken lightly or ignored.

### Significance of the Meeting Between the Two Giants of Germany and Italy

(Special dispatch from Rome, Yamazaki, 12th) - The meeting between Hitler and Mussolini is the culmination of the previous meeting between Mussolini and Ribbentrop in Rome, and is a follow-up to that meeting. Rear Admiral Bori visited Italy, and Mussolini met with the prime ministers of Italy and Hungary, and Hitler met with King Boris of Bulgaria. A series of top-level meetings on the Axis side were held. The external significance is to respond to the European post-war management plan of the United Kingdom and the United States. That is to say, this meeting focused on the following two issues:

First, through the reconstruction and reorganization of the new order in Europe, Europe will be formed into a united and powerful collaborative body, making it the foundation for the execution of war and post-war management;

Second, with the foresight that this year will be the stage for the European War to reach a decision, concentrate the final efforts in all fields of military, political, and diplomatic affairs to create the most favorable new situation.

The first issue mentioned above was an unresolved issue from the previous meeting between Mussolini and Ribbentrop. This meeting, based on the sincere and frank opinions of the Italian side, realized closer cooperation between Germany and Italy, and cooperation between the countries under the leadership of the two countries. Here are the points:

(1) The solution of various pending issues between the two countries and all European countries, and the consideration of guarantees in accordance with what form;

(2) Efforts to resolve the Outer Transylvania (Transylvania) issue and Hungary's active participation in the current war;

(3) Strengthening Bulgaria's cooperation with allied countries;

Etc., will be specially discussed. In short, as proposed by Prime Minister Mussolini earlier:

"Although the nature of European countries and Asian countries is completely different, we can learn a lot from the attitude that Japan is taking regarding the construction of a new East Asia."

Judging from this claim, it is not difficult to imagine that the above-mentioned new reorganization must be carried out following the same guidelines and forms as the ideology of the new order in East Asia.

As for the second issue, it may be regarded as starting from the premise of the first issue, and is full of variability. That is:

(1) France's maintenance of public order and coastal defense; (2) Greece's defense; (3) Bulgaria's coastal defense and other defensive natures; and (4) the Eastern Front's offensive this summer: the future of the Tunisian Front, (6) changes in the situation in Turkey due to Bulgaria's active cooperation.

Etc., all military and political measures that should be dealt with under the current situation can be considered to have been reviewed. The United Kingdom and the United States have promoted the meeting between the two giants as being about how to defend against the intrusion of the United Kingdom and the United States into Europe. However, the meeting was originally scheduled to be held before the changes in the situation on the Tunisian front. However, the departure of Prime Minister Mussolini was delayed due to changes in the situation. The purpose of this meeting, guaranteed by the Italian government and the public, is not determined by some changes in a local battle, but is to thoroughly solve the fundamental problems within Europe and to build future development on this basis. Therefore, this meeting is by no means a passive defensive meeting, but a positive meeting for future construction. Its results, even if they are not how gorgeous, undoubtedly express its character extremely eloquently in the new European order and the execution of the war. (Ding: Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, April 14th)

### The Authorities Continue to Investigate Hoarding; Commodity Prices Gradually Stabilize; Hoarders Continuously Emerge, Supply Exceeding Demand; Retail Prices in Various Industries Show No Decline

Previously, the National Government, in view of the soaring commodity prices in Shanghai, which seemed endless, mostly attributed to speculative hoarding, believed that if such behavior was not thoroughly eliminated, it would have a significant impact on people's livelihoods. Therefore, it specially dispatched the Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to Shanghai to, together with Secretary-General Zhao of the Municipal Government and Supervisor Chen Yunwen of the Business Management Committee, jointly investigate hoarding and impose special penalties. It also supervised and urged strict handling of the lending business of various silver and money industries and banks, refusing loans for speculative hoarding purposes in accordance with the "Measures for Eliminating Secured Loans" promulgated by the Ministry, and at the same time, contracted previously released loans. As a result, hoarders have been in a state of panic recently, seeking to get out of their predicament. Market prices of various industries have gradually decreased. It is reported that the market conditions of important commodities continued to decline yesterday, and people's hearts have been more stable than in the past. The main reasons are: (1) The government authorities are continuing to thoroughly investigate hoarding, and are currently investigating the stockpiles in various warehouses. (2) The silver and money industries are refusing to grant new loans and recovering old loans, and hoarders with insufficient capital turnover are seeking to get out of their predicament. (3) The Business Management Committee is now actively carrying out control work. Since the matter of applying for permits for the movement of materials began, materials can be freely moved within the specified area, the circulation of goods is smooth, and with hoarders constantly emerging, the market presents a situation of supply exceeding demand. Due to the above problems, commodity prices are declining day by day. However, the retail prices of various business stores have not declined accordingly. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will pay close attention to this in order to achieve the practical effect of stabilizing people's livelihoods.

### The Japanese Army Press Department Yesterday Hosted the Press Corps, Describing the Weaknesses of the American Army in Various Aspects

The spokesperson of the Press Department of the Japanese Army in Shanghai, at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, at a regular meeting of the city's press corps, expressed his views on recent comments by British and American military critics on the Japanese-American war:

Unfavorable Terrain. First, he stated that the general American public has been repeatedly deceived by the U.S. government's propaganda reports, so they are unclear about the details of the Japanese-American war. Now, some American critics, with accurate judgment, have made detailed analyses and criticisms of the war situation announced by the U.S. government. The Japanese spokesperson first cited the American critics' explanation of the terrain, saying that there are currently three ways to attack Japan: (1) Using the mainland in Chongqing. Geographically speaking, although China is close to Japan, it is of no practical help in terms of military situation. In addition, transportation is inconvenient and full of difficulties. Even if air transport is used, the number of aircraft, manpower, materials, and gasoline are not enough for distribution, so it is difficult to achieve the illusory dream. (2) Using Australia as a base. However, the distance between Australia and the United States is far away. The journey from Los Angeles to Australia requires 12,000 nautical miles. Even with transport ships, ships are difficult to obtain and require refueling along the way. Even if they can reach Australia as desired, attacking the Japanese mainland to the north is separated by the South Seas. Moreover, the large and small islands near the Solomon Islands are all under Japanese control, and there is no attacking force. Therefore, the American critics said that if they want to attack the Japanese mainland, they must use naval and land forces to conquer all the large and small islands. (3) Furthermore, from Alaska to the Aleutian Islands, it is still questionable whether there is enough energy to replenish the distance in between. In addition, the journey is vast and transportation is difficult, so it is difficult to succeed.

Difficulties in Resources. Since the Japanese army began the Greater East Asia War, it had already occupied famous places in tropical, frigid, and temperate zones. Moreover, these places are rich in resources, which are not only fully utilized by Japan, but also actively engaged in production. All resources have fallen into Japanese hands. Therefore, if the United States plans to counterattack Japan, it must fully replenish each military force. However, it is already difficult to replenish. Furthermore, in terms of military strength, the United States intends to wage a protracted war and plans to increase its army to 8.5 million by next year. Otherwise, it will not achieve the purpose of counterattack. Now, regardless of that, sending troops from the United States to New Zealand requires mobilizing 1.05 million people in fact, based on calculations of its deployment. Therefore, with such a huge military force, it is even more difficult to fulfill the plan. Therefore, American military critics have specifically raised three major issues regarding the U.S. government's counterattack against Japan: terrain, resources, and troop mobilization. Their conclusion clearly reveals that it is difficult to achieve in fact. In particular, although troop strength can be trained and mobilized, when this huge number can be completed, we can get a glimpse of it by observing the current military strength of the United States.

Nothing Gained. The Japanese spokesperson also announced the situation of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing, using the southwestern area as an observation and judgment. It is said that since the end of March and the beginning of April of this year, the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing has made the delusion of sudden movement, dispatched from Guilin, Hunan. Its purpose was to attack the peaceful area and make silly dreams in Taiwan, Central China, or the Japanese mainland. As a result, it achieved nothing, only taking unconscious actions in the vicinity of the departure point, without any gains. Currently, the actual strength of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing is 150 to 160 aircraft, which are fighter planes and bombers. Among the bombers, there are very few large aircraft, which have the ambition to attack, but have no real strength. On the contrary, the strength of the Japanese Air Force in China is sufficient to cope with it. If the United States counterattacks, it must wait until the Japanese Air Force in China is completely wiped out. In addition, even if the United States can dispatch from the Chongqing base, the Japanese Air Force in China will immediately give it a head-on blow and wipe out its base, so that it cannot return. Therefore, the current actions of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing are only small-scale guerrilla warfare, taking advantage of unpreparedness to launch surprise attacks. However, before the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing replenishes its strength, we will not find it difficult to annihilate it. Finally, the Japanese spokesperson gave detailed instructions on air defense preparations, saying that we should not ignore it and should give it meticulous protection, etc.

### The Western District of Shanghai Today Sells the Tenth Phase of Household Rice

The tenth phase of household rice for April in the first and second districts of the western district of Shanghai, totaling 5,650 bags, has been shipped by the district's public sales office. It has been decided that it will be sold simultaneously by 55 public sales offices in the district starting today. Each person will receive 2.35 liters of polished rice, priced at 7.05 yuan. It is also learned that the back of the rice purchase certificate must be filled in with the household's affiliated Baojia district system, and the head of the household must sign and stamp it. If the handwriting is found to be blurred and unclear, the public sales offices will refuse to sell it. It is hoped that all citizens will pay attention.

### Order from the Ministry of Justice to Emphasize Investigation Cases; The Handling Officials Should Personally Attend the Investigation

The Ministry of Justice Administration believes that various courts often perfunctorily handle investigation cases, which is very wrong. In order to effectively rectify this situation, the Ministry, based on the resolutions of the National Judicial Administration Conference, stipulates that investigation cases should be handled by the handling judges themselves. In particular, in cases involving human lives, the handling personnel should be instructed to pay special attention to the investigation when attending the initial investigation, and must not be negligent, causing inconvenience.

### Shen Bao Readers Scholarship Fund Receives Enthusiastic Donations

The Shen Bao Readers Scholarship Fund received generous donations from Tong Kee and Mr. Dong Deyang yesterday, which will be used for scholarships. In addition, the students of the 32nd grade of Xinzhong Middle School, putting themselves in others' shoes, transferred the surplus funds of the grade's scholarship to the Shen Bao scholarship fund. All are extremely valuable. I would like to thank the poor students on their behalf.

Scholarships Received Yesterday

The scholarships received yesterday were: Tong Kee, 4,000 yuan; Dong Deyang, 2,000 yuan (as a celebration gift from relatives and friends for his son's full month, and 310 yuan supplemented by himself, the list of titles is as follows: Ren Shouyu, Chen Zhiqing, Wu Yuncheng, Zhang Xinzhi, Qiu Zhuru, Mrs. Qiu, Shao Qianli, Wu Xianming, Xu Gaoming, Tao Junfei, 100 yuan each; Wu Xianwei, Wang Qiusheng, Xu Xingwei, Zhou Zhuan, Zhou Zhuping, Song Shengchuang, Ma Hongzhang, Yao Qiaosheng, 46.25 yuan each; Chen Yongfu, Sun Jingqian, Zhang Guichang, Hua Dafu, Hong Haiguan, Sun Yingru, Chen Guangfu, Yan Guikang, 40 yuan each; 316 yuan from the 32nd grade of Shanghai Xinzhong Middle School, 12 yuan from Ding Fa, totaling 6,338 yuan in savings certificates, and the balance is 313,284.69 yuan.

### The Tram Company Streamlines Ticketing and Hopes for Passenger Cooperation

The Public Concession Tram Company Bureau, due to recent revenue issues and the fact that the vehicles are crowded in the morning and evening, which can easily lead to dangerous incidents, in order to streamline the company's administration and effectively cooperate with passengers, passengers are encouraged to report rude ticket sellers to the authorities for severe punishment. Yesterday, the Tram Company Bureau also notified all sectors of society that they must obtain tickets of the same value from the ticket sellers when taking the tram. The notice said: "Attention, tram passengers, it is a public principle to pay for a ticket for transportation. However, some passengers only know to pay the fare and do not ask for a ticket. This is not only abandoning their rights, but also losing their personal dignity. If the ticket inspector finds a passenger without a ticket, they must buy a ticket again according to the rules. This is not worth sitting on a tram once and paying twice. If a nosy person sees it, they will think that the passenger deliberately did not buy a ticket and occupied the seat, which is inevitably ridiculed. Moreover, when you ask yourself, you will feel ashamed. Therefore, we especially advise the public that it is the most reasonable and glorious way to buy a ticket of equal value when boarding the bus and paying the fare. We sincerely hope that all passengers will pay special attention to avoid being deceived and to show fairness, which is our great hope."

### Since the Start of the Epidemic Prevention Campaign, Thousands of People are Injected Every Day; The Validity Period of the Epidemic Prevention Certificate is Three Months; There is No Need to Fear Fever After Injection

Since the epidemic prevention injection has been widely implemented, the various health sub-bureaus and special injection points set up by the Baojia have been very crowded in recent days. The roadside injection teams set up by the health authorities at the intersection of each district also advise pedestrians to get injections.

Validity Period of the Epidemic Prevention Certificate. Since the start of the epidemic prevention injection campaign in this port, the total number of people injected every day has averaged several thousand. These people are given epidemic prevention certificates, which are valid for three months. However, it is said that this certificate is absolutely not allowed to be borrowed. If it is found, they will be fined.

No Need to Fear Fever After Injection. The anti-epidemic vaccines used in various hospitals are said to have been checked by the authorities and should not be dangerous in any way. Residents who are injected may develop a slight fever due to physical weakness. According to the explanation, this is not a major problem and there is no need to fear it. In any case, the authorities are determined to have every resident of Shanghai vaccinated against the epidemic this summer to thoroughly prevent the spread of cholera.

Epidemic Prevention Measures in the French Concession. The health authorities of the French Concession said that there have been new improvements in the implementation of epidemic prevention measures in the French Concession this year. Now, various epidemic prevention measures have been decided to ensure that residents can enjoy these measures. For example, sufficient storage of sanitary materials has been prepared. The Pasteur Institute is currently able to supply 1 million CC of vaccine. In addition, a large number of injectors, assistants, and supervisors have begun work.

Compulsory Nature. This epidemic prevention injection is compulsory. Every resident must have an epidemic prevention injection certificate. As for the style of the certificate, it is completely uniform throughout China. A paper will be issued to each person at the time of injection for proof. The certificate states the ID number and is valid for three months, calculated from the date of injection.

Inspection Certificate. For special accommodation, certificates issued by doctors can be exchanged for official certificates, but they must be exchanged in person at the Health Department at 630 Avenue Beler within two days after the injection. The department will carefully check to avoid fraud. If it is found, they will be severely punished.

Number of Injections. If possible, epidemic prevention injections should be given twice, eight days apart, with 1 CC per injection. If it is not possible to give two injections, 2 CC can be given in one injection. The first injection plan for all residents in the French Concession will be completed in May. With the cooperation and inspection of the police station and Baojia authorities, it is believed that the epidemic prevention plan can be satisfactorily implemented.

Injection Location. The locations of the fixed epidemic prevention teams set up in each district are listed below:

Xiaodongmen District: 105 Yangxing Street.

Mailand District: Police Station.

Avenue Joffre District: Baxianqiao Small Vegetable Market, Ximen Road Small Vegetable Market, Police Station, 630 Avenue Beler Health Department.

Central District: 99 Lane 78, Rue du Père Huc, 450 Avenue du Père Froc, entrance of Lane 304, Route Paul Henry.

Avenue Foch District: 840 Avenue des Soeurs Health Branch, Police Station, 201 Route Mercier.

Avenue Petain District: 241 Route Wendling, the International Savings Society Building at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Route Ferguson.

In addition, the Health Department at 620 Avenue Beler and the branch at 840 Avenue des Soeurs are working as usual, and typhoid injections are still being given in the afternoon.

### The Hongkou Naval Garrison Area Changes Baojia Fees to Savings Certificate Standard

The Hongkou Naval Garrison Area Baojia Office originally used military currency as the standard for the Baojia fees collected from each district. In order to comply with the authorities' policy, it has been decided that from the 1st of next month, the Central Reserve Bank notes will be used as the standard. The Baojia fees are set at 6 yuan per month for shops and factories, 3 yuan for landlords with two tenants, and 1 yuan for tenants with three tenants.

### The Opening of Iron Gates in the Nanshi Area Remains to Be Seen

The Nanshi area has always been a prosperous commercial area. After the war, it suffered severely from the ravages of war. Traffic to and from the French Concession was suddenly cut off, and it was extremely inconvenient for pedestrians to enter and exit. Although the iron gates at Laobeimen and other places have been opened since then, the remaining iron gates have not been opened to the public, which has greatly hindered the restoration of Nanshi. It was once rumored that they would be opened to the public on the 1st of next month, but according to a Central News Agency reporter's investigation, the saying that they would be opened to the public on May 1st will not be implemented at that time. However, the relevant authorities have both agreed to the principle of opening to the public.

### The Municipal Baojia Committee Levies Baojia Fees

After the establishment of the Municipal Baojia Committee, in order to unify the Baojia funds in each district, it was decided to readjust them. The fees are 2 yuan per month for attached households, 4 yuan per month for regular households, and 6 yuan per month for shops. These measures have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. It is now learned that the committee has ordered its subordinate district offices and Baojia offices to universally levy the fees starting in April. All original levy methods in each district have been abolished, and each district has been ordered to quickly prepare a budget of income and expenditure for examination.

### The Second Phase of the Rural Clearing Work Convenes and Inspects the Chief of the Question to Give Instructions

The second phase of the rural clearing in this city has already begun. In order to speed up the development of the work, the chief officer of the closure management office of the Qingxiang Branch specially convened the newly appointed chiefs of questions from various districts yesterday to give instructions on various work opportunities, hoping that the chiefs of questions would be law-abiding, not greedy for money, and not disturb the people, and complete the great cause of rural clearing. On the same day, the newly appointed deputy directors of the closure management offices in Chongming, Baoshan, and Jiading were also convened to give instructions on all matters.

Rural Household Registration Regulations. Checking household registration is one of the main tasks of rural clearing. In order to thoroughly check the household registration in the three special districts of Chongming, Jiading, and Baoshan in the rural clearing, the Shanghai Qingxiang Branch specially revised and revised the regulations on organizing Baojia and checking household registration for the purpose of secret organization, including: 1. Provisional Regulations on Organizing Baojia. 2. Implementation Rules for Checking Household Registration in the Second Ming Qingxiang Area (Chong, Jia, Bao). 3. Service Rules for Township Baojia Heads in Qingxiang Area. 4. Provisional Measures for Reporting Changes in Household Registration in Qingxiang Area. 5. Provisional Measures for Managing Self-Renewal Households in Qingxiang Area. 6. Implementation Rules for Checking and Compiling the Household Registration of Boat Households in Qingxiang Area, etc., which were promulgated and implemented.

### Public Concession Police Officers Inspected at the Racecourse Today; Director General Okazaki Awarded Medals of Merit; Relevant Officials from Various Countries Attended the Ceremony

The elite parts of the Public Concession's various district police stations and other auxiliary groups established by the police department will gather at the racecourse at 2:00 p.m. today to hold the annual grand inspection.

After the inspection, Director General Okazaki will award medals to police officers who have served for more than 20 years and have made special contributions. This kind of inspection ceremony was not held last year. It is said that new programs that have never been seen in previous years will be added this time, and there will definitely be a grand occasion at that time.

### The Shanghai Security Command Executed a Bandit

The bandit Zhu Changlin used firearms to rob a youth league rifle, a pistol, and a bicycle, and armed himself with banknotes and other items from Jinqiao Township, Pubei District, at 10:00 p.m. on April 18, 1941, and fled without a trace. On May 16 of the same year, he kidnapped Li Pan and others living in the Li family's house in Yangjiagou, Gaojiahang, and hid them for ransom. The Pubei District Office arrested Zhu Changlin and sent him to the Security Command for strict interrogation. The criminal confessed to the crime. According to the provisions of Article 2, Section 3, and Section 10 of the Provisional Measures for Punishing Bandits, he should be sentenced to death. After being submitted to the Military Commission for approval, he was executed by shooting at the Zhongshan Road execution ground at 1:00 p.m. yesterday (22nd) after verifying his identity.

### Dispersing Coffins Left in Shanghai

### Discussion on the Preservation of Wealth (1)

The Preservation of Wealth by Elder Layman Nie Yuntai is broad, profound, and extremely perfect. It is truly a heart-wrenching article. Recently, he wrote "Report on Public Doctor and Medicine Relief by Xian Leshan," which is especially a good word for correcting the world. Yesterday, I respectfully listened to Mr. Zhang Yili's lecture on "Citizen Welfare" at the Jing'an Temple. The views are the same and I was very moved. Therefore, I would like to extend its meaning without fear of presumptuousness. I hope that the readers will teach me. - Yang Yusheng

What is wealth? Wealth means abundance and surplus. In the past, Yan Fu translated the book "The Wealth of Nations," which cited Western philosophical economic theories and did not refer to the wealth of one person or one family. The explanations of wealth by scholars from various countries are also inconsistent. Ordinary people only refer to tangible wealth, but they do not know that "wealth of talent and learning" and "wealth of compassion" are more important. The concept of wealth is created by individual psychology and social psychology. Whether it is ethical, religious, economic, or artistic, everything determines its value due to changes in demand and supply, and obtains its quantity in the estimation of social balance. Gold and silver coins are just bargaining chips for calculation. Poverty and wealth are comparative names. In wealthy countries, even if they are well-fed and clothed, they cannot be called officials. As in our country, which has been plagued by wars for years, and the people are not well-connected, it is exactly what the Father of the Nation called "only great poverty and small poverty." Even those who are called wealthy may not be truly wealthy.

What is the standard of wealth? Everyone has a selfish heart, and the concept of wealth is unbreakable. They believe that without being an official, without speculating, there is no way to get rich. Without wealth, there is no glory. Without glory, there is no power. This is a vulgar generalization. May I ask what is the standard of wealth? In this difficult time of life, the standard of wealth is also the most difficult to determine: (1) Is it based on money? Money is currency, and its value is constantly changing.

(2) Is it based on goods? In this time of material shortage, hoarding and speculating can indeed lead to great wealth, but it is not allowed by national laws. Moreover, excessive storage leads to theft, which the ancients warned against. Even if it is hidden and kept wealthy, if one does not know how to work diligently in production, then sitting idle and eating what is available is not reliable.

(3) Is it based on life and body? People in the world only recognize the body of flesh and blood as their own, wives and children as their family, gold, jade, and jewelry as their wealth, and greed, delusion, and delusion as their hearts. They take this body and mind as the standard and make plans for thousands of years, so they create all kinds of karma, busy and busy, troubled and troubled, all of which is suffering. They do not know that the body of flesh and blood is a tangible thing and changes are uncertain. Wives and children are family outside the body, and gathering and scattering are inappropriate. Gold, jade, and jewelry are rare treasures that others can steal. Greed, delusion, and delusion are the nature of ignorance, which is even more elusive. Putting it all together, birth and death are impermanent. If we observe the body based on physiology or anatomy and analyze it to the extreme, we will know that the body is not the true self. If we observe family members based on psychology, we will know that individuals exist independently. If we observe the spirit based on psychology, we will know that feelings and emotions are all nothing more than the effects of stimulation and response. Everything is not the true standard of wealth.

Who is rich? How can wealth be preserved? How many rich people have there been in ancient and modern times? Although they were prominent in their lifetime, they only ate three meals a day and slept on one bed. There was no happiness to speak of. Shi Chong's wealth was taken advantage of by slaves and he did not die well. Elephants are burned for their teeth, leopards are tattooed for their patterns. A common man is innocent, but he is guilty of possessing jade. How many people in troubled times have been brought disaster by wealth? Therefore, Lao Tzu said: "Gold and jade fill the hall, but no one can keep them. Being rich and noble is to leave behind faults. Holding and filling them is not as good as stopping." The ancients who became rich through diligence and thrift could still keep it. If it comes from theft and extravagance is admired, its ruin will be even faster. I remember Mr. Ma Yinliang talking about the problem of life in the Shen Bao, saying: "Preserving wealth is not as good as not being wealthy. Being wealthy with the masses can make oneself wealthy." These are indeed the best words that conform to scientific theory.

### Economic Circles: Critique on Weights and Measures in the Price Problem

The Weights and Measures Investigation Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department, in order to crack down on merchants using substandard weights and measures, recently dispatched officers to various districts of the city for thorough investigations. If anyone is found using substandard weights and measures, they will be dealt with according to the following methods: (1) Accusation in court according to criminal law; (2) Interrogation based on the land regulations; (3) Issuance of warnings; (4) Confiscation of the substandard weights and measures. According to a recent announcement from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Intelligence Department, Sun Yu-cai, the vendor of meat stall number 45 at the New Market, was fined 300 yuan and his scales were confiscated for using short weights. Furthermore, the city government yesterday received balances and other instruments from the pre-incident Weights and Measures Verification Bureau of the city for future use.

According to ancient history: "Hebrew and Indian civilizations both had regulations for punishing counterfeit weights and measures, and those who counterfeit weights and measures were considered to be committing the same crime as those who raised market prices for profit." Encountering the counterfeiting and use of substandard weights and measures are both criminal acts of raising prices.

In the Republic of China, during the 18th year, the government authorities, due to the numerous abuses in the system of weights and measures, formulated regulations for weights and measures, using the meter, kilogram, and liter as units, and also using the city foot, city catty, and city peck as parallel units. In the same year, a publicity campaign was held to promote the use of standard weights and measures. We believe that substandard weights and measures should be thoroughly cracked down on. Strict supervision should be imposed on the manufacture of weights and measures, and severe punishments should be imposed on merchants and civilians who use substandard weights and measures, so that our people will not be subjected to increased oppression due to rising prices.

### Vice Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Food Discusses Wartime Food Administration Countermeasures

After the National Government entered the war, recognizing the importance of food in wartime, the Provisional Commission was reorganized into the Ministry of Food, which is responsible for the production, management, and distribution of food throughout the country. Since its establishment, the Ministry has made many efforts in food administration. A reporter from the Central News Agency recently visited Vice Minister Zhou of the Ministry to inquire about (1) the fundamental countermeasures for the food problem during wartime, and (2) the general situation of production control, distribution, and consumption. The Vice Minister provided detailed answers, the main points of which are recorded below:

1.  The fundamental countermeasures for the food problem during wartime are threefold: (A) To increase production to achieve abundant harvests and replenish storage; (B) To strengthen control to ensure supply and demand meet and prices are balanced; (C) To manage consumption to ensure rational allocation and equal enjoyment. These three aspects should be promoted simultaneously and not neglected. 2. As for

Plans to Increase Production, start with the most important materials for military and civilian food needs, such as (1) agricultural products, (2) aquatic products, and (3) livestock products. Various means such as experimentation, promotion, breeding, protection, and loans are used to increase production and improve technology. 3. In all provinces and cities, all food materials should be managed by food merchants, organized into

Trade Associations. Each trade association can be divided into four groups: (1) purchasing merchant group, (2) sales merchant group, (3) retail merchant group, and (4) manufacturing merchant group. Such organization will result in division of labor and cooperation, achieving greater effectiveness. The types of food industry trade associations currently under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Food are listed as follows: 1. Coarse grains industry, 2. Flour industry, 3. Livestock industry, 4. Aquatic products industry, 5. Egg industry, 6. Edible oil industry, 7. Sugar industry, 8. Tea industry, 9. Canned food industry, 10. Brewing industry, 11. Seasoning industry, 12. Vegetable and fruit industry, 13. Other food and beverage industries commonly consumed in daily life. Among the food materials operated by the above industries, the Ministry of Food has presented to the Executive Yuan for approval to designate six major commodities as follows: (1) Coarse grains, (2) Flour, (3) Livestock, (4) Eggs, (5) Sugar, (6) Edible oil. The details will be announced soon. As for

Rice and Grain, whose nature is particularly important, it has always been under the direct management of the government. Before the promulgation of the Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, the Articles of Association for Rice Joint Operation Cooperatives have been formulated, instructing rice merchants in counties and cities within the unified rice procurement area to start organizing joint operation cooperatives. All rice merchants must join; those who do not participate in the joint operation cooperatives may not engage in the rice business. All organizational content and spirit are exactly the same as other food industry trade associations. The differences are: (1) Rice joint operation cooperatives do not need to participate in the Shanghai Silk Federation, while other food major commodity trade associations must participate in the unified control federation; (2) Certificates and permits used by rice joint operation cooperatives are issued by the Ministry of Food, while other food major commodity trade associations may issue their own transportation permit certificates. 4. As for

Management of Consumption Methods, the most thorough way is to hold pin-mouth food distribution, so that everyone has food, and food has a fixed amount, not too much, no waste. All businesses that consume rice and grain, such as brewing and making pastries, should be cracked down on. In short, in today's wartime, the sole mission of the Ministry of Food is to increase production, strengthen management, in order to enrich military needs and stabilize civilian food, and with concerted efforts from top to bottom, the food problem can be hoped to be solved.

### Ministry of Food Urges Organization of Food Associations in Various Places

The Ministry of Food considers trade associations in various places as the grassroots organizations of the National Federation of Commercial Control, as well as the basic components of the Shanghai Federation of Industries. It is imperative to organize and establish them in advance, so that they can be connected and mutually beneficial. Various commodities can also be moved and utilized systematically and orderly, exerting the spirit of self-governance and control of merchants, so that military and civilian food needs can be continuously supplied and there will be no more panic. The Food Bureau of each province and city has been ordered to promptly urge merchants operating food materials in the counties and cities under their jurisdiction to organize trade associations according to the following items and establish them within the time limit. The original methods are transcribed as follows: (1) Major food commodities, such as coarse grains, flour, livestock, eggs, sugar, and edible oil, have been divided into regions by the Ministry, and a group of preparation personnel has been appointed to start preparations. The local food departments should immediately provide guidance and supervision nearby, and organize and establish them all within this month. (2) For the various major commodities listed above, in districts where the Ministry has not appointed preparatory personnel, the local food department should immediately convene influential members of the industry to elect three or five representatives and submit them to the Ministry for appointment as preparatory personnel. At the same time, preparations should be started and organized according to law, and all establishments should be reported before May 5. (3) For other food products, the local food departments should, according to the types managed by the Ministry, and based on the newly promulgated regulations and in consideration of local customs, promptly urge the reorganization of the original associations, and all establishments should be completed before May 15 to facilitate progress.

### The Amount of Cotton Textiles and Medicines Shipped Out of This Port Increased Sharply Last Month

Since the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's office in Shanghai sent personnel on the 16th of last month to take over the material shipping office of the Japanese Embassy, the office was taken over by the National Federation of Commercial Control on the 18th of this month. During this month and two days, the situation of material shipping in and out of this port was as follows: Medicines, cotton textiles (including socks, towels, underwear, etc.), and hardware were the most shipped out materials, while rice and beans were the main shipped in materials. Among the shipped in and out materials, the total value of cotton products was over 7.82 million yuan, of which Chinese merchants shipped out over 3.57 million yuan, and Japanese merchants shipped out over 4.24 million yuan.

Observing these figures, it can be seen that the trade of Chinese merchants has gradually increased in the past month. The types and quantities of materials shipped in and out of this port in March are surveyed as follows:

Shipped out materials: Medicines 3,152,000 yuan, dyes 324,000 yuan, cotton textiles 7,822,000 yuan, matches 282,000 yuan, soap 229,000 yuan, kerosene 975,000 yuan, machinery 769,000 yuan, metal products 2,729,000 yuan, rubber products 235,000 yuan.

Shipped in materials: Rice 8 million city catties, 14 million yuan; flour 20,960 bags, 1.91 million yuan; beans 6,247,000 city catties, 13,583,000 yuan.

The regions to which the above-mentioned shipped out materials were transported were Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Wuhu, Bengbu, and Hangzhou. Nanjing imported the most rice. The Shanghai suburban Qingxiang area and Hangzhou, Nanjing, and northern Jiangsu imported the most beans.

### Ministry of Food Sends Personnel to Investigate Egg Merchant Joint Operation Cooperative

Regarding the organization of the Shanghai Egg Industry Trade Association, the Ministry of Food has ordered Shanghai egg merchant Zheng Yuanxing and others to be the preparatory personnel for the industry trade association, responsible for preparing and organizing. Recently, the Ministry of Food received a report that Dai Hongliang claimed to have organized an egg merchant joint operation cooperative according to the regulations of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. This should be a pretense or have other intentions, and Dong Zhikai, an assistant of the Management Department, has been ordered to go to investigate.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Stipulates Fee Rates for Yarn and Cloth Transportation Permits

The Shanghai Municipal Council Intelligence Department announced: Regarding the matter of applying for permits from the Bureau for the transportation of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, it has been announced in Announcement No. 6327 on the 16th of this month. Now, the fees for these permits and the amount of security deposits to be paid by the applicants have been stipulated as follows:

1.  Permit fee: 5 yuan per piece, regardless of the quantity of cotton yarn or cotton cloth.

2.  Security deposit: 40 yuan per 100 pounds of cotton yarn, 15 yuan per bolt of cotton cloth.

### Taxes Levied on Tobacco and Alcohol Based on Value, Prices of Various Alcohols Already Estimated

The Jiangsu Province Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, in accordance with the decision of the Supreme National Defense Council of the National Government, levied a tax of 25% on alcohol based on its value. The prices of various types of alcohol were estimated, with Shaoxing wine at 400 yuan per load, imitation Shaoxing wine at 240 yuan per load, local yellow wine at 180 yuan per load, colored wine at 1,000 yuan per load, and local white liquor at 500 yuan per load. All alcohol guilds were ordered to instruct their members to comply with the tax payment. However, the Liang Shao Industry Guild believed that the estimated price of local white liquor was too high to comply with, so they requested assistance and changes from the competent authorities such as the Jiangsu Province Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, and sent representatives to petition. The Taxation Department approved the order, instructing the industry guild to report the cost and selling price of the place of origin in detail to the department for investigation and verification before making a final decision. The industry guild has reported the facts and is awaiting verification.

### Reader Forum: Thorough Solutions to the Price Problem (1)

— Miao Zhonghui

The "price problem" in Shanghai has become a national economic problem. After the war, most of the factories in the interior have been shut down, and all daily necessities must rely on Shanghai's exports. Therefore, the rise in prices in Shanghai directly affects the prices nationwide. Rising prices are equivalent to the invisible devaluation of banknotes. People throw out all the money they have and exchange it for useful items. This reveals a distrust of the currency. As a result of the entire society searching for materials, prices are further increased. The public's panic about prices can lead to the collapse of the currency system and the bankruptcy of the national economy. This vicious cycle of rising prices has three factors: First, the impact of material shortages; Second, the result of inflation; Third, the formation of market manipulation and hoarding.

It is not necessarily correct to consider the lack of materials as the cause, because materials during wartime are certainly not as abundant as during peacetime, and rising prices are an unavoidable phenomenon. However, rising prices due to this reason will be in the form of a gradual increase, because it is due to the gradual consumption of material reserves. The current jumping state of Shanghai's prices cannot be encompassed by the simple reason of material shortages. If inflation is considered the cause of rising prices, then it should also be gradual, not rapid and sudden. Moreover, with the increase in the area of the peaceful district, the increase in tax revenue, and the expansion of the circulation area of the Central Reserve Bank notes, it cannot be regarded as the main culprit causing rising prices. Therefore, speculative hoarding is actually the biggest main cause.

The government has the determination to eradicate hoarders, which is not only what the people are looking forward to, but also what friendly countries are paying attention to. However, the fact that we cannot completely break away from old habits is undeniable. The background of the so-called "big tigers" is causing much discussion in society, with clear details. For the sake of the survival of the entire nation, the government must urgently use its enormous political power and be willing to make the greatest sacrifices to thoroughly investigate in order to maintain the survival of the nation. The public generally believes that the "Thorough Investigation of Speculation Order" issued by the National Government on April 7 is "mere formalities." In order to eliminate such a public perception, the government should urgently promulgate "Provisional Emergency Regulations for Cracking Down on Speculation and Hoarding." It may be prosecuted for disturbing the state and executed by a military court. Now, to the best of my humble opinion, I propose the following three methods:

(1) Thoroughly investigate speculative hoarding: First, the reckless lending of the financial sector in the past, or the use of goods as collateral, has in fact resulted in inflation. Therefore, this soft hoarding is enough to stimulate rising prices. In the past two or three years, the establishment of Shanghai banks has been like bamboo shoots after rain. Investigating their predecessors, most of them were small money shops, and their business was only speculation or improper lending. If the existence of such banks is confirmed, they should be sealed up immediately, and their operators should be severely punished according to the severity of their crimes.

(2) Second, freezing warehouses is also the most effective method. For any goods in any warehouse, it is not allowed to be moved in or out. The purpose of the owner's inventory should be quickly investigated. If there is suspicion of hoarding, they should be arrested and the goods confiscated. (3) Third, investigate stores. Stores refusing to sell is a strange phenomenon in recent years. The hoarding of stores of all sizes in the city is also a cause of high prices, and it directly stimulates the public's panic. It is appropriate to task agencies such as the Commercial Control Association with investigating inventory and whether stores refuse to sell goods, and to allow the public to secretly report. In the event of the above situation, in addition to closing the store, the store owner, guarantor, and association负责人 should all be handed over to the court for severe punishment. (4) Fourth, task the section chiefs of each district with investigating and reporting hoarders in their jurisdiction within a time limit. If there are rental houses for hoarding or speculation, they should be dealt with according to the law. If the section chiefs conceal and fail to report, they should be punished for the same crime. (5) Fifth, reward the public for secretly reporting. (6) Sixth, organize secret investigation teams to randomly check stores and hoarders reported by the people. - The implementation of the above six investigation methods still needs to be studied for its steps and detailed methods. In short, it should not exceed the principle of political means.

### Three Metaphors of Life

— Zhang Xin

There are three metaphors for life:

The first metaphor is the ocean: the ocean has times of calm and tranquility, and times of stormy waves. In calm times, the so-called vastness of the sea and sky, sailboats, distant mountains, and seagulls, adorn a beautiful seascape. In stormy waves, however, the sky is dark and the earth is dark, and strong winds, heavy rain, and thick fog envelop the entire universe. However, it is necessary to have stormy waves to know how rare the calm and tranquility is. If it is always calm and tranquil, it may make people feel tired of seeing it, and feel ordinary and monotonous! At the same time, in the roaring waves, the sea will make a roaring sound that shakes the earth, and stir up active silvery white waves, which shows the sea's majesty and greatness.

The second metaphor is the river: the river carries a clean quality, flowing continuously and peacefully, calmly and steadily, only advancing, not retreating. The mountains cannot stop it, the rocky mountains cannot resist it, and the wind cannot turn it around. Finally, one day, it reaches its destination - the ocean.

The third metaphor is the pond: the pond carries an old quality, permanently stagnant. The occasional movement by wind and rain is only a thin layer on the surface. Its entirety will never move forward one step, so the inside is only turbid and dirty, and microorganisms also take advantage of it to reside, causing it to become rotten.

The first kind of life is the most valuable, the second kind of life is the most vigorous, and the third kind of life is the most unpromising.

### Profit

— Sha Lei

The world is bustling, all for "profit"; the world is noisy, all for "profit."

"Profit" itself has no good or evil. Legal "profit" is even stipulated by law, and there is nothing to criticize.

However, Mencius, at the beginning of his book, strongly criticized the evils of loving "profit." Where "profit" lies, the masses flock like ducks. Seeing "profit" and forgetting righteousness, what care is given to faith; seeking "profit" and betraying virtue, what consideration is given to benevolence. Therefore, there is no righteousness, no faith, no virtue, no benevolence, hypocrisy, cunning, mutual deception, what the eyes see is "profit"; what the ears hear is "profit"; what the feet walk is for "profit"; what the hands move is for "profit"; what the mind thinks is nothing but "profit." Hoarding, accumulating, monopolizing, blackmailing, exploiting, creating rumors and causing trouble, stirring up trouble, only to seek one's own "profit," regardless of the hunger and cold of tens of thousands of people!

The ancient saying goes, "Silver is white and gold is yellow, the eyes see the heart turn black." Today's banknotes, however, are colorful, and the heart flutters when you see them. Once the desire for "profit" overwhelms the mind, "profit" also makes the mind lose its way. Therefore, unscrupulous means are used, and no consideration is given to morality.

If the path of material desire is not blocked, how can the door of morality be opened? As Plato said, "Material needs are the evil obstacles that hinder the soul's ascent," and the original culprit is intoxicated in the path of "profit" and loses direction.

### True and False

— Meng Lin

If a midget is standing on the tip of a pyramid, can you say he is higher than the pyramid? No, he will still be called a midget! But there are so many fools in the world. It is impossible for ten people to escape hiding their vices. Because if you walk with the sun on your back, your shadow is always in front of you, unless you walk facing the sun, and your shadow will be behind you.

Therefore, whether in life or in career, we should "seek the true, not the false, and be realistic in everything." You should know that our daily character, thoughts, life, ... are already known to others. Even if we can cover up stains for a while, they will eventually be revealed sooner or later. When each stain enters our heart, it leaves a deep mark on our character that cannot be erased for a lifetime. It was his disciple Judas who betrayed Jesus. Although he didn't know it at first, as soon as he managed a purse of thirty dollars, he immediately revealed his treacherousness in selling his master. Later, he was hanged, but he could not atone for his sins.

Hartland said, "Character is a person's inner self, and reputation is a person's appearance." It is absolutely true. One act leads to one consequence. There is absolutely no falsehood, only absolute truth.

In the afternoon chapel, people often piously pray, "Even if the treasures of the whole world were given to me, I would not covet them, because we have a pure heart, which is the greatest wealth." But when they are donating, they are groping for the lowest value banknotes... Is there still a need to deny it? Truth and falsehood are immediately revealed.

Whether it is "true" or "false," it cannot deceive others, nor can it deceive oneself.

### View on Life and Death

— Le Ming

A passage from Mr. Gu Zhengshu's speech "The Struggle Between Life and Death" at the Youth Association

Every person has one birth and one death. No matter how much he loves life, he cannot live forever; no matter how afraid he is of death, he cannot avoid death.

Some people shock their neighbors when they are born, but die without a trace. Some people are unknown when they are born, but revered by thousands when they die.

A person's view of life and death can determine his attitude and way of life. One person feels that life is only a few decades, passing in the blink of an eye, so why work so hard? Another person believes that although life is inevitable to die, but "Heaven gives me talent, there must be a use." Since the Creator has created me, I must live a good life.

Look, people in today's society are either "living in a drunken dream" or "greedy for life and afraid of death," either "half-dead" or "not alive or dead." They euphemistically call it "prudent self-preservation." In my opinion, these (people) are really "although alive, they are already dead," or simply "it is better to be dead than alive"!

Life is loved by everyone, and death is hated by everyone. However, on the path of life and death, there are no clear signs for us to identify. Some paths we think are dead ends but are actually paths to life. Some paths we think are paths to life but are actually paths to death!

Life is surrounded by death, and death is also full of life. Friends, be careful of your steps! Don't only see death and not see life, and don't only see life and not see death!

### Dissatisfaction and Lack of Contentment

— Bu Ren

One desire follows another, and young people will never feel satisfied. This feeling of dissatisfaction is the driving force for continuous human progress. The wheels of the world's advancement are driven by the feeling of dissatisfaction, and all the improvements in human life are also caused by the feeling of dissatisfaction.

However, every feeling of dissatisfaction must have its social roots in reality. Society is not composed of just you. When you feel dissatisfied with a certain aspect, you can imagine that a larger group of people also have the same feeling. Therefore, when you satisfy your desires, you should carefully consider your means. Selfishly seizing the only thing others have to fill your own insatiable desires, then you should be cursed by the world. And you have also sullied the good human feeling of dissatisfaction.

You do not have the intelligence to satisfy your desires, and you do not understand the social roots of why your desires cannot be satisfied. You blindly and selfishly seize the possessions of others to satisfy yourself, then you become a rude and vile person who lacks contentment. Lack of contentment is the opposite of dissatisfaction. It is despised by people because it often causes you to disregard the interests of others, disrupt society, and at the same time fall into sin and injustice and be cursed by society.

Dissatisfaction is worthy of praise, while lack of contentment should be cursed; conversely, a state of contentment is what we should not want, and contentment is the virtue that we should take.

We should have a psychology of contentment for a temporary enjoyment in one's life. We should have an attitude of never being satisfied with our knowledge and intelligence; only in this way can we have something to rely on, gradually enriching our means of improving the environment, gradually understanding and eradicating the social roots that make us feel dissatisfied, and thus seeking to satisfy all our spiritual dissatisfactions, and even all our material dissatisfactions.

### Two Symptoms: Bloating and Anemia

— Tian Mingzuo

### Re-discussing the Environment

— Yuan Jie

Mencius said, "When Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on a person, it always first frustrates their heart and will, exhausts their muscles and bones, starves their body, impoverishes them, and disrupts their endeavors..." This passage needs much revision.

"Heaven"! "God"! These kinds of things are very vague. Saying that the fate of humanity is determined by the will of vague things is hard to believe. It would be better to say, "Some people who suffer and are tempered can shoulder great responsibilities." That would be more appropriate.

But this is not to say that all who suffer can shoulder great responsibilities. Some who are fortunate enough to survive their suffering become numb! Or indulge in pleasure! And the more they indulge, the more they suffer, eventually falling into an inextricable quagmire, struggling throughout their lives, ultimately unable to avoid destruction.

Nor is it to say that those who can shoulder great responsibilities must have suffered. As long as they receive a good education, why must they suffer? To this day, the center of culture is still the petty bourgeoisie. Only the petty bourgeoisie is most likely to have the time and energy to study science and art, and to do cultural work.

It is to say that some people, although they suffer (or have suffered), can still transcend mediocrity, shoulder great responsibilities, and achieve great things.

This is because, although they suffer, they still have considerable opportunities for development. They must have the opportunity to receive a good education. On one hand, they grit their teeth and live a hard, arduous, and extraordinary life; on the other hand, their lives have something to rely on. They are not bewildered, not depressed, and not like a bereaved person. With a strong interest, they work hard towards a self-determined and firm goal. And they have a devout and sincere faith in the great and beautiful things, and in the progress of their own efforts.

Gorky did hard labor, but three or four friends trained him to have a habit of only reading books, replacing all other entertainment in his spare time. At the age of nineteen, he once felt depressed and attempted suicide, but he was rescued. Later, a friend forced him to write, and since then, he escaped the life of hard labor.

Einstein studied mathematics with all his might in his youth. Apart from mathematics and physics, his other subjects were a mess (but he later dabbled in philosophy, biology, and literature). Later, his family went bankrupt, and he had no choice but to go to Switzerland, receiving a monthly allowance of one hundred francs, using eighty francs for living expenses. Although his nutrition was insufficient, he was fortunately able to devote all his time to studying at the university.

Faraday (the founder of electricity) was a bookbinding apprentice in his childhood. The boss agreed to him reading books in the shop. Later, with the help of his brother, he went to the Royal Academy every week to listen to lectures, taking complete notes. Later, he recommended himself to the academy as a servant and assistant, and was able to devote his life to science.

These great men who struggled out of suffering, although they suffered, still had considerable opportunities for development. Their scope of freedom was small. Precisely because it was small, they were cautious and did not dare to be distracted and dabble in various enjoyments. They were able to concentrate wholeheartedly on their work within their scope of freedom, without any distractions. The environment forced them to get rid of the constraints outside their scope of freedom and grasp the highly developed work within their scope of freedom. Their spirits could sometimes obtain the joy that others could not obtain, even ecstasy. Their self-education was extremely good.

Unfortunately, some of them suffered too much! Einstein suffered from poor nutrition in his youth and later suffered from stomach problems. Gorky suffered from severe frostbite in his youth, which aggravated his lung disease, and eventually died of lung disease. Is this the suffering that is necessary for creation? This is such a regrettable thing!

Although material affluence is not necessarily a "good and beautiful environment," if they have not received a good education, some people will become playboys, spoiled brats, high-class hooligans, and living treasures! But scholars who struggle out of difficult environments, escaping death and finding life, already possess a tenacious quality. They can devote themselves to improving the environment, and they most need an environment suitable for fully studying knowledge. Material hardship should be rejected. They need to have their families' food, clothing, and housing fully guaranteed, without having to worry about it at all. They need a peaceful and tranquil environment to study knowledge. Who says that a few toothpicks and a few glass tubes can replace a fully equipped laboratory?

In short: The quality of the environment depends on both economics and education, with economics as the foundation.

### An Earnest Appeal from a Mother: Willing to Nurture Her Family with the Proceeds of Labor

We recently received a letter from Ms. He, stating that her husband is disabled and does not produce, and her children are young and receiving education. The family has no fixed property, and life is difficult. She plans to earn a living through labor. Ms. He is educated and wrote the letter herself, with sincere words and emotions. It is especially commendable that she stated that she refuses all material assistance. Therefore, we will transcribe the original letter, hoping that sympathetic people in society will help find a way. This office can help notify. The original letter is as follows: "I am forty-two years old this year, have received education, and have three children, the eldest son is ten years old, the second daughter is nine years old, and the youngest daughter is eight years old. They are currently studying in the fifth, fourth, and first grades of elementary school, respectively. My husband is also an intellectual, but unfortunately became mentally disabled four years ago. Not only is he unable to produce or labor, but he also needs to spend a lot of money on medicine at any time. My family's finances were already stretched before the war, and we have no fixed property. In this狂潮 of soaring material prices, we have fallen into an unimaginable situation. Regarding节流, I have been personally operating for several years, reducing the necessities of daily life to below the level, insufficient nutrition and excessive fatigue, so I often develop morbid states, I have no way, I have to work hard. However, for a family of five, no matter how you save on medical education, the minimum is still about 1,000 yuan per month to maintain,竭力starting from the开源方面. Years of effort鬭, want to operate a small store to solve the problem of life, from July last year to the present,踏破铁鞋, the location is difficult to find, the large transfer fee is too large, the small one does not rent without friendship, as for other businesses, although there have been several plans, implementation, no achievement. One of the most difficult things is family operation, which takes up most of the time. If someone is hired as an agent, there will be one more person to spend. Originally, there are many kinds of jobs that are suitable for me, but no one introduces them, and the biggest main problem is whether the income of such jobs can meet the needs of my life burden. The environment is getting worse and worse, some people advised me to send a few children into charitable shelters, but I think I still have a strong body and a healthy brain, I should use my own labor to make my children survive, and give him and her the opportunity to continue to learn. Before my life ends, why increase the burden on society! Statistics currently all even clothing utensils priced, but 2,000 yuan, if still no way to develop, at most maintain two months, follow看 my several children's lives, followed by the capital decreased day by day ah! I'm really going crazy? I have decided to make persistent efforts, using this small amount of thousands of yuan of capital, plus all my labor, to make a final struggle, but I have been exhausted智尽能索, for this life of funds, must not blindly bet孤注一掷, I think there is no lack of sympathy for a mother in society, for her children垂死的 call. My hope is to guide me to an effective way of making profits? If there is a need to inquire about my environment and skills, you can also make a statement in person. No matter how difficult and繁重 the work is, I am willing. But refuse all material assistance."
