### The Rights and Wrongs of Politics and the Expression of Public Opinion

— Chen Fumu

In recent years, government authorities have seemed reluctant to accept public criticism of politics, so we often hear the phrase "politics knows no right or wrong." They believe that since politics has no right or wrong, they can do as they please, regardless of whether people criticize them. But don't misunderstand, the phrase "politics knows no right or wrong" is not a universal principle applicable in all situations. It is absolutely not applicable to ordinary political measures.

It is only applicable in situations of dramatic historical change. In those situations, all old systems are being eliminated, and all social values are being re-evaluated. In such situations of negating everything and creating everything, politics naturally has no right or wrong. But such situations are rare. In the last two centuries, the only ones that qualify are the French Revolution of 1789 and the Russian Revolution of 1917.

Apart from the revolutionary situations of historical upheaval, politics is not without right and wrong. Practical politics focuses on facts and efficiency. Therefore, the correctness of a policy can be determined by the results after its implementation, and also by its impact on society during its implementation. Although it may be difficult to predict the results, the public's reaction is not difficult to gauge. Therefore, the judgment of right and wrong, if sought from the direction of public sentiment, can be considered half-successful. In simple terms, taking the direction of public sentiment as a guide is the formula for politics.

Politics is always inseparable from the people, and the main purpose of politics is always to seek the welfare of the people. For this reason, those in power should always pay attention to the immediate interests of the people, and they should listen to the people's political opinions. Otherwise, on what basis can politics be improved? Otherwise, politics will become detached from the people, and the people will become detached from the government. In this way, how can the people and the government become one? And from where can the government obtain genuine power? I recall that in the years of the Republic, 14 and 15, when the National Government was still in Guangzhou and had not yet launched the Northern Expedition, the people of Guangzhou could openly criticize the government in newspapers at any time. As long as the criticism was correct, the government would propose improvements at the Central Political Conference based on public opinion. At that time, the government followed the people, and did not believe that accepting public criticism and reforming government facilities would "undermine the government's prestige." For this reason, the people at that time were indeed one with the government, and the government did indeed receive the enthusiastic support of the people. Relying on this foundation, it was no accident that the National Government was able to promote the National Revolution from a corner of Guangdong in an environment of extreme difficulty. Unfortunately, this vibrant era was only a flash in the pan! Later, although military success was achieved, politics became increasingly dark, and a system of censorship was adopted to tighten the control of people's speech.

I personally hold a skeptical attitude towards the recent news censorship system. I believe that the proper function of news censorship should only be (1) to prevent speech that maliciously opposes the fundamental policies of the government; (2) to prevent the leakage of military secrets; and (3) to prevent the incitement of social unrest through unfounded rumors. Apart from these, social figures should be given considerable freedom of speech. For example, "Sino-Japanese peace" is the fundamental policy of the government and cannot be opposed, but this does not mean that the theories advocating Sino-Japanese peace must be identical in every formulaic article. Under the major premise of Sino-Japanese peace, people should be allowed to express all kinds of different opinions to their hearts' content. Because the more a problem is discussed, the closer it gets to reality. In political affairs, "a blind man riding a blind horse, approaching a deep pool in the middle of the night" is dangerous enough, and it is even more dangerous to plug one's ears and pretend to be deaf, not listening to the warnings of others. Therefore, even the autocratic emperors of ancient times, although they ruled the world as their family's, still kept several upright and outspoken officials by their side, constantly pointing out their flaws, offering loyal advice, and guiding the ruler to implement benevolent governance. We see in history that the more outspoken officials there are in each dynasty, the more enlightened the politics, and the more prosperous the country. In modern countries, there are parliaments, and public opinion can sometimes be conveyed to the government through parliament. Now China does not yet have a parliament, nor does it have old masters or censors. If even newspapers are limited to only writing formulaic essays and eulogies of virtue, where are the government's eyes and ears? Is there still hope for political improvement?

I believe that the time to change this consistent style should be now. Since January 9th, the government's tasks have become heavier. Since January 9th, the government has entered a stage of life and death with the Allied nations. What exactly does the government rely on to live and die with the Allied nations? Of course, it relies on the power of the people. Since the people are required to put forth their strength to live and die together, at the very least, the spirit of the National Government in Guangzhou in the years of the Republic 14 and 15, when it was one with the people, must be encouraged again. At the very least, the clear atmosphere of that era must be restored. At the very least, people must be allowed to speak truthfully about politics as they did in the past. Only by allowing the people to speak can there be clear public opinion in society, can officials be supervised by society, can politics be enlightened, and can the people be willing to actively cooperate with the government. Only by obtaining the active cooperation of the people can the government have genuine power. But the only condition for obtaining the active cooperation of the people is to allow the people to speak on politics—to allow the people to make truthful criticisms of politics.

Furthermore, I also believe that the government's current policy on mass movements should be changed. Mass movements, as the name implies, should be initiated by the masses themselves. But the current mass movements are "government-run," which need not be concealed. I believe that the change that should be made at the present time, at the very least, should be to "government-supervised, privately-run," on the one hand publicizing the government's policies, and on the other hand representing the interests of the masses, standing on the side of the masses, and representing the interests of the masses. If it is impossible to represent the masses in speaking, then mass movements fundamentally lose their meaning. And those who are engaged in mass movements have simply become tools for the government to raise and fool the masses. If public opinion cannot reach the top, then politics will become increasingly dark. If politics is dark, then the masses will become increasingly alienated, and politics will become even darker, going to extremes, and riots will follow.

Recently, I have frequently heard the slogan "National Revolution sets out again." If it is "the way things are now," the masses will definitely not be as enthusiastic as they were the last time they set out. I will not hide the fact that the masses need not be mentioned, even the intellectual class is now indifferent. Therefore, some people have recently been blaming the intellectual class for not being willing to come out and cooperate. I believe that this blame is too harsh. "The way things are now," what methods do intellectuals have and what opportunities do they have to cooperate? The cooperation of intellectuals is to use their thoughts and opinions to lead the masses to cooperate. Now that there is not even an opportunity to express thoughts and opinions, what cooperation can be said to exist? If the current style is not changed, and intellectuals are to be asked to cooperate, then only those intellectuals who, as Xunzi said, "enter their ears and come out of their mouths, only four inches between the ear and the mouth," those with "four-inch learning" are qualified to come out and cooperate. Some time ago, Mr. Yoshida Toyu had an article on "The Fence-Sitting of the Chinese Intellectual Class." Why has the Chinese intellectual class become fence-sitters? I believe that the most precious mouth of the intellectual class is the best explanation, because it is useless in this era. In fact, it is already very good that the intellectual class is fence-sitting. If that intellectual does not have a considerable understanding of the Sino-Japanese problem, he will never put one foot on this side. As for how the other foot is, it depends on the degree of political enlightenment, and whether their mouths and brains can fulfill their due obligations.

Finally, I want to repeat: politics is not without right and wrong. What the common people think is right is right, and what they think is wrong is wrong. Good and evil, right and wrong, are determined by the direction of the common people.

### Finance Minister Zhou Talks to Japanese Reporters About Economic and Financial Measures; Decides to Be Cautious on the Issuance of Central Reserve Certificates; Implements Barter Trade Between Central China and North China

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) — A reporter from the Japanese Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun visited Zhou Fohai, Minister of Finance and Governor of the Central Reserve Bank of our country, and raised many questions concerning economic issues. Minister Zhou provided very detailed answers. The main points are recorded below: The biggest problem in China's wartime economy at present is the price issue. The most important solution is to increase production. Hoarding materials will cause prices to rise. Therefore, the authorities have decided to crack down on hoarding, which should stabilize prices, and have organized a Materials Investigation Committee to investigate hoarding incidents and punish hoarders. Regarding the problem of increasing production, the main difficulties at present are the issues of raw materials and power. Among them, the lack of coal production, which is the source of power, is the biggest problem. In the future, we will actively try to transport coal in. Regarding the issue of raising raw materials, we are currently studying various countermeasures. Regarding the operating policies for enemy properties returned by the Japanese side in the future, because they are related to the issue of increasing production, we plan to adopt three basic policies to manage them carefully. These are (1) sale, (2) entrusted operation, and (3) lease. As for Chinese investment in merged companies, it has essentially become a total investment. However, when these companies are returned to the National Government for management, the authorities also welcome private investment and accept assistance from the general public and influential figures to prepare for it. The issue of smaller banks is related to prices. Therefore, we have revised the previous banking law. The policy is that if the original capital of each bank was 500,000 yuan, it is prohibited from operating now if it cannot be increased to 3 million yuan. Regarding the policy of absorbing public capital, we plan to restore the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which has been operating since the incident. Preparations are currently underway. As for the issue of setting a maximum issuance amount for Central Reserve Certificates, this was discussed when the Central Reserve Bank was established. However, because there are many difficulties in implementation, the maximum issuance amount for Central Reserve Certificates is not specified. However, this does not mean that Central Reserve Certificates will be issued arbitrarily. We will definitely be cautious about the issuance of Central Reserve Certificates. Regarding trade between Central China and North China, we will implement a barter system. The quantities have already been determined and are currently being implemented. As for the current financial situation of the National Government, it is very sound. There has never been a phenomenon of expenditure exceeding income. The issue of increasing taxes is also currently under consideration. The authorities' policy is to ensure that the increase in taxes does not affect prices. However, in terms of China's tax revenue, only the income tax belongs to direct taxes. Therefore, indirect taxes may be increased, but the tax increase will definitely not be too high. Regarding the current local financial problems, the main revenue is land tax, which will be rectified in the future to increase revenue. There is also business tax, but the performance is currently poor, so we are urging relevant parties to actively rectify it. In addition, we are currently not considering issuing public bonds.

### Guangdong Provincial Government Formulates Regulations on the Movement of Materials

Guangzhou, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) — After the central government promulgated the Provisional Regulations for the Prohibition of Wartime Material Movement, this province abolished the Material Allocation Committee and established the Provincial Economic Bureau in May of this year, and formulated the Guangdong Province Provisional Regulations for the Prohibition of Wartime Material Movement, which were promulgated and implemented.

### Hu Zongnan and Others Confer on Military Sanctions Against Communist Troops

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) — From the perspective of foreign relations, the Chongqing side's demand to the CCP to disband the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Red Regime and the garrisoned CCP troops can show the retreat of Soviet power in China's northwest border region. From the perspective of domestic affairs, it is Jiang in Chongqing who intends to strengthen the dictatorship, and does not allow the CCP's current situation in the border region to be tolerated. Therefore, the Three People's Principles Youth League, the driving force behind the Chongqing side's unification movement, is launching a fierce struggle with the CCP in political, social, and cultural aspects. The conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party over the past six years has already entered the stage of military resolution. If the CCP's political compromise, such as the Yan'an side not liquidating its international nature, turning to national centralism, and changing its diplomatic, cultural, and economic policies that have never been based on communism, then the opposition and struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in various aspects will continue to occur. From a military perspective, if the "CCP Central Department" does not accommodate the "National Defense Supreme Committee's" military unification requirements, then the large troops of the "Chongqing Central Army" stationed in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region will cause other war zones to be in crisis, which cannot be tolerated. This kind of situation, where the Communist army shakes up the Chongqing army's rear and ignores the troop establishment stipulated by the Chongqing "National Defense Supreme Committee," arbitrarily increasing its strength to 500,000, and the result of the subsequent increase is estimated to be more than 1.2 million, but less than one-third of them are going to the front line to fight, and the rest are entrenched in the safe rear to cultivate strength. Hu Zongnan and other military and political cadres in northwestern Chongqing held a military meeting in Xi'an on the 10th of this month, and strongly advocated implementing thorough military sanctions against the "Eighteenth Group Army" to eliminate the root of the trouble.

### U.S. Air Force in Chongqing Faces Difficulties

Guangzhou, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) — According to news from Chongqing, Colonel Hisset of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing revealed the unfavorable situation of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing when he met with a United Press reporter on the 14th. The main points of his conversation are recorded as follows: The composition of all the aircraft under the command of Brigadier General Chennault only recently reached a ratio of one bomber to three fighters. The current strength can only maintain a defensive posture, so we are more distressed than any other air squadron in the world. Due to the unstable climate in China, there are many dangers when navigating, and there are no complete flight maps, so its actions are rarely efficient. Also, because of the lack of personnel, these only flight officers have to run around all day long, and the hard work is really unimaginable to people in their home country. The most disappointing thing for us is that there are no bases on the east coast of China. As a result, no matter what sacrifices we make when bombing enemy planes, it will be ineffective and we cannot give the Japanese army a big blow. Therefore, if we do not secure bases on the east coast of China, our current efforts are meaningless. We also don't know why we are engaged in such dangerous work.

### Comprehensive Results of the Japanese Army in Hebei for Half a Year

### Active in the Position of Rural Construction - A Visit to the Capital's Jiancun Agricultural College

— Jing Yuan

Under the slogan of revitalizing the countryside and increasing food production, many people's eyes are focused on agriculture. Of course, today's Chinese countryside is backward and dilapidated. To make it shoulder the task of food supply in the system of total war participation, it is necessary to put in sincere effort and use all efforts in the work of rural construction.

Before the Incident, Zou Ping in Shandong, Ding County in Hebei, and Xu Gongqiao in Jiangsu all had agricultural construction experiments. After the war, the Chinese Youth Labor Corps replaced them in Nanjing.

The Chinese Youth Labor Corps has its main work divided into three parts: one is to train cadre talents engaged in rural construction, the second is to experiment with various systems of rural construction, and the third is to study various technologies for agricultural improvement. Jiancun Agricultural College is an institution engaged in the first type of work.

Jiancun Agricultural College is located in Embroidery Lane, Nanjing. The surrounding hundred acres of open space are the ruins of Li Xianggou's Garden. Now they have all been opened up by the college as a flower specimen area and a test area, so the flowers and trees are lush and the vegetables are full of gardens, which is quite pastoral. The college buildings are rebuilt from civilian houses, with more than 100 rooms. In addition to offices, classrooms, bedrooms, halls, dining rooms, etc., various laboratories, farm tool rooms, seed rooms, insect breeding rooms, agricultural product manufacturing rooms, warehouses, livestock houses, etc. occupy a large area. In terms of equipment, the college has spent more than 3.52 million yuan over the years, so it can be said to be quite complete.

In terms of organization, it is the same as the general agricultural college, divided into six departments: crops, horticulture, animal husbandry, forestry, agricultural education, and sericulture. Because of equipment, the three departments of crops, horticulture, and agricultural education are now set up first. There are a total of 120 students. This semester is preparing to recruit 50 new students.

What is special is the training method created by the college. The college advocates work-study education, and takes the classroom, laboratory, farm, and rural four-in-one as the slogan. Except for a very few abstract subjects, all subjects have more and better experimental time than class time. Students who only understand theory but do not know how to experiment cannot get a passing score in the subject. After 5:00 PM every day, all the students have to walk out of the classroom and go to the farm. Wearing farm clothes, with bare heads and feet, their dark skin and large palms can no longer see the appearance of college students. The nearly 100 acres of farm near the college, as well as the various routine work of the more than a dozen dairy cows, five or six dairy goats, more than 200 Angora rabbits, more than 30 pigs, and hundreds of chickens, geese, ducks, etc. in the attached pasture, are all borne by all the students. Reclamation, plowing, fertilization, sowing, intertillage, pest control, disease prevention, harvesting, grinding, pruning, feeding, grazing, mating, milking, disinfection, milk delivery, etc., each student takes turns to take on. At the same time, in addition to farm service, the operations in the college, such as cleaning, cooking, serving, writing, etc., are not done by others. Therefore, the college has fewer workers and staff than the average agency.

Whether familiarity with agricultural technology can guarantee that students will go to serve in the countryside in the future is still a problem. Because the college is located in the city, students have no contact with the real countryside, and the result is still alienation and cannot adapt. Therefore, the college specifically divides one semester in the entire training period, called rural life practice. Students are asked to live in the Xiaoxing Mountain Model Rural Experimental Area established by the Labor Corps, live and live with the farmers, and truly experience the actual situation of the countryside.

In addition, the college has another feature, which is that it does not have holidays all year round, but it does not have winter and summer vacations, not even a week. On the one hand, it is to match the habits of rural life, and on the other hand, it can also shorten the study period. The four-year university course can be studied in three years. In the sound of education reform, the college's experiment is worth noting.

Dean Chen Duanzhi used to be a social scientist, and he is also a hard-working person. He resigned from all official positions and devoted himself to this cause. Teacher Tie Ming, Head of the Crop Department Gu Fu, Head of the Horticulture Department Tang Mingxin, Professors Wang Linong, Shao Zhongxiang, Tong Yumin, Gu Boming, Liu Yubin, etc., are all authoritative scholars in the agricultural field, and the college has gathered them together, and the lineup is quite neat. Although it has only a short history of three years, the college has indeed laid an unshakeable foundation, and is worthy of being a major base for training rural work cadres, and is also a comet in today's rural construction journey!

### Japanese Cabinet Compiles Two Draft Budgets That Are Flexible to Adapt to the War Situation

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) — In order to adapt to the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese government convened a regular cabinet meeting on the 15th to discuss two draft proposals: (1) the compilation of the Showa 19th degree budget, and (2) the general outline of budget control for important matters in Showa 19th degree. Minister of Finance Kaya and President of the Planning Board Suzuki each gave explanations and then made decisions, and based on this policy, created a must-win budget for the next year. This matter was explained in detail by the Japanese Information Bureau on the 16th. According to the budget policy for the next year, there will be significant changes compared with previous years. Regarding measures such as strengthening war capabilities, urgent enterprise preparation, and food production, a huge amount of temporary additional budget was previously allocated, and it now seems to have been put into practice. This is different from the past, which only focused on dealing with the long-term war. Therefore, a budget that is flexible to adapt to the war situation is made. Now, only the policy of compiling the budget for the 19th degree and the general outline of budget control for important matters are compared and reviewed with last year's. According to last year's cabinet meeting, the main focus was on increasing the population and revitalizing and reforming education in preparation for the long-term war, and matters for negotiation were predetermined. However, it has been revised in the 19th degree to strengthen the essential scientific and technological war capabilities, increase the production of special scarce materials, and thoroughly enhance the transportation capabilities of the sea, land, and air. This should be noted that in terms of funding, the main policy last year was to vigorously suppress the expansion of funding, while in the 19th degree, the amount of funding is not considered, only whether it can be used to achieve practical results. As for those deemed necessary to enhance war capabilities, they will be vigorously implemented. In addition, a huge amount of reserve funds will be added to prepare for emergency measures, and its proactiveness can be seen.

### Reduction in Tin Sales Prices by Japan

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry has decided to reduce the selling price of tin and has instructed the Japan Metal Distribution Control Co., Ltd. (the national metal control agency) to implement the revised prices from today. The new prices are 430 yen for first-grade tin and 410 yen for second-grade tin per 100 kilograms, a reduction of approximately 48% compared to previous prices. The previous official prices were determined in November before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. At that time, based on the fact that 90% of domestic demand had to rely on Malaya, Medan, Bangka Island, and other places, the price of first-grade tin was set at 830 yen. Now that the southern tin-producing areas, which account for 67% of the world's tin production, are completely under Japanese military administration, the reduction in prices is inevitable.

### Numerous Germans Enlisting in the Navy

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency naval reporter Hansen stated that for every vacancy in the German Navy, there are three or four volunteers eager to fill it. Therefore, the navy's recruitment department is always able to maintain its principle of selective recruitment. Volunteers are assigned to various departments according to their aspirations. The recruitment department now warmly welcomes young volunteers with technical training, as this type of talent is especially needed for the expanded activities of German submarines. Young military personnel from the German army and navy often apply to transfer to submarine service, which shows the enthusiasm of German youth for seafaring. Hansen also said that he had spoken with naval recruits in training, and among these 150 recruits, 17 had transferred from other military branches. They had already received general military training and, after a short period of special training, could be assigned to military stations for service.

### India Recruits National Army; Enthusiastic Response

Shonan, 17th (Central News Agency) – Due to the overwhelming requests from Indian expatriates in Malaya to join the Indian National Army and volunteer to fight the enemy, the Shonan branch of the Indian Independence League, in order to accommodate this enthusiasm, began recruiting volunteers at the branch starting on the 16th. Upon hearing the news, Indians rushed to the branch to register. On the first day alone, more than 2,500 people registered. At 9:30 AM on the 17th, League President Subhas Chandra Bose personally visited the branch to thank the Indian youth who had enlisted and delivered an inspiring speech. Those who listened were deeply moved, and their determination to fight the enemy became even stronger.

### Brazilian Raw Materials

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – Havas reports: Brazilian Air Minister Felinto stated to reporters in Washington yesterday that the military raw materials delivered by the United States to Brazil are extremely insufficient, so it is impossible to implement the work added to it by the United States. Brazil most needs airplanes. In order to obtain better cooperation from the country, the delivery of important raw materials is necessary. After arriving in the United States, the Brazilian Air Minister met with President Roosevelt and plans to meet with Secretary of State Hull to make a complaint.

### Anti-Axis Merchant Ships Moved to Gibraltar for Repairs

Larrini, 17th (Central News Agency) – It is reported that several large anti-Axis merchant ships that have sustained heavy damage have been towed to the port of Gibraltar for repairs.

### Jadru Returns to Algiers

Tangier, 17th (Central News Agency) – General Jadru returned to Algiers yesterday. Jadru had visited Syria, which he once governed, on behalf of the Tej Commission.

### Thai Prime Minister Broadcasts, Claiming Britain and the United States Are Engaged in Propaganda and Lack True Combat Strength, Cannot Be Compared to Germany

Bangkok, 17th (Central News Agency) – On the 16th, Thai Prime Minister Phibun broadcasted from the Bangkok radio station a speech entitled "On Today's War," the main points of which are as follows: Radio stations in the UK, under British control, have recently been broadcasting news of the landing battle in Sicily, claiming that Britain has won a great victory, but the fact is that fighting is still continuing. My belief is the opposite, and I believe that the British army will repeat the defeat of Dunkirk. At the beginning of the war, Britain did not directly participate in the battle with soldiers, and France's fighting resulted in a disastrous defeat and nothing was gained. When France was working hard to strengthen itself, in order to maintain the balance of power, all kinds of pressure was applied to France, and after the war began, Britain remained motionless and did not send reinforcements to help France, watching success or failure. Even in the end, the force transported was less than 300,000. With this meager force, how could it compete with the German army, so it ultimately led to the disaster of Dunkirk. Now, looking at the East Asian side, at the beginning of the war, Britain believed that it could defend Hong Kong, Singapore, and the islands in the Pacific. The force it dispatched was less than 500,000, and the rest were Australian and Indian troops. Therefore, before half of the war was over, its forces were completely annihilated. Except for Australia and India, all British territories in East Asia were occupied by the Japanese army. After Britain was defeated in East Asia, it had nothing left, so it had to retreat to its island nation. In this war, Britain's position has not only completely lost its naval power, but also many small countries have left it. So far, the United States, the Chongqing government, and other small countries are still sacrificing themselves for Britain's ambitions. These countries, like France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, and Greece, have fought for Britain and paid a heavy price. Britain often fights with very little strength. Britain has no spare strength for fighting other than the British Isles. Because Britain and the United States do not have the true strength to fight, they are engaged in propaganda warfare. The world is tired of hearing about the landing operations in Guadalcanal, Attu Island, and Sicily. The islands they boast about are not as important as Koh Phai Island at the mouth of the Mae Nam River. The difference between the war methods of Britain and the United States and the war methods of the Axis powers is that they are only for propaganda, while the Axis powers do the opposite, only seriously engage in combat and do not engage in propaganda. When the Axis powers occupied Paris and Singapore, they did not carry out any major propaganda, while they constantly propagandize "victory, victory," but where have they actually occupied? Only a solitary island in the Pacific Ocean with no strategic value. However, their propaganda makes it seem like it is some earth-shattering event. Britain and the United States are currently trying to achieve victory in specific locations. For example, according to British reports, they are using more than 2,000 ships to try to occupy a small island like Sicily, and even for this small operation, they have been preparing for more than two years. Even they themselves doubt whether that island has such value. Since they are fighting for propaganda, we cannot help but doubt their dream of victory.

### Thai Propaganda Director Invited to Visit Japan; Speaks to Journalist Group, Believes Thailand Must Closely Cooperate with Japan

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) – Thai Propaganda Director Bai Raktham and Thai News Association President Phri Ka have recently been invited by the President of the Japanese Heavenly Feather Information Agency to come to Japan to observe Japan's propaganda organization under the decisive battle. They arrived here the other day, and yesterday (16th) at 4:00 PM, they met with a group of reporters at the Imperial Hotel here. The questions and answers with the reporters are as follows. The following is the answer by Propaganda Director Raktham: (Question) Please briefly describe the outline of Thailand's propaganda organization. (Answer) Thailand's propaganda bureau is roughly the same as your country's. Propaganda agencies must be closely linked to jointly plan propaganda operations. The current structure of Thailand's propaganda bureau is divided into six sections: secretariat, news, broadcasting, technology, enlightenment propaganda, and foreign affairs. However, the situation regarding Thailand's enlightenment propaganda has not yet reached a perfect stage. (Question) Please briefly describe Thailand's policies for completing the Greater East Asia War. (Answer) There are two main points to the policy of completing the Greater East Asia War: one is to maintain close cooperation with Japan, and the other is to guide the Thai people to adapt to the current situation. Also, News Association President Phri Ka's Q&A with reporters: (Question) How is the Thai News Association organized? (Answer) The Thai News Association, or the News Reporters Association, is more appropriate to call it, as it is a group that strives to assist the government in implementing its policies.

### Alexander Returns to Sicily

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Algiers, General Alexander, Deputy Commander of the Anti-Axis Forces in the Mediterranean, visited the American military area in Sicily on Tuesday. On Thursday, he went to the island again, lingered in the British military area for several hours, and visited General Montgomery at his headquarters. Alexander traveled by British destroyer.

### Anti-Axis Forces in Sicily Suffer Major Setbacks; Over Fifty Tanks Destroyed; Attempt to Break Through German Lines Fails

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) – Havas military correspondent Captain Setorius declared that the Axis forces are currently putting up strong resistance in Sicily. On Thursday, the anti-Axis forces made no significant progress and suffered major setbacks in many places. South of Catania, the tank fleet of the vanguard of the British Eighth Army was counterattacked by the German army and has retreated to the line from Gincori to Leni. Montgomery is currently concentrating his elite tank units near Augusta and withdrawing infantry from the Lentini area, so the British army may launch another attack on Catania soon. It is expected that the British army will change the central force advancing westward to an attack to the north, so as to support the tank force advancing towards Catania from west of Lentini. The left wing of the British Eighth Army northwest of Ragusa made some progress the day before, but it has no strategic significance. The British army's attack from Gela towards Caltagirone had made no progress by noon the day before. The Canadian troops on the left wing of the American Seventh Army made some progress along the coast towards Agrigento, but the claim by the anti-Axis powers that the area had been surrounded is not accurate. The American tank corps north of that place suffered extremely heavy losses, with a total of more than fifty tanks destroyed. The British army's advance into the Catania Plain also lost fifty tanks. Although the loss of one hundred tanks by the British and American armies in one day will not excessively affect their combat effectiveness, the number of tanks landed by the British and American armies on the island is small, so it is enough to restrain their actions.

Axis Reinforcements Arrive in Sicily

Stockholm, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to front-line news, Axis reinforcements continue to arrive in Sicily via the Strait of Messina.

German Perspective on the Situation in Sicily

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to Havas, after several days of silence, political circles in Berlin can now freely discuss the political and military significance of the war in Sicily. German newspapers are neither optimistic nor pessimistic, but only comment on the facts published in the German-Italian war reports, emphasizing Italy's firm attitude and its internal unity. Italian newspapers have also repeatedly stated this. Political circles here claim that in addition to its military significance, the war in Sicily also needs to be speculated on its political significance. Roosevelt, because of the upcoming presidential election, and Churchill, because of the general situation, both hope to enhance their position in domestic politics. In addition, Britain and the United States are under pressure from Stalin to fight in Europe and have to take action. Roosevelt and Churchill also hope to shatter the unity of European politics in order to trigger a political revolution. Political circles here concluded on this motive that although the war in Sicily did not occur on the European continent, Britain and the United States will encounter the joint resistance of the Axis powers and their allies no matter where they attack in Europe. Because in this war, there is no distinction between the Axis powers and their allies. Germany believes that the land of its common allies is no different from its own territory, so it will jointly contribute to the defense of Italian territory. The reason why Germany has stationed troops in Sicily from the beginning is also this. Sicily is not only an island belonging to Italy, but also the outpost of Europe. Although the defending forces on the island do not have the advantage of fortresses, they should give Britain and the United States strong resistance. The resistance of the Axis powers is enough to contain a large number of enemy troops, making Roosevelt and Churchill's hope of opening a second front in mainland Europe impossible to realize. As General Montgomery said, the occupation of Sicily is only a prerequisite for the establishment of a second front.

### Giraud to Go to England Soon

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – London news says that according to Reuters diplomatic correspondent, the leader of the North African rebels, Giraud, will arrive in London from North America approximately soon.

### German Army Advances Northward in the Belgorod Region; Soviet Relief Offensive in Orel Fails

Stockholm, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to news from Berlin received here last night, the German army is advancing northwards from Belgorod and has now expanded westward. This is the result of the German army's attack north of Belgorod. Although the weather is bad, the German army's progress has not been hindered. They have joined up with the vanguard advancing east from their original positions on a certain mountaintop. The remnants of the Soviet army in the forest area south of the new front line are now being cleared by the German army. The war zone south of Orel is also continuing to expand on both the east and west sides. South of Orel, the Soviet army continues its relief offensive, first bombarding fiercely with artillery and then attacking the German army with infantry and tank units. Fierce fighting broke out on the defense lines. The Soviet army was repeatedly repulsed and lost many tanks. In a certain operational area on the German side, 250 Soviet tanks were destroyed, most of which were destroyed by a certain German division. Although the Soviet army suffered heavy losses, it continued to attack on the east, north, and south sides of Orel, but was repulsed by the German infantry and armored units. The relief offensive launched by the Soviet army west of Kursk was covered by artillery, mortars, and tanks. This attack shows that the Soviet army is afraid of being surrounded. According to military sources, the Soviet army has lost about 3,400 tanks.

### Talk about the War Situation in Sicily

Since the British and American forces began their landing operation on Sicily Island, the first line of defense of Italy, two days have passed. In front of the solid defense line, the Axis forces ambushed them with ease, and they were blocked and retreated everywhere. The Asahi Shimbun used international wireless telephone to inquire the Berlin branch about the details of the Sicilian war at 8 pm on the 12th as follows:

Headquarters: What is the situation of the counterattack on Sicily Island?

Berlin Branch Manager Moriyama: There are many places where the enemy landed, and they were initially repelled only by the German and Italian coastal defense teams. On the 11th, the main force of the Axis forces waiting in the island began to move out. According to the German military authorities: British and Americans are amphibious animals that can move on land and sea, so they have a great advantage in landing operations, and they may initially achieve temporary success. But the troops that can land will never continue for long.

Headquarters: Will the enemy's paratroopers come again in the future?

Moriyama: They will not come again. According to the announcement of the German military authorities, the enemy initially used paratroopers in order to establish beachheads in various places, but all of them were annihilated. After that, the enemy seems to be transporting rear troops, so the German Air Force leisurely takes a wait-and-see attitude and strictly guards.

Headquarters: What is the situation in Italy?

Moriyama: Most of the attacks on Sicily this time attacked the places where the Axis powers had fully prepared from the front, and its purpose was to reduce the burden on the Red Army on the Eastern Front. But this has no impact on the German army at all, and the Eastern Front is not affected by it. According to the German military authorities, the only purpose of the enemy to start the Sicilian operation is for free navigation in the Mediterranean. The enemy is obviously very anxious about transporting troops and supplies to the Eastern Mediterranean. Moreover, the enemy's start of the Sicilian campaign also has the effect of a nerve war. But Gai (Italian newspaper editor, Mussolini's prime minister's mouthpiece) seemed to have said: In Italy, Sicily is only defending Italy's water. The first 10,000 lines. If the first line is broken, the Italian mainland will not feel any threat, and is full of confidence in defeating the enemy. So the enemy will encounter a difficult opponent.

Headquarters: Is the enemy's situation unclear?

Moriyama: Details are unknown. It is said that the enemy is already in a very bitter battle. When landing, a total of 2,000 ships were used, of course, these are all small ships. After that, they will bomb Germany and its occupied territories as before, but the defense of the European fortress has long been as solid as gold. (Sho: From the Western Asahi Shimbun on July 13)

The Chinese National Anti-British and American Association believes that on August 1st, the Shanghai Concession was returned to China, and the only stain on China's becoming a colony was completely washed away.

### This Newspaper's Sponsored Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting; Two-Day Exhibition Period Determined; To Repay the Kind Affection of All Circles, a 30% Discount on Marked Prices

Since this newspaper sponsored the Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting for Urgent Accounts in North China at the Xingya Building at No. 12 Bund, it has been enthusiastically supported by all circles, who have rushed to bid for purchases, which shows the deep concern for fellow citizens affected by the disaster. Considering that there have been storms and rain in a row, and also oppressive humidity, which has caused inconvenience to many visitors, the event, which was originally scheduled to close on the 18th of this month, has been extended for two days until the 20th of this month at the request of enthusiastic people from all walks of life, to allow those who have not yet had the opportunity to see it to do so. At the same time, in order to repay the kindness of the reporting circles, this association has decided to give a 30% discount on all the items on display according to the marked price. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will uphold the purpose of sympathy and mutual assistance, go and participate enthusiastically, and create blessings for the disaster victims.

According to another report, although there was a strong wind all day yesterday, those who went to visit and purchase were even more crowded. Among them, the Daqing Silk Shop colleagues donated 14 pieces of precious clothing materials such as real silk robe materials and new tweed, which were purchased by the film stars Wang Yin and Yuan Meiyun for the highest price. Other famous calligraphy and painting works were also purchased a lot. In total, more than 60,000 yuan was received yesterday, breaking the highest record since the beginning of the event. I hope that all circles will continue to participate and complete the mission of disaster relief.

### Amidst the Unified Promotion of Charity, an Interview with the Poor and Sick Relief Association (4): How to Subsidize Various Charitable Organizations?

After the second step of fundraising is completed, how will the subsidy work be carried out? The person in charge of the association said very cautiously regarding this question, in order to ensure that every dollar donated by donors in society is not wasted, and that every dollar achieves a certain effect, the subsidy of various charitable organizations must be approached with extreme caution. For charitable organizations applying for subsidies, we must first look at: (1) Is the purpose in line? (2) How are the results of the work? (3) What is the degree of urgent need for subsidies? Not just any charitable organization can apply to the association for subsidies. Generally, those with successful work, outstanding reputation, and genuine financial difficulties can submit an application to the association, detailing the type and nature of the work they do, the year and month it began, the actual situation of its progress, the reasons for the financial difficulties, the amount of subsidy requested, and attaching supporting documents and necessary attachments. After receiving the application, the association often has Secretary-General Xiang Kangyuan receive responsible representatives from the subsidization-requesting organizations, inquire in detail about their intentions, and explain the association's procedures for handling subsidy matters. The chairman of the association, based on the gist of the application and with reference to the Secretary-General's notes, approves or rejects each case separately. If approved, it will be submitted to the Standing Committee for approval. If it is approved, it will be submitted to the Review Committee (Chairman Wen Jie, Vice Chairmen Ji Zhen and Rong Boyun). After receiving the entire subsidy file, the Review Committee will review and approve or reject it in accordance with the Committee's procedures and detailed review standards. Approved cases must also be, depending on the nature of the applicant organization's work, sent to relevant members and accountants to conduct actual investigations, carefully examining the organization's history, person in charge, work results, financial situation, accounting books, etc., providing opinions and submitting a report to the association, before the Standing Committee decides on the method and actual amount of the subsidy. There are also extremely strict procedures for withdrawing subsidy funds. This extremely cautious approach can really reassure every donor, and also ensures that those who sincerely want to do good are not afraid of having nowhere to donate properly, and at the same time, it also provides practical assistance to those who sincerely carry out charitable work.

### The Japanese Economic Mission to China Flew Back to Tokyo This Morning; Leader Ogura Published His Impressions of the Inspection

Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the leader of the Japanese economic mission to China, led his team and entourage of twelve people, came to China on the 7th of this month. In Shanghai, they held cordial talks with people from the Chinese and Japanese financial circles, government officials, and the All-China Federation of Commerce, Industry, and Business Associations, and other business groups, regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. On the 12th, they went to Beijing to visit the Chairman and other relevant departments and economic figures of the National Government, holding cordial talks on Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and exchanging opinions, completing the expected goals. On the 15th, they returned to Shanghai from Beijing. On the 16th, they held a tea party at the Astor House Hotel, inviting relevant Chinese and Japanese government officials and people from the economic sector in Shanghai to express their gratitude. It is reported that the mission has completed its inspection task in China and will take a plane back to Tokyo this morning (the 18th). Yesterday (the 17th), in addition to bidding farewell to relevant Chinese and Japanese government agencies and economic circles, the mission also hosted a press conference at the Cathay Hotel at 2:00 pm to release their impressions of this economic mission to China.

Leader Ogura issued a statement to the press at the Cathay Hotel, entitled "On Leaving China". It briefly stated: As mentioned when we arrived in Shanghai on the 7th, the purpose of our visit to your country is really as a private economic mission of Sino-Japanese friendship, to have candid and cordial talks with people from the private economic sector and the National Government in Shanghai and Nanjing, hoping to create this opportunity to make a slight contribution to increasing economic cooperation with Japan. Since arriving in Shanghai on July 7th, we not only stayed in Shanghai for six days, holding cordial talks with people from the Chinese and Japanese economic sectors twice, but also stayed in Nanjing for three days, holding cordial talks with various parties, for a total of ten days. We are truly honored to have had the opportunity to frankly exchange views with the National Government authorities. Furthermore, we are very pleased to have been able to have cordial talks with various parties, allowing us to deeply understand the reality of the Chinese economic sector, the Chinese government's financial and economic policies, and the direction of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Regarding issues such as prices and currency with Shanghai as the center, enhancing production, and food, although we knew a little about them when we were in Japan, but after we arrived, what we saw and heard made us realize that these problems are actually more real and serious than we imagined in Japan, and that the importance and scale of these problems are even greater. Therefore, after returning to Japan, we sincerely hope to consult with various parties based on the results of this inspection, and then make suggestions to the government. Although we visited your country as private economic people, we believe that since we are now in the midst of the Greater East Asia War, and should adopt an integrated Sino-Japanese wartime economic posture, it goes without saying that we cannot promote the laissez-faire economic system as in the past. In short, the nature of the war economy must be based on a planned economy, and therefore private economy must also follow this direction. As described above, we sincerely hope to seek the integrated efforts of government and people to exert all our intelligence to work hard for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation for the sake of enhancing combat effectiveness. However, Japan has its own characteristics, and China also has its own characteristics. We deeply feel the need to utilize these characteristics. This time, we have further recognized the uniqueness of the Chinese economy, and firmly believe that the utilization of Chinese economic characteristics is of utmost importance. Therefore, when planning to strengthen the Chinese economy and Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, it is essential to pay full attention to this point in the specific methods. If one does not have physical contact with local people or scenery, it is difficult to understand the other party's characteristics. Therefore, in order to further understand China's economy, we will definitely come to your country for inspection as much as possible in the future. At the same time, we also hope that your country will send influential figures from the economic sector to Japan for inspection in order to understand the current situation in Japan. We believe that only in this way can Sino-Japanese economic cooperation achieve satisfactory results. We are very grateful for the hospitality we received from all parties during our visit to your country.

### The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Will Convene the Second Members' Meeting

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce will soon convene the second members' representative meeting after the reorganization. The date of the meeting can be determined within the next few days. After the promulgation of the "Provisional Regulations for Industry and Commerce Guilds," many industry guilds in this city have been reorganized. Therefore, it is necessary to re-register with the Chamber of Commerce. The city authorities are ordering each reorganized guild to re-register immediately, and at the same time, the guilds are also requiring member shops to complete registration within the deadline. As soon as this double registration is completed, it will be time for the Chamber of Commerce to convene the members' representative meeting.

### The Next Period of Household Rice Will Be Distributed by the Joint Venture Society

According to sources, the rice for the 42nd period of household supply may be supplied and distributed to the various districts by the Rice and Grain Joint Venture Society, as in the past, for sale. As for the quantity, it is still to be determined, because in the past week, a large amount of rice has been transported to this port from various rice-producing areas. The quantity is difficult to calculate at one time, but the total is estimated to be around 100,000 bags. In terms of transshipment, there is a serious shortage of burlap bags inland. And water transport is also quite troublesome, so it can only be transported in batches. In short, the food problem in this city should not be panicked.

### The South District Pawnshop Will Be Established Soon

The Municipal Economic Bureau, in order to alleviate the burden on the people due to the economic decline of the urban poor after the war, has planned to establish a municipal pawnshop. The plan has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. It is reported that the South City area has already been surveyed by the bureau to find vacant houses on Fangbang Road, and once preparations are complete, it will be officially announced that the pawnshop will be established.

### The Food Panic in North China May Be Eliminated Soon; Mr. Wang Kemin Releases a Statement

Mr. Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, arrived in this city from Beijing by plane on the 16th to attend to personal matters, and will return to Pingjin today (the 18th). The Central News Agency reporter went to his residence yesterday (the 17th) to inquire about the North China granary issue. He was pleased to release the following statement: Regarding the food problem in North China, since North China is not a rice-producing area, its rice supply depends entirely on Central and South China, while miscellaneous grains are mostly transported from the three northeastern provinces and various parts of Outer Mongolia. Due to the recent events, there is a state of food shortage. Currently, the price of millet in Peiping is around 1.5 yuan per catty, while rice is not easy to buy because people in North China mostly eat wheat. Chairman Wang is also extremely concerned about this matter. After the authorities' efforts, some wheat flour has been transported to North China, and a large portion of grain is still being transported. Moreover, the wheat situation in North China this year is good, and a good harvest is expected. It is predicted that the food panic in North China may be eliminated soon.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Announced the Quantity of Fifth Period Household Sugar; White Sugar Half Catty 2.35 Yuan

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating: From the 21st to the 31st of this month, household sugar will be sold by sugar retailers with sugar purchase certificate No. 5. At that time, the retailers with the registered number noted on the ticket will sell half a catty of white sugar (crystal white or granulated white) for each coupon, priced at 2.35 yuan. If packaging is required, a packaging fee will be charged separately. The sugar retail donation will be temporarily exempt from collection.

### Shen Bao Scholarship Fund Needs are Becoming Increasingly Urgent; Based on the Existing Scholarship Funds, Only 100 Yuan Per Student is Insufficient; We Await Generous Assistance from Society

The fifth Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund has been accepting applications since the 1st, and will be fully closed on the 20th. During this period, the amount of scholarship funds donated by various sectors has been higher than in previous years in terms of numbers, but the expenditure has been much larger than in previous years. The increase in tuition fees and the increase in the number of applicants mean that the existing scholarship funds of over 700,000 yuan are not enough to provide an average subsidy of 100 yuan per applicant. Although donations can still be obtained from various sectors, the current situation has left our colleagues at a loss as to how to establish the scholarship fund budget.

This Year's Scholarship is Particularly Needed

Based on the Shen Bao's past experience in running scholarships, it can be said that there has never been a budget. We only rely on the firm belief that society will have enthusiastic people and that humanity will have the compassion of mutual assistance. At the beginning of each application period, there is even not much savings. When registration begins, various sectors pay close attention to the progress of the scholarship fund, and are even more concerned than our colleagues. In previous years, the shortfall could be fully met when paying the scholarship funds. However, the situation this year is completely different from the past. The economic situation of ordinary poor families can no longer support their households, let alone the tuition fees for their children to study. Even families that were once well-off are now stretched thin, and have unspoken difficulties in paying for tuition. Therefore, the number of applicants this year is particularly large, and the increase in tuition fees for the next semester in various schools is also not small. Therefore, in addition to our colleagues' efforts, we sincerely hope that enthusiastic people will pay special attention to this year's scholarship fund of our newspaper and provide generous assistance to complete this task, which is also the good fortune of society.

We Deeply Admire the Enthusiasm and Assistance

Yesterday, Mr. Tang Xinghai generously donated 20,000 yuan to the scholarship fund. Mr. Tang is generous and charitable, and has always been willing to help with social welfare matters. This time, in view of the large increase in the number of applicants for the newspaper's scholarship fund and the huge amount of funds needed, he generously donated to provide assistance, showing great enthusiasm. Our colleagues deeply admire him. We are grateful to Gu Xinyi and Gu Chengzhai, the virtuous brothers of the Dingfu family, who specially donated scholarships for our newspaper's scholarship campaign, as the society knows well. This time, in memory of Mr. Dingfu, they generously donated another 5,000 yuan, and Shan Gong Ji and Xing Ji also donated 5,000 yuan each, seeking happiness for poor students. We are truly admirable. This newspaper specially expresses its gratitude on behalf of the aided students.

Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday

The list of scholarship fund titles received by this newspaper yesterday is as follows:

Propaganda Guidelines

Celebration of the Recovery of the Concessions Shanghai City Store Window Competition Propaganda Guidelines: The recovery of the Shanghai concessions this time is of great significance for the completion of our country's independence and autonomy. The citizens of Shanghai should have a warm celebration. The stores, restaurants, teahouses, dance halls, etc. in this city must base on the following points, use the original goods, and participate in the window display competition. (1) Those who participate in the window competition, the central theme of their design and layout, must fully display the warm intention to celebrate the recovery of the concessions. (2) The existence of the concessions hinders the integrity of our country's territorial sovereignty, and is the most serious cause of China's long-term chaos and the slow completion of the national revolution. The window layout should fully expose the sins of the concessions, and reveal the ambitions and tricks of Anglo-American aggressors. (3) The recovery of the concessions is the object of our country's struggle over the years, and this time, with the cooperation of friendly countries through peaceful means, this century-old scourge has been eradicated once and for all, establishing a strong foundation for the completion of the national revolution. Those who participate in the window layout should grasp the sincere assistance of friendly countries, implying that we should also cooperate with sincerity in order to achieve the completion of the Greater East Asia War. (4) The Shanghai concessions were the base for Anglo-American aggression against our country, hiding dirt and filth, and all dark sins were deeply rooted. Under the influence of colonial customs over the years, if you want to fundamentally improve the economy, you still have to wait for future self-restraint and efforts. Those who participate in the window competition should encourage the cloth people to learn from the past and be vigilant in the future, and strengthen the work of self-cultivation and reconstruction. (5) Those who participate in the window competition should point out the meaninglessness of the anti-war in Chongqing, and the facts based on the results of the peace movement, in order to smash the false propaganda of the United States and Britain and Chongqing, strengthen the citizens' greater belief in the peace movement, and raise the citizens' spirit of struggle.

Additional Notes

1. Those who participate in the window competition should first identify the theme and choose one or several points in the guidelines when designing the layout, and make appropriate arrangements.

### The Huatong Cup Charity Football Tournament Opened Yesterday: The Friendship Team Won 4-1 Against the Holy Portuguese; Shao Yili Kicked Off and Xia Shikui Bought the Charity Ball

The Huatong Cup charity football match, organized by the Huatong Sports Association, pitted the Friendship Team against the Holy Portuguese Allied Forces. It opened at Xuhui Middle School at 6:30 pm yesterday. There were five or six thousand spectators, and the atmosphere was lively. First, Mr. Jiang Yimen, president of the Huatong Sports Association, delivered a speech, followed by Shao Yili, director of the Tax Investigation Department of the Ministry of Finance, who presided over the kick-off. During the break, the charity ball was auctioned off. As a result, Xia Shikui won the bid with the highest price of 20,000 yuan. He was eager to help others. When the time came, the fierce battle began amid the sound of referee Shen Huichun's silver whistle. The Holy Portuguese Allied Forces lacked Victor, V. Suro, and Guaine, so their strength was inevitably affected slightly. Therefore, at the beginning of the game, the Friendship Team's offensive was strong. At five minutes, Li Yichen opened a corner kick, and Wu Qixiang slapped it in with his hand, of course to no effect. Fei also opened a corner kick, and Wu Qixiang was about to shoot, but it was invalidated due to offside. The Holy Portuguese counterattacked, but Carlos, Bredar, and others missed opportunities. At the eleventh minute, Fei Chunhua shot in the penalty area, but happened to hit Pan Lira's hand and was ruled a penalty. Sun Jinshun took the penalty, and the ball went into the net. Ten minutes later, Li Yichen advanced on the left and passed it to Asun. Sun was about to knock on the door, but Xu Erzi's eagerness to save the situation resulted in an own goal. In less than a minute, Wu Qixiang invaded the middle and Gao Baozheng moved up to pick the net, ending the first half with a 3-0 victory for the Friendship Team. After changing sides, the Friendship Team's offensive was still strong. Wu Qixiang led the team to attack, and passed it to Xiao Gao. Gao dribbled a few steps and calmly scored, making it 4-0. It was less than a minute after the start of the second half. The Holy Portuguese launched a large-scale attack, and Bredar tried to shoot, but unfortunately hit the crossbar. At the fifteenth minute, Fuen rode alone and directly hit it at a distance of more than ten yards, and bounced in from the post, pulling back a goal. After that, neither side gained anything, and when the time came, the Friendship Team defeated the Holy Portuguese 4-1. The first rematch is scheduled for next Wednesday at the same venue. The lineups of the two sides yesterday were as follows:

Economic Circles - Commentary

### The Consequences of Soaring Prices

We have repeatedly explained the causes of soaring prices. What are the consequences? The answer can be summed up in four words: "The people cannot live." Economist Dr. Li Xishi said in his recent speech: "When the economic envoys of friendly nations come to China, it is also when prices rise again. These envoys, in their spare time, will surely deeply understand what they see and hear. In the current situation where the people cannot live, seeking to put the economy on the right track is like climbing a tree to catch fish!"

"Nothing is more grievous than a dead heart" is an ancient Chinese saying. If the people cannot live, their hearts die. If their hearts die, all courage dissipates, which undoubtedly reduces the nation's overall ability to support the war. Therefore, "all warring nations now implement blockade policies against each other, with the aim of starving the other side's people, causing rebellion," leading to surrender. What is most painful is that "the current situation where the people cannot live" is not caused by the enemy's blockade policy, but by domestic speculative behavior. That is simply drinking poison to commit suicide!

Therefore, we sincerely advocate for the thorough elimination of all factors that cause soaring prices, especially the illegal profiteering behavior of officials and merchants, in order to reverse the dangerous situation of "failing to manage prices."

### The Old Rules of the Silver and Money Industry Will Be Revised to Suit Modern Circumstances

The current industry rules of the silver and money industries in this city have not been revised for a long time, and many are already hindering operations. The most obvious articles, such as Chapter 4 on the standard currency of the banking industry rules and the money industry rules, Article 5, which states: "All receipts and disbursements shall comply with the Ministry of Finance's decree of November 4, 1935, and shall use legal currency," have now been changed to use Central Reserve Certificates since June 21, 1942. Chapter 2 on business hours and holidays has also undergone major changes. Before the incident, foreign banks on the Bund originally rested on Saturday afternoons, while Chinese banks remained open. Now, all banks have adopted the same approach as the Central Reserve Bank. Therefore, Articles 2 and 3 of Chapter 2 of the industry rules also need to be revised. As for the money preparation treasury and the establishment of the money industry bill exchange, they have not been included in the industry rules. Therefore, the Banking Association has decided that after the new directors and supervisors of the Money Industry Association are elected and take office, they will submit these issues for discussion and revision to suit modern circumstances.

### The City's Coal Ball Supply Will Not Be Scarce - Rumors of Price Increases Are Completely Untrue - Coal Shops Are Taking the Opportunity to Secretly Raise Prices

Recently, the supply of machine-made coal balls in this city has been less than the demand. Some coal ball shops have used the excuse of insufficient distribution to refuse over-the-counter sales, and there are rumors that coal balls will soon increase in price. According to people in the industry, several coal ball factories repaired their machines at the beginning of this month, which stopped shipments for a few days, but it was very short, less than a week, and shipments resumed as usual. The current situation of supply exceeding demand is entirely due to citizens mistakenly believing rumors and rushing to buy. Coal balls are an indispensable fuel for citizens' daily life. The authorities have made full preparations. The output of each factory is determined according to the city's demand, so there is no worry about scarcity. Citizens should not make disguised hoarding purchases, which will affect the market. As for the rumors of price increases, they have been circulating for a long time. An investigation reveals that there is a legal profit margin between the price of coal dust allocated to each factory by the authorities and the price limit of coal balls. Recently, it was even heard that the price of coal dust may be appropriately reduced. The price limit for smoke-free coal from July to September of this year has also been officially announced and implemented by the authorities and will not change. Therefore, the rumors of coal ball price increases are completely unfounded.

However, some small coal shops use the excuse of increasing vehicle costs and the labor of old workers to sell each dan (unit of weight) for 4 or 5 yuan above the price limit. Because citizens need them, they have no choice but to let them exploit them. However, the expenses of families suffer a lot, and it is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this.

### Unified Tax on Finished Foreign Yarn Products - 5% Ad Valorem - More Than 600,000 Rolls of Yarn in Stock

According to the Jianghai Customs Notice No. 1698 regarding the unified tax to be levied on cotton yarn imported from abroad and directly woven into finished products: The matter of changing the unified tax on cotton yarn to 5% ad valorem was already announced in Notice No. 1694 on January 16 of this year. From now on, all cotton yarn imported from abroad and directly woven into finished products, in addition to import duties, shall be subject to a unified tax of 5% ad valorem. All merchants are hereby informed.

Furthermore, according to informed sources, it is estimated that the total number of yarn and cloth currently stored in warehouses in this city is over 600,000 pieces. This stock of yarn and cloth, if used to supply retail in this city, can last for three years. The Materials Investigation Committee is currently sending personnel to investigate.

### Wheat Transport Permits - 600,000 to 700,000 Bags Already Issued

Since the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee urged Chinese and Japanese grain merchants to purchase wheat from various regions in Central China, it has been heard that it has come to an end. Regarding transport permits, in addition to the first batch of 200,000 bags that have already been issued, the second and third batches have also been issued one after another, totaling 600,000 to 700,000 bags. They are currently being transported to Shanghai in succession. Approximately tens of thousands of bags have arrived. Flour mills have begun to rectify their internal affairs and will prepare to start work as soon as a considerable amount arrives.

### Official Price of Miscellaneous Grains - Under Discussion - Continuous Arrival of Beans

The miscellaneous grains market in this city recently closed due to high prices. However, the circulation of miscellaneous grains is crucial to the people's livelihood. Allowing them to be traded secretly is not a good policy. It has been heard that the person in charge of the industry is currently submitting a report to the relevant authorities, requesting the establishment of an official price to facilitate smooth circulation and benefit the people's livelihood. The official price is currently under discussion.

This morning, there was a slight source of beans, but sales were sparse. The price of soybeans has risen again, and Pudong soybeans are not far from breaking through the customs.

### Gu Ben Soap Will Be Subject to Price Limits and Rationing - Price Set at 30 Yuan Per Bar

The Soap and Candle Industry Association believes that soap is one of the daily necessities. The black market price is currently high, and factories are also producing little due to a lack of raw materials, making it difficult for the public to purchase. The association has therefore decided to set the selling price of Gu Ben soap produced by the Shanghai Gu Ben Factory at 30 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates per bar, in order to ration it to the market. It has already sent a letter to the National Commercial Control Board for approval, and it is expected to begin sales within a few days.

### Increased Production Movement Takes Effect - Ramie Production Increases

Due to the increased production movement, the output of ramie in Central China this year has greatly increased compared to previous years. It is currently being actively purchased by Chinese and Japanese Tibetan merchants. The total amount to be purchased this year is approximately 300,000 dan, but the price is approximately eight times higher than the previous year.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks initially fell and then rose, and in the end there were mixed ups and downs compared to the previous day. This was inevitable after a big rise, and there were still some remaining winds. Those holding stocks were still trying to struggle. In general, the prices of various stocks have risen too high. If there are no special stimulating news, there may be a small consolidation. Transactions on Saturday were extremely rare, as some stock companies were closing the market to handle settlements. Department stores fluctuated the most. Yong'an Company saw equalization after a sharp decline. Daguan was seen to return. New World saw a slight increase. Guohuo Underwear both fell. Jinglun and Jingfu's socks saw very small rises and falls. In the textile industry, Yong'an Textile and Xinhe Yarn Mill both declined slightly. Rongfeng Textile was firm. Small stocks were extremely firm, and many were absorbed by small investors. Da Zhonghua Weaving and Guoxin Dyeing and Weaving both looked forward to reaching new peaks. Among new medicine companies, Zhongfa declined slightly, and Xinya approached the customs. In the cultural industry, Shanghai Commerce and China reached new peaks. The world was consolidating. Nanyang Tobacco Company and Da Zhonghua Match finally saw equalization. Zhabei Water and Electricity and China Electric Power both rose slightly. Kangyuan Canning was increasingly strong. Jiuan and Da Zhonghua Industrial were firm. Xinyi Real Estate has already been seen to fall.

### Various Associations Establish Investigation Groups to Prevent Malpractice

After the various trade associations in this city issued notices to prevent the smuggling and hoarding of materials, reporters learned that in addition to establishing material allocation groups, they will also set up "investigation groups" to investigate the out-of-bounds actions of fellow traders. However, this organization only has the power to investigate the truth and has no power to deal with it.

### Trade Associations Urge Members to Register Again - Late Registration Will Result in Forced Shutdown

Most of the trade associations in this city have been reorganized in accordance with government orders. All members of the same trade should register for membership. The registration items include: (1) Business name, (2) Business type, (3) Capital amount, (4) Number of employees, (5) Establishment date, (6) Manager's name, and (7) Address. Each association must compile a list of members and submit it to the competent authority for filing by a certain date. The various associations have found that a small number of traders have delayed registration, making it impossible to compile the list. The associations have set a deadline for unregistered traders to complete the registration procedures immediately. Those who still fail to register after the deadline will not only lack membership qualifications but will also be ordered to close down.

### Activities of Various Trade Associations

The Shanghai Coarse and Fine Pigment and Sundries Trade Association previously had disputes with the Western Pigment and Dyes Trade Association due to different natures and various relationships. They were unwilling to merge to form a trade association. The matter was forwarded to the Bureau of Commerce and Trade for handling by the Ministry of Industry. It has now been heard that the Ministry has replied approving the Western Pigment and Dyes Industry and the Coarse and Fine Pigment and Sundries Industry, which belong to the Chemical Industry Association, to separate and establish their own trade associations for identification.

The lower-level organization of the Oil and Grain Professional Committee, the Oil and Grain Federation, is actively completing the organization in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions for the convenience of raw material collection. It is learned that the areas that have been completed include (Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Nantong, Jiaxing, Wuhu), etc., and it is scheduled to be completed within a few days. The organization of the oil and grain industry in the Bengbu area will be reorganized by the Chinese and Japanese Miscellaneous Grain Industry Committee. The oil and grain industry organizations in Nanjing and Zhenjiang are still being planned.

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Special Municipality Dim Sum Restaurant Industry Association has required all fellow traders operating dim sum restaurants to apply for membership in accordance with the law. However, a small number of traders are still taking a wait-and-see attitude and delaying membership. The association has repeatedly urged them to join quickly to avoid being shut down. To facilitate membership for fellow traders in the West Shanghai area, a West Shanghai office has been established at No. 23, Lane 126, Kainal Road. The membership registration matters have come to an end. In accordance with the Interim Measures for Grain Merchant Registration, it has been approved by the Grain Bureau to handle commercial registration on its behalf, and members have been notified to go to apply for processing by a certain date. Regarding the issue of raw material allocation required by fellow traders, in addition to the existing allocations, it is actively applying to the relevant authorities for various raw materials that have not yet been allocated.
