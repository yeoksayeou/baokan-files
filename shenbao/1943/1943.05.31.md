### On National Health

"A strong nation must first have a strong people," which, in other words, means that improving "national health" is the most fundamental point that every nation and every country must strive for to stand in the world. If a nation is unhealthy, the country formed by this nation will inevitably be scattered and powerless. This is evident in the facts of strength and weakness of various countries in the world.

Stepping back to individual health, it is equally the key to the success or failure of one's career. "A sound career lies in a healthy body" has been correctly recognized by everyone. Therefore, for the sake of personal career, one must pay attention to health; for the sake of national career, one must pay even more attention to health. We must urge the people of our country to pay attention and place our aspiring country on top of a healthy nation.

The health of our Chinese nation, it must be admitted, has major problems. Foreigners ridicule us as "sick men of East Asia," which points out the unhealthiness of our nation. Since the Opium War, the trend of drug abuse has further harmed and damaged the health of our nation. Today, in the midst of great upheavals in the world, we must be vigilant about our national health and wash away the shame of being the "sick men of East Asia."

Our height and weight have comparative differences due to geographical distinctions. Northerners are relatively taller, and Southerners are relatively shorter. Expressed in numbers, the average statistics show that the height of men in the Yellow River basin is 66.6 inches, the height of men in the Yangtze River basin is 65 inches, and the height of men in the Pearl River basin is 64.1 inches. The proportion of weight also has roughly the same differences as above. However, when examining northerners for the air force, according to past statistics of the Chinese Air Force recruitment, the most Shandong people who passed only accounted for 15% to 20%. As far as able-bodied men are concerned, perhaps less than 40% meet the standards for military service. Before the Incident, there was once an examination of the physique of 230,000 students in major cities, and the results showed that more than 90% had shortcomings. In recent years, due to malnutrition and lack of medicine, generally speaking, national health is actually even lower, which is the first point that the people of the country should deeply guard against.

Several diseases that have been eradicated or reduced in modern countries with advanced health care and medicine are still spreading in China. First, tuberculosis. The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau once tested more than 1,000 students, and the results showed that 87% carried tuberculosis bacteria. The situation in various places now is probably also considerable. Second, cholera. Although epidemic prevention work is very diligent, it is biased towards cities, and it is still quite active in remote rural areas. Hospitals without infectious disease equipment are often at a loss in the face of the spread of infectious diseases. Third, trachoma. It has almost invaded every household. 41% of those who failed the Air Force exam were due to eye defects. Fourth, venereal diseases. The spread is very common. The existence of secret prostitutes in various places makes it impossible to eradicate the seeds of the disease. According to the experience of general doctors, more than half of the blood of pregnant women shows a positive reaction to syphilis. It is sometimes very difficult to hire a clean wet nurse. Fifth, malaria. This disease has been rampant in the southwestern provinces for a long time. Sixth, dysentery, and seventh, typhoid, also often arise in time and cause great harm. Although we do not have recent statistics at hand, the mortality rate after the Incident, especially the infant mortality rate, must have increased. Before the Incident, the mortality rate in China was high at 30 (30 deaths per year per 1,000 people), one or two times higher than in European and American countries. The infant mortality rate in China (within one year of age) was high at 200, four or five times higher than in European and American countries, and may be even higher now. Although death from disease is inevitable for human beings, the excessive suffering and extraordinary death not only cause countless losses in human and financial resources, but can even destroy a race and plunge a country into an abyss from which it is difficult to recover. This is the second point that the people of the country should deeply guard against.

There are many ways to be healthy, and there are several points that everyone can follow and practice:

(1) Pay attention to nutrition in food. On the Chinese menu, there is nothing more beautiful than satisfying the sense of taste. In the past, we often prided ourselves on food, occupying one-half of the world's kitchen. However, we don't know that there are major problems with this kitchen. We have not only eaten ourselves poor, but also eaten ourselves sick. In the future, we should pay attention to whether there is nutritional value in what we eat. Instead of pleasing the palate, we should seek to nourish life. The objects of eating may be lonely and simple, but the substances needed by the body must not be lacking. Although in this situation of high prices and difficult living, ordinary people are actually not full enough, let alone pleasing their palates, the nutritional value is not necessarily limited to expensive goods, and we must try to find substitutes as much as possible so that there are no deficiencies.

(2) Pay attention to exercise. Although there has been progress in exercise facilities and promotion in recent years, many people who lack the habit of physical labor still love morbid beauty. Outdoor exercises, morning calisthenics, swimming, etc. should all be promoted.

(3) Pay attention to cleanliness. We lack the habit of cleanliness. Generally, people often have the habit of spitting anywhere, not bathing diligently, and letting their clothes be greasy. They also have little training in the virtues of public health, such as randomly defecating along the river and on dark roadsides, and the stench evaporates.

(4) Absorb air and sunlight. When building houses and designing cities, a certain amount of space should be left to allow for fresh air and ample sunlight. People in cities should also go out to breathe fresh air and meet with sunlight more often.

(5) Have sufficient sleep to recover from fatigue.

(6) Have a happy mood so that the mind is broad and the body is at ease.

The above are all ordinary and practical ways to health. As for how to eradicate various epidemics and how to improve the national physique, some are related to medical issues, some are related to public health administration, some are related to health education and health projects, some are related to social policies, and some are related to school education, which cannot be fully explained in a short article. In order to reduce the population mortality rate and revive the efforts to serve the country, we solemnly propose today that the country must first make the nation healthy in order to move upward.

### Spanish Fleet Dispatched to Strengthen Mediterranean Coastal Defenses; British Prime Minister Returns Home, Arrives in Gibraltar

Rome, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a Madrid dispatch, the Spanish Ministry of the Navy, in view of widespread rumors that anti-Axis forces will land in the Balearic Islands, issued a statement on the 29th stating that a fleet of six Spanish destroyers, all of the 153-ton class, had set sail from Cartagena to Palma in Majorca. While the stated purpose of the fleet's dispatch is ostensibly for exercises, it is observed that this is a hasty measure taken to strengthen the defenses of the Balearic Islands due to the anti-Axis forces' desire to land there. It has recently been rumored that the anti-Axis forces harbor great ambitions for the Balearic Islands. After beginning the invasion of Sardinia, the anti-Axis forces will occupy the Balearic Islands, and it is said that their plan may be to make the islands a relay point for the supply route for the invasion of Sardinia. Given the various circumstances, the dispatch of the Spanish fleet is noteworthy.

Stockholm, Sweden, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to Havas, the British aircraft carrier "Audacious" and four destroyers arrived in Gibraltar yesterday from the Mediterranean.

Madrid, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - A military correspondent for "ABC" newspaper claims that the British and Americans cannot launch large-scale offensives in East Asia and Europe simultaneously. The Allied Staff is well aware that an offensive on the European continent requires a vast supply organization, and manpower and material resources will suffer significant losses. Establishing a second front in Europe will deplete the Axis powers' fighting strength, and it seems that the United States does not want to concentrate its forces in Europe while having affairs in East Asia.

### Japanese Troops on Attu Island Display Great Spirit; Overwhelmed, Entire Force Dies Heroically; Department Chief Yanagi Delivers Broadcast Speech

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency telegram)

The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 5:00 PM today: (1) Since engaging with American troops on the 12th of this month, the Japanese garrison on Attu Island has continued to fight bravely for many days under extremely difficult circumstances. On the night of the 29th, they decided to use all their strength to make a final and heroic attack on the enemy's main force, displaying the spirit of the Japanese army's bravery. After a long period of bloody battle, communication was suddenly completely cut off, which is believed to mean that all personnel have died heroically. Before this battle, all wounded and sick soldiers who could not engage in the attack all committed suicide in advance. The Japanese garrison on the island was led by Colonel Yasuyo Yamazaki and consisted of only 2,200 soldiers, while the enemy had special and excellent equipment and 20,000 soldiers. However, by the 28th of this month, the Japanese army had killed as many as 6,000 enemy soldiers. (2) Kiska Island (east of Attu Island) is still secured by the Japanese army.

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency telegram)

Chief Yanagi Hanafusa, head of the Army Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, delivered a broadcast speech on the topic of "About the Bloody Battle of Attu Island" at 7:00 PM today regarding the battle situation on Attu Island announced by the General Headquarters today and the fierce fighting of the Japanese garrison on the island. The gist is as follows: The Japanese troops garrisoning Attu Island fought a bloody battle with the enemy for two days, and finally died heroically. Their heroic and courageous spirit is truly enough to shock even gods and spirits. The American troops who landed on Attu Island numbered 20,000, with tanks and excellent heavy weapons, and may have received considerable training in mountain and snow combat, and were protected by powerful fleets and air forces, so their strength was considerable. Our side had only about 2,000 soldiers led by Colonel Yasuyo Yamazaki, and were only equipped with a few artillery pieces, which created a situation of overwhelming disparity. When the enemy attacked from the sea, land, and air, they repeatedly attacked with fierce artillery fire, but our army carefully defended and seized opportunities to attack, separately defeating the enemy and inflicting heavy losses on them, and repelling them. Around the 27th of this month, the enemy gradually advanced towards our positions, and then launched a bayonet charge with knives and hand grenades. Even in this tragic and heroic situation, our unit commander Yamazaki never requested reinforcements or a single bullet. Such loyalty and courage that regarded death as home is admired by all. Furthermore, during the heat of battle, the enemy's formation, equipment, tactics, and the experiences and lessons learned in this battle, and the methods to be adopted in future battles were all recorded in detail and reported. There is a writing that says: "In this moment of artillery fire, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no crisis, and communication may also be cut off, so I have taken the opportunity to report in detail what I have observed." This strong sense of loyalty and great sense of responsibility can be said to be rare in the world. After days and nights of hard fighting, the morale of the Japanese army remained extremely strong, but as the number of dead and wounded continued to increase, by the 28th, only a few hundred people remained alive, while the enemy continued to replenish with new troops and strengthen their equipment. Colonel Yamazaki, observing the trend of the situation, resolutely made the final decision, that is, on the night of the 29th, he searched for the enemy's main force group and carried out the final attack. Those who were wounded or sick and unable to participate committed suicide before launching the attack. Colonel Yamazaki, after completing all the arrangements, reported the matter in detail to his superiors, saying: "We are aware that we should not be lucky in any way, and tarnish the reputation of a warrior, so we will die heroically with our subordinates in smiles." At the end of the report, the telegram was cut off. It is not difficult to imagine how tragic and courageous this final attack was. On May 27, American news commentator Hunt pointed out the difficulty of capturing Attu Island, saying that American Lieutenant General Hulzelm said that the Japanese army was strong, and all were courageous fighters who were determined to die. They are able to better demonstrate their characteristics in difficult situations, as evidenced by the situation on various Pacific fronts. Today, the Japanese army once again fought bravely on Attu Island. According to soldiers returning from the Southwest Pacific front, when fighting in a certain place, even if the Japanese army had only one soldier left, they still resisted fiercely with weapons. From this, it can be seen that it is difficult for the American army to suppress the Japanese army on Attu Island. The Japanese army's spirit of "do not win, do not return alive" is enough to chill the hearts of the American army. When the garrison troops decided to launch the final attack, they bowed to their homeland in the distance, shouted "Long live His Majesty the Great Marshal," and embraced righteousness in laughter.

### Darwin Port Bombed

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a telegram from New Gold Mountain, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced on the 27th that Japanese air units bombed the eastern area of Darwin Port on the 27th, causing considerable damage to the area.

### Britain and America Employ Familiar Tactics of Intimidation; Italy Remains Unmoved; Indiscriminate Bombing of Innocents Increases Italian People's Hatred; Germany Claims Retaliatory Raids Will Be Launched Against Britain

Rome, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to Havas, Roman political figures believe that the speech given by British Foreign Secretary Eden in Portsmouth the day before was a general threat by Britain and America against Italy. This familiar tactic of Britain and America is actually a result of failing to understand the morale of the Italian people. To accompany the threatening remarks in British and American newspapers and wireless broadcasts with real air raids only serves to increase the Italian people's hatred. The Axis powers' air raids specifically target cities and not military facilities, so their effect is merely to intimidate Italy. However, the Italian people will not be discouraged by this. Eden's claim that Italy bullied France, which lacked the power to defend itself, is absurd. When Italy entered the war, it should be known that France had concentrated well-equipped elite troops on its southwestern border. Conversely, what excuse can Britain and America give for the British attack on Diego Garcia and Madagascar and the joint British and American invasion of French North Africa?

Rome, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - Stefani news agency claims: The enemy's bombing of Afragola on Friday was yet another horrific act of destroying residential areas and slaughtering nuns and children. In this atrocity, many palaces and residences were almost completely destroyed, and nurses and children in two maternity hospitals were bombed to death. Three churches were destroyed, and one children's hospital was also bombed. Countless bodies of nurses and children were unearthed. The Italian King and Prime Minister, as well as the Minister of Public Works, inspected the disaster area within hours of the incident and offered comfort to the victims.

Rome, 30th (Central News Agency telegram)

It was revealed here last night that the number of children who died in the recent anti-Axis air raid on Calabria has increased from 33 to 54. In addition, 14 nannies were killed, and other civilians and students also died in this attack. When the anti-Axis air force attacked Foggia, they strafed farmers and livestock in the fields with machine guns.

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency telegram)

The German military authorities recently expressed their opinions on the British planes' indiscriminate bombing of Germany, stating briefly that after the start of the war, Führer Hitler suggested to the Anti-Axis side that they mutually refrain from bombing civilians, but they refused to accept and answered with bombing. The German side then gave a warning that if they did not change their ways, Germany would retaliate, waiting for Britain to reflect. Germany has endured for a long time, but they remain the same as before. The situation of their bombing is exactly the same as at the beginning of the war, so in the near future, German planes will carry out retaliatory bombing.

### Hungarian Prime Minister Clarifies Foreign Policy

Budapest, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - Hungarian Prime Minister Kallay declared in a cabinet meeting last night that the main purpose of Hungarian foreign policy is to safeguard the national survival of Hungary. He stated that Hungary is a reliable and valuable ally in the European war, and faithfully fulfills its obligations. Although the Hungarian army suffered losses in the fighting on the Eastern Front, it is of great value and effectiveness from the standpoint of Hungary's national position. Hungarian soldiers are dedicating themselves to Christian culture and European culture. The Hungarian Prime Minister also discussed the recent dissolution of Parliament, saying that he had to take this measure to prevent radical elements from using inappropriate remarks to prevent Parliament from having a peaceful discussion. The Hungarian Prime Minister also severely criticized Hungarian exiles, saying that no one in the country follows them, and they are merely being used by foreigners. He strongly stated that Hungary respects the rights of all ethnic groups. He pointed out that Hungary wants to live in peace with Slovakia and Croatia, and is now doing its best to eliminate disputes. Hungary is faithfully in love with Germany and Italy. The Italian Prime Minister and the German Führer both helped Hungary to lift the shackles of the Treaty of Trianon. Only the German Führer can protect Europe from the threat of the Soviet Union. Domestically, Hungary does not have a People's Front, and any attempt to organize a People's Front will be immediately stopped.

### Navy Soul (5) Admiral Togo in the Wind and Rain

— Kimura Shohachi

On the second day of the naval battle of the Sea of Japan, when Rear Admiral Nebogatov led his fleet to surrender, Admiral Togo continued to bombard the enemy's ranks non-stop. An aide standing beside him saw this situation and said: "Sir, the enemy has already raised the white flag." It is said that Admiral Togo's answer was: "I know, don't you see that the enemy ships are still moving?" One truly feels the crisp side of the Navy Soul. Later, when Admiral Togo accepted the five surrendered cruisers, he allowed enemy officers above the rank of officer to wear swords. This picture is based on a sketch of Admiral Togo on the "Mikasa" at that time, and was changed to one in the wind and rain. In reality, Admiral Togo had to stand firmly in the "clear weather" at all times. (Tao: Translated from Asahi Shimbun)

### The Soviet Army Disregards Heavy Casualties, Fiercely Attacks the Southern Triangle Stronghold; Both Sides Deploy Powerful Land and Air Forces in a Fierce Battle for the Kupensk Bridgehead

Stockholm, Sweden, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Eastern Front, stretching 2,800 kilometers from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea coast, includes approximately 1,800 kilometers from Novorossiysk to Leningrad and about 1,000 kilometers on the Finnish front. On this vast front, in recent days, the German and Soviet armies have become increasingly active, centering around the Kupensk area, the middle reaches of the Donets River, the Leningrad area, and Torez.  The entire line feels exceptionally tense. Although the two armies are currently engaged in fierce fighting only in the Kupensk bridgehead, they are fully prepared on all other fronts, waiting for opportunities. Where this summer offensive will be launched first remains unpredictable but is unlikely to unfold unexpectedly. According to German sources, in recent days, the Soviet forces, disregarding heavy casualties, have repeatedly attacked the German triangular stronghold. This stronghold is defined by a base approximately 100 kilometers long, stretching from the Kerch Peninsula to Novorossiysk, held by the German forces, with the other two sides being the German positions in the direction of the Kupensk bridgehead, measuring 80 kilometers and 65 kilometers respectively. This Soviet move aims to seize the German foothold in the Kakhovka area to prepare fully for the summer offensive. Simultaneously, they are attempting to retake the Sevastopol and Novorossiysk naval ports on the Black Sea side. However, the German perspective seems to be that while the Kupensk bridgehead has considerable strategic value, it holds no particular importance when considering the entire Eastern Front. The strategic value of the Kupensk bridgehead differs for the Soviet and German armies, which is noteworthy. However, based on the combat situation in the past few days, both the German and Soviet armies have deployed powerful land and air forces in intense battles. For example, on the 28th, 56 Soviet aircraft were shot down over the Taman Peninsula. Local well-informed sources claim that the situation on the Kupensk front is related to the summer offensive, and its progress is highly significant.

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – Colonel Hama, a military correspondent for the German News Agency, stated that the distinctive feature of the large-scale defensive battle at the Kupensk bridgehead on the 28th was the great victory of the German Air Force in attacking the advancing Soviet forces. German bombers and dive bombers continuously attacked Soviet rifle regiments and tank columns throughout the day, inflicting heavy damage. By the afternoon, the Soviet forces had penetrated the German lines in some areas, reaching the peak of the battle. Subsequently, a German reserve grenadier company launched a fierce counterattack, resulting in hand-to-hand combat, destroying 12 Soviet tanks, while another 16 were destroyed by the German Air Force. The main Soviet pressure was applied to the German positions east of Kupyansk and Moldavske. According to German military sources, the Soviet command, having failed in its attempt to break through the German lines three days ago, is now adopting a strategy of large-scale attrition warfare. However, given the losses suffered by the Soviet forces, this plan is unlikely to succeed. Despite the Soviet forces having ten times more personnel and weapons than the German forces, they have achieved nothing so far. The Soviet army suffered repeated setbacks in the first three weeks of this month, so the intention to capture Novorossiysk has apparently been abandoned. In the salt lake area near Temryuk, the Soviet forces launched another attack, surrounding the German defensive positions. Fortunately, the German forces had already anticipated their intentions, so they broke the encirclement after a short engagement. German Air Force bombers attacked concentrated Soviet ships in the same area, sinking a total of 16 fully loaded landing craft. On Friday, the Soviet side also dispatched a strong air force to bomb German supply lines. As a result of several air battles, German fighters shot down 46 Soviet aircraft over the Taman Peninsula, while another 10 were shot down by Slovakian aircraft. On other sections of the Eastern Front, only the area northeast of Lysychansk in the middle Donets region saw major battles, where the Soviet forces repeatedly launched attacks on German-held high ground, with several rifle regiments and powerful tank forces joining the operation. This ineffective attempt ceased in the evening. Soviet assault troops in the central sector were quite active, and Soviet artillery fire in front of Leningrad was extremely heavy, which may be a prelude to an offensive by the Soviet forces in that area.

### British Air Force General Walsh Arrives in the United States

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency)

According to Washington sources, British Air Force General Walsh arrived in Washington yesterday to take up his position as the head of the British Air Force delegation to the United States.

### Two British Submarines Lost

Stockholm, Sweden, 30th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from London, the British Admiralty announced on the 29th that the British submarine "Modern" was presumed lost after failing to return to port on time.

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency)

According to London sources, the British Admiralty announced yesterday that the British submarine "Regent" has also been lost. The submarine has a displacement of 1,475 tons, is equipped with one 102mm gun, two 40mm machine guns, eight torpedo tubes, carries 50 officers and men, and is commanded by Captain Knox.

### What I Have Seen of the United States

The following is the gist of a speech given by Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura, the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States, at a commemorative lecture hosted by the Kyoto Prefecture National Defense Association and the Kyoto Prefecture Branch of the Naval Association on Navy Day, and sponsored by the Kyoto Shimbun, the Mainichi Shimbun, and the Asahi Shimbun.

"Roosevelt's America," following in the footsteps of Wilson, pursues a grand global policy, unwilling to confine itself to the American continent. It insists on the Open Door Policy and the principle of equal opportunity in China, viewing the 400 million Chinese people as a funnel for selling their goods. Therefore, it does not approve of "Asia for Asians" and is determined to instigate conflict between China and Japan to undermine Japan's power. The American people now seem to have accepted this grand imperial ambition of the United States, but some still harbor isolationist ideas. If they suffer further defeats, public opinion may become divided to some extent. Roosevelt is well aware of this situation. The British Prime Minister also stated in the American Congress a few days ago the importance of not engaging in a prolonged war. America's attitude towards the war is rapidly becoming totalitarian. Their war aims remain those defined during neutrality in the "Atlantic Charter." In the Far East, due to repeated and devastating defeats in the ongoing war, they want to concentrate all their power in the Far East. That is why Churchill hastily flew to the United States, wanting to prevent America from retreating from the Atlantic.

After the Casablanca Conference earlier this year, Roosevelt, military officials, and politicians unanimously declared, "We will not rest until the enemy surrenders unconditionally." The recent Washington Conference seems to be vigorously discussing whether to focus on the Eastern Front or the Western Front. I have always pointed out that America still maintains a "Europe First" policy, while those within America insist that the Pacific should be given equal consideration with the Atlantic, not treated as secondary. They say, "Our enemies are the same, both in the East and the West." Currently, the main forces of the U.S. Army and Navy are in the Pacific, and the Air Force also places importance on this area. American public opinion polls show that 30% believe Germany is the primary enemy, while 60% believe Japan is. During World War I, one-third of the national budget was spent on the war; this time, it has reached 89%. During World War I, daily war expenses were $40 million; this time, they are $100 million per day, and recently even reached $250 million. The amount used for the Navy is enormous, so they also say, "This war will not be abandoned halfway."

We should fully understand this current situation, and this is precisely why Prime Minister Tojo's so-called "grand strategy" is necessary. So, what exactly does America plan to do in East Asia in the future? They are not preparing to engage in a decisive battle with a large fleet like the Battle of the Sea of Japan but are focusing on air warfare. Because of the failure of the Doolittle Raid on Japan last April, Japan has geographical advantages, so they are planning to seize locations near Japan as air bases. The movements in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, Midway Island, the Aleutian Islands, and mainland China are manifestations of this. India and the coastal region of Siberia are also under consideration. Stalin is very cautious about the coastal region, so we must be vigilant. At the same time, they are rapidly catching up in terms of improving the quality of aircraft, enhancing air combat capabilities, and training air force soldiers. America considers air warfare more important than ordinary warships, focusing all its efforts on aircraft carriers, which is evident from the allocation of personnel. Next, regarding submarine warfare, because oil tankers in the Atlantic were being heavily sunk by German submarines, they are also emulating Germany and adopting submarine warfare tactics, passing a large submarine construction bill in Congress, aiming to threaten Japan's surroundings. The resources of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are transported by ships, so Japan should urgently seek ways to strengthen various combat capabilities to counter the enemy's intentions. Whether this war will be long or short is still uncertain, but I believe a long-term war posture is absolutely necessary. The key to war is to maintain a superior advantage over the enemy in the decisive battle, in order to defeat the enemy. Therefore, 100 million people should unite both on the front lines and in the rear, to overwhelm the enemy.

Next year is an election year. No matter how great an actor is, from the prologue to the end, constantly appearing on stage will eventually become tiresome. Roosevelt also seems to be gradually worried about losing popular support, but we must not be negligent because of the enemy's weaknesses. We should intensify our efforts to build strength and move towards the final victory. (Transcribed from the May 28th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)

### United States Establishes War Mobilization Bureau to Handle All Domestic Labor Issues

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency)

A BBC correspondent in New York declared yesterday that President Roosevelt's establishment of the War Mobilization Bureau is equivalent to a large-scale cabinet reshuffle. Roosevelt's unavoidable adoption of this severe step is due to the increasingly sharp attacks from employers on the authorities' management methods and the growing spread of strikes nationwide. The leader of this new bureau, Byrnes, will use harsh measures to avoid similar situations in the future. At the same time, the U.S. Office of War Information stated that President Roosevelt's establishment of the War Mobilization Bureau will allow him to focus on international policy and military issues in the future.

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency)

According to Washington, President Roosevelt has ordered the establishment of the "Fair Employment Practice Committee" to eliminate unfair employment practices in American wartime industries. In the interest of national defense, the committee will handle all human resource issues without regard to race, religion, or national origin.

### Stanley Resolute in His Intention to Resign

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Huitong News Agency, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Admiral Stanley, repeatedly had his letters to President Roosevelt ignored. Most recently, Roosevelt sent a letter to Stalin via Davies instead of the ambassador. His determination to resign is now stronger than ever. This information was "obtained from well-informed sources" by the New York Times' correspondent in Washington yesterday. The correspondent said that Stanley also complained to President Roosevelt that American agencies and organizations within the Soviet Union all report directly to their respective U.S. departments, rather than through the ambassador. Therefore, the position of ambassador to the Soviet Union is essentially redundant.

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency)

According to New York, the New York Times' special correspondent in Washington stated that U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Major General Stanley, dissatisfied with the circumstances of his position, has expressed his intention to resign to President Roosevelt. However, Secretary of State Hull said that he was unaware of Stanley's intention to resign. According to the New York Times, Stanley told President Roosevelt that he felt that Davies' carrying President Roosevelt's letter to Stalin was a disregard for his position. Therefore, his intention to resign is even more determined. Stanley also said that reports from various American agencies in the Soviet Union are submitted directly to their respective U.S. departments, rather than being relayed through the ambassador. Therefore, his mission in the Soviet Union has become redundant.

### London March for Indian Independence Intervened by Police

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency)

According to London, the march organized yesterday by the Indian Independence Movement Committee here was intervened by the police and could not be held. Five or six thousand people participated in the march, including Mr. Brockway, the chairman of the aforementioned committee. According to Brockway's remarks to visiting journalists afterwards, Home Secretary Morrison had confirmed that the ban on the march was based on London's regulations prohibiting all political marches. However, the rally convened by the committee in Trafalgar Square was not dispersed. Member of Parliament Cove gave a speech, saying that the first step to liberating India was to release Nehru and Gandhi, the two members of the Indian Congress Working Committee. Today's terrible tragedy is that Britain's promises have lost credibility in India. Indian independence must be realized, and the British people must never subdue it by force alone. The soul of India has been awakened and will never fall asleep again. Other speakers included novelist and Member of Parliament Manning Makston and Brockway. Rome, 30th (Central News Agency), Italy

### A Major Tragedy in World History

Continued from the 20th of this newspaper

(8) Individualism of the Head of State

Edward VIII did not possess extraordinary talents. He had heard everything, seen everything, met all kinds of people, and experienced all sorts of situations, all of which were disproportionate to his age. His knowledge was merely like a camera, capturing fragmentary scenes, without special expertise in any particular area. He had no deep thoughts, no self-reflection, no worries, and no melancholy. He spent his leisurely years happily, laughingly, casually, and recklessly. In his youth, he participated in World War I, earning commendation for his bravery in actual combat. In short, he disliked formality and loved to break the mold. His daily life was always off track. Therefore, he was extremely popular with the working class, lacking the solemnity of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria. Many believed he would succeed his grandfather Edward VII.

Moreover, he had traveled around the world, exaggerating that Britain was the only major exporter of goods. He thought everyone else thought that way too. He went everywhere winning people over. When he visited Japan, it was just when the Washington Naval Treaty was signed in April of the eleventh year of the Taisho era. We have no other deep impressions left, but we remember that the news at the time recorded that on the way from Nikko to Chuzenji, the Crown Prince put on a worker's uniform at a teahouse, told his attendants to ride in rickshaws, and pulled them himself as a rickshaw driver, and we even saw a photo of that scene. The Crown Prince of a great empire that owns one-third of the world's land and one-quarter of the world's population, one cannot say that this was just a momentary whim; everyone must have felt that way!

The Crown Prince performed various out-of-the-ordinary actions everywhere. Once, he reportedly fell off a horse and broke his skull, which became a problem for the parliament.

He was born in 1894, ascended the throne in 1936, and abdicated 325 days later on December 11 of the same year. This is the so-called Mrs. Simpson affair. There have been many accounts of this matter in the world. But we are definitely not interested in those accounts. Moreover, this matter is already in the past, and he is living a life of pleasure as the Duke of Windsor. However, the reason we bring it up is that when we talk about the collapse of England, we cannot overlook this kind of event. How deeply individualism permeated the minds of the British people and the British monarch is powerful evidence. With the emergence of this kind of event, it is difficult for the British to use loyalty to the royal family to understand each other and believe it is a force that maintains the British Empire.

The Crown Prince had three brothers, and two of them were already married, but his eldest brother, the Crown Prince, was still single, which was incredible. Given the position of a Crown Prince, if he wanted to marry, his candidates would certainly be sought from a royal court or noble family. However, unexpectedly, the Simpson affair occurred.

It is generally said that Mrs. Simpson was of Jewish descent, and that may be true. In any case, that woman was born in Baltimore, USA. Her name was Wallis Warfield. At the age of adulthood, she married U.S. Navy Lieutenant Spencer and also traveled to Shanghai and Beijing. For some unknown reason, she divorced the young Navy aviation officer Sessell, and soon became close to a so-called Simpson. Simpson was a married man who, without any reason, divorced his original wife and married that woman. His job was as an agent for Simpson Shipping Company, and he lived in London.

Soon, the Simpsons and the Crown Prince hit it off, and the Crown Prince personally drove his car from nightclubs to take the Simpsons home. Moreover, according to the records in the palace, the Crown Prince often invited the Simpsons to dinner, which surprised everyone, wondering why such obscure people were receiving such preferential treatment from the Crown Prince. Soon, the records of the palace affairs no longer mentioned the Simpsons, but only Mrs. Simpson alone being invited along with other well-known people. Even more strangely, when the Crown Prince traveled to the Mediterranean coast, she became his traveling companion, and they even went to a winter sports resort in the Tyrol Mountains together. Wherever the Crown Prince went, Mrs. Simpson was always like a shadow, and her name was always mentioned. Therefore, the Crown Prince's travels were not subject to any formal invitations because of his travels with Mrs. Simpson, which aroused a lot of criticism.

Then, photos of the two shopping in the streets near the Mediterranean coast were published without restraint in American newspapers. People's comments on him spread from nearby places to the United States and even to colonies far from the motherland.

At this time, George V passed away on January 21, 1936. The Crown Prince ascended the throne as Edward VIII. The most surprising thing to the world after he became emperor was that in August of that year, when the emperor traveled on the "Nahlin" along the Adriatic Sea in the Mediterranean, Mrs. Simpson unexpectedly participated. During this trip, there was no way for the British Emperor to receive personal invitations, so he broke with tradition, and the Hungarian government invited Edward VIII and Mrs. Simpson.

By October of that year, the news of Wallis Simpson's divorce lawsuit gradually spread. Mrs. Simpson accused her husband, Ernest Simpson, of violating her chastity, and filed a divorce lawsuit. After six months, Mrs. Simpson's divorce was finalized, and she gained the freedom to marry anyone.

By December 1936, it caused a great uproar. Although all the news magazines remained silent on this matter, the parliament raised this matter as an issue. At the time, the American news king Hearst happened to be at his Welsh mansion in England, where he met with the Emperor's auxiliary secretary Thomas, learned the details, and immediately sent a telegram across the Atlantic to the Pacific coast. The telegram said:

"Mrs. Ernest Simpson of Baltimore will obtain a divorce permit within a few months and will marry King Edward VIII of England eight months later."

The matter has come to this point, and it cannot be ignored. The parliament then formally discussed this matter.

Prime Minister Baldwin met with the Emperor several times to discuss this matter, but he could not change the Emperor's decision. It goes without saying that the Queen Mother Mary repeatedly advised the Emperor. Mrs. Simpson declared: "I have no intention of interfering with any of the Emperor's decisions," meaning that even if the Emperor canceled the marriage agreement, she would have no objection. However, the Emperor had the intention to marry from the beginning and would rather give up the throne to marry. He did not want Mrs. Simpson to be treated as a queen. He wanted to ensure that the children they would have would not be counted in the royal succession system in order to end this situation. However, there was no precedent for this in Britain, and it did not work out in the end.

In individualistic England, many people sympathized with this matter, saying, "The Emperor insists on carrying out his will." Some people in parliament also said: "Is this not the King's personal matter? We have no room to intervene," wanting to gloss over this matter.

We are not making any criticism of Edward VIII in our personal capacity. But if we think about what the Emperor's duties are, then we should have reflected before this final stalemate came. However, he did not reflect, and the world did not reflect on this either. Many people regarded it as nothing strange, letting it pass like clouds and flowing water. From one point of view, it is a pragmatic and expedient country, and from another point of view, it is a thoroughly individualistic country. At the same time, it is also a question of whether this kind of action has the power to unite the British Commonwealth. The Chinese have a saying: "Driving six horses tied with a rotten rope," which is similar to this situation. So, what else can defend and prevent the collapse of the British Empire? Stuck in a dilemma, the only thing to rely on is the United States. However, this is just a frog jumping into the mouth of a venomous snake.

### Both Concessions Will Begin Universal Checks for Epidemic Prevention Certificates Tomorrow; Citizens Should Carry Certificates with Them

The health authorities of both concessions have decided to commence, from tomorrow, universal checks for epidemic prevention certificates within the concession areas, in conjunction with the police and Baojia [self-defense units]. It is hoped that citizens who have already been vaccinated will carry their epidemic prevention certificates with them at all times for inspection. Those who have not yet been vaccinated should quickly go to the nearest health clinic or Baojia joint vaccination station to get vaccinated, to avoid various troubles during inspections. The certificate inspection work starting tomorrow will largely involve setting up partial obstacles on important streets, manned by police or Baojia personnel. Pedestrians passing through must present their epidemic prevention certificates; those without certificates will be forcibly vaccinated.

Vaccination Numbers Have Decreased. According to personnel from epidemic prevention vaccination teams at intersections of major roads in both concessions, speaking to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, seven or eight out of ten pedestrians currently passing by already have vaccination certificates, so the number of people receiving vaccinations is not very crowded. As for the Baojia area joint vaccination stations, the number of people receiving vaccinations daily has also decreased significantly recently. The reason, it is said, is that the majority of residents in these areas have already been vaccinated.

Entertainment Venues Restrict Visitors

At the same time, according to a Datong News Agency reporter's investigation, in order to maintain public health during the hot season, the French Concession authorities, in addition to cooperating with their two municipal districts to implement a plan to disperse beggars from the streets, have also ordered cinemas, theaters, and amusement parks within the concession to enact prohibitions, refusing entry to those with tattered clothing or skin diseases, in order to prevent infection.

### "Canary" Charity Performance to Help with Disaster Relief

Our newspaper is receiving donations for disaster relief in North China. We are grateful for the generous contributions from all sectors.

As the first response from the drama community, we have decided to hold a charity performance of 'Canary' on June 3rd (Thursday) during the daytime. That day would originally be the forty-seventh day of 'Canary's' performance, and according to regulations, there would be a day off and no performance during the daytime. However, our staff does not want to be idle and is willing to go on stage for all the disaster victims in North China, fulfilling our responsibility to 'contribute our strength.'

### Female Teacher Dies of Shame and Indignation; All Sectors Express Outrage; Sheng Peidong and Others Collect 3,000 Yuan for Funeral Expenses; Also Advocate for Improving Teachers' Salaries

Ms. Su Yizhi, a teacher at Sacred Heart Elementary School in Hongkou, was unreasonably beaten and humiliated by a student's parents and died of shame and indignation. All sectors expressed indignation and, in addition to sending condolences, sent letters expressing their outrage and upholding justice. Excerpts from the original letters are as follows: (1) Letter from Sheng Peidong and others: "Ms. Su Yizhi, a female teacher at Sacred Heart Elementary School, deeply understood the importance of her duties. She punished misbehaving students, which was a manifestation of her loyalty to her duties and is admirable and commendable. However, the parents of the punished student not only did not appreciate this but also beat and humiliated her, leading to her suicide. This is an extremely tragic event in the world. We believe that on the one hand, the deceased should be fully compensated and commended. On the other hand, we should loudly call for improving the treatment of all teachers serving in national education, especially elementary and secondary school teachers. In this time of high rice and firewood prices, who would be willing to take on this arduous task? We respectfully submit 3,000 yuan for funeral expenses and request that you find a way to transfer it to Ms. Su Yizhi's family. - Respectfully submitted by Sheng Peidong, Hu Xigan, Chen Xuejian, Shao Jingfu, Chen Pengxian, Zhou Buyu." (2) Letter from Guoqiang Elementary School: "Elementary school education is the lifeblood of the nation, and elementary school teachers only hope for the success of their students' studies. Parents should respect teachers, but these parents were ignorant. It is truly lamentable. If they are not severely punished, what hope is there for the future of education? We have collectively raised 600 yuan and request that it be transferred to the deceased's family. We also hope that people from all sectors will uphold justice." (3) Letter from Yan Ziying: "Your newspaper reported that Ms. Su Yizhi, a teacher at Sacred Heart School, died of shame and indignation after being beaten and humiliated by a student's parents. Society is filled with indignation. I am now submitting 100 yuan and request that you send condolences to her family on my behalf."

### Advocating "Restoring the Way of Confucius"

Zhou Lingshu, a renowned master of Chinese music, arrived in Shanghai on the 29th of this month. Taking advantage of his presence in Shanghai, a reporter visited Mr. Zhou yesterday (the 30th, morning) and was granted an audience. Mr. Zhou delivered a grand discourse on advocating the Way of Confucius and Chinese music, stating: "Our respect and admiration for ancient culture should not be limited to form; we should study its principles, select those aspects of ancient learning that are suitable for modern needs, and promote them. Those that are not suitable should be preserved. We should not forget ancient culture because of the times. Both sides must be incorporated for the revival of Chinese culture to be achieved." He also stated: "The use of rituals is to provide external models of propriety, while the function of music is to harmonize and regulate our inner hearts. Therefore, rituals and music must be given equal importance and practiced together. If we want our country to be strong, we must first promote the Way of Confucius, revive our inherent culture, and advocate Chinese music." He further stated that the difference between the Duke of Zhou and Confucius is that the Duke of Zhou invented and created the principles of learning, while Confucius organized and compiled them into a great synthesis. Therefore, we should use the spirit and methods of Confucius to study ancient Confucianism in our country, adapt it to the current global environment, and seek the revival of our country's culture.

Economic Affairs

### Vigorously Implementing the Evaluation System

Stabilizing people's livelihoods lies in reducing the burden of people's lives. Reducing the burden on people lies in suppressing the prices of daily necessities. This is a perfectly clear plan. Even those who are not economic scholars deeply understand this meaning.

Recently, it has been heard that the highest authorities will use four countermeasures as the basis for implementing economic control: unifying the organizational structure of industry and commerce, vigorously implementing the evaluation system, promoting the development of trade and transportation in various regions, and maximizing the production efficiency of Chinese and Japanese factories and enterprises. It can be said that none of these countermeasures are not essential measures to relieve or reduce people's fear of life, and what we believe is the most suitable method for the current urgent remedy is none other than the vigorous implementation of the evaluation system.

We have repeatedly said that the first key to solving the current price problem is to seek the rationalization of prices; to give the most reasonable calculation to the cost and profit of manufacturers, and then, based on this calculation, to set the most reasonable price, so that the wholesalers and retailers of various commodities can maintain their proper profit, and there is no excuse to raise prices. Therefore, they will have to understand and carry out their normal and proper transactions under the evaluation method. Therefore, the vigorous implementation of the evaluation system is the best way to solve the price problem at present.

However, in all matters, the method of governance and the people being governed are equally important; once an evaluation system has been established, there must be evaluation personnel; therefore, the organization of evaluation personnel is the prerequisite for the vigorous implementation of the evaluation system. We feel that the ideal standard for selecting evaluation personnel should be based on their actual experience and knowledge of the commercial conditions of various commodities, and not merely on their position and reputation in the industrial and commercial community, because reputation is one thing, and practical experience and practical knowledge are another.

### The Economic Bureau Will Continue to Handle the Registration of Eight Major Commodities Starting Tomorrow; All Those Storing Them Must Complete Registration Within the Time Limit

The general registration of major commodities such as cotton, matches, soap, and candles was completed on the 10th of this month. Among the general registrations held last time, there are eight major commodities, such as wool fiber and wool products, that have not been registered. Therefore, the Bureau has been ordered to continue the registration from tomorrow (June 1st) to June 30th. All those storing these eight major commodities must fill out the form and submit it for registration within the time limit.

### The Silver Industry Association's Reserve Fund Is Increased; Interest Rate on Call Loans

In order to stabilize the entire financial situation, the Silver and Money Industry Association's Reserve Fund has carefully handled call loans for member banks and has increased the interest rate on call loans to five jiao, which is equivalent to 1.5 percent per month. Regarding call loans, they are handled in accordance with the revised call loan regulations. It was learned yesterday that each bank and store is providing property as collateral to apply for call loans.

The term of the call loan is set at ten days, but it may be repaid early.

### The Economic Shanghai Construction Committee Held Its First Meeting Yesterday

The Economic Shanghai Construction Committee, newly established within the Chamber of Commerce, held its first committee meeting at the Japan Club at noon on the 29th. Consul General Yano (Deputy Consul Tanaka) and Deputy Consul Morita attended and provided guidance. In addition to Chairman Aoki and Executive Director Takeuchi, 29 other committee members attended the meeting. First, Chairman and Committee Chairman Aoki stood up and delivered a speech, followed by a speech by the representative of Consul General Yano, who stated: "Shanghai is the economic center of all of China. Without the economy of Central China, the economy of North China cannot be used smoothly. Shanghai is the heart of the economy of all of China, and its position is extremely important. The development of Japan's policy toward China, grasping the hearts of the people and economic construction, takes this as its goal. As for its promotion methods, in the past, it was always guided by the Japanese side. From now on, this policy will be promoted with the Chinese side as the center. The Japanese side will guide the Japanese economic community in accordance with the ideals of the Greater East Asia. At this important time, the new establishment of three committees by the Chamber of Commerce can be said to be timely and deeply gratifying. It is hoped that all committee members will contribute proposals for Shanghai's economic construction at any time and cooperate to complete the new policy." Then, Executive Director Takeuchi proposed that small committees be set up for the industrial and financial sectors, which have the basic conditions for economic Shanghai construction. The entire venue unanimously agreed and passed the proposal. The list of committee members for the two small committees will be selected by Chairman Aoki. During the meeting, issues such as labor, industry, and the economic division of labor between China and Japan were also discussed, with industry and finance as the focus. It was also decided that if necessary during the process, other committees may be established. It is also heard that the members of the small committees will be appointed by the chairman in the next day or two, and it is planned to convene a small paper committee next week. It is also planned to determine the secretary of the committee at the same time as the small committee members. (Yunpeng: Translated from the Mainland News on May 30).

### Shanghai Financial Market Conditions: Weak First, Then Strong This Week; Officially Set Prices Remain Unchanged

This week's financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai were weak first and then strong amid continued tight credit. Transactions remained flat. Although price fluctuations were larger than in the past, the volume of transactions did not increase significantly. Yellow gold fell consistently at the beginning of the week, but then recovered due to enthusiastic absorption, but it was still 100 to 200 yuan lower than the limited price. The quoted price for buying and selling transactions in silver shops changed very little. The market price of patterned silver was unchanged. The interest rate for call loans among Qian Zhuang [traditional Chinese banks] started at two jiao. Discounting of bills was flat. Chinese stocks were sometimes weak and sometimes strong. Public bonds changed little. The market price of yarn and cloth fell. The Municipal Council's officially set prices for various food items, such as grains, flours, and miscellaneous grains, remained unchanged as usual. Credit is not easy to ease during the Dragon Boat Festival period.

### The Struggler in the Printing House

— Jin Jiang

Hunching our backs all day, huddling up in the light of electric lamps, for six years, our lives have been spent like this. But what we have encountered is beyond expectation. Now, let us take advantage of this small corner of precious land to make a happy yet painful moan!

(I) This is a printing house, since the war, the number of partners has been reduced from more than ten to four. Such work is distributed to the four of us who are neither beast nor man. To eat, who dares to say no?

(II) What about our meals? It's laughable. Each meal has only a pot of green vegetables. Not to mention that the rice has turned into congee, and the congee has become non-pure rice congee. We must exert the greatest labor, and we get the worst reward. But we don't resent these things - This is an emergency - the owner said.

But the owner keeps three wives, more than twenty children, and male and female servants. They live in delicacies every day. For six years, a pot of green vegetables and congee are our lives. For six years, four companions have been doing the work of more than ten partners, playing the sad song of life. I wonder when we can change our lives and move towards the light!

### The Child is Groping

— Shi Ting

Along the vast path of the setting sun, strolling by the creek. The evening breeze gently ruffles our messy hair, containing a strong earthy smell, and the biting spring cold has disappeared. Spring has just come, and then it suddenly leaves. Spring here is so short! I can't help but sigh.

The sunset fades the bright colors, gray-blue, dark purple... quietly floating in the sky, are the crows returning from foraging, calling aimlessly on the treetops, looking for their home. Mothers lengthen their slightly hoarse voices, calling out to the children playing in the wild.

The early summer evening is filled with dreamlike mystery and tranquility, as poets have sung. Even in this chaotic and war-torn year, the early summer evening is still dreamlike, mysterious and tranquil? The turbid stream flows, flows... calmly, without the rapid swirling whirlpools, the splashing of water! The rusty barbed wire, the wooden frame is mostly tilted, still tightly wrapped around the creek, and some broken wires tremble slightly in the evening breeze. The wilderness seems to endure the shackles on his body forever, bear the scars all over, and stretch on the other side of the creek; the broken tiles cling to the ruins, the buildings emptied of people open their wounded eyes, dimly facing the setting sun. For years, it has been so desolate and desolate. During the day, some farmers silently cultivate their vegetable fields by the creek. Now, there are only groups of rice carriers shuttling through the ruins, flashing hurried shadows. I heard that the price of rice has become cheaper in the past two days. Many rice sellers on the street come to the door, but no one wants it. But listening to their shouts, the tone is always light, without sadness or resentment...

The early summer evening here is filled with mystery and tranquility, depressed mystery and tranquility.

We hummed the words "The cold and clear sunset, with only a willow tree bending over".

"Do you have any change? A begging child!" Suddenly, touched my arm and quickened his pace.

I followed his gaze: an eight or nine-year-old child, dragging ill-fitting broken shoes, followed from the left. It seemed that there was no possibility of avoiding him. I groped in my pocket, thinking: "I don't have any change, what a mess!"

But unexpectedly, he didn't come to beg. The stubborn hand that was expected to be stretched out to beg straightened his skewed collar. He stared at us for a while and asked, "Uncle! Is this Caishi Road?"

I looked around in confusion: such a young child, with weak legs dragging those wide broken shoes, groping towards Caishi Road in the hazy dusk.

"Little brother! What are you doing on Caishi Road? It's still far from Caishi Road!"

He seemed to have lost something, staring at my face, and then glancing around in disappointment: "Looking for Mom! She hasn't been home for three days!"

Looking for mom? Not home for three days? Prostitute? Or committed suicide? ... I was immediately drawn to the fate of this strange child, and looked in surprise at C beside me, who was staring blankly at the child's face. Maybe he was also imagining the child's home: a dark little house, a sick father...

"What does your mom do? Why hasn't she been home for three days?" I gently patted his shoulder.

"Mom?" He raised his dry eyelids and wiped the eye mucus with his hand: "She carries rice. The day before yesterday morning, she cooked porridge for us, and then she went out. She said to my brother: 'Buy some dried turnips and eat two meals of porridge, and I'll be back tonight!' But it's been three days now... My brother said: 'I'll cook some porridge, and you go to Caishi Road and look for her'..."

He stared at the distant shimmering eyes, and said lightly: the tone was so flat, without emotion, as if he was telling someone else's story. At one point, I suspected that this wide and unrealistic story was used to beg.

"Then, where is your father?" I carefully watched his expression and asked, as if to find loopholes in his story - why didn't he mention his father at all?

"Father has been in the police station for half a month. Even Mom doesn't know why. She shakes her head when I ask. Father collects garbage. He often goes to the police station... But, uncle! Where is Caishi Road? Please tell me how to get there!"

I was stunned, the contemptuous expectation was not the fact. But how should I direct him? Go straight, turn left, and then right... the child would not be able to remember clearly.

"Well! Caishi Road goes straight... But, little brother, I think you should go home! It's getting dark, you are such a small child. You'll get lost. Besides, Mom may not be there. If she was there, how could she abandon you and not come back for three days?"

"No way!" He said firmly, "My brother said: 'She's there'" He dragged his wide broken shoes and went forward again.

I watched his back disappear, and looked at the shadows of the rice carriers scurrying in the distance, and whispered to myself: "Let me go and tell him! 'Your mom will not be there! She may not be alive!'"

But C held my hand tightly and sighed: "Don't wound his young soul! It's getting late, let's go home!" I vaguely noticed that there were tears in his eyes!

The dusk was getting deeper, and the surroundings were filled with dark purple haze. The outline of the thatched cottage gradually blurred, and silence pressed down on the sighs of the earth. The dusk was even more depressing.

The sound of broken shoes dragging faintly came from the front, the child was groping.

### Random Thoughts on Reading

— Zhou Su

In the "Extra Words Outside the Letters" of "Xiaocangshanfang Ruler and Letters", there is a passage that says:

"Xu Jingzong of the Tang Dynasty was good at medicine but refused to write a book, saying: 'I am afraid that people will get what I say, but they cannot get what I do not say, and they will definitely use medicine indiscriminately.' These two sentences can be used to understand the Tao of writing poetry and prose."

Although the words are few, the predecessors' intentions in writing and the cautious attitude towards writing can be seen from this, which makes people admire the demeanor of the ancients.

Today, although there is no shortage of well-educated people who are unwilling to write easily, there are also many people who rashly write books, as many as the sands of the Ganges. Among them, some people have no choice but to do this for the sake of livelihood, which is understandable; another kind of people are all for the sake of seeking false fame, which is even more unworthy of being followed. However, no matter what the motive is, the result of rashly writing books is always misleading to the world, which is not right!

When I was reading in middle school, my mathematics teacher Mr. Zhu earnestly told us in the classroom not to publish any works or articles until we were forty years old, because our knowledge and experience had not yet reached a rich and mature state. However, as soon as I left school, I forgot Mr. Zhu's advice. Over the years, I have published dozens of trivial and incomprehensible things in the newspaper supplement, and I am still "self-satisfied" in my heart. Now, when I see the words in "Xiaocangshanfang Ruler and Letters" and "Extra Words Outside the Letters", and I think of Mr. Zhu's admonition again, I feel even more ashamed and ashamed. "Knowing that it is wrong and deliberately committing it", and the accumulated habits are difficult to change, causing harm to the world, it is really a serious sin, Amitabha.

### Autobiography of Mr. Banknote

— Ling Zuren

My surname is Chao (钞, banknote), my name is Piao (票, ticket), and I come from a giant clan. The Central Reserve Bank, a prestigious giant family on the sea, is my original home. Therefore, people also call me Zhongchuquan (中储券, Central Reserve Currency), also known as C.R.B.

At the beginning of the issue, I tested my power a little, and with one kick, I kicked out the old legal currency, and used my brand-new posture to dominate the market it used to use: this is also the first thing I am proud of in my life.

After that, I became invincible and supreme all over the north and south of the Yangtze River.

My journey is boundless, and I take the four seas as my home. It's really like "Ping Zong Xia Ji (萍蹤侠影, a martial arts novel)" wandering around. I have been a parasite in a wallet like a bulging frog's belly, and I have also hidden in women's handbags, and temporarily traveled with lipsticks, scented paper, powder boxes, fountain pens, diaries - I have also been to various pockets and been a noble guest...

Because; I am often being transferred from these two hands to those two hands, so I have experienced all kinds of handshakes, those rough, greasy, with bright nail polish on the fingers, and with strong Langtry perfume in the palms... I have all kissed them.

However, experience tells me that whenever some delicate, white, soft, and slender hands hold me, they are always so careless and casual, as if inadvertently. Only those rough and dirty hands, short and clumsy, when holding me, it seems that they have given all their strength to their fingers, pinching me tightly, as if afraid that I will escape, that kind of disgusting look, every time, I always curse it hatefully.

Because of frequent contact with the eyes of the people who fall on me, I have experienced many types of them: rude, gentle, charming,... but they all have a kind of sharp and greedy look like a hunting dog - everyone wants to possess me, grab me.

I often buy smiles and sweet kisses for people, and I also bring extravagant material enjoyment and spiritual pleasure to some hedonists. But, because of me, people will also lose their most precious time and spirit. The pure reason is drowned, and the bright future is destroyed. I also try my best to pour the bitter wine of annoyance and pain into them, but they don't blame my cruelty, in fact, it's their "self-inflicted"!"

The humans I have seen are absolutely selfish. For me, they are mutually hostile and attacking, and they have lost their sincere friendship. Some, however, are because of my co-optation, and on the surface, everyone pretends to be hypocritical, you coax me, why can't I coax you? I control the emotions of human beings! I dominate the dynamics of human beings!

People in the world. Whoever can possess a large amount of me can get the respect and admiration of other human beings. Behind him, there will also be many people following him enthusiastically. If he says, "The sun has no light," those people will also say, "Yes! The sun has no light." If he says again, "Nonsense! The sun has light," those people will immediately say, "Yes! The sun has light."

If he smokes a cigar, there will be many people rushing to strike a match, often because of grabbing the match, they open their ugly heads to each other - this is the prestige of a person with money.

Because people with money can get such glory (?), so many people are planning all day and all night, trying to obtain a sum of money as great as an astronomical number, so the world will never be quiet again.

In this way, then I have become the chief culprit in poisoning the souls of human beings, but in fact, isn't it those mediocre people who are disturbing themselves?

Don't despise me because of my current rotten appearance! I am a hero who has been through hundreds of battles! Now I still have a strong force that can threaten some people who are gasping under the burden of life! Don't believe it? That's up to you.

### Winter Cold of the Curtain

— Huang Tingduo

Who killed this innocent little soul?

Unexpectedly, the tender green years passed away quietly,

Like the decline of an ancient tree of thousands of years!

Unexpectedly, the loving mother's hope disappeared in the midst of sad sorrow!

Where is their lost lovely hometown?

I saw the shadows of the two of them in the alley half a year ago;

Alas! Because of the death of her husband and the destruction of her family, she was forced to become a traveler in the world!

Who among the passersby has ever thought of this tragic scene in the world?

The continuous snowflakes fell sharply last night,

In the middle of the night, suddenly there was a burst of crying, the sound of a high chant

Shattering the desolation and silence of the streets?

Heartbreaking night! Where is your comfort?

Sure enough, this poor little soul quietly left his mother,

No longer sharing the joys and sorrows of the world!

This time, the east revealed a bleak sunlight,

Staring at the vast white snow and leaving a deep sorrow!

The earth was lazily bored and tired,

Frozen drowsiness;

Cold ducks on the roof croaked in tragic and poignant tones!

The cold wind blew away her tear-filled eyes with the sunlight!

### Mr. Feng Got a Raise

— Yu Huairui

In his forties, of medium build, he always walks slowly and methodically. When he meets people, he always squints, with a smile on the corner of his mouth, and nods: "Hehe... Hello." This person is Feng Zhizhai, a "clerk" in a foreign company. Because of his long history of residence and his amiable way of dealing with people, almost everyone in Wender Lane knows him, and everyone respectfully calls him "Mr. Feng."

In the past, Mr. Feng also had a glorious history. At that time, he could be said to be the only role model in Wender Lane, the object of worship and admiration of all residents in the lane. When someone complains about the shortcomings of others, they always like to bring out his advantages for comparison. When women scold their husbands, they always say: "A useless good-for-nothing, drinking yellow soup and gambling all day long, don't you look at Mr. Feng, he neither drinks nor gambles, and he is so kind, you, this useless thing, it would be good if you could reach one of his hairs." When elderly old ladies quarrel with their sons and daughters-in-law, they also shout in a hoarse voice: "You are a pair of incompatible couples, who don't know what sins you have committed in your previous life, you make so much noise every few days, you are not afraid of people laughing behind your backs, don't you look at Mr. Feng, the two of them are always respectful and polite, and have never had a harsh word, only you two precious things..." Even when children ask their parents to buy toys or candy, they will also imitate their elders: "Ying'er in Mr. Feng's family, his father bought it for him a long time ago, why don't I have it?"

Mr. Feng's ability to gain such a reputation is not a fluke. It is the natural result of the convergence of rivers, the convergence of his daily actions. He not only has no bad habits such as prostitution and gambling, but even does not smoke or drink, which are almost considered daily necessities. He also has a considerable salary income every month, enough to maintain the stable life of a family of three, so if the four words "gentleman" are not interpreted in the opposite sense, then he can be worthy of it. Moreover, his wife is also a virtuous woman, helping him manage the housework in an orderly manner. His only hobby is to take his wife and children to the park or watch a movie on weekends or holidays, on the one hand, to entertain himself, and at the same time, to reward his wife who is busy all day: and his wife also prepares some more exquisite dishes on that day as the enjoyment of her hardworking husband. They care for each other and comfort each other, and the whole family is filled with a harmonious and cheerful atmosphere, no wonder the neighbors are so envious and admire him.

But all of this has become a thing of the past. Now when I think about it, only a vague outline remains, like a beautiful flower buried in heavy fog!

The light burden of life in the past has become heavier and heavier in recent years due to the soaring prices of everything, like Sun Wukong in "Journey to the West" carrying the incarnation of the Red Boy, making Mr. Feng, who has always lived a leisurely life, almost unable to breathe. Although parks, movies, and delicacies have long been given up, and all expenses have been saved as much as possible, they still often struggle to make ends meet even at the lowest level of life; his wife is virtuous, and she has not said half a word of complaint, but from her melancholy eyes and the unintentional revelation in her tone of envy for those heroes - nouveau riches - who have made a fortune by relying on the times, it can be seen that she is also quite unhappy with the current situation in her heart. His wife is the person he usually respects and loves, and seeing her in this sad and lonely situation, of course, makes Mr. Feng feel like he is sitting on pins and needles all day long, and his heart is filled with guilt, anxiety, and anxiety.

It is already the weather of early summer, and the sun has lost the warmth and kindness of spring, and shining on people only increases the feeling of dryness and heat.

Like usual, Mr. Feng slowly stepped on his way home from the "office". Because he was still wearing a lined shirt, he felt particularly dry and hot, and beads of sweat seeped out from his forehead and the tip of his nose. Looking at the people walking past him, many of them were already wearing "Palis" long gowns. This made him realize that his lined shirt was no longer in season, and at the same time, a general feeling of poverty struck his heart. He couldn't help but whisper to himself, "It's time to wear a single shirt."

Thinking of the single shirt, he couldn't help but think of that silk gown with frayed sleeves and collar, and holes in the hem. "No matter what, I can't wear it again!" he shouted secretly in his heart. He should have replaced it with a new one last year, but because the material was expensive, he had been delaying it, but this year he couldn't delay it any longer.

Thinking of this, he gently pressed his pocket, where he had hidden the salary he had received today, a stack of not very thin banknotes - five hundred and twenty yuan. "It's a hundred and twenty yuan more than last month," the joy in his heart immediately turned into a smile on the corner of his mouth. He was thinking in his heart: "The salary increased this month will first be used to buy a long gown. This money is really not enough to make a new one, but fortunately, I have always been careless about clothes. If I go to the clothing store to pick up cheaper old clothes, it will definitely be much cheaper. In this way, the difference is probably limited. Although I will inevitably be a little tight next month, it will be fine; according to the settlement this month, as long as there is an income of more than five hundred yuan per month, not only will I not have to run into deficits again, but if I can save everywhere, there may be some surplus. Although the amount is extremely small, even a small amount of sand can make a tower. If I continue like this, can't I gradually restore the happy life I had before?" Thinking of this, Mr. Feng really felt extremely happy. The sun shining in front of him was emitting dazzling and brilliant light, and he thought, "Isn't this a symbol that I am stepping closer to the light?" So the joyful smile floated on the corner of his mouth again.

When he got home, Ying'er was playing silently by himself. When he saw his father, he rushed to him like a swallow, muttering, "Dad, have you collected your salary? What about the wooden horse you promised to buy me?"

"If I promised you, of course I'll buy it for you. It's too late today, I'll buy it for you in a few days." Because his heart was filled with joy, his tone was more gentle than usual.

His wife knew that he had gotten a raise, and she was also greatly pleased. Needless to say, they had a very sweet dinner that night.

But this perfect budget gradually collapsed as the days went by. Every night when he took notes, Mr. Feng deeply felt this: "Coal briquettes have risen by seven yuan per dan, flour has more than doubled, cooking oil has risen two times, soy sauce has risen by two-thirds, vegetables have risen... soap has risen... sugar has risen!..." A month passed, the budgeted long gown was not worn, but the threadbare shirt was sent to the high counter of the Changsheng pawnshop.

"Dad, what about the wooden horse you promised me?" Ying'er's daily request, disappointed that his father did not keep his promise, has gradually faded recently.

### Hunger

— Wan Li

—A Real Tragedy in the Henan Province Drought—

I shed reluctant,

compassionate hot tears,

when a friend told me

of the perilous tragedy there.

Desolate wilderness,

populated by ravaged,

exposed, starving corpses.

The devil's manipulation

has made the barren land

by the Yellow River in Central China

suffer an unprecedented

calamity in history!

The ravages of the god of war,

followed by

terrible disasters,

descend upon the world.

Tens of millions of pitiful compatriots

utter their last,

hungry cries,

Save us!

Barren land.

Rampage of natural disasters,

innocent people,

sadly perish.

In a dilapidated hut,

live two dying,

skull-like victims.

A mother with a loving heart,

and a pitiful child!

Innocent, naive,

lively child,

transformed into a jackal-like skeleton!

Years of constant,

inhumane life,

have caused the hardworking farmers

to lose the joys of the past.

Disasters have caused,

the people's

displacement,

families destroyed,

living in misery.

The child's father is gone!

To survive,

he abandoned his paternal

responsibility,

the haggard grandfather,

unable to withstand the scorching heat,

left his sorrowful life,

and began his grieving long sleep!

Fleeing!

Death!

Waiting for rescue!

Grass roots,

tree bark,

are the panacea to relieve hunger!

Mom! Mom!

Hungry! Hungry!

I... hungry...

Everywhere are groans and laments!

Hunger drives

rational human beings

to cannibalize their brethren!

Horrible!

A neighbor proposed to her

to exchange children!

She refused.

Mother!

The most loving person in the world!

She refused!

Love cannot solve

the severe hunger.

The result of the refusal is

disappointment and pain.

What is seen,

is the starvation in the whole village!

What is heard,

is the adversity at the final moment!

Death is the only destination,

unable to die,

and unable to live.

Human tragedies are forced

to happen!

On a certain day,

the morning sun

shines brightly on two

tightly embraced corpses,

they - mother and child -

in the loving mother's hand,

held a blood-stained knife,

stabbing it into the child's throat!

Dead!

Died without a sound.

As if the earth has lost

a tiny mouse!
