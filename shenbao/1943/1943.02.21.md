### On the European Situation

Currently, the focal points of the world war are in the East, with the operations in the Pacific, and in the West, with Europe, particularly the Soviet Union battlefield. The Red Army's winter counteroffensive, in addition to being demonstrated by the lifting of the siege of Stalingrad, further resulted in the retreat of German forces from the Caucasus, Kursk, and Rostov. Although we are not military experts and cannot offer accurate assessments, judging from the speech given on the 18th of this month by German Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, the severity of the European situation cannot be denied. Goebbels pointed out: "The Battle of Stalingrad is indeed the greatest warning to the German people. The lessons of this winter war should have awakened the European people from their delusions. The Bolshevik rulers, with their strict methods, concealed their national conditions, which led us to fail to make an accurate assessment of their combat potential at the beginning of the war. Now, the enormity of their combat power has been revealed, so we must now engage them with the strength of the entire nation." He also specifically and solemnly pointed out the following: namely, "(1) If the German army fails to conquer this crisis, then Germany and Europe will successively be ravaged by Bolshevism; (2) But Germany is now fighting alongside its allies and does indeed have the power to save Europe from this crisis; (3) Now that the crisis is imminent, we must recognize reality and deal with it effectively." Extrapolating from his speech, the aim is to awaken the German people from their dream of a swift victory and promote greater efforts by Germany; and even more meaningfully, it is to awaken the people of neutral countries and anti-Axis countries such as Britain and the United States, so that they can recognize reality and switch to Germany's anti-Bolshevik front. Therefore, Goebbels pointed out with deep sorrow: If the world's strongest military power, Germany, cannot conquer this red peril, then what country in the world can bear this difficult task? The current neutral countries in Europe do not have the power to resist even slightly; Soviet mechanized units can ravage various countries within a few days. If Europe truly falls into the hands of the Soviet Union, then Britain and the United States will also be powerless. Moreover, "at that time, London cannot guarantee that it will only remain in Europe and will not cross the Channel." It is very clear that this is to awaken the neutral countries of Europe and the countries of Britain and the United States. However, if these words are hastily mistaken to mean that Germany has already encountered a fatal blow in its war against the Soviet Union, and that the European war will immediately undergo astonishing changes, this would of course be a great mistake. Today, on the one hand, we must recognize reality and recognize that the Red Army's winter counteroffensive has already created a new situation in the European war. This situation will force the neutral countries of Europe to decide their own paths, and it will also force Britain and the United States to reconsider their future actions. As for the current task of the Axis countries, it is to cooperate more closely, concentrate all the forces that can be mobilized, and prepare for the decisive battle when spring and summer come. On the other hand, we must also estimate the actual situation on the side of the anti-Axis countries: First, to what extent will military cooperation between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union develop? Can Britain and the United States trust the Soviet Union to stop before the borders of Germany and continue to cooperate? Do Britain and the United States have the strength to take advantage of the new situation created by the winter war and further open the so-called second front in Southeastern Europe, the Mediterranean, and the West? And will neutral countries make decisive new decisions in light of the new situation? These questions are all questions that will determine the future course of the war. Only from the study of these questions, coupled with an accurate estimate of the new forces that Germany and the Soviet Union may be able to mobilize, can we more accurately grasp the future of the European war situation.

The German authorities do not shy away from the adverse trends in the winter war and the "enormous combat power of the Soviet Union" that has already been "revealed," but the German side clearly has not been discouraged. As Goebbels said in his speech on the 18th: "Today's Germany, everyone has no thought of compromise, and the entire people have embraced the will to fight hard... We must exterminate it and never give up halfway; this is the duty that National Socialism should fulfill. Now that the war has developed to its highest point, Germany will never waver in its fighting spirit and will definitely end this war with victory." And the way for Germany to win is through the increased efforts of the German people. This point is fully expressed in the questions that Goebbels raised to the people during his speech: "Do you deeply believe that we will obtain final victory? Are you determined to go through fire and water, following the Führer? If the Führer demands that you work fourteen to sixteen hours a day, are you willing to obey? Is your faith in the Führer even stronger than before? Do you support cracking down on those who loaf on the job?" The positive and affirmative answers to these questions have a decisive significance for Germany's final victory. Therefore, he asked his people: "You should only think about the war and not think about anything else... During full mobilization, all luxury facilities should be closed down." But as he said, "Today's crisis is not only suffered by Germany alone; all of Europe is suffering it," so he cannot but demand that the resources of Germany and German-controlled Europe must be thoroughly developed. At the same time, "The German people are sacrificing their flesh and blood to protect Europe, and Europe should also exchange labor. We don't need to discuss whether the methods we use are good or bad; we should only discuss whether they are successful."

However, when we talk about the European war situation, there is still one point that absolutely cannot be ignored: due to the international nature of modern world war, the war in Europe is closely related to the war in East Asia. To estimate the future of the European war situation, we must also estimate the existence of this situation on the East Asian battlefield, so that the enormous combat power of Britain and the United States cannot be completely used in the war against Europe. The second European front, which has been shouted for more than a year, cannot be opened up. In addition to the suspicion and disloyalty of Britain and the United States towards the Soviet Union, the heavy blows of the East Asian war to Britain and the United States are indeed one of the most important reasons. At a time when the so-called "Four-Power Conference" of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is strengthening its "counteroffensive" plan, the accurate maintenance of Japan's offensive in the Pacific cannot but be said to be Germany's strongest aid. And Japan's further actions in the future will naturally be another important factor in determining the European war situation. The statements of the relevant responsible authorities in Japan in recent days, as well as the establishment and promotion of China's wartime political, economic, and military policies, all show how great a force East Asia is exerting on the world war situation.

Translated Commentary

### The Astonishing Results of the South Pacific War

According to the announcement of the Japanese General Headquarters, the necessary foundation for the Japanese army to conduct new operations in the South Pacific has been consolidated. The war in this area can be said to have entered a new stage. One of the conclusions of the previous stage of the war is that the Imperial Navy's war results in this area that have not been announced in the past half-year were announced by the General Headquarters on the evening of the 13th, totaling: 16 ships sunk and damaged, 237 aircraft shot down, and 10 ships sunk and damaged. During the same period, the damage to enemy forces by the Japanese naval forces, which has been confirmed, totaled: 6 battleships sunk, 4 damaged, other ships 6124, 1074 aircraft, and more than 30 ships. Here, they all prove how admirable the military power of the Japanese army is. Although Britain and the United States call themselves "great powers," from the numbers, we can infer the great consumption of combat power. What will their leaders think when they see this?

Especially after the disastrous defeat in the initial battles, the panicked Britain and the United States took extremely bleak and cautious measures to deal with this situation, trying their best to hide the truth of the damage from the people. However, the subsequent damage was even greater than the blows suffered in the initial battles, and there is no room for concealment now. What enemy leaders fear most is the exposure of reality. Therefore, they create empty rhetoric in order to boost the morale of the people, but the seams are often attached to false treasures. Roosevelt once said, "We will attack from this island to that island and defeat Japan." Navy Secretary Knox also said, "We will take back the islands of the Pacific one by one and do not want to attack Tokyo." Both are dreaming. No matter what method the enemy uses, we are not afraid. If they come from the South Pacific, the pain they suffered in the previous stage will definitely be seen again in the next stage of the war!

### German and Italian Forces Occupy Bīxióng; British and American Forces Retreat Southward; German Forces in Tunisia Recapture 4,000 Square Miles of Land in Four Days

Havas Agency Dispatch from the capital of Switzerland, the 19th: According to news from the Axis and British and American sides, the Italian and German forces in southern Tunisia continue to make progress and have reached the vicinity of the Weifa grassland, within 15 miles of the Algerian border! The Allied side admits that the Axis forces have achieved their goal of expanding the gap between the British Eighth Army and the First Army. Bīxióng, the weakest point in the Allied defense line (25 miles west of Kairoan), has almost fallen into German hands. The remnants of the Allied forces have retreated south from the Duc district in Bīxióng. The Berlin Radio Station claims that the German and Italian Allied forces have retreated from the mountainous area at the southern end of the White Horse Sz Line. The British Eighth Army continues to attack the outposts on the southern flank of General Rommel's troops. After fierce fighting in the mountains, the German and Italian Allied forces retreated to their main positions with lightning speed. The war continues on the southern flank of the Axis forces, but the British Desert Division has not yet engaged in combat with the main force of General Rommel's troops. It is heard that most of the Mareth Line is defended by Italian troops. The line is protected by three dry riverbeds. The French built solid fortifications here before the war, and it can only be threatened from the direction of Gafsa. After occupying Gafsa, this threat has been eliminated. The Axis forces have laid a large minefield between Bèngjiā Nà and Huá Dí Mǎlèsī. The Mareth Line also has the advantage of connecting with the rest of Tunisia by rail. The remnants of the American army are trying to stop the German advance in the mountains southeast of Tébessa in order to retreat southward and take cover in the deep mountains. As of now, the number of American prisoners has reached 3,000. The German army has captured a large number of tanks and military equipment. The American side admits that the number of American tanks that have fallen into the hands of the Axis forces is more than enough to compensate for the losses of the Axis forces in the last few days of the war in Tunisia. The Axis forces now occupy the main position southeast of the Atlas Mountains, and the American army is retreating on all fronts. At the same time, the Allied war report in North Africa claims that there are not many battles in southern Tunisia. Allied aircraft bombed various targets in Fériana and the northern road. The British Eighth Army has completed the occupation of the Gabès Island near the coast of Tunisia. In addition, the Axis air force is also very active in Tunisia, shooting down several Allied aircraft in one day. It is said that the Axis torpedo planes have struck enemy convoys in the Mediterranean, hitting four enemy ships, two of which sank. The damaged ones are one light cruiser and one 10,000-ton transport ship. Both London and Washington are extremely anxious about the development of the Tunisian front. The London Times frankly admits that the Allied forces in Tunisia have been greatly weakened and that a thorough reorganization of the Allied forces in North Africa is urgently needed.

German Forces Reach the Algerian Border

Alliance News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, the 20th: According to news received here last night from the Axis and Allied sides, the Axis forces led by German General Arnim are expanding their victories after winning in Gafsa and Fait in Tunisia and are driving the American army out of the southeastern area of the Atlas Mountains, rapidly approaching the Algerian border. News from Berlin said that the American army had fled on a broad front, and the Axis vanguard had crossed the railway from Sbeitla to Floriana and reached the foothills of the Atlas Mountains southeast of Tébessa (Note: Tébessa is outside the Algerian border). This statement has been confirmed by the Reuters correspondent on the Tunisian front, who reported last night that the Axis forces had advanced in the far south and reached the Nafte grassland within 15 miles of the Algerian border. "Today's News" believes that Bīxióng, the weakest point in the Allied mountain defense line, is in the hands of the German army. Bīxióng is 15 miles west of Kairoan, and the French army has retreated from the Duc district south of Bīxióng to the ridge on the west side of the Oseltia Valley. Furthermore, according to news from Berlin, the American war zone has been breached extensively. On Thursday, an American infantry brigade flanked in the Chiraipud district to block the advance of the German and Italian vanguard, but was repulsed. The Axis forces have captured 3,000 enemy soldiers so far and seized a large number of tanks and cars. In addition, they have destroyed 169 enemy tanks, 95 trucks, 102 cannons, and many transport vehicles. A British division has now been transferred from the north to reinforce the American army in the south. At the same time, on the border between Tunisia and Tripolitania, the British Eighth Army infantry, assisted by heavy artillery, attacked the German outposts on Thursday. According to news from Berlin, fierce fighting is taking place on the southern side of the Axis forces. The Axis outposts have retreated into the main position, but the British army has not yet made contact with the main force of the German army.

Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, the 20th: U.S. Secretary of War Stimson's announcement regarding the losses of the American army in Tunisia is said to be 3,333 killed in action, 6,500 wounded, 6,132 captured, and 115,684 missing. We have no way of knowing the truth of these numbers. All we know is the number of prisoners. As for the huge number of missing, it can be seen that many American transport ships have been sunk. Stimson also said that the Axis forces in Tunisia now outnumber the Allied forces.

Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, the 20th: A New York dispatch said that the New York Herald Tribune reported yesterday that Rommel has begun to use his disintegration tactics again. Rommel, after defeating the American air force, eliminated the threat to the rear of the Mareth Line and made it impossible for the Allied forces to counterattack.

Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, the 20th: According to a dispatch from Algiers, the anti-Axis command announced on the 19th: 1. The American army was fiercely attacked by a German mechanized division and retreated to a place more than 100 kilometers from the Algerian border. 2. Led by 50-ton heavy tanks, the German army recaptured 4,000 square miles of territory in four days. The American army suffered heavy losses in both manpower and material resources.

Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, the 20th: According to news from the Reuters front correspondent in Algiers, the French rebel army also retreated from the Fu'en Ge area in central Tunisia on the 19th, southward towards the Oseltia Valley south of Bīxióng.

Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Rome, the 20th: According to news from here, the Tunisian governor sent his prime minister to Kairoan to express his condolences to the residents who suffered from the British and American air raids on the city. He also donated 90,000 francs as a relief fund.

America's Defeat Alarms Britain

Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Stockholm, the 20th: The British were greatly alarmed after learning of the defeat of the American army in Tunisia, believing that the meeting of the British forces in Tunisia, both north and south, would become more difficult, and that the difficulties faced by General Montgomery's troops would be even greater. Although the London authorities have remained silent on the defeat of the American army, the general feeling is quite indignant. Clement Davies, a Liberal member of Parliament, wrote in the News Chronicle, accusing the Americans of being fools and advocating that American generals and officers should receive more training.

Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Stockholm, the 20th: "The Swedish Daily News London correspondent said that London is increasingly uneasy about the situation in Tunisia. Although British military figures believe that the American army can stop the continued advance of the Axis forces, they have to admit that the loss of three important airfields is a heavy blow to the Allied forces. If the Allies want to avoid further setbacks, the British army should come to the aid of the American army." In the eyes of the British Observer, the final victory in the Tunisian war must belong to the Allies, but the British newspapers believe that the war has a tendency to prolong and cannot be ended in a short period of time. The London correspondent of the Swedish "Daily News" said that, according to British opinions, Marshal Rommel has achieved three goals in the recent war: (1) He shattered the Allied plan to cut off the Axis retreat route; (2) The Allied attempt to use Tunisia as a springboard to launch a new offensive could not be realized; (3) He cut off the connection between the British First Army and the Eighth Army, putting the Allied forces in a disadvantageous position.

### In the Nantong Area, the Japanese Army Attacks the New Fourth Army, Killing More Than 150 People

Central News Agency Dispatch from Shanghai: A certain unit of the Japanese army, in order to respond to the encirclement and annihilation war launched against the Eighth Ninth Army of the Chongqing army, began to advance northward towards Nantong on the 17th and encountered about 500 men of the New Fourth Army. After two hours of fierce fighting, most of them were annihilated. In this battle, 158 corpses of the Communist army were buried, 89 prisoners were captured, and 1 heavy machine gun, 2 light machine guns, 72 rifles, 1,300 rounds of ammunition, 1 pistol, and many other military supplies were seized.

Central News Agency Dispatch from Shanghai: After the National Government announced its participation in the war, it actively cooperated with the Japanese army to establish a total mobilization posture between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, and blockaded Chongqing, accelerating the collapse of its war economy. Recently, the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, in order to cooperate with the National Government's army to overthrow the Chongqing regime, has launched a spring offensive. It began operations in the Suhuai area on the 13th. With the cooperation of the Chinese and Japanese armies, it has defeated the main force of the Chongqing Eighth Ninth Army entrenched in the area. Then it turned to attack the main force of the Third Division of the New Fourth Army in northern Jiangsu, which continued to be active centering on Fùníng, inflicting heavy damage on it. The significance of this operation lies in preemptively stopping the Chongqing army's actions in order to expand the peace zone. At the same time, the Japanese army in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River started operations from Shashi and Nanchang, fiercely attacking the Chongqing army in the Ninth and Sixth war zones, launching a two-front war and severely damaging the Chongqing direct army, which boasted of being a model division. In addition, Japanese aircraft have repeatedly bombed Guilin, Liuzhou, and Hengyang Chongqing air bases since the beginning of the new year. The air force and base facilities on which Chongqing relied have been destroyed by Japanese aircraft. This has a very profound impact on Chongqing in both material and psychological terms. Moreover, the National Government's army fought side by side with the Japanese army in the Suhuai area, which fully demonstrates the spirit of shared destiny between China and Japan.

### Roosevelt Says Aid to Chongqing Is Difficult

Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, the 20th: According to a dispatch from Washington, Roosevelt and Soong Mei-ling met with a group of reporters on the 19th. Soong Mei-ling once again pleaded with the United States to strengthen aid to Chongqing. In response, Roosevelt said that the US government is also willing to send military supplies to Chongqing, but the problem is transportation is difficult. At present, there is no other way except for air transport. Transport aircraft must carry as much gasoline as possible back and forth between China and US bases in the South Pacific. From a geographical point of view, it is clear how difficult it is to aid Chongqing.

### The US Weapons Lend-Lease Bureau Sets Up a China Section; Aid to the Soviet Union Slightly Increases Compared to Before

Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, the 19th: According to a dispatch from Washington, US Weapons Lend-Lease Bureau Director Stettinius announced on the 18th that a new China section has been set up within the bureau. The first director is Mr. Ray. On the 18th, Mr. Ray met with a group of reporters and made a statement as follows: 50% of the materials that the United States lends to Chongqing are currently placed in India due to transportation difficulties. Since the closure of the Burma Road, the only way to transport materials to Chongqing is by using airplanes.

Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, the 20th: According to a dispatch from Washington, although Chongqing has repeatedly asked the United States to strengthen aid, it has not yet been realized. At a time when the dark clouds between the United States and Chongqing have not cleared, US Weapons Lend-Lease Bureau Director Stettinius suddenly announced on the 19th that US aid to the Soviet Union is increasing every month. The main points of his statement are recorded below: US material aid to the Soviet Union increased by 10% in January of this year compared to December of last year. A large amount of materials will continue to be transported every month in the future. Since the implementation of the Lend-Lease Act, the United States has supplied the Soviet Union with a total of 2.9 million tons of military supplies, two-thirds of which were transported by US ships.

### After the Governor-General's Administration: An Overview of Hong Kong's Construction - Establishing a New Economic System in Hong Kong - Rapid Development of Various Industries

Hong Kong, 20th (Central News Agency) - It has been a year since the Governor-General's Office of Occupied Hong Kong began its administration on February 20th of last year. During this year, thanks to the efforts of the Governor-General's Office, a new economic system has been established in Hong Kong. Moreover, due to the effective implementation of controlled economy, Hong Kong's industries have achieved rapid development. As we enter the second year of construction, we will summarize the current situation and future prospects of the main sectors of Hong Kong's construction as follows:

(1) Trade

Hong Kong's position in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is extremely important. It is currently recognized as a distribution port for the sphere. To facilitate Hong Kong shipping companies, the Governor-General's Office has lent a portion of its warehouses to eight shipping companies in Hong Kong for loading and unloading cargo at the docks. These eight companies established a stevedoring and warehousing company on the 18th of this month, aiming to maximize the function of the distribution port. Furthermore, an important part of Hong Kong's trade involves processing raw materials produced in the South and then exporting them. For example, according to the trade agreement established with the Philippines last October, large quantities of sugar, tobacco, and Manila hemp were imported, processed by local factories, and then re-exported to the South. Therefore, thanks to the efforts of various industrial sectors, Hong Kong's trade scope with Southeast Asia and China has been increasingly expanding. Recently, trade settlement methods have been determined with the South and various parts of the Mainland, namely (A) trade with Shonan (Singapore) and the Philippines will be settled using a special method, (B) trade with North China and Manchuria will be settled in Tokyo, and (C) trade with Central China will be settled using military scrip. After these settlement methods are determined, Hong Kong's trade with various regions will become more stable and smooth.

(2) Shipbuilding

Maritime Transport: Hong Kong's shipbuilding facilities are among the best in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. After the Japanese army occupied it, they immediately began restoration. The construction and repair of ships is progressing extremely smoothly, especially the construction of wooden motorized junks. To enhance Hong Kong's transport capacity, these wooden motorized junks are now being used for the transportation of materials between Hong Kong and the South. Sailing junks and wooden boats are also being utilized as a major supplement to local transportation. The owners of these sailing junks have now formed a Sailing Junk Transportation Association, specializing in coastal transport. Currently, regular sailing routes have begun from the islands under the jurisdiction of Occupied Hong Kong to Jiangmen, Taipingmen at the mouth of the Pearl River, as well as Shantou and Guangzhou Bay.

(3) Industry

Hong Kong's important industries include refrigeration, cigarette manufacturing, hydrochloric acid, dyes, nail manufacturing, beverages, beer, sugar refining, cement, hydrochloric acid, etc. Currently, they are all resuming operations under the management of the Governor-General's Office. The Governor-General's Office has also decided to soon return these factories to private management. Over 700 small factories run by Chinese that have been permitted to resume operations, mostly manufacturing textiles, food products, and miscellaneous goods, will soon begin operations. To promote the prosperity of Chinese residents, the Governor-General's Office has decided to provide as much convenience as possible.

(4) Finance

The Governor-General's Office promulgated the currency and exchange regulations for Occupied Hong Kong last July, with the intention of restricting enemy Hong Kong currency and strengthening the use of military scrip. This February, the military scrip exchange has expanded the exchange limit for Hong Kong currency from 200 yuan to 1,000 yuan, to facilitate the circulation of military scrip. The Governor-General's Office, recognizing the large number of people relying on Hong Kong currency for their livelihood, has made it clear that it will maintain the current . Twenty Chinese banks in Hong Kong have also resumed operations. The Governor-General's Office is now working to restore Chinese-run banks to normal operation as soon as possible, and the restriction on deposits will be lifted by the end of February or early March.

(5) Population

Question: The Governor-General's Office is now vigorously encouraging Chinese residents to return to their hometowns and providing them with convenient transportation. Approximately 900,000 people have already been evacuated from Hong Kong, and following recent consultations with the Guangdong authorities, effective promotion methods will be implemented starting in March. However, this return to hometowns is not only for population management but also based on the viewpoint of re-rationally distributing Hong Kong and Guangdong. Every effort will be made to ensure that returning people can live and work in peace and contentment, which will also greatly benefit agricultural production in South China.

### German Troops West of Kharkov Adopt Effective Defensive Warfare - Fierce Fighting Continues in the Donets Basin - Soviet Troops in Poltava Repelled

Stockholm, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to Eastern Front news, German troops west of Rostov have established fortified positions in the area of Matveyev Kurgan, 30 kilometers north of the important Sea of Azov port of Taganrog, to intercept the southward-moving Soviet troops. Fierce fighting is currently underway between the two armies. Furthermore, Soviet troops under General Malinovsky, attempting to engage the German troops in a decisive battle in the Don River estuary area, are continuously reinforcing with reserve forces, aiming to break through the German positions with a pincer attack. Due to the Soviet troops' day and night attacks, the German troops' operations seem quite difficult. According to news received on the afternoon of the 17th, the German troops are still firmly defending their original positions and have stopped the Soviet advance, but the situation is not necessarily optimistic. In the southern coalfield area of Voroshilovgrad, tank battles have occurred between German and Soviet troops in several locations. The terrain is muddy, making operations quite difficult.

Berlin, 20th (Domei) - Military sources here stated last night that German troops west of Kharkov have adopted effective defensive warfare to stop the Soviet advance. Fierce fighting continued on Thursday and yesterday in the Donets Basin to the south. The main combat zone currently extends from the Kursk northern area to Novorossiysk along the entire southern front. However, Soviet troops in the Leningrad, Volkhov, and Lake Ilmen areas on the northwestern front have also launched repeated attacks. After German troops adopted a systematic action from Voroshilovgrad and Rostov to shorten the lines, Soviet troops exerted strong pressure in the Donets Basin. German troops are resisting and attacking at the same time, inflicting heavy damage on Soviet troops. Fierce battles are currently taking place west of Kharkov. Soviet troops attempted to advance towards Poltava but were repelled by German troops. Southwest of Kharkov, Soviet troops attacked with the aim of advancing towards the great bend of the Dnieper River but were defeated by German troops. German sources emphasized that Soviet troops did not make any progress in this area on Thursday but admitted that the Soviet commander has amassed significant forces, preparing to flank Kursk. North of Kursk, Soviet troops again attacked Orel on Thursday. German troops straightened the lines in several locations in the Livny area northeast of Kursk, thwarting the Soviet attempt to break through the German positions from the south of the salient. In the northwest Caucasus, on the Taman Peninsula, several Soviet units were annihilated. The German counterattack in Novorossiysk is tightening the encirclement of a Soviet force that recently landed in the area. Furthermore, German sources claim that the Soviet offensive on the northwestern front has not , resulting in losses of fourteen tanks and twenty-five aircraft. The Spanish Blue Division on the Leningrad front repelled the Soviet attack. The Soviet offensive on Volkhov was also defeated by German troops. South of Lake Ilmen, the Soviet invasion of the German defensive positions also collapsed. Further north, German-Finnish forces in the Kandalaksha area are encircling a Soviet unit and are currently in the process of annihilation.

### German War Report

German Führer Headquarters, 20th (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command announced that German aircraft destroyed 38 aircraft and 32 tanks on the Eastern Front yesterday. The Soviet troops in the Kuban bridgehead are only conducting local attacks due to the melting ice and snow, without advancing . Fighting continues from the Sea of Azov to south of Orel. German troops are counterattacking in various locations, repelling Soviet troops and destroying tanks. A Soviet cavalry unit in the Donets River basin has been surrounded and will be annihilated. Soviet troops in the northern Don, assisted by artillery and tanks, attacked but have not succeeded. German aircraft are attacking Soviet supply lines day and night, shooting down thirty-eight Soviet aircraft. General Panzer Corps, in the Donets River basin, has achieved considerable military merit.

### Finnish War Report

Helsinki, 20th (Haitong News Agency) - The Finnish High Command announced that a Soviet reconnaissance unit was defeated in the Karelian Isthmus. A Soviet attempt to cross Lake Onega was also repelled. A Soviet aircraft attempted to approach Helsinki this morning but was repelled by anti-aircraft fire.

### Eastern European Residents Willing to Join the German Army - Berlin, 20th (Haitong News Agency)

Keishoff recently published an article in the "National Weekly" reviewing the situation in the occupied territories of Eastern Europe, stating that the people in that area deeply fear the repetition of Bolshevism. After Eastern Europe was occupied by German troops, a large number of residents requested the German command to allow them to join the German army and serve. Although the German command initially refused, given the earnestness of the requests, it was finally decided to give volunteers the opportunity to defend their homeland. This volunteer army includes Estonians, Lithuanians, Bessarabians, Western Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Russians, all of whom are good soldiers. They are especially brave in winter's harsh climate. They have their own uniforms and commanders, and receive the same treatment as German troops on the Eastern Front. Even the orphans and widows of those killed in action receive German pensions. In addition to this volunteer army, German troops often receive assistance from local residents, such as transporting supplies and constructing roads and bridges. German authorities do not interfere with the religious customs and lifestyles of the local residents.

### Japan Takes Cautious Steps in Implementing the Abolition of Extraterritoriality in China - Minister Aoki Stated in Response to Questions from Diet Members - The Japanese House of Representatives Passed the Revised Conscription Law in Plenary Session

Beijing, 20th (Haitong News Agency) - Japanese Embassy spokesman Kitazawa stated to reporters yesterday that the date for Japan's abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions has not yet been determined. On the European front, German troops are preparing for a spring or summer offensive, hence the voluntary withdrawal from Rostov and Kharkov.

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese House of Representatives held a plenary session this afternoon and passed seven bills, including the revised Conscription Law sent by the House of Peers. The House of Peers did not hold a plenary session today, only holding budget committees and various other committees in the morning and afternoon.

Tokyo, 20th (Domei) - Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki stated today in response to questions from Diet members during a meeting of the House of Representatives' North China Revitalization Committee that the entire issue of Japan's abolition of extraterritoriality in China is complex. Therefore, the specific methods for abolishing this right must be implemented cautiously and gradually. Japan's return of concessions and the abandonment of extraterritoriality have had a far-reaching impact on enhancing the status of the National Government and are steps towards completing China's complete independence. Japan is now implementing the principles of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty with active actions, providing the National Government with new capabilities to carry out its task of revitalizing China. The National Government has further strengthened its determination to cooperate closely with Japan and expand its political and economic power at this time.

### Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces the Sinking of Enemy Ships - Japanese Air Force Launches Aviation Annihilation Warfare - To Make the Fate of American Troops as Perilous as a Stack of Eggs

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese Army and Navy troops consolidated the foundation for new operations and withdrew from Guadalcanal Island, the United States still greatly publicized the strategic value of the island. The 30,000 American troops under Patch were assigned as the vanguard of the South Pacific counteroffensive against Japan, while efforts were made to actively replenish them. However, since the beginning of the year, the Japanese Naval Air Force has strengthened its forces in that area and launched aviation annihilation warfare, fleet annihilation warfare, and base attack warfare at any time, engaging in cutting off enemy supply lines. For example, on the 17th of this month, a fierce attack was launched on a large enemy transport convoy escorted by two destroyers southeast of the island, immediately sinking two enemy destroyers and one transport ship, shattering the enemy's attempt to supply the island. On that day, naval reconnaissance aircraft first discovered a large transport convoy about 70 nautical miles south of San Cristobal Island. The Japanese Naval Air Force then pursued north, beginning to bombard the enemy convoy in the airspace about 20 nautical miles east of San Cristobal Island, braving the enemy destroyers' intense anti-aircraft fire and repeatedly bombing them.

Japanese cruiser fleets are active on the seas of the South, destroying enemy fleets amidst towering waves.

### Japanese Minister to the Soviet Union Returns Home to Report

Tokyo, 20th (Domei) - Japanese Minister to the Soviet Union Morishima arrived at Tokyo Station this afternoon to report to central authorities and conduct consultations.

### Japanese Air Force Attacks Moresby

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to news arriving here, the Southwest Pacific counter-Axis command announced on the 20th that the Japanese Air Force again attacked Moresby on the 19th, heavily bombing the U.S. naval base. Harbor facilities were heavily damaged. The result was sinking two destroyers and one transport ship loaded with food, ammunition, etc. Other ships were also heavily damaged. As it was at night, it could not be confirmed. Three Japanese aircraft were also sacrificed. In the future, the Japanese Naval Air Force's operations to cut off the enemy's supply lines to Guadalcanal Island will be strengthened, and the island will become increasingly isolated, while the fate of the 30,000 American troops under Patch is like a candle in the wind, as perilous as a stack of eggs.

### Japanese Aircraft Appears Over Sydney

Lisbon, 20th (Domei) - According to reports from Sydney, Australia, a Japanese aircraft appeared over the skies of Sydney and Cabramatta last night, and an alert was immediately issued. Afterward, Australian Prime Minister Curtin warned that no part of Australia is safe. A Japanese aircraft flying from the sea arrived. When the Japanese aircraft flew to Sydney, the city's anti-aircraft guns opened fire but did not hit the Japanese aircraft, which flew into the sea. It is believed that the aircraft flew from a submarine. An aircraft was also sighted at Cabramatta, and an alert was immediately issued. According to official reports, "An enemy aircraft, clearly launched from a submarine, was detected last night, flying east towards the coast. Cabramatta immediately implemented a blackout. Subsequently, an aircraft was detected in the skies over Sydney, and a blackout was also implemented. An anti-aircraft battery immediately opened fire, and the aircraft turned around and flew out to sea."

### Japanese Education Policy Respects Southern National Traditions

Tokyo, 20th (Domei) - Director of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau, Major General Sato, stated yesterday during a meeting of the House of Representatives' Accounting Committee, in response to questions from Diet member Takeuchi, that Japan's education policy in the Southern regions will fully respect the traditions and character of the Southern nations and abolish the oppressive education system of Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands. An aircraft crashed during a test flight in Seattle, killing all twelve crew members, including the famous American aviator Allen.

### The Contents of Chongqing's "Price Control Bureau" - Daily Necessities Supply Stations Are Empty

— Jin Yan

The Chongqing regime, in order to ease the people's minds, established the Price Control Bureau under the "Ministry of Economics," touting the supply of daily necessities. However, the reality is completely different. There are no goods to buy, prices are not controlled, and they are not even across the board. See below a letter from Chongqing citizen Jiang Jingsheng appealing to the public:

"Amidst rising prices, the government, thinking of the people's interests, established the "Price Control Bureau," setting up many daily necessities supply stations in the Chongqing city area and expanding to the suburbs. Even in remote areas, there are branch stores. The goods sold are of many varieties. All of their retail outlets are bustling all day long. For a few months, the citizens did indeed enjoy considerable benefits. However, for the past year, their business has been steadily declining, and their inventory has been dwindling. Initially, except for a few special goods (such as wool yarn and toothpaste), which were genuinely limited due to too many monks and too little porridge, restrictions were imposed with scheduled times and various procedures, which was an unavoidable measure. Strictly speaking, in "daily necessities," "daily essentials," especially in "supply stations," such strange phenomena are not permissible! Since they are called "daily essentials," they should be purchased sufficiently to avoid shortages. Otherwise, what else can they be called other than "essentials," what kind of "supply station" would they be? They are simply "supply inspection stations"! However, their inventory is not thought to be purchased in large quantities. They have gradually adopted the method of "snatching." Now, even the most common soap and matches are being sold in this way. Often, only one or two items are sold around one o'clock in the afternoon, forcing the nearby citizens to use all their life's strength to grab a pack of matches, or a bar of soap, or a pack of cigarettes, or a towel. Usually, their shelves are empty, busy for only half an hour a day, and the rest of the time, male and female shop assistants are chatting, drinking tea, and reading newspapers... Logically, if the Price Control Bureau really wants to follow the plan and hang up a sign to provide welfare for the people, I think there would be no difficulty. The store's regular inventory may not be said to be fuller than the stores, but at least it will not be shorter than the stores, let alone make the entire store empty and the staff sit idle with nothing to sell, and nothing to do. But the fact is in front of us, they are neither "supplying" nor "responding." They have long lost the meaning of the word "supply." On Sunday, I walked from Shaanxi Street to Shangqingsi, traversing the entire city. I paid special attention to each supply station, and they were all equally "empty." The staff chattered "eloquently." So I instinctively thought, "Such supply stations, it is better to close them down!" "Continuing to open them, our people are too inappropriate!" Please estimate, how many stations are there in the city and countryside, how large are the daily expenses, raising so many idle people, doing nothing all day, how wasteful is this! Recently, Fushengzhuang has also opened many retail outlets, and the business is as good as the situation when the Daily Necessities Public Sale Office was first opened. It is said that they both belong to the Material Bureau of the Ministry of Economics. They were originally a family, and the supply stations are idle enough to do nothing. Why not entrust them as agents? What other reason is there to need independent portals, and more than one operating expense and recurring expense? I really do not understand, is this not sheer waste? Are we even allowing such wasteful things in this stage of financial difficulty? I really have some bones in my throat, and I have to speak out. If you cannot regularly supply goods, simply merge or close them down! If there are scattered items in the future, if you want to give them to the citizens, you can use the patrol team to go to the suburbs and sell them at any time. Or imitate the method of rural fairs, which is not impossible! Why play such jokes? With no "real goods" displayed, you still call it a supply station!" (Mailed December 28, 1942)

### Burmese Princes Support the Government - Rangoon, 20th (Central News Agency)

On the morning of the 18th, two Burmese men of extraordinary character visited Burmese Administrative Chief Ba Maw, who immediately received them. It was then learned that the two were Princes Tai Chin Uin and Gemani, descendants of the Ava Dynasty. In addition to expressing their congratulations on the impending restoration of sovereignty and the construction of a new nation, they also expressed their full support for the government under Japanese military administration. Chief Ba Maw expressed his deep gratitude and appreciation and stated that he would further strive for the construction of a new Burma. The main points of the two princes' conversation are recorded below: We, on behalf of the descendants of King Qi Bao, are willing to work for Burma, which has been granted the honor of nation-building by Japan. Burma, which has broken away from British domination due to Japan's great kindness, is now able to build a new nation with Japan's recognition, which is truly gratifying. The Burmese people are fully aware that they must unite and immediately strive to build a new Burma. When we recall the past oppression under British rule, we have infinite emotions.

Shonan, 20th (Central News Agency) - In view of the fact that various parts of Southeast Asia are now striving for food self-sufficiency, the Shonan Overseas Chinese Association previously recruited agricultural instructors trained by Engineer Goto of the Military Administration Department in order to cooperate with this policy and cultivate agricultural talents. At the moment, the instructors have completed their training and have been sent to work in various parts of Malaya, undertaking tasks such as guiding the reclamation of farmland, improving agricultural tools, and improving techniques. According to the past agriculture in Malaya, the traditional methods of cultivating the land have failed to achieve ideal harvests. It is expected that the cultivation methods in the future will be modernized due to the activities of these instructors, which will make a great contribution to increasing agricultural production.

### Three Indian Cabinet Members Resign, Demanding Gandhi's Release, Doctors Announce Gandhi's Declining Health, Restless Sleep, Weak Heartbeat

Stockholm, 20th, Huitong News Agency

According to the "London Times" New Delhi correspondent, after three members of the Indian Central Government cabinet resigned, the call for Gandhi's release has become even louder. The three cabinet members issued a brief statement explaining their reasons for resigning, stating that they did not agree with the government's attitude towards Gandhi's hunger strike and therefore resigned to apologize to the people. Indian newspapers welcomed the resignation of the three cabinet members, but Muslim newspapers strongly criticized it. The Indian government stated that the resignation of the three cabinet members was not due to disagreement with the government's policy but because they feared that if Gandhi died from the hunger strike, they would be held accountable.

Rangoon, 20th, Central News Agency - Two million overseas Indian residents in Burma are extremely concerned after receiving news that Gandhi's hunger strike, due to old age and physical weakness, is causing serious health problems. They have decided to continue to strive for the independence of their motherland, following in Gandhi's footsteps. The Burma Committee has decided to instruct branches in various places to convene public assemblies in Rangoon and other parts of Burma within a few days to express sympathy and determine strategies for striving for the independence of their motherland, and to pray that Gandhi will safely overcome the period of the hunger strike.

Istanbul, 20th, Central News Agency - Gandhi has been on hunger strike for nine days, and his physical strength is declining daily. According to a report from London, the Bombay State Government released a written statement on the 19th, signed by six of Gandhi's attending physicians, stating that since the night of the 18th, Gandhi had been drooling and unable to sleep. He was slightly better on the morning of the 19th and slept for a short while. His physical condition is extremely weak, and his heartbeat is very faint.

Bangkok, 20th, Huitong News Agency - A dispatch from the capital of India states that Gandhi's attending physicians yesterday forbade visitors from meeting with Gandhi, only allowing family members to enter and offer their regards.

Calls for Release Increase Daily

Bangkok, 20th, Huitong News Agency

The call for the unconditional release of Gandhi is increasing daily in various parts of India. The Bengal Legislative Council passed a resolution yesterday calling for the unconditional release of Gandhi. One hundred and fifty Indian political leaders held a meeting in New Delhi and also appointed a committee to draft a resolution calling for the unconditional release of Gandhi. The resolution is scheduled to be voted on today. The chairman of the meeting is former Madras Prime Minister Rajagopalachari, who has met with Sir Bertrand and President Roosevelt's representative, Philip.

Istanbul, 20th, Central News Agency

According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the Indian all-party conference initiated by Rajagopalachari was held in New Delhi on the 19th. More than one hundred representatives from various parties across India participated. A drafting committee was immediately formed to draft a petition to the Viceroy of India requesting the immediate release of Gandhi. The petition was originally intended to be submitted on the 20th, but because Gandhi's physical strength has deteriorated daily, there is no time to lose. The drafting committee submitted the draft petition to the Viceroy's Secretary on the same day.

Overseas Indians in Britain Concerned About Gandhi

Stockholm, 20th, Huitong News Agency - According to news from London, reports received last night are very pessimistic about Gandhi's health condition. Indians in London are praying for Gandhi and have sent a delegation to the House of Commons to distribute leaflets to members, demanding Gandhi's immediate release. It is said that several Labour Party members have already written to Gandhi, reporting that they have raised the demand for his release.

### Various Comments, Goebbels' Speech

Berlin, 20th, Huitong News Agency - German political reports state that Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels' ten questions to the German people are what Germany should deal with during this difficult period. The news that the Germans have received in the past few weeks is the most serious in many years. Everyone is concerned, and no one can stand idly by. Goebbels frankly admitted that Germany underestimated the Soviet Union. A Chinese proverb says, "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated." How true this is! Today, the Germans no longer have unrealistic fantasies about the Soviet Union. Whoever wants to defeat the Soviet Union in the Soviet climate has no other way than to be accustomed to the climate of that country. Germany's mistake was that while carrying out the annihilation of the Soviet Union, it also adhered to the life of Central Europe. Germany can now learn from this lesson and surely wash away the recent humiliation. There is no doubt.

Italy

Rome, 20th, Huitong News Agency - The Italian newspaper "Avvenire" commented on Goebbels' speech yesterday, saying that although the German army's withdrawal from Kharkov marks the entry of the Eastern Front war into an emergency state, Germany has mobilized its national strength to deal with the Soviet Union to the end. "Tribune" commented that the Soviet Union's alliance with Western democratic countries is actually to use them to carry out its world revolution, and democratic countries have no power to stop it. Therefore, the Allied countries are now in a dilemma.

### Practicing Wartime Living, Household Electricity Conservation

Under the major premise of conserving materials during wartime, efforts to minimize the consumption of unnecessary goods have been repeatedly emphasized by the authorities, and there is no need to elaborate. Electricity conservation is also one of the most essential material conservation practices that citizens should adopt. When not needed, of course, there is no need to turn on the lights. Even when necessary, one should concentrate on working with the minimum number of lights, reducing the number of lights used as much as possible.

If a 30-watt light bulb is used for five hours a day, saving one bulb can save 4.5 kilowatts per month. Although the amount is small, it accumulates to a considerable figure. Every citizen should pay attention to this and put it into practice. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, February 40th).

### American Social Unrest, Wage Issues Stalemate

(Zurich dispatch, 13th, sent by special correspondent) The US government is working hard to fix the cost of living during wartime, but the extra war expenses it has raised are now affecting various sectors of the US economy, and a major threat is felt. Coordination between the US government and labor unions is becoming increasingly difficult. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington, the leaders of the two major labor unions, American Federation of Labor President Green and Congress of Industrial Organizations President Murray, protested to Roosevelt against the ever-increasing cost of living, indicating a surge in public dissatisfaction. In fact, various labor groups in the United States have recently frequently issued demands for wage increases. The War Labor Board's regulations for increasing wages in the iron industry exceed the 15% wage standard of 1941, but Economic Adjustment Bureau Director Barnes questioned the War Labor Board whether this regulation should be revised.

Although the wages of American mine workers have been determined by the Labor Board as the highest, the mine workers' union still demands that the wages of 450,000 coal miners be increased by two yuan per day. The pit workers' union argues that the principle is not appropriate, so the principle of wage increase must be increased by at least 15%. Sixty-four thousand workers in Chicago's four largest canneries, where wages have already reached the highest amount, also demand an additional 5% increase in hourly wages. If the War Labor Board approves this wage increase, it would be tantamount to abandoning the aforementioned 15% policy. If the wages of cannery workers increase, food prices cannot but rise accordingly, which is dangerous for the overall price policy and cost-of-living policy. Green said that the 15% policy is too rigid and is not appropriate due to the continuous increase in prices. Therefore, Green believes that if the cost of living cannot be fixed, then wages cannot be fixed either. Labor Secretary Perkins pointed out that the price of agricultural products is the reason for the high cost of living.

Therefore, in the United States, wage disputes and the crisis of inflation are both unavoidable facts and are becoming seeds of bitterness. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, February 15th)

### Japanese Cultural Work in China: A Glimpse of Medical, Educational, and Facilities

(Tokyo telephone) During the budget general meeting of your esteemed hospital on the 18th, Okabe Nagakage questioned: "What decisions have been made regarding cultural work to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere? I would like to hear the details regarding cultural policies, etc." Prime Minister Tojo replied: "We are now implementing various measures in the political, economic, and cultural sectors, and we are revealing a clear policy for future perfection." Regarding cultural work in China, Greater East Asia Minister Aoki said: "We are now implementing measures such as medical care and popularizing the Japanese language in China." A glimpse of the Japanese government's path for cultural work in China can be seen here. Its specific measures and plans are roughly as follows:

The total budget related to cultural work, including the previously decided budget of 18 million yuan, totals far more than 28 million yuan, of which about 9 million yuan is for medical and epidemic prevention. From this, we can see the government's attention to medical care. The main epidemic prevention measures have already established epidemic prevention committees in the 12 regions of Central China and are continuing to promote them. Last autumn, there was a tiger epidemic in Guangzhou, but the committee made every effort to curb it. In addition to the four major epidemic prevention centers in Hangzhou, Suzhou, Nanjing, and Wuhu, a new Central China Epidemic Prevention Center is being newly established in Shanghai, making its content and appearance the best in the world. This is currently being planned. These epidemic prevention facilities will be gradually realized under the entire organization of the large-scale Charitable Society. The Charitable Society also established clinics in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Lushan, Jiujiang, Hankou, Wuhu, Wuxi, Suzhou, Jinhua, and other places, established hospitals, and actively served the common people.

The popularization of the Japanese language has now surpassed the stage of guidance and persuasion. Under the new face of Sino-Japanese co-existence and co-death, the entire China is now filled with a new scene of enthusiastic learning. In the future, the policy of establishing Japanese language schools in Central China will be: (1) establishing exemplary Japanese language schools; (2) evenly establishing Japanese language schools in various regions. We eagerly await its early realization.

The government is also establishing a specialized department in the East Asia Common Culture Academy starting in April and opening a North China Higher Industrial School in Beijing, in order to substantially improve educational institutions and advance simultaneously with the popularization of the Japanese language. In addition, the new Shanghai Medical University established by the Charitable Society is also gradually becoming concrete. Last autumn, the Lester Industrial School was renamed the East Asia Higher School and operated by the East Asia Common Culture Academy, which will surely contribute greatly to industrial education. (Xiang: Translated from the Evening Edition of the Continental New Daily, February 19th)

### New Oil Rationing Plan to be Officially Implemented

City Divided into Seven Jurisdictional Areas, Monthly Issuance of Oil Purchase Certificates

Since the Shanghai food oil industry wholesale office implemented oil rationing in the city, there have often been delays in deliveries and limited quantities, resulting in insufficient supply. Each distribution date has caused citizens to crowd and compete for purchases. Although the food oil wholesale office has worked to improve the distribution system to alleviate residents' suffering from oil shortages, it has still been difficult to achieve the expected satisfactory results. Recently, in order to completely reform, the food oil wholesale office has decided to follow the household rice rationing method and distribute oil based on the number of people per household.

Shanghai Divided into Seven Jurisdictional Areas

The distribution method divides all of Shanghai into (1) the Public Concession, (2) the French Concession, (3) Western Shanghai, (4) the Hongkou Naval Garrison Area, (5) Nanshi, (6) Northern Shanghai, and (7) Pudong, for a total of seven jurisdictional areas. The oil distribution procedures for the two concessions will be handled by the concession authorities, issuing oil purchase certificates once a month, following the rice purchase certificate method. Oil distribution in Western Shanghai, Nanshi, Northern Shanghai, and Pudong will still be handled by the food oil wholesale office.

Retail Oil Stores Designated in Each Area

The amount of oil distributed will depend entirely on the quantity of deliveries and stock on hand. Retail oil stores within the seven jurisdictional areas have also been designated, totaling 364 stores. The distribution of stores in each area is as follows: 65 in the French Concession, 104 in the Public Concession, 66 in Hongkou, 45 in Nanshi, 43 in Western Shanghai, 18 in Northern Shanghai, and 23 in Pudong.

Restaurants and Taverns Follow Previous Method

The quantity and date of each sale will be determined as needed, depending on the delivery situation. Organizations that cannot obtain household oil rations can apply separately. Restaurants and taverns will also continue to follow the previous method. It is expected that oil rationing will be promoted more smoothly in the future.

Estimated Population and Oil Quantity Figures

Excluding the three districts of Northern Shanghai, Nanshi, and Pudong, the approximate population and the estimated retail oil quantity are recorded below after re-examination:

### February Sugar Rationing Ready, Purchase Certificates Issued Within the Next Two Days

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has completed the distribution of February sugar to various retailers and has set aside the 20th and 21st of this month for the issuance of purchase certificates. It is reported that although today is a regular Sunday holiday, the office will still be open as usual to allow retailers to bring their application receipts to the office to exchange for them within the deadline and pay for them at the designated distribution sugar companies by the 23rd. Those who fail to exchange for purchase certificates within the deadline or who have already received purchase certificates but do not pay at the designated sugar companies within the deadline will be deemed to have automatically forfeited their rights and will not be allocated sugar. It is reported that the office has notified all retailers to follow these instructions and avoid any errors.

### Income Tax Bureau Holds Meeting, Five New Measures Submitted to the Ministry of Finance for Approval

Allied Press, Shanghai: The Ministry of Finance's Income Tax Bureau is currently holding continuous meetings in Shanghai to study ways to expand income tax revenue. The new measures will be implemented after approval by the Ministry of Finance and include: (1) levying income tax on foreign firms; (2) forcing merchants to record transactions; (3) increasing income tax rates; (4) strictly preventing merchants from falsifying accounts and evading taxes; and (5) revising the basic system for collecting income tax. Officials hope that after the implementation of these new measures, this year's income tax revenue will increase at least twice compared to last year.

### Rickshaw Companies Must Obtain Licenses to Operate, Issuance Starts March 1st, Approximately 20 Yuan per Quarter

The Municipal Council stipulates that all public rickshaw companies must obtain licenses to operate starting from March 1st of this year. The prescribed license fee is 20 yuan per quarter for premises of 500 square feet or less, and an additional 4 yuan per quarter for each additional 100 square feet or less. Each rickshaw company must apply for a license from the Council's Vehicle Affairs Office starting from the prescribed date; otherwise, they will not be allowed to operate within the boundaries.

### Gaussot Flew to Nanjing Yesterday

French Ambassador Gaussot left Shanghai for Nanjing at 9:00 a.m. yesterday and arrived at 10:40 a.m. to inspect the new situation after China's entry into the war. It is reported that the French Ambassador has been in Shanghai for several weeks after coming from North China.

### French Concession Implements Universal Vaccination

The French Concession Health Office pays great attention to public health for residents within the concession and implements universal smallpox vaccination. It is cooperating with the Baojia authorities to conduct door-to-door vaccination, dispatching doctors to Baojia offices in various districts to administer vaccinations. The Baojia chiefs will notify residents in their Baojia to bring all family members to the designated locations for vaccination on the scheduled dates, free of charge, but they must not evade, or they will be punished.

### Mr. Okuda, Section Chief, Returns to Shanghai from Japan, Discussing Economic Policies Towards China: Everything Must Align with Realistic Circumstances, and Detailed Handling of Matters is Entrusted to Local Authorities

Our Shanghai correspondent from Domei News Agency reports: Mr. Okuda, the Economic Section Chief of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, has returned to Shanghai on Thursday after traveling to Tokyo to discuss future Japanese economic policies towards China with central authorities. The following day, he told reporters from Domei News Agency that since the National Government has joined the Greater East Asia War, Japan's policy towards China is to focus on enhancing China's combat capabilities and revitalizing its national economy. The Tokyo authorities, in implementing new policies towards China, are well aware that they should align with realistic circumstances, and the detailed handling of various matters should be decided by local authorities.

Merchants Should Participate in the Purchase and Sale of Goods

Regarding the reorganization of trade, procurement, and distribution agencies, no concrete plans have been finalized. However, signs indicate that future trade in Central China will be dominated by the Japanese, while trade between Central China, North China, and South China will be entrusted to Chinese merchants. Chinese merchants should participate in the purchase and sale of goods in China, so the current purchase and sale agencies must be reorganized to adapt to the new situation. Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Mr. Kishi stated in the Diet that Japan will procure goods in China at reasonable prices. The so-called reasonable price is neither too low nor too high, but a reasonable price that considers factors such as cost.

Maintaining Shanghai's Production, Promoting Heavy Industry

Speaking of increasing industrial production in Shanghai, he hopes to achieve this by increasing the purchase of raw materials. Although heavy industry is currently concentrated in Japan, efforts will also be made to promote heavy industry in China. Mr. Okuda denied that the textile industry would be transferred from Japan to China, saying that considering the current shortage of raw materials in Shanghai's yarn factories, which has reduced production by 70%, this is highly unlikely.

### Winter Relief Office to Open a Gruel Kitchen in Zhabei, Subject to Municipal Government Approval for a Scheduled Opening

The municipal government-sponsored winter relief efforts for the 31st year have been launched in stages according to the established relief projects. The winter relief office, recognizing that there are more poor households in Zhabei than in Nanshi and Western Shanghai, has consulted with Mr. Li Xiamin, a representative of the Zhabei Charity Group, several times. As a result, it was decided to add a winter relief gruel kitchen in the Zhabei Charity Group on Nanxing Road, north of the New Zha Bridge, to expand relief efforts. The necessary start-up costs and staff salaries will be the responsibility of the Charity Group, while the winter relief office will be responsible for supplying rice and fuel, effectively making it a collaborative effort. The number of gruel recipients is tentatively set at 2,000. It is reported that once approved by the municipal government, the kitchen will open on a scheduled basis, which is indeed good news for the poor in Zhabei.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade Report for January

Last month, the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade received a total of 65 fire alarms, including six false alarms made in good faith and three special alarms. The estimated value of property lost in fires within the Public Concession and special property tax areas was $8,254,050. One citizen died in a fire, four were injured, four were injured in special incidents, and five firefighters were injured while fighting fires. In addition, the fire brigade's ambulance was dispatched 171 times, transporting a total of 202 patients to various hospitals.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Regular Budget for This Year (Continued from the 17th)

(1) When retailers apply to increase prices, the council will review their applications. If the prices requested by the merchants are deemed fair by the council, they will be approved. These prices will become the maximum retail prices and must not be exceeded.

(2) In certain circumstances, the council will set maximum retail prices on its own. The council issues the above two notices based on the provisions of Article 53 of the newly attached rules to the Land Regulations. This article authorizes the council to publish a list of items subject to price controls at any time. However, until the end of the year, at the request of the Japanese authorities, the council limited price controls to retail items only. Wholesale prices have not been controlled, except in a few cases where prices for cotton cloth, wool fabric, canned goods, leather goods, etc., were set in cooperation with manufacturers, wholesalers, and other related parties.

The work of calculating costs is extremely complex. In addition to setting prices for bread, flatbread, and other wheat products, the prices of approximately 6,000 kinds of daily necessities sold to the general public in large department stores have been successively evaluated. In addition, the prices of more than 1,000 kinds of daily necessities sold in other types of stores have also been set. There are also many types of price limits set for meat, fresh milk, and piece goods of wool fabric. By the end of the year, the total number of items with price limits approved by this section reached 10,786.

The council has two sections to implement price control work. One is the Cost Calculation Section, as mentioned above. The other is the Investigation and Enforcement of Price Limits Section. It is found that on November 18 and 24, and December 4, 1941, the council issued three notices stipulating the retail price limits for imported goods. At that time, in order to implement these price limits, an Enforcement of Price Limits Office was established in the Industrial and Social Affairs Department, supervised by the Enforcement of Price Limits Committee. Later, as the council's price control work increased, the scope of the Enforcement of Price Limits Office was expanded. In April of the previous year, the office was transferred to the Price Control Office and renamed the Investigation and Enforcement of Price Limits Section. By the end of the year, almost all retail prices were under control, and the work of the Enforcement of Price Limits Section suddenly became heavy. The section was divided into two parts, one for the Investigation Office and one for the Enforcement of Price Limits Office, so that each could be responsible for its own duties.

The work of the Investigation Office, as its name suggests, is to investigate whether stores have violated the price limit regulations. The staff includes one chief investigator, six inspectors, and seventy-one investigators. These personnel are currently continuing to conduct systematic investigations of stores within the concession. Any violation discovered will be reported to the Enforcement of Price Limits Office for review. The office employs five experienced lawyers to interview those who have violated the regulations. Anyone deemed to have violated the regulations will be notified by the office to come to the bureau to be interviewed by the lawyers and given the opportunity to present reasons why they should not be punished. If a violation is established, it will be transferred to the Enforcement of Price Limits Committee for review and determination of penalties.

Throughout the past year, the Investigation and Enforcement of Price Limits Section conducted a total of 55,115 investigations and received 396 letters from citizens reporting the inability to purchase price-controlled goods and other violations to the council for investigation. At the same time, the Enforcement of Price Limits Office summoned violators for interviews 7,738 times, of which 3,046 were punished.

Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth: There are many yarn factories in Shanghai, and cotton cloth is very important for the clothing of ordinary people in China. Therefore, the rise and fall of yarn and cloth prices, like other bulk commodities such as rice, etc., is enough to affect the general price level in Shanghai. Speculative trading of yarn and cloth was quite active last year. In early November, the council announced a ban on the trading of Shuangma brand cotton yarn, which was the first step in cracking down on yarn and cloth speculation. At the end of the same month, the price limits for various brands of yarn and cloth were announced. At the same time, a registration of yarn and cloth inventory was conducted, and it was stipulated that all new goods should be registered with the council at any time. Since the registration of yarn and cloth is important, the council has specially added an office to handle it.

### A Few Hopes for Suppressing Prices

— Yuqi

Since the Lunar New Year, prices have been rising sharply, causing great concern for the salaried class. This situation cannot be allowed to continue. Therefore, I would like to express a few hopes to the authorities.

(1) Implement a "Market Cleaning Movement": The excuse for soaring prices is that the source of supply is cut off, and inventories are dwindling. Therefore, demand exceeds supply, and prices have to rise. However, according to various newspapers, since the opening of the customs, the supply of various goods has become normal, and inventories are also abundant. There is no shortage in the short term. Obviously, the soaring prices are all due to speculation, the so-called black market trading. If there is black market trading, there must be real goods. Otherwise, how can there be so many merchants doing that kind of empty trading? However, on the surface, they all pretend to be acting, falsely claiming that hundreds of goods are in short supply, prompting prices to rise, which is even more obvious. It is not really that the source of supply is not smooth, but actually due to the hoarding of unscrupulous merchants and the speculation of merchants.

Therefore, I hope that the authorities can immediately implement a "Market Cleaning Movement." Force open warehouses, strictly search storage areas, and strictly inspect stores, even residences should be inspected. Then, the general hoarders will have nowhere to hide. Once unregistered private goods are found, they should be confiscated and sold at flat prices, because "the wool comes from the sheep." If a fine is imposed, then general unscrupulous merchants will try every means to raise prices afterwards, which is indirectly equivalent to punishing ordinary people. In recent times, those who hoard goods and speculate to raise prices and make profits have regarded fines as insignificant, and this is also the reason why.

(2) Make Every Effort to Unblock Sources: On the one hand, implement a "Market Cleaning Movement," which is the so-called symptomatic treatment, so that hoarded goods are released. On the other hand, if more effort is put into unblocking sources, which is the fundamental cure, it can be even more effective. Because once the saturation point of supply exceeding demand is reached, and then the balance of supply and demand is achieved, then unscrupulous merchants can no longer use the excuse of "short supply," and the act of raising prices cannot be sustained. Then the decline in prices can also be like quicksilver, proportional to the rise in prices.

(3) Strictly Enforce Price Limits: It is heard that the economic police of the concession authorities have completed their training. It is hoped that after that, the enforcement of the newly announced price limits can be absolutely strict. Once fraud and other circumstances are discovered, strict investigations will be conducted without leniency, so as to warn others against following suit. Perhaps people's livelihood can gradually become stable.

(4) Compulsorily Implement Flat Sales: For all the goods that have been registered with the concession authorities, the authorities should select 90% of the most common and practical ones and implement compulsory flat sales: just like the old days when the big flat sales were implemented, to solve the immediate crisis. Then, gradually improve it.

Among the above four points, the first point is particularly important. This move can not only investigate the population, but also stabilize people's livelihood, which is truly killing two birds with one stone.

### Residence Certificates in the French Concession Must Be Hung in Obvious Places for Random Inspections

The police authorities of the French Concession have completed the household registration survey of residents in the concession, and residence certificates have also been completely issued. Now, in order to prevent petty criminals from hiding in the concession and to effectively maintain local security, police officers are dispatched to various districts from time to time to conduct random household registration inspections according to the Baojia system. Therefore, it is specifically ordered that each head of household must hang the residence certificate in an obvious place for random inspections at any time. Otherwise, they will be punished according to the regulations.

### China and Japan Will Cooperate to Establish an Economic Investigation Agency, Which May Be Established Next Month

There is still no national economic investigation agency, so we know nothing about the economic situation, such as the prosperity and decline of industry and commerce in various places, and the production and reserves of various minerals. According to news from this city, recently the Japanese side has consulted with our country's authorities and plans to establish a complete economic investigation agency in cooperation with China and Japan. The construction departments of various provinces, cities, and counties will jointly cooperate to carry out various economic investigations. It is heard that this agency may be announced next month.

### St. John's University Fires British and American Faculty

St. John's University in Shanghai, located on Fanhuangdu Road, was founded by the American Church and has been in operation for more than 70 years. Most of the faculty and staff hired on weekdays are of British or American nationality. After the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9 of this year, various institutions have dismissed British and American employees. Since the semester is about to end, the school allowed them to continue in their positions. Starting from the beginning of this semester on the 18th of this month, British and American faculty and staff have been dismissed. However, British and American students are temporarily admitted. According to Bishop Yu of the school, this move aims to support the National Government's will to participate in the war and strive to promote the victory of the war.

### Shen Bao Monthly, Issue No. 2, Published

Since the republication of Shen Bao Monthly, subscriptions have been very enthusiastic. The republished issue sold out soon after publication. The second issue has now been published, and the content is very rich. There are eight articles discussing current affairs issues, namely "The Opposition Between Britain and the United States and Its Essentials," "The Question of the Recovery of the Concessions," "The Belligerent Countries Preparing for Decisive Battle," "The General Situation of Burma's Nationalities and Their Movements," "Hawaii, the Heart of the Pacific," "The Indian Princes," etc. The special feature of this issue discusses China's economic issues after participating in the war, with a total of six articles, all of which are excellent works and discuss the issue in detail. In addition, the wartime geographical knowledge introduces the situation of the islands surrounding Australia. An article on Japanese literature in China introduces the situation of Japanese literature in China after the war. There are also four articles on Yinhai Guangwen, three articles on Gu Yi Congtan, and one translated novel. There are also ten current affairs drawings. The topics are too numerous to mention, and the interest is very strong. Although the number of copies in this issue is more than double that of the republished issue, due to the crowding of buyers, it is feared that it will still be too late to purchase. I hope that all sectors will subscribe as early as possible.

### Shanghai, Suzhou, and Other "Cleaned-Up Areas" to Form Flour Rationing Cooperatives, Flour Production of Various Factories to Be Rationed Directly at Fixed Prices

Regarding the issue of flour rationing in Central China, the relevant Chinese and Japanese authorities have been studying countermeasures since last winter and preparing to organize a flour rationing cooperative. According to the Commercial News Agency's investigation, the cooperative is nearing completion after preparation by both China and Japan. On the 15th of this month, Chinese and Japanese representatives from flour mills and flour operators in Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other nearby areas were convened in Wu to hold a meeting. As a result, it was unanimously decided to formally establish the "Flour Rationing Cooperative for Cleaned-Up Areas" in the shortest possible time. After the establishment of the cooperative, the flour produced by various flour mills will be directly rationed by the cooperative at official prices to supply the people's food. At the same time, the black market for flour will also be resolutely suppressed.

Our correspondent from Domei News Agency reports that all small-scale flour mills in Central China will soon be under the unified management of the Central China Flour Mill Federation in order to accelerate the production of flour and bran and implement satisfactory distribution. The federation has sent personnel to Wuxi and other places in the interior to investigate the actual situation of flour and bran production.

Our correspondent from Domei News Agency reports that the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, in order to further promote the circulation of Central Reserve Vouchers, has recently launched a movement to make retail in Shanghai generally denominated in Central Reserve Vouchers, with particular emphasis on Hongkou, where the Japanese community is concentrated. The Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai is backing this movement and urging Japanese restaurants and hotels to use Central Reserve Vouchers for price markings and charges to replace military scrip. It is also heard that half of the salaries of all employees of Japanese commercial firms will be paid in Central Reserve Vouchers. Currently, 30% of the salaries of employees of various Japanese national policy companies are paid in Central Reserve Vouchers.

### Stepping Up Price Controls, Reorganizing the Structures of Various Trade Associations, More Than 300 Units Approved for Establishment to Assist the Authorities in Implementing Economic Policies

In the past, the Shanghai trade associations had many obstacles to commercial development due to the changing environment and the lack of leadership. After the reorganization by the social movement authorities, the structures gradually expanded. After the municipal chamber of commerce was restored, the Shanghai Municipal Council successively established a trade association section, and the situation greatly changed. The organizational structure of the associations was also expanded, and at the same time, members of the trade were widely solicited to join the associations. According to an investigation by the Shanghai Social News Agency, as of recently, there are more than 300 units of trade associations that have been formally approved by the social movement authorities and registered with the Shanghai Municipal Council trade association section. Therefore, the registered associations tend to be unified in structure.

Forty Units Have Been Dissolved

It is found that there were originally 368 units of trade associations in Shanghai, of which only 149 were registered with the authorities. Currently, about 40 units of trade associations have been dissolved, namely the gasoline industry, automobile industry, truck industry, shipping industry, navigation industry, coal transportation industry, wireless advertising industry, oil lamp industry, military uniform industry, pawnshop redemption industry, and servant introduction industry. Therefore, there are only more than 320 associations remaining. Now, due to the control of the authorities, almost all of them have registered with the competent authorities and been approved for establishment, so as to assist the authorities in implementing economic policies.

Assisting in Price Limits and Distribution of Goods

As for the trade association section established by the Shanghai Municipal Council, its scope of work has been expanding since its establishment. The original motivation for the establishment of the section was to contact various trade associations in the city to cooperate in controlling prices and distributing goods. In addition to trying to communicate the relationship between the authorities and various industries, if difficulties occur in various industries, it will accept the good faith applications of the trade associations, review them, and further guide the activities of the industries, so that officials and businessmen can seek solutions. In terms of price control, the section will seek a reasonable price level under the principle of considering both commerce and people's livelihood. In terms of steps, it will first adjust the manufacturing cost of goods, and then gradually control the separate retail prices through wholesale.

### The Prohibition of Spitting Anywhere to Be Enforced Long-Term, The Second Week of Promotion Concluded Successfully Yesterday

The second week of the anti-spitting campaign launched by the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department, which began on the 14th of this month, concluded successfully yesterday (20th). Information about the campaign was obtained from the Health Department authorities as follows:

The Police Are Doing Their Best to Assist in the Execution of Fines

The second week of the anti-spitting campaign in the Public Concession has been underway for a week. During this period, with the help of the tenth police station, the publicity work has been able to proceed smoothly, and the original order to fine violators 5 yuan has been effectively enforced. Therefore, the Health Department is very grateful for the assistance of the police. The general public, through the authorities' sincere advice and extensive publicity, has been able to deeply understand the trial of spitting anywhere, and has been able to be vigilant and reform their stubborn habits.

Fines Will Be Used for Public Health Work

However, residents who are fined on Thursdays do not care about this. It is said that these fines will be fully used for public health work. The prohibition of spitting anywhere will be enforced long-term. The regulation of fining 5 yuan each time will continue to be effective. Therefore, the authorities sincerely hope that residents will pay attention to avoid unnecessary losses. At the same time, it is heard that the Health Department plans to expand the scope of public health publicity in the future, so that every resident of Shanghai can take care of the health of the public and make Shanghai a world-famous clean area.

### Shanghai Qingxiang Branch Promotes Second Phase of Qingxiang Campaign: Second Committee Meeting Held Yesterday, with Director Chen Personally Present to Preside

The Shanghai Branch of the Qingxiang Committee, considering that the first phase of the first Qingxiang campaign is nearing completion and the second phase of the first Qingxiang campaign is about to begin, held its second committee meeting at 2:30 PM yesterday (the 20th) in the conference room of the branch to review the implementation of past work and make improvements for the future. More than 20 people attended, including Director Chen, Office Director Xu, various committee members, heads of offices and departments, and district commissioners.

First Qingxiang Campaign Nears Completion

Chairman Chen delivered an on-the-spot report, stating that the first phase of the first Qingxiang campaign in the city is nearing completion, and the second phase of the first campaign is also about to begin. To review the past and improve the future, he hoped that everyone would express their opinions as much as possible for reference. In his observation, while there were many advantages in the past Qingxiang campaigns, shortcomings could not be ignored. The advantages should be promoted, and the shortcomings should be corrected. As for the organizational structure, although it has been able to achieve unification, the laws and regulations are not yet complete and specific. There should be close contact between the Qingxiang Branch and the municipal government to achieve twice the result with half the effort. The advancement of military affairs and politics should also be in sync. Other tasks, such as material management, Baojia organization, and enforcement of blockades, require concerted efforts to achieve significant results. He hoped that all responsible personnel would earnestly promote the campaigns.

Field Tax Donations Discussed

Office Director Xu reported on the promotion of self-defense, self-government, education, transportation construction, and the preparations for the second phase of the Qingxiang campaign. Then, discussions began on how to manage the rice for the Qingxiang teams, how to handle factories in the Qingxiang areas, how to handle relief efforts in the Qingxiang areas, compensation for those who died on duty, plans to establish reformatories and vocational training centers for vagrants, selecting outstanding renovators, how to levy field taxes in the 32nd year, and how to adjust donations in the Qingxiang areas to reduce the burden on the people. More than ten proposals were thoroughly discussed and successfully passed. The meeting was adjourned at 5:00 PM.

Qingxiang Dynamics Broadcast Tonight

The Propaganda Office of the Shanghai Qingxiang Branch will hold a broadcast lecture on "Recent Developments in Shanghai's Qingxiang Campaign" from 9:30 PM to 10:00 PM tonight (the 21st) through the Shanghai Broadcasting Station. It will provide a summary report on major events in the Shanghai Qingxiang campaign and point out its significance, so that all sectors can understand the current situation of the Shanghai Qingxiang campaign.

Investigation of Private Schools

In order to understand the nature and general situation of the supplementary education institutions in the Qingxiang areas, the Shanghai Qingxiang Branch has formulated a survey form and instructed all special district offices to fill it out and report in detail. According to the report from the Fengxian Special District Office, there are eleven private schools in the district's eight townships, including Dunhe Township, with a total of 216 male and female students. There are no other formal supplementary schools.

### Punishment for Short Weights Used by Beef Vendors

Qie Chongbo (transliteration), a beef vendor at stall number 35 of the Seymour Road market, was found to be using inaccurate scales, shorting approximately half a pound for every ten pounds. After being discovered by the Health Department of the Public Works Department, he was prosecuted in the Special District Court and fined 200 yuan on the 19th of this month, and the scales were confiscated.

### Housing Disputes Decrease in Western Shanghai

According to a reporter's statement from those managing housing subletting affairs in western Shanghai, there have been many housing disputes in the western district of Shanghai. Recently, the authorities have actively adjusted the organization of the management office, revised the regulations, accepted residents' complaints about various disputes, and mediated them. As a result, housing disputes have gradually decreased, and landlords and tenants have generally been able to live in peace.

### Closing of the Chief of the Embassy Office Conference: Five Representatives Express Their Thoughts

The first conference of chiefs of the judicial affairs departments under the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, held in Shanghai on the 18th and 19th since the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, has successfully concluded. After this meeting, the police administration policy for Central and Southern China has been established to adapt to the new situation after the National Government's entry into the war, with the aim of achieving the ideal. The police chiefs of the consulates in Shanghai, Suzhou, Nanjing, Hankou, and Guangdong expressed their thoughts after the meeting on the 19th as follows:

### Shanghai Chief Shirakami

Due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War last year, work in various areas was busy, so the annual meeting of chiefs in Central and Southern China could not be held. This time, the meeting was held at a critical time, so many important proposals were put forward. Moreover, it was the first meeting after the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry. All attendees discussed fervently. Regarding the content of the meeting, it cannot be disclosed in detail. All policies have been instructed by the superiors and will be implemented successively by the police departments.

### Nanjing Chief Shibosawa

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the National Government's entry into the war, everything has changed. We have the responsibility to protect and inspect Japanese residents. In our work, we feel that there are many difficult problems to handle. After this meeting, we have received detailed instructions from the province, which we can follow. We will use this as a basis and consider it carefully. In the future, no matter what problems arise, we believe that we will be able to solve them for the Japanese residents.

### Hankou Chief Kawashima

After this meeting, we fully understand the new situation after the National Government's entry into the war. The Greater East Asia Ministry police officers serving in China are determined to fulfill their important mission. The police mission is not only limited to maintaining law and order as in the past. We must have the determination to abandon selfishness and serve the public in all aspects. The security in Hankou has been excellent recently. In terms of economic control, all purchasing and distribution agencies have been fully established, based on Sino-Japanese cooperation as a prerequisite. It is expected that the administration will be smooth.

### Guangdong Chief Suzuki

Since the occupation of Hong Kong, Guangdong has taken on a new look. Especially after the National Government's entry into the war, Guangdong has become an important town in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Our responsibility is even greater. During the meeting, I reported on the uniqueness of Guangdong. The relationship between Guangdong and Hong Kong is very deep. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Guangdong has had a significant impact on the Battle of Hong Kong. Therefore, we are very concerned about the uniqueness of Guangdong. I believe that at this great time, we must have a firm determination.

### Suzhou Chief Kitagawa

This meeting provided clear guidance on police policy and was very rewarding. The meeting has ended, and I will return to my post immediately. In the future, I will devote myself to supervising my subordinates to strengthen the police mission. For the Japanese residents in my jurisdiction, I will thoroughly implement the police spirit and work hard in my position. This time, I was able to meet with old colleagues and officials and understand the actual situation in various places, which can be used as a reference.

### Wang Jinxiu Zhai Murder Case: Jin Fugen Sentenced to Death: Appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court After Disagreeing with the Initial Trial: Still Sentenced to Death, Plans to File a Third Trial Appeal

On the night of June 26th of last year, the Wang Jinxiu Zhai jewelry store at 521 Xiafei Road was broken into by former partner Tang Wenxiang, who colluded with Jin Fugen, the owner of the Changxing Flower Shop at 519 next door, and apprentice Wang Ruigen. They climbed over the wall into the kiosk, intending to kill the store owner, Wang Weiyuan. Fortunately, Wang had left Shanghai for Suzhou that day, and escaped the disaster. They killed Wang's five-year-old adopted son, Wang Mian, and injured Wang's cousin, Qu Huide. Then, they pried open the drawer and stole 300 yuan in new currency. After the incident, the court Lao arrested the three criminals, Tang, Jin, and Wang, and the suspect, Wang Weiyuan's stepmother, Wang Yangshi, and her lover, Gao Sheting, one after another. After investigation, because Wang Yangshi and Gao Shouting had little to do with the case, they were released first. The three criminals, Tang Wenxiang, Jin Fugen, and Wang Ruigen, were sent to the Special District Court No. 2 to be prosecuted for robbery and murder. Tang Wenxiang died in custody due to illness. The first trial sentenced Jin Fugen to death for robbery and murder, and deprived him of his civil rights for life. Wang Ruigen was sentenced to three years in prison for robbery. Tang Wenxiang's case was not accepted. The heir of Wang Wenxiang accepted the judgment. Jin Fugen, disagreeing with the judgment, appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. After repeated court hearings and witness testimonies, the judgment was issued yesterday. The original judgment was revoked. Jin Fugen was sentenced to one year in prison for robbery, and sentenced to death for joint murder, and deprived of civil rights for life, to be carried out together with the death penalty and deprivation of civil rights for life. It is reported that the criminal Jin is still not convinced by the appeal judgment and is preparing to file a third trial appeal with the Supreme Court.

### Annual Report of the Housing Rent Conciliation Committee: 134 Issues Handled, Striving to Achieve Agreement Between Both Parties in Each Dispute

The Public Works Department established the Housing Rent Conciliation Committee in December of the year before last to address the housing shortage and the rent issues arising from the depreciation of currency value. In conjunction with the Bureau of Legal Affairs, it has been resolving disputes between landlords and tenants. By the end of last year, the committee had handled 134 issues, including:

66 cases filed by tenants, 68 cases filed by landlords. The committee held 114 meetings and mediated with a cautious attitude. The conciliation status accepted by the committee last year was: 44 cases were resolved through concessions from both sides, 17 cases were decided by the committee, 30 cases were returned because they were not within the jurisdiction, 24 cases were rejected, 16 cases were filed in court, and 3 cases are currently under review, totaling 134 cases.

The Public Works Department's Housing Rent Conciliation Committee made the following statement regarding the rules for mediating rent lending:

(1) The movement to increase or decrease rent began in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. By the 26th year, rents gradually increased. The current rent valuation is still based on the 26th year. According to a survey, due to unfair tax burdens, a special committee decided to increase it by 20%.

(1) At that time, some people thought that this measure was not very fair in terms of valuation, and even before the incident, in the 26th year, rents were already unfair due to various reasons. Therefore, the Public Works Department conducted a new valuation of land and buildings on a certain basis. This measure does not apply to the purpose of taxation. In the actual situation in August of the 31st year, it can also be seen from the perspective of the relative rental price of housing.

(1) This valuation should not be higher than the original valuation, and can be called fair. When the conciliation committee decides on the amount of rent that forms the basis for adjusting rent, it has considered comparing the same type of housing in the same area. Each dispute is mediated according to its actual situation, and it is resolved only after both parties agree.

### Special Issue on Various Places in Nanyang, Part Three: The Philippines, Past and Present (3)

— Voters

The shortage of transportation vessels and the sluggish trade between the United States and the Philippines have profoundly affected peaceful industries, especially the sugar industry, which accounts for the bulk of the Philippines' exports. In 1941, the quantitative export of sugar to the United States was 950,000 tons, of which 100,000 tons were stockpiled due to insufficient shipping space, causing a severe blow to the Philippine sugar industry. However, in reality, it was not just the sugar industry. For example, the iron ore and timber industries, which have always been trade-centered on exports to Japan, were shut down to cut off exports to Japan, and the timber industry was shut down, adding a large unemployed population. In November 1941, the number of unemployed in the Philippines reached 400,000. (According to the World Panic — in 1932, the total number of unemployed in the Philippines was 479,063, including 265,609 agricultural operators and 213,454 industrial workers.)

Any change in trade with the United States will immediately affect the Philippine economy. Clarifying the trade between the United States and the Philippines in recent years can make this clear. This fully points out the Philippines' dependence on the United States. A change in this relationship is tantamount to a fatal blow to the Philippines:

Philippines-US Trade (Unit: Thousands of Pesos)

From this reality of US-Philippine trade, it can be seen how dangerous the consequences of a one-day severance will be. In particular, the main products of the Philippines, such as sugar, coconut, coconut oil, tobacco, and hemp, are mostly for export to the United States, and cannot be expected to be digested in the domestic market. After trade is difficult to sever, the phenomena of overproduction and stagnant goods will cause economic panic. On the other hand, the severance of consumer goods and other inputs, followed by a shortage of some commodities, will inevitably lead to a phenomenon of skyrocketing prices. The main materials imported by the United States into the Philippines are meat and dairy products, cigarettes, cotton products, automobiles, gasoline, steel products, mining machinery, and electrical appliances, etc. In addition, food is even more important. The Philippines produces about 14 million stones of rice, and corn also has a considerable output. However, it is not enough to supply the needs of 16 million people, and a large amount of rice and wheat must be imported from the United States and Vietnam every year. In addition, fruits and vegetables are imported to the tune of 7 million pesos annually, processed fish products 4 million pesos, wheat flour 10 million pesos, processed meat products 3 million pesos, coffee and cocoa 3.5 million pesos, for a total of 27.5 million pesos in food imports. Some of these foods were originally imported from Europe, Japan, and Australia, but they have been interrupted by the European War, the blockade of Japan, and the lack of ships, and have to rely entirely on the United States for supply. The severance of materials such as automobiles will only strike the 20,000 to 30,000 wealthy classes in the Philippines, but the strike of the food problem is keenly felt by more than 15 million Filipinos. Now the US forces have completely withdrawn from the Philippines, leaving a huge gap that urgently needs to be filled by the people of East Asia themselves!

The Economic Structure of the Philippines Before the War

Under the planned management of the Seven Righteous Capital of the American Empire, the economic structure of the Philippines presents the characteristics of a modern colonial economy, becoming an independent market for American investment commodities and one of the sources of raw materials and labor needed by the United States. The economic structure fully expresses its dependence on the United States. Therefore, although the Philippines has always boasted of being the most civilized country in the European and American colonies of Nanyang and expected to build a republican federation independent in July 1946, regardless of politics, the colonial nature of the economy is obviously not easy to get rid of. Therefore, it has established state-owned companies centered on the National Development Company, promoted national economic guarantee movements in an attempt to realize industrialization, promoted the autonomy of the retail industry in commerce, and established local development bureaus to promote the construction of modern rural movements. All of these Philippine economic autonomy and rationalization movements cannot naturally be achieved in a short period of time, and the war has also buried all these plans and undertakings.

The unsoundness of the Philippine economy is the result of the US imperialist policy towards the Philippines. Although the United States is the advocate of the open door and equal opportunity in East Asia, in its colony of the Philippines, it has adopted the opposite principle of closed doors and unequal opportunities, completely monopolizing trade, currency, and investment capital. This is the biggest reason for the uneven development of the Philippine economy—its weakness in terms of durability in the face of changes in the economic environment. This is not just a theory, but there are many concrete facts to prove it:

(1) The Philippine economy is based on agriculture. The lifeline of the Philippine economy is exclusively on export trade to the United States. This export trade is mainly and most heavily concentrated on agricultural products such as sugar. Therefore, its basic industry cannot but be agriculture.

Although the influence of the United States on the Philippines is extremely modern in terms of politics and culture, modern industries such as heavy industry and the chemical industry are completely lacking, and its economy presents the characteristics of a colonial economy. In terms of agricultural products, raw materials and semi-finished products are exported from primary industries such as forestry, fisheries, and mining, while the United States supplies finished products and some semi-finished products to the Philippines. The most important exports are agricultural products such as sugar, coconut, hemp, and tobacco.

(2) The commercialization of agricultural exports. Due to the above characteristics, the scale of Philippine agriculture and its export commodity status can be seen from the following table: (1940 figures)

As can be seen from the above table, the important agricultural products other than rice and corn are completely export commodities. For example, the harvest price of sugarcane is 113 million pesos, and the value of exporting it as sugar is 100 million pesos, which shows that domestic sales are extremely small. Coconut, tobacco, Manila hemp, etc. also have the same tendency. On the one hand, the main food grains, such as rice, the harvest volume is insufficient for domestic demand, and every year it relies on imports from abroad. However, during the Spanish-American War in 1897, it was one of the important exports of the Philippines. Since the American rule, it has been transformed into imported goods. In 1912, the import amount was 26 million pesos, reaching 836 million tons in 1939! The import amount of food such as rice and wheat flour accounted for 20% of the total imports, presenting the contradictory phenomenon that an agricultural country cannot be self-sufficient in food.

(3) The impact of the US trade currency policy on the Philippines. Industries such as sugar, coconut, tobacco, and hemp were already prosperous industries before the United States occupied the Philippines, that is, under Spanish rule. US imperialism's policy towards the Philippines has further implemented tariff preferences for these products (completely tax-free since 1913), purchased them in large quantities, and at the same time promoted high-priced US goods to the Philippines. As a result, it is very profitable to plant these crops and sell them to the United States, which invisibly encourages planting; on the other hand, other crops are gradually ignored because there is no profit to be made or little profit to be made. On the one hand, agriculture that exports to the United States, such as sugar, coconut, hemp, and tobacco, has developed abnormally even though it has little to do with the country, on the other hand, the population is increasing year by year, while food production is decreasing day by day.

(4) The proportion of the four major industries. The position of the above four major industries in the Philippine economy is as follows:

(A) Sugar industry: Philippine sugar accounts for 60% of exports, and the total investment in cultivation and production is US$265.75 million (US$1 is equivalent to 2 pesos). The livelihoods of about 2.5 million Philippine people are directly and indirectly maintained by the sugar industry. Most of the Philippine government's income is the tax on the sugar industry. 40% of the income of the state-owned Manila Railway Company is sugar freight.

(B) Coconut industry: It accounts for 17% of exports, with a capital of US$220 million, and about 4 million islanders directly rely on it for a living.

(C) Hemp industry: The product accounts for 13% of exports, and the investment in production and improvement costs is US$185 million. About 2.5 million people rely on it for food and clothing.

(D) Tobacco industry: It accounts for 4% of export trade, with an investment of 21 million US dollars in cultivation land and improvement costs. About 500,000 islanders rely on it for a living.

It can be seen that 8 million people, that is, more than half of the total population, directly and indirectly rely on these four export industries for a living. In this way, the United States can smoothly implement its policy of dominance over the Philippines. But in the Philippines itself, this uneven economic development can be said to be a national tragedy.

### Puffer Fish Ban Campaign: China Film Drama Association Compiles Picture Strips for Promotion

The Public Works Department has completely banned the sale of puffer fish because citizens often suffer from poisoning due to greed for puffer fish, and plans to promote the puffer fish ban campaign to raise awareness among the general public. However, in view of the fact that many citizens are still obsessed, in order to promote publicity, it has commissioned the Shenhua Film Drama Association in the city to compile film scripts, and will use the publicity method of film dramas to achieve results. It is heard that the Health Department presented two puffer fish to the association the day before yesterday so that photos could be taken for scriptwriters to refer to.

### Recent News from the Guangzhao Public Hall

The Guangzhao Public Hall in this port is organized by fellow villagers of the Guangzhao two prefectures in Guangdong Province who are traveling in Shanghai. It has a long history and has made outstanding achievements in running charity and education projects. After the incident, Mr. Wen Qinpu succeeded as chairman and handled the resettlement of refugees, which was not without benefit. Although Mr. Wen is now in power in the central government, he still strives for the affairs of the association. In difficult times, the organization of various undertakings has never been abandoned for a day. In recent years, with financial changes and the value of goods changing, the association has been able to settle its debts in a timely manner. The income and expenditure accounts over the years are printed in the creditworthiness record, which is well-organized. During the incident, many of the public properties were requisitioned by friendly agencies or confiscated as enemy properties, such as 450 mu of land in the New Mountain Villa in Dachang, 116 mu of land in the Old Mountain Villa in Chedaigiao, the entire school building of the Guangzhao Public School in Yokohama Bridge, and dozens of houses in Fudeli on North Sichuan Road, which have been recovered through negotiations. Other public properties of fellow villagers, such as the Guangzhao Hospital and the Yuanji Shantang, have also been returned to their original owners, and a great deal has been preserved. All of this was obtained by Mr. Wen through negotiations with friendly nations. In terms of educational undertakings, the Guangzhao Girls' School under its jurisdiction has never stopped singing and chanting. The Guangzhao Yixue School also resumed classes this spring. It is not easy to maintain such a state in the current environment. The public hall has a total of 23 directors, including old directors such as Guo Shun, Lao Jingxiu, Huang Hongjun, Zhang Rongpu, Wu Queting, and new directors such as Liang Haishou, Cheng Jinxiu, Li Shaoxuan, and Chen Ripeng, all of whom are well-known figures in the Guangdong community.

### Promoting Contributions to the National Government's Finances: The Future Task of the National Policy Company

After the National Government joined the war, the task of the Sino-Japanese joint venture National Policy Company was to increase major resources to assist the National Government financially. Regarding this issue, President Kodama and Vice President Hirazawa of the Central China Revitalization Corporation consulted with the authorities of various related companies to formulate concrete plans, expand the organization of companies affiliated with the Central China Revitalization Corporation, and strengthen their financial and personnel ties. According to the company, before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the business policy of the National Policy Company was to focus on restoring industries destroyed by the war. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, its business policy had to be reformed, especially after the National Government joined the war, which increased the mission of the National Policy Company. Financial contributions to the National Government have become an absolute necessity. The targets are the following three points: (1) Paying interest on the National Government's shares; (2) Levying taxes on the National Policy Company; (3) Indirectly assisting the National Government by increasing production methods. Regarding this matter, all parties have reviewed it, and the contents are roughly as follows: The payment of interest on the National Government's shares is being prepared by each company, and some companies have already paid in full. Regarding the interest payable to the National Government, some companies have been established due to special circumstances and have not yet paid, but all of them have been completely settled and used as public reserves. The total amount of interest from the thirteen companies is quite large. Once this amount is returned to the National Government, the National Government's finances will inevitably be strengthened. From this point of view, the National Policy Company's contribution to the National Government's finances is significant. (Continental News)

Economic Commentary

### Implementation of Wartime Economic Policy Outline is More Important Than Principles

The Wartime Economic Policy Outline, which was recently decided by the National Economic Conference and officially promulgated by the National Government on the 14th of this month, has been published in various newspapers and is already well known to readers. In summary, its contents are as follows: (1) Regarding increasing production, it is nothing more than the development of agriculture, minerals, military and civilian industries, and the guarantee of legitimate income for agricultural and industrial producers; (2) Regarding regulating prices, it is nothing more than improving transportation and distribution, reducing intermediate classes, cracking down on speculation and hoarding, and maintaining reasonable ratios between various prices; (3) Regarding saving consumers, it is nothing more than encouraging the manufacture of substitutes, restricting the production of luxury goods, cracking down on unnecessary consumption, and implementing fixed quota distribution; (4) Regarding stabilizing currency value and regulating finance, it is nothing more than strengthening financial institutions, encouraging people to save, promoting industrial lending, advocating the internal transfer of funds, and fundamentally coordinating currency value stabilization with increased productivity; (5) Regarding reforming economic institutions, it is nothing more than adjusting, reorganizing, and uniting the various stages of various industrial sectors, and implementing autonomous control or group management of healthy and major industries. Reading this in detail, it is not only the key to wartime economy, but also the economic policies for establishing a country are all prepared here.

The strategy of a country and a government is often swayed by its political background. Therefore, benevolence and wisdom are seen alternately, and each person differs in their views and judgments according to their different perspectives and positions. This outline is truly a summary and concise, without a single word mentioning politics. Regardless of which party, which faction, South, North, East, or West, I am afraid that no one would not regard this policy as a crucial plan for China.

However, it is easy to set principles, but difficult to make plans; it is easy to write an outline, but difficult to formulate details. It is even easier to make plans as an outline, but it is even more difficult to implement them. I have heard that the government has ordered relevant departments to properly formulate measures and implement them effectively. It can be seen that the importance of this matter lies not in empty talk, but in implementation. As for the difficulties in implementation, I am afraid there are more than just a few. If difficulties are not overcome, success will be difficult to achieve. Whether difficulties can be overcome depends on whether the government is working hard, whether all parties are sincere, and on the cooperation of officials and people, and the design of experts in various industries. Only in this way will the outline not become a tool for decoration.

### Rising Prices of Industrial Raw Materials: Urgent Need to Plan Countermeasures

Recently, the general price level in the Shanghai area has risen about twice as high as before the Lunar New Year. This phenomenon is also very evident in various industrial raw materials. For example, the price of thin iron sheets, a raw material for ironwork, has also shown a rise. Before the Lunar New Year, it was 30,000 yuan per ton, but now it has reached more than 45,000 yuan. Situations like this have a profound and significant impact on Chinese factories, and an urgent countermeasure must be planned. (China Intelligence)

### Chongqing Focuses on Developing Northwest Resources Due to the Dim Prospect of Reopening the滇緬 (Yunnan-Burma) Road

An Alliance News Agency Guangzhou dispatch on February 18 stated: The Chongqing regime is currently actively engaged in promoting the development of Northwest resources, and therefore, despite the assistance of Britain and the United States, there is no hope of reopening the滇緬 (Yunnan-Burma) Road. It is recently learned that Chongqing has specifically designated a week starting from January 15 as Northwest Resources Development Promotion Week. All radio stations, newspapers, and various publications are simultaneously conducting large-scale propaganda to awaken the people's awareness of the importance of developing Northwest natural resources.

### Government Bonds Continue to Rise: All at 80 Yuan

The market for government bonds continued to rise yesterday. All unified government bonds have broken through the 80 yuan mark. There were more buyers than sellers. At the time of settlement, sellers were slow to deliver the goods. Category C bonds initially traded at 3.5 yuan, then fell to 2.3 yuan, and rose to 6.4 yuan, finally settling at 6.2 yuan. It is said that after the market closed, prices were even higher. The other four types traded as follows: Category A at 4.5 yuan, Category B at 3 yuan, Category D at 0.05 yuan, and Category E at 2.5 yuan. The market price of Category C bonds has reached above the high price before August 13, 1937.

### 銀錢業 (Banking Industry) Will Still Revert to Opening at 9:00 AM

### The Development of Currency Work in Central China (3): The Impact of the Concurrent Circulation of Military Scrip and Reserve Notes

Reserve notes, which have the mission of unifying the currency system of Central and Southern China, have made the currency system of Central China more complicated since their appearance in January of the 29th year of the Republic (1940). These reserve notes developed alongside military scrip, and by the end of August of the year before last (1942), the amount issued had reached 100 million yuan. After the issuance of the fund freezing order, the amount issued expanded for the same reasons as the military scrip mentioned above, reaching 160 million yuan by the end of November, 360 million yuan by the end of December, and approaching 500 million yuan by the end of March last year after the abolition of the new sale of legal tender at par. By September, when the work of fully recovering the old legal tender came to an end, it had reached 1.6 billion yuan, and by November it had already exceeded 2 billion yuan. Of course, this is an extremely gratifying and commendable thing, but what we need to study here is what kind of impact the current concurrent circulation of military scrip and reserve notes has on the economic situation in Central China.

In theory, reserve notes are the currency of the Nanjing National Government, and military scrip is the currency generated by the Japanese Empire to purchase necessary materials and labor during combat. Probably no one disagrees with this point. If we simply take the current situation in Central China as a prerequisite, the original mission mentioned above will not encounter difficulties. However, when working together to replace the old legal tender, many problems arise between military scrip and reserve notes. Here, we examine the economic impact of the two-unit system of military scrip and reserve notes. First, we need to recognize that reserve notes inevitably cause the phenomenon of military scrip reflux.

First, from a fundamental perspective, the two-unit system of military scrip and reserve notes is not a good phenomenon, whether it is for the unification of economic work in Central China or for the psychological impact on the Chinese people. Now that the Japanese Empire and the National Government have become one, not only are they fighting together in military battles, but they must also cooperate with each other in economic warfare. In the same economic camp resisting the old legal tender system, two different currencies are dividing the territory and each going their own way. Can the expected effect still be achieved? This is reflected in the psychology of the Chinese people, and may also have a negative impact on the spiritual unity and cooperation between Japan and China. We should remember the significant role that the Chiang regime's currency unification work played in unifying the Chinese people's hearts and minds, and in further unifying China's politics and economy, before and after the July 7th Incident. This is why we hope to create a unified currency system to replace the old legal tender in the vast territory of Central China, Southern China, and Northern China (not limited to Central China) as much as possible.

Second, looking at the surface of the development of currency work, the concurrent circulation of reserve notes and military scrip only strengthens the counterattack force of the old legal tender, and weakens the effectiveness of the two provinces in resisting the old legal tender. In the same peaceful area, there are two currencies, reserve notes and military scrip, each with its own sphere of influence. Objectively speaking, the lack of concentration or dispersion of power and effectiveness weakens the potential for currency warfare.

Third, from the standpoint of stabilizing commerce and flexible transactions, the two-unit currency system is also not an ideal goal. Finally, the legal exchange rate between military scrip and reserve notes is 18 to 100, and there is generally no major discrepancy in the general market, and speculative phenomena seem to have disappeared. Although in the previous stage, reserve notes were an excellent speculative object——G——G), it cannot be said that there is no room for speculation in military scrip and reserve notes. Moreover, it cannot stabilize commerce and hinders commodity transactions and the revitalization of industry. We will not talk about speculation for the time being, but if we consider the flexibility of transactions, the two-unit currency system requires two calculation methods and two ledgers, which only increases complexity and confusion, and is of no benefit.

### Brokers, the "Enemies of Prices," to Be Eliminated by the Authorities

Although the Japanese-Chinese authorities have taken various decisive measures to solve the price problem that threatens people's lives, the existence of brokers who seek huge profits between producers and consumers has significantly promoted price increases. In view of this, the consulate police station, the 工部局 (Shanghai Municipal Council) Economic Police, and the Municipal Social Bureau have decided to work together closely to eliminate brokers. Because the authorities believe that the existence of brokers is one of the reasons why the policy of suppressing prices has led to a gradual rise in prices, it is heard that they will engage in active crackdowns.

### Black Market for Gold Bars Likely to Be Eliminated After Authorities Take Decisive Measures

According to reports received by a Datong News Agency reporter from well-informed sources, the recent surge in the black market for gold has once again attracted close attention from the authorities. It is heard that the authorities are extremely indignant at the speculative merchants' manipulation of gold prices and are currently collecting detailed reports on the activities of these people as a basis for imposing severe punishments in the future. According to relevant parties, the authorities' resolute adoption of this decisive measure is not only due to the soaring black market for gold bars, which is sufficient to stimulate a general rise in prices, but also the silver industry's request to relax the price limit on gold ornaments is also a major factor in prompting this action. The only reason cited by the silver industry for requesting a relaxation of the price limit is that they are losing money, and the reason for their losses is based on the soaring black market for gold bars. According to investigations by the Datong News Agency reporter, the market price of gold bars was restricted by the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities on January 8 of this year, set at 27,500 yuan, while the price limit for gold ornaments was verbally stipulated by Sheng Yudu, the director-general of the Shanghai Municipal Council, when he met with representatives of the silver industry on January 11, set at 3,000 yuan. Recently, some silver shops have raised the selling price of gold ornaments, which has led to severe punishment. It is expected that if the black market for gold bars can be completely eradicated, not only can it be expected that general prices will no longer be subjected to unexpected stimulation, but the problem of the silver industry's request to relax the price limit on gold ornaments will also be solved.

### Japanese Textile Industry Advocates Two Methods for Purchasing Cotton in Central China

The Japanese textile industry attaches great importance to the sluggish purchase of cotton in Central China. Recently, based on the decision of the East Asia Textile Industry Association, it notified the Shanghai branch of the Textile Industry in China to promptly find ways to promote purchases. After receiving this notice, the Shanghai branch deeply felt the importance of this matter and specially petitioned the authorities on the 18th, requesting understanding. The gist of its petition is: Under the current official price, the most effective and appropriate method is to allocate purchase bonuses and implement a barter system. Other than this, there is no good way to promote purchases. (Continental News, 20th)

### Chongqing Levies New Taxes: Income Tax Levied on Monthly Salaries Exceeding 100 Yuan

A Haitian News Agency Macau dispatch on the 20th stated: The Chongqing regime has promulgated a new income tax law as follows: Those with monthly salaries exceeding 100 yuan must pay income tax according to progressive tax rates. Profits not exceeding 10% of the capital amount may be tax-exempt. Interest on government bonds and bank deposits will be subject to a 5% tax, while income from interest on corporate bonds and non-government bonds will be subject to a 10% tax.

### Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau Issues Two New Fixed-Amount Money Orders with Lower Remittance Fees Than Ordinary Ones

The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has issued a notice regarding the issuance of new fixed-amount money orders. It states, "Two new fixed-amount money orders of 50 yuan and 100 yuan have now been printed and are being issued simultaneously with the existing fixed-amount money orders of 5 yuan, 10 yuan, and 15 yuan. The remittance fees for these fixed-amount money orders are all lower than those for ordinary money orders. The procedures for purchasing and exchanging them are also simpler than those for ordinary money orders. When purchasing, the remitter only needs to verbally state the amount of the money order and where it is being remitted to the issuer, without having to fill out a "money order purchase slip." After the issuer hands over the money order, they will fill in the name of the payee on the face of the ticket and then seal and mail it to the payee. If there are air routes in the middle, the letter containing the fixed-amount money order can also be sent by airmail, so that the payee can exchange the remittance earlier without having to pay extra airfare as when purchasing ordinary money orders. After the payee receives the fixed-amount money order, they only need to sign and stamp the back of the money order to immediately receive the remittance from the exchange bureau, unlike the ordinary money order method, which requires waiting for the exchange bureau to receive the verification document (i.e., the stub) sent by the issuing bureau before the money can be exchanged. For other details, please inquire with the bureau's staff."

### Demand for United Notes is Relatively Weak

### Suppressing Prices Is Imminent: Authorities Hope for Cooperation from Citizens, Encourage Production and Business, and Do Not Hoard

Okazaki Katsuo, the director-general of the Shanghai Municipal Council, issued a statement the other day to suppress the rising tide of prices, urging the银钱业 (Banking Industry) to stop lending to non-productive businesses. The relevant authorities have recently further indicated that they will encourage major industries to improve the situation. Citizens must implement the following measures to cooperate: (1) Focus on the operation of productive businesses. (2) Individuals should only purchase essential items for practical use. (3) Do not hoard any goods. (4) Rather than engaging in the distribution of finished products, focus on investing in genuine production businesses. (5) Do not engage in speculation in goods and stocks to seek exorbitant profits. (6) Carefully study various investments based on the percentage of previous dividends and profits, and do not rely on impressions and rumors. Before investing, you should also carefully examine the company's balance sheet and profit and loss statement. If citizens can implement the above measures, not only can the high prices be suppressed, but the assets that are currently owned and will be acquired in the future will also be guaranteed.

### Hua Central Tobacco Rationing Association to Begin Rationing from March 1st

The Hua Central Tobacco Rationing Association, in order to uniformly manage cigarette rationing and eliminate the black market, organized the registration of all cigarette retailers in the city, which ended at the end of January. It has now been reviewed and will be submitted to the board of directors for approval next week. The association will begin rationing on March 1st. The cigarettes to be rationed include: (1) those produced by the Gu Zhong Tobacco Company under military management, (2) those produced by the Japanese-owned Zhonghua Tobacco Company, and (3) those produced by Chinese companies such as Da Dong, Nan Yang, Hua Cheng, and Fu Xin. Rationing and retail prices will be set, and legitimate profits will be granted to each retailer. The authorities will strictly crack down on black market transactions. Any retailer found to be raising prices will have their rationing rights permanently revoked and will be severely punished. It is also reported that, in light of the soaring black market prices of cigarettes, the association, in addition to the authorities taking measures to crack down, decided to have the original dispatching agencies, such as Yongtaihe Company dispatching British American Tobacco, Huayuan Tobacco Firm dispatching Japanese Zhonghua Tobacco, and Nan Yang and Huacheng dispatching Chinese tobacco, each dispatch another batch of goods this month before the official rationing begins in order to stabilize prices. From March onwards, the association will distribute according to the registered forms.

### No Shortage of Sugar Supply

Since the beginning of this year, 160,000 bags have been imported, and it is expected that 100,000 bags will be imported each month to supply the city's needs. Therefore, there is no need to worry about a shortage of sugar.

### Points to Note for the Establishment of a Limited Company (3)

(A) Key points of legal regulations.

5. Number of Directors Article 138 of the Company Law stipulates: "A company shall have a minimum of five directors, who shall be elected from among the shareholders by the shareholders' meeting." Therefore, the articles of association should clearly specify the number of directors. For example, if the company is set to have nine directors, it should be stated that there are nine directors; if the number has not been decided and the articles of association state "nine or eleven directors," this is not in accordance with the law. The number of directors must be an odd number; an even number is also illegal.

6. Issuance of Shares Article 114 of the Company Law states: "A company shall not issue shares unless it has been registered. If shares are issued in violation of the preceding paragraph, the shares shall be invalid; however, the holder of the shares may claim damages from the issuer of the shares." Therefore, a company must issue shares after completing the establishment registration. However, since the establishment registration takes considerable time, the receipts for the share payments held by the shareholders must be properly kept for future exchange for shares.

7. Remuneration of Directors and Supervisors Articles 140 and 153 of the Company Law stipulate: "The remuneration of directors and supervisors shall be determined by the shareholders' meeting unless otherwise specified in the articles of association." Therefore, if the articles of association contain explicit provisions, the remuneration can be paid according to the articles of association; if the articles of association do not clearly specify, the amount must be approved by the shareholders' meeting and cannot be withdrawn arbitrarily.

8. Establishment Registration Article 109 of the Company Law stipulates that if all shares are subscribed for by the promoters, the directors shall, within 15 days after the completion of the capital verification by the competent authority; if the shares are not subscribed for by the promoters, the directors shall, within 15 days after the completion of the incorporation meeting, apply to the competent authority for registration of the following matters: (1) the name of the company, (2) the business operated, (3) the total amount of shares and the amount of each share, (4) the location of the head office and branches, and (5) the method for the company to make announcements; (2) the amount of capital already paid for each share, (3) the names and addresses of the directors and supervisors, and (4) if there are reasons for dissolution, the reasons. According to Articles 2, 3, and 7 of the Company Registration Rules, the competent authority is the Department of Industry in the province (now under the jurisdiction of the Department of Construction), and the Bureau of Social Affairs in the special municipality; the application for registration and attachments must be prepared in duplicate, and after review by the competent authority, they will be submitted to the Ministry of Industry for approval and registration, and a license will be issued. When these procedures are completed, the legal procedures for establishing a company are completed.

### Analysis of the Changes in Hua Stock Prices from the Beginning to the End of 1942

(2) Comparison of the annual market price of Dasheng Factory No. 1, 3, and 2, which has the highest rise

Over the past year or so, if we only consider the multiples of the rise and fall of Chinese stocks, Dasheng Yarn Factory No. 1, 3, and 2 in Nantong can be said to be the most prominent. The market price of Dasheng Factory No. 1 at the beginning of last year was 20 yuan at the last time, which was still the selling price, but recently it has exceeded 600 yuan; it has surged by 30 times in the past thirteen months. The lowest price of Factory No. 3 at the beginning of last year was 25 yuan, and now it has also exceeded 500 yuan, reaching 20 times; both are amazing. The left figure shows the upward trend of the stock prices of these two stocks.

### Time

— Yu Tian

In the process of time, there are three stages: "present," "past," and "future."

The past has no meaning, even though it is full of traces of "experience," but it is mostly old and corrupt, and not worth reviewing. When a person recalls the past, it often makes him sad, because the scars of life will cause him hidden pain. If the past is perfect, it will make him uninterested in reality and lose the will to live, lingering in the past, only seeking comfort in dreams, thus becoming decadent, annoyed, passive, and not striving for progress. So only thinking about the past is somewhat toxic.

The future is too vague, living in the imaginary kingdom, although it is ethereal and infinitely happy, but once you open your eyes, the scenery in front of you is completely different. You can't help but sigh and curse the world, thus becoming indulgent, disappointed, pessimistic, and deviating from the normal course of life, with a sad face, as if everything is impossible, and even destroying your own life, willingly becoming a "martyr." So looking forward to the future is ultimately empty.

I think the most precious thing is the present, which is neither toxic nor empty. Working hard in a down-to-earth manner is the most valuable. However, the "present" also encounters different "smooth" and "adversity." We must remember that in "smooth" times, we must arrange things well, and in "adversity," we must struggle at all costs. We must know that the "present" will become the "past" in the near future, and it was also the "future" not long ago. Therefore, as long as we strive to obtain a perfect "present," we don't need to caress the scars of the past, nor do we need to build castles in the air.

The voyage of life advances in the sea of time, and it is inevitable that there will be dangerous winds and waves. A veteran boatman certainly accepts the lessons of the past and predicts the safety of the future, but most importantly, he knows that he must hold the rudder firmly and move forward inch by inch, bravely and resolutely towards the other shore.

### A Dismissed Child

— Shi Jun

One of the Teacher's Diary Social Problems? Children's Problems?

Yesterday, the school held a temporary school affairs meeting. Because I am the homeroom teacher of the fifth and sixth grades, and the discussion this time was about the fifth and sixth grades, I had to attend even though I had taken a week of sick leave.

In addition to the director of education, Wu, the attendees were all teachers who taught the fifth and sixth grades. Wu first reported that Cao Zulong—the most mischievous child in the fifth grade—had committed a major crime the day before yesterday: stealing a fountain pen from the girl Wang Ruixiang. Cao Zulong's classmate Huang Linbao informed on him, and after Qing San's questioning and investigation, "the offender" himself also "frankly admitted."

Therefore, in order to maintain school spirit and warn others, Wu advocated expulsion. Shen, Lin, and Tang all agreed. I, of course, had nothing to say and followed the majority opinion.

So a letter was immediately sent to "Dear Parent."

Today, when I dragged my newly recovered body to class, there was an empty seat in the third row, and I didn't see that familiar, active black face.

As if I had lost something, I was stunned for a long time. I didn't talk to the children about Cao Zulong's matter, because maybe I couldn't talk them out of it. Cao Zulong's activity was often praised by me, and he got along well with most of the students. His intelligence and strength made him a leader.

I also vaguely saw melancholy and sadness on their innocent little faces—they probably already knew about it.

But what surprised me was that when I walked into the alley that evening, a small hand grabbed me in the dark.

"It's me, Mr. Shi!" The familiar, active voice was even more in the dark.

"Cao Zulong?"

"Yes! Mr. Shi!" The voice was a little different.

I took him back to my house.

"What are you doing here so late?" I was very strange.

"Mr. Shi!" Under the light, I saw tearful eyes full of tears on the sad black face, and there was no longer the active and brave look: "Can you... let me... continue to study?..."

"..." I shook my head coldly.

"Mr. Shi!..." He almost cried out.

"Who told you to steal other students' things!" I looked at the table, "There's nothing I can do about it!"

"I know it's my... my fault!" A trembling hand wiped the tears that flowed down: "But this... this is not... I'm willing to do it... There's nothing I can do..."

"What? Who forced you?" I was even stranger.

"Father said: The rent for three months... hasn't been paid!" The sobbing voice was intermittent, "...Now it's the end of the year,... if you don't pay... you'll be... driven... out... But father... hasn't done business for four months!... Not a penny..."

"But you shouldn't steal other people's things because of this!"

"Old Ma next door mentioned occasionally last time... he saw someone buy a fountain pen for twenty yuan... The rent for three months is only... only fifty-four yuan... It happened to fall on the ground... I just... Who knew... Father sold it to someone for only thirty yuan!... It's still not enough!..."

I was silent.

"...I don't know how... Huang Linbao saw it... Yesterday... Mr. Wu and Mr. Shen... asked me... Mr. Shi used to say... honesty is the best... so I said it... Now... they've..."

He suddenly began to sob on the table.

"What's the use of crying?"

"This... it's not... I'm... willing!" He stopped his tears, took out a very wrinkled two-jiao note from his pocket, and put it in front of me without hesitation: "I'm now... going to save... enough thirty yuan... to... return it to her... Mr. Shi, please keep it for me..."

"Okay!" I stared at the old jiao note that had been caressed for a long time.

"—So can I continue to study?" The black face full of tears looked at my face like a prisoner awaiting the final verdict, and his eyes were full of hope.

"..." I shook my head in silence.

A layer of despair immediately covered the black face, and the hope in his eyes disappeared suddenly.

"Mr. Shi! Thank you!"—It was the last struggle: "...I've been waiting in the alley for a long time!"

"..." I shook my head in silence.

He looked at everything in the room in despair, and finally silently walked out of the room, walked down the stairs, and silently walked out of the back door.

I went out with him.

"You shouldn't have abandoned a smart, honest, and quickly repentant child!"—A voice like iron rang in my ears.

"Cao Zulong!" I called out. "You—you come to my place every night!"

At first he stared at me blankly, as if he didn't understand, and finally threw himself on me:

"Mr. Shi! You're really..."

"Go back!"

"I'll bring two jiao tomorrow!" At the entrance of the alley, he suddenly turned around and shouted loudly.

### Small Bowl and Little Rice, How Can It Be Enough?

— Written by Tianming

### Thoughts After Reading "The Law of Preserving Wealth"

— Tang Jingde

After reading Mr. Nie Yuntai's "The Law of Preserving Wealth," I was very moved and couldn't help but write something to show off. I remember when I was a child, I often heard my grandfather talk to people saying, "I have worked hard all my life, and I have no money or land to pass on to my children. What's the use of a wise descendant? What's the use of an unwise descendant? It's better to accumulate virtue in the dark, so that descendants can enjoy it endlessly." His old man's intention was: If good descendants are born, they will earn money to live on their own, so why use money, land, and other inheritances; if bad descendants are born, even if the father has a generous inheritance, it can be squandered in an instant, then what's the use of it, wouldn't it harm the descendants instead? (Examples of wealth can be seen in Mr. Nie's "The Law of Preserving Wealth") Therefore, accumulating virtue in the dark can make descendants use it endlessly and take it inexhaustibly.

Then here we have to ask, what is "accumulating virtue"? Accumulating virtue is the only way to preserve wealth. The most concise answer is to not harm others to benefit oneself, and further, to help others and even relieve them according to the environment, which is accumulating virtue. Because everyone can look down on rights and emphasize obligations, and everyone takes service as the first priority and helping others as the goal, wouldn't it directly help oneself and save oneself? The ancients said: "Helping others helps oneself," which is what it means.

Speaking of helping others and relieving them, there is also a word "love" in between, because without a loving heart, there is no way to talk about helping others and relieving them. For example, if you meet a beggar on the road who is begging you, you have already developed a feeling of disgust for his appearance, and before he opens his mouth, you have already waved your hand and told him to get out, then how can you relieve him? The reason is very simple, there is a lack of "love"—a sense of compassion. However, if you can experience Confucius's saying "take analogies nearby," then you will be very willing to help him. The meaning is: You compare yourself to the beggar at the time, and at the same time, you consider the beggar as a rich person, and you ask him to beg, and he waves his hand and tells you to get out, do you feel embarrassed? After such consideration, you will be willing to give generously.

Confucius said: "Love the multitude and be close to the benevolent." To ask people to broadly love the masses is close to "benevolence." The word "benevolence" comes from one person, and anything that expresses compassion can be called "benevolence." Han Tuizhi explained it most thoroughly in "The Original Way," saying: "Broad love is called benevolence." Jesus also said: "Love your neighbor as yourself." Everyone loves themselves, as well as their parents, wives, and children, and they are relatively distant to their relatives and friends, and even more different to strangers. Mencius said: "Respect the old of your family, and extend it to the old of others; love the young of your family, and extend it to the young of others." Extrapolate and extend it, from loving your own parents and children to loving other people's parents and children. You must know that everyone has food to eat, and then you have food to eat; everyone can live in peace and be happy to work, and then you can have a comfortable life, otherwise, if you are rich alone and people are poor, even if you are unwilling to give relief, won't the poor stand up and take risks, and won't you be directly harmed? In other words, wealth cannot be preserved. This is the consequence of not being able to extend love to others.

At this time, there are quite a few profiteers in Shanghai. Once they get rich, they only seek to satisfy their desires, and then seek excessive enjoyment in material and spiritual terms. They don't care about the future, they don't care about their descendants, and they don't care about the masses who can't afford to eat. They have goods, and they hope for high prices. The ancients accumulated grain to relieve famine, but today people hoard goods to wait for prices. This situation is really incomparable.

To be honest: A person comes with empty hands and leaves with empty hands, it just depends on what kind of career he has done. Some are unheard of in the world; some have a name that will last forever; some descendants will not decline for generations; some descendants are unknown. It depends on how each person does it. Liang Chenggong said: "The happiest thing in life is to fulfill one's responsibilities." This "responsibility" is the "thing" that is responsible for oneself, for others, and for the society and the country, and can also be said to be service. To do a job from beginning to end, to be diligent and hardworking in service, is to fulfill one's responsibility. When responsibility is fulfilled, one is relaxed and feels infinite comfort and happiness in spirit.

The ancients said: "Doing good is joyful." "Doing good" is fulfilling one's responsibility to others, that is, helping others and relieving others; indirectly fulfilling one's responsibility to the society and the country. Because responsibility is fulfilled, it is most joyful. I also often hear old people say: "It is better to have a broad mind than a wide house." A wide house is being wealthy. However, wealthy people do not necessarily have a broad mind, and people with a broad mind can lead to a wide house. It turns out that a broad mind is doing good; doing good is fulfilling responsibility; fulfilling responsibility can be said to be "virtue"; accumulating virtue is the only way to preserve wealth. So my conclusion is:

Benefiting others is benefiting oneself,

Why not scatter wealth instead of preserving it?

### Humility

— Qi Wu

We should humbly learn from others' good examples.

Regardless of ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, whether they are our friends or enemies, we should imitate others' strengths.

Choosing strengths to make up for weaknesses is precisely a work that each of us should do.

### The Teacher of All Ages (16)

— Written by James Hilton, translated by Yi Jin

"Uh, Gregson—ahem—I remember you—ahem—you're slow at everything—aren't you? Maybe you'll grow up to be—ahem—like me—old—ahem—also slow—aren't you?" Afterwards, when he was alone again, Mrs. Wiggatt came in to clear away the tea set, and he had to say: "Mrs. Wiggatt, young Gregson was here—ahem—you remember him, don't you? The tall one with glasses. Always slow. Ahem. Working in the League of Nations—ahem—there—I think—his—ahem—slowness—isn't necessarily noticeable—is it?"

Sometimes, when the roll call bell rang, he would walk to the window and look out through the fence of the roadside school, looking far away to see those students lined up in a long line, passing the bench. New times, new names... But everything old still remains... Jefferson, Jennings, Jolyon, Jupo, Kingsley Primus, Kingsley Secundus, Kingsley Tertius, Kingston... You're all there, where have you all gone?... Mrs. Wiggatt, give me another cup of tea before prep, I'm sorry, can you?

The ten years after the Great War, a chaotic change and adjustment swept past; Jipps was in it, looking around, and felt greatly disappointed. Ruhr, Chanak, Corfu; there were enough restless events in the world. However, close to him, in Brookfield, and even broadly speaking, in England, there were still things that fascinated him, because they were old—and had seen the vicissitudes of life. He gradually saw more and more that the other world was a big mess, and England was pastoral enough for it—perhaps too much. But he was content with Brookfield. Many things have been tested by the times and the changes of war, and the foundation of Brookfield is deeply rooted in these things. (42)

Cold light, also known as short-wave ultraviolet light, is a translation of Cold Quartz, which is slightly different from ordinary violet light lamps. According to the setting of ordinary violet light lamps, long-wave light is used, and part of the light power has been transformed into heat power, so the light emitted is very hot, and the transmission power is reduced accordingly, and the sterilization power is not very large. Cold light lamps are different. The light is cold and not hot, so it can exert full light power, and the transmission power is more than 30 times stronger than ordinary ultraviolet light, and the sterilization power is also strengthened somewhat. Therefore, for tubercle bacilli deep in the lungs, it can penetrate deeply into the skin and make its contribution, this is one: After irradiation with ordinary violet light lamps, the skin is easily blackened, and the existence of this black pigment can prevent the light from penetrating and reduce its effect. Cold light, with appropriate time, distance, and light intensity configuration, does not present this drawback, this is two: Therefore, cold light is the most modern therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis. Not only that, cold light can also test for the presence or absence of lung disease, and its effect is the same as X-ray fluoroscopy. The skin reactions presented by patients after irradiation are different for each person. The strength of the reaction can be used to measure the severity of lung disease. This is also a new discovery. Today, those who talk about the diagnosis and treatment of lung disease seem to be unable to diagnose without X-rays and cannot treat without air needles. It is not known that cold light actually has superior diagnostic and therapeutic effects. Fearing that the world has not noticed, I have described its general meaning as such.
