### Commentary on Price Control Measures and Wartime Economy

The relationship between price issues and the wartime economy is of utmost importance and need not be elaborated upon. However, specific solutions require experts to contribute their strengths and work together to achieve a reasonable resolution to the price problem. Therefore, we are providing detailed opinions and methods from the technical perspective of price control measures. It would be a blessing for the nation and its people if relevant parties could pay more attention and find even more comprehensive and appropriate solutions. Because the more thoroughly research and discussion are conducted at the beginning of implementing price controls, and the more meticulously plans are made, the faster and greater the success can be achieved, and the less inconvenience the people will experience. As long as price controls are implemented effectively and by capable personnel, the commonly worried problems such as the prevalence of black markets, the hiding of goods, and the reduction of production sources can be gradually reduced. However, to thoroughly implement the price control policy and stabilize prices, various other wartime economic policies must be coordinated and promoted to achieve significant results gradually. Because the price problem is inherently closely connected to all national economic measures and social dynamics. Price is a whole, and price control is just one aspect of the overall price control strategy. Therefore, the solution to the price problem must be achieved through the complete implementation of the entire price control strategy. Furthermore, the entire price control strategy is part of the overall national wartime economic policy, so it is necessary to coordinate the entire price control strategy with other wartime policies to achieve complete and satisfactory results. Comprehensive price control is the initial step in wartime economic control. It is necessary to further adopt mutually supportive economic and financial policies, such as comprehensive control of materials, development of production enterprises, economical consumption by officials and civilians during wartime, improvement of transportation, tightening of government budgets and currency, control of the financial sector, adjustment of taxes, and strict national organization. The government and relevant parties must immediately conduct research and discussion based on the actual situation and needs since the declaration of war, formulate implementation measures, and diligently promote them to achieve practical results. Among these, increasing production and saving consumption are the most urgent measures at present, and should be the focus of future price control strategies and must be implemented first.

The main element in the price control strategy is to increase wartime production; and wartime production is centered on agriculture, industry, and mining. It is hoped that the government will formulate detailed plans to increase production based on the outline of wartime economic policies and increase funding to promote wartime production. The key points of increasing production must be based on reality, focusing on goods necessary for the nation during wartime and for the people's daily lives. The increased production of materials should be prioritized in terms of variety, quantity, timing, and region, to meet urgent needs, supplement shortages, act according to capabilities, save time, labor, and capital, and fully meet the actual needs of wartime. For example, in terms of agricultural and forestry construction, in the agricultural sector, in addition to increasing grain production, equal importance should be given to cotton production, while rapeseed, silk, sugar cane, and tobacco should also be taken into consideration to ensure that the people's needs for food and clothing are met, and the nation has the necessary materials for wartime. In the forestry sector, in addition to general forest protection and construction of new forests, special attention should be paid to the new methods of logging timber for shipbuilding, to develop the shipbuilding industry and restore shipping along the Yangtze River, coastal areas, and inland rivers, to facilitate the regulation of materials in various regions in the future. Attention should also be given to the widespread cultivation of firewood and charcoal to supplement the shortage of fuel during wartime, which would benefit industry and transportation. In the livestock sector, in addition to improving the breeding of draft cattle and horses, attention should also be paid to the promotion of livestock and poultry such as pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, and fish farming, to supplement the national food supply, and to utilize their by-products to develop handicrafts. Furthermore, in terms of industrial production, for the needs of wartime, the scope of state-owned industries should naturally be expanded, but given the special circumstances in China's industrial history, enterprises under government supervision and private management may be more suitable for actual needs and achieve greater results. At the same time, the most important thing that should not be ignored is the support for small and medium-sized industries, and efforts should be made to promote and encourage handicrafts and household industries. The living standards of our general public are not high, and the products of handicrafts and household industries can solve the shortage of daily necessities for the majority of the people. Moreover, these products can also be used as raw materials for large industries and wartime military industries. However, increasing production should not only be promoted through government orders, but must also be assisted and protected in all aspects, such as the opening or increasing of agricultural and industrial loans in finance, the implementation of increased production loans, water conservancy loans, promotion loans, marketing loans, rural sideline loans, land finance loans, and so on. Protection should be provided in terms of politics, law, and transportation. We firmly believe that only by increasing production can we solve the price problem and promote the price control policy to achieve practical results.

At the same time, the following aspects of the price control strategy cannot be ignored: First, the conservation of consumption. Whether it is the government or the private sector, all organizations and even personal lives should regard saving capital, saving time, saving materials, and even saving manpower as the primary task during wartime. The policy of "streamlining troops" and "simplifying government" must be implemented at the top, and the extravagant habits of urban areas must be thoroughly eliminated at the bottom. Waste should be regarded as a crime, and extravagance should be regarded as an enemy. Then materials can be secured, and manpower can be concentrated. Second, facilitating transportation. The unification of transportation operations and the simplification of inspection agencies are the primary tasks for facilitating transportation. As for adjusting transportation organizations, improving transportation tools, utilizing existing private transportation equipment, repairing general roads, improving traffic management methods, facilitating the exchange of passengers and goods, and ensuring the convenience and safety of private material transportation, these are all what the authorities are currently urgently expected to do. Third, the government should make efforts to tighten currency and budget on the one hand, and adjust tax laws and control finance on the other. These four measures should be implemented simultaneously and complement each other, which is the main task of wartime economic policy, and also the only way to ensure the smooth completion of the price control strategy. If other solutions are sought instead of this, then no one can expect the full effect of any price control policy, even the increase in production. If the government has determination and courage, and the people can abide by the law and work hard, then not only the price problem, but also the realization of the entire wartime economic policy outline will not be a problem.

Finally, we can summarize the opinions and methods of the price control strategy and highlight its main points: that is, if we make our best efforts today to limit prices to a reasonable stability, then producers can increase production according to the outline and plan because the cost of production is relatively stable, without having to worry about some major losses in the future; consumers can have relative peace of mind psychologically and will not universally compete for goods and waste materials. Relatively scarce items will also not be completely controlled by a small number of people, and hoarders will reduce hoarding because there are no large profits to be made. Public and private transportation enterprises can develop in a situation where costs and expenses are relatively stable, and financial expenditures will not be expanded indefinitely due to soaring prices; the public can gradually restore and enhance their confidence in currency due to stable prices; and there will be significant assistance in the promotion of savings or government bond policies to be held in the future. On the other hand, actively increasing production, improving transportation to facilitate the flow of goods, and conserving consumption will lead to a balance between supply and demand in the market, and the price control policy will be easier to implement. At the same time, actively absorb large amounts of floating capital in society to reduce the major pressure of implementing price control policies; strengthen and tighten social organization, and improve institutions to assist in the promotion of price control policies. We especially hope that the relevant authorities will especially consider the hardships of the business community and the general public, and must take utmost efforts to reduce the suffering of the people as the main point. At the same time, we expect the business community to endure temporary inconveniences, that is, to sacrifice some profits, and cooperate with the government to implement policies to seek a reasonable solution together. We firmly believe that as long as the upper and lower levels empathize with the difficulties of the times and cooperate in implementation, the future success is undoubtedly assured.

### On Preparations for Non-Retreat and Decisive Battle

The German authorities announced that German forces retreated from Rostov and Voroshilovgrad on the night of the 14th. Rostov is a must-contend place for controlling the Don River area, the Caucasus, and the Volga area, and Voroshilov is also an important strategic location in the eastern part of the Donets. However, in the current German-Soviet war situation, what should be emphasized is not the fight for one city or one place, but the overall situation of the decisive battle posture in the future.

There are many reasons why the Red Army was able to take a positive offensive in this winter war. The most important reason is that in the German army's summer offensive last year, the Red Army adopted a retreat strategy. As a result, the German army lost the opportunity to encircle and annihilate the Red Army. Therefore, in this winter war, the Red Army's strength is much better than in the previous winter war.

From the current situation, we can know that the German army believes that instead of adhering to the gains and losses of one city or one place, it is more appropriate to look at the overall situation of the German-Soviet decisive battle and come up with the most advantageous strategy.

The scale of the European war is expanding day by day, so how the total war progresses in the future is more worthy of attention than the advance and retreat of local fronts. Germany is now determined to use the total strength of the country to launch another offensive against the Soviet Union, and it is said that it has great confidence in the preparation of food, military supplies, human resources, and domestic rectification, which is in line with the expectations of the Axis powers.

Moreover, from the above point of view, in this winter war, the German army's consumption will be limited to the minimum. Here, we cannot but pay serious attention to it. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on February 16)

### French Government Announces Decision to Return Concessions in China and Renounce Extraterritorial Rights Implementation Upon Resolution of Relevant Issues

Vichy, 23rd (Havas) - An official announcement this morning stated that, in order to strengthen friendly relations between China and France, France has decided to renounce its judicial privileges in China and its administrative rights in the Legation Quarter in Beijing, the Shanghai International Settlement, Kulangsu, and the French Concessions in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. The French government will immediately announce the implementation of this decision once all the issues involved have been resolved.

Vichy, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The French Information Department today issued the following statement regarding France's revocation of extraterritorial rights and return of concessions in China: The French government, in order to enhance friendly relations between China and France, has decided to abolish its judicial privileges in China and return the administrative rights of the Legation Quarter in Beijing, the International Settlement in Shanghai and Kulangsu, and the French Concessions in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. However, in view of the various difficult issues that will arise simultaneously when giving up these rights, the government will quickly implement the decision announced this time as soon as all issues have been resolved and within the scope of possibility.

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Propaganda Department issued a statement at 6:00 PM on the 23rd, quoting the original text of the Vichy dispatch as follows: "The French government's statement on the revocation of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions in China: In order to strengthen friendly relations between China and France, France has decided to revoke extraterritorial rights in China and renounce the administrative rights of the Legation Quarter in Dongjiaominxiang, Beijing, the Shanghai International Settlement, the Kulangsu International Settlement in Fuzhou, and the concessions in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. The French government is prepared to implement and announce this decision at the earliest possible time after the relevant issues have been resolved."

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - After receiving instructions from his government, French Consul in Nanjing, Celat, visited Zhang, the Minister of European and American Affairs, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:00 AM on the 23rd, and delivered the French government's statement on the revocation of extraterritorial rights and concessions in China.

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - On January 9, the day China entered the war, the Japanese government concluded an agreement with the National Government to return concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. Both sides established a processing committee to discuss the details of implementation, and the various matters of return and abolition are proceeding rapidly. After the Sino-Japanese agreement was concluded, the Italian government immediately announced the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions in China. This time, France, understanding the National Government's position and the situation in East Asia, resolutely returned the administrative rights of the concessions and international settlements in China to the National Government, and abolished judicial privileges in China. The National Government expressed deep gratitude to the French government for its friendly measures, and also expressed gratitude to the Japanese government for its mediation between China and France. At this point, China's century-long hope of recovering the concessions has in fact been fully achieved. It has been less than three years since the National Government returned to the capital, but its diplomatic policy has been successful, and China's international status has also been elevated. At the same time, it has had a great impact on Chongqing.

Foreign Minister Chu's Statement

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Regarding France's statement on returning concessions in China and abolishing extraterritorial rights, Foreign Minister Chu specifically issued the following statement: "Since our government declared war on Britain and the United States on January 8 this year from a position of independence and autonomy, it has gained the sympathy and assistance of friendly countries. Therefore, one hour after the declaration of war, our friendly nation, Japan, signed a joint declaration with our country to jointly complete the war, and also signed an agreement to return concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. The Italian government also issued a declaration on January 14 to return concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. This kind of genuine and friendly proof is truly epoch-making and historical, and makes our government and people very excited and grateful. Sino-French relations have always been cordial. I have stayed in France for a long time and have great sympathy for France. I am also very concerned about and understand the difficulties France has encountered in recent years. The current situation of France is caused by the deception and destruction of Britain and the United States. It is well known to the world that China's concessions and extraterritorial rights originated from British and American imperialism. Now that all countries have declared the return of concessions in China and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, it is unbearable for the Chinese people to see France alone retain this kind of remnant of British and American imperialism. It also affects France's national honor and prestige. Fortunately, the wise authorities in France, with foresight, have resolutely and automatically formally declared the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. From now on, the world in East Asia will be clear and bright, and the relationship between China and France will definitely be more friendly. I am deeply gratified and hope that other countries will follow suit."

Japanese Minister Good Fortune's Remarks

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Japanese Embassy Information Minister Good Fortune issued a statement at 7:00 PM on the 23rd, "Today, the 23rd, the French ambassador visited the Minister of European and American Affairs of the National Government and announced that France is willing to voluntarily give up all its privileges in China. This is truly an epoch-making fact in the history of Chinese diplomacy and can be said to be a great success of the National Government's diplomacy. Japan takes mutual cooperation and the liberation of Asia as its fundamental diplomatic policy to cooperate in building a new China. Based on this policy, it took the lead among all countries on January 9 this year to abolish extraterritorial rights and return exclusive concessions. Following this, its ally, Italy, also took the same measures as Japan. This time, France will also return all its privileges in China to China, which is truly gratifying. In the past, when Britain and the United States saw that Japan had abolished extraterritorial rights and returned concessions in China, they were greatly embarrassed and made the same statement to Chongqing three days later as Japan. However, France's measures this time are completely different in nature from those of Britain and the United States, because Britain and the United States only shamelessly returned what had already been occupied by Japan, which is empty talk and of no practical use. On the contrary, France is truly giving up its own privileges. France is a country with important interests in Japan's presence in China, and its exclusive concessions are located in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and other places. This time, in order to take a common step in its policy towards Japan, it is cooperating to restore China's complete sovereignty, which is a great contribution to the national independence and liberation of both China and Japan. We express our full respect for this."

### Results of Japanese Air Force in New Hebrides Islands One Enemy Destroyer Sunk

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 5:00 PM on the 23rd that the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force bombed Espiritu Santo Island in the New Hebrides Islands on the night of February 21, fiercely bombing enemy ships at anchor and various military facilities. One enemy destroyer was bombed and sunk, another was hit and caught fire, and the facilities on the island were severely damaged. We suffered no damage.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Since this year, the Japanese Navy has been operating in the South Pacific, constantly inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. It has also bombed the New Hebrides Islands. The island is located 600 nautical miles south of the Solomon Islands and is within the enemy's air force range. The Japanese elite air force first attacked Espiritu Santo Island, an important point on the island, on January 20, fiercely bombing the airfield, causing fires in four places. On the 22nd, it bombed the airfield again, causing fires in six places. On the 26th, it made a third fierce bombing, causing fires in three places at the airfield. On February 21, it made a fourth fierce attack on the island. Japanese planes braved fierce defensive artillery fire and fiercely bombed enemy ships at anchor. One enemy destroyer was hit and sunk, another caught fire, and the enemy's land military facilities were severely damaged. The Japanese planes launched four air raids on the island, all at night. Although the enemy's defensive artillery fire was very fierce, the Japanese planes suffered no losses in all four raids and returned safely to their original defenses. Moreover, when Espiritu Santo Island was first fiercely attacked on January 20, US Navy Secretary Knox happened to be staying on the island to inspect the South Pacific front. At that time, he fled in a panic and narrowly escaped. The Japanese Navy Air Force has been active in the South Pacific, inflicting great material and psychological damage on the United States and Australia. The New Hebrides Islands, which were fiercely bombed by Japanese planes this time, are a major link between the United States and Australia and a major supply base. The Japanese planes fiercely attacked the island to cut off the sea supply line of the enemy forces on Guadalcanal Island, putting them in a major crisis. The approximately 30,000 remaining US troops under Bachi on Guadalcanal Island are now on the verge of collapse.

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Melbourne, the Allied Commander in the Southwest Pacific announced on the 22nd that the Japanese Air Force had bombed Milne Bay and Buna on the 21st.

Buenos Aires, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington, the US Navy Department announced on the 22nd that a fighter plane had not yet returned after a US Navy Air Force attempted to bomb New Georgia Island on the 21st.

### German Forces Advance on Three Routes: Tebessa Threatened; British Eighth Army Moves Toward Mareth Line

Rome, February 23rd, Huitong News Agency: Today's Italian military communique states that over the past four days, Axis forces in Tunisia captured 845 enemy soldiers, seized or destroyed 66 tanks, 74 armored vehicles, 58 artillery pieces, and countless other war materials. Yesterday, five enemy aircraft were shot down over the Strait of Sicily and Tunisia. Near Milos Island, enemy aircraft attacked our convoy, with two fighters and two torpedo planes shot down. Palermo and its suburbs were bombed last night, resulting in 6 civilian deaths and 6 injuries. Two enemy aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire, and one was shot down by our night fighters. Additionally, two enemy aircraft were shot down over Pantelleria Island, and one enemy aircraft was shot down over Catanzaro.

Tangier, February 23rd, Huitong News Agency: General Eisenhower's headquarters issued a statement saying that German forces are advancing on three routes. One route is advancing north through the Kasserine Pass, reaching a point six kilometers south of Thala, which is the gateway to the plains behind the British First Army's line of defense, approximately eight kilometers from the crucial railway connecting Tebessa and northern Tunisia. Rommel is advancing with elite troops. The British tanks, artillery, and infantry retreating from the Kasserine Pass have suffered considerable losses. The Axis forces advancing west toward Tebessa are crossing the Algerian border.

Stockholm, Sweden, February 23rd, Huitong News Agency: The Gothenburg Commercial Shipping News reports that British military experts are deeply concerned about developments in Tunisia. It is reported that the German offensive is aimed at Tebessa, which has been threatened by recent German victories. If Tebessa falls into German hands, cooperation between the British First and Eighth Armies will be in danger of being cut off. In that case, even if the British Eighth Army's offensive on the Mareth Line succeeds, it will be futile. This German victory will have a significant impact on other battlefields and future wars, as the Allies repeatedly suffer setbacks, delaying the invasion of Europe, and the Soviet Union's offensive power may gradually diminish during this period.

Stockholm, Sweden, February 23rd, Huitong News Agency: According to the latest news from the front in London, the Kasserine Pass, the gateway to the Allied base in Thala, has been occupied by Axis forces. German infantry and tank units are currently engaged in fierce battles with British and American tank units in central Tunisia. The Kasserine Pass is located northwest of the town of Kasserine, approximately thirteen kilometers away. Since the town was occupied by Axis forces last week, Allied forces have retreated to new positions. The German forces took advantage of their victory to advance into this narrow pass, only four kilometers wide and about ten kilometers deep, with two roads and one railway running through it. The Axis forces now control two railways in central and southern Tunisia, and a third railway is also threatened by the Axis advance. It is reported that the British Eighth Army is moving towards the Mareth Line front, approximately thirty-five kilometers from the main Axis position.

Battle for the Atlas Mountains Imminent

Berlin, February 23rd, Huitong News Agency: Authoritative sources here declare that after the successful localized operations of German tank units in central Tunisia, they have taken advantage of their victory to advance and have now defeated the American forces operating there. The battle for the Atlas Mountains is about to begin. Yesterday, American forces had another 40 tanks destroyed by our forces.

Bern, Switzerland, February 22nd, Havas News Agency: According to the latest news from Rome and Berlin, Axis forces in Tunisia are advancing steadily. British and American sources acknowledge that American forces are continuing to retreat in southern Tunisia. Today, the main Axis forces advanced in central Tunisia. According to Italian military reports, they have occupied several British and American positions. Every transportation line and troop concentration point has been repeatedly attacked by the Axis air force. Berlin announced that a large number of British troops, including tanks, had been annihilated north of Tebessa. This news has been confirmed by the North African Allied Forces Command's communiqué. It is reported that British forces have committed their armored divisions to attacking "danger points," where German forces are fiercely attacking positions 40 miles from the Allied base at Tebessa. After occupying the Kasserine Pass, the German advance continued. A column of General Montgomery's British Eighth Army continues to advance from Médenine towards the strong Axis defenses of the Mareth Line. Heavy rains are falling in central Tunisia. According to Allied sources, the main armored forces, artillery, and infantry of both the Axis and British/American forces are concentrated near the northern Tunisian coast. A major battle is more likely to occur in this area than in the south. The Moroccan wireless station announced that Axis forces are attacking fiercely northwest of Kasserine, south of Sbiba, and behind Metdjéz el Bab. Allied forces are currently making every effort to block them.

### Kouang-Tchéou-Wan: Public Security Restored in the City; Residents Cooperate, Creating a New Atmosphere

Kouang-Tchéou-Wan, Xiying, February 23rd, Central News Agency: During the Japanese army's entry into the French concession in Kouang-Tchéou-Wan, they had obtained the full understanding of the French beforehand. The Chongqing side did not anticipate that the Japanese army would land there, so they did not build adequate military facilities in the area. However, this place was a crucial point on the Chongqing side's last remaining smuggling route, so the blow it suffered was profound, and its embarrassing situation was difficult to conceal. The various situations seen here differ from those seen during previous battles. For example, residents near the Kouang-Tchéou-Wan concession would temporarily enter the French concession in Xiying to take refuge upon hearing gunfire from the Xuwen direction. The military and political organs belonging to the Chongqing side had already fled without a trace. After the Japanese army entered, public security was restored, and the general refugees, following the Japanese side's advice, returned one after another. It is learned that the Chongqing side's various organs escaped into the interior on the night of the 17th. The Chongqing side's newspapers in Chikan, such as the Daguang Bao and Liyan Bao, had already moved to the Yulin area beforehand. Both newspapers have ceased publication since the 17th. Currently, no Chongqing side newspapers can be seen in the entire Kouang-Tchéou-Wan area. Furthermore, Commandant Trémoulet seemed to have sensed the Japanese army's intention to enter beforehand, so he issued a special notice advising the people not to act rashly and to be cautious in their actions. The leaflets issued by the Japanese army upon entering have now achieved results, so the residents are adopting a cooperative attitude. Also, when news of the Japanese army's commencement of operations was heard, food prices soared, but after the situation calmed down shortly after the Japanese army entered, they began to decline. The general overseas Chinese are fully cooperating with the Japanese side, so the Kouang-Tchéou-Wan area is now full of a new atmosphere.

Guangzhou, February 22nd, Central News Agency: Kouang-Tchéou-Wan used to be a stronghold for Chongqing's special operations. This time, due to the entry of the Japanese army, its gloom has been swept away, and it has returned to its original state. Looking back at the Chongqing side's use of Kouang-Tchéou-Wan as a base for plotting, the facts are as follows: After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the impending fall of Hong Kong, the Chongqing side selected Kouang-Tchéou-Wan as a base for so-called special operations, dispatching a large number of personnel to infiltrate the area and engage in clandestine activities. The area then resembled pre-war Hong Kong. The Chongqing side also mobilized various conspiracy organizations, such as the CC Clique, to expand its sabotage work, focusing on the following points: (1) Disrupting public security in the Japanese-occupied areas; (2) Enticing promising overseas Chinese; (3) Monitoring anti-Chongqing personnel, etc., engaging in covert activities. Furthermore, due to the increasing military importance of Guilin, the forward base of the US Air Force in Chongqing, the Chongqing side's intelligence-gathering activities based in Kouang-Tchéou-Wan also became increasingly active. It is learned that recently, CC Clique leaders Dai Li and Chen Su have arrived in Guilin to manipulate the special operations in Kouang-Tchéou-Wan, and a plan to establish air bases in Kouang-Tchéou-Wan and various parts of the Leizhou Peninsula is also being carried out in secret. Last July, the 7th War Zone's Leizhou Border Area Defense Command was established to strengthen defenses in that area, intending to actively start activities towards Hainan Island. However, due to this preemptive entry by the Japanese army, the Chongqing side's special operations have now been completely crushed.

Japanese Aircraft Assist in Landing Operations

Japanese Army Base in South China, February 23rd, Central News Agency: In order to assist the Japanese army in launching landing operations on the Leizhou Peninsula, the Japanese naval air force has been searching for Chongqing's military strongholds in that area and Chongqing's ships sailing at sea over the past few days, thoroughly bombing them and achieving great results. On one day, a naval bomber squadron suddenly attacked Meilu in Wuchuan on the north bank of Kouang-Tchéou-Wan, fiercely bombing the Chongqing army that was plotting to act, and nearby military facilities were also destroyed. The next day, it drove a long distance to attack the Jiuzhou River estuary on the western shore of the Leizhou Peninsula, fiercely bombing the military facilities there and crushing the Chongqing shipping fleet stationed there. Afterwards, on a certain day, it searched for the Chongqing army in the Wuchuan area and discovered several motorized sailboats fully loaded with soldiers four kilometers north of the area on the sea. It immediately dive-bombed them. Another unit sank all of the Chongqing army's hundred-ton motorized vessels and sailing fleets, etc., on the southwest sea of the Leizhou Peninsula. On a certain day, it also bombed the Chongqing military facilities in the Beihai area (northwest of the Leizhou Peninsula, along the Tokyo Bay coast), scoring another victory. During the Japanese air force's repeated sorties, no counterattacks were seen from the Chongqing army.

Course of the Japanese Entry into Kouang-Tchéou-Wan

Tokyo News Agency, 3rd, Central News Agency: According to a telegram from a naval reporting team member on a certain Japanese warship, a Japanese warship first anchored off Xiying in Kouang-Tchéou-Wan at 2:10 AM on a certain morning. At 2:30 PM, the Kouang-Tchéou-Wan Commandant Trémoulet visited the Japanese army commander on the warship. The Japanese army commander landed at 4:00 PM to return the visit at Commandant Trémoulet's residence. From 11:00 AM on the 20th, the Japanese plenipotentiary began to negotiate the Japanese army's entry into Kouang-Tchéou-Wan with Commandant Trémoulet at his residence. At 12:10 PM, a complete agreement was reached and took effect immediately. Thereupon, the commander of the Japanese army corps advancing on the Leizhou Peninsula arrived at Xiying at 5:00 PM that afternoon. At 5:10 PM, he boarded the warship to visit the Japanese naval commander, shook hands, and spoke happily. At 3:00 PM on the 21st, the Japanese marines, in accordance with the spirit of the Japanese-Vietnamese joint defense agreement, landed at the Xiying wharf to garrison Kouang-Tchéou-Wan in order to defend Kouang-Tchéou-Wan. The French and Annamese soldiers were lined up in the square in front of the wharf to welcome the Japanese army. The people witnessed the scene of the Japanese and Vietnamese armies rejoicing together, and all were deeply pleased. The Japanese marines held a parade in the city of Xiying, and residents along the way hung Japanese flags to show their welcome.

### Spokesperson of the Japanese Expeditionary Force to China Issues Statement

Nanjing, February 23rd, Central News Agency: The spokesperson of the Japanese Expeditionary Force to China issued a statement on the 23rd, stating that since the beginning of this year, the Japanese Expeditionary Force to China has overcome severe cold and continued to carry out operations in various parts of North and Central China. In particular, since mid-February, the Japanese army in Central China has begun spring offensive operations in two directions and is currently making active progress. One of these two operations is the operation to eliminate the Chongqing army's Lu-Su War Zone in northern Jiangsu, and the other is the operation to eliminate the Chongqing 6th and 2nd War Zones in the areas surrounding Wuhan. The results of these operations are gradually expanding. At the same time, elite Japanese troops, with the close assistance of the naval forces, are carrying out landing operations on the Leizhou Peninsula in South China and have further entered the areas surrounding Kouang-Tchéou-Wan in the French concession. This time, when the Japanese army entered, the Chongqing army imitated the old tricks of the British and Americans and attempted to infringe upon French rights and interests. Now, the Chongqing army near Guangzhou is moving south, attempting to act rashly. The Japanese and Vietnamese sides, based on the principle of Japanese-Vietnamese garrison, with complete agreement on both sides, are carrying out preemptive strikes. Its significance in terms of operations and economy is extremely significant. These operations can be said to be divine punishment for the Chongqing side, which is willing to be a traitor to East Asia. Looking back, since the National Government participated in the war, the Chinese army has assisted the Japanese army in fighting side by side, launching fierce attacks on the Chongqing bandits who are traitors to the construction of a new China. Recently, the Chongqing army's will to fight is clearly low. This can be clearly seen from the recent operations in various places. In various battlefields, the number of Chongqing army prisoners and surrendering soldiers is increasing day by day, showing the progress of the Greater East Asia War. Under this situation, the Chongqing side has great expectations for the activities of the US Air Force in Chongqing, and seems to be attempting to counterattack with air guerrilla warfare. The Japanese air force in China is determined to destroy them, so currently all enemy aircraft are lurking. The Japanese Expeditionary Force to China, with the strengthening and expansion of the National Government's political power, is increasingly exerting the original features of its operations and is determined to eliminate the British and American air forces and promote the collapse of the Chongqing side.

### Results of the Battle for Bailizhou: Japanese Army's Results

Nanjing, February 23rd, Central News Agency: According to a telegram from a certain Japanese army base on the 23rd, after a certain unit of the Japanese army occupied Bailizhou, downstream of Yichang, on the 17th of this month, it formed a favorable posture against the Chongqing army in the 6th War Zone. Chen Cheng, the commander of that war zone, in order to regain the strategically important Bailizhou, attacked that place with 500 men from the 16th Division on the morning of the 19th. After the Japanese army's counterattack, all were annihilated. In another direction, a separate detachment of the Japanese army that landed on the island is currently preparing to attack a certain unit of the Chongqing army. Up to the present time, the Japanese army's overall results are: 1,160 Chongqing army soldiers killed, 200 captured. The Japanese army seized 18 light machine guns, 300 rifles, 688 landmines, 150 hand grenades, and 500 boats.

### Britain and the United States Compete for Air Supremacy

(Special Telegram from Kato, Berlin, 15th) According to the latest information obtained in Berlin, the conflict between Britain and the United States regarding control of air routes is gradually becoming public. The United States' ambition to overthrow Britain from the world stage, and Britain's desperate struggle in decline, can be seen in this.

A few days ago, in the British House of Lords, former Air Minister Lord Londonderry questioned the government authorities, saying:

"The rise and fall of a nation's power depends on its citizens establishing civil aviation routes widely around the world. Regarding this issue, cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union is needed. The United States has secured 25 percent of the world's aviation rights. What countermeasures does the government have against this established fact?"

In response, Under-Secretary of State for Air Balfour represented the government and replied:

"The government is currently studying this issue and hopes to reach an agreement with the United States if necessary. Unfortunately, Britain is currently exerting all its efforts to engage in war, so there is neither time nor resources to open up civil aviation routes."

The United States' attempt to produce aircraft is not focused on war purposes but is intended to defeat all commercial enemies in order to monopolize world post-war trade, and therefore contains self-interested elements. The above answer reveals dissatisfaction with the United States.

The discussion of the "World Aviation Routes" issue has been raging between Britain and the United States for several weeks. From all aspects, the United States is plotting a monopoly. As Vice President Wallace said: "The construction of global aviation routes is of paramount importance, and only this can ensure world peace." The United States believes that airplanes that can connect continents with continents in a few hours must be built, and claims that "the freedom of the air" in the future has the same meaning as "the freedom of the seas" in the past. The United States has secured Iceland and a large part of the British tea plantation in the Caribbean Sea, and has also occupied Germany's former air routes in South America. The United States is expanding to North Africa and Cyrenaica from these bases. Therefore, as The Times argues, it is only natural that Britain is suffering because these bases give the United States absolute rights to use post-war aviation routes. In fact, British newspapers are filled with news that because the United States' desire to occupy military bases is insatiable, Britain will completely lose its own aviation routes, clearly indicating the threat from the United States.

Regarding the above-mentioned discussions in the British House of Lords, news commentators unanimously expressed dissatisfaction with the government's statement. The Daily Mail pointed out the tremendous power of the United States' transport aircraft production and said, "The government's attitude is ambiguous." The Daily Telegraph argued that "the United States has a monopoly on the production of military and civil transport aircraft. The government should immediately negotiate with the United States on this issue."

In other words, the United States is solely responsible for the production of transport aircraft and bombers that can be used on air routes, while Britain is producing fighters that are of no use on air routes.

### Overview of French Concessions in China

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – As France simultaneously recognized the National Government and announced the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China, as well as the return of concessions in various locations, a brief account of the situation of French concessions in China is provided below. (Shanghai) According to the Sino-French agreement of April 2, 1849, the area south of the British concession and north of Shanghai city, along the Huangpu River, was designated as the French concession. The initially designated concession area was only 944 mu. Subsequently, on October 29, 1861, it was expanded to the Huangpu River area of Shanghai city, increasing the area to 1,122 mu. On January 27, 1900, it was further expanded westward by 912 mu. At the same time, the 114 mu under French de facto control before 1849 was also formally recognized. Later, on July 20, 1914, it was further expanded westward by 13,002 mu. As of today, the total area of the French concession in Shanghai is 15,150 mu. (Tianjin) The Tianjin concession was established in 1861 and expanded in 1900. It bordered the British concession to the southeast, extended to the Weishi Canal in the west, adjoined the Japanese concession to the northwest, and reached the Baihe River estuary to the northeast, with a total area of 2,360 mu. (Guangzhou Shamian) Shamian, the foreign residential area of Guangzhou, faces the Pearl River in the southwestern corner of Guangzhou. It was originally a sandbar, which was filled in over three years starting in 1839 to form a small oval island. The French concession occupied eleven acres in the eastern part of the island, accounting for one-fifth of the entire island's area. (Hankou) Established in June 1896 and expanded to its current size in 1902. The concession faces the Yangtze River, opposite the former German concession, south of the Japanese concession, and north of the former Russian concession, covering an area of approximately 492.82 acres.

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Regarding the period, area, and administrative organization of French concessions in various parts of China, details are as follows: Tianjin concession period: 1806, area approximately 2,300 mu, administrative organization: French Concession Council, with ten members elected in 1934, including seven French and three Chinese. Hankou concession period: 1858, opened in 1896, developed in 1900, expanded area 360 mu, administrative organization: Municipal Council. Guangzhou Shamian concession period: opened in 1861, area 54 mu, administrative organization: Council, with seven council members. Shanghai concession period: 1844, opened in 1899, expanded area 14,900 mu in 1914, administrative organization: French Municipal Council. Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The establishment of extraterritorial rights by foreign countries within Chinese territory began with the Sino-British Five Ports Trade Regulations of 1843. France obtained this privilege based on the Huangpu Treaty of 1844. As of June 1939, fifteen countries enjoyed extraterritorial rights, including Japan, Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, Norway, Brazil, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Spain, Peru, Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland. Currently, Japan announced its abolition on January 9th of this year, and Italy declared the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights on January 14th of this year. Now, France has also announced its abolition, which has significant implications for the independence and integrity of our national sovereignty. Furthermore, the Shanghai French concession established the Mixed Court within its jurisdiction on April 20, 1829. In the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), China established the Second Special District Court and the High Branch Court in the French concession. After the National Government moved back to the capital, it officially took over the two courts on November 8, 1940, and has been in charge since then.

### Chongqing Military Mission Arrives in London

### Roosevelt Convenes Diplomatic Conference

Lisbon, 23rd (Havas) – Washington dispatch: President Roosevelt suddenly convened a diplomatic conference last night, attended by Secretary of State Hull, Undersecretary of State Welles, the President's Special Envoy to the Vatican, Mr. Taylor, Professor Bowman, an American territorial issues expert who participated in the Versailles Peace Conference, and Mr. Pasvolsky, Commissioner for Post-War Reconstruction. Washington officials revealed that the discussions at this meeting were related to general post-war issues.

Lisbon, 23rd (Havas) – Yesterday was Washington's Birthday. President Roosevelt gave a twelve-minute radio address to the nation, warning the people not to believe that victory was already in hand, as the Allied countries would face more misfortunes in the future.

### Commander of Italian Air Force in Eastern Europe Missing

Rome, 23rd (Havas) – Lieutenant General Betti, the commander of the Italian Air Force in Eastern Europe, ventured deep into enemy territory in an attempt to rescue Italian troops trapped in an encirclement. His fate remains unknown. A doctor who accompanied him on the plane is also missing. Betti had previously rescued Italian troops in distress on several occasions. In addition to transporting food and military supplies, he had also rescued wounded soldiers, and his achievements were remarkable. This time, the chances of survival are slim, and those who heard the news were deeply concerned.

### Turkey Schedules Presidential Election for March 8th; Current Prime Minister Still Expected to be Commissioned to Form Cabinet

Ankara, 23rd (Havas) – Turkey will hold a presidential election on March 8th, but it is only a formality. The newly formed Grand National Assembly of Turkey has already confirmed that President İsmet İnönü will be re-elected. According to the Turkish Constitution, the President's term of office is the same as the term of each new parliament. Therefore, a presidential election must be held when the new parliament is established. After the election, the cabinet must also resign as usual. However, it is widely believed that Saraçoğlu will still be commissioned to form a new cabinet and continue to serve as Foreign Minister. Political figures here expect that the Minister of Interior in the new cabinet will be appointed to Kırdağ, and the Minister of Economy will be taken over by Çayrum, the manager of the Sumer Bank. It is also learned that the new National Assembly will meet on March 15th to discuss the budget.

Ankara, 23rd (Havas) – Turkish newspapers commented yesterday that Turkish Prime Minister Saraçoğlu's radio address on Sunday reiterated Turkey's neutrality. In his speech, he indirectly denied rumors that Turkey would conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union. He stated that the existing old treaty between the Soviet Union and Turkey would continue to be effective in maintaining neighborly friendship.

### Sketch of Macau

(Special Correspondent Ishikawa in Macau, 14th) A port of opium adorned with cosmetics, perfume, and the voices of nightingales—Macau, known as the Monte Carlo of the East, is no longer a place for entertainment amidst the raging waves of the Greater East Asia War. Odd! Even!—The expressions of the Macanese people entrusting their fate to the dice, the hearts of the dancing girls embracing and dancing wildly to the jazz music of the end-of-century revelry, despite the darkness of the streets due to power conservation and the distress caused by soaring prices and insufficient supplies, they still reluctantly cling to the beautiful dreams of the past. This is the current expression of the Macanese people, presenting the diverse appearances of a neutral country.

The only neutral zone remaining in the Far East, bordering Zhongshan County, a region of peace, and separated from the Chongqing jurisdiction by only a narrow strip of water, linking Europe and the Far East, Macau, the Lisbon of the East, will have a multifaceted new character from an Eastern perspective.

Macau is located on a small, protruding island at the southern end of Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, forty li by water from Hong Kong and about eighty li from Guangzhou, with an area of only eleven square miles. In the 16th century, it was a trading base, always under the influence of Hong Kong. Therefore, the Macau government allowed the arrogance of anti-Japanese Chinese and tacitly approved the large-scale smuggling to the Chongqing area. However, in today's post-Greater East Asia War era, Britain's influence in East Asia has been completely expelled, and Japan's influence has swept across East Asia. Therefore, the attitude of the Macau government has naturally changed with the wind.

Economically, Macau has always been dependent on Hong Kong. It only prospered for a time due to the blockade of the Pearl River and re-export trade. Since the subordinate relationship with Hong Kong in economic terms was severed, trade with the mainland and Southeast Asia has also been cut off, leaving it completely isolated and unable to avoid dependence on Japan.

Today, there are also Japanese people and Japanese trading companies in Macau. Chinese merchants and hotel waiters all understand Japanese. In the dance halls attached to hotels, one can also hear "Kōjō no Tsuki" and other Japanese songs. In 1937, the Macau government's finances had an income of 4.78 million patacas and expenditures of 5 million patacas. Among the income, 2.7 million patacas, accounting for 56 percent, came from gambling and opium. Last year's income was only 4.25 million patacas, less than 670,000 patacas compared to previous years. In addition, prices have risen tenfold or twentyfold, so at least twice the budget is needed to cope. Therefore, the Macau government is in dire straits, with both ends not meeting.

Because of the cutoff of imports, the 140,000 to 150,000 tourists who came from Hong Kong and other places every year have also stopped coming. Therefore, Macau, once a place of joy, has now become a quiet city. Chongqing places emphasis on Macau for work related to overseas Chinese, with many Blue Shirts infiltrating, collecting intelligence, carrying out propaganda, and warning and threatening overseas Chinese to stay away from Japan. Merchants, in fact, have a difficult relationship that makes it necessary to cooperate with the Japanese side, but in these three years, five people have been assassinated for approaching the Japanese side. This is Chongqing's silent answer to the Chinese. Acts of violence are carried out openly in broad daylight, and not a single perpetrator has been arrested. In Macau, besides the Japanese consulate, there is also a British consulate, as well as honorary consulates of Thailand and the Netherlands. The British consulate has a large budget, gathering information after the loss of Hong Kong, carrying out anti-Axis incitement and propaganda, and secretly operating actively. Like Lisbon in Europe, it connects Britain and the United States with Chongqing, and is used as a base for espionage in place of Hong Kong. (Shō: From the February 16th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)

### 25th Anniversary of the Red Army's Founding; Stalin's Address to Soldiers; Acknowledges Imminent German Counteroffensive; Calls on the People to Mobilize All Forces

Ankara, 23rd (Havas) – Soviet Supreme Commander Stalin issued an address to soldiers on the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army, stating briefly: The Soviet Union is solely bearing the heavy responsibility of the war because the Second Front has not yet been opened. The purpose of establishing the Red Army is not to conquer other countries but to ensure peace and the Soviet Union's friendly relations with all countries. Although the Red Army was provoked in 1941, it was able to resist the attack without the help of a Second Front. The 25th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army coincides with a critical juncture in the war, which is particularly gratifying. The offensive in March has achieved the following results: The Soviet Army has captured Stalingrad, Voronezh, Tikhoretsk, Ingulets, North Ossetia, Kabardians, Ichkeria, Kalmykia, Stavropol, Krasnodar, Shershensky, Kashajev, Adygejsk, Rostov, Kharkov, and Kursk. Stalin warned the people and the army not to think that victory could be achieved in a short period. Although the German army is in trouble, it is not incapable of restoring its strength. It would be foolish to think that the German army would abandon a single meter of Soviet land without a fight. Stalin urged the people to mobilize all their forces and reiterated the Soviet Union's war aims, not only to recover Soviet territory but also to occupy Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Moldova. Considering that the German army will not only resist but also launch a counteroffensive, Stalin issued three orders: (1) Strictly train the Red Army; (2) Intensify the attack; (3) Intensify activities behind enemy lines. Stalin concluded the "Address to Soldiers" by cheering for the Bolshevik Party, which organized the Red Army and enabled it to win victories.

### Canadian Prime Minister Warns the Public Not to Be Prematurely Optimistic About the War Situation

Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Havas) – According to a dispatch from Ottawa, Canadian Prime Minister King delivered a speech in Ottawa yesterday, warning the people not to be falsely optimistic about the war situation. He stated that Canada's so-called severe trials in 1943 were unprecedented, as major events occurred one after another, and their speed has increased. In terms of armaments, the Allied and Axis powers are now on an equal footing.

### Eastern Front Main Battlefield Thaws; German Army Launches Fierce Counteroffensive; No Changes in the Situation West of Kharkov

Somewhere on the Soviet border, 23rd (Havas) – On the Eastern Front's main battlefield, the Soviet army's offensive has greatly slowed down due to heavy losses and the thawing of the land. The German counteroffensive intensified yesterday. However, the Red Army still maintains its offensive towards Dnepropetrovsk and Poltava. Moscow also admitted that German resistance has strengthened. The Red Army is now thirty-five miles away from Dnepropetrovsk. In addition, the Soviet Union is reported to have made some progress west of Rostov, Voroshilovgrad, and Krasnodar. However, the German counteroffensive south of Kramatorskaya is also very fierce. Even within the pocket in the Caucasus region, the German counteroffensive is becoming increasingly fierce. Recent Soviet communiqués only stated that they had captured several places in Ukraine and the Kuban River basin. As for other areas, it was said that they were continuing to advance in the original direction. According to Soviet newspaper reports, elite German troops have been sent to the west and southwest of Kharkov to curb the Red Army's offensive. The Red Army there intends to break through the German defense line between Poltava and the Dnieper River.

Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to news from the Eastern Front, the German army has launched a full-scale counteroffensive in the area between the Donets River and the bend of the Dnieper River since the afternoon of the 21st. Fierce fighting broke out at noon on the 22nd along the railway line connecting Pavlograd, Krasnograd, and Arumink. After the German army retreated from Lower Kharkov, the main force of the Soviet army moved rapidly in that direction, attempting to break through Dnepropetrovsk via Sinelnikovo, but was completely trapped in a dilemma due to the fierce German counteroffensive. According to a United Press dispatch from Moscow, it was admitted that the Soviet army had been forced to retreat from the north. There were no changes in the Kharkov area and other fronts. Overall, the decline in the Soviet army's combat power can no longer be concealed.

Berlin, 23rd (Havas) – According to observations by German reconnaissance units, after recapturing Kharkov, the Soviet army immediately transferred a considerable number of troops from that area to support the Donets Basin and the Dnieper River delta. Since February 8th, the Soviet army has attempted to advance from Izyum towards Mariupol on the coast of the Sea of Azov, while another part has pressed towards Zaporozhye in the southwest. However, this attempt, apart from some initial minor victories, has now completely failed. At the same time, the German counteroffensive launched from the west is becoming increasingly fierce. German armored vehicle formations successfully attacked the left flank of the Soviet army from the side on Sunday. Several Soviet units were surrounded, and more than half were annihilated. Two railway junctions that had been occupied by the Soviet army a few days ago have been recaptured by the German army. The terrain in the eastern part of the Donets industrial area is favorable for defense. The fighting in the Taganrog area is currently calm. The Soviet army has repeatedly carried out its encirclement maneuvers and has even broken through the German defense line, but has been driven back by the German counteroffensive. Frontal attacks by the enemy have yielded little success and have been paid for at a very heavy price. The situation northwest and west of Kharkov remains unchanged. The Soviet offensive in that area has weakened. The Soviet army is very active in the Oryol area, but the German counteroffensive is also increasing. On Sunday, the enemy no longer counterattacked between Lake Ilmen and Lake Ladoga. However, this current tranquility does not indicate that the Soviet army has abandoned its offensive to the north, as it is the calm before the storm.

German War Report

German Führer Headquarters, 23rd (Havas) – This afternoon's German war report stated that the Soviet army's attempt to achieve a major victory in southern Eastern Europe did not come to fruition. The enemy initially wanted to break through the German line of defense but failed. They then wanted to copy the German army's rear east of the Donets industrial area but were either annihilated or dispersed. The Soviet army, which attempted a large-scale encirclement south of Kharkov, was forced to retreat to the Dnieper. The German army cut off the enemy's communications and bombarded them from all sides. Many enemy troops were annihilated. German aircraft detected the location of enemy reinforcements and attacked them head-on. In view of the unpredictable weather, which is sometimes cold and sometimes warm, it is difficult for the Soviet army to launch large-scale military operations, so they are focusing on the area north of Kharkov, as well as the central and northern parts of Eastern Europe, hoping to gain something. Yesterday, the Soviet army repeatedly attacked the Kupiansk bridgehead, fought hard for a long time, and retreated with heavy losses. In the Donets area, several Soviet divisions again attempted to break through our positions but were still repelled. Between the Donets and the Dnieper, our tank and infantry units, with the help of aircraft, launched a fierce attack on the enemy army and annihilated the elite Soviet troops. There is still fierce fighting west of Kharkov and south of Oryol. The large-scale attacks by the Soviet air force, artillery, and tank units northeast and north of Oryol were all repelled. 55 Soviet tanks were destroyed. The Soviet army's attack on the bridgehead at Volkhov failed to return. South of Lake Ladoga, a large Soviet army attacked unsuccessfully and lost 47 tanks.

Berlin, 23rd (Havas) – Responsible officials stated that fierce fighting has resumed in the southern Eastern Front, especially in the Kupiansk, Novorossiysk, and Don River estuary areas. The attacking Soviet troops all suffered heavy blows and retreated. Between Kharkov and Oryol, the enemy's offensive failed, and 55 tanks were destroyed. The fighting in the Leningrad-Schlüsselburg area has also intensified at the same time. The enemy attacked fiercely under the cover of tanks and aircraft but made no progress. Fierce fighting is still ongoing.

Berlin, 23rd (Havas) – Military figures here stated that German aircraft heavily attacked the Soviet army between the Donets and the Dnieper and northwest of Kharkov yesterday, destroying 222 Soviet tanks, as well as more than 500 horse-drawn carriages and motorcycles. Many enemy cannons were silenced by low-flying German aircraft bombing. Our aircraft bombed the port area of Tuapse, and a large Soviet transport ship near the coast of the Caucasus was hit and damaged. Soviet ships concentrated near Novorossiysk were dispersed by German aircraft at night. On the northern Eastern Front, German aircraft heavily bombed railways and highways. The Soviet army's supplies and provisions encountered bombing. 39 Soviet aircraft were shot down yesterday, including six shot down by anti-aircraft guns.

### French Government Formally Announces the Abandonment of Extraterritorial Rights in China; French Concessions in Tianjin, Beijing, and This City are Included in the Return; Wartime Economic Policies are Expected to be Implemented Smoothly in the Future

Allied Press dispatch from this city: The French government has decided to abandon extraterritorial rights in China. This is a de facto recognition of the Nanjing government and lays the foundation for adjusting relations between the two countries. According to Allied Press reports, the return of the French concessions to the National Government is also a natural event. At that time, Japan will cooperate with the National Government to handle the return of the French concessions and will, at least for the time being, protect the returned concessions.

Furthermore, on Tuesday night, economic circles in this city pointed out that the French government's intention to return the Shanghai French Concession, that is, to return all administrative power to the National Government, will avoid various obstacles in effectively strengthening wartime economic policies in the future. Although the policies of the French Concession authorities in the past mostly imitated the Public Concession, there were still some differences, so the methods of economic management often could not proceed smoothly. This drawback can be avoided in the future.

### Vegetable Sources Increase; Vegetable Market Prices Drop Slightly; Authorities Repeatedly Confer on Measures to Suppress Prices; Decide to Strictly Prohibit Manipulation and Price Increases

Various vegetables and fresh goods that can be used as side dishes, such as fish, shrimp, and meat, have seen their selling prices increase daily due to the influence of sources and the manipulation and monopolization by market vendors. Although the authorities have repeatedly ordered and emphasized suppressing rising prices, these merchants often used excuses to pursue high profits. It is now learned that, as the Lunar New Year is about to pass, vegetable sources are increasing. At the same time, the purchasing power of citizens is weakening. Under these circumstances of oversupply, market prices have inevitably declined slightly. Therefore, in recent days, the selling prices of vegetables and fresh goods have been lower than before.

Increased Sources; Selling Prices Can Fall

According to a person familiar with the vegetable market situation who spoke to reporters, due to the even distribution of rain last winter, the growth of various vegetable seedlings in the suburban farms was quite rapid, and the harvesting period has now arrived. In addition, because the vegetable market prices in this city have doubled compared to last year, general vegetable vendors are rushing to transport vegetables because they can make high profits. For this reason, the source of vegetables has greatly increased. Therefore, the selling price of vegetables in this city is expected to decline again. However, the authorities have always strictly controlled the selling prices of various goods and will resolutely adhere to their original intentions regarding the prices of vegetables related to the daily lives of general citizens, making every effort to curb vendors from raising prices to seek profits, and also helping to dredge sources.

Authorities Send Personnel to Inspect Weights and Measures

The English-language "Times" reported that after the authorities of the two concessions sent inspectors to implement price suppression and inspect weights and measures in various vegetable markets, the prices of most foods, especially fresh meat and vegetables, had slightly decreased yesterday. According to the report, the creation of these new high prices was due to speculative activities that prevailed at the beginning of this month.

Strict Rules Expected to be Announced

According to the expectations of general residents, the authorities will take unprecedentedly severe actions after conducting the investigation, and the results will certainly be able to further reduce prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. Furthermore, according to many observers, once the new steps to crack down on illegal vendors are implemented, there is no doubt that the prices of most goods will fall back to below the price levels before the Lunar New Year. Regarding the increase in prices, it is widely believed that the authorities are prepared to respond with effective methods again and may organize a strict system to control prices and announce strict rules for controlling prices.

Repeated Consultations to Discuss Responses

At the same time, according to inquiries made by reporters, the authorities have already recognized that the recent resurgence of rising prices of goods (including vegetable market prices) in the concessions over the past month is extremely noteworthy. Relevant parties have repeatedly conferred in the past week to discuss more effective ways to respond. Before these methods are fully completed, the authorities will implement emergency measures to try to bring prices back down.

### Japanese Military Spokesman Releases Statement

According to a dispatch from the Domei News Agency in this city, a Japanese military spokesman announced at a meeting of foreign reporters on Tuesday that, following the National Government's entry into the war, the Japanese army launched its first offensive in Central China, in Hankou and on the north bank of the Yangtze River. They have fully assessed the fighting ability and morale of the Chongqing forces, finding them to be quite demoralized. The purpose of this move by the Japanese army is to hinder Chongqing from reinforcing Yunnan. This type of rear attack is intended to make Chongqing officials feel anxious. The spokesman also pointed out that one of the most important characteristics of this Japanese military action is the actual support provided to the Japanese army by the Nanjing troops. He predicted that the military strength of Nanjing will inevitably gradually increase until it can maintain the security and order of the occupied territories. Currently, this task is being undertaken by the Japanese army. Chongqing claims that the Japanese army's actions in Central China are only to prevent Chongqing forces from being transferred to southern Yunnan, but in fact, Japan can take the opportunity to invade the interior.

### Press Corps from This City Inspects Cleared Areas, Warmly Welcomed by Officials and Civilians Along the Way

### Eliminating Black Market for Gold Bars and Jewelry Expected Within the Week, Relaxation of Price Controls to be Resolved Simultaneously

According to a report received yesterday afternoon by a Datong News Agency reporter from relevant sources, the stalemate regarding the suspension of gold jewelry exchange by silver shops is expected to be resolved satisfactorily within the week. Since the Price Control Department of the Public Works Department repeatedly met with representatives of silver shops, listened to detailed complaints about the difficulties currently faced by the industry, they have begun to closely monitor the behind-the-scenes activities that are fueling the gold market price surge. They are currently carefully studying appropriate measures to eliminate the gold industry's black market and plan to implement them within a week at the latest. At that time, the issue of relaxing price controls on jewelry, as requested by silver shops, can be resolved accordingly. According to news from the silver shop industry, the Price Control Department authorities will make appropriate arrangements for the issue of relaxing price controls on jewelry in the near future. According to observations from within the industry, the possible solution to this problem is the strict restriction of the gold market's after-hours trading, because relaxing price controls on jewelry is only a temporary solution. If the gold market's after-hours trading is not eradicated, the threat of soaring gold prices currently faced by silver shops is likely to reappear. Therefore, in order to stabilize jewelry market prices, it is hoped that the authorities will promptly adopt the aforementioned wise measures.

These have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. It is understood that the Municipal Finance Bureau has decided to start collecting them from February of the 32nd year [1943], instructing the Shanghai West Office to comply with the regulations and issuing Public Notice No. 33 of the Cai character yesterday (23rd) for general knowledge.

### Elementary Schools in Various Districts of This City to Raise Teacher Salaries, Education Bureau Issues Order to Comply

The Education Bureau of this city, in view of the very meager salaries of elementary school teachers in various districts under its jurisdiction and the inability to secure their livelihoods, which is insufficient to dedicate themselves to their duties and value education, yesterday issued orders to the various district offices under its jurisdiction to increase salaries in accordance with actual circumstances. All district-established elementary schools should pay salaries in accordance with the city school teacher salary standards starting this month.

### 400 Houses in Zhabei to be Transferred to City Government This Morning, Rent of 3 Million Yuan to be Returned Simultaneously, Protocol to be Signed by Chinese and Japanese Officials

Four hundred houses and other assets in the Zhabei district, because their original owners left at the beginning of the war, were managed by the Japanese military authorities. Now that the situation has become much more stable and international relations are becoming closer, the above-mentioned properties will be released from military management today and formally transferred to the management of the municipal government by the Japanese authorities. In addition, there is also one-third of the rent paid by tenants under the management of the Japanese authorities, totaling 500,000 Japanese yen, equivalent to over 2.5 million storage certificates, which will also be transferred to the Chinese side at the same time. It is believed that houses and other buildings in the concession that are in similar situations will also be gradually transferred to the Chinese side in the future. This transfer will not affect the tenants in the houses, as the rent will still be collected by the Japanese Residents Association on behalf of the Chinese authorities at the original rates. The protocol for today's transfer of houses is scheduled to be signed at 10:00 AM this morning in the conference room of the Japanese Naval Garrison Office. The Japanese side will be signed by the naval garrison official, and the Chinese side will be signed by Mayor Chen.

### Fashion Industry Implements Price Controls for Sales

The Public Works Department's Materials Control Department has imposed price controls on all kinds of goods to strictly prevent unscrupulous merchants from monopolizing, hoarding, and raising prices for sale. Therefore, it has ordered the guilds of various industries to investigate and submit the cost of goods to the department for review. The fashion industry in this city has already complied with the authorities' price control measures, notifying all member fashion companies to implement price controls for sales, selling goods at the actual marked price, without discounts, in order to standardize and facilitate transactions. These measures have been implemented since yesterday. If any fashion company dares to violate the rules and exceed the price limits, it will be reported to the authorities for severe punishment.

### YMCA Restaurant Lawsuit Procedure Does Not Comply with Legal Requirements

The Sichuan Road YMCA previously rented surplus rooms facing the road to Lin Chunling to open the Zai Nian Hui Western Restaurant for more than 20 years. The relationship between the two parties has always been harmonious. In the meantime, due to modifications to the rent and conditions, although the contract has been changed several times, the main principles have never changed. Recently, the YMCA, represented by Ling Xitao, filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court against Lin, seeking to recover the property for its own use, claiming that the room was contracted in nature and there was no lease relationship. The case was heard in court yesterday by Judge Mo. The plaintiff first stated the above. The defendant's lawyer, Wu Linkun, responded, stating that the YMCA is a corporate body, and the current plaintiff is only an employee of the YMCA and has no right to sue on behalf of the law. Moreover, it is still unknown whether this case is the original intention of the YMCA authorities. Therefore, the litigation procedure in this case is not in compliance with the law and the original complaint should be dismissed. After reviewing the circumstances in court, it was found that the litigation procedure in this case was indeed not in compliance with the law and the plaintiff should be ordered to submit a statement for correction and reschedule the trial.

### Authorities Assessing the Cost of Goods, Retail Prices Will Be Re-controlled, Deadline for Manufacturers to Report Costs is End of Month

The Materials Control Department of the Public Works Department previously stipulated that the prices at which manufacturers and wholesalers sell goods in the Public Concession must not exceed the price tags on January 23, and ordered all manufacturers and wholesalers to list the cost calculation and the price set on January 23 and submit them to the Materials Control Department for review by the end of this month. Currently, the guilds of various industries are rushing to submit the relevant information to the authorities within the deadline. According to sources, the Public Works Department's assessment of the manufacturing and wholesale prices of goods this time is actually a prelude to considering the re-control of retail prices. It reverses the previous practice by first assessing the manufacturing costs, legitimate profits, and wholesale prices, and then stabilizing retail prices within reasonable limits, in order to eliminate the possibility of retailers taking the increased purchase price as an excuse to raise prices privately. The investigation and cost calculation departments under the Materials Control Department are stepping up their work to make the price limits for manufacturing, wholesale, and retail of goods in this city into a new system, so that speculative merchants cannot use their tricks, and so that the guilds of various industries can assist the authorities in implementing price policies within this new system.

### Sudden Change in Mindset of British and Americans, Willing to Live in Concentration Camps, Rather Than Risk Crossing the Ocean to Retreat Home, Better to Live in a Camp and Ensure Safety

(Special Report) The news that people from enemy countries such as Britain and the United States in Shanghai will be taken into "concentration camps," which was first published in this newspaper with official confirmation, has added a lot of talking points after tea and dinner. Some people say that they used to be too arrogant and overbearing, but now things have turned around, and they may become prisoners, which is truly fair and gratifying. Some people express regret and sigh for the sudden change in their situation. The world is changing and human affairs are unpredictable, which is nothing more than creating many handles for those who are accustomed to complaining about the world and criticizing customs.

Speaking of "concentration camps," it seems that everyone is talking about tigers and changing their faces, and everyone is in danger. Those who have read Jan Valtin's famous novel "Out of the Night" will definitely resent the inhumane situation in "concentration camps" in a certain European country, which seems to be a living hell on earth, and once you enter, there is no life. However, the "concentration camp" mentioned here, where some British and Americans have already entered and some are about to enter, its official name is "Civil Assembly Center." According to Hirota, the information minister of the Japanese embassy, the concentration of British and Americans is only for "military needs" and is not intended to give them bad treatment.

I remember a few days after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, someone asked a Japanese military spokesman whether the British and Americans in Shanghai would enter concentration camps. The answer was very clever: "Shanghai itself is a large concentration camp." At that time, everyone congratulated the British and Americans, and the expatriates of the belligerent countries could still maintain considerable freedom. Later, this "large concentration camp" was reduced to areas other than restaurants, dining rooms, dance halls, and theaters. There were more foreigners on the street with red cloths tied on their arms with "A," "B," or "X" written on them. Generally, black Americans and some foreigners who have always been regarded as stateless or mixed-race unexpectedly surrounded the red cloth of "A" or "B" on their arms and proudly regarded themselves as excellent ethnic groups. Unexpectedly, how long has passed, the people with red armbands will disappear into the "concentration camp" so quickly.

The status of British and Americans in Shanghai has always been too high. They lived a more comfortable and comfortable life than anyone else. Especially when foreign exchange was tight, one US dollar could be fully exchanged for more than 30 Chinese yuan. Moreover, prices were not as high as they are now. Earning gold ocean dollars and using Chinese legal currency, who can match the satisfaction of material enjoyment? General bank managers, foreign firm managers, hotel owners, stockbrokers, real estate developers, and civil servants have made a fortune. They live in noble foreign houses, drive streamlined cars, and eat delicious Western food. Who doesn't envy them? Now, houses and properties are managed by the military, and furniture for making money is affixed with seals that cannot be moved. The economic source is completely exhausted. Large restaurants can only be visited but not enjoyed. Drama and movies cannot be appreciated, and they even have to enter concentration camps. Fortunately, they have enjoyed it too much in the past, so it is right to tighten their belts and endure it.

Perhaps some of them will complain about their misfortune. Why didn't they follow the advice of the government authorities to retreat before the war? That was in 1940. At that time, the situation in the Far East was urgent. The US government dispatched three large ships to China to evacuate overseas Chinese. No less than 3,000 women, children, and men who "did not need to live" took the opportunity to return home. Later, Britain followed suit and dispatched Taikoo ships to transport a large number of expatriates from Shanghai to India and Australia. However, at that time, both Britain and the United States always believed that people who were sufficient to "fly the flag" must continue to stay, so diplomatic officials such as consuls, important figures in the industrial, commercial, and financial circles still stayed in their positions. When everyone thought that the Pacific War that would not break out would eventually break out, diplomatic officials and well-known people retreated in exchange, and those who are still left now have a share in entering the "concentration camp."

In fact, after the Nanjing government declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9, the British and Americans in Shanghai were prepared to enter the "concentration camp." Although the rumors were mixed, they were still calm as always. Some even rushed to pack their luggage early. If someone asked, "I heard that you will be concentrated," their answer was often, "We are ready," and their attitude was very firm. Of course, no one can deny that every people should fully represent the national character of a country, and that spirit of not avoiding danger for the sake of the country and maintaining the dignity of the country is worth emulating.

Where exactly will they be concentrated? It is said that it is near the concession and western Shanghai, farther away in Pudong and Wusong, and farthest away in Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and Hangzhou. Probably a week before the designated concentration date, they will receive the order from Japanese Consul General Tajiri and go to the designated place to gather on the designated date, and then enter the pre-arranged "concentration camp" in a team. Personal utensils, bedding, clothing, tableware, and books can be brought in, but the quantity is limited to what can be contained in four small boxes. The original residence and the furniture in the house will be taken over by the Japanese military authorities.

What is life like in the "concentration camp?" It is not easy to know because people who have entered the "concentration camp" cannot reveal the situation inside, and people who have not entered the "concentration camp" cannot enjoy the right to visit it first. It is said that everything in the "concentration camp" is operated by the concentrators themselves, and all food, laundry, cleaning, and labor are handled by themselves. Single men are concentrated together, and families are also together, regardless of age, and treated equally. It is also said that there is a "concentration camp" in western Shanghai, which is the original site of a university. The dormitory has become the bedroom of the concentrators, one room for four men and one room for four women, separated from each other. This probably refers to married couples, and although family members can be in the same camp, they cannot live in the same room. The concentration work may be completed this month, and two batches will enter the camp on the 25th and 28th respectively.

Recently, I asked an American, "Is there still hope for retreat?"

"I don't want to retreat anymore," he said with interest, "Because rather than crossing the Atlantic Ocean and risking being attacked by submarines to retreat home, I would rather stay here safely and live in a concentration camp. Fortunately, the war will eventually end."

This is a sudden change in the mindset of the British and Americans.

### Reforming the Ticket Selling System on Public Trolleys

— Wu Xinmin

The trend of ticket sellers embezzling money on trams seems to have intensified recently, which is of course a huge loophole for the company. Passengers often indulge and encourage this behavior without correcting it, which promotes the rise in ticket prices. In the end, they themselves suffer the loss. I hereby put forward the following suggestions, hoping that the authorities will thoroughly reform.

(1) Abolish the on-board ticket selling system and replace it with ticket booths at each station. Passengers must purchase tickets at the station before boarding. Absolutely no tickets will be sold on the bus.

(2) Set up a gatekeeper who specializes in opening the doors at each level of the car. Passengers must hand over their tickets to the gatekeeper for tearing up when getting off the car.

(3) Adjust the location of each station and extend the distance between the stations as much as possible so that the distance between each station is equal, so that it is easy to manage and the fares are equal to the distance. There will be absolutely no situation where one station is cheap and another station suffers.

(4) Issue more preferential tickets such as monthly and seasonal tickets, because this can also help a lot of convenience in business.

(5) The salaries of employees should be increased according to the level of living to ensure their lives, so that they no longer think about fraud. At the same time, when fraudulent behavior is discovered, severe punishment should be imposed, such as suspension, etc., to make them wary.

### Residents of Western Shanghai Should Quickly Apply for Licenses for Self-Defense Guns

The Shanghai West Police Department's verification of self-defense guns in the area has been approved by the Municipal Government, and the department will handle the license issuance procedures. According to reporters, the department has now been issued a type C six-part self-defense firearm license by the Municipal Government. Starting today, the second section of the department will handle the verification and license issuance procedures. Except for the firearm licenses required by military agencies and active military personnel of various units, which should be obtained from the Ministry of Military Affairs in accordance with regulations, people and legal entities and personnel of government agencies who have self-defense guns and live within the jurisdiction of the department should go to apply for licenses to comply with the regulations.

### To Eliminate Abuses in Public Rice Sales in Western Shanghai, "Materials Rationing Certificates" Will Be Issued, Rice Will Be Issued With Certificates to Prevent Profiteering by Unscrupulous Elements, Census Will Be Conducted First, and Households Will Be Checked One by One

Since being ordered to handle public rice sales, the Shanghai West District Office has found that its jurisdiction is vast and the situation is complicated, resulting in unscrupulous elements taking the opportunity to use their powers to falsely report and embezzle. The supervisory authorities have repeatedly discovered this matter and are deeply angered. In addition to thoroughly investigating those who commit fraud, they will also conduct a preliminary census and then check the households in the entire district one by one. The district office will reissue household registration certificates, and in order to prevent unscrupulous elements from committing fraud, it will change to issuing "Materials Rationing Certificates" and issue rice with certificates. It has now been reported to the Municipal Government, and it can be implemented as soon as it is approved.

### Quantity of Rice for the 28th Period Household Registration is Still 2.5 Sheng, Whole Rice May Increase to 2 Sheng, Bicycle Ration and Miscellaneous Grains Twice Next Month

In order to fully ration food to Shanghai citizens, the authorities have ordered foreign rice from Thailand and Vietnam to be transported to Shanghai to provide relief, and have also purchased domestic rice from various districts in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. At the same time, they have purchased flour produced by flour mills in Central China. Now, in view of the fact that foreign rice has been continuously transported to Shanghai, the purchase of domestic rice has been quite successful, and the output of flour from various factories has increased, it has been decided to make the rationed food for each person meet the proper needs of each person. Regarding the 28th period household registration grain, according to a report by our reporter to the rice industry yesterday, 644 registered rice shops in the Public Concession and the French Concession yesterday received purchase orders from the rice and flour rationing office for whole rice, broken rice, and flour. The quantity is the same as last period, but the quantity of whole rice has increased and the quantity of broken rice has decreased compared to before. According to this calculation, the next period's household registration grain is 2 sheng of whole rice, 0.5 sheng of broken rice, and 1.75 lbs of flour.

Registered Rice Shops Have Already Taken Delivery

As for the price of registered rice shops, whole rice and broken rice are both 304 yuan per 200 jin bag, and flour is 92 yuan per 49 pound bag. The selling price is 6.3 yuan for 2.5 sheng of whole rice and broken rice, and 3.85 yuan for 1.75 lbs of flour, totaling 10.015 yuan. However, the so-called whole rice includes white rice and brown rice. It is understood that various registered rice shops have paid the payment and taken delivery from the designated Taikoo Warehouse, Zhejiang Xingye Warehouse, Mitsubishi Wharf Warehouse, etc. They are allowed to be sold with rice purchase certificates and flour certificates from March 1, but the exact figures and prices are still subject to the announcement of the authorities.

Edible Oil Certificate Will Be Reissued Immediately

In addition, it is understood that miscellaneous grains can be purchased twice from March. These miscellaneous grains are mostly beans. The quantity, date, and price of each purchase will be determined by the Public Works Department in a public announcement. As for the three types of purchase certificates for oil, sugar, and miscellaneous grains, in addition to the sugar purchase certificate being issued together by the rice purchase certificate issuing offices starting yesterday, the reissue dates for the miscellaneous grain certificate and the edible oil certificate have already been arranged, and they can be issued together starting on the 26th.

### French Concession Sends Personnel to Inspect Scales in Various Shops, Cracking Down on Irregularities, Accepting and Exchanging Red Gold Business

In order to crack down on black market transactions by unscrupulous merchants and curb price increases in the concession, the city concession authorities dispatched a large number of plainclothes detectives the day before yesterday to inspect the scales used in various shops in the concession. Anyone found to be illegally deducting weight will be severely investigated and punished. Yesterday morning, they sent personnel to crack down on the irregular business of accepting and exchanging new and old red gold and foreign gold at high prices attached to various shops in the concession and removed their storefronts. They also found several photography shops that illegally raised prices and ordered them to restore the original prices and not to raise them privately.

### Current Issues - Secretary-General Zhao of the Municipal Government Broadcasts Yesterday

Secretary-General Zun Yue of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, at the invitation of the Shanghai Broadcasting Station, delivered a speech on the platform at 7:30 PM yesterday to celebrate the second anniversary of the China Broadcasting Association. The topic was "Several Current Issues," and the content elaborated in detail on how the people should cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. The original words are recorded below:

Today is the second anniversary of the Broadcasting Association. Everyone knows the achievements of the Broadcasting Association, but its significance and spirit are still worth mentioning as an introduction to today's speech.

Looking back to two years ago, when the Broadcasting Association was just established, it was also shortly after the National Government returned to the capital. Since Mr. Wang advocated the peace movement and the enthusiastic support of a group of people, it took a considerable amount of time to achieve the goal of returning to the capital. However, although it was said to be returning to the capital at that time, it was as difficult as starting from scratch. When we first arrived in the capital, broken houses and dilapidated walls, and desolation met the eye. The situation of the people being displaced was truly moving, but at the same time, it further aroused our courage. No matter what, we must achieve the goal of national rejuvenation. We must overcome all hardships and difficulties. Under the leadership of the Chairman, we must fulfill our aspirations. In this way, day by day, although there are many difficulties, the achievements are gradually progressing. For example, the Broadcasting Association was also established shortly after the return to the capital. Since the establishment of the Broadcasting Association, look at the construction of radio stations everywhere. It has progressed rapidly. All parts of the country, regardless of the distance of the location or the number of people, can be together. It simply broke the limitations of time and space. Not only can we get political news and normal entertainment, but we can also listen to the leader's instructions at any time and uplift our spirits. In particular, the Chairman recently instructed us on three points, namely, maintaining law and order, training the people, and increasing production, which are worthy of our attention.

The issue of maintaining law and order. Everyone may think that this is a matter for the military and police, and not necessarily the responsibility of every individual. However, everyone should know that if law and order are achieved through the efforts of every person, the military and police will achieve twice the result with half the effort. Currently, the strength of the military and police is generally increasing, especially in the work of the Qingxiang District, which is particularly diligent. But where is this foundation? The most important work is still in the Baojia system. The people cannot all become soldiers and police, but everyone is incorporated into the Baojia system. If the Baojia system is well managed, every move will be investigated. Of course, to put it mildly, bandits cannot sneak in. To put it bluntly, no large-scale roving bandits can attack villages and rob houses. So I say, as long as everyone pays attention to the Baojia system and at the same time pays attention to all the unusual movements, and does it according to the procedures, the maintenance of law and order will definitely be no problem.

Training the people is the most important thing. We not only train from schools, but also from all aspects. Schools can cultivate a person's knowledge, but if a group of people are to become modern and good citizens, schools cannot bear this responsibility. The Chairman himself also serves as the Chairman of the New National Movement Association, which is the meaning of this. The country needs scholars, but also needs citizens, especially strong citizens. Therefore, school education is to teach people knowledge, and the New National Movement is to train people to be human beings, starting from childhood, participating in youth groups, and doing it from the aspects of etiquette and physique. People with knowledge can of course use their strengths to take responsibility for the country and do things. However, if the general public does not meet the qualifications of citizens, that country cannot be maintained by a few people, let alone in the current era of participating in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, training the people is definitely not the exclusive responsibility of education, or teachers and students, but the business of the general public in the society. In any case, those who know should teach those who do not know, and training a good citizen for the country is indeed fulfilling the greatest responsibility for the country, and also fulfilling the responsibility of revitalizing China.

Increasing production. Some people may think that increasing production cannot be done without large-scale factories and collective farms with thousands of acres of land. This is really not right. We must know that large-scale can indeed greatly increase production, and a small number of people can also accumulate small amounts into large amounts. We should know that in terms of quantity, if everyone weaves one more foot of cloth every day, the increased production will be very considerable. In terms of region, if farmers who plant fields and vegetables plant more along the river and on the hillside, the increased production will be even greater. Moreover, the autonomous small-scale increase in production in various places is much simpler than large-scale equipment, but the results are the same. The ancients had a sentence to scold people, called "idleness and laziness." This is the meaning of opposing people not engaging in production since ancient China. If we compare it again, the people in the countryside are really working hard to increase production, because they rely on this for a living. There are many opportunities to make money in the city, and they are not willing to do practical things. This point should be paid special attention to and taken as a warning. Furthermore, under the leadership of the Chairman in building the country, we should know more that we should go from revitalizing China to defending East Asia. This is not only China's need, but also China's responsibility. Especially Japan's hope for China is like this.

Extraterritoriality. Since the National Government declared its participation in the war, we have naturally been fulfilling the responsibility of a member of East Asia from an autonomous standpoint. However, because we have already participated in the war and stand on the same front, Japan has also automatically announced the abolition of extraterritoriality and the two major issues of returning concessions. Everyone should know that extraterritoriality is a matter of foreigners using their laws to enforce the laws of their own people within our country. In the current civilized environment, regarding laws, it has long been the principle of territoriality, not the principle of personality. All existence of the principle of personality can be regarded as a method of civilized people for uncivilized people, because they believe that the laws here are not applicable to civilized people. However, we Chinese laws must know that they are absolutely the laws of civilized people. However, foreigners have always underestimated China, so they have ignored the spirit of Chinese rule of law, and even today, they still do not believe us and adopt the principle of personality. In fact, all countries in the world study ancient Chinese law, especially the most perfect law of the Tang Dynasty, which has long become an important subject in world jurisprudence. However, because they do not attach importance to China, even ancient Chinese civilization is only provided for research in academic history, and they are not willing to apply it to modern times. Therefore, they have always refused to abolish the item of legal rights. However, Japan understands this point. In the position that we are all masters of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, he automatically announced the abolition of extraterritoriality. Originally, Japan's research on China is more detailed than that of Britain and the United States, and everyone is of the same race, respecting China and hoping for China's ideals, which cannot be compared with the hypocrisy of Britain and the United States. It seems that they resolutely abolished extraterritoriality. This really contains several meanings. First, it admits that Chinese law is suitable for modern application. Second, it admits that China is qualified enough not to adopt the principle of personality in law. Third, it proves that we are all members of Greater East Asia and should cooperate and coexist and prosper together. We have accepted Japan's kindness, and the people will naturally be more excited and make extra efforts to fulfill our responsibilities.

In addition to returning concessions, we must talk about the issue of returning concessions. We all know that it is most unreasonable for other countries to have concessions within our national borders, especially since these concessions were left over from defeats a hundred years ago, which is even more painful for the people. It is originally a very ordinary thing for the people of the two countries to trade and conduct commerce. Why should a special area be set aside that is not under the administrative system of this country? Our history of the past 100 years will be settled sooner or later. However, because of imperialism, for the sake of exploitation, this issue was never discussed no matter how good the diplomatic relations were in the past. However, this time, Japan, in order to respect our country and at the same time hope that China will use its autonomous spirit to jointly fulfill the responsibility of building Greater East Asia, resolutely announced the return of concessions. This kind of kindness is of course deeply appreciated by any Chinese people. However, it goes without saying that concessions have the disadvantages of concessions, but they also have the advantages of concessions. We don't have to obliterate everything. The material equipment, commercial prosperity, and other international characteristics, we are not unwelcome to foreign residents, and we are willing to maintain their equipment characteristics and everything else, especially all the equipment can be used for our use, as long as we intensify the use, all the places that should be preserved, so that the people in the city can live and work in peace and enjoy more, can achieve the effectiveness of increasing production. We must know that our recovery of concessions is not just a recovery in law and name, nor is it just a recovery of foreign houses and roads, and then it is over. We must strive to use the existing foundation after the recovery, and run it into the most ideal city, and make it play a greater effect. Regarding this point, I think everyone must have the same heart and the same reason. In short, we, as modern people, must fulfill modern responsibilities. To fulfill responsibilities, we must first understand everything. To understand everything, we must also pay attention at all times. However, this is not necessarily learned from books. For example, the Broadcasting Association can be regarded as serving the public and paying attention to all issues. This function, on the one hand, is to maintain politics for the country, and on the other hand, it is to serve the public, which is worthy of admiration. I hope everyone will not ignore it, and should use this opportunity as much as possible at any time. At the same time, we should also wish the Broadcasting Association a prosperous career and unlimited future. We must know that the success of the Broadcasting Association can reflect the revival of the Republic of China.

### Transportation Routes are Smooth and Unobstructed - There is No Worry of Fuel Shortage in this City - Existing Stock is Sufficient to Cope Fully

Due to the active increase in prices of various foods and daily necessities in this port, a reporter from the Datong News Agency specially inquired with the local fuel industry authorities yesterday about the stock and transportation of goods in the industry. The following is a record of what they said:

Fuel Transportation to Shanghai is Continuous

Since last winter, a large amount of coal has been transported into this port. At present, firewood transported to Shanghai by ordinary villagers from the vicinity of Suzhou is also continuous. Therefore, the fuel required by residents in various districts of Shanghai has not experienced the slightest shortage. Moreover, the original stock in this port, according to the estimate in early winter last year, is sufficient to fully cope with the needs of this port. Because of the smooth transportation routes and the abundance of stock, the fuel item alone can stand still amid this price increase of all things.

Consumption Last Winter Decreased Significantly

According to the survey results, the consumption of fuel in this port last winter was actually lower than in previous years. It is said that the reason is that most residents can save on their own. Finally, it was said that in order to prevent a few coal merchants from imitating the trend during this period of soaring prices of all things, the authorities have strictly controlled the supply of coal and firewood, so as to prevent hoarding and speculation and black market activities.

### A General Discussion of Malaya (1)

- Voters

(1) Geographical Situation of Malaya

The former British Malaya starts from 6 degrees 43 minutes and 41 seconds north latitude, extends to 1 degree 15 minutes and 43 seconds south latitude at the southern end of Singapore, faces Borneo across the South China Sea to the east, confronts the northern part of Sumatra across the Strait of Malacca to the southwest, and borders Thailand to the north, facing Myanmar. The total area reaches 137,776.27 square kilometers (53,211.0 square miles).

The ground of Malaya is rugged and hilly, with mountain ranges running through the center, slightly deviating to the west side of the peninsula. The rivers are very short, of which the Perak River and the Pahang River are more important. However, the coast is tortuous and there are many natural good harbors. Both sides are sheltered by Sumatra, and there are not many storms. The east coast faces the South China Sea, and when the northeast monsoon wind rises, the wind and waves are not small.

Malaya is close to the equator, so it is like summer all year round. Fortunately, the sea breeze regulates it, and it is not very hot. The rainfall is very high, and it rains almost every other day. After the rain, it is as cool as autumn, and the summer heat disappears. Therefore, there is a popular saying that "four seasons are like summer, and a rain turns into autumn."

The population of Malaya, according to the estimate at the end of 1939, was a total of 5,396,706 people. The most outstanding phenomenon is that the population of our overseas Chinese accounts for the largest majority of the total population of Malaya, totaling 2,300,353 people. They mainly engage in commerce and mining, especially in the rubber industry and tin mining. The second are Malays, Indians, and there are also many Japanese residents. In addition, there are Europeans, Javanese, Annamese, Thais, Filipinos, and Eurasian mixed races. Malays mostly engage in agricultural labor, and Indians mostly engage in rubber tree planting. Among Europeans, the British account for the largest number, controlling the political and economic power, and are the rulers and exploiters of Malaya.

The population growth rate of Malaya is very high. In the recent 30 years, it has almost doubled. The main reason is due to the rapid development of the rubber and tin industries, which led to the increase in immigration to Malaya. The following table can show the population increase in recent years:

(1) Situation of Population Increase in Malaya (Unit: 1,000 people)

(2) Situation of Population Increase in Malaya (Unit: 1,000 people)

(Note) (1) Includes Christmas Island and Cocos Island, (2) Includes the cities of Buloh Pinang, Wellesley, and Taiping; (3) At the time of the survey, there were still 1,496 unsettled people.

(3) Population Statistics by Ethnic Group in Malaya in 1939

(One person per square mile)

(Density is the number of people per square mile.)

(2) A Summary of the History of Aggression by the Powers

Strictly speaking, the former British Malaya is divided into three parts: one is the Straits Settlements, including Singapore Island, Penang, Malacca, etc.; two is the Federated Malay States, including Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, etc.; and three is the Unfederated Malay States, composed of Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis, Terengganu, etc., as well as Sarawak in Borneo, Brunei, Labuan Island, British North Borneo, Cocos Island (also known as Keeling Island), Christmas Island, and other British-owned islands. However, the British administrative divisions actually refer to the three as Malaya in general.

Historically, there have been records about Malaya in very ancient times. As early as 300 years before the Christian era, Ptolemy, who succeeded Alexander the Great as King of Egypt, is said to have known about the tin production in Malaya. There are even records in Arabic historical books of the ninth century about the tin production in the west coast of Malaya called "Kilah", which is actually today's Kedah. In fact, if we carefully examine ancient Chinese books, the ancient historical records about Malaya may be even more detailed.

The development of Singapore Island dates back 800 years ago. At that time, the people of Sumatra first went to the island, cleared the way through brambles and thorns, and gradually became known to all parties after 200 years. Later, it was invaded by King Megapit of Java, and the island was abandoned again as a fishing village, but the residents moved north to Malacca to engage in construction. Later, Malacca became a center of the Malay Peninsula because it was a key point of maritime transportation.

The first white people to discover Malaya were also those who discovered Malacca. The first Portuguese Gama (Vasco de Gama) to reach the East led 20 warships to India for the second time in 1502 and had extremely cordial relations with the Indian princes, gaining the establishment of commercial bases in several places. In 1503, the Portuguese Albufuerque (Affomso d`Albugurepue) consolidated the base in India, served as the "Governor" of India, and later occupied Ceylon and then Malacca, establishing a trading house here as a base for advancing eastward. At that time, there was no rubber, no oil and tin, and what Europeans were pursuing was the spices that were special products of the South. Therefore, at that time, the road that went north across the Tianshan Mountains to China to obtain silk was called the "Silk Road", while the road that went south across Malacca out of the South China Sea to obtain Nanyang spices was called the Spice Road. Therefore, once white people appeared on the Malay Peninsula, it began the fate of being invaded and plundered.

The Portuguese occupied Malacca for about a century, until 1641 when it was taken by the Dutch. The Dutch also occupied Malacca for a century. In 1824, the British returned Sumatra to the Dutch and exchanged it for Malacca. However, the British had already obtained Penang from the Sultan of Kedah in 1786 through the East India Company with an annual fee of 6,000 yuan, and built a base for dominating Nanyang there. At that time, colonial activities were mostly focused on the competition for key points in trade and transportation, aiming to maintain port cities, and the Malay Peninsula was turned into a chessboard for Western powers to divide and occupy. However, the British had a particularly favorable position in Malaya due to the enhancement of their progress after the industrial revolution. In addition to exchanging for Malacca, it also used the old trick of piracy to plunder land in Nanyang, such as Wellesley across from Penang, and Pangkor Island, Simbilan Island, etc., and forcibly took them as its own protectorates, such as Selangor, etc., and sometimes even forcibly obtained free trade rights to support its power, taking advantage of opportunities to gradually make the entire Malay Peninsula fall under the control of the British Empire. Thus, at the beginning of the 20th century, the so-called Straits Settlements were formed, and Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, and Pangkor were organized into a federation, while in other non-federated states, British "advisers" controlled the actual ruling power. This is how they ruled Malaya for about 150 years, until the start of the Greater East Asia War, when they were driven out by the Japanese army, ending the history of the British Empire monopolizing the natural resources of Malaya and exploiting the blood and tears of its residents.

### Promoting the Future of Hygiene Undertakings - The Authorities Promote Hygiene Work - Various Hygiene Propaganda Campaigns Have Been Effective - Hoping that Residents Will Jointly Take Responsibility for Persistent Progress

The hygiene authorities of the two concessions, because the statistics of diseases and deaths of residents in this port have not shown a significant decrease, have held various hygiene campaigns in the past year to enable residents to understand various hygiene common sense,

Repeatedly Held Propaganda Campaigns

In the past year, the various hygiene propaganda campaigns launched by the two concessions include vaccination, rat extermination and epidemic prevention, banning the sale of pufferfish, and banning spitting everywhere. The direct reasons are to prevent smallpox, prevent the occurrence of plague, prevent the spread of cholera, eliminate poisoning situations, and reduce the spread of diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy, and colds. Indirectly, it is also hoped that every resident will pay attention to health work

Clean Up Street and Alley Filth

The hygiene authorities said that the results of the above-mentioned campaigns and propaganda have been effective, and expressed that this is the bright future of public hygiene undertakings in Shanghai, and said that in the future, in addition to supervising residents to jointly take responsibility for the various hygiene undertakings that have been promoted and not to be lazy, other matters such as the mess of fruit peels on the road, the accumulation of garbage in the alleys, and the stagnant water in low-lying ground will also be cleaned up. On the one hand, they will order the small workers (i.e., street sweepers) or foremen responsible for cleaning to step up their work, and on the other hand, they hope that residents will pay attention to themselves,

Send Personnel to Re-examine Unclean Households

As for the residents' own houses, the hygiene authorities will also pay considerable attention to them in the future. During the first period of the campaign to ban spitting everywhere, the hygiene department sent personnel to various small alleys with dense crowds to conduct investigations, and advised the heads of households to be responsible for organizing and cleaning up everything inside the house. It is reported that during the most recent period, the hygiene department will also send the original investigators to conduct re-examinations of various households.

### Authorities Consider Merging Small Banks, Pawnshops, and Insurance Companies: Concrete Plan Not Yet Officially Decided

Since the outbreak of the Pacific War in this city, the excessive amount of floating capital has led to a distorted development of the financial industry. The establishment of banks, pawnshops, and insurance companies in the past year has been as numerous as bamboo shoots after a rain. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance, in order to strictly manage financial institutions, specifically ordered that the establishment of financial institutions be restricted, and that no new ones be established from this year onward, except for those specially approved. However, since this spring, 13 new banks have opened, and 12 new pawnshops have opened. There are about 10 banks and 8 pawnshops currently preparing to open. The registration procedures for these newly established banks and pawnshops had already been completed, so they are not within the Ministry of Finance's order of restriction. However, this reporter from Commercial News has learned that the relevant authorities believe that the excessive number of newly established banks, pawnshops, and insurance companies may have an adverse impact on the city's finances, and that it is necessary to merge small banks, pawnshops, and insurance companies. The relevant departments are now meticulously studying a concrete plan, and once a solution is decided, it may be formally promulgated, but it will still take a considerable amount of time.

Economic Commentary

### Wishes of the Private Economic Sector

The evolution of Shanghai's economy over the past year has been a magnificent spectacle, and the emerging enterprises have presented an unprecedented situation. In this era of controlled economy being implemented, entrepreneurs themselves should clearly recognize the surrounding environment in which they are situated, adapt to the trends of the times, and operate their businesses in a stable manner to achieve a rationalized position. At the same time, the government should bear in mind that without the cooperation of the private sector when implementing this planned economic policy, it will often be inefficient and difficult to achieve results. Therefore, the government also has several responsibilities:

First, it should expand its service scope as much as possible to supplement the shortcomings of private enterprises. Efforts should be made to construct and thoroughly improve transportation, public works, etc., such as the National Resources Committee of the United States, the National Controlled Business Committee of the United Kingdom, and the Cooperation Committee of Italy.

Second, it should assist enterprises, such as the Industrial Rationalization Bureau of Japan and the Production Promotion Committee of Denmark, which provide strong technical assistance from the government. Also, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation of the United States and the Rediscount and Guarantee Bureau of Germany and Belgium are characteristics of government financial assistance.

Third, it should protect the public, promote commercial ethics, and promote industrial safety to ensure the integrity of the economic system. For example, the quality statistics of trademarks and commodities in Europe and Japan, the regulations on fair competition and honest advertising in the United States, and the strict management of markets are all the inherent responsibilities of the government when implementing a controlled economy.

Regarding the above three points, it is hoped that the upper and lower levels will cooperate and work together towards the same goal, step by step, striving for effective and rational production on the one hand, and fair and rational disposal on the other. For example, under the current requirements of a wartime economy, it is necessary to quickly establish a formal market for the public trading of Chinese stocks. It is hoped that the authorities, based on the local environment and with reference to the established practices of various countries, will convene reputable representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors to jointly discuss the establishment of a formal stock market; at the same time, they should instruct the stock industry to organize a formal association to engage in the proper operation of Chinese stocks in accordance with laws and regulations, so that industrial and commercial enterprises can obtain flexible capital production and development through normal Chinese stock transactions. What great fortune this would be.

From another perspective, the private economic sector during wartime should understand the current situation, recognize its position, and strive to operate conscientiously and in a spirit of division of labor and cooperation. In particular, it is necessary to connect internally and externally, communicate effectively, and adjust deficits and surpluses appropriately. It should be like the snake of Changshan, responding at every joint, and like the body using its arms and the arms using its fingers, without any disconnections or defects. Then, even in any difficult environment, the emerging Chinese business community will surely stabilize its position, expand its business, and stand firmly in an unbreakable state.

### Uniform Purchase and Rationing of Flour in Shanghai, Suzhou, and Wuxi: Purchase Price at 85 Yuan per Bag

(D) The flour held by members of the Mill Association will be delivered to the designated warehouse in full. (E) Future flour producers will be allowed to follow the regulations on the left: (1) Deliver the goods to the warehouse designated by the association, and receive the full amount of cash at the same time. (2) All the stock in the warehouses of the flour mills will be supplied to the flour combination. (3) The flour held by flour sellers who are not members of the Flour Association shall be treated in the same way as the members of the Association holding flour. The flour held by small flour producers who are members of the Mill Association, as well as future products, shall also be handled in the same way as the flour and future products held by members of the Mill Association.

If the inspector still has doubts, he can conduct further inspections with the company or the agency that collects the shares.

### Rationing of Oil and Sugar per Capita to be Implemented on the 1st and 2nd: Quantities Agreed Upon, But Still Awaiting Approval

After the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office and the Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office were approved by the military rationing authorities to implement rationing of oil and sugar per capita, specific measures have been decided: (1) The affairs of issuing certificates for per capita rationing in the Public Concession (including Hongkou) and the French Concession will be entrusted to the authorities of the two concessions.

### The Philippine Economy Has Entered a Healthy State

Manila, February 21st (Allied News Agency): The Philippine economy, under the administration of the Japanese army for the past year, has reached a healthy state in both industry and agriculture. Since occupying the Philippines, the Japanese army has begun to promote Philippine production enterprises from the long-term plan of economic self-sufficiency. Recently, the production of food has increased, and the price of food has been unified. In addition, the transportation business has been restored and manufacturing factories have gradually resumed work. What is especially commendable is that a large amount of funds has been used to purchase surplus products between morning villages—especially sugar—to regulate rural finance. In addition, Japanese agricultural technology is used to increase the rice production in the Philippines, because rice is the main food of the Filipinos.

In addition, such items as cotton, alcohol, soap, and vegetable oil are all entrusted to the Filipinos for self-cultivation, self-production, and self-sufficiency. In addition to self-sufficiency, the surplus raw materials can also be supplied to Japan's domestic industrial manufacturing. With the natural richness of the Philippine Islands and the superiority of Japanese agricultural technology, its future is limitless.

### Rapid Progress of the Shanghai Rubber Industry: Rubber Shoes are the Main Manufactured Product

Among the emerging industries in Shanghai that have emerged, the rubber products manufacturing industry should be the first to be promoted. Although the rubber industry does not have a long history in Shanghai's industrial history, its position in the current Shanghai industry is very important. According to reliable sources, about 60% of the rubber factories in Shanghai are currently in operation. The future of the rubber industry can be seen from the following phenomena to see the extent of its future development:

(1) Trade between Shanghai and various parts of Nanyang is being restored. Once this connection is restored, rubber raw materials can be smoothly and continuously imported into Shanghai to supply the manufacturing needs of various rubber factories here. It should be known that the main reason for the sluggishness of Shanghai's rubber industry in recent years is the lack of rubber raw materials.

(2) Since Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce in East Asia, the rubber products manufactured here will be supplied to other parts of China and other countries in East Asia. After Shanghai's industry and commerce return to normal development, there will inevitably be a wider demand for rubber products manufactured in Shanghai.

(3) Changes in the economic situation have increased the use of rubber. For example, the authorities here have heard that the use of leather shoes is no longer allowed, so the only alternative is rubber shoes. The second is tires, because bicycles are currently popular in Shanghai, so tires can also promote the rapid progress of the rubber industry.

As for the items manufactured by the rubber factories here, it is estimated that 70% of them are rubber shoes, 15% are tires, and the remaining 15% are various daily necessities, including toys.

### Public Bonds are Eagerly Sought: -Very Few Transactions-

The market for public bonds continued to weaken yesterday, as people were slightly uneasy and more bonds were sought for sale. The initial price of Type C was around 7 yuan, down to 6 yuan, and saw a low price of 5.7 yuan, but later rose to 7 yuan, with extremely rare transactions. Type D was about 2 yuan, and Type E was about 3.5 to 3 yuan, with very few transactions. Most of the rest were not traded.

### Bean Cake Spot Prices Fall: Futures Market Maintains Status Quo

Yesterday, the spot market for bean cake gradually declined amid the voice of control, falling by three or four yuan compared to the previous price. The futures market was deadlocked between the bulls and bears, forming a revolving situation. It is estimated that: Yuanlong bean cake three carts, price was 117 yuan to 115 yuan, Qingzhong cake 500 pieces, price 85 yuan, Huishan cake February delivery 1,000 pieces, price 117 yuan, Li Zi cake two or three deliveries 2,000 pieces, price 117 yuan 25 cents to 117 yuan 50 cents, Xing Ji cake end of February delivery 2,000 pieces, price 119 yuan to 118 yuan 80 cents, Xing Ji and Li Zi cake March delivery 2,000 pieces, price 118 yuan 50 cents to 119 yuan, Shanghai factory cake February and March delivery 2,000 pieces, price 119 yuan to 120 yuan, Fei Zi cake one or two weeks delivery two carts, price 120 yuan 05 cents to 120 yuan. It was also heard that the Mixed Grain Group's flat-price cake of 50,000 pieces will change the delivery method in order to avoid investigation by the authorities.

### Candle Soap Prices Rise Endlessly: Hoarders Still Buying

The market for daily necessities remains strong. As each cargo station is at its peak, new hoarders still want to buy, which leads to the endless rise in prices of each item. For example, Gu Ben soap was shouted up to a new high price of 1,000 yuan, Bai Xiang Mao soap 940 yuan, Huang Xiang Mao 880 yuan, Scissors soap 960 yuan, ten yuan more expensive than the previous day. Phoenix brand matches 5,500 yuan, Beauty brand 5,700 yuan, Golden Cauldron brand 4,300 yuan, Miscellaneous brand 3,000 yuan. White Li's wax candles 650 yuan, Monk Hat brand 540 yuan, Miscellaneous brand 400 yuan, all rising strongly.

### Famous Chinese and Japanese Banks to Hold Informal Meeting

It is reported that in order to adapt to the new situation after the National Government entered the war and to strengthen the cooperation between Chinese and Japanese banks, powerful Chinese and Japanese banks will hold an informal meeting. The Chinese side will include major banks such as Jin Cheng, China, and Communications, and the Japanese side will include banks such as Zhengjin, Korea, Taiwan, and Mitsui. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, although the Chinese banks have moved in the direction of Sino-Japanese cooperation, the economic situation of each party has not yet reached the realm of complete cooperation. According to the exchange of deposits between Chinese and Japanese banks last year, the total amount of deposits of Japanese banks in Chinese banks was 000,000 yuan (excluding the Reserve Bank). The total amount of deposits of Chinese banks in the six major Japanese banks was also 000,000 yuan. The difference between the two sides was equal, which is equivalent to no interaction. It is extremely difficult to introduce the national capital of the Chinese side. However, after the National Government entered the war, all trade allocation, and purchases, etc., the Chinese and Japanese sides are in the same conditions. Therefore, the scope of responsibility of the Chinese financial community is also broad, which means that the contact with the Japanese banking community is expanding, and it is necessary to strengthen Sino-Japanese financial cooperation.

### Recent Progress of Various Industries in Shanghai: Based on the Percentage of Operating Machines

According to reliable sources in the Shanghai industrial community, as of the end of January 1943, the percentage of all machines in operation in Shanghai's various industries is as follows:

Type of Industry…Percentage of Machine Activity

Dyeing and Weaving…30%

Hardware…5%

Electrical…60%

Textile…65%

Chemical…80%

Printing…80%

Leather…45%

Mechanical…30%

Brewing…100%

Tobacco…100%

Flour…100%

Rubber…60%

From the table above, the machines of various industrial manufacturers in Shanghai that are in operation are on average from 30% to 80%. It can be seen that the industrial situation in Shanghai has made significant progress, especially the food industry. The tobacco item has also emerged, no wonder tobacco merchants have all made huge profits, and the stock prices of various tobacco companies—such as Nanyang Huacheng—have also continued to increase.

### Shanghai Charcoal Association Sends Personnel to Investigate Charcoal Production in Various Places

The Shanghai Charcoal Association had previously cut charcoal production methods last week to prevent the black market for charcoal, but the production matters must be carefully reviewed. A board meeting was held at the Japan Club on the 22nd. As a result, it was decided that Director Lin and others would lead an investigation team to conduct on-site investigations in Hangzhou, Wuhu, Chang'an, Huzhou, Jiaxing, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Zhenjiang, and Haimen.

### Household Medicines: No Major Fluctuations

The market for household medicines is still relatively calm, and the prices have not changed much. It is estimated that: headache powder 47 yuan, Bagua Dan 50 yuan 05 cents, Wan Jin oil 58 yuan, partridge vegetables 86 yuan, Dragon and Tiger Ren Dan 47 yuan, the previous prices are quite similar.

### Cigarette Sales are Not Strong: Market Prices are Stable but Weak

The cigarette market lacks the strength to rise, because customer sales are sluggish and the transportation is difficult. This sale is still balanced due to the supply, but fresh stomach. Therefore, the price is always stable, with very little fluctuation. It is estimated that: Great British brand 12,900 yuan, Old Knife brand 10,650 yuan, Pinhai brand 8,400 yuan, Fairy brand 8,400 yuan, Five Hua brand 7,400 yuan, Japanese cigarette Golden Gun brand 3,400 yuan, Golden Building 4,300 yuan, Red Rose 2,850 yuan, Quanlu brand 4,000 yuan, Nianxiao 3,500 yuan, Compass brand 3,400 yuan, National cigarette Pyramid 7,950 yuan, Beauty brand 7,150 yuan, Golden Mouse brand 4,400 yuan, Bai Jinlong 4,750 yuan, all the prices compared to the previous day are stable and weak.

### Black and White Pepper are Both Shouted Tight

Recently, black pepper has become tight due to absorption, and the market has become tight again. However, the number of transactions is not much, just to embellish the market. Yesterday's settlement was about 5% higher than before. All are No. 1 pepper, the price is roughly the same, white pepper is also slightly shouted up, and the market is firm.

### Jinshan Branches are Expensive

According to news from the Jinshan branch number, the production price is higher than the Shanghai market due to the exchange rate relationship. Therefore, the source has a temporary scarcity phenomenon. It is found that there are still many chips in the Shanghai market, so it is not easy to rise to the level of the production price for a while. However, the market is tighter, which is a real phenomenon.

### Huazhong Match Company to be Established on Schedule

The Huazhong Match Company has been prepared and will convene the third initiators meeting soon. At that time, the articles of association and investment relations will be passed, and the directors and supervisors will be elected. Then, a general meeting will be convened on a regular basis. As for the date of the third initiators meeting, it will be decided after Ban Ye Qingmin of the China Branch Revitalization Association returns to office. The general meeting is expected to be held in early March. (Twenty-third Continental Daily)

### The City's Second Rice Sale This Month to Begin Soon: Rationing of Two Sheng per Person

The city's mid-month rice for this month has been fully allocated by the City Food Management Bureau and notified to each public rice market to pay for the rice. Therefore, the city will soon begin selling everywhere in one or two days. Each person is still required to provide two liters per ten days. It is said that the third public rice sale may increase to two and a half liters per ten days, so that the allocation of rice in the city will be more abundant.

### China's Nouveau Riche and Commodity Prices

There is a Japanese saying called "Narikin," which is equivalent to the Chinese expression "baofu renjia" (newly rich family). In the Shanghai and Suzhou areas, it is simply called "baofahu" (nouveau riche).

In Japan, the term "Narikin" carries a sense of contempt, and the same is true in China, where "baofahu" are viewed as base. However, the psychological state of the "baofahu" themselves is clearly different due to the different national conditions of China and Japan. Japanese "Narikin" are very cautious, trying their best to avoid being called "Narikin" by others, so even if they truly become "Narikin," they are unwilling to reveal their "Narikin" status.

However, Chinese "baofahu" do not have this kind of mentality; they do not want to avoid being called "baofahu" by others. Because of this flaw, they are known as "baofahu" to others, and when relatives and friends encounter them, they ask for donations or forcibly borrow money. They are often also targeted for kidnapping, resulting in the sacrifice of huge sums of money, which is their greatest pain. As a result, by the time they want to avoid being called "baofahu," their reputation has spread far and wide, and they have no choice but to acknowledge it. They have no choice but to hire bodyguards to prevent danger, but the more they do so, the greater their reputation as "baofahu" becomes, and the more everyone knows that they are "baofahu." They are very stingy externally, but their private lives are truly unimaginable, indulging in all kinds of luxury. In China, there are not many types of "baofahu," and most of them have become rich through speculation, so they have a strong psychological inclination towards speculation. In fact, their speculative mentality, as we Japanese see it, is simply crude, but perhaps there is a great truth behind it. Perhaps it is more appropriate to say that they are "bold"! They use a very small amount of capital, and once they succeed in speculation, they become extremely wealthy. After obtaining so much cash, they naturally want to find a way to invest it in goods, considering the issue of commodity prices. If they save the cash and do not use it, and commodity prices continue to rise, wouldn't that be a loss? Therefore, they think of hoarding goods, no matter what they are, as long as they have physical goods in hand, they do not worry about any losses. Therefore, those who hoard goods are unwilling to sell them. Even if they make money by selling at the current market price, the cash they receive cannot replace the same amount of goods, so they only buy and do not sell, so that there is no loss. Generally speaking, these two mentalities are the root of becoming rich through speculation. The current rise in commodity prices in Shanghai can be said to be driven by this "speculation-to-riches" mentality. I believe this view is correct.

Changing the mentality of the nouveau riche in theory is one of the strategies for adjusting commodity prices and strengthening combat power. I hope that the rulers of China will consider this. (Yunpeng: Translated from the original work of Kurimoto Toraji in the Mainland New Report of the 23rd of the month)

### "Going in the Open" and "Coming in Secret"

— Junhao

When beggars ask for alms, they often say "going in the open, coming in secret."

In fact, I think this saying has its flaws. Think about it: Giving money to help the hungry and cold is originally a righteous and generous act of kindness. However, some philanthropists are not very willing to let their names be known after giving alms. In other words, if they are willing to give alms only in the hope of being praised for their charity, then it is a bit... From this, it is clear that the phrase "going in the open" is extremely inappropriate.

As for "coming in secret," that is even more wrong. Think about it: How can money be obtained in secret? All money obtained without telling people honestly is either ill-gotten gains, improper gains, or unjust gains. If one earns money fairly and squarely through hard work, then one can tell people without hiding anything, why seek it secretly?

Therefore, the saying "going in the open, coming in secret" should be changed to "coming in the open, going in secret."

### A Sunday of Starvation

— Mo

Since the distribution of rice by household registration, the school authorities, in addition to serving thin rice porridge mixed with sweet potatoes for dinner, have recently introduced a new rule that no meals will be provided at noon on Sundays, because students can go back to their relatives' and friends' homes for a hearty meal. This is originally a win-win situation. The school can save expenses, and the students can take this opportunity to enjoy a delicious meal. (Although commodity prices are high, the food at home is always better than at school.)

At first, I was shocked when I heard this news, because once I ran out of the school gate, I had nowhere to go, so I could rest assured that I would not be met with cold faces from relatives and friends. However, my finances are not very generous, so going to a small restaurant is out of the question. After a long period of consideration, I thought that it was only once a week, and if I didn't eat, I would only be hungry four times a month, and only forty-eight times a year, which was a small matter. It probably wouldn't affect my health, right? So I decided that I would not eat lunch every Sunday.

When I ate rice porridge on Sunday morning, I thought that there would be no meal at noon, so I ate one more bowl than usual. Approximately one bowl of rice porridge can last for two and a half hours without being hungry, so if I can eat four and a half bowls of rice porridge, I can last until the afternoon. What does it matter if I don't eat lunch? However, after eating three bowls, I really couldn't drink any more. Although I knew that I would definitely be hungry later, my stomach really couldn't hold any more.

Experience tells me that people who work too hard are prone to hunger, so after eating rice porridge, in addition to climbing a few flights of stairs from the dining hall to the dormitory, I tried my best to avoid physical activity. There were many people in the same dormitory, and in addition to reading books myself, I also chatted with them. Time always passes quickly in the hustle and bustle, and it disappears unnoticed. I didn't feel hungry at all.

Ding ding... the sound of the church bell ringing at noon came into my ears. I was still sitting calmly, but the students left one after another to enjoy this beautiful Sunday.

Only I was left in the room. In the empty atmosphere, I reflected on the strange emptiness in my stomach. I hurriedly picked up a copy of the Analects and began to hum the words of Confucius. I hadn't finished reading the Xue Er chapter when the sky became dark and it started to rain. If I were a poet, I would definitely use my inspiration to describe this misty rain, but unfortunately I am not, and I am also glad that I am not.

Along with the sound of the rain came the rumbling and commotion in my stomach, and I really couldn't read any more! Staring blankly at the raindrops outside, I gently comforted my stomach. Look, isn't it raining outside? Without an umbrella and rain boots, how can you go out? Isn't it very comfortable to sit at home on a rainy day like this? They must be as soaked as drowned chickens.

My mental comfort did not have any effect. In fact, it needed material assistance. With too much mental and psychological activity, its "deer cry" became even louder than before.

I put down the Analects and picked up Mencius to read. I read from Mencius's visit to King Hui of Liang to "Those who are old wear silk and eat meat, and the common people are not hungry or cold. It has never happened that one who does not do these things can rule the world." My heart was greatly comforted. Didn't Master Mencius tell us that one must be old to wear silk and eat meat, and that only the common people can be free from hunger and cold? It can be seen that young people in their twenties should go hungry. But if someone asks me why there are beggars in their seventies and eighties on the street, I think they are probably begging for silk clothes and meat, or perhaps they are still children and not old enough.

### Bitterness and Joy

— Humin

Bitterness and joy, like frugality and extravagance, do not seem to have clear boundaries.

For a poor person, taking a rickshaw is considered extravagance; for a wealthy person, it is considered frugality, because the cost of taking a rickshaw is a considerable amount in the poor person's total expenditure; in the wealthy person's expenditure, it is a small amount.

Bitterness and joy are also like this. Suppose a poor scholar who has no money and worries about his daily meals will be happy if someone gives him dozens of dollars. Similarly, a wealthy person who is used to using large sums of money will feel that it is difficult to survive and extremely distressed if he only has a few dollars left.

Therefore, only those who have joy and no suffering in their lives do not know joy.

Because bitterness and joy have these characteristics, some people live in suffering without knowing it. Otherwise, people always like to enjoy happiness, so who would be silly enough to endure suffering?

Some people say that I have seen some people who have nothing to be happy about. Why do they willingly endure suffering?

Yes, there are indeed such people in the world, and only these people can be admired. Because they can find some joy in absolute suffering and use this joy to forget their stubborn suffering.

But their joy is not for contentment or for mental abnormality. Because contentment and mental abnormality will cause them to lose their precious future and true joy.

They all believe that joy will definitely follow suffering. Moreover, its arrival seems to be periodic, and it will naturally descend at a certain time. Even if they cannot enjoy it, their children and grandchildren will definitely be able to enjoy it.

However, on the contrary, some people think that they are "idiots looking up at the sky waiting for it to collapse." That kind of theory, that kind of fantasy, is always a theory, a fantasy, and there is no hope of realization.

Therefore, they enter a vortex of only immediate pleasure and no future from suffering that is indeed unbearable. Some people even engage in fratricide and murder direct relatives because they cannot enter this vortex. These people are the truly pitiful creatures who will never obtain true and lasting joy.

There are also some people who resent their suffering after enduring a long period of suffering and cannot wait for the arrival of joy.

The longer one lives a hard life, the longer the joy one will receive in the future.

We can also find a large number of people in novels and history who lived a hard life in their youth and later became people with property and status.

If they do not know how to encourage themselves and improve themselves through hardship, but only complain about heaven and earth and curry favor with the powerful, how can they have such honor and joy one day?

Many old and respected gentlemen have also told us that all true learning, knowledge, and experience are obtained in times of poverty and hardship, which are more extensive and practical than those obtained in times of joy, or rather, in times of wealth.

Therefore, let us treat this period of widespread war and suffering as the only opportunity to encourage us and improve ourselves; on the one hand, let us be more optimistic in this period of suffering and use a spirit of fearlessness to create lasting joy and lasting happiness in the future!

### Elementary School Teachers Under Rising Living Costs

— Written by Tianming

### Life

— Qi Wu

Many people often feel that they are too busy to read a book or complete a long-awaited work. But they also often feel bored and have no place to settle their minds and bodies.

In this contradictory psychological state, they spend their lives, silently and without a trace.

Therefore, as the Western proverb says, "People know that life is limited and short, but they act as if life is permanent and will not die."

### Model Teacher for All Ages

— Written by James Hilton, translated by Yi Jin

Sometimes, when he walked around the school, the older students would also ask him questions, just to have fun and get the "latest stuff" from Gips to sell to others.

"Excuse me, sir, how is the five-year plan going?"

"Sir, do you think Germany will fight another war?"

"Have you been to the new cinema, sir? I went with my family the other day. It's a big thing for a small place like Brookfield. They have a Wmrlitzer."

"What exactly - uh - is - a Wmrlitzer?"

"It's an organ, sir - a cinema organ."

"Oh... I've seen that name at the - uh - cinema, but I've always - uh - suspected - it must be some kind of - uh - sausage."

Laughter. …Oh, this is Gips's new joke, friends, a completely lovely joke. I was talking to the old boy about the new cinema, and so……

In November 1933, one afternoon, he sat in the front room of his room in Mrs. Wiggott's house. It was cold and foggy, and he didn't dare to go out. He hadn't been very well since Armistice Day; he thought he might have caught a slight cold during the service. Mouriefield had come by that morning for his usual fortnightly chat. "Everything's all right, though? Feeling fine? That's right - good to stay indoors in this weather - there's a cold going around. Hope I'll hear your life finished in a day or two."

His life… what a life it was! As he sat by the fire that afternoon, the whole of his life unfolded before him. The things he had done and seen; Cambridge in the 1860s; the big hill one morning in August; Brookfield, at every moment, through all the years. As for life, there were also the things he had not done, and things he had only recently noticed and now would never do - such as he had never flown in an airplane, and he had never seen a talkie. Thus he was in some ways more experienced and in some ways less experienced than the youngest new boy at the school; and this mixture of old and young was what the world called progress. (45)

### Honesty

— Jingtai

In this society of mutual deception, everything we see in human affairs is mostly covered with a coat of deception. And the habits of ordinary people are so easy to tell false words and do false deeds. Therefore, it makes people feel that this world is too ugly.

A person can, at most, be honest with a few close friends and relatives; otherwise, he has to deal with things by means of hypocrisy and deception, depending on the time and place. However, in any case, a person who is honest can always win people's respect and joy; on the contrary, he will arouse people's aversion and contempt.

Honesty is indeed a person's greatest treasure. Because a person is honest, even if his life is poor and his position is humble, his kind of personality beauty will always shine, making people admire him.

How should we define honesty? For example, if a doctor says to a patient who has no hope of life: "You are dying." Is this appropriate? If the doctor says to the patient: "Your illness is getting better, you can rest assured and recuperate." Then, can we criticize the doctor for saying these dishonest words? Of course, in human nature, we all support the doctor using the latter method to comfort the patient. In the complex human society, there are countless such things; therefore, the more appropriate explanation of honesty is: based on the principle of good intentions, the method of expression is not absolute.

The famous Greek philosopher Socrates was mocked by the common people as a madman because he was honest. However, for thousands of years, people have been praising and yearning for this honest madman!

Honesty is truly the most beautiful treasure in life.

When all sounds are quiet, let us ask ourselves: Are we honest with others and with ourselves, in words, deeds, thoughts, and beliefs? Or not? (Excerpt from a speech by Mr. Gu Zhengshu of the Youth Association on February 14)

### Repairing the Mituo Temple Church

(Letter) Last winter, the border between Anhui and Hubei provinces was suddenly hit by war, and the Taihu Mituo Temple area was the first to bear the brunt.

Now, it is planned to slightly repair it as a place for missionaries to live and for church members to worship. In addition to applying for an allocation of funds, I also ask our enthusiastic church members to generously donate to jointly accomplish this great undertaking. Please send donations to Father Wei of the Yangjingbang Catholic Church in Shanghai to be forwarded to Father Yang Di of the Anqing Diocese. Sincerely, Yang Di.

Acknowledgments
