### On the New Situation in East Asia

Among the recent personnel changes in the Japanese cabinet, the most noteworthy is the transfer of Ambassador to China, Mamoru Shigemitsu, to the post of Foreign Minister. This is because the Japanese government is currently the sole center of gravity in promoting the East Asian political situation, and the Japanese Foreign Ministry bears the responsibility for promoting Japan's foreign relations. Therefore, changes in the Foreign Minister position are inherently closely related to the evolution of the East Asian situation.

Since the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, the position of Foreign Minister was initially concurrently held by Prime Minister Tojo, and later by Shigenori Togo. After Togo resigned, it was succeeded by Kazuo Aoki until this current change. Currently, most of the diplomatic affairs within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are handled by the Greater East Asia Ministry, while the jurisdiction of the Foreign Ministry is limited to diplomatic affairs centered around Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union. However, due to general circumstances, the workload of the Foreign Ministry is actually less burdensome than that of the Greater East Asia Ministry. Therefore, the importance of the Foreign Minister position seems to have diminished somewhat compared to before.

However, the fact that the current change in the Japanese Foreign Minister involves the appointment of Ambassador to China, Shigemitsu, who enjoys a reputation as a realistic diplomat, is the point we want to discuss further. At the same time, it is also a key to understanding the new situation in East Asia.

First of all, the question that comes to mind is whether the powers and affairs of the Foreign Minister position will be the same as before after Shigemitsu assumes office. However, observing the various developing situations, it is certain that the powers and affairs will be more extensive than before. Therefore, Shigemitsu's appointment as Foreign Minister gives us a very clear indication: that "the position of Japanese Foreign Minister is no longer as simple and light as it has been in recent times."

From Japan's perspective, the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain, the future of the German-Soviet war, and the various aspects of Japan's foreign relations arising from other world situations, cannot be discussed in great detail here. However, in summary, the Japanese government's diplomacy towards Germany and the Soviet Union will be extremely delicate and important from now on. In particular, diplomacy towards the Soviet Union will naturally involve the United States and Britain, and there will also be close connections with the war on the China and South Pacific fronts, as well as other political matters. Therefore, the Foreign Minister must be familiar with the situation in China, and also understand the political situations in the Soviet Union, Germany, and the United States and Britain. In this complex situation, he must have a calm and accurate judgment of the situations arising from all sides, in order to implement the most realistic diplomatic policies. Under these various requirements, Shigemitsu is undoubtedly the most suitable person. We believe that this is the main reason for the current appointment of Shigemitsu as Foreign Minister.

Secondly, from our country's perspective, based on the reasons mentioned above, Japan's diplomacy towards China now needs to be considered and coordinated in conjunction with its diplomacy towards Germany, the Soviet Union, and other countries. Therefore, the center of gravity of Japan's diplomacy towards China has shifted from Nanjing to Tokyo, and then from Tokyo to the international arena. This understanding is very important and should not be overlooked. In other words, although it is due to objective circumstances, our government's international standing has been enhanced as a result. This is also worth noting.

Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that the Greater East Asia War has already moved from the stage of military operations to a new stage of comprehensive integration of politics, diplomacy, military affairs, and economics. In other words, it is a new stage of comprehensive warfare that is being implemented on the path of past Japanese victories, but in a more complex and sustained manner. And the position of the National Government has further become a more important member of the international community as a result.

We must recognize the new situation in East Asia, actively assist the government, and urge the government to have the ability to shoulder the tasks of this more complex new stage, and assist Japan in completing the victory of the Greater East Asia liberation war.

### Welcoming Ambassador Tani and Farewell to Ambassador Cai

The unfolding of the new situation in East Asia requires closer cooperation between China and Japan, concentrating all the strength of both countries to prepare for the final victory in the future decisive battle and to welcome the dawn of East Asia. The practice of this new mission of China and Japan naturally depends on the joint efforts of the people of both countries, and how both sides can be of one mind, mutually understanding and mutually assisting, to complete the mission, is first of all expected of the authorities of both countries, especially the efforts of the ambassadors of both countries.

Since our country's participation in the war, the friendly relations between China and Japan have developed more favorably. In particular, the transformation of Japan's policy towards China, taking the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions as an opportunity, has moved towards a path of sincere cooperation, mutual assistance, and joint construction of a new order in East Asia that matches the name and the reality. Here, we express our respect for the wisdom and correctness of the national policy of the authorities of the friendly nation's government, as well as the efforts and struggles of former Ambassador to China, Shigemitsu, who recently transferred to Minister of Foreign Affairs. In particular, Shigemitsu's sympathy and care for our nation's liberation movement has left a bright and indelible impression not only in Chinese political circles, but especially among our people. Since Ambassador Shigemitsu's honorable promotion to Foreign Minister, the concern and anticipation of our people for the new ambassador's candidate is no less than that of our government authorities. And today, the good news comes from the east, that the former Foreign Minister, Tani Masayuki, who has long been admired by the government and the public in our country, has been transferred to the Ambassador to China. We truly have a feeling of overwhelming honor.

Ambassador Tani has served in the Japanese diplomatic corps for thirty years, and especially towards our country, has understanding and sympathy. We firmly believe that Ambassador Tani will be able to further strengthen Sino-Japanese cooperation following former Advisor Aoki and Ambassador Shigemitsu, and complete the mission of the Greater East Asia War as soon as possible. He declared that "the Empire, in order to adapt to the new situation, and with the aim of assisting the National Government and strengthening its political power, resolutely implemented the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions. China's long-cherished wish for a century of sovereign integrity has been achieved. The coexistence and co-prosperity of China and Japan has also been on the right track, and there is no need to say more about the thorough implementation of this new policy by our country in the future. This has extremely important significance in building a new order in Greater East Asia. Therefore, the impact of its results on all the ethnic groups in Greater East Asia and even the whole world is truly difficult to estimate." Ambassador Tani further pointed out in response to the current overall situation, "I have received the imperial command this time, and I must take the will of the frontline soldiers as my will, deeply understand the government's policy, and step forward to strengthen Sino-Japanese cooperation." Based on this, it is even more anticipated that Ambassador Tani will strive to promote the overall cooperation between China and Japan in the future, in order to win the final victory of the war. This will definitely have a very significant impact on the future of East Asia.

While welcoming Ambassador Tani's early arrival, our country's new Ambassador to Japan, Cai Pei, has also completed his mission of inspecting the new situation in various aspects after participating in the war in North China and returned to the capital. He will soon cross the sea to take office. In this new era of rapid progress in Sino-Japanese friendly relations, we have the same warm expectations for Ambassador Cai. Ambassador Cai's understanding of the international situation and the position of Japan does not need us to boast about it. We hereby express our words of farewell in advance to his future efforts to promote Sino-Japanese friendly relations. First of all, we hope that Ambassador Cai will reflect more of the actual situation of our people, especially to reflect the emotions and ideals of our people to the Japanese people at any time, so that the combination of the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan is not limited to the war period, but extends to the endless future; not only to the governments or political circles of the two countries, but expands to the people of all levels; not only limited to politics, military affairs, and economy, but permeates culture and society. Because only this kind of practical effort will consolidate the true cooperation between China and Japan, and will take the cooperation between the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan as a model, and further establish the unity of the East Asian countries and establish a new order in East Asia.

The importance of the current situation and the arduousness of the responsibilities borne by China and Japan in this situation can never be described in ordinary words. Therefore, the current stage of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations is by no means comparable to ordinary international relations. In this new sense of shared hardship between China and Japan, the so-called diplomacy has a deeper meaning. Neither side can play its diplomatic tricks from the starting point of selfishness and self-interest like British and American diplomats. What China and Japan urgently need today is no longer the ordinary so-called "harmony between nations" and "compromising and negotiating," nor is it general diplomatic work; what is actually required of the envoys of both sides must be a comprehensive understanding of the international situation and the mission of the two countries, a deep understanding of the integral relationship between China and Japan, and a practical understanding and sympathy for the other side's national policies and requirements. Japan must fully understand the legitimate demands of the Chinese nation for independence and freedom and provide practical assistance, not only focusing on unilateral and temporary interests. China should also thoroughly understand the meaning of the Greater East Asia War and make the greatest efforts to assist Japan. And the envoys of the two countries must make the greatest efforts in this regard, and cooperate closely with the governments of the countries where they are stationed, especially the people of the other side, to overcome all difficulties and pave the way to complete their missions. While sincerely welcoming and sending them off, we hope that the dawn of East Asia will follow the two ambassadors and shine on the entire Pacific region as soon as possible.

Recalling ten years ago, it would have been impossible to attend today's grand ceremony. Seeing the rapid progress made by Japan's aircraft, tanks, artillery, and all kinds of elite weapons in such a short period of time, they felt sincere admiration.

### Foreign Minister Chu Returns to the Capital; Delivers Thoughts on Visiting Japan Before Returning Home

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) - Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, Chu Minyi, who represented our country at the Third East Asia Medical Conference in Japan and presented the Medal of Grand Cordon of T'ung-Yuan from our country to the Emperor of Japan as a special envoy of the National Government, has completed his mission and flew to Shanghai on the 28th. On the afternoon of the 29th, Minister Chu took the Nanjing-Shanghai express train and returned to Nanjing at 9:20 p.m. that evening.

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China, Chu Minyi, delivered his impressions of this trip at the request of Japanese reporters before leaving here on the 28th to return home. The following is a transcript of the main points: "This time I have returned to Tokyo again, almost at the same time. Initially, I came here as a physician, leading the Chinese delegation to attend the East Asia Medical Conference, and planned to discuss the issue of communication between Chinese and Japanese culture with various sectors of the Japanese government and the public from the position of a cultural person. Later, I was ordered by my government to be a special envoy for the presentation of the medal, and was able to present the Medal of Grand Cordon of T'ung-Kuang, which my country presented to His Majesty the Emperor, before the Emperor. Now that the matter has been completed and I am returning home, I would like to briefly express my feelings: During my tenure as Ambassador to Japan, and last year when I visited Japan as a special envoy, and again last winter when I visited with Chairman Wang, I have repeatedly received the preferential treatment of the Japanese royal family and the welcome of the government and the public, and my sincere gratitude cannot be expressed in words. This time, the National Government, in order to repay the sincere assistance of your government over the past three years, presented the Medal of Grand Cordon of T'ung-Kuang to His Majesty the Emperor, in order to express the gratitude of our government. I have once again received the generous treatment of the royal family, which is an unparalleled honor. I was fortunate to attend the second East Asia Medical Conference and meet with representatives from the medical community in various parts of East Asia to express our views on promoting the development of East Asian medicine. I also elaborated on the issue of Tai Chi exercises and health. Such mutual learning and discussion will surely benefit the development of East Asian medicine. Since the introduction of Western medical theory into Japan, in only a few decades, countless Japanese scholars have studied it intensively, analyzed its essence, and strived to popularize it. It has created its own unique style and is shining brightly. It has perfect facilities and comprehensive systems for the treatment of diseases and the health care of the people, which are worthy of China's emulation. During my tenure as Ambassador to Japan, I visited the Imperial University Hospital. This time I had the opportunity to visit the Keio University Hospital, and I deeply admired the perfection of its equipment. In the future, in order to promote the development of Chinese medicine, we must learn from Japan as a reference. Previously in Nanjing, I announced the case of the relic of the skull of Xuanzang, who was a great contributor to the spread and development of Buddhism in China, and the direct introduction of Buddhism into Japan began in the Tang Dynasty, so Xuanzang also made great contributions to the spread of Buddhism in Japan. This time, I unintentionally discovered his skull relic in Nanjing, and I plan to build a pagoda so that it can be passed down for a long time. Therefore, I held a tea party to invite people from Buddhist and cultural circles to jointly celebrate the event. Fortunately, I received the enthusiastic support of Japanese people, and in the future, when the bone pagoda is completed, it will be admired by Buddhist believers from both China and Japan, and it will also be a symbol of Buddhist exchanges between the two countries. Buddhism was widely spread due to the introduction of Xuanzang, and the scriptures he translated have made great contributions to Chinese Buddhism. Later, Buddhism flowed into Japan, and many more schools of thought were formed, which became even more brilliant and had a great influence on Japanese culture. In the future, in order to further develop Buddhism in China and Japan, it is necessary for Buddhist believers in both countries to cooperate. This time, I also participated in the grand ceremony of worshiping Confucius at the Yushima Seido. Confucianism has been circulating in Japan for a long time, and the systematic introduction and transmission began in the Tang Dynasty, which has had a great influence on Japanese politics, education, culture, and ethics. To this day, Japanese people still respect Confucius. Since the last few decades, China has accepted Western culture in its entirety, without selecting foreign theories, without digesting them, and accepting them unconditionally. It regards Confucianism as rubbish, and even regards Confucianism as a bandit. As a result, Buddhist concepts and social order have been greatly disrupted, and the central ideas of the past have also been fundamentally overthrown, creating today's situation of ideological confusion. In the future, if we want to rebuild the new order in East Asia, we should take Confucianism as the central idea and further promote the spirit of morality. Recently, the National Government has stipulated that Confucianism should be held in the spring and autumn festivals in a grand manner, and this is also the reason. This time I have been in Japan for more than ten days. Initially, I came here as an engineer and had a lot of contact with various parties. What I admire deeply is the tempering of the spirit and the firmness of determination of the Japanese people from top to bottom. They are working hard and tirelessly in their respective positions, which is enough to guarantee victory. Since its participation in the war, the National Government has had a firm determination to defeat the United States and Britain, and is determined to do everything in its power to work hand in hand with Japan to achieve the completion of the war. This time I have witnessed the strength and tenacity of the Japanese national spirit, the intensity of work, and especially the firm confidence in the war, and I am deeply moved. When I return home this time, I will convey the enthusiasm and determination of the Japanese people to my people, so that they can be more vigorous and more diligent in order to achieve the purpose of the war. Regarding Sino-Japanese cooperation, I have had sincere discussions with various Japanese officials. Japan's new policy towards China has now entered the stage of practice from theory. Recently, the Japanese government resolutely and voluntarily returned the concessions and abolished extraterritorial rights, so that China can develop independently, and our country is sincerely grateful from top to bottom. In the future, we must work harder to implement this policy. At the same time, China must also work harder to seek its revival, so that it can have sufficient strength to share the responsibility of building a new order in East Asia.

### Special Envoy Zhou Discusses Impressions of Visiting Manchukuo

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – Zhou Fohai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, was ordered to visit Manchukuo. He departed from Nanjing on April 8th, arriving in Manchukuo via Dalian. After inspecting the region for eight consecutive days, he returned to Dalian and Lushun for two days of sightseeing before heading to Beiping on the 19th. After a few days stay, he returned to Nanjing on the 25th. As Special Envoy Zhou has already completed his important task, reporters rushed to interview him to ask about his impressions of the trip. He replied as follows: "During my visit to Manchukuo, I received much assistance from all levels of government and society in Manchukuo, as well as from the Kwantung Army, which allowed me to complete my mission. Upon arriving in Dalian, I was warmly received by the Governor of Kwantung Leased Territory, who showed me around Dalian and the historical sites of Lushun. I will never forget this kindness, and I will convey it to my countrymen, in order to strengthen the East Asian axis. The purpose of my trip was to promote friendship between China and Manchukuo and to observe the construction of Manchukuo. After arriving in Manchukuo, I was able to engage in candid discussions with wise men from all sectors of Manchukuo society and inspect the new [areas missing] of Jilin, Harbin, Fengtian, Fushun, Anshan, etc. I learned deeply of the determination of the Manchukuo authorities to strive for victory in the war and their belief in building East Asia, which is completely in line with our own. The rapid progress in various construction projects was especially beyond my expectations. We deeply admire the authorities' meticulous management on the one hand, and on the other hand, we increasingly recognize the urgent need for our country to develop industry. At a time when Japan and Manchukuo are jointly protecting the northern border, and China and Japan are united in waging war, China shoulders extremely important responsibilities and tasks. I hope that the people of the country will be of one heart and one mind, work hard and forge ahead, and strive for economic construction, so that internal unity and external freedom and equality can be realized at an early date."

### Lin Xuanchang Encourages Youth on the Fifth of May Youth Day

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – Secretary-General Lin of the New National Movement Promotion Committee released a statement on the Fifth of May Youth Day. The full text is as follows:

At the time of the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital and the first general review of the China Youth Corps, comrades from various regions suggested designating a Youth Day, which was a very good idea. I reported this to the Leader, who graciously approved it. The Supreme National Defense Council resolved today to designate May 5th of each year as Youth Day. On the occasion of the first Youth Day, I would like to share the following five points with my fellow young comrades:

(1) April 4th is Children's Day, June 6th is Teachers' Day, and May 5th is the anniversary of the Father of the Nation's inauguration as President (National Day of the Republic of China, Double Tenth Day in the 10th year of the Republic of China). The fact that we are now designating May 5th as Youth Day is not a coincidence, and it has a profound meaning. On this day, we should recognize the difficult creation of the Republic of China, and especially deeply recognize the spirit of the Father of the Nation's leadership of the youth over the years, continuing the revolution, advancing wave upon wave, and fighting against reactionary forces. The Double Tenth Day of ten years ago relies on the Double Fifth of ten years later to regain its glory; the Double Fifth of [22] years later should inherit the revolutionary spirit of the Double Fifth of [22] years ago; so that the Double Tenth Day in the future will forever be a glorious and brilliant National Day anniversary of the Republic of China.

(2) Completing the Greater East Asia War is the primary task at hand, and it is also the most important step in revitalizing China and defending East Asia. The rise and fall of a nation depends on the spirit and strength of its youth; the victory or defeat of a war also depends on the strength of its youth. At a time when the Greater East Asia War is unfolding victoriously, the friendly relations between China and Japan are growing day by day, and China, after years of disaster, has finally struggled to break free from the shackles of a century of aggression, we are holding the first Youth Day. All my young comrades must refine themselves, strive forward, and concentrate all their spirit and strength to seek the completion of the war. By cultivating one's own spirit and strength, enriching the spirit and strength of the youth of the whole country, and then uniting the spirit and strength of the youth of East Asia, we can ensure that our spirit and strength are always and everywhere sufficient to overcome the spirit and strength of the enemy, crush the enemy, and strive for victory. The future of China and the future of East Asia depend on this.

(3) The purpose of designating Youth Day is to enable the youth of the whole country to raise their vigor of courage and diligence, and endurance once a year. On this day each year, we should review the work of the past, recognize the importance of our responsibilities, and in deep reflection and self-criticism, stimulate our efforts for the year ahead.

(4) The Leader advocates the New National Movement in order to establish oneself, urging the people of the country, and making them certain that everyone can establish themselves, so that they may contribute to the establishment of the nation; and it is certain that China can establish itself, so that it may contribute to the establishment of East Asia. My young comrades follow the Leader's instructions, and should use these four words as the motto of the New National Movement. Every Youth Day, we should use this as a benchmark to review the past and plan for the future, everywhere giving play to the spirit of establishing oneself, and constantly enriching this spirit.

(5) China's youth movement has had a vigorous development, but it has been either empty and scattered, starting with frivolity and then declining, or divided into factions, [attacking each other], as a result, the knowledge and abilities of individuals have not been enriched, the strength of the collective has not been given play, and the nation and even the overall situation in East Asia has suffered. In the future, we should use Youth Day as a symbol of the youth of the whole country's unified belief and unified action, consolidate its unity and increase its strength, in order to save China and protect East Asia.

### Guangzhou Allows Free Import of Rice

Guangzhou, 29th Because the source of rice is scarce, in order to increase imports, merchants and farmers are temporarily allowed to freely import rice into the city to supplement the supply. Since the announcement has been made known to all, farmers in the suburbs with stored grain and residents in the city with surplus grain have continuously imported large quantities into the city for sale and for their own use since the 25th, so the source of rice in the city has suddenly become abundant in recent days.

### Close Liaison Between London and Washington Attempts to Reconcile Soviet-Polish Relations; British Policy Shows a Tendency to Accommodate Moscow; Sikorski Government May Undergo Reorganization

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) – The diplomatic correspondent for the London Daily Mail reported this morning that British Prime Minister Churchill discussed the severance of relations between the Soviet and Polish governments with President Roosevelt by telephone, which shows the concerns caused by the note sent by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to Sikorski. Washington has adopted an extremely reserved attitude towards this crisis. However, the US Minister to Poland, Biddle, has recently held several talks with the Polish Prime Minister. Political observers in Washington believe that this indicates that the United States is engaging in active diplomacy regarding this matter.

Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports: News received from London clearly shows that British policy tends to completely abandon the Polish government-in-exile in London in order to accommodate Moscow. Since British newspapers suggested on Tuesday that the Polish government be reorganized to restore Soviet-Polish relations, sympathy for the current Polish government in London has clearly reached zero this morning. Political circles believe that the reason for this development is that Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky has assured Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Secretary Eden that the Soviet government will never abandon its current position, no matter what. Those who still hope to obtain some kind of agreement are anticipating that the Polish government will resign and be replaced by a government organized by non-anti-Soviet elements. Therefore, in the past 24 hours, the British opposition to the Sikorski government has become increasingly important. The London Times yesterday symbolized the main principles of British policy towards the Soviet-Polish conflict, saying that Churchill and Eden fully understand that the closest trust is needed between Britain and the Soviet Union, which is truly commendable. Political circles inferred from this sentence that the British government will notify the Polish government that, in order to achieve close understanding between London and Moscow, the British government will no longer be able to assist the Polish government. Reuters also commented on this issue, using all the arguments of the Soviet government, even saying that the Red Army has made great contributions to the liberation of Poland, without taking into account the Soviet Union's claims to all of Poland's land. Reuters also criticized the Polish government for allowing its newspapers to constantly irritate the Soviet Union regarding future border issues, and said that the authors of these articles were irresponsible and that the Polish government did not prevent the publication of these articles.

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, the Soviet Union had long established a Polish Communist Committee, originally hoping to use it to oppose the Polish government-in-exile in London. The time for this has now clearly arrived, and this is the main method used by the Soviet government to exert pressure on Britain after severing relations with the Polish government. Washington's hope that Soviet-Polish relations are only suspended rather than severed is wishful thinking. This can be confirmed by the wording of the English note sent by Moscow to the Polish leaders. London is trying to require Poland to reorganize its government in the hope of finding a solution. But in this case, Poland may have three governments, one in Moscow, one in London, and Sikorski's government will establish its headquarters elsewhere. But in any case, Britain will never allow its European policy to continue to be incomplete, nor will it allow its ties with Moscow to be threatened.

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to reliable sources, the Soviet government has repeatedly planned to gather the Committee of Polish Communist Immigrants residing in the Soviet Union in order to overthrow the Polish government led by Sikorski. Taking advantage of the worsening Soviet-Polish relations, it immediately established the committee. It is also learned that the committee has decided to send Commissioner Vasilyev, a female writer, to London to carry out activities.

Rome, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Fascist newspaper stated yesterday that General Sikorski has decided to move the Polish government-in-exile to Washington. It is understood that this move will only be realized when Britain recognizes the new pro-Soviet Polish government that is rumored to be in the process of being organized.

### Proclamation Issued by Polish Government: Refutes Accusations by Soviet Union

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency): According to sources in London, the Polish government-in-exile in London issued a proclamation last night refuting Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's claims that Sikorski was cooperating with Germany and hinting that the Polish government was willing to resume normal relations with the Soviet Union under certain conditions. According to diplomatic correspondents of Reuters, if the Soviet government begins to address the issue of repatriating Polish women, children, and former soldiers still in the Soviet Union, the Polish government is prepared to no longer treat the matter of missing Polish officers as a political issue. The proclamation's content was unanimously approved at a special meeting of the Polish government last night. Its wording was carefully considered as an indirect response to the Soviet Union's declaration of severance of relations. It is nominally announced to the world through newspapers and will be delivered to the Soviet government through newspapers, just as the Soviet declaration was delivered to the Polish government through newspapers.  The Soviet declaration to the Polish ambassador in the Soviet Union accused the Polish government of colluding with Germany and refusing to accept it. According to the Polish side, the content of the declaration was an active proposal for reconciliation between the Soviet Union and Poland. The proclamation deliberately avoided mentioning the Polish government's request for the International Red Cross to investigate Germany's accusation that the Soviet Union massacred 12,000 Polish officers near Smolensk in 1940. Reuters correspondents believe that this matter is now completely dead. The Polish proclamation also did not mention the Soviet Union's severance of relations, implying that if the Soviet government responds to Poland's demands regarding Poles remaining in the Soviet Union, the severance of relations will be considered a thing of the past. The Polish declaration, as previously expected, refuted the Soviet Union's accusations that the Polish government was cooperating with Germany and denied any territorial claims against the Soviet Union. A Reuters reporter stated, "This proclamation will clearly disappoint those who expected the Polish government to suddenly change its stance." It is not yet known how the Soviet government will react, but the British and American governments will continue their joint efforts in London, Washington, and Moscow to reconcile the two countries. The original text of the Polish government's proclamation has been telegraphed to its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Romer.

### British Government Exerts Pressure on Poland: Easing the Crisis of Division Among Allied Nations

Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Central News Agency): The British government convened an emergency cabinet meeting on the 27th of this month to discuss countermeasures against the deteriorating Soviet-Polish relations. The following day, Churchill and Eden met with Polish government-in-exile Prime Minister Sikorski and Foreign Minister Raczynski to negotiate. The British government has consistently advocated contacting the US government to restrain the Polish government-in-exile in order to ease the crisis among the anti-Axis nations. According to well-informed sources, the British government seems to be attempting to (1) reorganize the Polish government-in-exile and further urge Sikorski to step down; (2) have the Polish government-in-exile withdraw its application to the Geneva International Red Cross to investigate the truth about the massacre of soldiers; and (3) have Poland abandon its claims to recover lost territories, etc., in order to suppress the Polish government-in-exile. Furthermore, all British newspapers on the 27th unanimously reported, pointing out that the Polish government-in-exile had been deceived by German propaganda. In order to prevent the Soviet government from being incited by various countries' remarks, the British government instructed its newspapers to exercise self-restraint and carefully review the news from foreign correspondents in Britain. The Polish government-in-exile originally intended to issue a strong resolution after the cabinet meeting on the 27th, but it was not issued that day. Only a spokesperson stated that a new situation had arisen. A statement was not issued until the night of the 28th, but the statement was extremely weak, completely different from the previous attitude of the Polish government-in-exile. The main points of the statement were: (1) to request the Soviet government to grant freedom to Polish nationals residing in Soviet territory, especially the young men of conscription age, as they are absolutely necessary to strengthen the Polish military's combat power; (2) the Polish government has always been committed to protecting the integrity of the Polish Republic, but has not made any territorial claims against the Soviet Union; (3) the Polish government earnestly hopes to have friendly understanding with the Soviet Union. Regarding the Katyn Forest incident, a note has been submitted to the Soviet ambassador, but no response has been received.

### Heavy Fighting Continues in Tunisia: Axis Positions Largely Unchanged

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency): A military correspondent of the Havas News Agency reports: The anti-Axis forces in Tunisia have not yet completed their large-scale movements since they began on Monday. The main force of the British Eighth Army, defending its positions, appears to be gradually moving to the left flank. The enemy encountered strong resistance from the Axis forces when advancing towards Pont du Fahs from the Djebel Garci area. Furthermore, the British First Army's large concentration point in the Djebel Ang and Djebel Mansour areas has also received substantial reinforcements from the British Eighth Army, and still appears to be planning to break through the Axis positions. At the same time, General Anderson is currently conducting local attacks to improve his positions before launching his offensive, his main objective seeming to be to capture Pont du Fahs. French rebel forces gradually advanced to the northeastern border of Djebel Mansour over the weekend and launched a fierce attack on the city on Tuesday, but this offensive was blocked to the southwest of the city. Although the French rebel forces suffered considerable losses, they resumed their efforts yesterday morning. After gaining a foothold north of the Kourzia Lake, British tank units are clearly attempting to support the infantry's advance. The pressure from the anti-Axis forces here remains quite strong, with fierce offensives following one after another. North of Medjez el Bab, British forces have captured the small village of Sidi Nsir after fierce fighting, but Djebel Ahmera is still in Axis hands. US forces operating in the north made only insignificant gains yesterday. In the coastal area east of Cape Serrat, Axis forces are still engaged in fierce fighting with French rebel forces.

### Italian King Inspects Bombing Zone

Rome, 29th (Central News Agency): Stefani Agency reports, according to official honesty, the recent air raid on Grottaglie resulted in a total of 145 deaths and 268 injuries, of which 100 were slightly injured and did not require treatment. The majority of the dead and injured were women and children, who were injured and killed by British and American pilots firing machine guns from low altitude. The Italian Emperor arrived in the city yesterday accompanied by his adjutant to inspect the disaster area and personally comforted the injured, then visited the families of the victims to express his condolences.

### Current Affairs Selection and Translation: The Aftermath of the Soviet-Polish Incident

This article describes the discord within the anti-Axis group caused by the Soviet-Polish incident. The Soviet government has already, on April 26, through Foreign Minister Molotov's note to Polish Ambassador Romer, announced the Soviet government's severance of diplomatic relations with the Polish government. This action further exposes the deepening rifts between the anti-Axis nations and puts Britain and the United States in a difficult position.

Unexpectedly, in the forests near Smolensk on the German-Soviet front, German forces discovered the corpses of over 10,000 Polish officers. After the German authorities announced that they were murdered by the Soviet GPU, they appealed to the International Red Cross to investigate, so that an international investigation could clarify the truth to the world. The nature of this case is a tragic event unprecedented in human history. At the same time, with this case as the center, it has exposed new flaws in the disrupted anti-Axis camp, which cannot but attract attention.

What sufficiently proves the German side's announcement is the statement on this case presented by the Polish government-in-exile, one wing of the anti-Axis camp. However, on the Soviet side, they have also come out to deny the German side's announcement, and at the same time accused Poland of being a traitor supporting Germany, vehemently criticizing the Polish government-in-exile.

The truth of this strange incident, rare in international law and in the history of human civilization, should naturally await the fair investigation results of neutral country experts dispatched by the International Red Cross. However, in the currently complex international environment, the International Red Cross, which has always adopted an extremely cautious attitude, finally accepted this issue. Just looking at this fact, one can see the profound and subtle nature of this case.

In short, the fallout from this case has not only brought Soviet-Polish relations to the brink of danger, but also created new rifts in the relations between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States, who have placed the Polish government-in-exile and a series of other governments-in-exile in London and assumed the role of protector. This cannot be easily overlooked.

In 1941, when the German-Soviet war broke out, the Soviet Union changed its previously hostile attitude towards Poland and embraced and supported the Polish nation, which is also a Slavic nation, in accordance with the new policy of uniting all Slavic nations to form a war of nationalities against the German nation. The Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile, Sikorski, visited the Soviet Union two or three times in succession, and even concluded a Soviet-Polish alliance. Who knew that this time, due to the Polish government-in-exile's demand for the recovery of lost territories and the Soviet Union's insistence on maintaining the pre-German-Soviet war borders, the disparity in their views was exposed, and Soviet-Polish relations fell into opposition. This has caused cracks in the Soviet Union's declared great solidarity of the Slavic nations, and its impact on other Slavic nations is naturally significant. However, what is particularly significant is that this Soviet-Polish dispute has directly developed into a dispute between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States, who are backing the Polish government-in-exile, realistically exposing the inconsistency in the anti-Axis camp. Just as this dispute was about to end inconclusively due to the meddling of Britain and the United States, unexpectedly the tragic case of the massacre of over 10,000 Polish officers has now been newly discovered. This issue has not only brought Soviet-Polish relations to the brink of danger, but has also cast a shadow on the relations between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States. Although the unclear attitude of Britain and the United States towards this strange case cannot be known, it is feared that due to this case, what will be presented is either a more chaotic pace between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States, or that Britain and the United States, who are peddling "humanitarianism," will remove their masks as a result.

### After Defeats in India and Burma, the Enemy Voices Blame and Justification

In the great annihilation battle unfolding in the Arakan foothills of western Burma, the Japanese army, with its ingenious tactics and strategies, arranged encircling iron rings, creating a great victory that annihilated three brigades of the enemy British-Indian army. According to reports, the Times, the Chronicle, and other newspapers in London, the enemy capital, are all shouting "planned retreat" and describing the causes of the defeat and future operational trends in a rather interesting way. On the other hand, India's "Statesman" published an editorial entitled "Please Publicize the Truth of This Defeat," attacking the authorities and exposing all sorts of chaotic and contradictory ugly situations.

Reasons for the Defeat

(1) Difficult Supply: The Arakan area has many jungles, swamps, riverbanks, etc., crisscrossing each other, and the roads and bridges are incomplete, resulting in difficult supply and extreme shortages of food and ammunition. Conversely, the Japanese army controls the mouth of the Ma Yu River, and can transport supplies leisurely from Akyab to Taung Bazaar, Rathedaung.

(2) Lack of Naval Control in the Bay of Bengal and Lack of Ships: Seizing Akyab should have been carried out in coordination with the attack on Rangoon, because seizing Rangoon is the most convenient path to seizing Burma. However, the recapture of the Andaman Islands and the securing of naval control in the Bay of Bengal could not be realized due to the lack of ships caused by the North African operations.

(3) Excellent Japanese Military Technology: The Japanese army builds fortifications on high ground, digs many solid trenches, does not accept the British army's counterattacks, and its ability to camouflage and conceal is truly ingenious, causing the British army to miscalculate the Japanese army's strength time and time again. Especially frightening is the Japanese army's flanking maneuver, which often appears unexpectedly, beyond the British army's expectations: to avoid the threat of the flank, the British army makes successive retreats.

(4) Inability to Use Mechanized Weapons: The terrain there is not suitable for the use of the mechanized weapons that the British army is good at, especially the use of tanks, which is completely impossible.

(1) It has explored the Japanese army's defenses in Burma.

(2) It has been able to neutralize the value of the attack base Akyab.

(3) In this operation, the British army has gained valuable practical experience in jungle warfare.

(4) It has attracted the main force of the Japanese army in Burma and the Japanese air force in the southwestern Pacific to Arakan, and has reduced the Japanese pressure on Chongqing and Australia.

Future British Military Operations

This operation is very similar to the Burmese War of 1824. After the British army crossed the Naf River and occupied Maungdaw, it divided its forces into two teams, one south and one from Buthidaung towards Rathedaung, in coordination with the southern army, so as to seize Akyab from both sides. However, due to the Japanese army's meticulous defense, it was cleverly encircled by infiltration tactics. However, this retreat is actually a "planned retreat" before the monsoon is about to arrive. A large-scale attack will be launched again at the beginning of next year, but now it is in a state of inability to carry it out.

Regarding the recent defeat and the issue of India, the Indian English newspaper "Statesman" specifically published an editorial urging the authorities to publicize the truth. This provides a good opportunity for members of the National Congress, who oppose using India as a base of operations and oppose making India bear the war expenses for the Burmese operations, to attack the government. On the one hand, the British army's defeat this time has also caused Chongqing, which is dreaming of opening the Burma Road and sending troops to India from afar, to lose all its energy to arrange a common front in frustration.

### A Link in the Tokyo-Syonan Railway: Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Reopens After Seven Years

(Hangzhou, April 25th, Correspondent Iwabata) The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, linking Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang Province, and the key point of Jinhua, has reopened after seven years since the China Incident, and has returned to its original state. The 176-kilometer railway between Jinhua and the Jingjiang River bank was celebrated with a grand opening ceremony in Jinhua on April 25th. From that day on, general business will be opened. The construction of the line, from the start, only took six months to complete, creating a new record in the history of world railway construction. Under wartime conditions, its speed is comparable to that of Japanese railways.

This railway was originally built in September of the 26th year of the Republic (1937) by Zhang Jingjiang, the then chairman of Zhejiang Province. It started from Xixing in Xiaoshan County on the opposite bank of Hangzhou, passed through Jinhua, Yushan, and then to Nanchang and Pingxiang, forming a winding 600-kilometer railway. Later, due to the outbreak of the China Incident, when Chiang Kai-shek's troops could not withstand the Japanese army's fierce attacks and fled, they blew up the Qiantang River iron bridge and thoroughly destroyed the railway. In the 31st year of the Republic (1942), due to the Zhejiang East and Zhejiang-Jiangxi operations, after the Japanese army secured the area, considering the importance of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, they decided to repair it immediately. Therefore, on May 28th, during the operation, the Huazhong Railway Company was ordered to organize a survey team and began the first step of "building while fighting." At that time, there was heavy rain in the area for days, and the survey team was engaged in turbid currents up to their chests every day. Then, the work team began to swing their sharp hoes on the completely flood-destroyed roadbed and lay the rails abandoned by the enemy.

The operation started in October. Thanks to the tireless efforts of the work team, the 134-kilometer section from Jinhua to Meichi was first repaired on December 13th, and a light train was opened. From April 1st of this year, general business has already begun. The remaining 42-kilometer section from Meichi to the Jingjiang River bank was completed on April 24th, even in the daily rain. On that day, a heavy train was tested on the 176-kilometer railway linking Jinhua to the Jingjiang River bank on the opposite bank of Hangzhou. The cost of the construction, the first and second phases totaling 〇〇〇 million yen, used workers and coolies, up to 14,000 people on the busiest days, averaging 6,000 people per day.

The restoration of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line has significant political and economic significance. Although they belong to Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou and Ningbo, and the inland areas of southern Zhejiang, differ greatly in population and cultural level. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi line will be a pioneer in developing the culture of the area. Also, in today's wartime, the strategic significance of this railway is naturally great, but even more important is its mission to develop the resource-rich Zhejiang-Jiangxi region. The area is rich in wartime-essential mineral resources such as fluorite and tungsten, and agricultural and forestry products are also abundant.

The Zhejiang-Jiangxi line is the artery for developing these resources, and also the trunk connecting Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places with the exchange of goods in the interior. After the first phase of the railway was completed in Jinhua and Lanxi, quite a few residents have returned, and the outflow of goods has gradually increased. The railway runs parallel to the Qiantang River, which can promote the exchange of local materials with Shanghai and Hangzhou. Also, the construction of the Qiantang River iron bridge is scheduled to be completed in the near future, and on the other hand, the engineering in Jinhua and Koukoukai is also being accelerated. Once these projects are completed, the resource-rich Zhejiang-Jiangxi region will assume a major role in the construction of the new China, which is particularly noteworthy. At the same time, the line will become a link to quickly complete the Tokyo-Syonan Greater East Asia Railway, and its glorious development day is also highly anticipated.

### General Registration of Major Items: Extension Granted for Ten Days, from May 1st to 10th

In order to implement the regulations regarding the production, preservation, movement, and distribution of materials, and to carry out the tasks of implementing wartime economic policies and material control guidance and supervision, the Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau has organized the General Registration of Major Items in Shanghai Special City. The registration period was originally from April 5th to April 30th. Now, according to the submissions from various trade associations, members have not been able to complete the registration procedures on schedule, and have requested an extension of the deadline. It is known that the bureau, after learning of the submissions, has granted an extension of ten days out of consideration, from May 1st to 10th. After the deadline, there will be no further extensions. It is hoped that those who store important items will follow the instructions before May 10th and not make mistakes again.

### Per Capita Oil Distribution Period: Not Yet Decided

It is heard that the edible oil wholesalers have been allocated a large amount of soybean oil, which will be sold on the basis of housing tax tickets, but the price will be handled according to the newly revised regulations. Although the oil purchase certificates have been issued by the authorities for the per capita oil distribution issue, the actual implementation period has not yet been decided.

### Police Station Temporarily Does Not Accept Applications for Citizenship from International Residents: Applications Submitted Before February 18th May Be Forwarded to the Ministry of Interior for Approval

Regarding international residents, regardless of whether they are male or female, who naturalize as Chinese, they must first go to the local police station to apply for citizenship, and then forward their application to the Ministry of Interior for review. Only after passing the approval can a nationality certificate be issued. It is now known that the Shanghai Police Station has been ordered to open the procedures for foreign residents and stateless residents who applied to the bureau for naturalization as Chinese before February 18th of this year, and their applications may be forwarded to the Ministry of Interior for approval. Other applications will not be accepted for the time being, but special circumstances are not subject to this rule.

### Permits Required for Moving Nitre and Sulfur in the City

Nitre and sulfur are dangerous goods. A little carelessness can easily cause explosions and great harm. In order to prevent smuggling, the Nitre and Sulfur Bureau specially sent a letter to the Police Headquarters yesterday, asking them to instruct their branches that the movement of nitre and sulfur in the future must have a permit to be transported. Otherwise, it is requested that the police at each post assist in cracking down at any time in order to prevent abuses and avoid danger.

### First Phase of Epidemic Prevention Campaign: One Million People Inoculated, Second Phase to Begin Soon: Check Inoculation Certificates First

The first phase of the city-wide epidemic prevention campaign began on April 16th, and 930,000 people have been inoculated. It is estimated that 600,000 people in the two concessions and 330,000 people in the city. The second phase of inoculation is about to begin. However, before the second phase is launched, people who should have been inoculated in the first phase but have not yet been inoculated must go to the nearest health center or inoculation center for inoculation as soon as possible. Otherwise, the health and baojia authorities will check inoculation certificates within a few days, and those who deliberately evade inoculation will be dealt with in an appropriate manner.

Inoculation in Each Lianbao District

Within the first week of the first phase of the inoculation campaign, the Public Concession Health Department inoculated 73,706 people. During the same period, the number of inoculations by the baojia health teams in each lianbao district was even higher, with the Xinza and Chengdu districts alone reaching a scale of 56,000 people. The epidemic prevention campaign in the French Concession began on April 12th, and more than 153,000 people have been inoculated to date. And the number of inoculation teams will soon increase from 15 to 21 teams, because at least 10,000 people apply for inoculation every day.

Forced Inoculation in Northern Zhabei Starting Today

The first phase of inoculation in the area north of the Suzhou Creek has not yet reached the level of universal coverage. Therefore, the health authorities have decided to start forced inoculation from today for a period of one week. During this period, baojia personnel will go door-to-door to investigate, and if they find anyone who has not been inoculated, they will enforce inoculation. It is found that 465,000 people have been inoculated in the area north of the Suzhou Creek from April 16th to 26th, but there are still 200,000 people who have not been inoculated. Therefore, the baojia authorities decided in advance to implement forced inoculation for one week starting today.

United Baojia Inoculation in Western Shanghai

Since the beginning of the inoculation, the Shanghai West Epidemic Prevention Headquarters has actively dispatched teams to inoculate at the designated eight important intersections, with an average of about 10,000 people per day. As for the headquarters' mobile inoculation, upon request from community organizations, factories, and schools in the area, doctors are dispatched daily to the Shanghai West Headquarters to popularize the inoculation. In the future, inoculation will be carried out jointly with the various lianbao districts.

### Starting Tomorrow, Street Cleaning; Neighborhood Chiefs Have Ordered All Households to Prepare

The Public Concession has decided to launch a large-scale street cleaning campaign starting tomorrow (the 1st). The neighborhood self-governance organizations in each district were notified yesterday to prepare for cooperation. Neighborhood chiefs have already informed all households and requested them to prepare in advance.

Three Purposes of Street Cleaning

The main purposes of the Public Works Department's initiative to launch the street cleaning campaign are three: (1) To promote street cleanliness, in order to fulfill the long-held aspiration of tidying up the city's appearance. (2) To maintain public health, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of epidemic prevention campaigns. (3) To ensure public safety, in order to prevent dangerous incidents (such as the collapse of buildings, and the blowing down of advertising signs by the wind, causing injury to pedestrians, etc.) from occurring.

Commonly Uphold Public Morality and Abandon Bad Habits

From tomorrow until the 7th (Saturday), within this week, the sidewalks of all roads and alleys will be the responsibility of the households facing them to keep clean. As for the pillars, poles, trees, and street lights, water faucets, etc., planted on the roads, they must also be scrubbed clean. Advertising postings along the roads that are detrimental to the appearance of the city will be ordered by the authorities to be cleaned up by laborers. At the same time, the authorities also hope that the public will henceforth commonly uphold public morality, and automatically abandon bad habits such as spitting or urinating indiscriminately, as well as arbitrarily discarding waste paper and fruit peels, and indiscriminate posting of advertisements or propaganda papers, etc.

### Tram Stop on Jing'an Temple Road at Chengdu Road - Effective Tomorrow

Jing'an Temple Road in the Public Concession runs east-west and is a main artery for tram transportation. However, the distance between Mohawk Road and Carter Road is quite far, and there has never been a stop, which has caused inconvenience to passengers. Although eastbound vehicles stop at the west end of the Jockey Club, it is very close to the Carter Road stop, which seems superfluous. The Shanghai Tram Company, in view of this, has decided to set up a stop at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Chengdu Road starting tomorrow, so that passengers on Route 1, Route 2, and Route 12 vehicles can board and alight there. The stop at the west end of the Jockey Club has been announced for cancellation.

### The Urban Fresh Meat Industry Should Still Pay Business Tax

Orders have been issued to the revenue collection offices in each district under the bureau to comply and implement accordingly.

### Sports: Chinese Mixed Team Draws with St. Friend; Each Scores One Goal, Sharing the Glory; Mixed Team to Go North on May 4th

The Shanghai Chinese Mixed Team, in order to go on an expedition to North China, met the St. Friend team at the Xuhui Middle School field at 5:00 PM yesterday. The audience flocked to the field. The referee was He Chunhui, the linesmen were Zhang Le and Chen Jixiang. The Chinese Mixed Team's goalkeeper was Liu Xianhan, the defenders were Li Tiansheng and Li Ning, the center-backs were Song Lingsheng, Qu Yongfu, and Zheng Yingquan, and the forwards were Dai Guayin in the center, with Li Yichen and Han Longhai on the left and right, and Jia Youliang on the right wing and Wu Qixiang on the left wing. The lineup was exceptionally neat. The St. Friend team, due to the absence of Greenberg, Cairo, Ivanov, and others, replaced them with new players Legrin, Huntsson, and Strongson. Everyone expected the Chinese Mixed Team to easily defeat them. However, after the match began, the Chinese Mixed Team felt out of place due to the small field and slippery ground. The match remained a stalemate until the 13th minute when St. Friend scored the first goal in the restricted area, leading 1-0. The Chinese Mixed Team launched a counterattack, with many good shooting opportunities, but due to bad luck with the ball, Wu Qixiang launched an attack from the side in the 25th minute and passed the ball to the center. Unfortunately, Li Yichen held the incoming ball, seized a moment to exploit the gap, and kicked low, shooting into the center of the goal, tying the score at 1-1. The first half ended 1-1, with the outcome undecided. After changing sides, Zhang Lin, Geng Youren replaced Li Tiansheng, Li Ning, the rest remained unchanged. The Chinese Mixed Team's attack was greatly intensified. Li Yichen and Dai had several shooting opportunities, but all were unsuccessful. In the 11th minute, Wu Qixiang got the ball and slammed it fiercely, but it went out by a foot. Although the attack was very fierce, it pressed until the end of the match. In conclusion, the score was 1-1. The Chinese Mixed Team will leave Shanghai for the north on the 4th of next month.

### Business World: Commentary: Loan Syndicates for Supporting Production

It is undeniable that our country's production is lagging behind. The main tool for promoting local products everywhere is the production loan syndicate in the financial world. Therefore, this column argued on April 26 in "The Exchange of Funds Between Cities and Rural Areas" for the active handling of agricultural finance in order to increase food production. It is very gratifying that the Ministry of Finance authorities decided yesterday to organize a rural revitalization lending syndicate to concentrate large sums of money for low-interest lending in rural areas. Undoubtedly, this is a powerful step in supporting agricultural production.

However, the word "supporting production" is of course not limited to agriculture. Industrial and agricultural loan syndicates are both prerequisites for intensifying production. Due to the establishment of agricultural loan syndicates, we hope that the important industrial sectors in the country understand the importance of loan syndicates, have open and honest consultations with the financial world at any time, and promote this organization, either with goods as the main body or with enterprises as the goal. Therefore, we wrote an article on April 13 called "Banking and Industrial Lending."

As for the method of organization, it is better to keep it simple. For example, in the case of industry, when a certain company in a certain industry launches a certain product, it can contact the financial world about the amount of funds needed, and can at any time pledge the collected products as collateral. Within a certain limit, it is shared by the participating banks; within this limit, a certain industry and a certain company can issue acceptance drafts to the syndicate. After the acceptance by the syndicate, the certain industry and a certain company can either sell it themselves or hold it to the participating banks for discounting; the participating banks can decide on their own how to allocate the amount of the above-mentioned discounting based on the situation at any time, and can introduce it to financial colleagues outside the syndicate for discounting; the discount rate should not be too high, in order to comply with the purpose of supporting production; at the same time, it is hoped that the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks will allow the drafts held to be used as collateral, and give them the convenience of borrowing and splitting at a discount of the face value, and it is even hoped that the Central Reserve Bank will allow rediscounting at any time, in order to complete the efforts of the banking industry to help production in the promotion of production enterprises.

### With the Assistance of the Authorities, Various Factories Resume Production; The Supply of Spot Goods is About to Increase; Trade in Various Parts of Southeast Asia Needs to be Restored Urgently

The various factories in this city once showed a sluggish phenomenon, so that both production and sales plummeted. By the previous year, they were actively assisted and adjusted by the authorities. Regarding the problems of raw material distribution, fuel supply, production volume, and promotion, comprehensive solutions were discussed and implemented in order. To date, large and small factories in various industries have gradually shown active and quasi-active states, work has resumed, production has increased, and export improvements are making great progress.

Returning Factories to Start Production

According to the news yesterday, the authorities in the Japanese army are returning the various factories in stages. In addition to a small number that have resumed production earlier, the majority are also being actively planned by the factory owners, and are currently resuming production. They will soon return to a normal state, processing and delivering goods. At that time, the supply of various spot goods will inevitably increase greatly. However, the scarce raw materials needed by the factories to manufacture goods still need to be supplied or distributed in large quantities by the authorities, otherwise, it will inevitably feel slightly difficult.

Southeast Asian Trade Needs to Be Restored Urgently

It is found that the items manufactured by various large and small factories in this city, in addition to supplying to the various companies, business firms, and stores in this city for retail sales, and being transported to various parts of the country, are mostly transported and sold to various parts of Southeast Asia. Therefore, the recovery and prosperity of trade in various parts of Southeast Asia is related to the development of industry and commerce in this city. People in the industrial and commercial sectors are eager to find ways to restore the old situation for Southeast Asian trade, which can not only obtain a large amount of raw materials, but also transport a large number of manufactured products to be sold, it is learned that leaders in the industrial sector have repeatedly suggested to the authorities, and have negotiated good strategies in turn.

### Recall of Loans; Tightening of Bank Funds; Sluggish Business for Banks and Money Shops

In the financial industry of this city, after the authorities issued an order prohibiting speculation, the small banks and small money shops practiced self-discipline, resulting in their business being very sluggish. Furthermore, as a result of the major banks recalling loans, several small banks and money shops felt the tightening of bank funds.

Hoarding and Selling; Prices Falling

Under the circumstances of tight bank funds, general hoarders with scarce funds had to slightly sell off their hoarded goods. Therefore, the black market prices of various goods such as soap have fallen by more than 10% in recent days. However, the general retailers have not yet lowered the prices of their retail goods.

Sluggish Business; Mergers and Change of Business

Due to the sluggish business of the various small banks in this city, in order to adapt to the environment, there is talk of mergers, resulting in the more sluggish business for the general smaller-scale money shops after the military notes stopped being issued. Several small money shops in Hongkou have already changed to other businesses.

### National Sugar Industry Federation to Hold Founding Conference on May 2nd; Circular Sent to Trade Associations in Various Districts to Participate and Deliberate

It is scheduled to convene the founding conference on May 2nd. A special circular has been sent to the sugar industry trade associations in various districts to send representatives to participate in the conference to discuss the progress together.

### Noteworthy: Newly Established Financial Institutions

Thoroughly investigating hoarding and severely punishing speculators are the unified hopes of the people at present. However, at this time when everyone is eagerly anticipating rectification, the new establishment of banks, money shops, enterprises, and companies is still like bamboo shoots after a rain, which is something worthy of special attention.

Previously, the National Government issued an order prohibiting financial institutions from engaging in commerce, followed by an order prohibiting the establishment of new financial institutions. However, after the promulgation of the order, there were still banks and companies established. Were these newly established banks permitted by the Ministry of Industry before the government issued the order? Or are they relying on some special reason? Disregarding the law is baffling.

Most of the enterprises established since September of last year have a speculative purpose. They maintain a special relationship with specific banks and act as mobile units for the banks. Seeing their behavior of buying Baohua stocks, one can imagine that various enterprises have the risk of hoarding and speculation.

Although there are no clear statistics on the number of enterprises, according to estimates by a certain agency in the concession, there are no less than a thousand large and small. Even with the lowest estimate, there are more than five hundred. During the period of promoting the new economic policy, financial, commercial, and industrial institutions that can promote the revival of industrial production should have been encouraged. However, commercial institutions that have no connection with industrial production, or even those that only have a superficial relationship, and even companies with no reserve funds and ordinary unimportant factories are all established for speculative profit. Regardless of whether they are hoarding, such indiscriminate establishment is a problem worthy of attention. (From the Continental News on April 29th)

### Preparatory Personnel for Various Industry Associations in Jiangsu Province Determined

The General Rules for the Organization of Grain Industry Associations have been promulgated by the Ministry of Food.

### Strengthening the National Government and the Hoarding Problem (I)

The political importance of the hoarding problem has been repeatedly discussed. The reason why we repeatedly raise this issue in detail is that the hoarding problem is the biggest obstacle to the development of the National Government's politics, economy, and ideology. This problem cannot be simply discussed and resolved as an economic problem or a technical problem. It is a comprehensive issue of establishing China's participation in the war system, and it must be properly resolved along the lines of strengthening the National Government and promoting the established national policies of the new economic policies of China and Japan, in order to be pertinent. The key to the solution is very complicated, and there are inseparable connections between them. Several points of view are listed below:

First: How should the National Government solve the hoarding problem this time to strengthen the credibility of the National Government?

Second: With what kind of vision should we observe the relationship between China's state capital and the hoarding problem?

Third: How should pure Sanmin Zhuyi be developed as the basis for solving this problem?

Fourth: What is the relationship between the price problem and the production problem, and how should this relationship be resolved?

Fifth: What is the significance of solving the hoarding problem in the economic war against the Chongqing regime?

Sixth: What is the relationship between solving the Shanghai national capital and the hoarding problem? What is the relationship between China's financial capital, industrial capital, commercial capital, and the hoarding problem?

Seventh: How should the National Commercial Association be strengthened to solve the hoarding problem?

Eighth: Should the Japanese people promote the solution of the hoarding problem in an objective sense?

Ninth: What is the significance of the remarks on the hoarding problem in the current stage of ideological warfare in China?

Tenth: How should the gap between the Chinese reality after participating in the war caused by the hoarding problem be overcome, and what methods can be used to further realize the ideal?

In addition to the above points, there are many more issues that should be raised. In short, the various problems caused by hoarding are the problems of the National Government itself. The above-mentioned points of view, such as how to solve the hoarding problem, how to strengthen the National Government under the war, and how to implement the new policy, can be summarized into one problem. The interrelationships described above are extremely important. The highest authorities of China and Japan should express effective and appropriate theoretical and practical determination, and it is hoped that the general public will have absolute trust in this in order to promote the feelings of the people of China and Japan and smoothly solve this problem. All empty talk is of no benefit and must be avoided. (Translated by Yunpeng from the Continental News on April 29)

### Study Shops · Students

— Ye Renhu

"Complete departments," "flexible time," "limited enrollment," "apply quickly," "low fees," "express completion in × months," the study shop owner uses all his skills to attract customers. Time, economy, and effectiveness, everything is carefully considered for future customers. It is truly cheap and good, with excellent "color," "fragrance," and "taste."

School has started, and the enrollment results are indeed not bad. The classroom is full of men, women, fat, thin, tall and short, and hundreds of different students. There are vocational youths, day school students, hard-working students, those who steal the name but have no substance, ... and even those who regard the school as a place to pursue the opposite sex.

However, "studying together" is ultimately different from commodities. After paying the price, if you don't study hard, even if it's "express," you still won't get anything in the end.

Gradually, the number of people in the classroom decreases day by day, finally showing a terribly sparse scene, although the teachers are still barking and jumping around.

The semester is almost halfway through, but the enrollment advertisements are still hanging, but the "school start date" and "limited enrollment" have been changed to "classes have already started" and "limited remaining places."

The effectiveness of the advertisement has not been completely lost after all. Sometimes, two or three new customers are recruited, regardless of whether the courses are continuous or cannot be inserted in the middle. In short, as long as there is actual payment, you can "join the class at any time." Fortunately, there are "complete departments," so if this department doesn't work, you can change to another department. If it's not "returning the goods," you always have to "accommodate"!

The study shop owner seems to understand the psychology of the customers quite well, and then changes into a set of "spring new class" and "express special class" outfits, so the classroom is crowded again!

### Hesitation

— Wei Huan

A "hesitant" young man, although possessing perfect ideals and a spirit of moving forward, often encounters small setbacks and recalls the "malicious criticism" and social contempt of others who are "prisoners of the old society." This makes him hesitant and allows "hesitation" to linger in his heart. From then on, he wanders in the middle, failing to "persevere" and accomplish anything. A great career is thus "smothered and disappears," only to be ridiculed by others. How regrettable!

On the contrary, a "strong-willed" young man, although encountering failures, tasting the world's "sarcasm and ridicule," and suffering the attacks of "malicious criticism," does not despair or "hesitate." Still based on the "indomitable" spirit, he is not afraid of difficulties and moves forward. He harbors the ambition to "relieve the frustration" and "die with hatred." Finally, he invents "things," discovers "truth," and steps into the ranks of "success." This kind of person is what we "sing praises to day and night."

Therefore, "hesitation" is the destroyer of "career" and the thorns on the road to "life" success. "It" must be destroyed, and "life" will be bright and glorious.

"Malicious criticism," social "sarcasm and ridicule"... these are all part of the "bad environment," which is the driving force behind "hesitation." But we cannot "refuse to eat because of choking," blaming the "bad environment" and abandoning the responsibilities we should bear, without working hard. You must know that the modern world needs more "truth" and more "things" to make it brilliant and civilized.

In short, what the modern world needs are people who are "strong-willed" and "dare to act," not people who are "hesitant" and "irresolute." Therefore, those who are "hesitating" and "wandering on the way" should hurry up and "work hard"! Invent one more "thing" for the world, discover one more "truth," and make the world more brilliant and civilized.

### Harmony and Simplicity

— Hui Ren

Artists demand harmony in color coordination; musicians demand harmony in the rhythm of tones; our lives even more demand harmony in the progress of life.

Disharmony in life - anger, worry, according to actual tests, is extremely harmful to the cells of life. In other words, disharmony in life is self-harm, shortening the course of one's life!

The first condition for seeking harmony is simplicity. The color coordination of pattern paintings often uses similar colors and opposite colors for harmony. The rhythm of musical instruments' tones is harmonious with regular sound waves. Why can't we explore the harmony of our lives in the realm of simplicity?

Modern life is naturally complex. However, complexity is not opposed to simplicity. Mess is the enemy of simplicity. Complexity with order, with arrangement, united, is also simplicity, and the simplicity unified from complexity is also the most complete simplicity, the most beautiful simplicity.

People's irritability and restlessness in life are often treasures bestowed by confusion. Lack of order in clothing and food often leads to melancholy thoughts, hesitation and indecision in thinking often lead to painful feelings, and aimless walking often leads to boredom. If you drive away the mess and dispel the confusion, irritability and uneasiness will also run away.

"Simplifying life" is indeed a famous saying containing great truth. The simpler life is, the more harmonious the mood of life is. You must find clues from the complexity of life, draw out the logic, and give it a simple arrangement and treatment: give a regular fusion to the fixed life of clothing, food, and housing, and there will be a single law for time and place. The thoughts in the mind must also be simplified, the ambition is one, the hopes are connected before and after, combined on one road, the will is firm, and any obstacles cannot shake it in the slightest. Then completeness is waving in the future, success is welcoming in the future, where will you be attacked by anger, hatred, resentment, and grief!

### Purpose and Method

— Ji Wei Yi

People are born with a "purpose." Having a "purpose" is also because of a "purpose" that a person will go to work, eat, ... and do the daily things that must be performed. Society will only be able to transform from the primitive era of eating raw meat and drinking blood to the enlightened culture of today. The world will only be described as: turning like a huge wheel. Perhaps some people think that "purpose" is an obstacle to freedom, because of "purpose," we cannot move freely and act recklessly. Yes, noble "purposes" do not allow these things to happen. But, bad "purposes" are fundamentally seeking these things, then I can't say with certainty: "purpose" is absolutely an obstacle to freedom.

Once a "purpose" is set, it must be carried out and methods must be found to achieve success. Therefore, the same "purpose" can produce many dissimilar "methods" to carry it out due to the different wisdom and character of each person.

The achievement of a great cause is certainly worthy of our great celebration, but the value of its "method" of success must also be considered to determine its value. If the "method" of achieving it is dirty and despicable, then no matter how difficult this work is, it will always be despised. Conversely, if its success does not harm others and is achieved step by step with the greatest effort, then it can have its true value.

The success that the ancients called "one general succeeds and ten thousand bones wither" is not desirable. We must not build the bronze statues of one or two people on the foundation built by the livers and brains of thousands of compatriots. We should recognize that this success belongs to the public.

Often some people think that as long as success is achieved, regardless of whether it is obtained by dirty means, this concept is absolutely wrong.

If we want to achieve true success, first we must have a superb "purpose" that does not deviate from the real environment, and then we must use the most effective "method" that does not hinder others to carry it out.

### Stand Firm

— Yu Huai Rui

Xiao Qing remembered seeing such a couplet there: "Eat your fill, stand firm." In today's expensive world, the first line is no longer appropriate, but the four words "stand firm" are a timeless truth for being a person.

In the long run, many scientists, revolutionaries, explorers, ... in ancient and modern times, when their careers were just starting, were often scorned, ridiculed, and even scolded by ordinary people around them who were short-sighted and confined to prejudices, but they were not afraid at all, they identified their goals, stood firm, and worked hard with perseverance and unwavering confidence. In the end, they achieved their immortal great cause. Their names occupy a very important place in the history of mankind, shining brightly for thousands of years!

In the present day, there are some people in society who, although their income is very meager, can be thrifty everywhere, willing to live in simplicity, walk slowly, and eat thin porridge. If they don't have money to add new clothes, they will just make do with mending. Although the ordinary people around them laugh at them and despise them, they are not confused by the eyes of the efforts, but just stand firm and continue to do so with peace of mind. So although rice is as precious as pearls and firewood as cassia, and everything is soaring, they can barely get by. On the other hand, another group of people with higher incomes, because they cater to the social worship of prosperity, pay attention to face and ostentation everywhere. They must wear gorgeous clothes, eat fine food, travel by car when going out, and be served by servants at home, all to show their wealth. As a result, they cannot make ends meet, their debts pile up, the timid ones sit in a city of sorrow all day long, anxious, and the treacherous ones embezzle public funds, defraud people of money, and as a result, they are discredited and increase the number of crimes in society.

Therefore, whether for career, learning, or life, we should always remember these four words: "stand firm."

### The Invention of the Stethoscope

— Gao Dao

Everyone has seen doctors often put a pair of stethoscopes on the patient's chest and back to listen to the sounds from the heart and lungs to determine the disease. This pair of small trumpet-shaped things, although very simple, its invention also hides a very interesting story!

The sounds from the heart and lungs, due to the obstruction of the trachea and bronchi and the disturbance of internal organ noises, often make it difficult to hear clearly from the outside. Laennee had already seen the importance of auscultation for eliminating diseases in 1819. However, when experimenting, he encountered the above-mentioned difficulties. Especially for obese people, the mechanical sounds from his chest, once transmitted to the outside, would even disappear. Laennee had also encountered such patients. His ideal, before it was realized, was therefore even more shadowed. But behind the shadows, the seeds of the invention of the stethoscope were buried.

One day, Laennee saw a group of children playing on a pile of wood, one of whom put his ear to one end of the wood, and the other stood at the other end, knocking on the wood. Their signals were transmitted from the wood. Seeing this, Laennee's mind was suddenly touched. He hurried back to the hospital and rolled a paper book into a round shape. This is the first stethoscope in history.

When Laennee put one end of this roughly made thing on the patient's chest and the other end connected his ear to listen, the onlookers were shocked. Finally, his experiment was successful. Bursts of heartbeats crossed the human body, passed through the good book, and clearly entered Laennee's eardrum. This sound, to his ears, was better than the most wonderful music in the world!

Soon after, Laennee made a small trumpet-shaped wooden stethoscope. From then on, with the progress of the times, the stethoscope was gradually improved to today's form.

### Life Artization

— Pomegranate

Do you feel bored with life? Bored? How to eliminate boredom and boredom: you must be very interested in studying this question, right? Then, let me tell you that only the artization of life is an effective medicine to eliminate boredom and boredom.

Therefore, life must be artistic, that is, to make life never wither, especially those who work hard, can have some time to appreciate the works of art such as music and paintings, and can further apply them to your life, you will not feel bored and bored. Therefore, you feel happy about the surrounding environment, and the effect of work is also improved invisibly.

Here is a very good metaphor: I think that life cannot be separated from morality, and morality is the beauty of the spirit. The cultivation of moral thought is very necessary. And the material environment also has a close relationship with moral thought. Therefore, the artization of life is to make people placed in it, their thoughts are pure, their body and mind are happy, and they have a great interest in work.

I think that life and art have a close relationship and should be integrated.

### Feet

— Zhu Min

The Creator fairly gives everyone a pair of feet.

But the same feet have different uses.

Pulling heavy vehicles on the road requires feet, and playing all night with a dazzling dancing girl also requires feet.

The feet of laborers are their lives. Having nimble feet means having food to eat. They repay the Creator's virtue of cherishing life with the greatest enthusiasm.

However, the feet of old masters and mistresses find it difficult to climb stairs, and the feet of young masters and young ladies find it too far to go to work. Their feet are superfluous, and in the end, they only serve as companions for leather shoes and silk stockings.

This may be something that the Creator did not expect!

### A Thought

— Liang Yue

Sages and fools, although they are as different as clouds and mud, their initial distinction is only due to the difference in "one thought."

They seem to initially stay at the intersection of two roads. The fool walks down the wrong path without thinking, while the sage walks down the right path after deep consideration. They proceed separately, and the distance between them increases accordingly. This is what is called: "A small error in the beginning leads to a great deviation in the end." This is what is called: "The sage becomes more sage, and the fool becomes more foolish."

Therefore, it can be seen that a huge difference occurs due to "one thought."

So, how can we not be careful about this "one thought"? It is a key to our future success or failure!

### Maxims for Self-Cultivation

— Wei

Dealing with difficult things is like sorting out a tangled thread. The more anxious you are, the less you can find the clue. You just need to be patient and restrain your temper, and you will definitely not be hindered by difficulties, and you will be able to overcome them.

"Hope" is a bright lamp that guides the dark and vast journey of life. A proper hope can enhance the true interest of life; however, hope is not something that can be produced out of thin air or without feeling. Therefore, the "stimulus" that creates hope also becomes an essential element of life.

"Diploma" is just a piece of magical waste, and "real learning" is a weapon with divine power.

### Exhibition of Art Treasures from Famous Collectors to Donate Proceeds to Scholarship Funds

(1) Mr. Ha Shaofu, the master of Baotie Yanzhai, also known as Old Man Guanjin, has a family collection of calligraphy and paintings from past dynasties, the result of more than fifty years of effort. He has a vast number of fine pieces. The iron inkstone in the old man's collection is especially a rare treasure. The inkstone has been appraised by famous figures both domestically and abroad, such as Cang Shuo, Qiu Nong, and foreign dignitaries such as Mr. Inukai Tsuyoshi, who personally inscribed words on the scrolls, confirming that it is a relic of the Song Dynasty, making it an even more priceless piece. The Ha family is known for their charitable tradition. Now, feeling that cultivating outstanding students from poor backgrounds is the duty of all Chinese people, his descendants have decided to publicly exhibit the precious inkstones, paintings, and other items collected over the years. This will not only allow people from all walks of life to appreciate them, but also use the proceeds, after deducting expenses, entirely as scholarship funds. This is a beautiful undertaking that achieves two goals at once. The exhibition period is from May 1st to 5th, at the Ningbo Fellow Association hall.
