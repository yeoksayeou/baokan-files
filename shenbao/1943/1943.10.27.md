### Promotion of Postal Transport

In the current decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, striving for victory is of paramount importance. According to current trends, while the foundation for victory has been laid, its final completion still requires efforts from all sides. Modern warfare is called total war, and the so-called "total strength" includes all forces directly and indirectly related to the war. Military affairs are certainly important, but politics and economics are equally important. Since we are a participating nation, we must each exert our maximum effort within all sectors of the total strength scope to create a powerful overall strength and achieve victory.

Traffic and transportation bear the responsibility for the flow of human and material resources, and everyone knows the urgency and scope of their need in wartime. The strength or weakness of transportation capacity is one of the main factors determining the outcome of the war, which need not be reiterated. Therefore, as we cooperate with our ally Japan in striving for final victory, strengthening transportation capacity is undoubtedly a pressing matter of immediate concern.

Secondly, from the perspective of people's livelihood and economy, the circulation of materials and the adjustment of supply and demand also depend on the smooth flow of transportation. Therefore, those who discuss the problem of commodity prices list transportation obstruction as one of the main factors for rising prices. If we hope for commodity prices to fall back, we must find ways to clear transportation bottlenecks. From the perspective of solving people's livelihood problems, increasing transportation capacity is also a matter of immediate concern.

In theory, increasing transportation capacity is a matter of utmost urgency. However, in reality, there are of course many difficulties. The main one is the lack of gasoline, which prevents highway automobiles and shipping vessels from operating smoothly due to fuel problems. Secondly, there is a shortage of automobiles, ships, and parts. Our heavy industry and vehicle and shipbuilding industries are extremely backward. In the past, we relied heavily on foreign countries. Since foreign shipping has been suspended and sources have been cut off, domestic production has not been able to keep up. Therefore, the lack of modern transportation tools is extremely pitiful. At the same time, obtaining fuel is even more difficult. Therefore, the current transportation capacity is not only unable to increase compared to before, but may even decrease further, which is an extremely serious problem.

However, since the transportation problem is extremely important, we must find ways to remedy it in terms of the situation. Therefore, we propose a postal transport method as an aid to solving transportation problems in today's environment. The postal transport system has a long history, originating in the Zhou Dynasty and reaching its full development in the Yuan Dynasty. It became even more comprehensive during the Qing Dynasty. However, the postal stations of past dynasties were only limited to delivering official documents, which is not entirely the same as the meaning of transportation. And everything from the organization and management of postal stations, funding, and itineraries, etc., is sufficient for historical reference. How to imitate the ancient postal station system, using human and animal power, adapting to local conditions, setting up stations at regular intervals, with stations relaying to each other, in order to enhance transportation capacity, should be the first thing to research and plan.

The unit of postal transport is smaller, and the time for delivery is longer. Its effectiveness cannot be compared with modern transportation tools. But the essence of transportation does not lie entirely in speed at one time and place, but also in its constant and continuous source. Therefore, transportation with sustained power, regardless of the tools used, is the main transportation. The spirit and value of postal transport lie in its lasting and continuous flow. However, postal transport operations are complex and cumbersome, and take motive power as the main factor. Obtaining motive power and sources, especially using carriers as the backbone, means the advance of postal transport really takes scientific management and mobilizing the masses as a prerequisite. Only through scientific methods and rational management can we handle complexity with simplicity; only by mobilizing the masses and launching human power can we achieve practical results.

Feeling the importance of the transportation problem, and considering the actual environment, we propose the postal transport method, and earnestly hope that the government authorities and all sectors of society will pay attention to it. How to plan and how to promote it will be discussed further in future articles.

### Yesterday's Provisional Parliament Opens; The Emperor Bestows a Gracious Rescript, Hoping that the Hundred Million Will Be of One Mind to Achieve the Goal of Victory

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - The opening ceremony of the 83rd Provisional Imperial Diet was solemnly held at the House of Peers in the presence of His Majesty the Emperor on the 26th. His Majesty the Emperor, wearing an army uniform and adorning medals, accompanied by Chief Aide-de-Camp Hyakutake and Grand Chamberlain Matsudaira, departed the Imperial Palace at 10:45 a.m. and arrived at the venue at 11:00 a.m. The Diet members offered their deepest respects, and His Majesty the Emperor bestowed a gracious rescript. The opening ceremony concluded, and His Majesty the Emperor returned to the Imperial Palace at 11:15 a.m.

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Emperor's rescript at the opening ceremony of the Diet is as follows: We hereby hold the opening ceremony of the Imperial Diet and inform the members of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives that our expeditionary forces have overcome all difficulties, fought bravely everywhere, displayed military prowess, and the construction of Greater East Asia is progressing day by day, and our alliances with friendly nations are becoming increasingly consolidated, for which We are deeply gratified. The current situation is still critical. The hundred million people should be of one mind, exert their total strength to defeat the enemy's wild ambitions. We trust in the loyalty and bravery of our subjects, and hope for the speedy achievement of the war aims. We order the Ministers of State to submit to the Imperial Diet emergency supplementary budget proposals and legislative bills related to the current situation, and hope that you will understand Our intentions, deliberate harmoniously, and assist Us in governance.

### At the 83rd Session of the Diet; The Prime Minister Delivers a Policy Speech; Fully Performing the Grave Responsibility of the Decisive Battle

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Tojo's policy speech at the 83rd Provisional Imperial Diet is as follows: At this opening ceremony, I am deeply honored and grateful for the gracious rescript bestowed by His Majesty. I hereby deeply hope to share the Imperial will with you all, to exert our full strength to carry out the grave responsibilities under the decisive battle, so as to achieve the war goals at an early date, and ease the Emperorâ€™s mind. It has been almost two years since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Under the Imperial power, the soldiers of the Imperial Army have overcome all kinds of hardships and crushed the stubborn counterattacks of the enemy, and the results of the war have continued to expand. I and you should sincerely thank the officers and men of the Imperial Army for their good planning and fighting, and for their great merits and hard work. At the same time, on this occasion, I would like to express my deepest condolences to the heroic soldiers who died in the line of duty, and I hope that the wounded soldiers will recover soon and rise again to serve the country. I also express my heartfelt sympathy to the families of the fallen. On the other hand, it is also reminiscent of the firearms and the ordinary citizens, who constantly send their brothers to the front line, and concentrate on enhancing their combat power, so that the soldiers at the front do not have to worry about the rear, and can give full play to their combat power. I and you express our deepest gratitude for the continuous contributions and hard work of the citizens.

Abundant Combat Power

Looking at the current war situation as a whole, since the humiliating defeat of the British and American forces, the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia have become more and more united, with the Empire as the center. The combat power of the Empire, with its abundant resource treasures, has been rapidly enriched. The enemy, Britain and America, shocked by this fact, have decided to carry out a major counterattack against the Empire in an attempt to defeat the Empire. As a result, the enemy, Britain and America, took all risks and spared no means to launch a counterattack, so the fighting became increasingly fierce. At this time, when they dare to launch a fierce attack, the Empire is also determined to launch a fierce attack on them, destroy the enemy's combat power, and ensure victory. At this critical moment, the only responsibility that our citizens should fulfill is to rapidly increase our strength, quickly make preparations, and be able to destroy the combat power of Britain and America so as to respond to the needs of the front line. However, this responsibility is by no means easy. What we thought and did before will not achieve anything. All citizens must truly eliminate all inertia, eliminate all obstacles, and devote all their efforts to achieve success. Moreover, the evolution of the war situation does not allow us to hesitate for a moment. The reason why the government previously formulated the "Essential Guidelines for Implementing National Policy Under the Current Situation" is precisely for this purpose. The reason for requesting the convening of the Diet this time and for praying for the deliberation of various emergency bills related to the current situation is also for this purpose. The purpose of the government's plan to reform the implementation of national policy this time is to make the relationship between the command and the state affairs closer, and to promote a lively war guidance policy, implement flexible diplomatic policies, cooperate to complete the war, and strengthen various domestic attitudes. The goal of strengthening the domestic situation is to rapidly increase military production with indomitable determination, and strive to expand air combat power, taking this as the center, and thoroughly strengthen the Empireâ€™s support situation. Today, when all 100 million citizens of our country are engaged in combat deployment, and the officials and the people are of one mind to concentrate their total strength on the great war with a new spirit, the government, under this belief, is determined not to stick to the past traditions, eliminate all obstacles, and implement the necessary policies.

Strengthening Internal Defense

Regarding the specific policies for strengthening the domestic situation, there have been repeated statements, the important ones being the decisive transformation of administration, the expansion of the number of national officials, and the strengthening of the domestic defense situation. The government should adopt comprehensive measures to inspire the people and unify the national strength so as to realize these policies. Based on the above purpose, the government has rapidly begun to implement policies to strengthen the domestic situation. Regarding the policy of decisive transformation of administration, the government has first decided to establish the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, the Ministry of Military Supplies, and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, and to improve the administrative structure, greatly reduce the number of civil servants, and to reform government affairs so as to simplify the budget thoroughly. As for the expansion of national mobilization, it will be implemented as soon as possible. Measures such as suspending the general conscription deferment for students, expanding the scope of conscription, and making it universal have been taken, and strategic and extraordinary measures regarding education have also been decided. Regarding the strengthening of the domestic defense situation, in order to unify the domestic defense policies, a General Headquarters for Air Defense will be established, and policies such as dispersing the population and facilities have been decided. I believe that whether the strengthening of the domestic situation can be implemented quickly and thoroughly will also determine the success or failure of the Greater East Asia War. The government, in view of this, will approach the implementation of the matters that have been decided and the many matters that should be started with a firm and continuous attitude, so as to achieve results and satisfy the demands of the operation. In this unprecedentedly important war situation, the government earnestly hopes that the citizens will wholeheartedly cooperate, and that the Empire will rise up to eliminate all obstacles for the sake of self-preservation and self-defense. I believe that this significant war will inevitably be won by us. Looking back at the operations since the beginning of the war, observing the current situation in Greater East Asia, and the general trend of the offensive and defensive battles between us, our belief in victory is becoming more and more firm. Moreover, our 100 million officials and people are all engaged in combat deployment in the current stage of the war, which is a turning point. Concentrating all our strength on destroying Britain and the United States for His Majesty the Emperor, the only future for us is victory.

European Situation

Looking at the situation in Europe, the shameless betrayal of the Italian Badoglio faction is deeply regrettable to us. However, their actions only plunged the Italian people into a dead end, suffering the misfortune of charcoal, and the Axis powers' inevitable victory situation has not been shaken. Moreover, thanks to the swift and appropriate measures taken by FÃ¼hrer Hitler, Commander Mussolini was able to make a comeback, unite his patriotic comrades, and establish a republican government to work with Japan and Germany to eliminate Britain and the United States. The governments of Japan and Germany have immediately recognized the new republican government, so I would like to express my heartfelt congratulations on the Commander's comeback and wish them courage to fight in the future. Today, Germany, in order to respond to the new situation in the European theater, has made thorough preparations for coping strategies under the unified determination of the whole country, implemented large-scale national mobilization, and established a stable system in Europe, and is preparing for new combat plans. The Empire is confident that its ally Germany will reap the expected results in this new operation, and that the day when it joins hands with the Empire to subdue Britain and the United States is near. In addition, looking at the East Asian situation, the great cause of liberating the countries and ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, which have been devastated by Britain's ambition for many years, and freeing them from their cruel shackles, has built a solid foundation with firm steps. The independence of Burma before and the independence of the Philippines now can be seen as examples. Based on international integrity, the Empire will ensure that all its agreements are fulfilled. This is a true expression of the great ideals of national founding in the year 8, and is also the Empire's basic philosophy. Now, in Manchuria, the people are united from top to bottom, their friendship with the Empire is growing stronger, and they are cooperating with the Empire in terms of both material and spiritual resources. Here, the Empire expresses its deep gratitude for its cooperation, and at the same time hopes for its limitless development in the future.

### Revision of the Sino-Japanese Treaty to be Embodied; Agreement Reached on Pursuing the War

Regarding the Republic of China, since the beginning of this year, the Empire has actively proceeded with the concrete implementation of returning concessions, as well as a number of cases, in accordance with its established policy, which is already a well-known fact. Moreover, regarding the revision of the Sino-Japanese Treaty, it will soon be embodied. When Chairman Wang of the National Government visited Japan earlier, he had talks with me. We exchanged views on the path for China and Japan to jointly pursue the war, and we reached a complete agreement. I express my heartfelt respect for his ambition to achieve "China for the Chinese" and his spirit to advance for the liberation of one billion people in Greater East Asia. At this time, the Chongqing side is still engaged in fratricidal strife, unable to participate in the great plan of China's rebirth, and unable to jointly engage in the common cause of the Greater East Asian nations, which is truly regrettable. However, I have deep sympathy for the people under the rule of the Chongqing side.

Regarding Thailand

The four northern states of Malaya and the two states of Shan have been incorporated into Thai territory. Now, the relationship between Japan and Thailand is becoming more and more solid. The Empire is deeply grateful for Thailand's cooperation. At the same time, the Empire sincerely wishes to provide full cooperation for the prosperity of Thailand. Regarding Burma, that country declared its independence on August 1. Burma has been groaning under the persecution of Britain for more than a day. However, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, Burma resolutely rose up and placed its full cooperation on the Empire. Now, the long-cherished wish of the Burmese people has finally been achieved, and their independence has finally been realized. Here, I and you all regard the independence of Burma and its future development with new eyes, and at the same time, we earnestly hope that it will continue to cooperate with the Empire on the front line of the Greater East Asian defense. The Empire will also spare no effort to assist in the prosperity of Burma. On October 14, we have witnessed the

Independence of the Philippines

Republic. Now, the Philippines has broken away from the rule of different ethnic groups for 400 years, and has been liberated from the deception and oppression of the United States in the last 40 years. The 8 million people of the Philippine Islands are now, under the leadership of President Laurel, building a "Philippines for the Filipinos" and cooperating with the Empire to complete the Greater East Asia War. The Empire, based on morality and Greater East Asia, in addition to hoping for the rights of the Philippine people to be developed, is willing to provide all cooperation to complete their cause.

Looking at India

The 400 million people are still groaning under British oppression. In addition, the United States has recently extended its aggressive hand to India. The suffering of the Indian people is indescribable. Due to the tyrannical rule of Britain and the United States and the atrocities of the British and American troops, the conflict between them and the Indian people has become more and more intensified, causing profound social chaos. India has finally fallen into an unprecedented famine. This tragedy is getting worse and worse. Britain and the United States also acknowledge this. Indian patriots have all been arrested and imprisoned by the British authorities, and ordinary innocent people are sitting and waiting to die. This is a world tragedy and a public outrage to mankind, which we cannot stand by and watch. This autumn, Indian patriots, including Subhas Chandra Bose, have risen up for the liberation of their country. On October 21 of this year, they established a provisional government of India. The Empire has stated on the 23rd that it will recognize the government. From now on, the Empire will always support the government with a cooperative attitude to complete independence and liberation. This determination. It is my pleasure to announce this decision publicly through this Diet. The Empire's heartfelt hope is for the complete independence and freedom of India, and the eternal prosperity of its 400 million people. The Empire's goal is to obtain the sincere cooperation of all the nations of Greater East Asia. I believe that this can win the approval of people around the world. At the same time, India's liberation movement and the cooperation of the Greater East Asian nations will surely enable India to achieve independence, freedom and prosperity. The above is an explanation of the government's beliefs in this important situation. I hope you will understand the government's determination and give your heartfelt cooperation. Regarding the budget bill and the legal bill submitted by the government this time, I hope you will deliberate on them and give your support.

### Fierce Battles Between German and Soviet Troops to Seize the Gateway to Crimea; German Troops Withdraw from Important Industrial City in Ukraine

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - In order to break through the Dnieper River defense line before winter, Soviet troops have launched a decisive battle with German troops in the Dnieper River estuary and near Melitopol in recent days. The outcome of the Dnieper River battle will be determined by this battle.

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports: The battle for the Greater Dnieper River estuary and the gateway to Crimea entered a new stage at the end of last week. Soviet troops once again used elite troops to attempt to break into Kryvyi Rih between Kryvyi Rih and Dnipropetrovsk, and increased pressure on both sides. They have crossed the Dnieper River and established a new bridgehead in Dnipropetrovsk, but the focus of the battle is still in Kryvyi Rih. The enemy is attacking with heavy troops, and our army is counterattacking. The German army's position on the Nogai steppe is still the target of the Soviet army's fierce attacks. They are constantly attacking the German army's position southeast of Chaplynka, attempting to break into Nikopol along the lower reaches of the Dnieper River. However, the enemy's attacks between Chaplynka and the Sea of Azov on the 23rd and 24th were severely damaged and repelled by our army. The fighting in the Kiev area has gradually eased. Soviet troops attacked the Smolensk-Minsk highway, attempting to break into Orsha, but failed because the German defense line was strong.

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to military authorities here, in order to implement the German High Command's plan to shorten the front line, German troops have carried out a planned withdrawal from Dnipropetrovsk (southeast of Kremenchuk) on Monday. During the withdrawal, German troops did not engage in fierce fighting with the enemy. The withdrawing troops were very orderly and had already transported all military supplies and heavy equipment to the new position. The rear troops had been preparing for the withdrawal in the dazzling city long ago. Even if the enemy occupies it, it will not be able to find its military value.

German Military Report

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - The German FÃ¼hrer's report on the battlefield states that the fighting in the Melitopol area and southeast of Chaplynka in the southern sector of the front line has developed to a particularly fierce degree yesterday. Soviet troops have repeatedly launched attacks and been defeated. The German army has leveled the sunken areas of the position. The fighting in the Dnieper River estuary is still ongoing. The German army has withdrawn from Dnipropetrovsk. Soviet troops have again attacked Kryvyi Rih (southwest of Dnipro) with new troops. There have been fierce battles north of the city for several days, and yesterday was no exception. The German army attacked the enemy from the northeast, greatly reducing the enemy's pressure on the front. The Soviet side launched an offensive from the bridgehead northwest of Kremenchuk with powerful forces, and was repelled in the counterattack. Fierce local battles have occurred north and southeast of Chaplynka and north of Chervonokonsky. Soviet troops were all repelled. Four Soviet rifle divisions attacked a key line of defense near Kryvyi Rih. The German army launched a fierce counterattack, adjusting several places where the enemy had broken through the defense line, and finally drove the enemy back to their original position. There were no fierce battles west of Smolensk and south of Velikiye Luki. The Luftwaffe cooperated with German aircraft in the battle and cooperated well with the ground troops. From the 22nd to the 25th, the Soviet army lost a total of 188 aircraft, while the German army lost only 14.

### Fierce Battles Underway on the Upper Reaches of the Dnieper River

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports that German infantry, under the cover of heavy artillery and mechanized anti-aircraft guns, has successfully completed its military operation against the Soviet army's outer troops south of Gomel. The situation in that area is special and difficult to reconnoiter, but the German army, despite all difficulties, finally cut off the Soviet army's connection with the rear on Sunday and encircled it in the narrowest area. The Soviet High Command tried to rescue the besieged Soviet troops from the outside, but was blocked by the German army's resolute resistance. The defensive battles on both sides of the Smolensk-Orsha highway are still ongoing. The fighting north of the highway is particularly fierce. Although the Soviet army's offensive is fierce, all German defense lines are being firmly held. A few local gaps have been filled immediately after the German army's immediate counterattack. Generally speaking, the German army has achieved a decisive and significant victory west of Smolensk.

### Soviet Reserve Troops Concentrated on Four Focal Points

At the same time, the Soviet army has concentrated all its available reserve troops on four focal points. A few days ago, the Soviet army was still trying to attack in all directions in order to find a weak point in the German army's forces. Now, it has increased the mobilization of reserve troops and gathered them at the following four major strongholds: between the Sea of Azov and the Dnieper River estuary; northwest of Dnipropetrovsk; south of Gomel; and along the Smolensk-Orsha highway. Fierce battles were still taking place at each of these strongholds on Sunday. Although the Red Army attacked with large tank groups, artillery units, and other heavy artillery, it failed to break through the German defense lines at any point or penetrate deep into the German positions. Several groups of enemy tanks broke through gaps in the German defense lines, but were immediately intercepted and annihilated by German reserve troops. In the southern part of the eastern front, north of Kryvyi Rih, German tank units launched a fierce counterattack and captured no less than 62 enemy tanks.

### Under Cover of Dense Fog, Attempt to Cross the River

The Soviet army, with four infantry divisions and two tank brigades, attacked on both sides of Melitopol. The fierce battle lasted for several hours, resulting in the destruction of 30 enemy tanks. In the late evening, the Soviet army suddenly broke through a point in the German line, forcing the Germans to retreat several kilometers. The fierce battle continued all night, and the fighting was still ongoing on Sunday morning. Under the cover of heavy fog, the Soviet army established two small bridgeheads on both sides of Dnipropetrovsk, but these bridgeheads were not significant. North of Kryvyi Rih, the German defense line was heavily attacked by the Soviet army, but all enemy advances were repelled. The Soviet army lost 35 tanks in that area. When the German tank force launched a counterattack, it cut off a Soviet tank group and captured 62 enemy tanks. On Sunday, the Soviet army lost a total of 197 tanks, and casualties were also considerable.

### German Troops on the North Bank of the Volturno River Hold Advantageous Positions; Fierce Artillery Fire Repels Offensives

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to the German News Agency, in the past few days of combat operations in southern Italy, German forces have achieved defensive victories against numerically superior British and American forces at three strongpoints in the Campania Plain and the Apennines, while also implementing their planned strategy of shortening their lines. The methods employed by the German rearguard have proven extremely effective, not only blocking British and American advances but also repelling them in powerful counterattacks. On Sunday, enemy forces lost 14 tanks and eight reconnaissance tanks in these combat operations, in addition to significant losses in other equipment and manpower. The German defensive victory was so great that the American forces did not pursue the German forces when they dispersed from the aforementioned strongpoints. According to reports from the battlefield in that area, the German forces north of the Volturno River have moved into extremely advantageous positions in the mountains near Sparanise. This natural barrier allows the German forces to defend themselves easily, and repeated American and British attacks have been unsuccessful, instead resulting in the loss of one Churchill tank, nine tanks, and three armored reconnaissance vehicles. On Sunday afternoon, two German assault teams composed of grenadiers and anti-aircraft gunners launched a surprise attack from the side, repelling American reinforcement teams and infiltrating behind several British and American units. As a result, the British and American forces urgently retreated south. Along the upper reaches of the Volturno River, the artillery of the German rearguard attacked and dispersed approaching American columns, inflicting extremely heavy losses on the American forces. The remaining American forces at the German front line were finally cleared by the assault teams. In the area of Baranello, near Colledanchise, German rearguard units and British and Canadian assault teams fought fiercely. The enemy attempted to reach the highway from Foggia to Rome but failed and instead launched a flanking attack. However, as they entered the range of the German artillery, they were subjected to a barrage of artillery fire, and the enemy's attempt collapsed. An attempt by Canadian tanks and reconnaissance tanks to provide relief resulted in the destruction of five Churchill tanks and two reconnaissance tanks. Canadian reinforcements were repelled in a German counterattack, resulting in the destruction of two more Churchill tanks and one reconnaissance tank. In the evening, the enemy dragged their dead and wounded soldiers away from the battlefield, while the German rearguard followed behind the main German force without being hindered by the enemy. The British Eighth Army is still continuing to reorganize its units. A British sapper team launched a fierce attack on a bridge on the Trigno River but was repelled before reaching the bridge. A batch of prisoners of war fell into German hands.

Mountains as Barriers, 2,000 Feet Above Sea Level

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to the Huitong News Agency, German forces have gained an advantage in operations in the mountainous areas of southern Italy. Although the enemy is superior in manpower and materiel, their combat operations have been hindered. Even the deployment of Scottish and Canadian troops to fight in the mountains has not been effective, so the enemy made no progress last week, and their limited advances have no strategic significance. The American troops advancing towards the northern mountain pass of Capua were severely damaged and repulsed by a German counterattack on the 23rd. Part of the American Fifth Army stationed near Rocchetta a Volturno and Sparanise also had no special activities. The positions held by the German forces on Mount Matese, 2,000 meters above sea level, not only prevented the enemy's advance but also controlled the routes to Venafro, Contapullo, and Isernia, which were repeatedly attacked by the left flank of the British Eighth Army. On the 23rd, the German forces launched a surprise attack on the enemy's rearguard a few kilometers southwest of Venafro, near Campochiaro, and the British forces collapsed in panic. On the Campobasso front, the enemy also switched to the defensive. The right flank of the British Eighth Army made some progress in Biferno and Trigno but did not cross the line of Ruscito Montenero. Their vanguard advancing towards Trigno has encountered strong resistance from our army.

Difficult to Cross Minefields on the Highway to Rome

Stockholm, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) - At the beginning of the Allied landing in Italy, there was a tendency to quickly sweep across all of Italy. However, encountering fierce resistance from the German forces, their progress was not as fast as expected, and now they are stalled in a stalemate. A recent dispatch from Algiers stated that Deputy Commander-in-Chief Alexander of the Allied forces in North Africa, when meeting with reporters on the 24th, spoke about the future difficulties of the Italian campaign, saying that there was no significant progress in the Italian campaign because the German counterattacks had been strengthened and powerful reinforcements had been sent. Future battles will be even more difficult. The first objective of the Allied forces is to occupy Rome. The saying "All roads lead to Rome" is almost a lie because almost all roads to Rome are covered with mines to prevent the Allied advance. To date, the Allied losses in the Italian campaign are approximately 14,000 men, including 8,000 British and 6,000 American, it is said.

### Germany Adopts Military and Political Measures to Pacify the Balkans, Enabling Small Countries to Adapt to Its Interests

Ankara, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Turkish government newspaper "Ulus" stated yesterday that since Italy's withdrawal from the war, the smallest countries in the Balkans are also seeking to adapt to their interests.

He said, "We refuse to be pushed around. We want to work for peace in our own way."

### Unrest in Portugal

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Huitong News Agency reporter Coester, the lives of Portuguese people are no longer as stable as before, and Portugal is close to war. People who left Portugal a few months ago will have an even stronger impression if they return today. Most notable are the blackout regulations, with train windows painted with gray-black lines. Portuguese newspapers frequently discuss bread rationing, food control, and air raid drills, all of which cause psychological stress among the people. Outside Lisbon, barrage balloons are suspended in the air, and windows in the city are covered with black paper. Air raid drills are frequently held, medical sirens wail, and ambulances are constantly on the move. Some Portuguese friends asked me about the threats of famine blockade imposed on Portugal by Britain and the United States, which is why imports to the country have sharply declined in recent months. What interests me most is that this pro-British country does not agree with the occupation of the Azores. People openly oppose it in restaurants and bars, but they also understand the government's difficulties. I feel that the Portuguese people take the air raid drills and other precautions very seriously. The Azores incident has made the public aware of the need to train for war.

### San Francisco Earthquake

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A San Francisco radio report stated that San Francisco experienced an earthquake on Monday night. Its intensity was unprecedented in recent years, and telephone lines in several areas were cut.

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japan Sports Association, recognizing that since the Greater East Asia War, the cultures and economies of East Asian countries have become closely linked, but the sports exchanges between the countries have not been strengthened and unified, has dispatched representatives to East Asian countries since this spring to promote sports and jointly discuss the situation. For several months, the representatives have all returned to Japan, and their opinions are completely consistent. It has been decided to establish a Greater East Asia Sports Association and to convene a Liaison Conference of Greater East Asia Sports Representatives in Tokyo on November 28, 29, and 30.

### War Situation of the Japanese Army

Report by the Minister of the Army

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Minister of the Army, Tojo, reported on the war situation at the plenary session of both houses of the Diet on the 26th. The contents are as follows: At the previous Diet session, I reported on the war situation. Now, I will report on the general progress of the war since then. (First)

Northeastern Front

Regarding the battle of Attu Island, I have repeatedly explained in detail in the Diet. The garrison of Kiska Island, without realizing it, continued to bomb and shell the uninhabited Kiska Island about two hundred times. They finally landed there on August 15th. Subsequently, enemy aircraft attacked the northern Kuril Islands again. According to the headquarters' announcement, the number of enemy aircraft that attacked was about thirty in total. Half of them have been shot down by the Japanese army, and at least one-third of the remaining ones were damaged. (Second)

New Guinea

Solomon Islands and New Guinea: Since this spring, a unit of the Japanese army in the New Guinea area has been confronting superior enemy forces in the southern region of Salamaua. On June 30th, part of the enemy army landed east of Salamaua, and on September 4th and 22nd, a strong enemy force landed in Lae and Finschhafen. The Japanese army and air force units in that area are cooperating to attack them. The Japanese ground forces are also acting in unison and are currently attacking the enemy forces in the Finschhafen area, engaging in fierce battles. Furthermore, the Japanese troops fighting near Salamaua and Lae inflicted heavy damage on the enemy and gathered in the northern area of Lae in mid-September. Also, since early October, the Japanese army units in the southern area of Munda have been engaging with enemy forces that have advanced to the right bank of the upper reaches of the Ramu River. The enemy's air power in that area is estimated to have about 1,200 aircraft on the front line and about 1,800 aircraft in the rear. The enemy's tactics involve using superior air power as a vanguard, advancing steadily and methodically. The Japanese army and navy air forces, in close cooperation, either sortie to attack enemy air bases far away or directly cooperate with the ground forces in combat, protecting the Japanese base areas and transport convoys. According to statistics, the recent results of the Japanese air battles show that for every three Japanese aircraft sacrificed, the enemy lost several times that number in aircraft shot down or destroyed. The outstanding combat skills and fighting spirit of the Japanese air force soldiers have consistently achieved remarkable results in local battles. The Japanese ground forces are also unyielding, fully demonstrating the Japanese army's fighting spirit. Since June, the Japanese army in the New Guinea area has inflicted the following damage on the enemy: 500 enemy aircraft shot down or destroyed, 18 enemy transport ships sunk or destroyed, approximately 40 transport ships, and over 50 boats. In ground battles, the enemy's casualties have exceeded at least 14,000. The Japanese army has captured a large number of artillery and military equipment. Combining the statements of prisoners and other intelligence, the enemy's damage is particularly high in terms of manpower consumption. (Third) Southern and

Burma Fronts

The air combat there has gradually intensified. Since June of this year, the number of enemy aircraft attacking each month has reached about 1,000, and in September, it increased to 1,600. Fierce battles have continued throughout. The enemy's air strength in that area is estimated to have about 1,000 aircraft on the front line. The Japanese army air force is currently responsible for air defense in a wide range of areas, including Burma, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaya. They are also conducting patrol missions throughout the Bay of Bengal, Sumatra, and the southern sea of Java, and are preparing to attack northwestern Australia at an opportune moment. Furthermore, the Japanese army on the Yunnan-Burma border suddenly launched an attack in mid-October, catching the Chongqing army by surprise. They surrounded a strong unit of the Chongqing army in the upper reaches of the Nu River, inflicting heavy damage on the Yunnan direct-line army. Battles are continuing. The enemy has repeatedly called for a counterattack on Burma, and their actions are gradually becoming more heated. The Japanese army has strengthened its rear defense posture, preparing to launch the next phase of operations. (Fourth)

China and Manchuria

Regarding the situation in the Chongqing area, it is estimated that the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has a total of about 300 to 400 American aircraft, including long-range bombers. They are currently attempting to attack the Japanese mainland. Since July of this year, the Japanese Air Force has successively attacked the U.S. Air Force bases in Chongqing, Hengyang, Lingling, Jian'ou, Baoqing, Guilin, Kunming, and other places, inflicting heavy damage and thwarting their counterattack attempts, thereby consolidating the first line of defense for the Japanese mainland. Since the latter part of July of this year, the Japanese air force in that area has achieved the following results: approximately 124 enemy aircraft shot down and destroyed, 18 enemy ships sunk and destroyed, and extensive damage to military facilities. The Japanese side lost approximately 40 aircraft. The Japanese army's situation on the China front has improved. As Japanese policies toward China have progressed, the number of Chongqing defectors has increased sharply. The Japanese army will continue to take vigorous action to suppress the Chongqing army and actively destroy their fighting spirit. In Manchuria, the situation is quiet, and the defensive posture is as solid as a rock.

Report by the Minister of the Navy

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) - On the afternoon of the 26th, the Minister of the Navy, Shimada, delivered a speech at the plenary session of both houses of the Diet, reporting on the naval war situation from June 15th to October 20th of this year. The gist of his report is as follows: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army and navy have exerted their full strength in the West Pacific and Indian Oceans. Subsequently, the Japanese army's superior strategic posture in those areas has been further strengthened, and brave operations have been launched, defeating the enemy in various places. However, the enemy has stubbornly counterattacked, and as a result, the overall war situation has entered a decisive phase, and its form is becoming increasingly intense. The Japanese naval forces are cooperating closely with the army to annihilate the enemy in a wide area.

Regarding the Indian Ocean

In order to support the army's operations in Burma, the naval forces have strengthened the defense of the occupied areas and dispatched submarines and aircraft to attack and disrupt the enemy's rear. They have also undertaken the work of various important naval ports far on the east coast of Africa. Furthermore, on October 12th, naval air units launched a long-range surprise attack on Ceylon and Madras on the east coast of India, bombing enemy ships and military facilities. They also raided the northwest coast of Australia, shooting down and destroying a total of 59 enemy aircraft and damaging their military facilities. Regarding the North

Pacific

There was a heroic battle on Attu Island. Subsequently, in late July, the Kiska Island unit skillfully withdrew, without being hindered in any way by the enemy, and retreated to a new position. On September 12th, enemy aircraft attacked the northern Kuril Islands. The Japanese air units immediately scrambled to intercept them, shooting down most of them. Then, on October 14th, Japanese air units launched a surprise attack on Attu Island, bombing enemy military facilities. Thus, in the naval and air battles in the northern defense of Japan, the Japanese naval air force landed on New Georgia Island. The Japanese army and naval landing forces immediately welcomed and studied them, fighting fiercely in various places under the heavy bombing of numerous enemy aircraft, destroying enemy air bases by air strikes, and bombing their ships and landing points, suppressing the enemy air force units. In addition, they also heavily bombed the enemy's rear areas of Vanikoro Island, Funafuti Island, and Canton Island, where the enemy supplies were located. Also during this period, the Japanese water surface combat team repeatedly and forcefully attacked the enemy's southern naval forces in the sea near that area. In summary, in the

Kula Gulf Night Battle

In the naval night battle of Kolombangara Island and several naval battles, six enemy cruisers and destroyers were sunk, and five enemy transport ships and other ships were sunk and destroyed. Since mid-July, the enemy has worked hard to increase its strength, and on August 15th, dispatched a strong force to land on Vella Lavella Island. The Japanese naval forces immediately launched a fierce attack, heavily damaging enemy ships and aircraft. By this point, in the battlefields of the New Georgia Island area, the enemy and our forces were intertwined in fierce battles. Due to the brave fighting of the Japanese army, the enemy suffered severe damage. By early October, the Japanese army units in that area had gathered and retreated to nearby bases, without being hindered in any way by the enemy. The fighting in the eastern New Guinea area was also extremely fierce. On September 4th, when enemy forces attempted to land near Tufi, the Japanese naval air units combined to bombard them fiercely, inflicting heavy damage. On September 12th, the naval air units heavily bombed Morobe Bay, destroying many enemy ships. Also, from October 12th to 15th, they heavily bombed the enemy ships and land military facilities anchored there.

Harvested Great War Results

In particular, on September 22nd, the naval air units on the sea off Cape Cretin, outnumbered and outgunned, fiercely bombed an enemy transport convoy, and engaged in air combat with enemy fighter squadrons that outnumbered the Japanese by six times. As a result, three enemy cruisers, two destroyers, and one transport ship were sunk, and 14 enemy aircraft were shot down. In total, since September, the Japanese naval air units in that area have sunk 18 enemy transport ships, four cruisers, and two destroyers, and bombed 21 enemy transport ships, cruisers, four destroyers, and many other small ships. Regarding the results of the Japanese submarine warfare, from June to October 20th, a total of 20 enemy ships were sunk, totaling approximately 178,000 tons. In addition, on July 21st, an enemy cruiser was sunk south of EspÃ­ritu Santo Island. On September 12th, an enemy Class B cruiser was sunk east of the New Hebrides Islands. Also, on October 3rd, two enemy destroyers were sunk in the South Pacific. At the same time, the Japanese naval forces were also in the various seas of Greater East Asia

Clearing Enemy Submarines

From July to April, the actual enemy submarines cleared were 22. Also, the Japanese naval forces from July to October have gained the following results in various places: 10 enemy cruisers sunk, 18 destroyers sunk, 22 submarines (120,000 tons), and 73 other ships. In addition, the number of enemy ships destroyed was also high. As for the Japanese side's losses, there were six destroyers and twelve other ships. Also, the number of enemy aircraft shot down and destroyed was 1,613, while the Japanese side lost 415. The war situation is becoming increasingly fierce, and the Japanese army and naval forces are fully displaying their power in various places to reduce the enemy's forces.

### The 1st and 3rd Shanghai West Police Bureaus will merge next month, to be uniformly called the First Police Bureau

The Times reports: According to a revelation from a reliable source yesterday, the 1st and 3rd Police Bureaus, as well as the former Shanghai West police force, have already decided to merge on November 1st. The merged police organization will be uniformly called the First Police Bureau.

Other police bureaus will also be reorganized

It is said that the merger of the police organizations in the three districts is a key step in Mayor Chen Gongbo's plan to build a Greater Shanghai. Subsequently, the police bureaus in other districts of the city will also be reorganized. As for the details of the final reorganization, no confirmed information has yet been obtained. In view of the reorganization plan that has not yet been implemented, the First Police Bureau will be the city's police headquarters. Mayor Chen has stated in his Greater Shanghai construction project that there is no need to establish branches in the central districts of the city, the reason being to ensure closer connections in the management of police affairs in various districts.

Original police officers are not expected to be transferred

The merger plan was originally scheduled to be implemented on December 1st. However, the Party Bureau believed that the details of various organizations had already been completed, so it was advanced. At the same time, it is also learned that no ceremony will be held for the merger of the three police bureaus. This is because the various preparatory work has already been completed, and only cooperation is needed for implementation. After the merger, the personnel of the three district police bureaus will not be transferred. However, efforts will be made to unify the uniforms. Given the high prices at present, this is actually difficult, as the number of police officers in the three districts, including those in the police headquarters, is approximately 8,000.

### 50th Period Household Rice - Universal Sale Starts Tomorrow

### Coal Retailers Request Improvement in Rationing

The members of the Shanghai Coal Retailers Association, in view of the fact that the major coal dealers are not distributing coal rations evenly and are seeking undue profits, resulting in a black market, gathered on a certain day, and over five hundred members jointly signed and stamped a petition to Wang Jingwei, the Chairman of the National Government, the Ministry of Industry, the Special Municipal Government, the Japanese Embassy, the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, the Municipal Economic Bureau, the Coal Association, the National Chambers of Commerce Control Association, the First District Public Works Bureau, the Eighth District Public Works Bureau, the Economic Division of the First District Public Works Bureau, and the Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce, as well as government leaders, requesting the cancellation of the illegal coal rationing rights of the major coal dealers, and authorizing the Coal Retailers Association to be responsible for the Qing rationing, and simultaneously dispatching senior officials to thoroughly investigate past instances of embezzlement and corruption, in order to benefit the people's livelihood and maintain business operations.

### Fresh Milk Deposit - Approved in the First District

Regarding the matter of supplying fresh milk to households, a person in charge told a reporter from the Central News Agency, "This Bureau and the Eighth District Public Works Bureau have already handled the registration of fresh milk consumer households, so that each consumer household does not arbitrarily choose a dairy farm. This measure is intended to match the needs of consumer households with the current production of licensed dairy farms. At the same time, it can ensure that dairy farms must supply milk to any consumer household that holds a milk supply certificate issued by this Bureau or the Eighth District Public Works Bureau. Furthermore, at present, most businesses in this city conduct cash transactions. It is no exception that milk companies supply milk daily. However, at present, each milk company does not charge its regular customers daily, but only collects accounts once a month. In view of this, the Bureau has decided to approve the collection of a deposit from its regular customers by each milk company, the amount of the deposit being equal to the price of fresh milk supplied for one and a half months, in order to maintain the minimum retail price of each grade of fresh milk as much as possible.

### Cases of Carrying Old Currency - Will be Investigated According to Law

In order to stabilize the post-war finances, and implement a unified currency, the National Government has designated the Central Reserve Bank's issued Central Reserve Notes as the sole legal currency. All kinds of old currencies in the past have long been explicitly prohibited from use by the Ministry of Finance, and various regulations have been promulgated to punish the carrying of such currencies and obstructing the circulation of the new currency, in order to thoroughly adjust the national monetary system. However, although the Central Reserve Bank has, in accordance with the laws and regulations promulgated by the Ministry, made every effort to redeem them, the old currencies scattered among the people have not yet been fully recovered, and there have been repeated cases of people illegally carrying them. The Shanghai Local Police Department, regarding the handling of such cases, has specially submitted a request to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for instructions, because there are no explicit provisions in the criminal law. It has now been learned by a reporter from the Central News Agency that the Ministry has already telegraphed back to the Department, stating that in handling old currency cases, it should immediately refer to the measures for prohibiting the use of old currency and the measures for the handling and rewards for the seizure of use or carrying of old currency, as promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, and refer to the various announcements of the Ministry for handling, and the District Attorney's Office, upon receiving the order, has immediately notified its subordinate prosecutors, etc., to uniformly investigate according to law.

### Military, Police, and Baojia Personnel - Allowed to Pass During Blockades

The Shanghai Special Municipal Government, in order to comfort the sick, has allowed doctors to pass when there is a blockade or curfew, and traffic is obstructed. The Municipal Baojia Committee has already ordered each district office and self-governing group, etc., to strictly abide by this regulation. In addition to the fact that fire-fighting and ambulance vehicles and Baojia personnel, whether in uniform or plain clothes, should also be allowed to pass, and the approval of the Municipal Government has been obtained for implementation, orders were also issued yesterday to the subordinates to comply with this.

### Supplementary Funds for Private School Teachers and Staff - Distributed Starting Today, Average Allocation of One Hundred Yuan Per Person

The Shanghai Municipal Education Authorities, expressing their sympathy for the difficult lives of the teachers in this city, especially in private schools, which, due to poor management, have difficulty improving the treatment of teachers and staff, submitted a request to the Municipal Government for financial assistance. The Municipal Government has approved the allocation of large sums of money as supplementary funds for teachers and staff in private schools. The first batch, totaling 800,000 yuan for September and October, has been fully received by the Municipal Education Association and is scheduled to be distributed starting today.

Distribution Procedures Strive for Thoroughness

Yesterday, a leading member of the Municipal Education Association told a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency that, regarding the distribution of these supplementary funds, the procedures are striving for thoroughness, and all matters are the responsibility of the management and distribution committee organized by representatives of the education associations in each district. The committee has already conducted a detailed investigation of the teachers and staff of each private school. The supplementary funds are distributed on an average basis, not in proportion to salary. As for teachers and staff who work concurrently in various schools, they can only receive one share. If there are any cases of repeated or inflated claims, the principal of the school shall be fully responsible once they are discovered.

Establishing a Teachers and Staff Cooperative

The leading member went on to say that, in addition to raising the salaries of teachers and staff, the Education Association is also planning to reduce their financial burdens. The Association will establish a teachers and staff cooperative, so that people in the education sector can enjoy the allocation of low-priced goods. These goods are entirely necessary for daily life. The Association is currently in special agreement with various manufacturers to provide goods at flat prices. The cooperative's funds will be publicly raised, and after it is established in the future, it will be entirely for the purpose of benefiting the education sector, and will not contain the slightest profit-making motive.

Soliciting Loans for Impoverished Students

At the same time, the Association is also providing relief to impoverished students who have dropped out of school. It is currently planning to raise loans for impoverished students, with a target of one million yuan. Approximately 200,000 yuan has already been obtained. The Association believes that this target cannot be achieved without the assistance of enthusiastic people in society, so it will soon launch a large-scale fundraising campaign, inviting financial, industrial, and commercial figures from all walks of life to provide full assistance. In addition to individual solicitations, it will also hold ball games, charity sales, and other methods, in order to raise enough funds as soon as possible, so that students can go to school.

Procedures for Issuing Supplementary Funds

The Municipal Education Association has stipulated the following procedures for issuing government supplementary funds to private school teachers and staff:

This Association has received 300,000 yuan in supplementary funds for September and 500,000 yuan in supplementary funds for October from the Municipal Government, totaling 800,000 yuan. There are approximately 8,000 teachers and staff in private schools throughout the city (Districts 1 to 8), with an average of 100 yuan in national currency issued to each person (any odd amounts remaining will be added to the next distribution).

The teachers and staff supplementary funds will be handed over to the executive secretary and general affairs secretary of each district education association according to the number of schools and education personnel in each district. They will jointly sign and affix their seals, and report to this Association with a list of schools from October 27th onwards for issuance to the schools.

After the education association in each district receives the supplementary funds, it shall issue them to each school within the deadline stipulated by this Association (October 27th to 31st). If they fail to issue all of them within the deadline, they must submit the names of the schools that have not yet received them to this Association.

The supplementary funds issued by this Association to each district education association are in the form of school checks. When the principal of each school receives them from the district education association, they must affix the school seal and the principal's personal seal to the receipt and hand it over to the district education association.

When each school distributes the supplementary funds to the teachers and staff, the teachers and staff must sign their names and affix their seals to the receipts, and collect the receipts and submit them to this Association, and this Association will return the receipts to the school (Districts 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8 may make changes due to inconvenient transportation).

Private school teachers and staff who have not yet registered with this Association or the district education association should register quickly within this month in order to receive supplementary funds.

Regarding the plan to distribute soap and matches to each household in Districts 1-8, it has been decided that it will be implemented in early next month, and the 397 retail stores have also been decided to handle the various procedures separately. As for the distribution prices, it has been learned that the Municipal Authority is concerned about public health, and the necessary inspection of its ingredients is also underway, so the district health department is currently conducting a chemical test, which will be completed soon. The same soap will be used and the prices will be determined, and contracts will be signed with each of the soap manufacturers.

Matches may be unified in production

As for the match problem, the raw materials for the eleven match manufacturers are distributed by the Central China Match Distribution Association. The quantity distributed each month must be processed by each manufacturer, and then the quantity must still be handed over to the Association for redistribution to the various manufacturers for wholesale to the various retailers for distribution. The Municipal Authority is planning for the various manufacturers to cooperate and uniformly produce a brand, and distribute it to the citizens as much as possible. The Authorities are currently studying and discussing this issue.

### Social Welfare Bureau Prepares for Winter Relief - Charity Performance to Raise Funds for Relief Home

The Social Welfare Bureau, with the cold winter approaching, and the general homeless poor and the old, weak, disabled, and orphans wandering in the streets of this city being pitiful in the cold, has specially planned winter relief measures, such as distributing clothing and porridge and holding cold shelters, etc. It has been decided to set up the relief home belonging to the Bureau, located on Penglai Road in the South City. There are more than three hundred and fifty old, weak, disabled, orphaned children in the home, and recently, due to the lack of food, they are crying for food, which is particularly pitiful. Therefore, Sheng Guan and others have sponsored a charity performance at the Tianchan Stage, and all the proceeds from the ticket sales will be used as the fund for the home. Ticket prices are divided into four types: 1,000 yuan, 500 yuan, 300 yuan, and 200 yuan. No donations will be collected inside the venue.

### A Paradise for Street Children: Shanghai Fuyou Institute

Gongyi Wharf Street in Jiadu, Nanshi, is now buried under piles of rubble. At the end of the street, a narrow path is marked by barbed wire stretching for several *li*, a characteristic sight of wartime. However, within what resembles an ancient fort amidst the desolate ruins, inside an antique residence enclosed by low white walls, the joyous sounds of children can be heard. A vibrant atmosphere is growing amidst the desolation. Past the snow-white walls and the stone-paved storefronts, a white piece of paper informs you that this is the paradise for educating street children â€“ the Shanghai Fuyou Institute.

Difficult Beginnings

Upon entering the gate, one sees several houses under repair and the installation of electric lights, with workers busily engaged. In the halls and classrooms, teachers and students are focused on their lessons, undisturbed by the arrival of visitors. Dean Ding Fubao and administrator Jiang Tianyi, in discussing the situation at Fuyou Institute, revealed that the creation of such a paradise had indeed required the painstaking efforts of many philanthropists.

Shanghai is a metropolis filled with contradictions. On one hand, there are extravagantly wealthy merchants living luxurious lives, while on the other hand, one can see shocking realities such as poverty, homelessness, unemployment, and crime everywhere. It is precisely the extravagant enjoyment of a few that exacerbates the darkness and suffering of the lower classes. What is most disheartening are the street children, the so-called "little angels of the road," who are without clothes, food, or support, dying of illness and neglect, or committing crimes with impunity â€“ a crisis for society and a loss for the nation. Therefore, a most meaningful charitable endeavor was undertaken.

With academic and moral prestige, Mr. Ding Fubao and Mr. Chen Bingkun, highly regarded in all sectors, deeply appreciated the importance of educating street children and volunteered to undertake this arduous task. In January of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), they founded the Shanghai Fuyou Institute, dedicated to providing relief to impoverished children. The target recipients include street beggars, lost and suffering children, or the children of hidden individuals, children of working men and women who are unable to support them, orphans who have nowhere else to go from refugee shelters, and impoverished children previously cared for by the old Public Concession Children's Home and *Shen Bao*â€™s news office. Initially, limited by manpower and resources, there were only three teaching staff and several dozen children. All funding was sourced by those in charge, who sought support from various relevant parties.

Six months after its founding, the Shanghai Fuyou Institute officially established a board of directors and began fundraising from all sectors. Because people from all walks of life in Shanghai understood the significance of raising and caring for homeless and suffering children for the country and society, and because the directors of the institute were highly respected in society, donations poured in enthusiastically. What was even more commendable was that Dean Ding Fubao, while leading the institute with strenuous efforts, also managed to expand the instituteâ€™s work in educating and caring for street children. By the autumn of last year, a dedicated director, Mr. Wang Ren, was hired to strengthen the workforce. Thus, the Fuyou Institute evolved from a rudimentary organization for educating and caring for needy children into a well-established institution. By this spring, the number of orphans and needy children cared for had reached over 200, and the number of staff had increased to 15. The facilities within the institute were also quite comprehensive. At the same time, a second fundraising campaign was launched, aiming to greatly expand the education of these innocent children, building them into talented people for the nation and preparing them for national rejuvenation.

At 25 minutes, Tung Wah launched a large-scale counterattack. Dai Linjing, with the help of Han Longhai, scored with a long shot, tying the score. Not long after, the first half ended.

Economic Commentary

### Floating Capital Flows into Shanghai

People who are idle and do nothing are called "vagrants"; they are also commonly known as "idle vagrants." In the same sense, treasure and gold that are erratic and unproductive are called "floating capital." Vagrants are unemployed, and floating capital is also "idle" because floating capital has not been channeled into normal productive activities. Therefore, it can also be called "unemployed gold."

Before Shanghai implemented economic controls, the abundance of floating capital could be said to be unparalleled for a time. Because there was no way to disperse the floating capital, the result was an unmanageable spiral of rising prices and rampant speculation. Recently, however, due to the authorities' strict economic controls and crackdown on speculation, those who possessed floating capital have had to make plans to change their ways and find outlets for their capital. As a result, most owners of floating capital have gradually invested in various productive enterprises, while a small number have gradually turned to bank savings. Therefore, the financial situation in Shanghai in late October is unusually stable, and credit is more relaxed than before. In short, an outlet for the overall floating capital in Shanghai has been opened up, and it has dispersed like floating clouds.

Yesterday, there were reports that large amounts of floating capital from Tianjin, unable to find an outlet, were flowing south to Shanghai. This is not something we would welcome. Just as the floating clouds in the sky were beginning to dissipate, another wave is coming. I am afraid that Shanghai's economy, which is gradually seeing clear skies, will be affected again. The abundance of floating capital is like the flooding of a river. While we are trying to guide it effectively, we naturally hope that the river will not continue to rise.

### Flour and Wheat Professional Committee Actively Promotes Work: Production Statistics of Flour Mills Last Month

Since the National Federation of Commerce and Industry's Flour and Wheat Professional Committee implemented unified collection and distribution of flour and wheat, the results have been remarkably good. They have been actively promoting the strengthening and adjustment of internal mechanisms and intensifying the work of flour and wheat collection and distribution in order to fully meet the needs of the people for food. It is understood that the association oversees the major regions in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces.

Flour mills:

Including Fufeng, Yixing, Zhunxin, Sanxing, Dongfu, Huafa in Shanghai; Dahe, Dayi, Xinyi, Sanfeng in Suzhou; Guangyi, Zengyi, Shunfeng, Taiyi, Huaxin, Anfeng, Minyi, Huafa in Wuxi; Chengjin, Dingtai, Zhaoji in Changzhou; Youheng, Jinfeng in Nanjing; Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Gaoyou, and Wuhu, Three Yixing, Huafa, Wuhu, and other 28 companies.

Production volume:

Including 905,057 bags of first-class flour, 883,327 bags of second-class flour, 155,826 bags of third-class flour, and 13,815 bags of fourth-class flour, totaling 1,958,025 bags.

### This Year's Huazhong Rice Crop is Abundant

According to sources in the grain industry, this year's autumn rice harvest in the Central China region is very abundant. The Wuhu area has had a bumper year, while the Kunshan and Changshu areas have also had about 80% of a normal harvest. Only the area near Taicang is slightly deficient. If the purchasing policies are thorough and the adjustments are well-coordinated, the future of the people's food supply should be secure.

### Yesterday's Internal Settlement Meeting of the Money Trade Association

Resolved that the market price will be 7.5 yuan.

The Shanghai Special City Money Trade Association, in view of the upcoming year-end period for various industries in Shanghai, and to ensure that all money shops collect and settle their long-term credit loans, has been contacting the relevant businesses. For those reputable merchants who are unable to settle due to business needs, the money shops have agreed to extend the terms as appropriate.

Therefore, in order to determine the internal settlement market price for December to facilitate settlement procedures, a year-end internal settlement meeting was held as usual at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 26th). As a result,

Internal settlement market price:

The agreed-upon price was 7.5 yuan. It is reported that after the internal settlement meeting, the association held a meeting of executive directors and decided that the interest rate for December will be 5 yuan for deposits and 30 yuan for loans. An announcement has been made to all fellow traders to comply. It is also understood that the

settlement situation for various industries

at the end of the year is good. Most companies have agreed to extend the terms. However, the association has decided to handle new credit loans very carefully, and applications for loans that are not legitimately used for productive activities will not be accepted.

### Ningbo Area Cotton is Also Subject to Unified Purchase

Estimated to be Approximately 120,000 *Dan*

After it was decided that cotton from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces this year would be subject to unified purchase by the Cotton Division of the Chamber of Commerce, there was concern about whether the purchase of cotton in the Ningbo area of eastern Zhejiang would also be handled by the Cotton Division of the Chamber of Commerce. Last year, cotton produced in the Ningbo area was not subject to the control of the old cotton purchasing agencies. It is understood that this year, because Zhejiang's administration has become unified, cotton in the Ningbo area will also be subject to the unified purchase by the Cotton Division of the Chamber of Commerce. All measures will be the same as in other areas. It is estimated that the cotton production in that area this year will be approximately 120,000 *dan*.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Chinese stocks rebounded yesterday, almost erasing the losses from the afternoon. Stocks rose sharply in a straight line from low prices in the morning, then fluctuated in the afternoon but recovered quickly, with a firm footing. As a result, the stock prices were largely the same as at noon the day before, and even higher than the afternoon prices, especially real estate stocks, which were the most active. Transactions were smooth. The stock market situation is summarized below:

Department Stores: Wing On Company opened at a steady price in the morning, then gradually rose amid buying pressure, peaking at noon. It slightly declined in the afternoon. Wing On, Sincere, and China National Goods companies all saw their prices rise. China National Underwear, Guanwai, and Guanghua Department Stores were also stable. Textile: Wing On Textile rose steadily in the morning and remained stable in the afternoon. China Textile Trust, Rongfeng, and Mayar Silk Factory all saw their prices rise. Smaller textile stocks also rebounded accordingly. Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing, Zhenzhong, Guoxin, Tianlun, and Lunhua were all priced higher than the previous day. Jingxu Shirt erased its losses from the previous night, and Jinglun stabilized.

Industry: Da Zhonghua Match rebounded from a low price, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco stabilized, Jiu An Industrial rose slightly, and Xin Ya Construction also rebounded. Datong Business, China, and Guohua shares were all stable. Da Zhonghua Industrial opened 10% higher. Kangyuan Confectionery was in demand in Guanwai, and its price rose again. Guanshengyuan and Standard Food were both on the rise.

New Drugs: Xin Ya Pharmaceutical rose by several yuan, and Zhongfa was also priced higher than the previous day. Zhongxi, Jiufu Pharmaceutical, and Xin Zhong Pharmaceutical rose slightly. Ruixin Pharmaceutical fell slightly, while Wuzhou was unchanged.

Finance: Jincheng and Yeqing opened higher, recovering from the previous day's prices. Continental, Shanghai, and Zhejiang were all unchanged. Zhongyi Trust was slightly lower.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Public Bonds: The market showed another distorted trend yesterday. Because those who had been trading in spot bonds had switched to next-day bonds, which allowed for "mutual offsetting," there were often dozens of accounts involved for a single ten-thousand-yuan bond. Next-day bonds also allowed for one-day rollovers, but commissions had to be paid. For those who insisted on settling the transaction on the same day, the market price could be freely adjusted. The price of C-type bonds was strong at first, but then saw a pullback. Afterward, it gradually rose again. The closing price at noon was slightly higher than the previous day, which was entirely due to the influence of futures. The fact that the other four types of bonds (A, B, D, and E) showed only limited gains is clear evidence of this. The price difference between miscellaneous brands and C-type bonds was very large, and the distorted situation became more and more serious.

Interbank Lending Rate: The Money Trade Association's posted interbank lending rate remained unchanged at 1.2%.

Rice and Grain: There was a shortage of rice and grain arriving by both water and land, and retail sales were slow. Wholesale transactions were lively, and the market trend was upward. Oilseeds were actively sold at retail prices and remained firm. Woolen Fabrics: Standard market prices for woolen fabrics such as riding breeches and camel-hair serge have continued to rise in recent days. The prices of all brands have increased by an average of several tens of dollars per yard. This is because seasonal sales are brisk and orders for coats from mainland customers continue to increase, leading to strong demand. The prices of Zhanghua brand fabrics, which are stocked in all factories and stores, are particularly firm and even higher than listed prices.

### Securities Exchange Sets Business Rules

After the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange was approved by the Ministries of Finance and Industry to resume operations, the resumption ceremony was held on the 29th of last month. All brokers have now been reviewed and announced, and licenses have been issued by the Ministry of Industry. Brokers have also paid security deposits in accordance with the articles of association. The listed stocks have been reviewed and approved separately, and the layout of the market has been completed. Settlements are to be cleared every Monday. It is also reported that in order to prevent securities speculation, the exchange has formulated "Business Rules," which specify the trading security deposits, brokerage fees, market opening and closing dates, official market prices, and all other matters related to trading.

National Forum

### How Should the Broadcasting Association Adjust Programs After Collecting Fees?

The China Broadcasting Association recently announced that all radio listeners in Beijing and Tianjin must sign a listening agreement with the association and pay a monthly listening fee of ten yuan for broadcasting purposes. I think all listeners are processing this, but I would like to bring up the following two points about the current broadcasts for the Bureau to adjust:

Advertising Problem: The number of advertisements broadcast by radio stations in this city recently is very high. Listeners can hear the reporters' eloquent voices as soon as they turn on the radio. The length of these segments often takes up most of the program time, which is uninteresting and even annoying. Radio stations accepted advertisements before the war, originating from commercial radio stations, but commercial radio stations have disappeared since the Greater East Asia War, so there should no longer be this kind of advertising report. Moreover, many of these advertisements are for national products, and they should be immediately banned. Some say that radio stations accept advertisements because of limited finances. Now that the Broadcasting Association has collected listening fees, the radio stations can be maintained by appropriations from the Broadcasting Association.

Program Problems: After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, there was only one radio station in this city with Chinese as the main language, Shanghai Radio Station. In addition, radio stations such as Germany, France, and the Soviet Union mainly used foreign languages, with only one or two Chinese programs, but these mainly reported news and taught foreign languages. Therefore, there seems to be too little for Chinese people to listen to, with only one channel available. In terms of program content, although there are many entertainment and educational programs, there are too many low-level programs, such as Shanghai opera, Yue opera, and comedy. Listening to them is a bit too coarse, so there is a need to adjust the Chinese language programs. - Lei Di

### Reflections on the Municipal School Teachers' Request

â€” An Unfairness

The Shanghai Municipal Government has already issued subsidies to private schools, demonstrating that the government is indeed mindful of the poor living conditions of teachers and staff. It is striving to stabilize the lives of educational staff and increase the salaries of those engaged in education, which is heartening for everyone to see. However, according to news reports, teachers from seventy-two municipal schools, finding their income (220 yuan per month) insufficient to cover personal living expenses (barely enough to buy seven large pancakes a day), are requesting an increase of 800 yuan on top of their base salary of 30 yuan. Given the current prices and the fact that the standard salary for teachers in both northern and southern municipalities is actually above 50 yuan, is this request still considered too high? Consider that before the Incident, a monthly salary of 30 yuan, after deducting 5 or 6 yuan for meals, still left 25 or 26 yuan, enough to support parents, a wife, and children with a simple, frugal life. Now, even if the municipal government acknowledges the poor living conditions of teachers and "approves the request," it would only be enough to support a small family of husband and wife. (This is considering current prices; if prices increase in the next month or two, this meager 800 yuan might not even be enough to support a husband and wife.) If there are parents and children to support, they will inevitably have to struggle just to survive. Where will "stability" be found?

The author shares the importance of educational work and sympathizes with the hardship of elementary school teachers' lives (no, it's not enough to fill one's stomach), and cannot remain silent. Therefore, I especially speak out on their behalf, hoping that the government will provide these "nurses of the nation" with the bare minimum living materials (such as the cost of meals for five or six people before the Incident). At the same time, I also hope that parents whose children are in school will work together to help teachers for the sake of their children's future, so that teachers can focus on teaching and students can focus on learning. The future of the nation is fortunate, and the future of the country is fortunate! Schools should not neglect

Schools Should Not Neglect Air Defense and Seek Innovation

Under the supervision and guidance of the Municipal Bureau and Baojia offices, citizens throughout Shanghai are paying considerable attention to air defense facilities and are following the instructions of the authorities. However, to our surprise, many schools in Shanghai are currently ignoring this issue. When we investigated further, we found that some schools do not have paper on their windows. Sand, mud, and water tanks are nowhere to be seen. Could it be that those in the education sector are more indifferent to air defense facilities than other sectors? Schools are cultural institutions, especially for reading children, who are all the future masters of the new China. Parents entrust their children to schools, placing great expectations on them. Schools should naturally assume responsibility for protecting students during school hours. Only then can they prepare for any eventuality and live up to parents' expectations. Otherwise, if there is an air raid, and the school is completely unequipped, students will be panic-stricken, glass will shatter, children will be injured, and fires may break out. What will be done then? As principals and those responsible, how can they ignore this and not take it to heart!

### A Suggestion to Turn Discarded Tram Tickets into Lottery Tickets

â€” Yuan Liuxian

Ticket sellers skimming fares directly reduces the company's revenue and indirectly increases the burden on citizens. Although the company authorities have repeatedly appealed for public cooperation, it has been difficult to achieve results. The reason is that most passengers are generous and only care if the ticket inspector comes. They are not concerned about whether they have a ticket, whether the fare is correct, or anything else that does not benefit them personally, which is deeply ingrained in the Chinese character. They may even be ambushed by the ticket seller when getting off the tram, which is even more unworthy. My suggestion is that the company authorities should encourage passengers to collect tram tickets and hold monthly drawings, giving prizes worth a hundred times the ticket price to the winners. The advantages of this method are briefly described below:

Passengers holding tram tickets have a chance to win a prize, so they will never pay the fare without taking a ticket or return the ticket to the ticket seller to give to someone else when getting off the tram. With a prize of a hundred times the ticket price, passengers will never accept tram tickets with incorrect fares. The prize vouchers can be used to purchase monthly tickets, so the company does not need to spend extra. However, if monthly tickets are given out directly, there is no advantage of the second point. Discarded tickets scattered on the road are unsightly. Setting up ticket collection boxes or hiring people to clean them up would require expenses. This method can save money. Passengers who skim fares themselves can also be reduced.

Social Service

### The Youyou Nursery Home Appeals to All Sectors for Needy Children

The environment is moving in a difficult direction, and hundreds of needy children are a strong force for the future of society. The burden of educating and caring for these needy children has become unprecedentedly difficult, and urgent new efforts and new contributions are needed to continue this sacred task of educating and caring for needy children.

The Youyou Nursery Home has been established for three years, and is currently launching its fourth fundraising campaign. Despite various difficulties, it has resolutely launched this campaign, proposing the huge figure of 800,000 yuan, hoping that kind people in society who love and care for the home will continue to donate with boundless generosity, so that the weak seedlings can receive the nourishment of sweet dew and thrive.

Whenever the environment worsens, kind people in society who care for the home provide further assistance. They treat the education and care of the needy children in the home as their own affair, protecting them with the greatest "love" in the world. The environment can only reduce the number of unfortunate children (the home dismissed some children last year). The environment can only reduce the effectiveness of the donations that have already been raised, but it can never sever the close and warm love that kind people in society have always given to the home. A difficult environment has produced excellent methods to overcome difficult environments, and a difficult environment will bring great help to overcome difficult environments. Today, "relieving needy children" will become the most active cause, and it is breeding a brand-new writing, which will write an immortal page in the history of needy children's relief.

Kind and benevolent people in society, kind and benevolent people who care for the home! The more than 260 innocent and pure children in the home are looking forward to your grand leadership of the "Relief of Needy Children" - generous donations. Your names and your great achievements will be gloriously written forever in the history of needy children and will be eternally engraved in the hearts of all needy children.

Pushan Villa

### Charitable Burial Achievements

Pushan Villa in this city is a well-known, pragmatic group dedicated to providing burial and covering up exposed bodies. Its founder, Mr. Wang Junsheng, gathered comrades and has been working diligently and unremittingly from the late Qing Dynasty to the present day. It has always been trusted by people in society, and funds have been continuously donated by various sectors, lasting for thirty years without decline. However, due to the excessive surge in the price of lumber in recent years, the financial aspect is still inevitably strained. As it celebrates its 30th anniversary, the villa plans to raise funds widely to enrich its finances, hoping that people from all walks of life will sympathize and be happy to help. The working situation of the villa up to 31 years is briefly recorded as follows: from the 2nd year of the Republic of China to the 31st year, a total of 662,604 large and small corpses and 90,119 skeletons have been collected. 261,522 large and small coffins and 86,404 urns have been provided. The above is based on the villa's annual work report.

Charity Sale to Help Students

### Diary on the Fourth Day

The second day, Saturday, October 9th, Wang Shouzhong returned from selling flower knots. Ã—Ã—Ã— said that he met the big movie star Mr. Ã— at the Great Light Theater today, "with a very large air." He hurried over to peddle. As a result, not only was he given the cold shoulder, but he was also scolded. He seemed very angry when he said this, so I couldn't help but comfort him. The saying "hard work is unrewarding" is evident here.

He also told me the best way to peddle flower knots. He said: When he finds his target and gets it, he rushes over to pick a flower knot that is most suitable for the person's identity and pins it on this gentleman, "Sir, would you like to donate and buy a student aid knot? We are the Youth Association's Boys' Department and the United Youth Group Badge - pointing to the group badge on his body! It is a student aid knot sold for the Shen Xin Two Newspaper's loan scholarship. This kind of knot is suitable for both men and women's clothes and hair. In fact, before I finish speaking, he will take out money and ask the price, and then I will complete my mission."

The fourth day, Sunday, October 10th, I followed the method taught by Ã—Ã—Ã— to sell student aid knots. Sure enough, the results were better than before. There were exceptions, but they were ultimately in the minority.

Ã—Ã—Ã— had a headache today, and Ã—Ã—Ã— said that his foot disease had recurred. This said that he would be scolded for being late, and that said that he would be deducted points by the school authorities for missing class. I comforted them one by one, saying, "This is the last day, everyone, work a little harder, and we will end tonight." They were all very obedient. I was happy for a while, and I was the first to work hard, so that the evening appointment with Pengfang was delayed. This warmth of friendship makes me feel less lonely. When I am alone, I often think that I have already helped many people invisibly. These people are all my friends who I have seen but do not know. I feel that our hard work is not without reward, and spiritual happiness is

Postscript

On Saturday the 16th of this month, everyone was free. Several responsible persons in our group went to the Baxianqiao Youth Association together with the Boys' Department staff and the representative of the Meilun Waterproof Fabric Manufacturing Co., Ltd. to count the boxes. The result was only more than 8,000 yuan, which was unexpected. Everyone was stunned. We estimated that the total would be over 10,000. How could there be only this much? Mr. Gu Haosheng saw what we meant and comforted us, saying, "Although the results of this council are certainly not the best, it's actually quite good for the first time." You only have about four and a half days, and you don't sell every day. The staff is also very clumsy. The time for selling flower knots often conflicts with homework. These are always a few points that limit the results of your fundraising from meeting the initial expectations, but the results cannot be considered unreasonable. Even if we are bad, we should be happy. Our happiness is built on helping others, and you should be happy about this enthusiasm!" After we were enlightened by him, we finally smiled a little. (The End)

For Those Selling Houses

### Beware of Scams

I am selling a friend's house on their behalf. Due to personal matters, I placed an advertisement in the Shen Xin Two Newspapers to sell it at a low price in order to resolve the matter as soon as possible. The next morning, a young man of about 25 or 26 years old, claiming to be surnamed Zhang, came to see the house. After contacting him, he quoted the lowest price for decoration costs. He immediately claimed to be a house broker and also dealt in stocks and real estate. He told me that there was a severe shortage of houses on the market and strongly advised against selling it at a low price. I told him that I was busy with store matters and did not want to profit. He then asked about the Huili Stock Exchange at No. 229 Daquan Building. The telephone number is 90647, but he forgot to bring his card and apologized. He said that the house was insured at a high price and could be sold. After the deal was completed, he asked for a reward. I declined repeatedly, but he refused to leave. Later, the house viewers helped contact him, but no deals were made. He took the opportunity to steal my wife's purse, which contained more than 200 yuan in pocket money and a small diamond ring. I didn't notice it at the time. When I discovered it, I went to the address and telephone number he left, but they were completely fake. That's when I realized I had been scammed. At the time, he was wearing a blue top and dark gray jacket, yellow leather shoes, and a flower. He had long hair, a thin face, a pointed chin, and was very eloquent, speaking in the Shanghai Pudong accent, supposedly from Chuansha, Pudong. I would like to inform everyone that if you are selling a house, please pay attention to this person, or something similar. If you find him, please monitor him closely to avoid being scammed.

### Impurities Analysis of Household Rice

â€” Xiaomin

The amount of household rice distributed in this city this month is still only one liter of coarse rice per person, which is far from meeting the minimum food needs of each person. Furthermore, the quality is poor. Last night, I picked out one bowl (approximately equal to four he) of coarse household rice from the 49th period and found the following five kinds of non-brown rice: 118 grains of millet and rotten rice, 420 seeds of ragweed, 76 grains of sand and mud, 4 small insects, and 1 tablespoon of red-picked rice (containing a large amount of sand powder). I think these impurities are not necessarily all mixed in by the rice shop. The authorities should not try to improve.
