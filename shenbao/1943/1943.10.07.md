### Real Politics and the People's Demands

Everywhere now, one can see and hear the slogans and banners of "Strengthening Sino-Japanese cooperation" and "Striving for the victory of the Greater East Asia War." Of course, these are all correct and are the greatest goals we should strive for today. However, if we truly want to achieve them, it is definitely not a matter of just shouting slogans and writing them down. First, we must examine the real politics. Only when the real politics are developing in this direction, are conducive to strengthening Sino-Japanese cooperation, and are conducive to striving for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, can there be practical results. Otherwise, if we ignore real politics and only sing slogans, everything will inevitably fall through.

Of course, the examination of real politics is not something that can be easily asserted. First, we must grasp the time factor. Time is merciless. It reflects the most truthful picture of human activities. No matter how good one is at embellishing, one cannot escape the test of time. Time is also the most realistic. Often, a certain policy may be considered appropriate at one time, but inappropriate at another. Also, what was once a bad policy may be considered a good policy at another time. Therefore, when we examine real politics, we must pay attention to the time factor. Second, we must grasp the spatial factor, that is, the geographical conditions, national conditions, and the uniqueness of the ethnic groups, because often what can be smoothly implemented and effective in country A may inevitably become incompatible in country B. What is a political policy that adapts to the demands of the people in place A may only increase the suffering of the people in place B and be difficult to achieve practical results. Third, we must also grasp the international factor, because the current war and the post-war new order construction are not only a total war in one country, but also a totalitarian war internationally, requiring the gathering of the total strength of various countries to strive for the realization of common goals. Therefore, when we examine real politics, if we only know the temporary convenience of our own country and ignore the common interests of the whole, we will naturally not be able to obtain correct conclusions. In addition to the above three major principles, of course, we must also adhere to the basic principles of discussing matters and not people, and valuing facts over emotions when examining. Otherwise, it is inevitable that "a slight deviation can lead to a great error."

Based on the above principles, let us try to examine the real politics in the peaceful areas. The most obvious defects seem to be the following. In terms of spirit, although there are many people in the peaceful area government who hold firm beliefs in the final success of the peace movement, to be honest, the vast majority lack correct beliefs. Most of them hold a kind of wrong idea, thinking that the current political situation in the peaceful area is definitely not long-lasting, and there will be another change in the near future. Based on this wrong concept, what is manifested in reality is: 1. They do not have a clear understanding of their responsibilities, thinking that they are just making a living and only thinking about their personal lives, so they lack a sense of responsibility. 2. They have a "five-day capital magistrate" mentality towards their duties. The upper ones "only seek to avoid mistakes and do not seek merit," and the lower ones adhere to the philosophy of muddling through, taking it one day at a time. 3. Since they have no belief in the future and only consider their personal interests, they inevitably use their power for personal gain and engage in corruption. Therefore, we dare to assert that if the belief in the success of peace is not established, then we cannot seek political clarity, and if politics is not clear, then all national policies will fall through.

Secondly, expert politics and clean politics are the prerequisites for a country's politics to get on the right track, and the National Government has always been working to promote its realization in this regard. However, based on the facts of the past few years, apart from some phenomena, it generally cannot fully meet the ideal. It is not only that, but there are also opposite facts! In terms of expert politics, to be honest, in the current peaceful area, most of those with real talent and solid reputation have not participated in politics. If we completely attribute this to such people having deep-seated prejudices and being unwilling to participate, we really cannot believe it. On the contrary, we see that as long as one can find connections and is good at speculation, one does not have to worry about not being able to become an official. As a result, the government is filled with a general group of ignorant and incompetent people. The upper ones create a bureaucratic political atmosphere, which is the main factor hindering political progress, and the lower ones inevitably spread the habits of the marketplace, taking pride in being good at seeking personal gain and regarding cunning and changeability as intelligence. Another greater reason is that the salaries received by general civil servants are not enough to support incorruptibility. People are not all sages, so it is unrealistic to expect what even sages cannot do. What is the use of constantly talking about eliminating corruption and practicing integrity?

Active political facilities are the basic elements for a country's politics to get on the right track. Therefore, grasping the hearts of the people, absorbing talents, and realizing national policies all depend on this. However, if we review the real politics in the peaceful area in recent years, how many of them can be called active and constructive political facilities? Of course, due to the existence of international and domestic wars, and due to the existence of special circumstances in various places, we have not made harsh demands on the government. However, from the proportion of all political facilities, passive facilities account for an absolutely large amount, while active facilities have almost no significant position. This often has a significant impact on the psychology of the people and the promotion of national policies.

The shortcomings of real politics often create a gap between the government and the people, hindering the implementation of national policies. The people's demands are originally very simple. The first, and also the most important, is to realize a life of peace and prosperity. The so-called life of peace and prosperity does not mean demanding enjoyment, but only demanding that politics get on the right track, that there be good politics, that the people's minimum living standards be guaranteed, and that work and careers can proceed normally. Second, it is to demand that the authorities pay special attention to production industries. For the sake of war, the people certainly have to abide by all regulations and restrictions, but what is especially important is to demand an increase in materials, first of all to demand the development of production industries. This is not only a prerequisite for improving people's livelihoods, but also a prerequisite for improving politics and implementing national policies. Third, the people have always been in a purely governed position, with no right to participate in politics and no room to express their opinions. Today, the people certainly do not want to realize constitutional government during the war, but how to realize local autonomy, how to establish public opinion institutions, how to maintain close ties between the people and the government, and how to create a new atmosphere of "officials and people as one" are the common demands of today.

Today, international situations and national realities do not need any high-sounding talk, but only demand that we pay attention to real politics, improve real politics, and satisfy the people's demands. Because only in this way can we realize the cooperation between the government and the people, can we realize the concentration of national power, can we demand the implementation of national policies, and can we talk about strengthening Sino-Japanese cooperation and striving for the victory of the Greater East Asia War.

### Japan Has Prepared a Favorable Posture for the Pacific War Situation, Shot Down Nine Enemy Planes That Attacked Bougainville

Central News Agency, Buenos Aires, 6th - According to a dispatch from London, the Undersecretary of the British Intelligence Department, Sattell, while attending the opening ceremony of the Military Exhibition here on the 5th, spoke about the future of the Pacific War, saying: The battle is raging in the Pacific, and the anti-Axis forces must recapture the vast tropical region from the hands of the Japanese. However, this is not easy. The Japanese army has occupied a vast area, and has prepared a favorable posture in terms of economy and strategy. Therefore, it will be difficult for the anti-Axis forces to recapture these areas even if they use all their strength.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th - According to a dispatch from a certain base in the South Pacific, the enemy air force in the South Pacific, on the 4th, used a joint formation of 58 aircraft, including unified B24 heavy bombers, BA33 long-range seaborne patrol interceptors, P38, P40, and F4W fighter-bombers, to attack the Japanese positions in the eastern part of Bougainville Island. The Japanese fighters immediately counterattacked fiercely, and immediately shot down five P38s, one E4w, and three B24s, for a total of nine (two of which were unconfirmed). In this battle, the Japanese army also lost one aircraft, but all the pilots were rescued.

Central News Agency, Argentina, 6th - According to a dispatch from Chicago, Jiang Telle, the head of the US war front inspection delegation, when passing through Chicago on his way to Washington after returning from China, met with a group of reporters and pointed out that the Pacific War is in danger of becoming a protracted war. He said: If the United States does not transfer sufficient reinforcements and start a general offensive on Makassar at this time, the Japanese front will become increasingly strengthened, and the Pacific War is in danger of becoming a protracted war. However, Britain not only does not provide sufficient assistance to the US military on the Pacific front, but also has no intention of starting an offensive on the China and Burma fronts. If Britain delays any longer, the United States will have to start the offensive in place of the British army. Jiang Telle also discussed the European war situation, saying briefly: It is impossible for the anti-Axis forces to invade Europe from the French coast.

### Japanese Army Launched an Annihilation War Near Guangde, Japanese Army Achieved Great Results in the Five Lakes Area

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th - The elite units of the Japanese army are currently launching an encirclement and annihilation war against the Chongqing "Loyal Patriotic Army" in the Taihu Lake area. After occupying Guangde, the base of the Chongqing army, its remnants have fallen into the encirclement. Currently, with the northern foot of Sanshou Mountain as the center, fierce annihilation wars are being launched everywhere. The fate of 30,000 Chongqing soldiers is in danger. After the Japanese rapid unit occupied Guangde on the night of the 2nd, it swept away the remnants in the vicinity on the 3rd and 4th, and completely destroyed the Chongqing military facilities. Other units advanced from the north and the west of Taihu Lake, completely encircling Wu Shi'an of the Second Advance Team and a part of the Fourth Team of the Chongqing forces. Starting from the morning of the 4th, the eastern troops compressed the encirclement southward, giving the enemy a devastating blow. Another unit arrived on the south side of Guangde on the 3rd, and continued its fierce attack on the 4th. In the afternoon of the same day, the Chongqing army in a certain place was surrounded, completing the outer encirclement of the encirclement circle, and a fierce annihilation war is currently underway. Another unit echoed this and forced itself behind Guangde, sweeping the area near Wangling (15 kilometers south of Guangde), where the headquarters of the "Loyal Patriotic Army" is located, and Longkou Village (8 kilometers south of Guangde). The Chongqing army was surrounded on all sides by the Japanese army, and has become rats in a bag, in extreme embarrassment.

Central News Agency, A Certain Place on the Chinese Front, 6th - The elite units of the Japanese army previously attacked 30,000 members of the Chongqing Loyal Patriotic Army in the Five Lakes area, and on the 5th, continued to compress the encirclement and annihilate the defeated Chongqing army everywhere, giving them individual blows. In particular, the Japanese rapid unit that captured Guangde urgently pursued the enemy army, once occupied Sian Town, and the Japanese units advancing from Wuhu towards Shangpeibu are currently suppressing a part of the 16th Brigade of the New Fourth Army that is waiting for an opportunity to launch. A certain unit of the Japanese army is carrying out suppression in Liyang, so the Five Lakes area will be gradually brightened and improved as the Japanese army's operations progress.

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th - According to reports from the Japanese front in Jiangnan, the new operation launched by the Japanese army in the Five Lakes area has now reached its climax. Guangde, an important base of the Chongqing army, has been occupied. This operation has made many contributions to the construction of the New China, enabling the government's political power to be extended, promoting the Qingxiang (Pacification) work, and obtaining resources, which is worthy of attention. According to the security of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, thanks to the past Qingxiang work of the National Government and the continuous implementation of suppression operations by the Japanese army, it has been able to maintain a good condition, but the Chongqing army still seizes opportunities from time to time to engage in espionage work. Recently, its actions have become increasingly active, causing the lives of farmers in the vicinity to become uneasy, which has hindered the government's efforts to extend its political power. However, due to this operation, these restless areas have been completely suppressed. The security of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River will soon be rapidly restored, and the stability of the people's livelihood in the Five Lakes area is worthy of expectation. At the same time, the Qingxiang work implemented by the government in Zhejiang Province can also be rapidly advanced due to this operation. Moreover, the resources and agricultural products in this area, such as rice, wheat, and cotton, are the richest in Central China, so the supply of food and materials can be expected in the future. In addition, the circulation of materials is also gradually becoming active. Moreover, the reserves of iron and coal in this area are also quite abundant, so the operation area will soon become a resource treasure for China and Japan during the war. The harvest from this operation is indeed great.

### Japanese Army's War Results on Hainan Island Last Month

### Deputy Finance Minister Chen Zhishuo Talks to Reporters

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th - Deputy Minister of Finance Chen Zhishuo recently answered questions from the Central News Agency reporters in detail as follows: Starting in October, Japanese nationals will pay taxes to the National Government in accordance with regulations. May I ask what is the amount of this tax revenue? Answer: Japanese nationals have been paying various taxes in accordance with our country's tax laws since October 1st, which is of great significance to the integrity of our country's national rights, and good results are expected. As for the tax revenue figures, they will be calculated after they are transferred to the ministry. May I ask how the Executive Yuan's announcement of the method of restricting the collection of taxes and levies in various provinces and cities will benefit the rural economy? Answer: Since the National Government returned to the capital in the 29th year of the Republic of China, this ministry has requested the Executive Yuan to abolish the harsh taxes and levies in various places, and the ministry has supervised and directed the implementation, and instructed compliance. However, if there are cases of levies at the lower levels, this ministry will correct them in a timely manner. As for the Executive Yuan's announcement of the method of restricting the collection of taxes and levies in various provinces and cities this time, it was originally intended to pay attention to people's livelihood, and it will greatly benefit the rural economy. It is attached that, regarding land taxes, this ministry drafted the Provisional Regulations on the Collection of Land Taxes in Various Provinces and Cities during the Extraordinary Period last December. All tax amounts are stipulated to be 1% of the current land price. All land tax surcharges or enemy donations, and all other surcharges, are suspended. This was approved by the Executive Yuan and notified for compliance. The Provisional Measures for Supervising Local Finance and the Implementing Rules thereof were promulgated in April of the 18th year and August of the 22nd year and are still being implemented. After the Central Reserve Bank and the United Bank signed the third remittance contract, the circulation of finance between the north and the south has benefited greatly. May I ask whether this method is temporary in nature, and whether the north-south currency problem will be further integrated as a result? Answer: The nature of the remittance contract signed by the Central Reserve Bank and the United Bank is to facilitate the circulation of finance between the north and the south and to meet actual needs. It cannot be described as a temporary measure, nor is it appropriate to predetermine the implementation period. However, the circulation of currency will inevitably be further advanced, without saying more.

### Sino-Japanese Cultural Communication Has Entered the Right Track, The Two Countries Decided to Exchange Writers for the First Time

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th - At the current stage, Sino-Japanese cultural communication has gradually entered the right track. The two countries have decided to exchange first-class writers and new scholars for the first time, but this move was not decided at the Second Congress of Writers. Cases that have not been resolved for decades or even hundreds of years will be gradually resolved here, so its meaning is profound and significant. The Japan Literary Patriotic Society is responsible for the selection of personnel and other negotiations. The Japanese writers to be sent to China have been internally decided as Abe Tomoji, Oda Takeo, Kubota Mantaro, and Hayashi Hideo. Shanghai is planning to include Yoshino Nobuko and Mafune Mitsuo. Beijing is planning to include six people, and at least one more person will be sent to Shanghai and Beijing as a permanent resident. The first-class personnel sent to Japan by China for the first time are Tao Kangde and Xu Bailin, both of whom are new Chinese writers who attended the Second Congress of Writers, and both are currently in Tokyo. Tao Kangde is studying Japanese general culture, and Xu is specializing in Chinese studies at the Tokyo Imperial University Research Institute. In addition to the exchange of writers, it was also decided to exchange Sino-Japanese cultural researchers at the same time. The Japanese side sent Kiyomizu Shin, a graduate of the Department of Literature of Meiji University, to Beijing for research. The Chinese side sent Xu Shouzhong and Song Guiying, graduates of the Faculty of Arts of Peking University, who are about to come to Japan. In addition, Kume Masao, the secretary-general of the Japan Literary Patriotic Society, is scheduled to go to China on the 20th of this month to handle the exchange of these scholars and prepare for the Writers' Congress to be held next year. The trip will last about a week.

### Head of the Thai Military Delegation Expresses His Impressions of Visiting Japan

Central News Agency, Bangkok, 6th - The head of the Thai military delegation to Japan, Lieutenant General Pechide, specially met with the Japanese press corps here on the morning of the 5th to express his impressions of the trip as follows: The main purpose of this visit to Japan was to inspect the military of the friendly nation, but I believe that not only military matters, but all matters are intended to use this trip to enhance cooperation and kinship with Japan. During the time in Japan, I was warmly welcomed and generously entertained by Japanese people from all over the country. I was particularly grateful. During my stay in Tokyo for about two weeks, I met with Prime Minister Tojo and the heads of the Japanese army and navy to exchange various opinions. In addition, I also visited various military factories in detail. What impressed me most when visiting the Japanese military industry was that Japan is determined not to rely on foreign forces for this holy war. The materials and technology are all self-sufficient. In particular, after visiting the aircraft factory and the shipyard, I deeply felt that I had full confidence in the massive production capacity of Japanese industry. I also got to see the manufacturing situation of a certain warship. Also, when I visited the Akino Aviation School, I saw that the combat training of Japanese army pilots was most commendable. This training exercise was entirely for air combat. On the way back, I visited the battlefields of Malaysia and the Southern Islands. When I recalled the spirit of bravery and the heart-stirring battle results of the Japanese army in this Greater East Asia War, I could not help but sigh. In short, this trip made me more confident in Japan's military strength, and I deeply felt that I would fight together with Japan to the final victory, and I was deeply confident in the victory of this war.

### Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam Writes on Foreign Relations; Vietnam Actively Pursues Cotton Production Increase

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - "Yomiuri Shimbun" recently published an article by Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam, titled "Vietnam in East Asia," the main points of which are as follows: Vietnam's foreign relations, especially its relations with Asian neighbors, have been deeply affected since the outbreak of this World War. In fact, Vietnam's communication with Europe and the United States has been cut off, but its political machinery has not changed as a result. Vietnam's culture and economy have close ties with East Asian countries, and these ties are becoming increasingly close. The restoration of trade between civilized countries around the world must meet all the conditions for progress, which is well known to us. It is expected that when global trade is restored, it will not hinder trade between East Asian nations and this region, but rather promote it. Therefore, I believe that Vietnam's current situation is very clear. The Governor-General's Office of Vietnam is determined to protect and secure the happiness of Annam, which constitutes the Indochina Union, in the name of France. Therefore, Vietnam adopts an independent attitude, but this does not mean isolation, because Vietnam has cooperated with Japan as a member of East Asia to build a new order in Greater East Asia. At the same time, the Governor-General's Office of Vietnam is determined to be loyal to the French government and to fulfill its promises to Japan. It is expected that political cooperation with Japan will yield supreme results, and this spirit of cooperation will be fully demonstrated in the economic field. When this economic agreement is implemented, Vietnam will export a large number of various materials to East Asia, especially to Japan, mainly rice and corn. The price Vietnam receives will be used to supply materials that are insufficient domestically. However, during this wartime, although Japan wants to supply as much as possible to Vietnam, it is not very smooth. This is indeed a major problem. To solve this problem, it is necessary to enhance Vietnam's productivity. Therefore, today, Vietnam not only needs to make up for its own material shortages but should also strive to produce for the entire Greater East Asia. Currently, Vietnam is working hard to produce fuel for engines and alternative lubricating oils. Secondly, regarding Vietnam's increased cotton production, the raw materials necessary for general clothing should be supplied to industrial and handicraft workers in various regions. In addition to increasing agricultural production, Vietnam also needs to strive to manufacture industrial products. Significant results have been achieved in the production of lubricating oil, alcohol, and dissolving oil. At the same time, investigations have begun on the production of chemical products and chemicals, and research is being conducted on important materials in Vietnam. Because the quantity is limited, strict regulations must be set for their utilization. A distribution system has been adopted for imported materials. In summary, Vietnam is now working hard to cooperate with the war and has adopted comprehensive countermeasures to use general mechanisms, fully exploit Vietnam's resource capabilities, improve the living standards of the people, and seek prosperity in both material and spiritual aspects. This is also the mission that Vietnam owes to its motherland, France.

Saigon, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Vietnamese authorities and the local Japanese military authorities have conducted various studies on the issue of establishing a self-sufficient system in Vietnam. In terms of Vietnam's objective conditions, it has been confirmed that increasing cotton production is the key to solving this problem. According to statistics, Vietnam exported 50 million tons of cotton yarn in 1913. Unfortunately, it failed to compete with American and Egyptian cotton, and production gradually decreased. Before this World War, it was reduced to the minimum quantity. However, according to past statistics, the Vietnamese cotton industry is still promising. Therefore, the authorities are now preparing to actively increase production, expand the planting area, and implement concrete measures such as increasing cotton prices.

### Twenty-Three Enemy Aircraft Attack Ambon Unsuccessfully

Ambon, 6th (Central News Agency) - On the night of October 2nd, 23 enemy aircraft attacked Ambon. Due to extremely bad weather, they failed to drop bombs and fled.

### German Army Builds a Back-to-the-River Defense Line Along the Dnieper River; Launches Fierce Counterattack Along the Entire Front

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to Captain Seiltlitz, a well-known German military commentator, who spoke on the evening of the 5th about the Eastern Front, the German High Command has decided to stop retreating after the German army reaches the Dnieper River.

Argentine City, 6th (Central News Agency) - After the German military authorities announced the end of the retreat on the Eastern Front, they built a back-to-the-river defense line along the Dnieper River and launched a fierce counterattack along the entire front, not allowing the Soviet army to advance a single step. The situation on the Dnieper River has fallen into a stalemate. The Soviet army's official newspaper, "Red Star," admitted to the large-scale German counterattack and hoped that the Soviet soldiers would rise up, saying that if the German counterattack is not repelled, the Soviet army's offensive efforts will not succeed. According to German sources, there is still fierce fighting on the Smolensk-Vitebsk highway, and it is reported that the German army has broken into the Soviet army's position at that location.

Both Armies Fight to the Death for Bridgeheads

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: Although the general situation in the war zones west of Smolensk and northwest of Temidov remains unchanged, the German army fighting in the area made further progress on land on Monday, especially after fierce hand-to-hand combat, the Soviet army's counterattacks were repelled several times. Fierce fighting broke out again along both sides of the Orsha-Smolensk highway. The Soviet army attacked and broke through several local gaps, but the German reserves quickly filled them. German artillery and aircraft cooperated to destroy the Soviet columns in progress, making a great contribution to the war in the area. There was more activity on the northern part of the Eastern Front on Monday, especially south of Lake Ilmen, where the Soviet army was frequently mobilized and effectively bombarded by the German army. On the Volkhov Front, the Soviet army's daring attacks by powerful shock troops were detected and suppressed by the German army in time. South of Lake Ladoga, the Soviet army attempted to block the German army's efforts to straighten the line of defense but was repelled by the German army and failed to achieve its goal. At the same time, German reconnaissance teams reported that the enemy was reorganizing its forces near the front line north of the Sea of Azov. Disregarding the heavy losses suffered in the previous days, the Soviet army is clearly planning to launch another offensive.

Improvement of German Positions in the South

South of Melitopol, the German army repelled the Soviet army's offensive and captured a mountain fortress, thus greatly improving its position. Another offensive launched by the Soviet army on the northern wing of the Melitopol bridgehead was thwarted under the heavy artillery fire of the German defense. Although the Chaplyuk bridgehead was the site of activity on Sunday evening, it was not attacked by the Soviet army on Monday. However, fierce fighting took place northwest of Niepropetrovsk, where one side of the river was heavily bombarded on the evening of that day. The Soviet army landed reinforcements on the opposite bank of the Dnieper River in an attempt to recover the territory previously lost. Fierce fighting took place all night, but the Soviet army did not gain an inch. The Soviet army also repeatedly attempted to secure new bridgeheads and landing points along a front of hundreds of kilometers between the central Dnieper River and the mouth of the Pripyat River, but all attempts were thwarted. A group of German forces, including tanks and mechanized units, occupied the town of Chernobyl in the Pripyat River estuary lowlands and also crossed the river to defend its bridgehead. The Soviet army's repeated attacks failed. The new defensive successes achieved by the German army on the Taman Peninsula were even more significant, because on Monday the Soviet army launched several infantry divisions and a tank brigade in an attempt to break through the German army's main line of defense. However, due to the small war zone, it was unable to deploy its forces and had to attack the German position in dense formations. The German army suffered heavy losses and did not give up its attempt, but the enemy's fierce attack finally collapsed under German artillery fire and German air raids.

German Army Strategically Utilizes Time Factor on Eastern Front

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to the Havas News Agency, Lieutenant General Dittmar, a German military expert, gave a speech on the limits of the German army's avoidance of battle on the Eastern Front, stating that not only are favorable natural terrains necessary, but also convenience for future actions. The shortening of transportation lines and the dense network of rivers and marshes in western Russia are favorable conditions for stabilizing the situation. After several days of fierce attacks, the Soviet army has suffered extremely heavy losses and its strength has weakened. In addition, we are using a scorched-earth policy to deal with those who once taught us this method, but this is not a decisive factor. The shortening of the front line must be premised on the balance between one's own military strength and the other side's military strength and the length of its transportation lines. For the past two years, the German army on the Eastern Front has been fighting with fewer troops against more, especially in recent months. The Soviet side has launched a fierce offensive with all its forces this summer, and its number of soldiers is many times greater than ours, but since they were assembled in a short period of time, training is inevitably somewhat lacking. After more than two years of arduous combat, the German army has penetrated deep into enemy territory and still holds a favorable position for offense and defense. The battles in Eastern and Southern Europe fully demonstrate the German army's perseverance. Whether the acquisition of the time factor is beneficial depends on whether the acquirer can make good use of it. Whether in Eastern or Southern Europe, Germany is fighting for time, and is also making good use of this time to develop its amazing scientific talents in exchange for concrete achievements in battle.

### Strong German Defenses on the East Coast of the Adriatic Sea; Anti-Axis Aircraft Attack Greece Unsuccessfully

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - As the war in southern Italy progresses, the anti-Axis forces are carrying out landing operations in Albania and Greece. The German military authorities issued a statement on the 6th to explain the strength of the German front line in that area, stating that the eastern Adriatic region, especially within Greece and Albania facing the Strait of Otranto, has become stable due to the strong operations of the German army. Since the German army recently occupied various island cities, the occupied area has been further expanded, and the cooperation of the Albanian natives with the German army has remained unwavering.

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - The German Air Force authorities announced on the 6th that anti-Axis air forces attacked German air bases in Greece on the 5th. German fighter squadrons immediately intercepted them, shooting down seven heavy bombers with four engines. The enemy aircraft fled without reaching their destination.

### British Forces Advance on the Plains on the East Coast of Italy; Encounter Fierce Attacks by German Forces

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to military reporter Cetorius of the Havas News Agency, there were no major changes in the war situation on the four fronts of southern Italy on the previous day. The enemy forces apparently dispatched troops from the Naples area to prepare for continued advancement. The enemy's vanguard was blocked by the German rearguard on the plains between Naples and Volturno. The right wing of the American Fifth Army in the interior intensified its northward attack, attempting to cross Benevento. The American tank corps still encountered difficulties in the mountainous areas, and the German rearguard prevented the enemy from advancing, preventing them from exceeding the speed predetermined by the German High Command. The right wing of the British Eighth Army advanced northward and reached the town of Batolomio. A portion of the British Eighth Army in the middle turned westward, where the war situation was not fierce. The British forces advancing along the Adriatic coastal plain and the British forces landing near Termoli were attacked by the German army. The enemy clearly wanted to encircle by landing north of Termoli, and the war situation there deserves special attention.

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - A formation of fast fighter-bombers of the Air Force launched a fierce bombing raid on the British bridgehead of Termoli on the east coast of Italy on the 4th, causing great damage to the landing facilities and landing craft, and destroying four heavy artillery pieces.

US Fifth Army's Northern Advance Obstructed

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: On Monday, the battle in southern Italy was primarily focused on troops stationed on the eastern coast and near the Apennine Mountains. West of this area, as far as the lowlands of Campania, military actions were limited to small skirmishes between German rearguard units and British and American reconnaissance squads. The enemy's attempt to break through the German lines between Benevento and Volturara was completely unsuccessful. The enemy is still facing the wide and deep German defense zone. The German army is moving to higher mountainous areas according to plan, and has not been obstructed by the British and American forces. The German rearguard units ordered to withdraw from Benevento prevented the enemy from creating any gaps in the German lines. In this military action, the powerful American reconnaissance squad suffered heavy losses, especially southwest of Benevento in locations such as Telese Terme and Airola. The enemy planned to pass through the highway leading to the lowlands of Campania, but after losing approximately 500 armored reconnaissance vehicles and a large number of soldiers, they retreated in disarray. After making no gains in other areas, the British Eighth Army intensified its efforts to advance eastward. Localized fierce battles broke out in the Foggia lowlands and the mountainous and coastal areas. East of Volturara, east of Larino, and near the coast of Termoli, the British army intensified its offensive, and the German army put up a strong resistance. The Canadian troops fighting near Volturara stopped their attempt to break through after losing four "Sherman" tanks and suffering heavy casualties. Under the cover of tanks, the British army attempted to advance east of Larino, but was met with a German flanking attack. Their vanguard units were subjected to accurate German fire, resulting in many casualties.

Sweeping Operations Behind the Lines Yield Results

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: The German army's mopping-up operation in northern Italy has been a great success. In the Trieste area, 13,000 guerrillas were captured. In the past three days of operations, 1,100 guerrillas have been killed on the battlefield in Istria. Many of Badoglio's subordinates have been killed or captured. The German army has also seized many light and heavy weapons, as well as motorcycles, fuel depots, mountain guns, and anti-aircraft guns that were formerly owned by the Italian army and had recently been surrendered or delivered to the hands of the insurgents. The mopping-up operation is now progressing towards the coast, and the mopping-up operation in the Slovenian region has also been very successful. Clearing the mountains and transportation lines was successful on Sunday and eliminated many guerrillas.

### German Troops Landing on Kos Island Launch Sweeping Operations

One Anti-Axis Cargo Ship Sunk

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to Havas News Agency, German military circles announced yesterday that after German troops landed on and occupied Kos Island, north of the Dodecanese Islands, on October 4th, they began sweeping operations, which are still in progress. In addition to capturing 600 British soldiers and 2,500 Badoglio troops, the German army seized 40 artillery pieces, 11 aircraft, and one ship, and another 11 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground.

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - Military circles announced last night that German bombers patrolling the southern Aegean Sea on Monday discovered an anti-Axis cargo ship of approximately 4,500 tons. They immediately attacked the ship, causing it to catch fire and suffer heavy damage. The ship attempted to take refuge in a bay on a small island in the Dodecanese Islands, but was eventually hit several times and caught fire. It was quickly enveloped in thick smoke, and it can be presumed that it has been lost. At the same time, German anti-aircraft units in the Aegean region also shot down three anti-Axis bombers on Monday.

German Troop Withdrawal from Corsica and Sardinia

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - Within 18 days, German transport planes and naval vessels evacuated approximately 30,000 German troops from Sardinia and Corsica to Italy, along with 16,000 tons of military supplies, 6,000 transport vehicles, and many other artillery pieces and tanks. All of the evacuated forces were used to reinforce the German front line in Italy. During the withdrawal, the German army suffered only 250 deaths, and lost 25 transport planes and a small number of transport ships.

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a naval reporter from Havas News Agency, the German army's withdrawal from Corsica and Sardinia has been completed. All German troops dispatched to those islands to assist the Italian army have now safely returned to the Italian mainland with all of their war equipment and supplies. The task of transporting the German troops back to the Italian mainland was undertaken by the German army. The German Navy, with its ingenious tactics, finally solved this extremely difficult problem. The mutiny of Badoglio's government made it impossible for the German troops stationed on Corsica and Sardinia to remain there for a single day. The German High Command, faced with the sudden changes in the situation in the Mediterranean, decisively abandoned Corsica and Sardinia. The withdrawal operation began with Sardinia. The German armored division and other units stationed on the island boarded small ships and sailed across the narrow Strait of Bonifacio. The attempt by Italian destroyers to prevent the passage of the ships completely failed. One Italian destroyer was damaged by German coastal artillery. The withdrawal from Sardinia was completely successful in nine days, which is due to the skill of German Rear Admiral Jürgen, who had previously solved the transportation problem during the North African campaign and achieved great success. The passage of ships across the Strait of Bonifacio was only interrupted once, but the withdrawal was successfully completed on September 17. The withdrawal from Corsica was more difficult than the withdrawal from Sardinia. The treacherous waves of the Mediterranean presented a considerable obstacle to the withdrawal operation, and only a small number of Italian ships were available for dispatch. Italian crew members leaving the ships had to be replaced by German crew members, and all of the difficulties were resolved by the German authorities. Although German transport ships were attacked by submarines and other warships en route, they eventually arrived in Italy. The German troops suffered no losses when boarding ships in Bastia and landing at ports in Italy.

### Anti-Axis Aircraft Attack Germany; Forty Aircraft Shot Down

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to announcements last night, anti-Axis aircraft attacked Frankfurt, Offenbach, Duisburg, and Worms on Monday and the same evening. Forty-one aircraft were shot down, most of which were heavy bombers. The situation in Frankfurt was quite serious. Residential areas and public buildings were damaged. Three children's hospitals and other hospitals were destroyed, and one hundred and fifty children were buried in the rubble.

### Pope Not Captured

Delhi, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to Havas News Agency, Cardinal Segura in Seville publicly declared to over a thousand people that he, as one of the cardinals in Spain, often communicates with the Pope, and knows for sure that the Pope has not been captured by soldiers. Catholics do not need to pray in question, the Pope has recovered his freedom, as for the collective prayer of Catholics to restore peace as soon as possible, he does not oppose it.

### Military Supplies Ministry and Production Administration (2)

What kind of content and character the newly established Military Supplies Ministry will possess depends on the cooperation between the government and the people in the future, and cannot be predicted at present. At this time, it may be somewhat meaningful for us to examine the production administrative organizations of Germany, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and to review the entity of the Military Supplies Ministry's organization. Of course, due to the significant differences in national conditions and production circumstances, it should be remembered that the organization of any country cannot be completely transferred to Japan as is.

### Germany

The Allied nation of Germany convened the Supreme National Defense Council, also known as the War Cabinet, at the end of August 1939. This was the highest deliberative body concerning the war economy. Marshal Göring, the head of the Four-Year Plan, was appointed chairman. The members included Interior Minister Frick (recently reassigned), Economic Minister Funk, the Führer's representative (currently vacant), General Superintendent of the Armed Forces Keitel, and Head of the Reich Chancellery Lammers, totaling five members. Their task was to coordinate the economic, political, and military aspects of the war. An affiliated body of the Supreme National Defense Council was the Supreme Council for War Economy (established in December 1939), chaired by Marshal Göring, with Korner, the Deputy Commissioner of the Four-Year Plan, as acting chairman. The deputy ministers of the Ministries of Economy, Food, Labor, Transportation, and Interior, the deputy director of the Central Forestry Bureau, members of the Price Review Committee, the director of the Quartermaster General's Department of the Armed Forces, and party representatives served as members. Its goal was to streamline the operation of the war economy. Thus, Marshal Göring, in his capacity as the head of the Four-Year Plan, held full authority over the economic system and also served as chairman of both the Supreme National Defense Council and the Supreme Council for War Economy, thereby occupying the position of commander-in-chief of the war economy.

### Contents of the Four-Year Plan

To realistically exercise the full authority he had acquired, the head of the Four-Year Plan established the Central Planning Board within the Four-Year Plan Office as the highest executive body, appointing Minister of Armaments Speer, Deputy Commissioner of the Four-Year Plan Korner, and Deputy Air Minister Milch as members. The tasks of the board were to:

Determine the outline for the allocation of raw materials and resources,

Determine the materials that should be prioritized for production,

Determine the sectors in the basic materials industry and processing industry that should be expanded.

The actual power of the board rested with Minister of Armaments Speer, so the Minister of Armaments held the position of operating the war economy with direct authority as the head of the Four-Year Plan. The Minister of Armaments began to attract the attention of the general public from this point onward. The German Minister of Armaments (correctly speaking, the initial title was Minister of Weapons and Munitions) was appointed by a Führer decree on March 17, 1940. The first minister was Dr. Todt, the General Inspector of German Road Construction.

His task was to maximize the efficiency of all organizations engaged in the production of weapons and ammunition, and to implement supervision of the production of military supplies for the purpose of overall control. The Minister of Armaments had full authority to issue all necessary orders in the execution of his duties. As a result, the relevant agencies of military officers were placed under the command of the Minister of Armaments (appointing managing officers of the Armaments Ministry where necessary). Changes in personnel in organizations involved in the production of military supplies required the consent of the Minister of Armaments, and it was also stipulated that the relevant agencies had an obligation to provide all necessary reports at the request of the Minister of Armaments. However, at the beginning of the appointment of the Minister of Armaments, the allocation of military supplies was under the jurisdiction of the Quartermaster General's Department of the Armed Forces, and the planning of raw materials was under the jurisdiction of the Four-Year Plan Office. General economic administration was under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Armaments, so the authority of the Minister of Armaments was not necessarily very strong. Later, in a certain month, the Minister of Armaments suddenly died in the line of duty. After Speer took office, with the establishment of the Central Planning Board, the authority of the Minister of Armaments was greatly expanded. He maintained contact with the Four-Year Plan Office through the board, and conversely, the Quartermaster General's Department of the Armed Forces (headed by General Thomas) was placed under the command of the Ministry of Armaments. Thus, all authority regarding military production was concentrated in his hands.

After Speer was appointed as the plenipotentiary for military production under the new Four-Year Plan, the authority of Economic Minister Funk, who was in charge of civil production, was temporarily and clearly divided. The authority and position of the Minister of Armaments were generally as described above, but on September of this year, it was greatly reformed again. Civil production, which was under the jurisdiction of Economic Minister Funk, was also placed under the direct control of the Minister of Armaments. Speer took charge of all military and civil production, and as a result, the title was formally changed to Minister of Armaments and Production, and he was appointed as the plenipotentiary commissioner of the Four-Year Plan.

At the same time, Economic Minister Funk was responsible for foreign trade, goods distribution, the commercial sector, and the financial sector, and participated in the Central Planning Board.

Thus, Minister of Armaments Speer is now the de facto commander of German military production. He is relatively young, not yet forty years old, and was formerly an architect. In addition to the aforementioned Armaments Bureau and Armaments Supervisory Office, the lower-level organizations of the Ministry of Armaments include:

Armaments Advisory Council—composed of five representatives from the Army and Navy, and representatives from civil society organizations, to advise the ministers.

Production Guidance Bureau—mobilizes production groups and guides committee regional executive officers, military administrative regions, and central technical committees to cooperate in organizing and undertaking production guidance. "Production groups" are established in each industry as self-governing production groups for business operators. The guidance committee members, who are the heads, are appointed by the government, and have achieved great results in improving production efficiency and technology. Regional executive officers and military administrative region executive officers are government supervisors, and the Central Technical Committee is a self-governing cooperative body for operators in the technical field.

General Affairs Bureau—responsible for liaison between departments.

The above-mentioned production group system, with the goal of establishing the "national character of enterprises," is of considerable reference value to our country. In short, the administrative organization of German production, with Hitler-Göring-Speer as the heads, is characterized by a concentrated, monolithic, and unique authority of the state.

### Soviet Union

Similarly, the administrative organization of production in the Soviet Union, also a monolithic state, is structured around a council system. The Soviet Union does not have a specific agency called the Ministry of Armaments. Many People's Commissariats related to industry are established in parallel. In order to control these many People's Commissariats, six industrial councils were established. The upper-level organization of these industrial councils is the Economic Council established in 1937, which has its current structure due to the reorganization in January 1940. The members of the Economic Council are as follows:

Chairman—Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Stalin. Vice-Chairman—Vice-Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars. Members—Chairman of the Defense Committee (Voroshilov), People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, People's Commissar for Transportation, People's Commissar for Foreign Trade, Procurator General, Chairmen of the industrial councils, and Secretary-General of Labor Organizations.

The Economic Council belongs to the Council of People's Commissars of the Union (Cabinet), reviews the annual plans of the national economy, confirms various group review plans, and supervises and directs the operation of the economy. Based on these tasks, together with the State Planning Committee, which serves as a planning organization, it can be regarded as the central driving force of the war economy.

In this way, the Federal Council of People's Commissars—Economic Council—Industrial Councils—People's Commissars, and many other administrative bodies are established to be responsible for military production. Among these, the Industrial Councils are composed of three to five members. Members are not allowed to hold concurrent posts other than wartime duties in the State Planning Committee. The chairman and vice-chairman are selected from the deputy chairmen (twelve in total) of the People's Commissars. Each council has a special General Administration Bureau. The contents of the Industrial Councils are as follows:

### Contents of the Industrial Councils

Industrial Council for Metals and Chemicals (People's Commissariats for non-ferrous metals industry, ferrous metals industry, and chemical industry, and the General Administration Bureau for Sulfite, Alcohol, and Hydrolysis Industries)

Industrial Council for Machinery Manufacturing (People's Commissariats for large machinery manufacturing, general machinery manufacturing, and electrical industry).

Industrial Council for Defense Industry (People's Commissariats for aviation industry, weapons manufacturing, ammunition manufacturing, and shipbuilding industry).

Industrial Council for Fuel and Energy Economy (People's Commissariats for the petroleum industry, coal industry, power generation industry, and fuel industry).

Industrial Council for Daily Necessities and Consumer Goods (People's Commissariats for textiles industry, garment industry, food industry, dairy industry, and fisheries industry).

Industrial Council for Agriculture and Procurement (People's Commissariats for agriculture and procurement). (From: Asahi Shimbun, four sections on October 1)

Even the sugar needed by various industries will be reduced according to the nature of their business. The office is currently making adjustments and will submit them to the authorities for review before continuing the distribution. However, there are many special allocation customers, so it will be delayed until mid-month before distribution can be carried out in turn.

### Zhou Huarren Talks about the Affairs Bureau of the Cultural Association

Central News Agency report: Zhou Huarren, who is in charge of the Shanghai branch of the China-Japan Cultural Association after its reorganization, said: After the reorganization of this branch, its organization and work policies have been slightly changed compared to before. This branch has now adopted the affairs bureau system, with the general affairs, management, business planning, and other departments clearly defined, and the power is centralized. In the past, this branch rarely had any contact with society. In the future, cultural undertakings should be integrated with social life. In the future, all Chinese and Japanese cultural figures and artists should be solicited to join this branch and take joint responsibility. Now that the municipality has been unified, we should thoroughly eliminate the cultural ideas of Anglo-American liberal capitalism, establish cultural ideas based on East Asia, promote the communication between Chinese and Japanese cultures, promote the inherent culture of the East, and create a new culture of East Asia as the guiding principles. In short, under the leadership of Chairman Chen, the cultural circles of Shanghai will inevitably become more united and move towards the goals set in the reorganization declaration. We hope that the press will provide guidance from time to time.

### Renji Hall: Operating for Over Sixty Years, A Classical Charitable Institution

Near the modernized Rue Edward VII, on the ordinary Yunnan Road, among the uneven array of shops large and small, stands a tall, temple-like old building. This is the renowned, nationally recognized, classical Chinese charitable organization—the Shanghai Renji Charitable Hall.

Sixty-One Years Ago

Stepping into the tall entrance, one sees the main hall and the second hall, which display the architectural art of China's recent past, especially the plaques, which evoke feelings of nostalgia. There is also the inscription of the three large characters "Renji Hall" written by Yu Yue (Quyuan). Mr. Xu Rusheng, who is currently in charge of the affairs of the hall, tells a truly captivating story about its history.

It was sixty-one years ago that a "Civilization Bureau" appeared near the Hong Temple on today's Nanjing Road. This was the predecessor of the Shanghai Renji Charitable Hall. The Civilization Bureau was engaged in social welfare undertakings, and its main tasks were: first, the cleaning movement of "cherishing and respecting written paper"; second, the children's enlightenment movement of opening "free schools"; and third, the public propaganda (moral persuasion) movement of holding "village covenants"; in addition, it was also dedicated to charitable undertakings such as caring for the poor and widows. In general, it was worthy of the name "Civilization Bureau" in its literal meaning.

At that time, charitable undertakings in Shanghai were still in a primitive state, mainly relying on the charitable words and deeds of individual philanthropists. There was no organization to speak of, and naturally no undertaking to speak of. However, the establishment of the Civilization Bureau gave Shanghai society a considerable stimulus. Because it met the actual needs of society, it gradually became necessary to expand the scope of its affairs. Therefore, it soon moved from Nanjing Road to North Sea Road and was renamed "Zhonghe Bureau," which was considerably larger. At the same time, it opened a free dispensary and pharmacy, becoming the largest provider of aid to the poor in Shanghai at that time.

The "Zhonghe Bureau's" charitable undertakings not only earned the gratitude of the general public, but also gained the trust of benevolent people, who believed that organized and planned charity was far more meaningful than individual and random acts of kindness. As a result, the amount of donations increased day by day. The leaders at the time, encouraged by this support from all walks of life, further enhanced their belief in serving society. At the same time, they felt that in order for charitable undertakings to be organized and planned, in addition to the high moral character of the managers, the organization itself must have a solid foundation in order to be maintained forever and not be interrupted midway. Therefore, they purchased the land on today's Yunnan Road to establish a permanent foundation. At the same time, they further expanded the scope of charitable undertakings, and the name was changed from "Zhonghe Hall" to "Renji Hall." This was still in the ninth year of the Guangxu reign. The affairs were managed by gentlemen such as Mr. Shi Shanchang, and the support of Governor Mai Yutao was also worth commemorating, setting a good example of the government and the people working together to carry out charitable undertakings forever.

After the Renji Hall opened in its new location at 35 Yunnan Road, the main charitable undertakings it carried out were: providing medical care, providing medicine, and caring for infants. In winter, it provided clothing, rice, and coffins, and cared for widows and the poor. For decades, it did not stop. At present, except for the provision of rice and coffins, which have been temporarily suspended due to practical impossibilities, other activities are still being carried out to the best of its ability. Moreover, when disasters occur in Shanghai and elsewhere, it also does its best to run around to solicit donations and provide assistance with its funds, showing its spirit of "feeling hungry when others are hungry" and "regarding all people as siblings." However, the central task at the moment is providing medical care and medicine.

In the morning, Renji Charitable Hall is already crowded with people. The main hall, the side hall, the courtyard, and the east wing are surrounded by all kinds of people sitting at tables. At first glance, one might almost suspect that they have gone to the wrong place and mistakenly entered some large teahouse or restaurant. However, there are no dazzling red and green costumes here, no nauseating smell of powder, cigarettes, and alcohol, and no soulless songs, laughter, or ramblings. It turns out that they are all poorly clad and sick people. The halls are crowded with people waiting for diagnosis and those receiving medicine. The north and south sides are the diagnosis rooms for internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, ophthalmology, acupuncture, and other departments. The four wings are the medicine dispensing sections.

Providing Medical Care and Medicine

Each doctor is surrounded by several tables of patients waiting for diagnosis. They carefully ask about their conditions and diagnose their illnesses. They even more carefully write diagnoses and prescriptions. Treating one patient often takes a lot of time, unlike the carelessness of general "famous doctors." Moreover, they are especially gentle in repeatedly guiding poor patients with limited knowledge, like a loving mother teaching her beloved daughter, without fearing tediousness, ensuring that the patient fully understands. A patient told the reporter: "Even if you pay a lot of money, you can't find a doctor as good as the ones in Renji Hall!"

The medicine dispensing section is just like an ordinary Chinese medicine store. Director Fang Pinzhang said that their goals are: first, to strive to purchase authentic medicinal materials; second, to be cautious in compounding and preparing medicines; and third, to ensure that the procedures for dispensing medicines according to the prescription are clear, avoiding omissions and errors. He led me to see the situation of poor patients receiving medicine. The staff members were working in an orderly manner, and their nimble hands and feet ensured that the medicine recipients did not have to wait for a long time. The staff members had a conscientious attitude towards their duties, but did not have an arrogant attitude!

He brought out a large stack of records of medical care and medicine dispensing. Taking the eight months of this year as an example, the minimum number of medical consultations was 2,034 in February, and the maximum was 8,192 in August. The minimum number of medicines dispensed was 499 in February, and the maximum was 6,891 doses in August. On average, the total number of medical consultations per month is around 5,000, and the number of medicines dispensed is around 4,500 doses. The total value of medicines dispensed from January to the end of August this year reached a huge sum of 115,000 yuan. The reason for the smaller numbers in January and February, in addition to seasonal factors, was that the hall was experiencing severe financial difficulties at the time and only provided assistance to the extremely poor, while those with some ability were advised to take care of themselves, so fewer medicines were dispensed. It is said that the numbers were extremely large in previous years, with the total number of medical consultations and medicines dispensed exceeding 120,000. Due to the inconvenience of transportation in recent years, most of those seeking medical care and medicine are local residents. However, the numbers are already considerable.

The Shanghai Renji Charitable Hall is now a purely non-governmental charitable organization. The upper-level organization is the board of directors and the board of supervisors, whose members are the most famous gentlemen in the city. The chairman of the board is Mr. Kai Yuting, the vice-chairmen are Mr. Huang Hanzhi and Mr. Zhao Ziqing, the managing directors are Mr. Zhu Yinjiang, Mr. Zhu Zichen, Mr. Lu Jiesun, and Mr. Wang Shuxian, and the directors also include Mr. Shi Shengzhi and eleven others. The standing supervisor is Mr. Zhu Zikui, and the supervisors are Mr. Zhu Zichen, Mr. Zhu Qichen, and Mr. Feng Bingliang.

Benevolent Heart and Benevolent Skills

The actual organization that handles the daily work of Renji Charitable Hall is relatively simple. In addition to the infant care section, which has a separate organization called "Renji Infant Care Hall," it is divided into three main parts: administrative affairs, medical care, and medicine dispensing. The administrative affairs department, including the accountant, has only three staff members. The director is Mr. Xu Rusheng, an honest and capable typical figure, who can promote large-scale undertakings with a small number of personnel. The medicine dispensing department has ten staff members working under the direction of Mr. Fang Pinzhang, who has been serving for more than twenty years. Every morning is the busiest time, and everyone hopes to have two extra pairs of hands to help, so as to avoid the anxiety of the poor and sick. And in the afternoon, they have to prepare medicines, so they are not idle either.

The medical care department is now divided into internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, ophthalmology, acupuncture, and other departments. Each department has a dedicated Chinese medicine doctor in charge. The internal medicine doctors include Qian Xiaopei, Xie Hongying, Zhang Ziqiu, Xie Daitao, Qian Shifang, Fang Boshi, Dong Changsong, Wu Mengying, and Lu Youxiang. Mr. Qian, Mr. Zhang, and Mr. Xie have been serving in the hall for more than ten years. The surgeons include Wang Yukang, Li Shengdong, and Wang Baoqing. The acupuncturists include Kuang Tingfang and Jiang Dianjing. The ophthalmologists include Yu Wanbang and Zhang Yingcai. The pediatricians include Zhu Peiyu and Sister Pan Xiudao from the Yangjingbang Orphanage; most of them have been serving in the hospital for more than ten years.

Although not all the staff members of Renji Charitable Hall are religious believers, they all have the spirit of sacrificing themselves to help others. In this era of soaring prices, the highest salary a staff member can receive is no more than 180 yuan, and the workers only receive 40 or 50 yuan, plus a rice subsidy of 360 yuan. This meager amount is hardly enough to feed themselves, let alone support their families. In addition to the military allowance of 180 yuan per month, the doctors do not receive any other expenses. They have a benevolent heart and practice benevolent skills to save people and help the world. (To be continued)

### Oil and Grain Regulation, Production, and Sales, Supplying Raw Materials to Oil Mills, Rationed Oil for Households to be Sold Widely from the 11th

### Reasons for the Delay in Takahashi Rationed Sugar

Regarding the implementation of sugar rationing in this city, residents of the Takahashi area have not been able to obtain their rations, and they have repeatedly requested solutions to meet their needs. According to reporter inquiries, the reason for the delay in distributing sugar in that area is that the rationing organization has not been fully established, and lacks someone in charge. Relevant authorities are currently urging progress, and as soon as the rationing organization is established, distribution will be carried out according to households.

### Strengthening Air Defense

Central News Agency report: The Nanshi District Baojia Office, considering that the civil air defense facilities in the district are not yet perfect, was ordered to strengthen these facilities.

### Collected Essays of Toyusuke Yoshida, First Volume Published

Mr. Toyusuke Yoshida is a typical Japanese scholar who has lived in China for many years. Regarding Chinese issues, he is able to restrain subjective prejudices and emotions, and is even more willing to humbly listen to opinions that contradict his own, especially the opinions of ordinary Chinese people and young people. Therefore, his insight into the current situation and his understanding of the inner workings of the Chinese nation are by no means accidental. Recently, at the request of this newspaper, he wrote articles expressing his thoughts and opinions. The content focuses on the current situation and politics, but also discusses cultural, economic, and social issues, which have been widely welcomed by readers. Recently, the Sino-Japanese Cultural Research Institute, with the aim of promoting Sino-Japanese cultural exchange, requested to compile the first volume of his collected essays, which has already been published. This newspaper is acting as the distributor, and each copy sells for ten yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes.

We are grateful to the National Government and the Japanese Embassy authorities and colleagues in the press for providing various conveniences and assistance in both Beijing and Shanghai. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude for the grand banquet hosted by the Press Federation today."

### Su Chengde Resigns from Concurrent Position at the Baojia Office, Mayor Chen Approves

According to sources from the Municipal Police Bureau, Mr. Su Chengde, Deputy Director of the First and Third Bureaus, has recently requested Mayor Chen for permission to resign from his concurrent position as Director of the Baojia Office because the police work in the two bureaus is too busy and he has no time to take care of the affairs of the Municipal Baojia Office, so that he can concentrate on planning police affairs. It is said that the mayor has approved.

### Letter

To the Editor: Having recently read the "On Concurrent Positions" editorial in the October 6th Guanbao, we were very grateful for the insightful comments regarding the concurrent positions held by staff of our association in the Rice Control Association. The Rice Control Association was provisionally established at the beginning of last month. Under the direction of Director Yuan, staff were selected and assigned to concurrently handle the affairs of the Rice Control Association in order to achieve the effect of immediate action. When the Rice Control Association was established, all concurrently held positions in the Chamber of Commerce were terminated. Vacancies are currently being filled in order to achieve comprehensive planning and gradual adjustments. We are sending this letter to seek clarification and to have it published in the "Letters" column to correct any misunderstandings. Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce. October 6th.

Yesterday's Newspaper Release Time: 7:40 PM

Brief Commentary: No Concurrent Positions for Rice Control Association Staff

Yesterday's editorial in this newspaper, "On Concurrent Positions," concerned rumors of municipal chamber of commerce staff concurrently holding positions in the newly established Rice and Grain Control Committee. We are dedicated to ensuring the efficiency of both the Rice and Grain Control Committee and the municipal chamber of commerce, urging that individuals resign from one position in order to focus on the other. We are respectfully offering this earnest advice to the authorities of the committee. We have received a letter from the municipal chamber of commerce indicating that staff from the chamber of commerce were temporarily assigned to the Rice Control Association during its preparation, and that upon the association's establishment, these concurrent positions were converted to full-time roles.

From the beginning, we have shown sincere enthusiasm and deep expectation for the Rice and Grain Control Committee. The greater the expectation, the more sincere the sentiment, because rice and grain are so closely and significantly related to the people! In particular, the establishment of the Rice and Grain Control Committee is a response to the urgent demands arising from repeated failures in grain administration in the past. The strict measures and the work of the Rice Control Committee can only succeed and must not fail. Therefore, we must reiterate that establishing a model from the beginning in personnel matters is the basis for the success of the work.

Now, the statement from the municipal chamber of commerce proves that the Rice Control Association authorities have been able to value the arduousness of their tasks, and we are deeply impressed. At the same time, we hope that the association can remain unremitting and accomplish its arduous tasks as soon as possible.

Sports

### Basketball Match: Qianghua Wins

The second act of the grand basketball match was held yesterday afternoon starting at 3:30 PM at the Paramount Ballroom. Because of the intensity of the initial competitions, the crowd was unprecedented. As a result, the women's team celebrated a resounding victory, avenging their defeat in the previous competition. In the battle between the volunteer team of Huanan and Tongren, Huanan relied on good communication to defeat the "specialist" team of Tongren. In the final act, Qianghua fought against a mixed team. Qianghua went into yesterday's match with a do-or-die mentality. The soldiers of the three armies fought with all their might. Yesterday's performance was full of strategy and tension. The battle situation also became a stalemate at times. However, Qianghua had aspirations for success. Under extremely stressful circumstances, they relied on their final efforts and eventually defeated the mixed team with a score of 42 to 32.

Comments from the Economic Sector

### "Usury"

Those of us who study the history of economic thought can all talk about the medieval doctrine of usury. In medieval times, the word "usury" often referred to interest, but its broad meaning included any price that was higher than its fair price, or in other words, taking more than what was given. In the Middle Ages, charging interest was considered absolutely illegal. After the rise of cities and a money economy, this idea changed greatly. With the progress of modern industry and the rise of trade, the value of money and the theory of taking profits were further changed. During wartime, these changes became even greater.

In ancient village autonomous systems, people valued fairness, and taking profits was not allowed. In a monetary economy, the act of lending money and profiting from it was often carried out between individuals or groups with no connection. Thus, the practice of "usury" arose. During wartime, because people generally held the idea of "fishing in troubled waters," they could not engage in purely ethical business behavior. They only knew how to value interest, and interest became heavier and heavier. The way to correct this is to use the power of education to shift human thinking, so that they recognize that the decline of social welfare is the decline of individual welfare.

Therefore, under the call to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood, we advocate restricting merchants' profits. This newspaper's editorial on the issue of loan firms participating in profit distribution believes that "in order to help eliminate hoarding, suppress prices, and fundamentally solve the problem of coping with huge expenditures, it is more appropriate to not participate in profit distribution and endure temporary difficulties." This is the same idea. We have observed that various sectors in Nanshi are requesting to ban pawnshops from increasing interest rates and shortening the pawn period, especially in cases where the pawned item is lost if the pawner accidentally overlooks the expiration date and is not allowed to redeem it. This not only violates legal principles (because after the law establishes a mortgage, the mortgagor can still occupy the mortgaged object and use, benefit from, and dispose of it), but also affects the people's livelihood, because in times of wartime hardship, even middle-class families sometimes have to rely on pawns to maintain their lives. Therefore, "usury" has a significant impact on the welfare of citizens during wartime, so we elaborate on it.

### Ministry of Finance Approved the Commerce Control Association's Permission for Free Trading of Bid Bonds, Prices Also Not Restricted

Central News Agency report: The Executive Yuan's Provisional Regulations on the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth and the Implementation Guidelines stipulate that half of the payment should be converted according to the fixed price of 40,000 yuan per tael (ten liang) of bid bonds. The National Commercial Control Association inquired with the Ministry of Finance, concerned that there had been discussions about nationalizing the bid bonds, and asked whether the bid bonds paid in the future could be freely traded and whether there would be price restrictions. According to a reporter's inquiry with the Commercial Control Association, the Ministry of Finance has formally replied to the association, stating that the nationalization of gold has not been implemented, and cotton merchants who receive bid bonds can freely trade them. There is no restriction on prices, and this can be publicly announced.

### Oil Professional Committee to Establish Offices in Various Production Areas

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency): The Oil and Grain Professional Committee of the Commercial Control Association, considering that various miscellaneous grains such as soybeans, small beans, corn, sorghum, oils, fertilizers, rapeseed, cottonseed, peanuts, and sesame will all be appearing on the market in succession, has made preparations for purchase, distribution, transportation, and sales. Offices will be established in various production areas to facilitate the purchase and transportation work, in order to achieve smooth promotion. It is learned that the office in this capital will be established in the near future.

### Coal Industry Consortium Prohibits Buying and Selling in the Market

The fuel market has been quite chaotic recently, and coal merchants are hoping to obtain illegal profits. "Black market trading" is on the rise again. Yesterday, it was learned that the Coal Industry Consortium, considering that the market currently only allows business firms in the same industry to make transportation contacts and that any transactions are still prohibited, has issued notices separately, absolutely prohibiting buying and selling in the market. Once detected, they will be expelled from the market or severely punished. At the same time, they earnestly advise colleagues to abide by market regulations and not engage in any improper actions. Otherwise, regardless of whether they are known or unknown, they will not be lenient and will be dealt with according to regulations.

Rationed Coal Is Strictly Prohibited from Resale

It has been investigated that the authorities have long authorized the Coal Federation to be responsible for distributing various types of coal (whether it is anthracite, white coal, fines, or lumps) in this city. However, in order to promote welfare, the "Da Zhong Lian Coal Company" was established, and the lower-level institutions are the United Association of Coal Industry Merchants and the United Association of Coal Retail Merchants. The Da Zhong Lian Coal Company has been in charge of distributing coal rations multiple times. However, these coal rations are only limited to being sold to legitimate users, and colleagues are strictly prohibited from reselling each other for profit, or arbitrarily raising prices, or illegally hiding them. Otherwise, the allocation will be canceled.

Raw Materials for Coal Briquettes Are Currently Still Abundant

A Shanghai News reporter learned yesterday from someone familiar with the coal industry that the city's coal reserves are not much different from two or three months ago. It is mistakenly thought that various textile and dyeing factories are in a state of shutdown. The coal supply will be distributed to legitimate users this month, but the raw materials for coal briquettes (white coal fines) are still abundant. The materials needed by various coal briquette factories are supplied by the relevant authorities on a regular basis. However, the supply of coal briquettes has not only failed to improve recently, but has become difficult to purchase. Everyone feels deeply uneasy and hopes that the authorities will clarify the truth in order to benefit the people's livelihood.

### Authorities to Control Egg Prices

Starting this week, China and Japan will implement unified action on the supply and demand of eggs and implement control. Therefore, the high price of eggs can be reduced. The current increase in egg prices is due to merchants disrupting the control.

Reimplementing Distribution Methods

The current plan to control egg prices is to reimplement the previous Sino-Japanese distribution method and determine a price limit. This price limit is approximately equal to the market price on May 1st. The control plan includes both buyers and sellers, so that the supply and demand of eggs in the Shanghai area can be effectively controlled.

Transportation Requires Permission

In order to investigate and deal with the smuggling of eggs, the controlling authorities will issue egg transportation permits starting next week. Those who do not have this permit will not be allowed to pass. At the same time, in order to prevent black market sales, an appropriate system will be established to manage the sale, purchase, and import of eggs in the Shanghai area.

Sino-Japanese Allocation Method

It has been investigated that the Shanghai Japanese Egg Merchants Association and the Shanghai Egg Merchants Association will implement the following distribution plan for the inventory sold by the Yangzhou Egg Cold Storage Company: In terms of eggs, the Japanese Merchants Association will account for 60% and the Chinese merchants will account for 40%. In terms of duck eggs, the Japanese merchants will account for 40% and the Chinese merchants will account for 60%.

Dynamics of Various Trade Associations

Leather Manufacturing Industry: The Leather Manufacturing Industry Association in this city has detailed statistics on the import and export of leather by colleagues every month, so it has been quite effective in suppressing sales prices. Recently, it has also revised business rules, distributed them to colleagues, and they have been approved by all members, awaiting approval from the competent authorities for implementation.

Chinese Medicine Industry: The Chinese Medicine Industry Association in this city has recently undergone a thorough reorganization to adapt to the new economic system in order to promote business. It has now received Order No. 68 from the Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau, designating Sang Yutang and Dong Boqin as members of the preparatory committee, with Sang Yutang as the director of the preparatory committee. Registration procedures for membership applications will be handled at the association's address at 147 Edward Road, Zhonghui Building, Room 104, from today to the 10th.

### Cotton Professional Department to Form Cotton Inspection Committee

After the General Commercial Control Association canceled the Cotton Industry Professional Committee and established a Cotton Industry Professional Department to take charge of the control, purchase, and distribution of cotton, the lower-level organizational structure of the department has also been determined. One is the Cotton Industry United Association of Chinese Merchants, and the other is the China-Japan Cotton Industry Association of Japanese Merchants. The task of inspecting the quality of cotton during future cotton collection will be handled by a Cotton Inspection Committee formed by the mutual dispatch of members from China and Japan, six from each side, for a total of twelve people.

### Brief News

The Overseas Chinese Chemical Company is a joint venture organized by the Nanyang Enterprise Company and overseas Chinese in Shanghai. It has two factories, one for chemical raw materials and one for dry distillation of wood. The chemical raw materials factory has already started production, supplying raw materials to its wood dry distillation factory, which will soon begin manufacturing industrial products such as charcoal and by-products such as wood vinegar and creosote. The company's address is 25 Zhubao San Road, telephone number 85867.

### Chinese Stock Market Treasure Book to Be Republished, Purchased Eagerly Yesterday

The "Pocket Chinese Stock Market Treasure Book," the most complete reference book for Chinese stock investors, was published yesterday. It is distributed by the Enterprise Publication Agency at 996 Jing'an Temple Road (Meiqi Building). Customers flocked to purchase it. It is estimated that over 1,000 copies were sold in one day. It is reported that there are not many copies printed, so purchase quickly. In response to the enthusiastic demand from all parties, the agency has decided to prepare for the republication as soon as the first edition is sold out.

Business Summary

Public Bonds: The market for unified public bonds was depressed due to the continued selling of physical bonds. Category C bonds fell sharply, while Categories A, B, and E fell less sharply. Category D bonds traded at the key point. All bonds traded slightly lower than before.

Rice and Grains: Arrivals of rice were plentiful. Retail sales were initially active but then became stagnant. Individual households continued to purchase. Sentiment remained firm. Price fluctuations were limited. Edible oil remained in high demand and short supply. Prices continued to fall gradually.

Northern Goods: Arrivals remained sparse. Sales in this street and inland were sluggish. Gold needles and ears continued to rise. Red and black dates were quietly rising. Almonds remained steady.

Medicinal Materials: There were more sellers. This is largely due to the fact that the industry association has been reorganized and the business has been reformed. Some domestic buyers were deeply afraid of being restricted, and many sold their goods.

Industrial Raw Materials: Trading has been especially slow recently. Because of the implementation of control over yarn and cloth, some factories have stopped production, so the market has become greatly depressed. Currently, except for white wax, which has seen slight activity due to unscheduled retail sales, items such as pigments are still lacking in activity.

Daily Necessities: The market situation is stagnant. Sentiment in all directions is sluggish. Soap and matches are not inquired about. Kerosene candles are still selling well, but because there is a shortage of goods, prices remain steady. The prices of American, British, and new high-end cigarettes are increasing. Miscellaneous brands are also increasing in unison.

Commercial Control Association Control Work

Welcome Instructions and Criticism

Letters Must Include True Name and Address

According to the person in charge of the National Commercial Control Association, this association is a commercial autonomous group with the important responsibility of control. In this initial stage of implementation, there are many complex and confusing issues. We look forward to the wise men of society working together to make progress. All matters that this association should promote and reform are extremely welcome to external instructions and criticisms, so as to learn and reform. Since the establishment of this association, there has been no shortage of wise men who have given us advice. We are deeply grateful for their concern. However, recently we have often received reports and letters that do not include a true name or communication address, so there is no way to consult, which is regrettable. We hope that in the future, those who send letters for advice will be sure to include their true name and address so that we can consult. If necessary, we will absolutely keep it confidential.

### General Situation of the Central Reserve Bank's Implementation of Monetary Policy: Notable Success in Commodity Control and Currency Work

The Central Reserve Bank, in order to curb prices and establish sound financial institutions, has been committed to contracting currency and striving to maintain currency prices since March of this year. Recently, the financial community has achieved a sound foundation, and significant results have been achieved in price and currency work. The commodity control measures have yielded results for the financial community that can be expected. Before this spring, the Central Reserve Bank strived to circulate Central Reserve Bank notes and carry out unified currency work, so that the post-war

National Government economy

achieved a major improvement. At the same time, rising prices not only affected the lives of ordinary people, but also affected wartime economic work. Therefore, it focused on controlling commodities and suppressing currency, and actively implemented measures to restrict loans and recover funds, which were the key points of the currency contraction policy. It also encouraged public savings to absorb idle funds. On March 15, the Central Reserve Bank's Loan Consolidation Regulations were announced. Within two months after March 15, the Central Reserve Bank gradually recovered

Interbank Lending

Without special permission, loans will no longer be granted, and no extensions will be granted after the expiration date. General unsecured loans and collateral loans for daily necessities such as grain, cotton, and yarn were also suspended. If goods were requested as collateral, members of the trade association were required to hold a certificate from the association and a business license issued by the competent authority. As a result, after the implementation of strict economic measures, the general public and financial figures were greatly panicked, and the money market showed an abnormal contraction. In late May, the Central Reserve Bank's fund recovery work came to an end.

Controlled Finance

After the state gradually returned to normal, loans from the Bank of Japan were generally subject to the embassy's oversight, while the Bank of China implemented control autonomously through the Banking Association, in order to assist the Central Reserve Bank's financial control work and promote its smooth implementation. Subsequently, with the cooperation of both the government and the people, currency work became even smoother. The Central Reserve Bank previously issued notes, which were greatly affected by the Japanese abolition of the issuance of military notes. Society's demand for funds was extremely strong, and after reaching an unprecedented high last month, it gradually stagnated. Before long, due to

Issuance of Lottery Tickets

The capital absorption work was further strengthened, and the deposit amounts of the Central Reserve Bank and other banks showed an increasing trend. The financial community returned to a healthy track of development. As a result, the Shanghai price index showed a downward trend. The black market rice price gradually fell from late July, and other general commodities also gradually softened following the rice price. Taking Shanghai as an example, it can be seen that commodity control and currency work have achieved considerable results.

Future Issues

The issue now is how to promote the current currency work rationally, especially how the Cotton and Cotton Yarn Collection of the Commercial Control Association will be used, and whether the Rice and Grain Control Committee's purchase of rice can solve the problem of suppressing prices. We place great hope on this.

Opinions on the Food Problem

### Preliminary Suggestions for Improving the Food Problem

— Shi Yu

The food problem is the most important issue in the national economy and people's livelihood. Our country has always attached great importance to it since ancient times. In the Great Plan, the first of the eight administrations is food. Confucius also said that in governing, "sufficiency of food" is necessary. The Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, in the Three Principles of the People, also considered "the food problem" to be one of the four major needs of life. Since the outbreak of the China Incident, the food problem has become serious, and the government has even set up a special department to solve the people's food problem. Taking the situation in Shanghai as an example, the implementation of food control has been going on for more than a year. However, the ration of household rice is getting less and less, and the black market price of rice is getting more and more expensive, making the general public feel the pain of not being able to make ends meet. Indeed, the difficulty in managing food administration is a fact. This situation cannot be solely blamed on the food administration organs. However, I'm afraid no one will deny that the food administration has not been handled satisfactorily. There have been precedents in history for malpractices in handling food, and it did not start today. Moreover, no matter how the malpractices change, they are ultimately due to two kinds of reasons: internal reasons and external reasons.

Internal Reasons

The so-called "internal reasons" are the malfeasance of the personnel in charge. Although there are thousands of details, they can be summarized into several types: "reporting cheap as expensive," "reporting expensive as cheap," "reporting more as less," and "reporting less as more." The so-called "reporting cheap as expensive" means that when buying food, using inferior goods and reporting them at a higher price. Although the quantity does not decrease, the difference in price due to the difference in quality is still considerable. As for storage time and transportation time, the practice of "reporting more as less" and "reporting less as more" should be implemented. The so-called "reporting more as less" means that when storing or starting transportation, it is clearly received one million piculs of high-quality rice, but it may be reported as 950,000 piculs received, citing losses. Then, the excess amount is the benefit of the handler. As for the time of release from the warehouse, the superior may designate 800,000 piculs of rice to be dispatched, but only 780,000 piculs may be shipped, and inferior goods may be used. Thus, the two techniques of "reporting cheap as expensive" and "reporting less as more" can be used in combination. As for "reporting expensive as cheap," it can be applied during storage or distribution. For example, it is clearly received high-quality rice, but it may be reported as secondary rice, using the secondary rice to make up for it and selling the high-quality rice. The difference between one in and one out can be called profit. In addition, there are various items such as those mentioned in the Shanghai News Agency's editorial on September 3, and the return of sacks, etc. Therefore, those who handle food and official duties in our country are naturally considered to have poor salaries. Although there are regulations on losses, they are mostly lenient, and there are still many places where people can manipulate things. Those who are not ruthless have considerable income. If they are more ruthless, they can become wealthy in a short time!

External Reasons

In addition to the "internal reasons" mentioned above, there are also "external reasons" why our country's food administration cannot be handled well. "External reasons" can be further divided into "overlapping taxes," "slow transportation," "bandit disturbances," and "imperfect investigation." The so-called "overlapping taxes" is written very thoroughly and clearly in Mr. Zhang Yunbo's "Fair Price of Rice" in the Shanghai News on September 5, so there is no need for the author to talk more. The so-called "slow transportation"... when ships are insufficient, there is indeed a state of cherishing its ability to help. It seems that we should gradually find ways to improve, so that the people of Shanghai can obtain peace of mind. As for "bandit disturbances," because the government's peaceful areas are expanding day by day, bandit areas still exist. These areas not only do not obey government orders, but also cause disturbances. Farmers' rice is often bought by them at low prices, so that it cannot be transported to cities, causing unexpected panic in the future of people's food. Furthermore, due to "imperfect investigation," the area of arable land in each region, the average annual harvest, and how much surplus is available for application in other regions, except to supply the needs of the local people. Moreover, it seems that the government does not have any specific plans for how to adjust the food supply in various places, but only treats the symptoms rather than the root cause. Therefore, there is a phenomenon that the regulated food supply cannot arrive in Shanghai on time (this is based on reports). If there can be a detailed plan and a strict organization, then the food supply in Shanghai should arrive on schedule, and there should be no delays or reductions!

Regarding the food problem in our country, it is better to strive for future improvements than to talk about the malpractices of the past. On the one hand, increase production so that the people of the whole country can be self-sufficient. On the other hand, eliminate corruption so that farmers and rice-eating people can all benefit and not feel pain. In the current environment, it is of course necessary to implement control. Food control can be further divided into the steps of control and the organs of control to seek countermeasures:

Steps to Control Food

Although our country is known as an agricultural country, there are different opinions among scholars as to whether the annual food production is sufficient to meet the needs of the people. Judging from the current situation, it is difficult for anyone to deny that food production should be increased. In addition, reasonable control should be exercised over purchasing, storage, transportation, distribution, etc., so that the current serious state of food can gradually improve. The following is a separate discussion:

Production Control: Regarding China's current food problem, a policy of promoting production should be adopted, divided into the following eight items:

(A) Increase the Yield per Unit Area: If the yield of crops per unit area is to be increased, it is first necessary to examine the productivity of the land. If the productivity of the land has reached the edge of intensive cultivation, then even if capital and labor are increased, the result will inevitably be subject to the law of diminishing returns. The productivity of Chinese land, in terms of the unit area of food crops, is known to be not fully utilized. Professor T.L. Buck calculated the average yield per hectare of major crops in 2,866 farms in 7 provinces and 17 regions in China, and compared them with those of other countries. The results are as follows:

Comparison of Average Yields per Hectare of Major Crops in Various Countries (Unit: Quintal)

By examining the above table, it can be seen that there are still many places where the yields of Chinese crops are not as good as those of others. From this, it can be seen that the productivity of Chinese land has not yet been improved. If the rice yield can be increased to the same as Japan's, a yield of 30 quintals per hectare is also equal to 13.5 quintals in Japan. The corn yield per hectare and the area of ​​production in the United States... there are no accurate statistics on the area of ​​wasteland in our country: the area of ​​land reaches more than 1,177.7 million mu, and as for arable wasteland, 1,464 million mu. Furthermore, if wells can be built and ditches can be opened in the Yellow River Basin, and machines can be used in the Yangtze River Basin to build dikes and gates, the area of ​​cultivation will be expanded. If these wastelands are used to sow grains, even if China does not improve production, the annual production of rice and wheat will definitely increase greatly. As for the use of wasteland, the government should set up a special reclamation bureau to be responsible for handling it, which will naturally be very effective.

(C) Improve Rice and Wheat Seeds: Because the seeds of rice and wheat in various parts of our country are mixed, the varieties are inferior, and the harvest is poor. At present, there is considerable recognition in the country of the importance and value of variety improvement. Local government agencies, as well as agricultural schools and agricultural experiment stations, all undertake the work of variety testing, and use scientific methods to improve seeds. According to reports, the rice seeds improved by National Central University can increase production by more than 100% compared with the seeds of farmers that have not been improved. The result of the promotion of the improved rice seed No. 2905 of Jinling University near Nanjing is that it can increase production by 40% compared to the seeds of farmers. According to the results of the wheat improvement experiment of the University, a single-spike variety can increase production by 56.8%, and improved varieties and hybrid breeding can increase production by 98.3% to 105.3%. In addition, the standard yield of rice breeding experiments can be increased by 42% to 77%. It can be said that the seeds of rice and wheat in our country should be improved, which is undoubtedly a well-known fact.

(D) Improve Irrigation and Drainage: In North China, rainfall is scarce during the growing season of crops, especially during the growing season of wheat and other winter crops, and the area irrigated by rivers is also limited, so the yield per mu of crops is very low, and planting is also restricted. Therefore, the construction of irrigation projects and the increase of irrigation water sources are really essential, but the projects are huge and must be handled by the government. Previously, the North China International Famine Relief Commission had advocated well irrigation in various parts of North China. It is said that although the irrigated area is small, the results are very good, and it is easy for farmers to do it, and it can be promoted. As for the Yangtze River Basin, most of the land is low-lying, and the polder fields and lake beaches are idle in winter. Even if crops are planted, the yield is not abundant. The reason is that the land is low and wet, and wheat cannot grow fully. Furthermore, every summer, mountain floods near the Yangtze River often occur, which can easily cause floods, so drainage work is extremely important. Dr. Wiskov once conducted a drainage production experiment in the low-lying fields of Zhejiang. The result was that the yield of drained low-lying fields increased by 30% compared to those that were not drained, so it is also important to promote drainage work.

(E) Prevent and Control Pests and Diseases: Although there are no accurate statistics on the losses caused by pests and diseases to rice and wheat crops in our country, the damage caused by stem borers is common in all regions, which can be called severe. According to the estimates of entomologists in the past, the damage caused by stem borers to the rice grain of the Republic of China averaged 120,000 jin per year. If estimated according to current prices, it is of course even more considerable. In addition, there are rice blast, rice sesame spot, wheat smut, wheat black smut, wheat black... the annual losses are also extremely considerable. There are many ways to prevent and control rice... Methods of manual prevention and control, such as collecting eggs in the fields in spring, destroying roots and stems in winter, or flooding the fields with water. Methods of chemical prevention and control, such as using carbon disulfide, chromic acid, sulfur, etc. to kill pests; using carbonic acid, formalin, copper sulfate, and chromic acid, etc. to control diseases. Scientific prevention and control methods, such as using these or allocating... to create disease-resistant varieties to replace diseased varieties. Recently, European and American countries have adopted the above-mentioned methods to prevent and control the damage of crops, and the promotion has been quite effective. Domestic agricultural universities and agricultural experiment stations are also imitating them, and they should be promoted as soon as possible. If the losses are reduced, it is to increase the production of crops.

(F) Improve Fertilization: The fertility of the soil is most closely related to the yield per mu, so maintaining and improving the fertility of the soil is extremely important for improving crop production. Farmers in our country only know how to stick to old methods and never pay attention to fertilization, so they simply do not understand the issue of improving soil fertility. According to the results of European and American experiments, the application of appropriate fertilizers can increase wheat production by 20% to 50%. According to the results of the Nanjing experiment, if appropriate fertilizers are applied, wheat production can be increased by 15%. In addition, European and American countries use chemical fertilizers to increase production by 15% to 50%, so the quality and quantity of fertilizers should be improved in our country. Fertilization should be sufficient in quantity so that the soil fertility can be properly maintained; and the combination of the three fertilizer elements should be appropriate so that the soil fertility can be improved. In the future, the soil of the whole country should be analyzed as soon as possible, and a national fertilizer experiment should be held, so that the most suitable area for chemical fertilizers can be determined, and natural fertilizers should be improved, and domestic ammonium sulfate and other artificial fertilizers should be developed to resist the invasion of imported products. In addition, the combination of the three fertilizer elements, as well as the improvement of fertilization time and methods, etc., should also be studied in detail before they can be promoted...

### Responding to the Movement to Ban Smoking and Gambling

— Jing Wan

Yesterday, I saw Mr. Gardener's masterpiece in the News, and I was quite moved. Smoking and gambling tools were all burned, which was also refreshing. I absolutely agree and hope that the Citizens' Thrift Association will promote it.

Smoking a few cigarettes and playing eight rounds of mahjong are very common and ordinary things. Most readers think it is very serious. Thinking about it carefully, people really take it too casually and too unimportant! Many people who eat white noodles and sleep in alleys have gradually become like this.

In the social circle, about 99 out of 100 people smoke, and the other one is bound to smoke. Mahjong need not be mentioned. Three-foot children have already woven red middle whiteboards. The harm of being exposed to it is more than this.

Wake up, addicts of smoking and gambling! Do not hesitate, put the smoking and gambling tools at home before the Thrift Association determines specific methods, and first personally ban smoking, not only restrain yourself, but also persuade friends. At least when guests come to the door, offer a cup of tea instead of cigarettes. This is easy to do, so why not do it?

I have always advocated the cloth clothing movement for decades as one day. I hate smoking and gambling even more, but I cannot prohibit the actions of others. The directors of the Thrift Association unanimously suggested that saving time, energy, and economy should first promote the ban on smoking and gambling. Now, burn them by hand to show determination, and I hope those who are interested will also do so.

Samsung Soap Factory's Loan-Sale Method

In order to maintain the livelihood of the common people and support small businesses, Samsung Soap Factory has specifically formulated a loan-sale method so that those without capital can use their lives. The method is as follows: All those who are introduced through Shen Bao and have a shop guarantee of 500 yuan can apply to the factory for goods to be sold on credit. After the factory accepts the guarantee and confirms it, it will lend various soaps worth 500 yuan at the lowest price, to be sold in stalls or by hand, but the proceeds from the sale must be returned to the factory in full every night, and then the sold-out goods will be replenished for sale the next day. If the lender cannot clear the account and pay the money every night, the qualification for lending will be revoked, and the guarantor will be pursued for compensation. If it is impossible to find a guarantor, it is also possible to deposit a considerable amount of credit or cash as a guarantee. As long as the loan is settled, the guarantee can be returned at any time. This method can be consulted at Samsung Soap Factory, No. 17 Xinxin Market, Jing'an Temple Road, corner of Erming Road.

Donation of Malaria Pills

Defeng Charity Association has been donating malaria pills for many years, which are very effective. Whether it is new or old malaria, one dose can cure it completely. Yesterday, 50 doses were donated to this place. If philanthropists from all over the world have the heart to donate, the association can match them at cost. The association is located at No. 1 Yuanshang Lane, Dongzilaihuo Street, 8th District.
