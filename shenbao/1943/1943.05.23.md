### Discussing Disaster Relief in North China and the Prerequisites for Organizing Relief Efforts

— Zhang Yipeng

The disaster in the four provinces of North China this time is severe, and relief is urgently needed. The deep concern of the National Government and the fervent support of the Shanghai people have deeply moved us. Although we are currently facing anxieties due to rising prices and severe food shortages, comparatively, we are still in paradise compared to the disaster victims of North China. If we only care about ourselves and remain indifferent, not to mention superstitious notions of karma, even according to Mencius's principle of "continuing to wear the hat while disheveled," we cannot remain unmoved. Therefore, the results of this soft approach will be remarkable. However, once funds are available, relief efforts must be organized, which is not an easy task. In the past, Shanghai had famous relief organizers, first Shi (Ziying) and Sheng (Xingsun), then Feng (Menghua) and Zhu (Ziqiao). The processes of Shi and Zhu's relief efforts are scattered in notes and difficult to gather at once. Sheng and Feng have many published manuscripts. I want to collect some materials to provide references for this relief effort.

There are three major types of relief: spring relief, winter relief, and emergency relief. Spring relief focuses on distributing seeds; winter relief focuses on distributing clothing and porridge; emergency relief requires purchasing and transporting food to disaster areas on a strict schedule, so it is essential to have someone willing to advance funds. Fundraising often proceeds unevenly, and any delay will leave farmers waiting to die, inevitably leading to fruitless efforts. Moreover, if no one plants the following year, disaster will inevitably continue. The most famous emergency relief organizer was Sheng, who used methods of advance borrowing. The telegraph bureau, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Commercial Bank of China under his management were all his external treasuries. Even the Daqing Bank of the Ministry of Finance and the Railway Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Communications often reported to the government and allocated funds separately (Yuzhai Collected Manuscripts, first edition). Of course, Sheng's position and influence at the time allowed him to say and do things, but the mental effort of planning and coordinating was considerable! However, this method of emergency relief fundraising also has shortcomings: the amount is too large, and those who advance the money are uneasy; the amount is too small, and the relief efforts are not widespread. This is one. Banks require interest, effectively discounting the funds. This is two. If the donation is too small for debt repayment, no one will be willing to take on the responsibility. This is three. To avoid various troubles, the best approach is to issue public bonds. The total amount of the bonds can be slightly larger, and they can be issued in installments. Assuming a bond amount of 100 million yuan, it can be divided into four installments: 40 million in the first installment, and 20 million in the second, third, and fourth installments, with adjustments made according to the needs of the "degree" of the relief effort. Some people say that printing and numbering public bond certificates takes too much time and is too slow to meet the urgent need. However, issuing public bonds with receipts first, which can be exchanged for certificates within a certain period, has been done before. Furthermore, underwriting should be entrusted to banks and money houses, which can issue receipts separately, making it even easier. Some people also say that public bonds require guarantees, which will increase the government's expenses. However, since the people are the foundation of the nation, if we cannot prevent disasters in advance and cannot fully provide relief, the responsibility for providing guarantees seems difficult to shirk. Moreover, the guarantee funds can be designated from a specific tax source or by creating a new surtax. As long as it is fair and selfless, it will not harm the political system. Holders of public bonds can circulate them on the market like other securities and can also help prevent inflation, achieving multiple benefits in one stroke. Perhaps this is a worthwhile strategy.

The most difficult part of organizing relief is investigation and distribution, where investigation means surveying households, and distribution means providing relief according to the household. If the investigation and distribution are not done properly, not only will there be no effect, but it will even be impossible to clean up the mess. Those involved in investigation and distribution can be divided into two main categories: primary and secondary. Primary personnel must be honest and impartial. Honesty means not only not taking money or engaging in corruption but also ensuring that one does not spend more than others, even if it is just a small amount. Mr. Feng Linyi (Guifen) of my hometown personally wrote a couplet and hung it in various charity halls: "Squandering public funds will be punished by Heaven and reduced by Earth;" "Embezzling charitable donations will lead to sons becoming thieves and daughters becoming prostitutes." He once said that embezzling charitable donations would not be done by those who cherish their reputation in the village, but squandering public funds is something everyone is prone to do. For example, using official stationery and envelopes to write personal letters is also a form of squandering. This is how strict it is. Impartiality is an especially important condition. When Shi Ziying was investigating relief in Baodi County, many orphans and widows clamored for relief, demanding more. Shi found that several families were hiding grain and rice and were not truly impoverished. However, they continued to make noise. Shi then publicly said, "If all orphans and widows must receive relief, then should the current Emperor and Empress Dowager also receive relief?" (Incident from the early years of the Guangxu reign). Therefore, I hope that the leaders of the relief efforts will be honest and impartial. As for the secondary personnel, they must be able to endure hardship and be obedient. Although they occupy a secondary position in the overall process, the completion of the relief effort depends entirely on their efforts. They must travel day and night, endure hunger and thirst, walk through slums, and carry supplies from house to house. If they cannot endure hardship, how can they accomplish this? It is said that Zhu Ziqiao personally distributed relief in Shaanxi but had his load of steamed buns completely looted by starving people on the road. His clothes were torn, and his fingers were scratched, which was a common occurrence. Furthermore, the distribution of rations must follow the commander's instructions, otherwise, it will significantly affect the entire operation.

After all this talk, we are still back to the main topic. The disaster relief in North China is, of course, an emergency relief effort. It would be best if a considerable amount of money could be raised within ten days to half a month. However, the matter of public bonds is also something we should prepare for, even if we don't end up using them. Moreover, we must prepare seeds and employment relief for them, and even prepare for winter relief. There are many places where money is needed! As for investigation and distribution, it should be designed early. In my humble opinion, it seems that a general relief office should be established in the capital, and branch offices should be established in North Hebei, East Shandong, South Shanxi, and North Henan. Each branch office should have one director and one deputy director, chosen from officials and gentry in the respective provinces. It is also necessary to seek out people with experience in previous relief efforts and widely recruit them to investigate and distribute relief separately, in order to achieve early success.

### The Russo-Japanese War: Records from This Newspaper Thirty-Eight Years Ago - Old News Newly Copied (3)

Introduction

We recognize that defending the Pacific from now on will be entirely the responsibility of Asians, and we will no longer allow Anglo-American forces to interfere and invade. However, fulfilling the task of defense depends on a strong naval force. Our friendly nation, Japan, has built up its navy through decades of diligent effort and continuous improvement. In the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, they showed their strength by defeating the outnumbered. In the Great East Asia War, they further demonstrated their invincible power. Currently, the entire defense of the Pacific is solely shouldered by the navy of our friendly nation, and we are deeply ashamed that we have not been able to share the burden. Therefore, how we will emulate the navy of our friendly nation to build a new Chinese navy and participate in the task of defending the Pacific is a goal that all Chinese people should strive to achieve urgently. To increase the Chinese people's naval knowledge and interest, this newspaper will extract and re-copy the records of this newspaper during the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, from the 21st to the 30th, for a period of ten days. We hope readers will pay attention.

### Examples of Why China Cannot Firmly Adhere to Neutrality (Published in This Newspaper, No. 11082, Guangxu Year 30, Month 1, Day 11, Western Calendar February 26, 1904, Friday)

When Country A and Country B have started hostilities, the neighboring country neither helps Country A nor helps Country B. This is called adhering to neutrality. International law experts also call it non-enemy status. In the past, European countries such as Switzerland, Belgium, Serbia, and Luxembourg all followed this example. This is because Switzerland is located in a strategic location, bordering France, Germany, Austria, and Italy. The rivers and streams within its borders all originate from the Swiss mountains, making it difficult to defend the borders. Switzerland's adherence to neutrality is crucial to the overall situation, and if it does not adhere to it, it will be difficult to avoid endangering itself. Belgium is located between France and Germany and has historically been a battlefield for various countries. According to the Treaty of London in 1831, various countries ordered it to maintain neutrality permanently in order to avoid war forever. Serbia's adherence to neutrality began with the Treaty of Paris in 1856. Luxembourg's adherence to neutrality began with the Treaty of London in 1867. In short, there are two reasons for adhering to neutrality: one is that it is voluntarily done based on one's own assessment of the situation; the other is that it is imposed by neighboring countries through treaties due to significant relationships with neighboring countries. However, once the intention to maintain neutrality has been declared, one must strictly adhere to the rules of neutrality in order to comply with international law. Otherwise, it will be difficult to avoid being despised by the enemy and losing one's own rights and interests. Now that Russia and Japan have met with weapons and started hostilities, most European countries are adhering to neutrality, and China has also clearly issued an edict stating that both Russia and Japan are friendly countries and should be dealt with in accordance with the principle of neutrality. When facing countries with comparable strength and during fierce battles, it is only natural to remain neutral if one's own military preparedness is not strong enough. However, adhering to this principle is not easy, and there are two main requirements: one is not to abandon the right to wage war; the other is not to show bias. According to Ding's translation of International Law, Chapter 743, a neutral country does not have to renounce its right to wage war in advance. The explanation is: some countries always adhere to neutrality but still do not abandon their right to wage war. Without the right to wage war, there is no way to defend the law and protect oneself; without the ability to protect oneself, one loses the status of an autonomous country. Chapter 748 states: a neutral country, fearing that the warring country will violate its borders, often sets up troops to defend and block, which is called holding troops to observe. The explanation is: deploying troops for defense and blockage should not be regarded as an act of war, but rather as an intention to preserve one's neutrality. A country that cannot protect itself with arms will inevitably be subject to opportunistic encroachment by warring countries. From these two sections, it can be seen that although a neutral country does not participate in the war, it must not abandon its right to wage war. Before the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, the Chinese government either advocated alliance with Russia or alliance with Japan, and opinions differed, leading to different arguments. After the outbreak of hostilities, although the government declared neutrality and announced it to various countries, its intentions revealed a greater fear of Russia than of Japan. Recently, because Russian warships were anchored in the Shanghai River, the Shanghai Daotai cited international law to force them to leave China's waters within 24 hours. However, the Russian minister, citing the protection of Russian officials and merchants, consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and actually allowed them to anchor in the center of the river. Now that the two countries are at war, warships of either country should not be allowed to enter and anchor in the ports of a neutral country. This is what international law requires. If it is said that officials and merchants fear being caught in the crossfire, then the responsibility for protection lies with China. Why should we immediately allow Russian warships to anchor there? If enemy countries recruit troops within our borders or Chinese people privately provide assistance, all actions related to military intelligence that benefit one country and harm the other, if not detected and acted upon rashly, how can we avoid mutual accusations? Therefore, the policy of neutrality is not easy to implement. If those in charge rely on existing treaties and fail to pay attention to these measures, I fear that disaster is imminent, and the state of neutrality will not last long.

### Japanese Newspaper Describes the Topography of the Lushun Forts (Published in This Newspaper, No. 11110, Guangxu Year 30, Month 2, Day 9, Western Calendar March 25, 1904, Friday)

A certain newspaper in Osaka, Japan, said: In any country, all important passes are prohibited from using photography to map out the terrain, so the location of the forts is unknown to foreigners. However, the Russian military laws are not strict, and the soldiers are lax, so the plans of the Lushun forts were obtained by Japanese soldiers. Among them, several were clearly built by Chinese people, and later renovated by the Russian army, making them look brand new. In total, there are about 30 forts in various places. The one on the Tiger Tail Peninsula is called Wei Yuan. In addition, there are six forts, such as Xinjitou, Gaoshan, Manziying, Mantoushan, and Chengtoushan. The Wei Yuan fort on Tiger Tail faces the sea and extends southwest to Laotieshan, continuously. The Laotieshan fort is located at the tip of Lushun, at the foot of Laotieshan. Huangjinshan Fort is the largest of all the forts, located south of the old city and facing Tiger Tail. There is a protruding corner at the entrance of Lushun, with two forts to the southeast and due west. The forts due west are collectively called Huangjinshan Fort, just as the forts in Laotieshan are collectively called Laotieshan Fort. To the east of Huangjinshan is Muzhu Reef Fort, with two built-up camps. To the northeast of Muzhu Reef is Qizizuijiao Fort. All of the above forts face the sea. In addition, behind Xinjie, there are also forts protecting Yizishan, Songshushan, and Erlongshan, to prevent the enemy from attacking from behind. Yizishan has two forts, Anzishan and Wangtai Fort, to control the east. Songshushan Fort is east of Yizishan, and further east is Erlongshan Fort, and further east are Jiguan, Taboshan, and Pantao Mountain forts. These are all used to prevent the enemy from attacking from the east of Xinjie. To the west of Xinjie are Yangjiatun and Taijiatun, located near Jiuwan, where new forts are also being built, but not completed. In total, there are 26 forts that have been completed or renovated, and there are also many that have been surveyed and are under construction. When the Japanese army attacked Lushun for the fourth time, Wei Yuan and Manziying forts were destroyed by artillery fire. This is because the Tiger Tail Peninsula directly faces the ocean, causing the forts to collapse and the gun emplacements to tilt.

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The valiant sacrifice of Japanese Admiral Yamamoto has deeply saddened all industrial warriors in Japan. They are determined to work harder in their respective positions to continue to serve the country, to comfort the soul of the late Admiral in heaven. At the same time, the belief in certain victory of the 100 million Japanese people is becoming stronger and stronger. Especially the workers directly engaged in the production of munitions are even more grief-stricken, and they believe that the only way to comfort the spirit of the late Admiral is to strive to increase production. The Japan Industrial Patriotic Association, in view of this, plans to hold various events to enhance the fighting spirit of industrial warriors. It has decided that on the day of the late Admiral's state funeral, all workers will donate one day's income to the Ministry of the Navy. The specific measures will be notified to national industrial patriotic organizations soon to enable implementation. According to the president of the Obata Industrial Patriotic Association, Kobata, Admiral Yamamoto bravely fought on the front line in the South and unfortunately died valiantly, which is enough to prove the intensity of this war. At the same time, we should make a new combat resolution to comfort the spirit of the late Admiral. Therefore, we should further enhance the fighting spirit and strive to defeat the Anglo-Americans. The Industrial Patriotic Association plans to appeal to all munitions workers across the country to strive to increase the production of aircraft in order to improve the spirit of war. The specific plan is being studied. At present, the national industrial warriors have a higher sense of hatred and unity.

Buenos Aires, Capital of Argentina, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to a report from New York, former Tokyo correspondent of the Associated Press, Bob, said regarding the death of Japanese Admiral Yamamoto: The Japanese Allied News Agency broadcast that Admiral Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet, had died in battle. With the death of Admiral Yamamoto, the Japanese Navy has lost its most capable leader. Admiral Yamamoto was thoughtful, resolute, and upright. During this war, he resolutely adopted new tactics, so he was indeed an outstanding talent in the Japanese Navy. The plan to attack Pearl Harbor was probably drafted by Admiral Yamamoto. Admiral Yamamoto was the first person in Japan to recognize the need for the army and the navy to cooperate as a whole. Perhaps he was also the first person in the world to recognize this need. He made the army and navy fully exert the effect of cooperation. By attacking Pearl Harbor and the Battle of Malaya, he enabled the Japanese Navy to control the vast region from the Western Pacific to the Indian Ocean. Although we do not know what impact the death of Admiral Yamamoto will have on the Japanese Navy, the organization of the Japanese Navy's leadership is like a machine, which no other country's combat unit can match. Although Admiral Yamamoto was extremely great, he did not have much impact on the entire Japanese Navy.

Brief Commentary

### In Deep Mourning for Admiral Yamamoto

Former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet, Admiral Yamamoto, died valiantly in battle on the front line. The sad news shocked all of Asia. Not only the people of Japan, out of admiration for Admiral Yamamoto's achievements during his lifetime, expressed their heartfelt mourning. Even the Chinese people, because Admiral Yamamoto was defending the Pacific and liberating the freedom of Asians, also expressed their heartfelt mourning because they had lost a leader.

The ancients said: "People are bound to die, and death can be heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather." Today, Admiral Yamamoto sacrificed his life to fulfill his loyalty to the country and defend East Asia, which can be said to be a death heavier than Mount Tai. Soldiers originally have the spirit of "regarding death as returning home," and sacrificing their lives on the battlefield is considered glory. Therefore, for the Admiral himself, he has "completed his achievements and sacrificed his life, and has no regrets looking up or down."

There are indeed many outstanding generals in the Japanese Navy who have created glorious achievements in the past and future naval history. However, we feel even more that the Japanese Navy "has been continuously tempered for decades and has cultivated a united spirit, becoming an entire naval fortress." This is the characteristic of the Japanese Navy. Therefore, although Admiral Yamamoto's death has deprived the Japanese Navy of an outstanding general, it will not diminish the overall naval power. On the contrary, it will be enough to arouse a higher sense of "common hatred of the enemy" among all the officers and soldiers of the Japanese Navy, and accelerate the destruction of the enemy in order to continue Admiral Yamamoto's legacy. We respectfully express our sympathy and mourn the death of Admiral Yamamoto; and we expect the victory of the Japanese Navy with great enthusiasm.

### Ambassador Tani Discusses the Direction of New Policy Towards China

The Japanese Asahi Shimbun published on May 18th the main points of Ambassador Tani's first meeting with Chinese and Japanese journalists in Nanjing on the 17th, which are clearer and more concrete than those previously published by various newspapers. Therefore, we have translated them as follows. —Editor's Note

Ambassador Tani held his first meeting with a group of Chinese and Japanese journalists at the embassy on the 17th and gave a speech, hinting at the specific progress sequence of the new policy towards China in the future as follows:

(1) Remaining issues of the new policy towards China in the future include the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the adjustment of national policy companies, the transfer of new enemy properties, and foreign trade institutions. In terms of sequence, it is planned to start with the abolition of taxation rights in extraterritorial rights first.

(2) Regarding the abolition of taxation rights, the second special committee will be held on the 17th, and a specific decision will be made. Formal negotiations with China will begin next month.

(3) The return of the Shanghai International Settlement will proceed in parallel with the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and preparations will be made under the policy of realizing them one by one after the Chinese side has completed preparations.

(4) The adjustment of national policy companies is the principle policy already decided by the Greater East Asia Ministry. President Takashima, after taking office last time, thoroughly investigated the local situation and is currently returning to Beijing to select a specific adjustment plan. After Takashima and his colleagues take office, they will first start adjusting the two companies related to people's livelihoods.

(5) The second transfer of new enemy properties, foreign trade institutions, etc., will be implemented quickly from the perspective of enhancing production and promoting trade, fully considering the wishes of the Chinese side under the basic policy of Sino-Japanese cooperation.

### Japanese Troops on Attu Island Have Strong Morale, Counterattack American Forces Inflicting Heavy Casualties, Landing Troops on East Coast Completely Annihilated, American Forces on North Coast Reinforcing and Attempting to Advance South

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - After the American forces landed on Attu Island on the 12th of this month, the morale of the Japanese garrison on the island has been increasing, and they are currently conducting fierce counterattacks day and night. After the Americans landing on the east coast were annihilated, there are no enemy shadows in that area. However, the American forces are now gradually reinforcing the island. The Japanese garrison is continuing its fierce counterattacks in the eastern area positions. The American side's announcements regarding the battle situation on Attu Island are often based on Japanese announcements. According to what the American Secretary of the Navy Knox said when meeting with reporters on the 18th, the American forces landing at Holtz Bay (North Coast) and Massacre Bay (South Coast) are now attempting to converge, but they have suffered heavy casualties due to the fierce counterattacks by the Japanese forces. Enemy sources also widely circulated that the Japanese garrison's courageous counterattacks have resulted in heavier casualties for the American troops in this landing operation than on the South Pacific front.

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Major General Tanihagi, head of the Imperial Headquarters' press department, made the following statement today regarding the battle situation on Attu Island: (1) The main force of the enemy seems to have landed on the south coast of Attu Island, and its strength is gradually increasing. Since May 16th, tanks and heavy military supplies have been transported ashore. (2) The enemy forces landing on the north coast are increasing their strength daily and are currently advancing south, attempting to contact the forces landing on the south coast. (3) On the east coast, due to our army's brave counterattack on May 22nd, the enemy landing troops were annihilated, so there are no enemy shadows in that area. (4) The enemy's strength is about one division, guarded by a powerful fleet and air force, and equipped with tanks and heavy artillery. Our garrison withdrew its forward troops on the night of May 16th and defended the positions in the eastern area of the island, resisting the superior enemy with a small number of troops under fierce enemy artillery fire, counterattacking them and inflicting great damage. According to reports received from that area, the morale of our commanders and soldiers is extremely high, with a soaring spirit. The true spirit of the world's most elite Japanese army has been fully demonstrated.

### Possible Resumption of Diplomatic Relations between Soviet Union and Poland, New Polish Regime Reported to Appear, Sikorski's Political Enemies Now Emerging, Moscow May Fully Exploit Polish Communist Party

Stockholm, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to London news received by Swedish newspapers, the belief that a new Polish puppet government will be established is becoming more widespread, as Ms. Wassilewska, a political enemy of the Sikorski government, is gradually emerging. Minister of Information Kott, under the government led by Sikorski, recently criticized Ms. Wassilewska's personality, saying that she is a Polish Communist and has never engaged in any important activities in Poland. She only became active on the political stage because she married the journalist Konatczyk, who succeeded Molotov as Soviet Foreign Minister. Konatczyk is currently the Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union and has assisted her in establishing the purely communist "Polish Patriotic Alliance." Ms. Wassilewska is now an honorary colonel in the newly established Polish Second Army Corps. The leader of this corps, Colonel Berling, was awarded military rank when he stayed in Moscow to negotiate with the Communist Party. Berling is also a well-known Polish Communist, and his opposition to the London Polish government is no less than that of Ms. Wassilewska. According to the Svenska Dagbladet, since the publication of Kott's remarks, it has attracted the attention of people in London, who believe that if the Polish government does not reach an understanding with the Soviet Union, Moscow will fully exploit the Polish Communist Party. Sikorski is deeply afraid that the Soviet Union will establish a new Polish regime with Ms. Wassilewska as its leader, and is now exhausting his abilities to resolve the Soviet-Polish dispute satisfactorily.

### Both Britain and the United States Await Stalin's Reply

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - President Roosevelt said yesterday at a reception for newspaper reporters at the White House that the content of his letter to Stalin was not even known to Ambassador Davies, who delivered the letter. Only Roosevelt's personal secretary, Mr. O'Leary, knew the content of the letter. After reading the letter, Stalin seemed to be discussing its contents with Davies. Davies will return home immediately to report as soon as the discussion is over. At the same time, according to another report from Washington, Roosevelt and Churchill are continuing to meet to discuss the East Asian war situation. Observers generally believe that this shows that discussions on the European war cannot continue until the Soviet Union's attitude towards the smaller countries of Europe is clarified. According to reports, since Churchill gave a speech in the U.S. Congress, discussions on the East Asian issue have progressed more smoothly, as Churchill has agreed to the U.S. policy to strengthen the complex relationship between Britain and the United States. There are also rumors in Washington that Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov, who recently returned home, may be replaced by someone else.

Stockholm, 21st (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reported that Soviet newspapers have remained completely silent regarding Churchill's speech in the U.S. Congress and Roosevelt's personal representative Davies' visit to Moscow. Political figures in Berlin believe this is a noteworthy sign, and they point out that Stalin is apparently attempting to force Churchill and Roosevelt to make even greater concessions to the Soviet Union.

### Turkey Submits National Defense Budget to Parliament, Ambassador to Britain Returns Home to Discuss Important Issues

Ankara, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Yesterday, the Turkish government submitted a national defense budget of 120 million Turkish pounds to parliament. This expenditure will be part of the current fiscal year's budget.

Stockholm, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reported that the Turkish Ambassador to Britain arrived in Ankara on Thursday. He will likely discuss important issues with Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu.

### Fierce Artillery Battles Occur in the Donets River Region

Stockholm, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to front-line news, there has been no significant fighting between the German and Soviet armies for several weeks on the 510-mile Donets River front. Fierce artillery battles have suddenly broken out. According to a report in the Soviet newspaper Izvestia on the 21st, the two armies have launched preliminary battles to seize the Donets bridgehead in Izyum, Krasny Liman, Lisichansk, and other places. Air battles are also extremely fierce. According to German authorities, all Soviet offensives have been repulsed, especially with heavy losses of tanks. In addition, fierce artillery battles have also broken out in the Novorossiysk area. Also, large-scale naval and air battles were launched on the 21st in the waters along the Black Sea coast, but the Soviet army did not launch an offensive on land, so the two armies remain in a state of confrontation. According to the German News Agency, the Soviet army is continuing to concentrate its forces towards the east of Orel and the west of Kursk, attempting to move south in one fell swoop to recapture Kharkov, but the Soviet Red Star newspaper commented in an editorial on the 21st that the Soviet army should still adopt a defensive war in the summer campaign. If the Soviet army can stop the German offensive this summer, then victory will surely belong to the Soviet Union.

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The German Führer Headquarters released a battle situation communique on the 21st as follows: (1) There was small-scale fighting on the Eastern Front, with no significant changes. (2) The German Navy sank two Soviet transport ships in the waters off the Caucasus coast. (3) The German Air Force launched a fierce attack on the port of Bejaia on the Algerian coast. (4) In the Mediterranean, the German Air Force shot down eight enemy aircraft.

The Japanese Cabinet approved it on the 21st and announced it by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 22nd.

### Public Housing Construction in Makassar

Makassar, 22nd (Central News Agency) - In order to expand the city of Makassar and improve the health of the citizens, the local authorities have previously selected suitable areas to build residential housing and commercial streets for citizens. At the same time, in view of the lack of malaria prevention facilities in the homes of the indigenous people, they are studying the structure of improved beds to protect the indigenous people from epidemics. Also, in order to solve the housing problem, they are planning to build public housing for Japanese and indigenous people separately. All of these are measures that were not taken during the old Dutch administration and are quite promising.

### Penang Sends Young People to Japan to Investigate Industry

Penang, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The Penang government has been actively sending promising young people to Japan for observation. Recently, it was decided to select two Malay youths currently serving in the education, agriculture, and forestry departments of the government, who are scheduled to depart from here for Japan in mid-July to investigate and study the administrative and industrial conditions in Japan. Upon their return, they will serve as key officials in the Malay community.

### Air Supremacy and the Maritime War Situation (1)

— Translated by Kiichiro Sato from Kaizo, May Issue

One

At the start of World War I, the mission of aircraft was solely to scout enemy positions. When the German army attempted to break through the Liege fortress in Belgium to invade French territory at the beginning of the war, it was French aircraft that first discovered this attempt.

"Approximately ten German corps have invaded Belgium and are advancing rapidly towards Liege."

For the aircraft of that time, this was an extremely valuable report, but French Commander-in-Chief Joffre absolutely did not believe it. This was because he not only advanced directly without regard for the circumstances, underestimating the strength of the German army, but also only trusted the reconnaissance of 100,000 cavalrymen. However, at that time, this cavalry unit had not yet detected the German invasion of Belgium. This was the main reason for the French army's retreat at the beginning of the war.

By late August (1914), British aircraft discovered the German Second Army advancing from Brussels towards Grammont. In early September, they also scouted the movements of the German First Army in the Battle of the Marne, providing various important intelligence to headquarters. Learning from the previous fall of Liege, Joffre now believed the aircraft reports and used them as the basis for directing operations.

Conversely, an example of a situation where believing in aerial reconnaissance led to a favorable war situation was the Mortain counterattack, which occurred immediately after the Battle of the Marne. The German army facing the French Second Army led by Castelnau had moved its main force to the main battle front, leaving only a small number of troops. Therefore, Second Army aircraft scouted and discovered that the enemy had retreated 40 to 50 kilometers. Based on this report, Castelnau issued an advance order thirty minutes later, achieving victory at Mortain.

Although the equipment of aircraft at that time was incomplete and piloting techniques were still immature, they had already made undeniable contributions. However, precisely because aircraft were mainly focused on reconnaissance, combat and bombing did not appear as tactics in the early stages of the war. Later, when the battle lines became fixed and the two armies faced each other in trenches, aircraft reconnaissance became unnecessary, with artillery observation being the main task at most.

The emergence of bomber squadrons occurred in May 1915. As a flagship, four French battalions were created with the mission of bombing German military supply factories. Eighteen Voisin aircraft raided the Rottweil harbor factory, shocking the whole of Germany. In this initial bombing, the French army only lost one aircraft due to engine trouble.

Continuing to bomb Karlsruhe also yielded unexpected gains. The four bomber battalions were placed under the command of a single officer, and plans were made to operate exclusively outside French territory. Just as the French Air Force was about to reach the pinnacle of satisfaction, a sudden reversal occurred, and they were forced to fall into the depths of despair. German fighter planes suddenly appeared. When encountering fighter planes that were very fast, maneuverable, and nimble, French aircraft would immediately be hit by machine gun fire. When flying alone, falling behind in a squadron, or traversing air routes, the French army could not fly back. Long-distance flights seemed to require a terrible price for the French Air Force. In August of that year, nine bombers were shot down instantly during the bombing of Saarbrücken.

The bombers of the French Air Force, which had strutted about in the air, gradually declined in this way. Then, German fighter planes took their place, proudly waving their wings and reigning supreme over the skies. This was the first time in the history of world warfare that air supremacy had been seized.

Needless to say, the French Air Force immediately established fighter squadrons to counter this. However, the Battle of Verdun, which soon began, further cemented the German Air Force's air supremacy. The German army concentrated superior air power on the Verdun front. Upon seeing French aircraft, they dispatched fighter planes to drive them away from the battle lines, and mobilized artillery at the airfields to prevent them from landing.

Although the German Air Force was proud of its control of the skies over Verdun, the newly equipped French independent pursuit squadron regained air supremacy in the subsequent Battle of Saint-Mihiel. In a section of the German combat report on the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, there is the following statement:

"During the initial weeks of the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, we keenly felt the inferiority of our combat strength in aerial warfare. Enemy aircraft carried out long-range reconnaissance with complete freedom, and relying on their observation and scouting, enemy artillery completely overwhelmed our artillery."

The acquisition of air supremacy not only determined the superiority or inferiority of aircraft against aircraft, but also gave it a significant impact on the overall military operation. This has recently been mutually recognized by both armies. It is generally accepted that maintaining a strong fighter squadron is an indispensable element in combat. At the same time, the duties of a fighter squadron are clearly twofold: one is the offensive task of hindering the enemy's air squadron operations, and the other is the defensive task of ensuring the freedom of our reconnaissance aircraft.

However, by 1917, with the Battle of Arras as a turning point, air supremacy returned to the German army. The German army exerted great effort to improve the quality and increase the quantity of aircraft. It can be said that the actions of the French Air Force were almost completely suppressed. Witnessing barrage balloons being burned down by German fighter planes day after day, the French Air Force had no other option but to fly in formation at close range and at high and low altitudes, setting up safe zones in which they had no confidence, and struggling to operate their aircraft within them.

Not only that, but an event that can be described as a bolt from the blue for the weakening French Air Force was the German army's use of bombers at night. Previously, bombers were two-seater aircraft with very small carrying capacity, and night operations were limited to nights with a bright moon. Most terrifying was the summer of 1917, when new German bombers, with a carrying capacity of up to 600 kilograms, carried out air raids in the dark night with composure. In the dark of night, French airfields, barracks, train stations, factories, etc., were bombed everywhere, and the damage suffered increased day by day.

As a result, the French army was forced to disperse airfields, rebuild and re-equip bomber squadrons, and only gradually regained air supremacy by 1918.

Two

During World War I, air supremacy was controlled by the German army in a certain area for a certain period of time, and by the Allied forces in a certain area for a certain period of time. The ground situation also continued to advance and retreat accordingly, but air supremacy did not dominate the entire war situation as it does now. Needless to say, this was because the power of aircraft could not be compared with that of today, and the number was small. Moreover, even in terms of tactics, it had not yet gone beyond the initial stages.

Later, during the Spanish Civil War, aircraft from Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and other countries also fought each other. However, this war was just like a field test of aircraft from various countries. Without the awareness of wrestling in a national gymnasium, one would not truly participate in the air force. This is of course true.

Then, this great war broke out.

Regarding the air war results of the German army's launch of blitzkriegs in Poland at the beginning of this great war, followed by rushing into Belgium and the Netherlands, sweeping through France, occupying Norway, and attacking the Balkan Peninsula, it is not necessary to describe them in detail here. However, in order, it is necessary to briefly glance at the activities of the German Air Force in these operations, and to mention the significance of air supremacy for naval operations, which is the theme of this article.

On September 1 and 2, 1939, the German Air Force rapidly descended, concentrating bombings on 35 to 30 Polish airfields, destroying 45% of all Polish air power (calculated by France as 20%). In short, air supremacy had already been achieved on the first day of the war.

When advancing into the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France, the same tactics as in the Polish campaign were adopted. Before the ground forces, bombers were quickly dispatched, inflicting a fatal blow on the British and French air forces in just three days, seizing air supremacy on the western front. Now, let's combine the operational actions of the German Air Force:

1.  Achieve air supremacy by aerial combat or attacking air bases; next, occupy airfields and other strategic locations by airlifting troops and parachute units. At the same time, bomb aircraft factories and air defense facilities.

2.  Bomb railways, automobiles, and other ground transportation facilities, as well as ships and port facilities, to hinder the movement and concentration of the British and French armies.

3.  Cover mechanized units and closely coordinate with ground forces, bombing fortresses, armored vehicle units, ground troop deployments, headquarters locations, etc. The range is extremely wide, and when heavy artillery cannot attack, the power of bombers is increasingly demonstrated.

4.  Take all possible measures to protect friendly troop assembly areas and headquarters from Allied bombing.

5.  Attempt to shake the morale of the enemy's population by long-range bombing of industrial centers and densely populated areas.

On May 10, the first day of the offensive (1940), 100 airfields were bombed in one day. Up to June 5, when the offensive against Paris began, 2,100 enemy aircraft had been shot down or destroyed at airfields, and 1,250 in aerial combat. At this time, German aircraft generally attacked each airfield with 15 to 18 aircraft, mainly dropping 50-kilogram bombs.

In the face of such brilliant activity by the German Air Force, what did the British and French air forces do? Although the British and French air forces had to take the following actions, none of them were done very satisfactorily.

1.  Maintain air force operational capability;

2.  Connect with friendly ground forces on the front lines;

3.  Cooperate with ground air defense formations;

4.  Hinder enemy railway and road traffic;

5.  Bomb enemy munitions industrial areas and military facilities.

Moreover, the organizational strength of the entire army had shortcomings, and the comprehensive agility of action was lost. Only a part of the troops implemented one or two of the above-mentioned tasks.

On the first day of the war, the British and French soldiers, still asleep, lost 1,000 elite aircraft by evening, and morale was completely demoralized. This was one of the reasons for the failure on the western front; for the German army, it proved the success of the blitzkrieg. However, the British Air Force did not want to attack the German parachute units, but was busy bombing transportation facilities that were directly unrelated to the war situation. On the 12th, only 50 transport planes at the Malle airport and the airborne troops at an airport 12 kilometers north of Ypres were attacked. On the one hand, the French Air Force had already lost hope of rising on the first day, and the remaining scattered and incomplete old-fashioned bombers were attacked by the German Air Force. 300 aircraft were shot down or destroyed on the ground, and 70 in aerial combat. How can seizing air supremacy at the beginning of the war dominate the entire war situation? This is an excellent example.

### North China Disaster Relief Donations; Hoping For Speedy Transfers; Relief Work Cannot Be Delayed or Postponed

Since this newspaper began collecting donations for the North China famine relief, it has only been a few days. As of yesterday, it has collected more than 100,000 yuan. The enthusiasm for fundraising is admirable. However, considering that the distance to the destination is still far, and the need for relief funds is urgent, we once again appeal to all sectors in Shanghai with strong financial resources. Please generously contribute. As the saying goes, "Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda." Your small effort will greatly benefit the disaster victims in North China. We also hope that readers will contribute as much as they can to support this charitable cause. We believe that everyone will be happy to contribute to its success.

### Mr. Yan Qingxiang Generously Donates 20,000 Yuan

Mr. Yan Qingxiang of Sulun Yarn Factory deeply feels the severity of the disaster in North China. Millions of disaster victims are crying out for help. He is willing to donate 20,000 yuan to do his part in human mutual aid. In the maritime textile and dyeing industries, there is no shortage of enthusiastic people. Hearing the cries of the hungry, they share food. Seeing people shivering in the cold, they give clothing. There should be no shortage of people responding to Mr. Yan's call.

Typical Letter

Yesterday, we received a letter from all the colleagues of the Second Spinning Mill of Shenxin Textile, which said: "Our colleagues at this factory, in view of the severe disaster situation in North China, which cannot be delayed, and the enthusiastic fundraising by the public, all feel the urgency. As fellow countrymen, how can we sit idly by? Therefore, we specially come forward to respond to the public's righteous deeds. We have now collected a total of 1,285 yuan. This small amount is insignificant. Therefore, in addition to submitting the proceeds in full, we respectfully request that your newspaper publish a small item, with the intention of inspiring others to build a mountain out of sand. We respectfully hope that enthusiastic compatriots from all walks of life will quickly and enthusiastically contribute, for the sake of the dying disaster victims.

Short Commentary

### Welcome Ambassador Tani

Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masayuki, came to Shanghai soon after taking office. Yesterday, Minister Tajiri hosted a meeting for the city's elite to meet Ambassador Tani. While welcoming him, we sincerely offer three suggestions as a gesture of respect from the Chinese people to Ambassador Tani.

(1) Ambassador Tani was the Foreign Minister when Japan began implementing its new policy towards China and undoubtedly devoted much effort to the decision-making and implementation of the new policy. Now, as an envoy to China, he will undoubtedly make the greatest effort to promote cooperation between the two countries in the future. This is something to celebrate. However, we also believe that the diplomatic direction of the new era must take the voices of the residing people as the basis for its measures. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the people in the peace zone have remained silent for many years until the Japanese changed their policy towards China, and the people gradually revealed their innermost voices. We hope that Ambassador Tani will listen to these voices as much as possible, which is also the best opportunity to approach the Chinese people.

(2) At present, the relationship between China and Japan, especially between the people of China and Japan, has significantly improved. However, we cannot ignore the obstacles that still impede further improvement, especially the "minor details" that are easily overlooked. It is often heard from many Chinese and Japanese people: "The major policy has already changed, and minor details are irrelevant." However, we argue the opposite: "Major policies" and "minor obstacles" must be adjusted in parallel. "A small oversight can lead to a major error." This is the most unfortunate thing, and we hope Ambassador Tani will pay attention to this point.

(3) The various provinces in North China are currently suffering from severe famine and are in urgent need of relief. We have repeatedly pointed out that in the process of providing urgent relief, there are many areas where the Japanese authorities in China need to provide full convenience and assistance. We hope that Ambassador Tani will give extra sympathy and, in addition to requesting the local Japanese authorities to provide convenience in relief work, also encourage Japanese residents in China to generously donate so that the millions of disaster victims in North China will deeply appreciate the kindness of Ambassador Tani and the Japanese residents in China.

Economic Circles Welcome

### Change of Jurisdiction of the General Business Association to the Executive Yuan

Shanghai's economic circles have expressed great welcome to the change of jurisdiction of the General Business Association to the Executive Yuan, believing that in the past, not only was the action of the General Business Association subject to the command and supervision of the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Food, and other agencies, but the new trade associations were also directly organized by the two ministries. Because of this complicated guiding and supervising agency, the General Business Association became an intermediate agency. Since the establishment of the United Association and the Trade Association, it is urgent to adjust and clarify the supervision system so as to complete the mission of the General Business Association. The directors and supervisors of the General Business Association, in view of this situation, also submitted a request to the National Government to improve this point. The opinions of the General Business Association can represent the opinions of the entire financial community in Shanghai, so the National Government approved its request and implemented the adjustment, changing the jurisdiction of the General Business Association to the Executive Yuan. The economic circles of this city unanimously support this. Since the General Business Association is under the control of the Executive Yuan, it is expected that its directors and supervisors will also be re-elected and the internal organization will be adjusted at an appropriate time.

It is believed that the future autonomous organizational work of the General Business Association will adapt to reality. If the organizational policy is inconsistent with reality, it will be detrimental to the promotion of the new control work. In principle, there is an absolute need for reform, but it cannot be rushed and must be done gradually. In short, this change of jurisdiction to the Executive Yuan has removed the obstacles to the organizational work of the General Business Association and will surely have the possibility of rapid development.

### Banking Industry's Various Banks and Firms Move Idle Capital to Revive the Countryside

The various banks and firms in the banking industry, in view of the fact that since the establishment of the National General Business Association, the transportation of goods in various places, except for the provision that major goods must be transported with import and export certificates, all un-controlled goods can be transported freely, in order to promote the active exchange of funds between Shanghai and the interior, are carrying out the following matters:

Adjust Exchange Rates

Adjust the domestic exchange rate to make it simple and convenient, and try to do as much as possible to directly facilitate the allocation of funds in various places. The purpose of reducing the exchange rate is to reduce the remittance burden on the people and commercial institutions, and at the same time seek the healthy development of the economy of Central China. The circulation of Central Reserve Notes has penetrated into various places, and the consolidation of the financial foundation is to guide the idle capital in Shanghai into the interior to revive the rural economy, so various conveniences are provided for domestic exchange. Recently, as the spring cocoon of Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been put on the market, a large amount of funds has flowed from Shanghai to the interior for the purpose of purchasing spring cocoons. At the same time, the arrival of wheat in the interior is not far away, and the inflow of funds will inevitably increase. It is also heard that a large amount of exchange must explain the proper purpose, such as purchasing agricultural products, etc., the purpose is to prevent the congestion of funds in the interior.

Deposits Increase Sharply

Since the Banking Association issued a notice to tighten interbank lending and advised member banks and firms to maintain their strength to ensure safety, all banks and firms have strengthened their own preparations for sound operation, and are extremely cautious in all lending, whether collateral, credit, or overdraft. Therefore, the deposits of member banks and firms of the Banking Association have become increasingly abundant. Taking March of this year as an example, it was 805,743,172.53 yuan, 545,833,891.46 yuan in the same month of the 31st year, 190,875,076.05 yuan in the same month of the 30th year, 76,883,911.90 yuan in the same month of the 29th year, 86,894,324.42 yuan in the same month of the 28th year, 59,318,462.56 yuan in the same month of the 27th year, 96,192,401.13 yuan in the same month of the 26th year, and 103,099,694.70 yuan in the same month of the 25th year. (Note: Before June of the 31st year, the old currency was used as the standard, and the Central Reserve Notes was used as the standard after that.)

### Central China Electric Company's Seventh Shareholders Meeting

### Cotton, Hemp, Wool, and Leather Listed as Controlled Products

The Materials Control Review Committee of the General Business Association, at its meeting the day before yesterday (20th), in view of the fact that the control organizations for eleven materials, including wheat, flour, miscellaneous grains, oils and fats, raw cotton yarn, cloth, livestock, soap, candles, matches, sugar, and tobacco, have been organized and completed, but cotton, hemp, wool, and leather have not been included in the scope of controlled products in the past, it was resolved to request the General Business Association to add them to the list. At the same time, the General Business Association will promptly organize the control organizations for the above four materials.

### Flour and Wheat Professional Committee Actively Organizes Internal Agencies Organization of Oil and Grain Professional Committee Still Under Consideration

The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the General Business Association, after its establishment the other day, it is learned that the committee is currently actively setting up various internal organizations. The personnel of its organizations are generally Chinese and Japanese flour and wheat merchants, mainly Chinese merchants and supplemented by Japanese merchants. It is heard that the organizational rules and regulations of the committee are about to be drafted.

Chinese Flour Mills Prepare to Resume Operations

It is also learned that Chinese flour mills have been suspended for a long time. After entering the new economic stage this time, various flour mills also intend to prepare to start flour production because Chinese flour and wheat merchants can participate in the work of collecting wheat. It is learned that currently, the Bifeng Flour Mill is planning to resume operations.

Oil and Grain Professional Committee Still Under Consideration

In addition, the news that the General Business Association intends to set up an Oil and Grain Committee and that the organizational system has been basically decided was reported in various newspapers the day before yesterday. According to the association, the General Business Association is still considering whether the oil and grain industry needs to organize a professional committee. Because the establishment of a professional committee must be approved by the General Business Association, the above news was not a misunderstanding.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, the decline of Chinese stocks became increasingly strong. In a wave of selling, the prices of various stocks fell sharply across the board. The department store industry was still the most volatile, and Wing On Company has fallen into the Guan Nei area. There were not many transactions for Sincere and Guohuo, and the price also fell slightly. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile also entered the Guan Nei area, and Mayer Silk Factory was slightly lower. The supply of underwear exceeded demand and also saw a decline. Greater China Match rose and fell back, and the buying trend of the past two days dissipated. Nanyang and Huacheng Silk Companies both quoted lower prices. There were few transactions for Commercial Press, Chung Hwa, and World Book Company, and there were also few sellers, so the decline was still minor. Zhabei Water and Electricity and Huashang Electric also saw a decline. Jiu'an Industrial was flat and tired. Xinyi Real Estate had a relatively large squeeze. China United Film had supply but no demand. Small-denomination textile stocks were also in decline. Only the Jinfu Shirt Machine Factory and Tongyi Trust, two new stocks that had just entered the market, had transaction prices even higher than the previous day, and transactions were also brisk. As for Zhongfang and Xinhuo stocks, it is heard that they will soon be officially opened for trading in the Chinese stock market.

### Supply of Soap Raw Materials Continues

The price of soap in this city was previously manipulated, and the price was much higher than the limit price, which caused great inconvenience to the citizens. Later, after the supply of raw materials for making soap, such as coconut oil, continued, various soap factories resumed production and manufactured a large number of products, resulting in a halt to the rising price of soap on the market. Recently, after the implementation of the new economic policy, the source of raw materials for making soap has become more convenient, and the output of soap can also become more abundant, resulting in a continuous decline in the retail price of soap in recent days.

### The Life of a Bank Clerk

— Ji Xiaoshang

In the past, the profession of a bank clerk was regarded as a superior position with a "silver rice bowl" that many people envied and many soon-to-graduate young students hoped to obtain; however, today, it is absolutely impossible for a bank clerk to support a family with all his salary and allowances. The comparison between the past and the present makes people sigh.

I work in a commercial bank with a long history and a large scale, with a monthly salary of sixty yuan (most of the clerks in the entire bank have a monthly salary of sixty yuan). Together with allowances, the total monthly income is 900 yuan, and the bank provides free lunch. There are three people in my family, and we don't hire a nanny. The minimum monthly expenditure is 1,500 yuan, and the situation of income not meeting expenditure is obvious.

This expenditure of 1,500 yuan includes rent, water and electricity bills, transportation expenses, food, coal balls, cooking oil, sugar, salt, soap, toilet paper, etc., as well as "human relations" during weddings and funerals among relatives and friends. We have no entertainment expenses, we don't buy clothes, shoes, or socks, and we don't buy books or magazines, but we only buy one Shen Bao newspaper to read every day. Occasionally, when we have minor illnesses such as colds, coughs, headaches, or fever, we don't seek medical treatment, but at most buy a few aspirins or quinine pills to take. We feel that we have saved as much as possible, but the fact that income cannot meet expenditure is undeniable and unavoidable.

In addition to working in the bank, I do not hold other positions, so I have no other income. My leisure activities are: reading, writing articles, washing clothes, visiting relatives and friends, and walking on the road, that's all, and I don't waste any money. I get my hair cut twice a month, and I don't think I can save any more!

Some colleagues also do business or trade stocks to earn some "extra money"; however, I don't have this kind of "extra money" to earn. The reasons are: first, I don't have any capital, and my family's financial situation is very poor; second, I don't want to do speculative hoarding.

For daily necessities, such as soap, toilet paper, oil, sugar, salt, coal balls, etc., I only buy them when I need them, and I never buy a month's or several months' worth in advance. On the one hand, buying in advance will inevitably promote the trend of hoarding. On the other hand, I hope that prices will gradually fall. Unexpectedly, prices not only did not fall due to the authorities' announcement of strict suppression, but instead continued to rise. Seeing that some colleagues bought several months' worth of daily necessities and saved a lot of money, I felt regret in my heart and was even blamed by my old mother when I returned home, saying: "I told you to buy a little more, but you didn't listen. Look, it's gone up again now!" I think: It's really not easy to be a person, and it's even harder to be a law-abiding and dutiful person!
