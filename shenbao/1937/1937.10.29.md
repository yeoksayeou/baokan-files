### The Enemy's Attempt to Cross the Zhoujia Bridge Failed; Fierce Battle Ensued for an Entire Day in the Zhenru and Jiangqiao Areas

Our Covering Forces Have Safely Reached the Southern Bank of the Suzhou Creek; Enemy Forces Advanced Again in the Guangfu Area but Were Repelled by Our Forces; Our Air Force Sortied to Bombard Enemy Positions, Inflicting Heavy Damage; Eight Hundred Isolated Troops Still Hold Their Ground, Unwilling to Retreat

Our army's right-wing units, due to strategic considerations, were ordered to abandon key points such as Dachang, Jiangwan, and Zhabei and retreat to new positions, holding the opportunity to counterattack. As of yesterday evening, except for the Zhabei area, where more than a battalion of troops remained, vowing to defend the national territory and refusing to withdraw, all other units responsible for covering the retreat had reached their designated locations, and the deployment of new positions was also declared complete. The following is a record of the battles and situations on various fronts yesterday: ㊀ The isolated troops in Zhabei are still stationed in the Four Banks Warehouse, waiting for an opportunity to kill the enemy. Although the enemy has devised various schemes and conspiracies, they have been unable to advance due to the solid defenses of our army and have never dared to move rashly. Yesterday, various sectors made many efforts to transport comfort items, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce specially made a national flag and transferred it to our army to hang on the roof of the seven-story building, in order to express the maintenance of the great national character of the Republic of China. ㊁ The covering forces of our army in the Pengpu Township and Zhenru Town areas broke through the enemy's encirclement yesterday and reached the southern bank of the Suzhou Creek. When our army retreated into the new positions in the Beixinjing area north of the Henan, the enemy thought that our army had not gained a firm foothold and took the opportunity to advance south, attempting to forcibly cross the river in the Zhoujia Bridge area. Our army saw through their trick and had made preparations early. When they arrived along the north bank, they were immediately met with a head-on blow from our army, killing a large number of them. The enemy immediately collapsed and retreated. Subsequently, the enemy gathered firepower and launched a fierce attack on our army on the south bank. At the same time, more than a dozen enemy planes flew to the skies over the Beixinjing area, bombing indiscriminately, with the aim of destroying our fortifications on the south bank and covering their infantry to cross the river again. However, our army calmly fought back and remained unmoved. The fierce battle lasted until night, and the enemy, unable to achieve their goals, gradually reduced their fighting. ㊂ The line from Jiangqiao Town to Xiaonxiang has been completely connected by our army, and the fortifications on this line are also extremely solid. Therefore, the enemy army continuously attacked our streets from yesterday morning to evening, but all were firmly blocked by our army. However, the attacks became more fierce after dusk, and fierce battles often broke out. As of 1:00 AM this morning, the fighting was still intense. ㊃ Guangfu Town is still being firmly defended by our army. Yesterday, the enemy army bombarded fiercely with artillery throughout the day, but the infantry never dared to move rashly. There was no change in Chengqiao Town. The Liuhe area was as peaceful as ever. ㊄ Our air force, about several teams, was ordered to sortie to assist in the battle. Starting at 8:00 PM last night, they went to various enemy positions to drop bombs and bombed them all night until dawn, when they completed their mission and returned safely. In addition, our Pudong artillery also fired twice to fight with the enemy ships on the Huangpu River.

A war correspondent from the Central News Agency reported at 12:00 AM on the 28th that on the line from Zhoujia Bridge to Beixinjing on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek in western Shanghai, the enemy was holding each other across the river. In the afternoon of this day, the battle gradually eased. The enemy is reorganizing their troops and building fortifications on the north bank. It is expected that there will be a lull of three to five days, but the battle is very fierce on the line from Jiangqiao to Xiaonxiang.

### The Isolated Troops in Zhenru Bravely Broke Through the Encirclement and Have Retreated to the Southern Bank of the Suzhou Creek

Our Forces in Pengpu Have Also Safely Crossed the River

A war correspondent from the Central News Agency reported at 8:20 PM on the 28th that a part of our army near Zhenru was covering the retreat of the main force and was surrounded by enemy troops on the evening of the 26th. They gathered in the town to resist. The enemy launched repeated attacks, but all were repelled. The enemy then used aircraft to drop bombs and set fire to the surrounding area, but our army remained unmoved in the flames. Yesterday morning, the enemy launched fierce attacks from the northeast, and fierce battles broke out again. Our army held the determination to die, so they fought bravely and fired with fortifications, killing many enemies. After a bloody battle until the afternoon, our army also suffered considerable casualties, and enemy planes continued to drop bombs, turning the entire town into ruins. Therefore, they gradually withdrew from the town to the south, charging at the risk of death, and finally our army fought a bloody path to the Suzhou Creek. As of the report, all had retreated to the southern bank of the Suzhou Creek.

A war correspondent from the Central News Agency reported at 12:45 PM on the 28th that Pengpu Town is still being firmly defended by our army and has established contact with Tanziawan along the Suzhou Creek. Therefore, although surrounded by enemy troops, they still fought desperately and engaged in street battles with the enemy. From last night to this afternoon, landmines exploded in several places, and the enemy army suffered heavy casualties.

Our covering troops defended various key points, calmly fought back, and launched a charge once, killing more than 300 enemies. After dispersing the enemy, they retreated calmly and arrived safely in the Beixinjing area of the second line of defense at around 5:30 PM.

### The Enemy's Attack on Zhoujia Bridge Failed

They Attempted to Cross the River There but Were Repelled by Our Forces; Enemy Planes and Artillery Fiercely Bombarded Beixinjing

After a lull in the fighting, our army moved southwest from the Zhabei and Jiangwan areas and retreated safely to the southern bank of the Suzhou Creek, following the predetermined plan and equipped as early as the previous day, and then moving south in order from the警戒line, which is adjacent to the western district of the concession, and abandoning Datong University. After the enemy's naval marines occupied the limbs, they attempted to cross the river in the Zhoujia Bridge area at dawn yesterday. After our army calmly fought back under the artillery fire and swept them with machine guns, the enemy was finally unable to succeed.

A war correspondent from the Central News Agency reported at 8:20 PM on the 28th that the enemy army on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek attempted to cross the river to attack the south at dawn, firing and harassing our Zhoujia Bridge area. Our army also calmly fought back, and there was a very dense exchange of fire for a time. Then the enemy saw that we were prepared, so they retreated. At the moment, our army is defending the south bank of the Suzhou Creek from the west side of the concession, occupying the Toyota Yarn Factory, Zhoujia Bridge, and the Bailinan Road area, and has established contact with Jiangqiao Town, with a very solid front line. The railway bridge and Zhongshan Bridge on the river have been completely destroyed by our army, and it is very difficult for the enemy army to fly over. At dawn yesterday, the sound of artillery fire in western Shanghai was very dense. The enemy army on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek bombarded our coast in the Beixinjing area and enemy planes dropped bombs indiscriminately, but our fortifications were not damaged at all.

### The Enemy's Advance in the Guangfu Area Was Repelled by Our Forces

Close Contact on the Line from Xiaonxiang to Jiangqiao Town; Solidified Positions

Central News Agency, Suzhou, 27th dispatch: There was also a fierce battle in the Guangfu Shixianggong Temple area on the morning of the 27th. However, the enemy's actions here were intended to contain our forces, so after we counterattacked, the enemy retreated immediately, and our army did not pursue them.

A war correspondent from the Central News Agency in Guangfu reported at noon on the 28th that the battle situation north of Guangfu was quiet from the evening of the 27th to the morning of the 28th. However, the enemy's large artillery and planes were still carrying out their acts of destruction, bombing our entire line of positions. The planes especially circled around and would not leave. Our army calmly dealt with them and maintained strict vigilance.

After a lull in the fighting, the enemy army gradually advanced southwest from Dachang Zhabei, attempting to attack our warning positions in Jiangqiao Town. Therefore, they bombarded fiercely with artillery from the night before, and there was also fierce artillery fire in the Xiaonxiang area. After dawn yesterday, enemy planes in groups bombed and bombed towns such as Nanxiang, and almost no civilian houses were intact. However, our army still calmly defended, and the troops in Xiaonxiang and Jiangqiao have established close contact, and the Chen line is solid. If the enemy comes to attack, it will be difficult for them to succeed.

### Eight Hundred Isolated Troops Are Safe and Sound; Our Brave Soldiers Raised the National Flag High

The Food Warehouse Is as Strong as a Fortress; The Enemy's Attack Failed; Righteous People Made Efforts Yesterday to Supply Food

The eight hundred brave soldiers of the 88th Division Xie Regiment, who fought bravely and were willing to make a heroic sacrifice, were still led by Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan and Battalion Commander Yang Ruifu yesterday, and they defended the Four Banks Warehouse to the death. The entire army is safe and sound. Before yesterday evening, our loyal and brave soldiers raised the national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth on the roof of the six-story building, overwhelming the surrounding Japanese flags, and promoting the righteousness and supreme glory of our great Chinese nation. The heroic and righteous actions of these eight hundred loyal and brave soldiers have won the infinite admiration of people from all walks of life in Shanghai and abroad, and have aroused the most enthusiastic attention, and the development of the frontline battle has become a secondary concern.

Determined to Defend to the Death Before Retreating

The first thing the reporter should report to compatriots is that these eight hundred loyal and brave soldiers of the entire regiment, although in a dangerous situation surrounded by smoke and enemy soldiers, are not only in high spirits and enthusiasm, but also in a very calm and leisurely state. Yesterday morning, the British army stationed there made another effort to advise our loyal and brave soldiers to disarm and retreat into the concession. Although our loyal and brave soldiers were extremely grateful for the British army's friendly intentions, they had decided to defend the precious last position to the death, to shed the last drop of hot blood and make the most glorious sacrifice, so they firmly refused again. Yesterday, they tried to send out many letters, asking for them to be mailed, because they were all wills.

Calm Attitude and Raising the National Flag High

At about 5:00 PM yesterday, the reporter went to the top of a high-rise building on the southern bank of the Suzhou Creek again to observe the movements on the other side. At this time, there were countless Chinese and foreigners on the roofs and windows of nearby buildings making the same observations. The Four Banks Food Warehouse and the adjacent Continental Bank Warehouse on the other side were clearly visible. On the roof of the six-story building, which is about 50 yards long, there is a machine gun stand, which is for dealing with attacking enemy planes. There are about 10 of our brave soldiers on the roof, sometimes inspecting in groups to detect the enemy's movements, sometimes gathering together to talk and laugh, and discuss something. Their attitude is calm and leisurely, without any haste or panic. As the sun was about to set in the west, our loyal and brave soldiers suddenly raised the national flag high on the roof, fluttering in the wind, making the surrounding Japanese flags pale in comparison. This scene was inspiring and tearful.

Righteous People Transport Food

The day before yesterday evening, these eight hundred loyal and brave soldiers issued a heroic appeal, asking for the supply of sugar, salt, and light cakes, so that there would be no shortage of food and they could defend to the death. Yesterday, citizens automatically transported various foods, and those who planned to go to supply them were constantly on the road, but because the enemy army was scattered everywhere, they could not pass, and they were all extremely frustrated. A German woman loaded a large number of calcium packages into a car and transported them, entrusting the British army to forward them, and said that she was willing to continuously supply all the food for these eight hundred brave soldiers, but the traffic was cut off and the effort failed. However, during this period of full-scale resistance, our rear-area people have formed a united front with the frontline soldiers, so in an environment of great difficulty, some righteous people finally achieved the goal of transporting food.

As Solid as a Fortress and Can Be Used for Firm Defense

Yesterday morning, several enemy planes flew to the sky and hovered. Our loyal and brave soldiers immediately fired machine guns to drive them away. At about 3:00 PM, a part of the enemy army went to attack again, but they only fired from a distance and did not dare to approach. Many of the floor slopes and windows were broken. Our loyal and brave soldiers valued firearms and ammunition more than life. Seeing no traces of the enemy army, they did not retaliate. The Four Banks Warehouse and the Continental Warehouse can be connected by tiles and are constructed of steel and concrete, as solid as a fortress and can be used for firm defense. The fire doors have been piled up with sandbags, and fortifications have been built at both ends, so it is not easy for the enemy army to rush in. It is said that the enemy army has set up a 3-inch caliber artillery position nearby, intending to bombard, but we are also fearless. The enemy army has also used arson, causing the surrounding houses to be reduced to ashes, but the Four Banks Warehouse still stands unmoved. Our loyal and brave soldiers want to ask the enemy army to pay the price in order to fulfill their ambition to sacrifice themselves for righteousness, and they will be rewarded.

### The People in the Rear Area Are Enthusiastically Concerned

After the news of our brave soldiers defending to the death and refusing to retreat spread, Chinese and foreigners who went to the area of North Xizang Road yesterday to see the situation were constantly on the road all day long. However, the enemy army north of the river fired sporadic bullets from time to time, causing stray bullets to fly everywhere, and the danger was extremely great. The British army stationed there has closed the New Rubbish Bridge and placed barbed wire at the intersection of North Xizang Road and Xinzha Road to prevent traffic. However, those who stood and watched were densely packed and never dispersed, which shows the concern of the people in the rear area for our loyal and brave soldiers.

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, considering that the troops gathered in the stack of the Zhabei Four Banks Savings Society are determined to fight to the death and coexist with the position, and their loyalty and bravery are commendable, took the risk to present a national flag of the Republic of China yesterday afternoon, which was sent by the 41st Girl Scout of this city, asking them to hang it on the roof to promote the spirit of the army's sacrifice for the country. At the same time, they sent letters to Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan and Battalion Commander Yang Duanfu, expressing their admiration. The Youth National Salvation Service Corps also sent letters of condolence, and various groups and institutions in this city sent condolences one after another, including the Citizens' United Association, Renhe Hospital, colleagues in the accounting department of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, Gongmao Salt Shop, residents of various households in Hongfu Lane, Renji Hospital, Xiehe Foreign Company, Daguan Garden Bathhouse, Wufeng Dye Factory, Mingxing Printing Department, colleagues in Sanyang, and Wang Dingzhen, Wu Meipei, Dai Zulin, and Lu Hejun, etc. In addition, there are colleagues from the China Commercial Bank, etc. Among the food, the most common are anti-enemy biscuits, fruits, edible salt, soy sauce, and canned food, etc. Foreigners in this port also sent bread, candy, and tap water yesterday, which shows that our loyal and brave soldiers, who are guarding alone and regard death as home, have won the infinite admiration of Chinese and foreigners and are enough to shine on the world and be immortal.

### Foreign Newspapers Unanimously Praised the Spirit of Our Army's Resistance

The Retreat of Our Shanghai Army Is Not a Victory for the Japanese Army; It Will Be Difficult for Japan to Obtain Pleasant Results in Future Continued Battles

The Times

Central News Agency, London, 28th dispatch, Reuters: The Times' editorial today commented on the latest scene in the Shanghai battle, saying that if the Japanese army wants to turn the partial and planned retreat of the Chinese army in Shanghai into a total collapse, it will probably feel exhausted. The Japanese army's greatest and only goal is to destroy the Chinese army and make it no longer have strong and effective combat power. If this goal cannot be achieved, the land will not be of much importance even if it is obtained. As far as we know at present, the Japanese army has not made much progress towards this goal. Even if the Japanese army has killed 200,000 Chinese soldiers, many of whom may be the elite troops led by Nanjing, even if the Shanghai battle will not be prolonged after this, it may not be the case. However, the ten weeks of bloody battles in Shanghai will one day prove that it has placed the foundation of an unprecedented military force in China. Chinese soldiers have now emerged from the mist of farcical stories. This is the first time in modern history. Although most Chinese soldiers are still insufficiently trained and poorly equipped, and still carry umbrellas with them because they are unable to provide raincoats, they have held a position that people believe cannot be held for a week for ten weeks. We will see here that the resistance of the Chinese army in Shanghai will have a spiritual impact throughout China, not only today but also in the future.

Daily Mail

Central News Agency, London, 28th dispatch, Reuters: The Daily Mail commented on the Shanghai battle, saying that Japan's victory this time can preserve its prestige, and China's brave resistance for more than 70 days can also be proud of. At this point, both sides can accept a truce without shame. Unfortunately, neither side seems to be willing to express their willingness to cease fire. We hope that before the arrival of the cold winter, foreign mediation can make both sides accept the scope. If the war does not stop, there will be a danger of the Soviet Union joining the war and spreading the war. We can rely on the mutual country conference to use the greatest efforts of true communication and mediation to make the peace achieved in the end.

News Chronicle

Central News Agency, London, 28th dispatch, Havas: Regarding the war between China and Japan, the News Chronicle, a Shanxi newspaper, recently added an editorial, still advocating boycotting Japanese goods. It said, "The Chinese army's enthusiastic resistance in Shanghai is really only seen in the history of any country. The British and American troops stationed in Shanghai can only watch the barbaric war waged by Japan, and it is true that they admire the heroic Chinese army very much. In the future, the Japanese army will continue to fight, and the further away from the country's warships, the more difficult it will be. Examining the various wars in the world, both sides involved have some justified reasons, but there is not a single word that can be forgiven for Japan in this conflict between China and Japan. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference should be opened immediately. At that time, the representatives of various countries should take a strong stand to maintain the rule of law in each country and lead the world to boycott Japanese goods in order to force the country to 'kneel' and not invade China. In short, civilized countries should do something to resist the act of aggression and maintain an ideal, at least as equal to what the ordinary soldiers in China are doing."

The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury

The editorial of the English Evening Post & Mercury of this city on the evening of the 28th, entitled "Where Lies Victory", originally stated, "After 76 days of bloody resistance, the inevitable retreat of Zhabei by the Chinese army has finally been realized. People around the world are amazed at how long the Chinese army has held Zhabei. It is true that the Chinese army's indomitable tenacity and burning patriotism have undergone a glorious test. We have witnessed the heroic spirit of the Chinese army in Zhabei in 1937 and will always leave a deep impression in our minds. This is a victory for Japan but not a real victory. Since the beginning of the Shanghai war, this newspaper has pointed out that the Yangtze River coast is difficult to defend for a long time, because the invaders can use warships and artillery to bombard it, and it is difficult for even strongly defended troops to hold it firmly. During the Shanghai War in 1932, the Japanese army was able to detour and flank, causing the heroic 19th Route Army to withdraw to the interior. This time, the Chinese army's front line was longer and stronger than before, and the Japanese army's flanking was no longer possible, but the Chinese army's front line finally moved with the North Station as the axis. Even after a longer period of resistance, it still resulted in a retreat. The reason why the Chinese army finally withdrew from the North Station was not due to the direct attack by the Japanese army, but because the Japanese army broke into the northwest area, making the Chinese army at risk of being cut off. The Chinese army's bravery in combat is unprecedented and will be immortalized in history. The isolated army's defense of Zhabei is especially admired by the world. It will take several days to understand the battle routes of both sides, because this situation is very different from that in 1932. At that time, the war ended after the Chinese army retreated, but this time, the war zone has expanded and the war will inevitably be more intense. (Omission) Both sides have been fighting bloodily for two and a half months. Those who have suffered heavy damage are non-combatants. This is the harvest of the Japanese mad imperialists carrying out acts of aggression in China. Japan's attempt to seek friendship has resulted in the Chinese people's hatred and seeking commercial prosperity has cost millions of military expenses. The next two attacks will also have some pleasant results.

### The Fall of Dachang; Division Commander Zhu Commits Suicide

Dying to Thank the Country

A war correspondent from the Central News Agency reported at 8:20 PM on the 28th that Division Commander Zhu Yaohua led his troops to defend the position west of Dachang. Although he resisted desperately in the face of the enemy's attack, he was finally broken through, which affected the Shanghai war situation. Feeling unable to face the officers and comrades, he committed suicide with a pistol this afternoon to thank the people of the country.

### The Enemy's Casualties Since August 13 Have Reached More Than 70,000

Central News Agency, Suzhou, 28th dispatch: According to reliable information from the crystal merchant, the casualties of the enemy's army, navy, and air force in the Shanghai war since August 13 have reached more than 72,000, including about 35,000 casualties of the regular troops of the 5th Division, 6th Division, and 8th, 9th, 11th, 12th, and 15th Divisions, about 11,000 casualties of the Taiwanese-Korean army, about 17,800 casualties of the puppet Manchu army, and about 8,900 casualties of the marines of the 2nd Fleet and the 5th, 10th, and 11th Fleets.

### Japanese Planes Flew Near the British Defense Zone; British Soldiers Fired in Fierce Attack

The Critique of the North-China Daily News

The North-China Daily News of this city said that when a large Japanese bomber finally attacked the Chinese army position at the railway intersection near Great Western Road on the morning of the 27th, the British army defense zone on凱旋路 fired at the Japanese plane 140 times, but because the Japanese plane was flying very high, none of them hit. U.S. military authorities warned Japanese authorities on the 25th that if any Japanese planes endangered the British army defense zone in the future, the British army would immediately open fire. Furthermore, since the incident of a British soldier being killed by a Japanese plane on凯旋路, the British soldiers have installed a high-射炮架 there to place machine guns for high-射 firing. Also, after a Japanese plane dropped three bombs between the British soldier's Q defense zone at the corner of敦信路 and凯旋路 and the British soldier's defense zone on Great Western Road, the British soldiers' PQOM four defense zones simultaneously opened machine guns. One of the bombs dropped by the Japanese plane fell only 100 yards away from the British soldier's defense zone on Great Western Road, and another bomb was only a few feet away from other British soldier's defense zones. Fortunately, there was no one on duty at the defense zones on Great Western Road and悼信路 at the time, so no disaster occurred. It is said that a Japanese plane suddenly dived down near the British soldier's defense zone on the 27th, and the British soldiers defending Great Western Road immediately swept the Japanese plane with machine guns. Then the British officer on凯旋路 also ordered the British soldiers in the four defense zones to open fire at the Japanese plane. For a time, the sound of gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls. The British soldiers fired a total of 40 shots. At the same time, the Chinese army defense zone across from Great Western Road also swept the Japanese plane with machine guns and rifles. The Japanese plane then fled in panic. Also, a British officer told a reporter from the North-China Daily News that "Whenever a Japanese plane endangers the British soldier's defense zone, we will order the British soldiers to open fire. At that time, the Japanese plane was just starting to attack the Chinese army position, only a few hundred yards away from our defense zone, so I ordered the four defense zones to open fire. Fortunately, when the Japanese 南炸弹 fell near the British soldier's P defense zone, there was no one there to be hit, but the spot where the bomb fell was very close and was already unsettling." Also, according to Japanese sources, one Japanese seaplane was hit at 8:30 AM on the 27th in湾西 and crashed west of Zhongshan Road on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek.

### Report by the British Foreign Secretary in the House of Commons on the Incident's Course

[London] During yesterday afternoon's session of the House of Commons, Sir O'Neill, a Conservative Member of Parliament, questioned Foreign Secretary Eden about the case of a British soldier killed by a Japanese aircraft near the Kaixuan Road in Shanghai. Eden immediately replied, "Following the incident, the Japanese government sent a note to the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, offering a formal apology and expressing willingness to punish those responsible and compensate for losses. The British government promptly instructed Ambassador Craigie to accept the apology and assurances, while also declaring that the British soldiers' retaliatory measures against the Japanese aircraft were entirely justified." (Members of Parliament greeted the statement with cheers.) "Should a similar incident occur in the future, it will be dealt with in the same manner." O'Neill further asked, "Will the Japanese government provide adequate compensation to the families of the deceased British soldiers?" Eden replied in the affirmative.

[Taiyuan] The enemy in eastern Shanxi, failing in repeated attacks, concentrated their forces on the 26th and 27th against our right flank near Guyi (near Jiuguan), launching assaults under cover of heavy artillery and tanks. Our troops, having valiantly resisted the enemy for days, suffered many casualties. Although reinforcements arrived, they were subjected to fierce attacks before they could establish a firm foothold. Nevertheless, they bravely resisted, but were eventually overwhelmed by the enemy's heavy artillery fire, which destroyed most of the fortifications, leading to a breakthrough at one point. Taking advantage of this opening, the enemy infiltrated, and our troops, unable to defend the original position, had no choice but to retreat slightly. With Guyi having been breached, Niangziguan was now behind Guyi geographically, and a retreat was also inevitable. Our troops have now retreated and regrouped in the Yangquan area, setting up new defensive positions. With the battle lines shortened, our forces can be concentrated to continue the resistance.

The ensuing struggle was extremely fierce, with the positions changing hands several times. Ultimately, thanks to the valor of our officers and soldiers, the heights were retaken by our forces. The enemy stubbornly defending the left flank launched fierce attacks on Jiacun to our southwest from the afternoon of the 27th.

The guerilla unit led by ××× has been very active in the Pingshan and Lingshou areas in recent days, posing a significant threat to the Japanese forces east of Niangziguan. (Express News dispatch, 28th)

[Nanjing] According to the Chinese military authorities, who informed the Associated Press today, the entire northern front of the Chinese army was ordered to launch a counter-offensive yesterday. Consequently, fierce fighting has broken out along the Jinpu and Pinghan Railways. The Chinese forces north of Shanxi are currently advancing north. Military sources confirm that the vanguard of the Chinese army on the Pinghan Railway advanced to the vicinity of Handan yesterday morning and recovered Feixiang at dawn. Chinese guerrilla units are now scattered in the Daming and Guangping areas, attacking the Japanese forces stationed in Handan.

### A Russian Employee of the Beiping Post Office Was Arrested; The Japanese Used Torture to Force Him to Confess

Pressuring Him to Reveal the Location of the Postage Stamp Steel Plate

[Nanjing] According to a report by Li Qi (a foreigner), a senior official of the China Postal Administration, the Japanese authorities in Beiping are planning to issue postage stamps in various provinces of North China. As a result, a White Russian employee was arrested by the Beiping police and tortured to force him to reveal the location of the steel plate for printing the stamps. This person, named Tumayeff, was originally a Georgian prince and has worked for the China Post Office for 25 years. He was arrested on the 23rd of this month within the Legation Quarter in Jiaomin Lane, Beiping. According to Li Qi, Tumayeff has a very high character and will never hand over the steel plate, which is stored in a certain foreign bank, no matter what. Li Qi also said that the reason why the Japanese were able to order the Beiping police to arrest and torture Tumayeff was entirely because he was a White Russian and did not enjoy consular jurisdiction. Li Qi is currently in Nanjing, requesting the British and American embassies to intervene and seek justice so that the Japanese will release him as soon as possible. Li Qi then gave a moving account of the maintenance of postal communications between Shanghai and the capital during the recent war. Even though the mail was being transported under constant bombing by Japanese aircraft, every effort was made to deliver it by rail, road, and waterway. He said that even if Shanghai were completely besieged by the Japanese army in the future, the mail would still find a way to be delivered. (Reuters dispatch, 28th, via Central News Agency)

Letter to the Citizens

Since August 13th, our national army, under the command of the highest authorities, has been fighting a bloody war to defend Greater Shanghai and the territorial sovereignty of the Republic of China. Two and a half months have passed. In these two and a half months, our front-line soldiers, with unprecedented bravery, fought against the enemy's elite mechanized forces of the army, navy, and air force, which has shocked and amazed the whole world, adding glory to our national history. Now, in order to shorten the battle lines and facilitate a protracted war, the national army has been moving and adjusting the lines on the eastern battlefield from the first line to the second line since October 26th. This is entirely due to strategic necessity. Although we have temporarily withdrawn from Jiangwan and Zhabei, the enemy has spent two and a half months and a huge amount of manpower and material resources, and as a result, they have only occupied a line of positions on the north bank of the Huangpu River that is less than 20 kilometers long. This has proved that our national army cannot be easily humiliated. We will never easily give up our territory. Our army has retreated to the second line, relying on more favorable terrain and pre-prepared defensive fortifications, deep trenches, and solid fortifications, and coordinating with the actions of the national army in North China to fight a protracted war to consume and destroy the aggressor's military power and strive for final victory. There is no doubt about this. In the process of this movement of positions, the enemy and traitors will inevitably spread rumors everywhere to confuse people and even advocate for peace negotiations. For this reason, various organizations in Shanghai are holding a joint meeting today to solemnly declare to the citizens of Greater Shanghai that resisting to the end and sacrificing to the end has become the established national policy of our government. We must support this national policy to the end. We will never allow the rumors and incitement of traitors or those who are born of defeat to shake the determination of the military and civilians on the front and rear to resist the war. The citizens of Greater Shanghai will not only not waver or slacken, but will also more resolutely and enthusiastically carry out the anti-enemy support work. We must sacrifice gloriously for the country and the nation like the soldiers fighting on the front line. We are determined to protect Greater Shanghai, because Greater Shanghai is the territory of the Republic of China and cannot be abandoned. Citizens of Greater Shanghai, get up quickly, support the government's national policy of resisting to the end, strengthen the unity between the government and the people, and between the people and the army. Everyone rise up, become the rear support for the soldiers on the front line, resolutely implement the economic boycott of Japan, severely punish traitors, help the army in its work, and demand that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference impose sanctions on Japan. These responsibilities fall on the shoulders of the citizens of Greater Shanghai. Citizens of Greater Shanghai, rise up, protect Greater Shanghai, protect the Republic of China, support the government, and resist to the end!

### Women's Circles in Shanghai Unite to Support Our Resistance Against Japan

Telegraphing the League of Nations to Request Upholding All International Conventions; Sympathizing with Wounded Soldiers and Refugees, Exerting Efforts to Donate Funds for Rescue and Care; Women's Groups Hosted Guests Yesterday

Various women's groups in this city, in order to request women of various countries to assert the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty, specially hosted leading women of various countries in this city at the International Hotel on the second floor yesterday afternoon at four o'clock. The details are as follows:

Guests Attending

The women from various countries who attended included Ms. Smith, representative of the American Chamber of Commerce, Mrs. Marshall, President of the British Chamber of Commerce, Mrs. Luson Pan, wife of the French Consul in Shanghai, Mrs. Sherman, wife of the Russian Consul, Mrs. Ansel, wife of the German Consul, Mrs. Wetner, Chairman of the British Women's Group, Mrs. Lunuo, representative of Hungary, Mrs. Anor, wife of the American Commercial Counselor, and Mrs. Merlot, etc., together with approximately 300 representatives from women's groups in this city, including Mrs. Kong, wife of Minister Kong, Mrs. Yu, wife of Mayor Yu, Tian Shujun, wife of Commander Yang, He Xiangning, Jin Guangmei, Qian Jianqiu, Zhu Su'e, Li Zemin, Wu Zao, etc.

Speech by the Chair

First, the Chair, Liu Wang Liming, explained the significance of hosting the leading women of various countries in Mandarin. Then, she delivered a speech in English, the gist of which was: ⑴ to report on the organization and work of the joint office, ⑵ to thank the friendly nations for their assistance, ⑶ to request women of various countries to assert the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty, to advocate fairness and justice, and to safeguard world peace. Next, Mrs. Kong, Soong Ai-ling, delivered a speech in English.

Mrs. Kong's Speech

On behalf of the Chinese women in Shanghai, I sincerely extend my welcome to our foreign friends. At a time when your governments advised you to return home, you remained here and shared the dangers of the war with us. Our emotion is self-evident as we gather together this afternoon. Our friendship in ordinary times has united us women, and this hardship has strengthened our bond. We have all witnessed Japan's acts of aggression in Shanghai. In this city and its suburbs, which have always enjoyed peace, the Japanese army has slaughtered lives and destroyed property. Everyone shares our compatriots' outrage at this cruel and inhumane behavior. We are grateful for your participation in rescue work in various fields, which has reduced the suffering of innocent civilians who have been harmed by artillery fire without a declaration of war. The echo of the cannons has not yet ceased, and every tremor reminds us of the increasing death, destruction, and devastation. Since ancient times, women have been considered the comforters of humanity. For example, when a child falls, any mother unconsciously picks up the child and kisses the bruised knee or head. This deep comfort can alleviate pain better than anything else. Indeed, compassion is the balm and the only comfort for people's hearts. But today, women must go further to ensure world peace. We must strive to uphold international justice and social justice. Only if we women all over the world unite to work for international justice can we end the worsening environment we face today. This is not a fantasy, but a practical common sense. Women, I hope you believe this simple truth: if we want peace, we must work on the ground. We must seek international justice according to our beliefs, and we must recognize that the foundation of lasting peace is built only on true international justice. To you, China is like a second home. In addition to moral support, you have given our compatriots much practical help, and I must express my gratitude. Then, Miss He Xiangning's daughter, Liao Mengxing, delivered a speech on behalf of her mother.

Resolution on Support

Subsequently, Mrs. Ansel, representative of the German Women's Association, Mrs. Lunuo, representative of Hungary, Ms. Smith, representative of the American Chamber of Commerce, Mrs. Sherman, wife of the Russian Consul, Mrs. Wetner, Chairman of the British Women's Association, and others successively expressed their opinions. The gist of their remarks was: ⑴ to express their deep sympathy for the fighting spirit of the Chinese people during the national crisis, ⑵ to express their willingness to assist in the rescue work, ⑶ to encourage Chinese women not to despair, to use education over a long period of time to keep the cruelty of war away from humanity forever, ⑷ to sympathize and donate funds. Finally, the American representative proposed that, in addition to the women present jointly telegraphing Ms. Dingman, President of the Women's Peace Association of the League of Nations, requesting that the dignity and integrity of the Nine-Power Treaty and all other treaties be maintained, the women attending would also telegraph individually to uphold fairness and justice and to safeguard world peace. This was unanimously approved. At about 7 o'clock, the tea party adjourned.

### Tongji University Resumes Classes After Relocating to Jinhua

(Jinhua Dispatch) National Tongji University has relocated to Jinhua and commenced the semester on the 20th of this month. All faculty and staff have arrived at the campus, and classes officially began on the 25th of this month. A memorial week for the Premier was held at 10:00 AM on the same day, attended by over six hundred faculty, staff and students. President Weng Zhilong, who had been receiving treatment in Hangzhou due to illness, made a special trip to Jinhua to attend despite his condition and gave a speech summarizing the university’s relocation process and plans for revival. He stated that after the Lugouqiao Incident, fearing the Japanese’s meticulous planning, the university managed to move important equipment to safe areas before the Battle of Shanghai could be avoided. At that time, in order to avoid causing social unrest, this could only be done secretly, and the difficulties involved were truly beyond the comprehension of others. After the “August 13th” Anti-Japanese War broke out, although a temporary campus site had been found, it was feared that this all-out war of resistance would not end in the short term, and Shanghai was the front line of the war. In order to maintain education continuously, it was necessary to choose a site for relocation. Moreover, more than two-thirds of the universities in the country were concentrated in Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin) and Shanghai, especially in Shanghai, which was a disproportionate development of education in our country that had long been criticized by those in the know. The authorities had long wanted to adjust this situation. Our university is a complete practical science university. After the "January 28th" Incident, I took over the presidency of the university and, learning from past mistakes, had a plan to move to the interior, but it had not been realized due to factual constraints. Therefore, the relocation of our university from Shanghai was the realization of a consistent plan. As for the new site of our university, the reason for choosing Jinhua was also after detailed consideration. The new site of our university must ⑴ be convenient for transportation, ⑵ have a suitable environment, and ⑶ be not easily threatened by the enemy. Jinhua has convenient land and water transportation, and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway runs through the county. In military terms, it has no importance, and the enemy aircraft's threat is only to destroy transportation. The new site of our university is far from the railway line. In terms of safety, during the War of Resistance, enemy aircraft are rampant everywhere, except for remote provinces such as Sichuan. How can there be any guaranteed safety? How can we bear to put our personal safety above maintaining continuous education? Moreover, Jinhua has beautiful scenery with mountains and rivers, and a strong literary tradition. From the perspective of human and geographical geography, the environment is extremely suitable. Except for Hangzhou, there are no universities in the interior of Zhejiang Province. The relocation of our university to Jinhua is also extremely necessary for the adjustment of university education. This relocation was approved by the authorities and assisted by the Beijing-Shanghai and Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureaus and the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Jinhua local administrative organs. The relocation was completed in four days without any loss, which is very difficult. Fortunately, all the faculty and staff have arrived at the campus, and the German professors have also telegraphed the school, and will come together in a few days. As for the university's current plans, ⑴ temporary school buildings will be built soon, with land purchased with donations from the faculty and staff; ⑵ after relocating to the interior, we will encourage the spirit of research among the faculty and students and foster a good and simple academic style to establish a new foundation for education. The frivolous and extravagant habits acquired in Shanghai must be eradicated and not allowed to remain, so that we can study and work hard in a practical way; ⑶ in order to meet the needs of the long-term war of resistance, we will strive to supplement specialized technical personnel. The speech was very long, and the ceremony ended at about 12 o'clock.

### Shen Junru and Six Others Will Go to Nanjing Together Within Days

To Contribute Important Opinions; To Report on the General Situation of the Rear Area

Shen Junru, Wang Zao Shi, Sha Qianli, Zou Taofen, Shi Liang, and four others, in view of the fact that the Shanghai war has entered a new stage and the situation of the War of Resistance is developing, in order to contribute important opinions for the government to adopt, have decided to depart together for Nanjing within the next few days to meet with the central authorities and make statements. At the same time, they will give a detailed report on the general situation of the resistance line in the rear area of Shanghai and the work done in the past.

### Anti-Japanese Postcards Released

The Anti-Japanese Postcard Society at No. 80 Hualong Road in this city has released a new type of anti-Japanese postcard, with designs by famous painters and texts by famous writers. There are six types in total: ⑴ to send to generals and brave soldiers, ⑵ to give to wounded soldiers, ⑶ to solicit donations for national salvation bonds, ⑷ to write to relatives and friends, etc. During this period of the War of Resistance, it is extremely sufficient to inspire patriotic enthusiasm. It is said that each set of six cards sells for six cents, and sending a letter with sufficient return postage (three cents) will ensure delivery.

Commentary

### The Model of Patriotic Soldiers

— Yi

When our army in Zhabei withdrew the day before yesterday, more than 800 loyal and brave soldiers led by Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan and Battalion Commander Yang Ruifu of the 88th Division were ordered to hold key points to cover the transfer of the main force. After the mission was completed, they could have calmly withdrawn with the main force, but everyone was determined to sacrifice for the country. They waited for the enemy to occupy Zhabei and continued to resist. Finally, they were trapped in the Sihang Warehouse and fought with the pursuing enemy, killing as many as sixty or seventy enemies with hand grenades and machine guns. The enemy army is still besieging them. According to the statement of these soldiers, although they are in a state of isolation and helplessness, they are determined to fight the enemy to the death for a week. This spirit of regarding death as home has not only been witnessed by many Chinese and foreigners in the concession, but also spread abroad. It is as sensational to the world as the story of the Spanish soldiers holding the Alcázar fortress to the death.

These eight hundred soldiers, displaying the virtues of fortitude, agility, and bravery, are the model of our countless patriotic soldiers. This makes everyone believe that the Chinese army will never be defeated by the enemy even in the most difficult circumstances. The recent abandonment of Zhabei is obviously far from being a defeat.

Let us allow the enemy to boast to the world that the Imperial Army has occupied such and such places. In the suburbs of Beiping, our thousands of advancing teams are still active, making the enemy feel a great threat. The eight hundred soldiers in the Sihang Warehouse are also containing a considerable number of enemy troops in Zhabei. In the past two days alone, they have made the enemy taste no small bitterness. We can assert that in any occupied territory, the enemy will not be able to sleep peacefully for a day.

### Nine-Power Treaty Conference Invites Russia and Germany to Participate

Japan's Refusal to Attend Does Not Impede the Conference's Progress; The United States' Attitude Is Not Expected to Change

⊙Brussels The Belgian government, having consulted with the signatory nations of the Nine-Power Treaty who have agreed to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, has formally invited Germany and the Soviet Union to send representatives to participate. The letters of invitation have been sent out today. (Central News Agency, Havas, 28th)

⊙Brussels According to sources, the postponement of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will not delay the conference's progress. According to the original plan, the first meeting, scheduled for October 30, will be merely a formality to decide on sending invitations to Germany and the Soviet Union. Afterwards, the conference will adjourn for three days to await replies from Russia and Germany. It is expected that representatives from Germany and the Soviet Union will be able to attend the official opening of the conference on November 3. Japan's refusal to participate was expected and did not cause any real disappointment. According to general opinion, if Italy, Germany, and Russia do not defend Japan or hinder the proceedings, Japan's absence will allow the conference to proceed more quickly with its work. As for the League of Nations' Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese issue, which was originally scheduled to meet on November 5, it has now been postponed indefinitely and will be convened after the completion of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 28th)

[Paris] After arriving here today, the head of the American delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Davis, immediately scheduled a meeting with the American Ambassador to France, Bullitt. It is believed that the two will discuss the Far East issue. (28th, National Telegram)

### The US Still Holds Its Established Position

[Washington] Although the State Department has not commented on Japan's refusal to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, observers believe that the United States' attitude will not change and that it will continue to cooperate with other related countries. The United States will also oppose any delays in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in the future. As for Japan's refusal to participate in the conference, it is probably related to the victory of the Japanese army in Shanghai yesterday. In the past, whenever the country made military progress after invading northeastern China, it would become more assertive in its diplomatic attitude. This is consistent with the past. In addition, Secretary of State Hull also declined to express his opinion, saying only that the Japanese government's reply to the Belgian government had not yet been fully received here. (Central News Agency, Havas, 27th)

[Washington] It is generally believed that President Roosevelt's announced goal of using the Nine-Power Conference to mediate the Sino-Japanese conflict, now that Japan has refused to participate in the conference, even if it is not impossible, is in an extremely difficult position. American isolationists originally did not approve of intervening in foreign affairs, but after hearing President Roosevelt's statement that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference was convened for the purpose of reconciliation, they no longer insisted on their opposition. Now that the situation has changed, and the United States may be drawn into the vortex and adopt a threatening plan, isolationists may revive their high-sounding rhetoric of rejecting foreign affairs. This is also what the US President is worried about. In fact, the question of what steps to take other than mediation has not been considered. It is expected that a peaceful condemnation, such as recalling ambassadors, will be proposed in the future. However, judging from the phenomena, the government has not bound the US delegation's hands with prior consideration of this policy. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 28th)

### Eden Will Attend in Person

[London] Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Foreign Secretary Eden announced in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon that he would personally lead the delegation to attend. The other representatives are Overseas Dominion Minister Malcolm MacDonald and Foreign Office Assistant Sir Cadogan (former ambassador to China). (Central News Agency, Havas, 28th)

[London] Members of the British Parliament recently stated that the British government hopes that this conference will achieve success within the scope specified in Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech on October 21. (Note: The Prime Minister's speech stated that Britain's participation in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference was aimed at seeking peace, not expanding the war. The immediate task is to consider what joint action can be taken to achieve a peaceful solution.) In addition, the British government is eager to understand the US government's views and hopes that the United States will be able to launch some initiatives at the conference when the opportunity arises. Also, if Foreign Secretary Eden leaves Brussels, Malcolm MacDonald will serve as acting chief representative. This move of appointing MacDonald as a representative is highly valued by political figures, as all British dominions have representatives attending the conference, and MacDonald's participation in the conference as Minister of the Dominions will enable him to get along well with the representatives of the Dominions.

### Researching a Replacement for the Washington Treaty

[Paris] According to news from here today, as the opening date of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference approaches, major countries are now engaged in studying a way to completely replace the Washington Treaties. Since Japan seized the four northeastern provinces, the system of the Washington Treaties has been completely destroyed by Japan. Furthermore, even if the Sino-Japanese dispute is resolved, the international relations of East Asia will inevitably be placed on a new treaty basis. (28th, National Telegram)

### Japan's Reply Is Far-Fetched and Absurd

Ignoring the Will of Others and Persisting in Its Own Way; Opposing Interference by the Powers

[Tokyo] The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs today formally rejected the Belgian government's invitation to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The wording is far-fetched and absurd, and only a violent Japan could say such things. The gist is that this conference was initiated by the League of Nations, which has spiritually supported China, so it is inconvenient for Japan to participate. It also stated that Japan's actions in China were purely for self-defense and cannot be restricted by the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Furthermore, the League of Nations has never had a good impression of Japan, so the North One Conference will not be able to conduct a fair discussion of Japan's position. Finally, the powers' intervention in Far Eastern affairs will only make the Far Eastern problem more difficult to solve. In short, its tone still regards itself as the master of East Asia.

Britain Expresses Regret

⊙London It is regrettable here that Japan has refused to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, as this move will make mediation more difficult. It is understood that other countries may be asked to mediate at that time and notify Tokyo of the conference's situation, and Germany would be the most suitable country to mediate. (28th, National Telegram)

French Newspapers Criticize

⊙Paris Regarding Japan's refusal to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, French newspapers of both the left and right have unanimously criticized it. The Radical Socialist Party's newspaper stated, "The task of this conference is to work hard to mediate in order to end the war between China and Japan. If the Japanese government were to participate, wouldn't that be a wise move? It is a pity that the country's experienced and prudent politicians have been unable to do anything because of military interference. Japan's attack on China was originally an unjust act. If China were not short of the ordinary weapons needed for self-defense, then the tomb of the Japanese Empire would undoubtedly be dug in Chinese territory. According to a certain Japanese politician in a private letter, if China continues to resist, then the time when the war ends may also be the time when Japan establishes a republic, which is not necessarily impossible." The right-wing Le Petit Journal stated, "The Japanese military believes that refusing to participate in the conference has only advantages and no disadvantages. It can be seen that the country is winning militarily and is afraid that someone will stop it, so it persists in its own way. The self-indulgent Japanese imperialism will inevitably regret it." The right-wing Le Temps stated, "Although Japan has stated that it has no territorial ambitions for China, this statement has lost its effect due to the large scope of its military operations in China. Now that the country has refused to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, it has confirmed the general public's concerns about Japan's ambitions. As for today's countermeasures, it is not appropriate to implement them, and all that can be hoped for is mediation." (Central News Agency, Havas, 28th)

### British Cabinet Discusses the Far East Situation

The Content Has Not Been Leaked to the Outside; Still Trying to Accommodate Japan?

[London] The British Cabinet meeting today discussed the Far East situation for a long time. It met for two and a half hours in the morning and one and a half hours in the afternoon, discussing for a total of four hours, but the content has not been leaked to the outside. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 27th)

[London] At the Cabinet meeting yesterday, the issue of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference was discussed. Observers believe that Britain will oppose any sanctions. Although the Japanese government has refused to participate in this conference, the related countries can still carry out constructive work, in other words, namely ⑴ if China and Japan sign an agreement to end the war in the future, the related countries can put pressure on Japan to reduce the demands it may make, ⑵ the related countries can exchange information on the protection of interests in China, and ⑶ the related countries can consult on methods of cooperation to ensure the safety of their territories adjacent to the war zone.

### The Enemy Blockades Our Country's Coastline

The Impact on Maritime Trade Is Minimal

[San Francisco] According to statistics released today by the Pacific Council, Japan's current blockade of the Chinese coast has had very little impact on China's maritime trade. For the past five years, Chinese ships have accounted for only 25 to 30 percent of all maritime transport, and have no bearing on the war, as the arms and equipment imported by China have always been transported by foreign ships. If calculated by the tonnage of seaborne goods, Britain ranked first last year, reaching 41 million tons, accounting for more than 41 percent. Now, Japan should not be allowed to obstruct Britain's trade with China. Japan ranks third, after Chinese ships, accounting for about 15 and a half percent. This number has increased by 5 percent compared to before the January 28th Incident. The United States has always had very little, only 1 percent. In short, since Japan cannot infringe on the freedom of other countries' ships, the so-called blockade is only a facade. (27th, National Telegram)

[San Francisco] Today, a crowd of 600 people, including 200 Chinese, gathered at the wharf of the Japanese Postal Ship Company here to demonstrate for an hour and a half, shouting "Boycott Japanese goods" and "Don't forget the massacre in Shanghai." At that time, a Japanese postal ship happened to be at the shore, and two Japanese disseminators were surrounded by the crowd. Four porters also expressed their indignation at Japan's actions in China and went on strike for 15 minutes to show their protest. The crowd cheered and applauded. Afterwards, the crowd tried to break through the defense line set up by the police on the wharf, resulting in four white people and two Chinese being arrested by the police.

### Japan's Invasion War Against China: A Crisis Looms

Extreme Consumption of Resources, Declining International Status – No Spare Strength for Foreign Expansion Within Twenty Years – Observations of an American Military Expert

[Washington] Military and diplomatic experts here observed today that Japan's war in China, regardless of victory or defeat or withdrawal from Chinese territory, will render Japan incapable of coveting the Philippines for twenty years. In this war, Japan's financial and human resources will be extremely depleted, leaving it with no spare strength for further development elsewhere. Even if Japan were to achieve a pyrrhic victory in this war and control a vast territory in North China, the funds required to develop this vast land would plunge Japan into a state of exhaustion. Even with the strength to develop it, it would take a considerable number of years to reap any benefits. However, if victory in this war belongs to China, then Japan will not only "lose face greatly" and lose its status as a first-class power, but will also trigger a major revolution at home, plunging it into prolonged internal turmoil and leaving it with no spare strength for foreign expansion. Furthermore, Soviet Russia is eyeing Japan from the side, with the possibility of conflict at any time. Therefore, Japan cannot exhaust its strength in the war against China, lest it creates future troubles. Finally, the United States has not completely abandoned the Philippines, so Japan certainly would not dare to offend all parties at the same time, thereby increasing the danger to its position. Therefore, in the next twenty years, Japan will have no spare strength to covet the Philippines. (National Telegram, 27th)

### If China Can Sustain Resistance

It Will Inevitably Spur Revolution in Japan – Observations of a French Political Commentator

### Italian Prime Minister's Speech Again Advocates Peace Slogans

Supports Germany's Colonial Demands, Expresses Continued Anti-Communist Warfare

[Rome] Italian Prime Minister Mussolini addressed 100,000 people in Mussolini Square today, stating that the slogan for the sixteenth Fascist year, beginning today, is peace. Mussolini stated that the word "peace" has been misused by so-called democratic countries, but only when we use it does it have a profound and humane meaning, because we have gone to war and are preparing for major wars. Mussolini later stated that the result of the past fifteen years has been the revival of the Roman Empire, and it has not been aided by other countries. Mussolini also said, "The colonial clauses in the peace treaty must be revised, because a great people like Germany should have a corresponding position in the world." When Mussolini made this statement, he did not specify which colonial clauses he was referring to. After Mussolini finished speaking, he introduced Hitler's representative, Hess, to the crowd, who greeted him with enthusiastic cheers. Later, Mussolini mentioned his visit to Germany, saying that the friendship between Germany and Italy is now increasingly solid, and that communism must be driven out of Europe. (Central News Agency, Reuters Telegram, 28th)

[London] Regarding the Italian Prime Minister's speech today, political figures commented that Italy's desire to eliminate communism in Europe while maintaining peace is contradictory. It is difficult for the British to understand how Italy intends to eliminate communism without resorting to war. As for Mussolini's support for Germany's colonial demands, political figures believe that Britain is prepared to consider the restoration of German colonies, but only on the condition that German leader Hitler expresses his desire for peace.

Commentary

### Scorched Earth Warfare and the Determination to Sacrifice

— Zheng Zhenduo

The northern sky is entirely filled with gray and dark black columns of smoke. Columns of smoke winding for several miles, with no gaps in between.

Zhabei, woven by Asuras! A hell on earth.

The roaring firelight shines through the smoke, dyeing the sky and earth red.

The incomparably brave soldiers are still fighting to the death, refusing to retreat!

In the red light, one can see half a crumbling wall, broken pillars with missing roofs.

Thick smoke rolls with red tongues of fire, and outside the thick smoke are pale red flames.

From morning to night, the winding flames burn, destroying everything.

Not a single lament can be heard, not a single tear can be seen.

Anger has scorched all the tears dry! There is nothing to miss, nothing to lament! Only a stronger heart to resist the enemy, a more disciplined will to resist the enemy!

The determination to sacrifice, the sacrifice of determination!

It turns out that we started the full-scale war of resistance with the determination to "resist to the end, sacrifice to the end."

The roaring firelight and the vigorous smoke symbolize the vigor and courage of the people of Shanghai in their determination to resist the enemy.

Zhabei is now surrounded and destroyed by flames! But Zhabei will never be destroyed! Like a phoenix, it will be reborn from the ashes; it will be reborn with more magnificent feathers and soar into the sky.

The destruction of Zhabei in "January 28th" only strengthened the will of the people of Shanghai to resist the enemy. Now, the flames of "October 27th" will further ignite their firm determination to sacrifice.

Never seek survival at the expense of integrity! Only jade shattered!

The soldiers at the front have endured concentrated bombing by more than a hundred enemy planes, and concentrated attacks by countless long-range naval and land artillery pieces, with almost no five-foot radius of soil left unturned. They have held on for more than seventy days. Their courage, their spirit of fearlessness, will forever be a symbol of the rebirth of the national soul, and will forever be an immortal feat that will startle heaven and earth and move ghosts and gods.

And the sacrifice of the people of Shanghai is like molten iron that matches it, and solidifies into the glory of our nation.

Never leave a single tile, a single small house that can shelter from the wind and rain, for the enemy to occupy!

Every step they take forward, the land they step on is scorched earth!

More than seventy days of hard fighting, the loss of more than 60,000 soldiers, the squandering of countless bombs and shells, and only a piece of scorched earth in Zhabei were exchanged. This will proclaim to them: What kind of firm determination and courage the Chinese nation has in its scorched earth resistance!

We may retreat step by step; but what we leave them is all scorched earth. This scorched earth is the bomb they swallow, the lead bullet shot into their chest.

Like a lion hunting a rabbit, when we turn around, we will see the enemy retreating in a panic! The bomb they swallowed will surely explode!

We, the army and the people, are united to defend our Shanghai! We will always hold on to the determination to fight a scorched earth war! Zhabei has become a piece of scorched earth and has been abandoned, but Shanghai must be defended! Defend it until it becomes a piece of scorched earth!

If they dare to take a step forward, that step must cost them 60,000 to 70,000 people, more than seventy to a hundred days of hard fighting, and the squandering of countless bombs and shells, and the land they step on is a piece of scorched earth!

What's more, blocking them is the famous "Eastern Maginot Line"!

The people of Shanghai have no sorrow, no tears, only more determined courage and will to welcome this inevitable scorched earth war!

Like a lion hunting a rabbit, when we turn around, we will see the enemy retreating in a panic!

### Inhuman Enemy Strafes Our Refugees

50,000 Refugees Gather in West Shanghai, With No Food or Drink, Urgent Relief Needed

The number of refugees in the Western District who have fled into the Concession from Route Tenant de Villiers is less than in previous days. The Concession has dispatched ambulances to stop there. Those who have been injured by stray bullets and women and children are escorted by the vehicles. Those who are able to walk are briefly questioned by the stationed troops and then released. According to eyewitnesses, the enemy army opened machine guns and strafed the refugees several times when about 10,000 to 20,000 refugees from Zhabei attempted to enter Route Tenant de Villiers from the north bank of the Suzhou Creek along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway bridge. Many women and children were killed. The railway bridge was littered with corpses, a horrific sight. The Public Concession authorities opened the iron gates several times, allowing the refugees to enter the Concession successively.

It is also reported that after our army moved west for strategic reasons and withdrew the garrison from Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Miaohang, the people along the north bank of the Suzhou Creek lost their reliance and fled south one after another. Since the blocking of Yujiazhai Bridge, traffic has been cut off invisibly, and the refugees are even more at a loss, especially the farmers in the Pengpu area. From the evening of the 27th to noon today, the number of refugees gathered on Zhongshan Road and near Xujiahui in West Shanghai has reached more than 50,000, who have been without food or drink for 20 hours and are in urgent need of relief. At the same time, the various reception centers set up by the Emergency Period Refugee Relief Branch are also full. It is hoped that all great philanthropists will quickly donate funds for relief. The association will welcome those who allocate funds to set up additional reception centers. Just report the location, the number of people to be accommodated, and the budget. The North China Daily News reported that a certain foreigner took a film camera to inspect the area around Jessfield Park yesterday morning. He told the representative of the North China Daily News that the scenes he saw in the morning were too many for his film to capture. At least 20 Japanese planes were in the sky at that time, diving and bombing Zhongshan Road on both sides of Jessfield Road from time to time. At one point, the planes were very close to the British barracks, and the surrounding residents, apparently panicked by the destruction of the Zhongshan Road bridge, fled into the Concession in groups from early morning. Several hundred people also advanced along Route Tenant de Villiers towards the British guard post near the railway. When he arrived there, he watched from a convenient location as Japanese planes began bombing the vehicles near the station and the various cotton mills. The Japanese planes were all silver-colored single-wing planes. He took many pictures. Then he was shocked because three planes actually opened machine guns and fired at the fleeing refugees. He saw the planes very clearly. One was a seaplane, like the ones carried by the Izumo, and the other 200 were small fighter planes. They dived repeatedly, and the refugees scattered and fled in panic. He estimated that at least 200 people were killed or injured. Probably there were many more elsewhere. Some were still lying there. He saw six ambulances, fully loaded with the wounded, leaving. Another large group of refugees, with varying degrees of injuries, poured into the Concession, or were helped to safety by others. The situation at that time was very chaotic. Not only were a large number of refugees trying to enter the Concession, but many were also trying to leave the Concession, heading towards the Chinese military lines. Those who wanted to enter the Concession were allowed to pass, but those who wanted to leave were stopped. This happened between 10:00 am and noon. Just after 3:00 pm yesterday, a team of British officers and foreign civilians was shot at by machine guns from the north of the Suzhou Creek near the Jessfield Railway Bridge, and the crowd fled. Several Chinese refugees in the north of the Suzhou Creek were also shot in the back by machine guns. Yesterday evening, dozens of people, looking like farmers, fled into the Concession from the Hongqiao area. Last night, the Salvation Army claimed that about 5,000 refugees from the Hongqiao area had fled into the Concession yesterday afternoon. They did not bring any food, and very few clothes. They all passed through the British defense line and were led by Chinese and foreign staff of the Salvation Army into Route Tenant de Villiers. According to Mr. Morris, a British officer of the association, the association will provide at least one hot meal before 6:30 pm, and prepare a large amount of rice to be sent to Route Tenant de Villiers to feed the refugees spending the night there. It is expected that they will be moved to refugee shelters today.

### Battlefield Rescue Team Relocates to the Interior

The Concession is Not a True Rear Area, Orders Rescue Workers to Rescue With the Army

Yu Hongxun, the captain of the Chinese Battlefield Rescue Team, believes that because Dachang has fallen, the enemy army has occupied Zhabei, and the Concession is not a true rear area, it is very inconvenient to travel long distances for rescue work. Therefore, yesterday, he relocated the first and second brigades of the team to the interior to work, and assigned the team's rescue personnel to various divisions, brigades, and regiments to rescue with the army to facilitate the work.

### All Sectors Benefiting Wounded Soldiers Generously Donate Large Sums of Money

Yu and Qian Each Donate 3,000, New Pharmaceutical Industry Donates 5,000

Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a prominent businessman in the city, is usually enthusiastic about social welfare, which is admired by both Chinese and foreigners. Since the Shanghai War, Mr. Yu has provided various assistance in the rescue of wounded soldiers and the relief of refugees, which has benefited many people. The Shanghai Rescue Committee specifically sent a letter to Mr. Yu the other day, inviting him to serve as the honorary chairman of the committee, so that his leadership could be obtained to strengthen the rescue force, and he has gladly agreed. Mr. Yu has decided to donate all of the more than 40,000 yuan given by all sectors during his 70th birthday last year, which was intended to be used as the preparatory fund for the Yu Qiaqing Hospital, to the Shanghai Rescue Committee to cover the expenses of rescuing wounded soldiers. In addition to donating 1,000 yuan himself, Mr. Yu also raised 1,000 yuan from the Sanbei Company, 500 yuan each from Madam Wang Pan and Xu Guisheng, totaling 3,000 yuan, which was handed over to the Shanghai Rescue Committee yesterday, designated for the bread expenses of the wounded soldier station. Qian Xinzhimin, the president of Fudan University, also generously donated 3,000 yuan yesterday and sent it to the committee for constitutional use. The generosity of Mr. Yu and Mr. Qian in benefiting wounded soldiers and their enthusiasm for national affairs can be used as an example.

The Shanghai Rescue Committee sent a letter to the National New Pharmaceutical Industry Association Federation, the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, and the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Association yesterday, stating that it had previously requested various representative groups and institutions to actively donate 100,000 yuan for monthly expenses, and is now grateful to the associations for generously donating 5,000 yuan. In addition to entrusting Dr. Yu Songjun to issue a formal receipt, a brief letter is used to express gratitude. In addition, the new pharmaceutical industry in the city has raised 5,000 yuan to comfort the soldiers in North China, which has also been fully paid by various industries.

### Firefighting Work in the Flames of Zhabei

The Fire Was Not Completely Extinguished Until Yesterday Morning, An Emergency Station Was Set Up in the Western District

Yesterday (the 27th), the firefighters of the Public Works Department were very busy. There were several fires north of the New Garbage Bridge and the boundary of the Concession. Firefighters rushed to protect and rescue them, and they have not been able to stop the fires until this morning (the 28th). The association has set up an emergency station in the Western District, and dispatched vehicles to be stationed there, so that vehicles can be dispatched as soon as they are called. Yesterday, there were 70 people injured by stray bullets, etc. The station dispatched vehicles to rescue them. Those with minor injuries were bandaged separately, and those with serious injuries were sent to Shi Hospital. There were fires in Tangshan Road, Weituoma Road, and Qiwupu Road in the Eastern District. Part of the China East Tobacco Company was destroyed, and several civilian houses were turned into rubble.

### Strictly Prohibit Unauthorized Increase in Rice Prices

If Rice Stores Automatically Increase Prices, Report It to the Regulatory Committee for Severe Punishment

The Municipal Food Regulation Committee believes that the city's rice reserves are sufficient to meet the needs of the people, and the highest price of white japonica rice is still 13.6 yuan per dan, and the secondary price is reduced accordingly. However, it is reported that some rice stores only care about private interests. On the day that our army voluntarily withdrew from the Zhabei Jiangwan Miaohang defense line, the rice price was increased to more than 14 yuan per dan without authorization. This kind of behavior is not only disturbing the market price, but its intention is no different from being a traitor. In addition to formally announcing that it is strictly forbidden for rice sellers not to comply with the prescribed market price, if citizens encounter rice stores automatically increasing prices, they can immediately report it to the Pudong Fellow Association Office of the Committee on Foch Road, and they can request the competent authority to severely punish them, in order to warn others against following their example.

### Chonghai and Cixi Fellow Associations Send Refugees Back to Their Hometowns

Chonghai Special Ship Sets Sail Tomorrow Morning, Cixi Fellow Townspeople Register Immediately

The first batch of ships that set off on the 25th have returned to Shanghai. The office has now decided to gather at the Tonghai Inn at Guanhai Bridge, Limalu, Nanshi tomorrow morning and set sail. Those who want to return can quickly register.

Due to the recent inconvenience in transportation, many Cixi fellow villagers living in Shanghai have requested the Cixi Shanghai Fellow Association to send them back to their hometowns. Now, the association has found a way to hire a large car for the purpose of rescuing poor fellow villagers, and will make the last trip from Shanghai to Hangzhou.

The Shanghai Municipal Government Affiliated Bureaus announced to the officials staying in Shanghai that they will receive living expenses, according to the special order No. 1787 of the Municipal Government, which is about the method of tightening the payment of salaries to public officials in various bureaus of the government.

### Christian Federation Continues 10,000 Vest Movement

The cotton vests previously made by the Shanghai Christian Federation have all been distributed to the soldiers on the front line, which is very popular. However, it is felt that there are too many people and too few clothes, and there is an urgent need for another 10,000 pieces. According to the reporter's observation, the fabric used this time is strong and durable, and the cotton used inside is the best quality white cotton, in order to be practical. The cost of materials and labor for each piece is 6 dimes and 5 cents in silver. The association is willing to serve others with this quality of goods. If donations are made by all sectors, the association can be entrusted to handle the purchasing of materials, tailoring, or purchasing materials, regardless of the amount. The association will do its best to provide services. Contact points: Miss Wei and Miss Ji, Room 210, Second Floor, Southern Part of Moore Memorial Church, Yu Qiaqing Road.

### Medical Community Cables Jiao Chen and Others, Requesting the Establishment of a Rescue Hospital

Since a National Hospital Cannot Be Built, It is Better to Run a Wounded Soldiers' Hospital

The Shanghai Chinese Medical Community Save-the-Nation Association recently telegraphed the Nanjing Central National Medical Museum, suggesting the organization of a wounded soldiers' hospital. The text reads, "Director Jiao Yitang and Chairman Chen Li of the Central National Medical Museum: Since the brutal Japanese have invaded us, the survival of the nation depends on one. All Chinese should rise up and jointly shoulder the responsibility of saving the nation and ensuring its survival. Our Chinese medical community has always been committed to maintaining the happiness of the people, and it is our inescapable duty to save them from danger. Since its establishment, the association has been engaged in various save-the-nation activities, and has never slackened. The most urgent thing to do at present is to establish a rescue hospital, which is sufficient to fulfill the duties of our community. The association will do its best to promote the financial and physical support of colleagues in the Shanghai medical community. However, this matter is of great importance and requires huge expenses, which cannot be achieved immediately. We intend to request the Museum to allocate the more than 100,000 yuan of funds raised for the National Hospital to the needs of the rescue hospital. Since the National Hospital cannot be built at present, it is better to run a rescue hospital to treat wounded soldiers and disaster victims, which is of great significance to saving the country and saving the people. We sincerely hope that you will adopt and handle it. At the same time, Xu Kaisheng, Xinru, and Jin Jian of the medical community will also make the same suggestions to Chen Jiao and others in their personal capacity."

### Ten Days of Bloody Battles at Chenjiahang (Part Two)

— Cheng

That day, the enemy had already recognized the might of our artillery. To survive, they launched a sneak attack on our Dunwu Temple position with five or six hundred soldiers at dusk. Our Commander × directed from the rear, turning the tables on them. He deliberately left a corner of the position open, allowing them to break in. When he personally saw more than a hundred of them advancing hesitantly, Commander × immediately ordered Li Battalion from the reserve force to encircle them. The enemy realized that we were planning to annihilate them, but by then, they were almost completely wiped out by our gunfire from all directions. In the end, only a dozen or so escaped. A large pile of Rising Sun flags and their murder weapons were left behind. The most regrettable part of this battle was that after about half of the enemy had entered the position, our loyal and valiant Battalion Commander Cai, personally leading a company, went to cut off the enemy's retreat. He engaged the enemy officers in close combat with pistols and broadswords, and unfortunately died in battle. Our commander-in-chief has lost another capable general. The division commander, brigade commander, and regimental commander were all deeply saddened. However, he brought glory to the entire nation, and we are honored for him.

Because the enemy suffered setbacks attacking Dunwu Temple and Qiaotingzhai, they shifted their focus to Chenjiahang. Except for a brief crisis at Dunwu Temple on the 12th, from the 13th to the 16th, the enemy launched four or five attacks daily on Chenjiahang, using smoke screens and artillery cover, with a large force. Because Chenjiahang was a key point in our army's defense, we had previously deployed sufficient troops here. The generals defending Chenjiahang were Vice Brigade Commander × and Commanders ×× of two regiments. These three generals were all experienced in combat and had repeatedly earned merits in previous battles. Therefore, although the enemy launched fierce attacks with great force, we were absolutely confident in holding the position. Every time the enemy's attack became urgent, these three generals personally led machine guns to block the enemy in critical areas. Their bravery in battle and their skillful command were admired even by the enemy. At noon on the 15th, the enemy broke through the northeastern corner of the Chenjiahang position. We didn't pay attention to it at the time. When the enemy was sleeping soundly at midnight, our division commander mobilized a dozen mortars and selected the most elite battalion for a counterattack. This battalion commander, surnamed Zhang, was also from Shandong and was extremely brave in battle. After our dozen mortars fired more than two hundred shells together, the infantry, led by Battalion Commander Zhang, charged forward. Most of the two hundred enemies occupying the small bamboo garden were killed by the shells, and the rest died under our bayonets and hand grenades. The enemy counterattacked again that night, but we repelled them again.

On the 16th, there was another full day of bloody battle. At noon, the enemy gathered more than a hundred heavy artillery pieces, first using smoke screens to obscure our vision, and then the artillery fired in unison. The position defended by Battalion Commander Zhang was destroyed by the enemy's artillery, followed by a large-scale attack on us. Battalion Commander Zhang led his troops to resist desperately, killing more than a hundred enemies. The enemy, under the pressure of our infantry and artillery fire, retreated in disorder. Battalion Commander Zhang, seeing an opportunity, immediately left the trenches to pursue, but was shot in a vital spot by the enemy and seriously wounded. He was taken to the hospital in the evening and unfortunately died due to his injuries.

After spending seven days, using up tens of thousands of shells, and losing more than five thousand men, the enemy failed to break through our position. On the night of the 16th, they used poison gas against our troops. Dozens of soldiers defending the northeast positions of Chenjiahang were poisoned. After we discovered it, we immediately used first aid to save them. Only a few died. The enemy's inhumanity should be condemned by the whole world. On this day, when the battle was most critical, our division commander personally went to the front line to direct and supervise the battle. He was prepared to coexist with the Chenjiahang position and the loyal officers and soldiers. This was spread throughout the entire battle line, and the officers and soldiers were all inspired.

On the 17th, we handed over the defense to friendly forces. The position was the same when we handed it over as when we took it over. In total, we killed more than three thousand enemies and captured many weapons. What was most satisfying was that, when the change of guard was about to take place, a brother from Regiment × saw three enemy soldiers carrying a light machine gun towards our position. This brother went around from the side and threw two hand grenades when the enemy was close. All three enemy soldiers were killed, and he carried the enemy's machine gun back by himself. He has been promoted to sergeant, and the division commander rewarded him with forty yuan. Such a soldier with both intelligence and courage is truly rare.

Also, on the morning of the 12th, a small squad of our soldiers risked their lives to charge into the enemy's position, where there were two enemy anti-aircraft machine guns, aiming at our planes. Our soldiers bravely stepped forward and threw hand grenades. As the sparks flew, enemy corpses lay scattered, and two anti-aircraft machine guns were in our hands. Unfortunately, those two guns were too heavy for us to move. Later, we gathered hand grenades and blew up the two guns.

As we were talking, several soldiers came to pick him up on a stretcher. So I urged him to get on the stretcher and go back to the rear for treatment, and wished him a speedy recovery. He told me that he was very willing to regain his health immediately and return to the front line to kill enemies. After we parted, I took a ride on a certain army's truck back to Shanghai. As I was writing this manuscript, the image of this wounded young officer still lingered in my mind.

According to the person in charge of the committee, they plan to raise 10 million yuan in national currency to subsidize various charities to aid wounded soldiers and refugees in the next six months. In addition to raising funds domestically, they have telegraphed friendly countries and overseas Chinese charities, requesting assistance.

Similar telegrams have also been sent to the embassies in Britain, France, and other countries. It is also reported that they plan to invite famous actors to perform plays to raise funds. Dr. Mei Lanfang has agreed. Once the preparations are complete, the program will be announced and performances will be scheduled.

### Tea Exports Increase Rather Than Decrease

China's Production Increases; Great Demand in Britain

Since the start of the full-scale war of resistance, import and export trade has been affected to some extent. However, the export of China's native products has not been hindered. Taking tea as an example, the tea produced in Fujian, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu provinces in China has continued to increase rather than decrease. It is reported that this year's tea production, under the overall planning of the China Tea Company, will not decrease. Britain, with weakened production in Ceylon, is seeking more tea from China.

A rental fee will be offered. Benevolent individuals who are willing to offer their property are requested to contact the Nursing Home of the Poor Children's School on Jiaozhou Road.

### Fire in Jinliyuan Wharf No. 4 Warehouse Due to Carelessness

Lack of Water for Firefighting Causes Devastation; Most Goods in the Warehouse Burned

At Jinliyuan Wharf No. 4, Sixteen Pupu, Nanshi, the lower floor is the customs inspection room of the Jianghai Customs, and the upper floor is rented to British merchants Taikoo and Jardine Matheson Shipping Companies as a storage area for cargo shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai by the Nanhua liner. Recently, Taikoo's Chengdu and Jardine Matheson's Zesheng ships had just arrived from Hong Kong with a large batch of cargo, which was unloaded at the warehouse. At 6:40 p.m. yesterday, a wharf patrolman first discovered smoke coming from the windows of Warehouse No. 4 and immediately reported to warehouse manager Li Yunsheng, who urgently telegraphed the Fire Brigade to send fire trucks to the scene. At 7:00 p.m., the fire broke out in the warehouse. After the fire trucks arrived, the firefighting was greatly hampered due to the lack of tap water, and it was impossible to extinguish the fire. It was not until 7:50 p.m. that water arrived. Firefighters worked hard to extinguish the fire, and by 8:30 p.m., the raging fire was gradually extinguished. The upper floor of Warehouse No. 4, which stored goods from Hong Kong, mainly cigarettes and foreign paper, was mostly burned. Fortunately, the adjacent Warehouse No. 5 was preserved with great effort and was not affected. As for the cause of the fire, according to warehouse manager Li Yunsheng, the lower floor of the Jianghai Customs inspection room had a large batch of goods waiting to be inspected, including sulfuric acid and camphor powder, all of which are easily flammable. Yesterday's weather was also hot and humid. The fire was likely caused by careless placement, so the fire broke out in the inspection room, and the upper floor of Warehouse No. 4 was unfortunately affected, resulting in a complete fire. The total amount of goods burned will have to be determined by Taikoo and Jardine Matheson.

### The Bloody Battle of Jiangqiao Town Continues; Enemy and Us Confront Each Other Across the River at Zhoujia Bridge

Our Heavy Artillery Unit in Pudong Bombs Enemy Positions with Success; More Than a Dozen Enemy Aircraft Ravage Pudong This Afternoon; Our Loyal and Brave孤軍 in Zhabei Still Stand Firm

This newspaper's reporter met with a certain military authority this morning, who stated that our army's new positions have been actively arranged for days, the fortifications are strong, and the strength is strong. If the enemy continues to attack, they will be met with a head-on blow. As for a small part of the enemy reaching the north bank of the Suzhou River, the troops are now rushing to build defensive fortifications, and the two armies are shooting across the river at Zhoujia Bridge. The enemy has not dared to lightly attempt a偷渡. According to military news, (1) the enemy shelled Beixinjing and Huacao Town overnight, but our army suffered no damage. (2) The fierce battle in Jiangqiao Town continued until noon today and has not stopped. Our army is guarding along the Qiujiang, and the enemy has not succeeded in the end. (3) The enemy's heavy troops attacked our Xiaonanxiang position from multiple routes and were all repelled. Xiaonanxiang is still in our hands, and close contact has been established with the Jiangqiao area. (4) There was a fierce battle near Shixianggong Temple, and the front line in Guangfu Town has not changed. (5) Our troops withdrawing from Zhenru Town have all safely arrived on the north bank of the Suzhou River, and are mutually supporting our troops on the south bank. As for our 800 loyal and brave soldiers who are guarding the Sihang Warehouse in Zhabei, they are still standing in the enemy's陣中 today and are fighting a desperate battle with the enemy. On the roof of the warehouse building, the national flag with a blue sky, white sun, and a wholly red earth flutters high in the air, showing the glory of our national army. The people on the north bank of the Suzhou River, numbering in the thousands, pay tribute to our loyal and brave soldiers, and the flow of慰劳品 has not stopped. The enemy is having difficulty attacking and is wandering around the high-rise buildings, seemingly at a loss. It is rumored that the enemy is erecting three-inch-caliber guns to bombard the warehouse, that enemy aircraft will drop heavy bombs, and that the enemy plans to bury landmines to blow up the building. However, due to various considerations by the enemy, these plans will absolutely not be realized.

### Intense Battle at Zhoujia Bridge Across the River

Our Troops Firmly Hold the Henan Positions, Enemy Attempts to Cross the River Are Bound to Fail

From last night, in the Zhoujia Bridge area west of Avenue Bai Li Nan, the two armies have been engaged in a fierce battle across the river, exchanging machine gun and artillery fire. The battle is still ongoing this morning. When our reporter inspected the British defense area along Avenue Bai Li Nan and Avenue de President Doumer in western Shanghai this morning, the sound of machine guns from Zhoujia Bridge was as dense as a string of pearls, and the artillery fire was continuous, with one shot every ten or so seconds. Three or four enemy planes circled the area above, and when they flew over the British defense area on Avenue de President Doumer, the British immediately responded with anti-aircraft machine guns, firing three or four times, about thirty or forty rounds each time. The enemy planes flew very high and were not damaged. They did not dare to linger and left in an instant. The enemy's ambition to cross the river in the Zhoujia Bridge area has not diminished at all. Last night, when the moonlight was dim, they transported a large amount of timber, which was all destroyed by our air force that was dispatched last night. The Zhongshan Road Bridge and the south end of the Avenue de President Doumer iron bridge are heavily guarded by our troops, and the enemy is bound to fail in their attempts to cross the river.

A Central News Agency correspondent with the army reported at 1:15 PM on the 29th that fighting had begun in the Avenue de President Doumer area. The enemy launched an attack from Datong University at 7:00 PM last night, advancing towards Zhoujia Bridge. Both sides exchanged artillery fire first. At 11:00 PM, about four or five hundred enemy soldiers attempted to cross the river in the Zhongshan Road intersection area. Our troops responded with machine gun fire, the bullets as dense as rain, leaving the enemy with no chance to succeed. They quietly retreated. The enemy in the Zhenru area also advanced southward along the Zhenbei Road, holding positions at Panzhai, Jijiaku, Qijiacun, and other places on the north bank, engaging in a standoff with our troops. Our troops also formed a battle line on the north bank, with their backs to the river, holding Huangjiazhai (west of Zhenbei Road), Majiazhai, Xiazhai, and Quanjiazhai (east of Zhenbei Road), constructing solid defenses. At 4:00 AM this morning, the enemy attacked with two regiments, but they were routed by our three counterattacks, with over a hundred enemy soldiers killed. After the enemy retreated, they remained in confrontation with us, the two sides separated by less than a thousand meters.

### Enemy Fiercely Attacks Jiangqiao, Repelled

Our Troops in Zhenru Safely Retreat to the North Bank of the Suzhou River, Now Firmly Defending Along the Qiujiang River, Confronting the Enemy

Last night and this morning, the focus of the fighting remained on the line from Zhoujia Bridge to Beixinjing and Jiangqiao Town to Xiaonanxiang in western Shanghai, with the fighting in Jiangqiao Town being the most intense. From last night, enemy artillery fire was concentrated on the town, relentlessly bombarding it, attempting to break through this point and threaten our troops on the north bank of the Suzhou River north of Beixinjing. The bombardment continued this morning, and enemy planes also hovered and reconnoitered over our troop positions in the area. Our soldiers calmly responded to the battle. When the enemy advanced under the cover of artillery fire last night, our troops rushed forward fiercely, killing countless enemies. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and eventually retreated. Our Jiangqiao position remains extremely solid. The entire town of Jiangqiao has been bombarded by enemy artillery fire and bombs, turning it into a field of rubble.

Our troops in Zhenru and Pengpu broke through last night and have now safely retreated to the north bank of the Suzhou River, confronting the enemy along the Qiujiang River from Jiangqiao to Beixinjing and Zhoujia Bridge.

### Fierce Fighting in Xiaonanxiang Last Night

Enemy Fiercely Attacks Our Flank Positions, Briefly Breaching Them Before Being Repelled

Northwest of Jiangqiao Town, across the railway line to Xiaonanxiang, the fighting on this line was unusually fierce last night. The enemy continued to fiercely attack this point, attempting to reconnoiter Nanshiang. Last night, the enemy repeatedly attacked our forward positions in Xiaonanxiang, but they were all repulsed by our troops. They then changed their strategy of frontal attack, attacking the rear of Xiaonanxiang, breaking through at Sijiaqiao in the northwest. Our troops fought bravely, but they were able to advance to Tangqiaojiao and Lujiazhai, threatening the rear of our Xiaonanxiang position. Our reinforcements arrived from the rear and charged forward fiercely. Under enemy artillery fire, they finally routed the attacking enemy and recovered the points breached by the enemy. The forward positions in Xiaonanxiang have been fully restored. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties, and our troops also sustained losses. There were no changes at Guangfu and other points north of Xiaonanxiang. Our troops have not retreated to Dengqiao on the line of Shi Xiang Gong Temple. Our troops are only a few hundred meters away from Shi Xiang Gong Temple.

### Fierce Artillery Battle Unleashed in the Huangpu River

Mutual Bombardment Several Times Yesterday and Today, Enemy Ships Heavily Damaged, Enemy Burns Our Sheds and Massacres Our Civilians

Our artillery positions in Pudong launched another fierce artillery battle with enemy ships in the Huangpu River last night. The first battle was at 8:05 PM. Our troops first fired artillery, breaking the silence of the entire line. The enemy ships hastily returned fire in a coordinated manner. The shelling was quite dense. After about half an hour of fierce fighting, we fired a total of over thirty shells, many of which landed in the enemy positions in Zhabei, causing extreme chaos on their side. The enemy ships fired a total of over seventy shells, most of which landed in the fields. However, three or four sulfur shells landed in the sheds next to Pudong Avenue, east of Tangqiao Qingyang Road, igniting them immediately. Because some residents from Jiangbei were unable to escape, four people were tragically burned to death, and six were burned. The Pudong Fire Brigade was dispatched to provide assistance. Because the fire spread rapidly, also affecting the tile houses to the west, the fire was too large to control, and it was difficult to provide assistance. The fire was completely extinguished at 3:00 AM this morning, destroying over fifty sheds and forty tile houses. The second artillery battle began at 10:30 PM. Our side again fired first, and the enemy ships returned fire fiercely, sometimes densely and sometimes sparsely. When our air force first flew over Shanghai, the enemy ships stopped firing first. We continued to fire many shots to assist the air force in its operations. The third artillery battle began at 11:45 PM. Because the enemy ships had been severely damaged by us twice, they first fired in retaliation, concentrating their fire on the ×× area. However, our artillery teams, with their mission completed, only returned fire a few times and then ignored them. After the enemy ships bombarded for about twenty minutes, seeing that we did not react, they also stopped. After these three artillery battles, because the enemy shells were indiscriminate, several civilian houses in various places were bombed, killing five or six civilians. Those injured included Chen Zhanggen, Shi Deshun, Wei Zhaolin, Chen Longgen, Hang Qinshi, Ni Jinxiang, Bao Agen, Bao Lushi, Li Lushi, Chen Zhangshi, Yao Zhangshi, Yao Caishi, Fan Zhigen, and over ten other men and women. At 9:30 AM this morning, enemy ships again fiercely bombarded the Pudong area. At the same time, three enemy planes appeared in the sky from time to time, but they flew quite high and often disappeared into the clouds, making it difficult to perform their duties. The sound of enemy ship artillery fire was sometimes dense and sometimes sparse, and it had not stopped by noon. Our troops, undamaged, did not pay attention to it except to strengthen their guard along the entire line. Also, at 5:45 PM last night, three enemy heavy bombers flew from the Zhabei area to the rear of the old Sanjing warehouse in Pudong, dropping four bombs in succession, destroying seven civilian houses, and injuring three women, Zhou Azhen, Shao Wushi, and Zhang Qiaozhen. An old woman, Zhou Xiaoshi, was killed.

At around 12:40 PM this afternoon, more than ten enemy heavy bombers flew to Pudong again and indiscriminately bombed the area in retaliation. Our positions were not damaged at all.

### Our Air Force Night Raid Achieves Great Success

Destroys Enemy Ordnance Inside the Shanghai Grand Theatre

At around 1:00 AM this morning, our air force made its last raid on enemy positions in Shanghai. When it flew past the Shanghai Grand Theatre on North Sichuan Road, our planes dropped two incendiary bombs, which immediately ignited a fire that could not be approached. The theatre was almost completely destroyed, and the fire spread to more than ten nearby houses. It is said that the enemy troops inside the theatre had stored a large amount of ordnance, and their losses were enormous. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. Afterwards, our planes completed their mission and turned north to bomb the enemy positions at the North Station and the Lianglu Administration, but they missed their target. The bombs landed nearby and destroyed many houses.

### Enemy Generals Nakamura and Others Have Arrived in Shanghai

Enemy Ships Unload War Horses and Military Supplies, Four Torpedo Boats Arrive at the Songhu Estuary

Central News Agency reports that Tokyo has recently sent two lieutenant generals, Mutsu and Nakamura, to Shanghai to assist Matsui and others in carrying out their acts of aggression. The two lieutenant generals arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. After the enemy occupied our Zhabei and Jiangwan, they held a meeting of senior generals to discuss strategies for continuing their invasion. The two lieutenant generals also participated in the meeting. It has been found that Nakamura is one of the members of the enemy's War Against China Committee.

### Our Isolated Troops Vow to Protect Every Inch of Zhabei

The Public Admires Them, Cheering "Long Live!" Across the Suzhou River, Enemy Troops Fiercely Attacked More Than Ten Times Last Night, All Repelled

Our brave isolated troops in Zhabei remain safely stationed in the Four Banks Warehouse as of this afternoon. Although enemy troops have attacked several times from last night until this morning, they have all been repelled by our troops. Moreover, at 7:30 AM this morning, more than ten enemy soldiers who attacked were killed, and the rest were seriously injured and escaped. Thinking of our troops who are resolutely defending the area cannot help but fill one with respect and cause one to bow one's head in contemplation, marveling at the greatness of the Chinese nation, which cannot be easily insulted by the enemy. Currently, the entire public has expressed sympathy for the arduous struggle of our brave isolated troops and is willing to provide support. In addition to raising a large amount of food to be delivered to them, people from European and American countries are also amazed at the eternity and immortality of our national spirit. The highest military authorities are also paying close attention, and a telegram was sent to Shanghai yesterday.

National Flag Flies, Public Pays Respect

The loyal and brave soldiers who are defending the Four Banks Warehouse on Guangfu Road in Zhabei at the cost of their lives presented a Blue Sky with a White Sun flag, which was obtained by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at 4:00 PM yesterday, through the No. 41 Girl Scout. It was raised to the top of the warehouse at around 6:00 PM. This morning, as the dawn broke, the national flag fluttered, showing their spirit of loyalty, bravery, and vigor. Members of the public who passed by the area across the river took off their hats and bowed, paying their respects to the national flag and the loyal and brave soldiers.

Brave Soldiers Shout "Long Live the Republic of China!"

At 3:00 AM and 7:10 AM this morning, enemy troops twice charged our positions at the warehouse, but they were both repelled by our troops. At daybreak this morning, reporters went to Avenue Edward VII and Changsha Road to investigate. At that time, the area was already crowded with people who wanted to see our loyal and brave soldiers. When our citizens saw the Blue Sky with a White Sun on a field of red national flag fluttering on the roof of the Four Banks Warehouse and in the windows, they rejoiced and cheered, clapping their hands. The troops guarding the warehouse responded by shouting "Long Live the Republic of China!" The voices were extremely tragic. After a while, the sound of rifles rang out, as more than ten enemy soldiers came charging. The nearby police, fearing stray bullets, earnestly advised the citizens to disperse. At that time, the sound of machine guns rang out. It was our troops firing, aiming at the enemy and sweeping them away, killing several enemy soldiers, and the rest fled in panic. At 7:10 AM, there was sparse rifle fire again. It was the enemy's second charge, but the result was that they were repelled by our loyal and brave soldiers. Since then, there have been no more attacks, but the enemy in the Qianye United Warehouse and the Shanghai Bank warehouse next door have been constantly firing rifles at the location. In order to save ammunition, our troops are ignoring it. Some passersby were moved to tears, which shows the public's love and support for the soldiers.

Enemy Troops Fiercely Attack, Repelled by Us

Our eight hundred loyal and brave soldiers, with the determination to sacrifice themselves heroically, are fighting a desperate battle with the enemy. This kind of noble and great spirit has won infinite admiration internationally. This morning, a reporter went to Xinzha Road and inspected the area by the river for two hours. From a distance, I saw our bright and dazzling Blue Sky with a White Sun on a field of red national flag fluttering on the roof of the Four Banks Warehouse, an aura of inviolability, which truly demonstrates the soul of the Chinese nation, making the brutal enemy afraid to approach. The Fuyuan and Fukang Qianzhuang United Warehouse to the west has been occupied by the enemy. There are thirty or forty enemy soldiers on the roof of the warehouse, busily making defensive preparations to prevent our troops from attacking. The enemy troops near the northern end of the Wuzhen Road Bridge are also piling up sandbags, making defensive works. After 8:00 AM, the sound of rifles, machine guns, and hand grenades was incessant in the northwest corner of the Four Banks Warehouse, as the enemy troops attacked from Guoging Road and Guangfu Road. At the intersection of Wuzhen Road and Kulun Road, the enemy troops are setting up a steel gun battery, seemingly attempting to destroy the warehouse building. According to the owner of a store near the southern end of the Wuzhen Bridge on Xinzha Road, the enemy troops launched more than ten attacks last night, and the sound of rifles, machine guns, and hand grenades was incessant, but they were all repelled by our loyal and brave soldiers, and sixty or seventy enemy soldiers were killed, so that the enemy troops did not dare to approach the warehouse. The reporter went to the Xinlaji Bridge area again at 10:00 AM to investigate. Because the police were afraid that stray bullets would injure or kill passersby, they had blocked the Xinzha Wujiao Port on Avenue Yu Xiaqing with barbed wire. However, there were many people in the area, carrying bread, soy sauce, refined salt, and other food, preparing to send them to the soldiers, but they could not enter, which they were very moved by, which shows the deep concern of the people in the rear for our loyal and brave soldiers.

Enemy Plane Shot and Wounded But Still Escapes

At 10:30 AM this morning, an enemy plane flew low and circled over the Four Banks Warehouse, reconnoitering the movements of our eight hundred heroes. Our troops immediately opened fire with rifles, hitting the tail of the plane. The plane suddenly swayed from side to side, teetering on the verge of falling, but it still managed to escape back to its original position.

### Enemy Ships Bombard Xiamen Fortress

Jinmen Refugees Flee in Droves, Xiamen's Coastal Defenses Are Extremely Solid

[Xiamen] After the enemy occupied Jinmen, the number of enemy ships in the waters between Jinmen and Xiamen increased to two or three, mostly docked in the southern part of Jin Island. At 9:00 AM and 11:00 AM on the 28th, four ships twice bombarded the Baishi Battery and Beiqi firing positions of the Xiamen Fortress, but because of the distance, they all landed in the water and then retreated. On the 28th, the enemy marines continued to search and loot in Jinmen, detaining strong young men from various villages. Many women and young people were abducted and raped. Refugees fled to Xiamen by the thousands on the 26th and 27th, and three or four thousand fled to Tong'an. Compatriots from Xiamen organized relief teams, and on the 28th, they sent personnel to Jinmen to try to provide relief to the refugees and help them escape from danger. Currently, strong men in the villages of Xiyuan in the northern part of Jin Island are still resisting. The enemy is advancing northward. County Magistrate Kuang Han is still working on Dadaeng Island. The person detained by the ×× Division is Liao Bingtao, the head of the First District. The coastal defenses of Xiamen and Tong'an are extremely solid. (Special dispatch on the 28th)

### Tianjin-Pukou Railway Front Silent

[Xuzhou] Railway news. News from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway front is silent. The enemy is exerting all its strength in the Shanghai battle, and it seems that it does not have the ability to advance on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. We have set up strict fortifications on the Yucheng line to defend against enemy attacks. Guerrilla units have penetrated deep into the northern section to attack and raid. (Special dispatch on the 28th)

### US Representative Arrives in Brussels, Germany Has Received Invitation and Will Likely Accept

British Foreign Secretary Pleased with US Cooperation

[Paris] Davis, the chief representative of the United States at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, arrived here yesterday from the United States and has already left for Brussels this afternoon. (Central News Agency dispatch from Havas on the 28th)

[London] During the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Cranborne made a declaration on the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, saying that it was gratifying that the conference venue was changed from Geneva to Brussels so that the United States could participate in the conference on an equal footing with other relevant countries, instead of just sending observers to attend. (Central News Agency dispatch from Havas on the 28th)

[Berlin] Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the invitation issued by the Belgian government was delivered to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs this afternoon. The foreign affairs authorities immediately studied it. According to well-informed sources, the German government will accept the invitation to participate in the conference. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 28th)

[Paris] The Times recently commented on Japan's refusal to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, saying that although the conference will not have Japan's participation, it can still carry out beneficial work and allow countries related to the Far East issue to discuss the changes that have occurred in China and the relationship between these changes and the principles contained in the Nine-Power Treaty. The League of Nations recently avoided interfering in the dispute between China and Japan, which was extremely wise. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference will also definitely not attempt to interfere. If this conference can study various mediation methods to promote a quick resolution of the dispute between China and Japan, it can be said to be beneficial. The "Righteous People's Discussion" reported that "the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will try to protect the interests that the relevant countries hold in the Far East. Apart from this, it may be difficult to carry out any effective work. The bravery of the Chinese army in resisting the war is beyond Japan's expectations. I fear that Japan will eventually have to end the war to save face." (Central News Agency dispatch from Havas on the 28th)

[Moscow] Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the Soviet government's newspaper, News, recently commented that it is clumsy and useless to convene a conference to discuss practical measures to stop illegal and sinful adventures. On the contrary, if the directly related countries can take joint action to deal with the aggression on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean, that would be enough. After the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is held in Beijing, a new non-interference committee may soon be established, which is not certain. It is intended that Germany and Italy have obviously obtained Japan's permission to send personnel to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, in order to represent the allied countries that specialize in aggression and violate international treaties. In this way, even if Japan does not attend, there will be people to speak for it. It is a pity that the so-called Western democratic countries do not have the necessary determination and perseverance to maintain peace in the Far East. In the United States, Japan's aggression is a very serious blow to the interests that the United States holds in the Liaodong region. President Roosevelt expressed a more practical attitude towards maintaining peace in his recent speech. This diplomatic policy of the United States may contribute something to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. (Central News Agency dispatch from Havas on the 28th)

[Washington] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting said in a speech at the National Press Club luncheon today that China has made more progress in the past ten years than in the past hundred years, and in many ways, it has surpassed Japan. Japan is worried that China will complete its work, so it is fighting against China in order to stop its progress, but Japan will definitely not succeed. The Chinese people are determined to resist to the end, and even if they have only one soldier and one bullet left, they will fight. (Central News Agency dispatch from Reuters on the 28th)

### British Military Authorities Express Continued Efforts to Defend Western Shanghai

Evacuate Overseas Chinese to Avoid Accidents, Rumors of Abandonment Are Completely Untrue

After the war front moved, the situation in the western Shanghai outer road area became tense. The area was filled with dense gunfire and stray bullets all day long. British Consul General in Shanghai Phillips immediately issued a notice, fearing that the war would expand and affect residents, so he advised Western expatriates to evacuate when necessary to avoid danger. From today (the 29th), Western expatriates residing in the area of Avenue Entingy, Avenue Haig, Yuyuan Road, Avenue Bai Li Nan, and Avenue de President Doumer have begun to evacuate, and boxes and luggage are filling the streets in an endless stream. The troops stationed here and the police are taking care of everything, so the order is good. However, after the notice was issued, a rumor suddenly arose in the city that the concession authorities would abandon police power in the western Shanghai area, and that the air forces stationed in the outer road sections of all countries would retreat. According to British military authorities, they will not take this measure and absolutely deny the rumor. They also said that evacuating overseas Chinese is one thing, and continuing to do their best to defend the area is another.

### Mail Inquiries Should Be Made to the Management Bureau

### Trivia

— Xiang

The August 13th War of Resistance. We had already decided our destiny. Prepared for great sacrifice. Great destruction. But never compromise with the enemy. Never stop halfway. This is the predetermined decision of our country's military authorities. It has been nearly three months since the start of the war. With the superiority of the enemy's weapons, it is not easy for us to obtain absolute victory. However, since the enemy started the war, there have been more than 70,000 casualties. The price they paid cannot be said to be insignificant. Although we have not achieved the greatest military victory, there have been many victories outside the military sphere. 1. The War of Resistance has led to national unity. 2. Soldiers have gained rich experience. 3. Increased determination to resist the enemy. The above three points are not only of great hope for the military, but also of infinite optimism for the spirit of the nation. The enemy should not boast about the small victories in front of them. Xiang Yu experienced more than 70 battles and never lost, but in the end he committed suicide on the Wu River. Let's see the results of this war.

### Front and Rear (2)

— Special Correspondent Uncle Di

Therefore, the reporter first raised the following question: 'Since the outbreak of this Sino-Japanese War, looking at the objective situation from all sides, and the determination expressed by both the government and the public, it seems that the war will not stop until the very end. If this continues, it may evolve into a world war. Then, in Mr. Chen's opinion, is there a possibility for China and Japan to call a halt to the war at a certain stage?'

Mr. Chen said: 'That is possible.'

Then, he explained further: 'The ultimate goal of the Chinese nation's resistance war is liberation and national construction. However, such a goal may not be achievable through a single war. When the war reaches a certain stage, perhaps due to the evolution of various situations, under certain conditions, we may have a chance to breathe and temporarily call a halt to the war to facilitate the next resistance war…'

'Then, what are the so-called certain conditions…!' The reporter interrupted him.

'For example, the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Shanghai, the return of Peiping and Tianjin, ... and so on. However, interference in internal affairs is no longer tolerable! If it goes on like this, it will be a situation of partial peace.'

"Generally speaking, it seems that if there is to be 'peace,' it must be complete; since it is 'partial,' objectively speaking, it will not be 'peaceful'?" The reporter tentatively added.

'In fact, the enemy will not even allow us a partial peace.' One of the people present added.

Chen Guangsheng then said with emotion: 'Therefore, even a situation of partial peace requires a very difficult struggle. Here, there are three decisive forces: first, military force; second, the power of the people; and third, international support.'

The theme of the conversation fell on the prospects of victory or defeat in this war. The reporter then took the opportunity to ask Mr. Chen the following question:

"Looking at the overall situation from all aspects, we cannot find a point of certain victory, nor can we see a point of certain defeat. So, regarding the issue of the victory or defeat of this anti-Japanese war, which is of concern to the whole world and anxiety to all of China, what is Mr. Chen's opinion?"

'In my opinion,' Mr. Chen said, 'Judging by military strength alone, we are far behind. However, our most powerful weapons are the assistance of friendly countries internationally and the mobilization of the vast masses of the people nationwide to serve as the backbone of the war.' The reporter briefly described some of what he knew about the situation between friendly countries and China, using these as a starting point, and then asked Mr. Chen:

'What are Mr. Chen's thoughts on the recently announced Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact?'

Mr. Chen immediately said in an impassioned tone: 'From the perspective of resistance strength, if all the agreements between China and the Soviet Union are limited to the announced agreements, then at this time, it is really of no use!.'

Due to the entanglement of international relations in Europe, Soviet Russia decided to use all its strength to help us. Conversely, assuming that Soviet Russia really openly and frankly stood up to help China, then, in the current international environment, it may instead be detrimental to China's resistance war, it is also unknown,' Mr. Chen said.

From Mr. Chen's words, I infer that his meaning is probably that China's resistance war this time should, as much as possible, obtain the assistance of all countries in the world other than Japanese imperialists, and should not prematurely limit itself, excluding a portion of countries from military assistance.

If my understanding of Mr. Chen's opinion is correct, then the next question is: Is this idea of hoping to obtain assistance from all countries in the world just a fantasy?

I tentatively asked: 'The formation of two major blocs internationally is progressing rapidly. If China wants to be completely liberated, it must use this international situation in the future. However, looking back on China's current resistance war, on the eve of the international situation not being fully mature, China seems to not need to emphasize this situation?'

Mr. Chen nodded in agreement.

Another issue is the mobilization of the masses.

I spoke first: 'Mobilizing the vast masses to support this comprehensive and protracted war against Japan is, in principle, a consensus of opinion from all sides. If the Chinese nation wants to achieve victory in the anti-Japanese war, it can only be achieved by mobilizing the entire people.'

'Yes.' Mr. Chen interrupted me and added: 'Seeking victory in the current war is certainly the most immediate task of mobilizing the masses; however, the greatest goal is to guarantee future victory. In other words, even if military defeat is inevitable for China at present, we must resist to the end and hope to achieve final victory. That task can only be shouldered by mobilizing the vast masses.'

### Xiamen Municipal Government Holds Supplemental Levy on Taxpayers of Taiwanese Origin Who Fraudulently Obtained Residency

Past Unpaid Taxes and Levies are Cleared and Paid Retroactively, Hereafter All Taxes Will be Paid in Accordance with Regulations Like Nationals

Xiamen Correspondence, The number of Taiwanese Japanese nationals residing in Xiamen is close to 20,000, accounting for more than one-tenth of the total population of Xiamen. Recently, the Taiwanese people have carried out a general evacuation, and more than 2,000 people have not left. The municipal government then held a registration of Taiwanese people. It is estimated that more than 1,020 Taiwanese people in the Xiamen urban area have registered in accordance with the order, and 300 people in the suburban Heshan District have almost all registered. 700 to 800 people are hiding in the Gulangyu Concession, and the Public Concession is also holding registration. Only 240 people have registered. There are many Taiwanese people in Xiamen, and all industries are represented. In the past, relying on the power of the Japanese, they resisted the payment of taxes on their industrial and commercial operations and their real estate, land, and farmland. As for the movable property of all industries in Xiamen, according to a estimate by the Taiwan Shinmin Daily News the year before last, it was more than 26 million yuan. Therefore, the loss of tax revenue suffered by our country is extremely large. At the same time, Chinese businessmen are unable to compete because of the tax burden. A small number of unscrupulous Chinese people colluded with the Taiwanese people to fraudulently use the Taiwanese identity. This time, the municipal government held registration, and 120 Chinese businessmen who fraudulently used the Taiwanese identity registered their letters of repentance and offered national defense funds. On the 18th, the municipal government issued a notice on the method of collecting and supplementing the taxes owed by Taiwanese and fraudulently registered merchants. The notice roughly stated, 'According to the report of the Finance Bureau, the Taiwanese merchants in our city only paid 1,000 yuan per month to the Taiwan Association as police donations for various taxes that should be paid in the past, and did not comply with the regulations in other respects. Even Chinese merchants have fraudulently registered to resist donations, which has affected tax revenue. Now, although most of the Taiwanese merchants have returned to their country, there are still many who operate and reside in this city. In particular, many of their leased properties, shops, houses, and land are leased to Chinese merchants for use. All kinds of taxes and rents that should be paid should be ordered to be completed in accordance with the regulations together with the citizens. The unpaid taxes and donations from the past should also be cleared and supplemented. A method is proposed and submitted for approval.' It was approved by the provincial government and reported to the Xiamen Garrison Headquarters for record, and the Finance Bureau was ordered to comply with it quickly. The notice is hereby issued. The following is a summary of the Xiamen Municipal Finance Bureau's method of collecting and supplementing various taxes and rents owed by Taiwanese and fraudulently registered merchants in this city. ㊀ Taiwanese or fraudulently registered merchants shall pay and register from August onwards and taxes will be calculated and levied according to regulations. Those before August shall be required to submit receipts and certificates issued by the former Taiwan Association on behalf of the municipal government and police stations within a time limit. If there is a shortage, it must still be supplemented. If the aforementioned receipts and certificates cannot be submitted within the time limit, the amount of owed donations shall be calculated at the rate and supplemented. ㊁ Taiwanese or fraudulently registered merchants shall pay shop tax, land rent, business tax, license tax, slaughter tax, and all other taxes and rents stipulated in the same way as citizens. Various taxes that were owed in the past shall be cleared separately, and the total amount shall be calculated, and they shall be ordered to pay in installments. The method will be determined separately. ㊂ Taiwanese or Japanese merchants shall pay various taxes and rents that should be paid and supplemented by the current residents, operators, or tenants, agents, etc. They shall be responsible for paying on behalf of the business households or the income of the shop owner. If there is no one living or operating in the house or shop, they will wait for someone to take over or live in and assume the responsibility, and they will be handled according to the above method. ㊃ Taiwanese merchants who rent real estate within the boundaries of this city shall comply with the method of tax deeds for foreigners who permanently lease housing land promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. If they are fraudulently postponing taxes, the business households or agents shall be ordered to submit the deeds within a time limit and pay taxes in accordance with the regulations. ㊄ The currently operating Taiwanese and fraudulently registered brothels and prostitutes shall be ordered to report their brands and pay donations in accordance with the regulations, otherwise they will be ordered to close down. ㊅ If Taiwanese merchants and Chinese merchants jointly operate industrial and commercial enterprises or jointly own real estate, and the shares of the Taiwanese people have been transferred to Chinese merchants, they shall be ordered to submit proof documents. After verification, the various taxes and rents that should be paid shall be paid by the current business owner or the current business owner. The households are responsible for paying. If the discount has not been made or proof cannot be provided, the outstanding taxes owed in the past shall be paid in full by the current shop owner or owner. The amount paid on behalf of the Taiwanese people shall be deducted from the income of the Taiwanese people. However, if there are any outstanding payments for the part that should be paid by Chinese merchants, they shall still be supplemented in full. ㊆ If Taiwanese or fraudulently registered merchants fail to comply with the above methods for paying taxes and supplementing donations, the bureau may send their responsible persons to the police to collect them. ㊇ This method will be implemented from the date of approval by the provincial government for record. The provincial government recently established a 'Guidance Committee for Naturalized Taiwanese People' in the provincial capital and plans to establish a branch in Xiamen. The Anti-Enemy Association will coordinate with various organizations to organize the naturalization procedures for Taiwanese people. ㊀ First apply to the local government for registration to obtain nationality, ㊁ Investigate the previous occupation of Taiwanese people and what skills they have, and introduce them to appropriate occupations to enable them to make a living in peace. ㊂ Send people to have individual political talks or public speeches with them to make them all have a national concept, enhance their anti-enemy sentiment, and participate in practical national salvation work. After Xiamen held the registration of Taiwanese people last month, more than 200 people have applied to renounce their Japanese nationality and restore their Chinese nationality. As for the Taiwanese people who withdrew from Xiamen to Taiwan, the Japanese government set up two major detention centers in Keelung City to accommodate them, sent police to monitor their actions, and were not allowed to leave Keelung City for other parts of the interior of Taiwan, fearing that they had lived in China for a long time and had the national ideology of the motherland, which would be passed on to the islanders. Therefore, the Taiwanese people all call them human cages. The extent of their foolishness and defense against the people can be seen from their hard work. (October 21)

### Final Victory Under Overall Resistance War (Continued)

— Zhao Weizu

Third, in the military direction, Japan is also in a dangerous situation everywhere. China's war of resistance is the mobilization of the entire nation. Everyone contributes manpower and material resources to supply the country, while Japan only has the ambition of a few warlords. In terms of the soldiers' hearts and the public's psychology, there is no strong self-confidence. Our country has been stimulated for many years, and the impression of Japan's evil is deeply rooted. Therefore, everyone has the determination to die. Looking at the Japanese soldiers' operations this time, most of them are not voluntary. Some have fled, and some have committed suicide. If the war is prolonged, the soldiers will definitely rebel against the officers. The ability to fight depends entirely on their general psychology. If the psychology is unstable, it will not be easy to win the war. Now, let's classify them: ㊀ Japanese regular soldiers have no combat ability: The Japanese regular army has only 27 divisions, about 500,000 people. The equipment held by these 500,000 people is excellent, but most of these active 500,000 people have an unstable psychology and little war experience. Because Japan has a conscription system, the so-called regular soldiers are new recruits. Although they have been trained for many years, and they are all 17 or 18-year-old youths, these youths have unstable souls, no combat experience, and no determination to fight. In fact, it is difficult to participate in combat. However, due to the Japanese system, they know that these people cannot fight, but they have no choice but to send some of them to China. ㊁ Reservists and veterans have no combat ability: Japan's reservists and veterans are all people who have been away from the military for a long time, and even do not hold exercises at all. They are shopkeepers, clerks, farmers, elementary school teachers, and machine office workers. They have always lived a stable social life, enjoying a comfortable life. At home, they have gentle and harmonious parents, brothers, lively and lovely wives, children, and daughters. Once they are asked to take guns and cross the distant ocean to fight China for no reason, their families will definitely suffer, and even their lives will have problems. They know that war requires life to be exchanged for territory. How can they be willing to give up their good families? How much effect will it have to send these veterans who are unfamiliar with war to fight others? As for the Chinese army, it is a recruitment system. Chinese soldiers are a profession. After they join the army, they live in the barracks all the time. If they do not die in battle or become disabled or old, they will not stop this life. They are all standing experienced soldiers and have no family nostalgia. Therefore, they have the nature and discipline of pure soldiers who are cheerful and brave. They only know how to defend the country and obey orders, and regard this as their duty. In addition to performing this duty, there is no more glorious task than war. Now it is a fact that the Japanese army has occupied our North China, it is also a fact that hundreds of enemy ships and hundreds of planes have bombarded Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Anhui, and Jiangxi with artillery and bombs, and it is also a fact that tens of thousands of enemy troops have launched an aggressive war in Zhabei and Wusong. These facts are all placed before our eyes and deeply imprinted in the minds of our soldiers. There is no need for officers to explain and explain to them. They will naturally charge towards the enemy, destroy the enemy with the determination to die, and defend the country with the determination to die. When everyone is performing his duty, his bravery and loyalty are conceivable. ㊂ The puppet Manchu army refuses to be used by him; In this North China and Songhu battle, Japan incorporated the slave puppet Manchu army into the battle because the army was not enough to control. This is a suicidal policy. The suffering suffered by the people of East China for six years has never ceased to think of revenge, but there is no opportunity. If propaganda and explanation are added, their rebellion will be as easy as turning their hands. According to this comparison of the three items, Japan is using deception and coercion to pull the people and puppet troops across the ocean to fight, and we are being directly inspired by the aggressors to resist the aggressors. They are being deceived and forced to invade other people's operations, one is automatic, the other is passive. Since the tasks of the two sides in the war are different, the effects are naturally different. As for who will win or lose in the war constituted by these two armies, everyone can judge. Our country has an old saying: 'The teacher who is sad wins' How can China not win?

Based on this observation, it fully shows that the Japanese army does not have the strength for a long-term war, while China has the determination to resist to the end. These factors all expose Japan's weakness in not being able to have a long-term war with China. Prime Minister Konoe once said on the way back from visiting Prince Saionji in Hakone: 'If the war against China is prolonged, it will fall into China's tactics, so we will try our best to avoid a long-term war and quickly take effective solutions. This clearly shows that Japan cannot have a long-term war. If China can unite as a country, not yield, not compromise, and resist to the end, then we can verify what Chairman Chiang said, 'The final victory belongs to us. '"

Finally, we must grasp the following three points: first, have confidence; second, do not seek luck; third, do not be content and compromise.
