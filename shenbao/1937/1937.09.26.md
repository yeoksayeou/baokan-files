### The Enemy's Fourth Wave of Reinforcements Arrives, Plotting a Major Offensive, But We Are Determined to Inflict a Crushing Blow

Our Forces Make Significant Gains in Luodian and Liuhang. Only Minor Skirmishes Occur Outside the Artillery Battles at Jiangwan and Zhabei. Our Air Force Conducts a Night Raid, Heavily Bombarding Enemy Positions.

The entire Shanghai battlefront was quite calm yesterday. Apart from the artillery battles in Luodian, Liuhang, Jiangwan, and Zhabei, there were only minor skirmishes involving local outposts. The enemy has admitted to facing unexpectedly strong resistance from our forces, so they dare not attempt an offensive until reinforcements arrive to replenish their numbers. Of the enemy's fourth wave of reinforcements, consisting of 40,000 troops, another 5,000 arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. In total, approximately 20,000 have already landed. It is expected that once all of the enemy's reinforcements arrive, they will launch a major offensive. However, our forces are defending strongly and are well-prepared, and we will certainly inflict a crushing blow when the time comes. A major battle, unprecedented in scale, is likely to occur within the next week. Last night and this morning, our air force twice raided enemy positions in Yangshupu, carrying out heavy bombing. The enemy was caught off guard and suffered significant losses.

### Our Air Force Twice Raids Enemy Positions at Night

Bombing Successful, Planes Return Safely

At 10:55 PM last night, our air force again soared over enemy ships in the Huangpu River and enemy positions in eastern Shanghai, carrying out bombing raids. The sound of the planes came from north to south, and searchlights and red signals on enemy ships immediately flew into the sky, while the sound of anti-aircraft guns and machine guns also progressed from north to south. After about twenty minutes, the sound of the planes faded away, and the enemy's anti-aircraft fire also ceased.

At 1:17 AM this morning, our air force continued its second night raid, first flying to enemy ammunition depots in the Yangshupu area of eastern Shanghai, carrying out heavy bombing, and then flying over enemy ships in the Huangpu River, dropping several bombs. The sound of the explosions shook the surrounding area, and the enemy also fired densely into the air with anti-aircraft guns. Our air force, having completed its mission, flew away calmly. The nature of this attack was even more intense than the first.

According to the Central News Agency, while enemy aircraft were wantonly slaughtering our non-combatant personnel in the rear, a team of our loyal and brave air force, at 11:00 PM last night, demonstrated their divine power by appearing over enemy positions. When our aircraft were in Shanghai's airspace, enemy ships fired anti-aircraft guns in unison, but our forces safely passed over them, bombed enemy positions in the Yangshupu and front-line areas, inflicted heavy damage, and then returned safely.

According to the Central News Agency, a team of our air force returned to Shanghai's airspace at 1:10 AM this morning, attacking enemy positions. Amidst the dense firing of anti-aircraft guns and machine guns from enemy ships, they fought relentlessly, dropping more than ten bombs, the sound of which shook the surrounding area, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. After about ten minutes, they all returned safely.

### Enemy's Fourth Wave of Reinforcements Continues to Arrive Yesterday Morning, With 5,000 More Soldiers

The number of those landing has reached 20,000. A major battle will take place next week.

According to the Central News Agency, of the enemy's fourth wave of reinforcements, totaling approximately 40,000 troops, a portion of about 5,000 men arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 6:30 AM, 7:00 AM, 8:15 AM, and 12:00 PM, respectively, on the No. 60 transport ship Tsurushima Maru, the No. 112 transport ship Ceylon Maru, the No. 336 transport ship Shinzuimaru, and the transport ship No. 116 (name unknown), all of which were converted from enemy merchant ships. The first two docked at the Huangpu Wharf, and the latter two docked at the Osaka and Huishan Wharfs, respectively. The enemy reinforcements immediately disembarked separately. In addition, large numbers of enemy horses were unloaded at the Huishan and Huangpu Wharfs. In total, over the past four days, the number of enemy troops landing at various wharfs in the eastern Shanghai area has reached approximately 20,000, not including those landing at various ports along the river. It is reported that all of the enemy's reinforcements will arrive within the next few days, and a major battle, unprecedented in scale, is expected to unfold within the next week.

### We Maintain Absolute Advantage in the Shanghai Battle; Any Further Enemy Offensives Will Be Crushed

Soldiers Vow Not to Coexist with the Enemy; We Are Prepared for the Enemy's Use of Poison Gas

According to the Central News Agency, our forces currently hold an absolute advantage in the Shanghai battle. The enemy forces on the Luodian and Liuhang lines have been repeatedly defeated by us, and they are in a state of demoralization. They have urgently requested a fourth wave of reinforcements from their home country. The current reinforcements, numbering approximately 40,000, have largely arrived. It is reported that the enemy has declared that they will launch a fourth general offensive starting tomorrow, but yesterday's front-line situation was not more intense than in the past few days. After repeatedly inflicting heavy damage on the enemy, our front-line soldiers are even more confident and determined to win victory. Furthermore, the enemy's current reinforcements are mostly conscripted from places like Taiwan and Korea, and their strength is not to be feared. Any enemy offensive will inevitably be met with a crushing defeat. However, the enemy, having suffered repeated defeats, has become enraged and, in addition to sending aircraft to wantonly bomb our rear areas every day, has repeatedly falsely accused us of using poison gas bombs and dumdum bullets. It is suspected that this is a prelude to the enemy's use of such inhumane weapons of war. According to those who came to Shanghai from the front line yesterday, our front-line soldiers are filled with anger at the enemy's wanton bombing of non-combatants in the rear, and they have vowed not to coexist with the enemy under the same sky. They are also prepared for the enemy's use of cruel weapons of war.

### Our Troops Advance on the Right Flank of Luodian

Reaching the Xinxing Township and Ligongbang Area

On the Luodian front, our troops on the right flank, along the Panjing line, engaged in fierce battles with the enemy throughout the day. Despite enemy aircraft and artillery fire, they bravely advanced, one after another, and finally defeated the enemy, advancing eastward. They have now reached the Xinxing Township and Ligongbang area, where they are engaged in intense battles with the enemy. They are still in a stalemate as of this morning.

### Enemy Ships Increase Suddenly in the Huangpu River Yesterday

A total of 29 ships, aiming to spy on Pudong. The enemy erects an observation post in the Huangpu River and transports a large amount of military supplies for unloading.

In front of the Chunjiang Wharf, there was originally one enemy gunboat anchored, with many soldiers on board. At 4:20 PM yesterday, the ship suddenly moved eastward, with its bow no longer facing Lujiazui, and its hull anchored in the center of the river in front of Zhongzhan, about 1,000 feet east of its original position. It is unknown what its purpose was. Five minutes later, one of the enemy's 22nd Squadron destroyers rushed in, turned around inside the Baidu Bridge in the center of the river, and headed to the center of the river off the Bund on Beijing Road, with its bow facing Pudong. After this ship arrived, one large destroyer, No. 1, also sailed in from downstream and stopped in front of the Jardine Matheson & Co. Wharf. Before these two ships arrived, two enemy ships from the 1st Squadron had already stopped in front of the Zhongbei Wharf. Thus, including the Izumo in the No. 2 river tube, a total of seven enemy ships were docked in this corner. The 22nd Squadron destroyer, which was docked in the center of the Bund on Beijing Road, was also quite close to the location where the US flagship was stationed. At 4:31 PM, the Izumo suddenly used flag signals to communicate with the 22nd Squadron ship for about ten minutes. The 22nd Squadron ship suddenly retreated again and stopped near the Izumo. After seeing it move away, the reporter returned promptly.

According to the Dagong News, at about 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon, when the tide was high in the Huangpu River, suddenly six enemy ships sailed one after another to the area near the Mitsubishi Wharf next to the Japanese Consulate and docked. Moreover, one of them even sailed to the Bund on Beijing Road and docked on the Shanghai Ferry river surface. At the same time, it used flag signals to communicate with the 3rd Squadron flagship 'Izumo'. It then sailed away after about twenty minutes. The enemy's attempt to invade our Pudong seems to be in progress at all times.

According to the Dagong News, the enemy flagship 'Izumo', which is docked on the No. 2 buoy on the river surface of the Gonghexiang Wharf, has taken various measures to defend against attacks by our land and air forces. In addition to stealing several of our civilian ships, building a semi-circular defensive structure near the south side of the ship, and wantonly dismantling the Huangpu River buoys, it has also arbitrarily enclosed the waterway in the area of the Japanese Consulate's river surface to prohibit ships from passing through. Starting today, an observation post will be erected on a wooden boat on the south side of the ship, about ten meters from the shore and about ten meters high. A machine gun will be mounted on the post to spy on our Pudong. Its ingenuity is clearly evident. According to the Central News Agency, 29 enemy ships were docked in the Huangpu River yesterday. In addition to a few ships firing artillery shells at our Pudong positions from time to time, several ships were also cruising back and forth, attempting to land. The details of their docking are as follows: the Mitsubishi Wharf has one No. 1 and one No. 11 destroyer each, the China Merchants North Wharf has one gunboat and one Wanguang Maru each, the Huishan Wharf has one Red Cross ship, one Tsukugo Maru and one No. 116 transport ship each, the Osaka Wharf has one Sixth Wenhai Maru and one Shinzuimaru each, the Huangpu Wharf has one Tsurushima Maru and one Ceylon Maru each, the New Mitsui Wharf has one gunboat, and the No. 40, No. 38, No. 37, No. 8, No. 7, No. 4, No. 3, and No. 1 buoys each have one destroyer. The No. 5 buoy has two destroyers, and the No. 31, No. 27, No. 22, No. 13, No. 11, and No. 9 buoys each have one gunboat. The No. 2 buoy has one cruiser Izumo. The above includes one cruiser, one Red Cross ship, twelve destroyers, eight gunboats, and seven transport ships, totaling 29 ships. From 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM yesterday morning, two enemy transport ships entered the port and docked at the Huishan Wharf and Gonghexiang Wharf, respectively. They immediately unloaded a large amount of military supplies, and the work was still not completed by 9:30 AM. It is reported that this batch of military supplies mainly consisted of artillery ammunition and mechanized equipment. At the same time, a mechanized unit of about 500 people also landed.

### The Entire Liuhang Line Temporarily Becomes Quiet

Our Troops Advance Under Artillery Fire, Recapturing Villages Such As Shengjiazhai and Xiaomiao

The enemy in the Yanghang area has been fiercely attacking our positions along the Yangmu Bridge area on the front of Liuhang for several days. Our troops have been bravely fighting back. By dawn on the 24th, the enemy, having suffered heavy casualties, was unable to withstand the attack and collapsed. The enemy then began its artillery bombardment, concentrating its fire on the fortifications built by our troops, but the damage was minimal. Our original front line remained firmly defended. Throughout yesterday, apart from artillery battles between the two sides, the entire line temporarily became quiet. Our troops advanced under artillery fire and have recaptured villages such as Shengjiazhai and Xiaomiao in Bao'an Township.

### More Than Ten Enemy Ships Gather at Liuhang

Appearing to Be Planning a Landing

According to military intelligence, there are more than ten enemy ships concentrated in the river area from the Liuhangkou to Maqiaokou, including one capital ship, appearing to be planning a landing. Our side has taken strict precautions.

### The Enemy Plants Landmines in Yangmu Bridge

Eight Tanks Destroyed, Half of Them; More Than One Hundred Enemy Soldiers Killed Miserably

The battles in the Liuhang area have been relatively fierce in recent days. Although the enemy has tried its best to attack, it has been defeated by our forces. Yesterday, after a new rain cleared up, the enemy attacked us again. First, they used eight tanks to cover several hundred of their infantry, and once again charged towards Yangmu Bridge. However, after our great victory, our troops knew that the enemy would definitely attack again, so they secretly laid a minefield at the end of the bridge late that night. When the tanks and infantry charged forward together, they were suddenly ambushed and exploded, and the sound shook the sky. Half of the eight tanks were destroyed, and the other four were also significantly damaged. More than one hundred enemy infantry soldiers were killed instantly by the mines. Our troops immediately launched an attack, and the enemy, despite suffering heavy casualties, still resisted stubbornly, but was finally defeated by our forces. The four remaining damaged enemy tanks were taken back by the enemy.

### Artillery Shells Rained Down on Zhabei All Day

Enemy Artillery Bombarded Our Baoshan Road; An Attempt to Attack Baziqiao Was Repelled By Us

According to the Central News Agency, the situation on the Zhabei and Jiangwan lines yesterday was as follows, according to front-line reports: (1) Yesterday morning, about one company of the enemy attacked our positions along the line of Tiyuhui Road, Shuidian Road, and Chih Chih University. Our defending soldiers calmly responded to the attack and fought several times, and the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and retreated. (2) On the Baziqiao front, at about 2:00 PM yesterday, the enemy fired artillery shells to attack our positions, covering about one company of enemy troops who were attempting to probe our警戒綫. Our defending soldiers calmly responded to the attack, and the enemy did not retreat until 4:00 PM.

According to the Central News Agency, at 5:30 AM yesterday morning, enemy aircraft circled and scouted our positions in the Zhabei area. Starting at 9:00 AM, they fired artillery shells intermittently to bombard our positions along Baoshan Road. The sound of artillery fire was particularly dense from 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM, causing several civilian houses to be destroyed. At 4:00 PM, the sound of artillery fire gradually stopped. At the same time, enemy aircraft circled and scouted, and fired machine guns, but we suffered no damage. At 6:00 PM, the sound of artillery fire started again, seemingly as a precaution, to prevent us from attacking.

### Enemy Aircraft Again Carry Out Wanton Bombing Yesterday

Randomly Dropping Bombs and Firing Machine Guns, Causing Little Damage; Covering the Construction of Artillery Positions in Luodian

Pudong

When the reporter arrived at the Bund at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the first batch of enemy aircraft consisted of ten planes, divided into three teams, with one plane flying alone. Under the reconnaissance of the planes flying at high altitude over Pudong, four bombs were dropped, but only black smoke was seen, and they did not ignite. After dropping these few bombs, they changed to two planes flying together, and did not dare to fly low. They generally flew slowly in the airspace of six to seven thousand feet, circling and scouting various parts of Pudong from the Lujiazui Muddy Beach to the Xinkai River. This lasted for about an hour. Our garrison ignored them because they were just throwing bombs randomly. At 4:46 PM, another nine enemy aircraft, divided into three teams, flew from Yangshupu to Pudong. The nine planes gathered near the Jardine Matheson & Co. Wharf to scout. At about 5:20 PM, having found nothing, they randomly dropped a few bombs and left.

At 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, five enemy aircraft flew over the Pudong sky and dropped two bombs. Later, the number increased to thirteen, and they alternately approached and separated, carrying out heavy bombing, dropping no less than twenty bombs. Fortunately, most of the residents in the area had already evacuated, so only many civilian houses were destroyed, and there was not much damage.

Zhabei

After several days of continuous rain and low air pressure, enemy aircraft had not dared to carry out their atrocities in our Zhabei positions for several days. Yesterday, the weather cleared up, and the autumn sun shone brightly. Three enemy aircraft, at about 7:00 AM in the morning, again circled and scouted over Zhabei, and dropped bombs extensively. Their bombing was aimless, and they did not fly low. They dropped bombs from an altitude of about 5,000 meters, sometimes with three planes dropping bombs at the same time, so the sound was like a huge thunder, which could be heard far and wide. However, their target was unknown, so there was no damage.

Nanshi

Enemy aircraft circled over Nanshi yesterday. From 7:30 AM to 10:00 AM, there were a total of seven enemy aircraft, one leading and six divided into two teams, flying over the area of the Train Station Road Local Court. Their altitude was almost the same as the roof of a three-story building, and they circled the entire southern district of Shanghai. They dropped one bomb at Nanhuangpu and other places, which did not explode, and their machine guns kept firing. At 2:00 PM, three enemy aircraft appeared in the sky again, circled for a long time, and suddenly flew to the southwest. Then they flew back and, at about 4:00 PM, crossed the Huangpu River and returned along Pudong. The public, under the guidance of the police, has become very strict about air defense, so there is gradually less fear.

Luodian

According to the Central News Agency, enemy aircraft had not been active for two days. Yesterday morning, they appeared again over Douchang and Luodian, carrying out bombing. It is understood that the enemy aircraft's bombing was only to cover the construction of their artillery positions near Luodian.

### Enemy Forces Japanese Nationals Women and Children to Return Home

Strong Men Are Forced to Serve in Shanghai, Creating Resentment and Separation of Families

According to the East China News Agency, refugees who have just escaped from Yangshupu say that recently, the enemy's army and navy have forced Japanese women and children to return home. The ships they are using are military ships transporting enemy military supplies, separating them from their fathers and brothers. All Japanese nationals in Shanghai who are strong men are sent to the military to serve as reserves, guides, or to transport supplies, forcing them to abandon their wives and children and do cruel work against their conscience. The women and children returning to Japan are on the same ship as the ashes of those who have died on the battlefield, which adds to their grief. Therefore, when they leave Shanghai, their faces are full of tears and resentment. The Japanese people's hatred of the Japanese military is another proof of this.

### Tokyo Recruits Volunteer Officers

According to the Central News Agency, the enemy has launched a large-scale invasion of our Pingjin and Shanghai. After our brave resistance, the enemy has suffered heavy losses, and many middle and lower-ranking officers have been sacrificed. As a result of repeated recruitment of reinforcements, the original army officers are no longer sufficient for deployment. According to news from Tokyo, they have now begun to recruit volunteer officers. The first recruitment is for 100 infantry officers, which will close at the end of this month. Those with experience as active-duty officers or in their respective military branches are eligible. After training, they will be employed from December.

### Number of Deaths From Cholera Among the Enemy

Several Hundred Enemy Soldiers Have Died of Illness in Baoshan County; More Than Eight Hundred Enemy Soldiers Have Died Near Shanghai

According to a quick news report from this city on the 24th, a Japanese military spokesperson said that 200 Japanese soldiers in the Baoshan County area have died of cholera, and 300 more are currently suffering from the disease. However, according to private sources, approximately 800 Japanese soldiers in the Shanghai area have died of cholera in the past three weeks.

### Two Cases of Stray Bullet Injuries This Morning

### The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees Subscribes to 300,000 Yuan of National Salvation Bonds

The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees has now decided to subscribe to 300,000 yuan of National Salvation Bonds. According to the person in charge of the Board, the Boxer Indemnity funds managed by the Board are used to allocate loans for productive undertakings such as railways and water conservancy, and the interest income is used to supplement various educational and cultural institutions. There are no other funds that can be used. However, during this time of national crisis, the Chinese and British directors are all enthusiastic about assisting the government in actively resisting the enemy. They have specifically agreed to withdraw half of the preparatory funds for sending students abroad and other self-run undertakings to subscribe to the bonds, in order to promote this cause.

### Enemy Planes Attacked Nanjing Five Times Yesterday

A total of ninety-six aircraft　Dropped more than two hundred bombs　Our air force shot down five　Central News Agency　Central Broadcasting Station was destroyed

[Nanjing] Ninety-six enemy planes attacked Nanjing five times from 9:30 AM to 4:30 PM on the 25th. The first wave consisted of thirty-one planes, the second of thirty-two, the third of six, the fourth of twelve, and the fifth of fifteen. Only a small portion managed to penetrate the skies above Nanjing. When the first wave attacked, our air force immediately scrambled to intercept, resulting in fierce aerial combat over the outskirts of Nanjing. Although most of the enemy planes were repelled, a dozen or so still managed to penetrate Nanjing's airspace. Our anti-aircraft guns and artillery opened fire on the enemy planes, who still risked dropping bombs in various locations and strafing downward with machine guns. Explosions and gunfire erupted simultaneously, shaking the entire city. The Xiaguan Power Plant was bombed, and its machinery was slightly damaged. The alert was lifted at 10:30 AM. In this engagement, five enemy planes were shot down by our forces, mostly by anti-aircraft fire. One fighter plane crashed inside the courtyard of No. 27 Wangfu Garden in the south of the city. Two heavy bombers crashed in Xiaguan and caught fire and were completely destroyed. Two other planes were damaged and attempted to flee, one crashing and burning in Taixing, and the crash site of the other is still under investigation. The above describes the first attack. The second attack came at 12:30 PM at noon. Three bombs were dropped on the headquarters of the Central News Agency on Hongwu Road, completely destroying the building, injuring three workers. The Central Broadcasting Station outside Jiangdongmen was also bombed, and its equipment was destroyed. The alert was lifted at 1:20 PM. The third, fourth, and fifth attacks were shorter in duration because our air force interception and the fierce bombardment by air defense units resulted in fewer enemy planes penetrating than in the first two attacks. The targets of the enemy planes' multiple bombings on the 25th, in addition to the aforementioned Capital Power Plant, Central News Agency Headquarters, and Central Broadcasting Station, included the vicinity of the Ministry of Health's Central Hospital, a branch of the Sipaulou Health Office, Guangdong Hospital, and other charitable institutions. Among the shops and civilian houses destroyed were many buildings along Zhongshan Motor Company, Santiao Lane, Jiangdongmen, Jiankang Road, and the Bianying area of Mentung. Regarding the number of casualties, one person died and five were injured at the Health Affairs Branch, three died and six were injured at Guangdong Hospital, six died and more than ten were injured at Jiangdongmen, more than ten died and more than twenty were injured in Santiao Lane, and eight died and more than ten were injured at Bianying. The detailed figures are not yet available due to the late hour. The total number of bombs dropped by enemy planes on the 25th was over two hundred. The targets of the bombing were mostly cultural and health institutions and civilian residences. The dead and wounded were all civilians. The cruel and savage bestiality of the enemy troops was fully exposed, their disregard for humanity and violation of international law making them a public enemy of all mankind. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)

[Nanjing] The Central Broadcasting Station (XO&A) built by the Central Broadcasting Administration, located in Jiangdongmen in the western suburbs of Nanjing, had a power of 75 kilowatts. During the enemy air raid on the 25th, its equipment was destroyed. It is now reported that the newly built Jinling Broadcasting Station of the department, callsign (ZGX), will begin broadcasting today, using the same wavelength of 660 kilocycles. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)

[Zhenjiang] This area was under air raid alert all day on the 25th. No less than a hundred enemy planes passed through here on their way to Nanjing. They all flew at an altitude of over 5,000 feet. At around 5 PM, as the enemy planes were fleeing back from Nanjing, they encountered one of our transport ships on the Jiangzhu estuary at Twelve Forts. They suddenly flew low and dropped a bomb, which missed. Our ship opened fire, and the enemy plane escaped. (Special dispatch on the 25th)

[Nanjing] Ignoring the protests of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, the Japanese military authorities dispatched twenty-nine aircraft again this morning to continue bombing Nanjing. As a result, the densely populated southern part of the city was targeted by enemy planes, which dropped many bombs. When the enemy planes approached, the anti-aircraft guns on the ground fired like a string of pearls, immediately shooting down three enemy planes. One of them caught fire and exploded in mid-air, one crashed in the southern part of the city, and one crashed in the northern district. The first air raid warning was issued at 9:02 AM. Ten minutes later, ten Chinese fighter planes took off to prepare for battle. The second warning was issued at 9:37 AM. Eighteen minutes later, fourteen Japanese planes were seen appearing in the Nanjing sky, approaching in a single file from the south, like a black dragon. After the Japanese planes reached the airspace above the southern part of the city, they swooped down to drop bombs. At that moment, one plane was hit by an extremely accurate anti-aircraft gun from the Chinese side and immediately caught fire, exploding into fragments in the air. The spectators on the ground temporarily forgot their dangerous situation and cheered and applauded to express their joy. The other enemy planes hurriedly dropped their bombs and then soared high into the clouds to hide. However, the trajectory of the anti-aircraft gun explosions in the air could still be used to discern the direction of the enemy planes' escape. But at this moment, another squadron of Japanese planes attacked, consisting of eleven bombers and four fighter planes, which flew in from the south along the original route to bomb the southern part of the city. Five minutes later, Chinese anti-aircraft guns hit another bomber, which crashed in the northern district. The other planes, seeing the situation was unfavorable, fled towards Xiaguan. The manager of Texaco, a Dane named Hansen, witnessed the entire aerial battle from a small hill next to the American Embassy. He said, "After the Japanese planes swooped down to drop bombs in the southern part of the city, the anti-aircraft guns fired upwards, with accuracy that could be described as unmatched. One shot hit one plane. I personally witnessed the plane that was hit, along with the undropped bombs inside, explode in mid-air, turning into thick smoke and flames that fell to the ground. In addition, one plane was also hit in Xiaguan during the second attack and exploded and crashed in the air. As for where the bombs fell, both the southern part of the city and Xiaguan were hit, but the area west of Zhongshan Road was not attacked." (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 25th)

[Nanjing] After the Japanese planes attacked twice this morning, an alarm was raised again at noon. At 12:50 PM, twenty-one enemy planes flew in from the east and dropped bombs densely. Some fell near the broadcasting station. The bomb explosions were very loud, and the doors and windows of the American Embassy were shaken. American Ambassador Johnson and his staff continued to work as usual. Six bombs fell in the central district of the city. There were reports that bombs also fell near the Customs Office of the Ministry of Finance. Foreigners who witnessed the events saw huge craters formed by the explosions, but no houses were seen to be damaged. When residents, believing the danger had passed, were leaving their shelters to have lunch, a large squadron of enemy planes flew in from the southeast and dropped many bombs near the waterworks and broadcasting station. It was 2:00 PM. This morning, two bombs fell near the Taikoo Dock in Xiaguan, and one bomb hit the building of the Jardine Matheson Timber Company, but there were no deaths or injuries in either location. The impact of the Japanese planes' attacks was merely to disrupt the residents' daily lives. The attacks today were clearly aimed at the waterworks and power plant. Although both suffered damage, the authorities are working hard to repair them so that they can be restored to their original state as soon as possible. A group of American photographers at the Yangtze River Hotel, about a hundred yards from the power plant, had a good opportunity today to film the enemy planes dropping and exploding bombs one by one, for a total of ten minutes. Six bombs fell within five hundred yards of the Reuters office. The building and the bomb shelter in the front yard both felt significant tremors. Three bombs exploded at the headquarters of the Central News Agency in T'usze Road, injuring three employees, two with minor injuries and one more seriously. The number of deaths and injuries today has not yet been determined. It is now believed that about a hundred civilians were killed or injured. According to an official from the Air Force Command, four enemy planes were shot down today, two crashing in Xiaguan, one in the southern part of the city, and one outside the South Gate. The shooting down of three planes was witnessed by people. Three fires broke out in the Zhongshan Road area of the southern part of the city due to the bombing, where many shops were located. The shooting down of enemy planes this morning was entirely due to the power of the anti-aircraft guns. The accuracy of the anti-aircraft guns was unexpectedly good.

[Nanjing] Enemy planes attacked Nanjing twice on the morning of the 25th. During the second attack at 12:30 PM, three bombs were dropped on the headquarters of the Central News Agency at 12:40 PM, completely destroying the building and injuring five people. It has been confirmed that the Central News Agency is purely a cultural organization, and its location is in a densely populated area. The enemy planes' indiscriminate bombing is truly abhorrent to humanity. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)

(Local news) Enemy planes flew to Nanjing and wreaked havoc yesterday, and five were shot down by our forces. According to the Allied News Agency, one of those killed was the enemy plane squadron leader, named Sakamoto. (Central News Agency)

The Central News Agency issued a circular stating: To all newspapers and readers everywhere, please note that our agency was subjected to enemy bombing this afternoon, with three bombs dropped, completely destroying the building and injuring several employees. This has caused obstacles to our work, resulting in slight delays in the release of news. We sincerely apologize. The enemy's barbaric act of wantonly bombing our cultural institutions has long been condemned by both Chinese and foreign countries. During this time of all-out resistance, our agency has also been destroyed, which we had long anticipated. Therefore, we had made some preparations elsewhere in advance. Although we have suffered this serious blow, we can still continue to supply news, which is sufficient to comfort the fervent hopes of the people of the country. As long as we have a breath of life, we will vow to follow our original intention, follow the lead of our colleagues across the country, and actively fight for national survival and the cause of peaceful culture. Respectfully, the Central News Agency Headquarters.

### Guangdong Again Suffers Air Raids

Our Air Force Intercepts and Repels Enemy　Enemy Ships Also Shell Haikou

[Hong Kong] Enemy planes attacked Guangzhou at 0:30 AM on the 25th and were repelled by our planes in the suburbs. Three planes came again at 4:00 AM, but only one entered the city and dropped three bombs in Shou Gou Hill. At 11:00 AM, three planes came again from the Tangjiawan sea and attacked. They were intercepted by our planes in Whampoa, and two were damaged and escaped. (Special dispatch on the 25th)

[Hong Kong] The movements of the enemy aircraft carriers in the Pearl River Estuary are extremely secret, changing several times a day. Two enemy aircraft carriers, two destroyers, and one patrol ship are stationed in the rocky sea forty miles from Hong Kong. Two enemy ships arrived at the islands of Da Chuan and Xiao Chuan near Hai Pao, Taishan County, on the 22nd to survey the waterways, seemingly intending to land troops. We are on high alert. Many residents of Hai Pao have come to Hong Kong to take refuge. (Special dispatch on the 25th)

[Hong Kong] At noon on the 25th, an enemy plane sneaked into the city and dropped a bomb. (Special dispatch on the 25th)

[Guangzhou] At 10:50 AM on the 25th, a squadron of enemy planes attacked Guangzhou. Our air force sent planes to intercept them in the sky near Humen. After a fierce battle lasting about twenty minutes, the enemy planes were overwhelmed and fled while fighting. They dropped several bombs near Humen, falling on the ocean and fields. One enemy plane still wanted to break into the city's airspace, but was relentlessly pursued by our planes and ultimately failed to reach the city's airspace. (Central Dispatch on the 25th)

[Guangzhou] At 10:00 AM on the 24th, two Japanese planes first flew in from the north and circled over the city of Haikou, reaching heights of over ten thousand feet, and dropped leaflets and many copies of the Taiwan New People's News, which mostly claimed enemy victories. Our defending troops did not fire on them because they were flying too high. Later, one plane flew to the western coast and scouted for a long time. At noon, an enemy ship suddenly sailed into port and opened fire on the shore. The enemy planes soared in the sky to indicate the target, but were afraid of being hit by our anti-aircraft guns and did not dare to fly low, dropping only a few bombs, all of which fell in the fields. Under the joint sea and air attack of the enemy, the defending troops of our artillery positions bravely returned fire and fought back fiercely. The sound of artillery rumbled for about an hour before the enemy ships and planes were repelled. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)

[Guangzhou] At 11:25 PM on the 24th, an enemy plane sneaked into the airspace over Guangzhou and circled for about two hours without dropping any bombs before leaving. At 2:15 AM, another enemy plane returned to spy on the city, hovering at high altitude. After close surveillance by our air defense forces, the enemy plane did not drop any bombs and flew to the southeast at around 4:00 AM. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)

[Guangzhou] Houses collapsed in Guangzhou due to the bombing by enemy planes for several days. Tsang Yang-fu personally inspected the situation on the 23rd and 24th, and consoled the families of the dead and injured. He also sent personnel to visit the victims who were being treated in the hospital to express his concern. He expressed his utmost hatred for the brutal and inhumane Japanese militarists. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)

[Guangzhou] It is reported that when enemy planes raided Guangzhou at night, traitors used rockets near the residences of German expatriates in the urban area as signals to aid the enemy. German Deputy Consul Dr. Kempe explained to the military and political authorities that this matter could easily cause misunderstandings and requested that it be strictly prohibited. He also expressed that the friendship between the German expatriates and the Chinese nation has not diminished in the slightest, and that they considered the traitors to be their personal enemies as well. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)

[Guangzhou] At 7:00 AM this morning, a Japanese patrol ship and two planes bombed Haikou, the main port of Hainan Island. The patrol ship fired a total of twenty-one shots. Details of the damage are unknown. This morning, several Japanese planes attempted to bomb the Chinese small patrol boat at Ximenkou in Macau, but missed the target and destroyed many Chinese houses by the river, killing many people. The air raid alarm was issued in Guangzhou this morning probably because of this. In fact, the Japanese planes were not discovered in the Guangzhou sky at that time. At 1:10 PM, Japanese planes bombed many villages near the Humen fortresses. The number of deaths and injuries is not yet known, but it is feared that many people in rural areas have suffered. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 25th)

### Tragic Scenes of Wuhan Bombing

Slums Become Fields of Rubble　Corpses Littered Everywhere, Rescue Overwhelmed

[Hankou] Enemy planes killed 511 people in Hankou on the 24th, with 22 dying in hospitals, 194 seriously injured, and 270 slightly injured. In Hanyang, 129 died, 156 were seriously injured, and 194 were slightly injured. In Wuchang, 2 died and 1 was injured. In total, 1,019 people were killed or injured. Aftercare is being rushed. (Special dispatch on the 25th)

[Hankou] The slum of Wu Jing Miao in Hankou, which was bombed yesterday, is even more desolate after another visit by Japanese bombers last night. Thousands of terrified and homeless women are scattered in the streets. Rescue workers, already exhausted, are still digging bodies from the rubble, some of whom are not dead, but are so severely injured and dismembered that they would rather be dead. A Reuters reporter saw a Chinese child, about ten years old, carrying his mother's corpse on his shoulders and placing it in front of the gatekeeper of the hospital, asking him to bury it. He then went to look for his missing younger siblings. The Reuters reporter then went to a small house and looked inside, seeing three men sitting upright as if alive. Upon closer inspection, they were all corpses, one of whom was still holding a dead child in his arms. The reporter also saw multiple corpses in one room of another house, while in another room, a woman was calmly preparing a meal, as if nothing had happened. However, it was reported that Chinese fighters shot down a Japanese plane 40 kilometers from Hankou yesterday. It is estimated that the Japanese planes flew at an altitude of about 2,000 feet yesterday. According to foreign experts, the Japanese planes must have been able to see the dense population of Wu Jing Miao and the absence of military targets. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 25th)

[Hankou] After experiencing the horror of death and destruction during yesterday afternoon's bombing, Japanese planes returned to Hankou last night and dropped more bombs. Last night's bombing lasted only ten minutes, but the destruction was very severe. All the doctors, paramedics, and nurses in Wuhan have now been urged by the authorities to serve, and the pain of the dead and wounded has been greatly reduced by the efforts of the Chinese Red Cross and the Methodist Hospital to provide relief and treatment. Due to insufficient electricity, most surgeries and amputations are performed by candlelight. The seriously injured have to be injected with morphine to reduce their pain. This morning, a section of land about two hundred feet long and five feet wide was found to have been completely destroyed by three direct hits. Relief work is still underway, and the rubble is being searched for corpses. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)

[Hankou] After Japanese planes turned the slum area of Hankou into a field of rubble last night, a Reuters reporter went to inspect the disaster area. What he saw was a scene of extreme tragedy. The streets of the Wu Jing Miao (transliteration) district, only six feet wide, were lined with the homes of the poor, but now they are all rubble. Those who lived there and those who walked along the roads were buried in them. Limbs were scattered everywhere. Rescue teams were collecting and piling them up. Even more tragic, broken walls and ruined walls often had an arm or a leg hanging from them, which was chilling to see. The reporter stood on the side of the road for about ten minutes and saw more than one hundred and twenty heavily injured people carried past, some moaning in agony, and others already lifeless. Most heartbreaking was the ambulance full of injured and dead infants. The disaster area was filled with a mixture of dead and half-dead people, with most of the injured naked and bleeding from their wounds. There seemed to be more corpses of young children than adults, probably because the young children were mostly indoors when the Japanese planes wreaked havoc. Police, students, and business groups are working hard under extremely difficult conditions, digging out the injured from the rubble, and moving the corpses whenever they are found. Many students are still working on their tragic work late into the night, showing signs of fatigue, but not resting at all. The mayor and other important figures personally went to the scene to direct the relief efforts, and the order was well maintained. The fire of the power lines made the rescue more difficult. Although doctors and rescue workers were working non-stop, their numbers were too small, which was a major regret. The original population of Wu Jing Miao was 10,000, and there were no troops within several miles, while the military factory, which was clearly the target of the Japanese bombing, was at least four miles away. In addition to Hankou, Hanyang and Wuchang were also attacked. A bomb fell in Hanyang and hit a refugee camp, killing sixty people and injuring many others. Hundreds of injured people in the Hankou Church Hospital were almost destroyed by bombs. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 25th)

When our garrison approached the shore, they opened fire with machine guns. The enemy, knowing that our defenses were very tight, fled immediately, but the enemy ships remained in place. Two warships have been discovered outside Luobo Port in Fukou, and this morning they have sailed downstream. However, a giant ship was discovered in the center of the river. After being inspected with a telescope, it appeared to be armored, but due to the heavy fog, it was difficult to confirm. (Special dispatch on the 25th)

### Japanese Youth and Students' Anti-War Movement Intensifies

Student Federation Has Eight Million Members　Questions Reasons for Invasion of China

According to a certain evening paper, a foreigner who recently arrived in Shanghai from Tokyo stated that anti-war sentiment within Japan has been gradually rising. In particular, young students are leading the anti-war movement. This is a good sign that the Japanese people are gradually realizing that military force is not enough to conquer China. However, Japanese police authorities strictly prohibit the leakage of such information, making it difficult to investigate. What is currently known is that the central organization of the Japanese youth anti-war movement is comprised of university and high school students within Japan. Their student federation has a total of eight million members. Recently, they elected representatives to question the Tokyo government about the reasons for invading China. At that time, government officials were dispatched to respond, stating that the war against China was due to hundreds of Imperial Army soldiers stationed in China being killed by Chinese troops. Therefore, the government, to maintain Japan's dignity, must launch a large-scale offensive to force the Chinese army to submit. The student representatives were greatly dissatisfied with this response and immediately continued to question, saying that the Japanese army's casualties were only a few hundred, but now, abandoning all other avenues, hundreds of thousands of troops are being mobilized into dangerous territory. Is it truly necessary to send hundreds of thousands of people into danger because of the deaths of only a few hundred? The government representatives were unable to answer, and the meeting ended unhappily. However, the government already knows that young students are mostly clear-headed and cannot be motivated by war, nor can they be forced to be in the vanguard of combat. Therefore, recent conscription within the country has focused on middle-aged merchants. The method of conscription is implemented by the police using semi-coercive means, so small and medium-sized merchants are currently very panicked. In addition, trade with China has always been the only major customer for Japanese merchants. Since the start of the invasion of China, Japanese goods have been piling up like mountains, making it difficult to sell them off quickly. Therefore, the number of businesses collapsing as a result is increasing daily.

### Overseas Chinese in Japan Returning Home Successively

[Xiamen] The British ship "Dilitihua" arrived in Xiamen on the 25th, carrying 1,400 overseas Chinese from Tokyo, Nagasaki, and Taiwan. According to overseas Chinese returning from Taiwan, Taiwan was originally still peaceful, but recently, 200,000 young Taiwanese men were forcibly conscripted into the military and sent to China to fight. The Taiwanese people were unwilling, businesses stopped, and farmers stopped farming, causing great chaos. There are still 40,000 overseas Chinese in Taiwan who are suffering from abuse. There are few ships, making it difficult to return. (25th Special Dispatch)

### City Relief Association Invited Mei Lanfang to Broadcast Yesterday

The Theatrical World Initiated It Voluntarily Zhou Xinfang and Others Participated

The Shanghai City Relief Association is housing no less than 30,000 refugees. As the war expands, more and more arrive one after another. As the weather gradually cools, the refugees need cotton clothing. At the same time, the cost of supplies is also substantial. A fundraising broadcast was previously held, with excellent results. Yesterday, the Theatrical Association once again initiated a fundraising drive, inviting Dr. Mei Lanfang and other famous actors such as Zhou Xinfang to broadcast special, wonderful programs on the city's Fuxing Radio Station to raise relief funds. The Relief Association specially sent Xu Caicheng, the director of the reception group, to oversee the collection of donations. It is reported that the broadcast raised over ten thousand yuan in donations. The detailed amount and the titles of the donors will be announced at the end. In addition, the association plans to hire photographers to take systematic photos of all its relief work, in order to expose to the world the suffering of the Chinese people caused by enemy invasion and to arouse sympathy.

### Enemy Planes Bomb Civilian Residential Areas, Causing Deep Impression of Pain Throughout England

Daventry Radio Station Exceptionally Suspended Broadcasting　Terror in the Sky Arouses People's Hatred and Common Cause

The "China Press" reports that those in this city who listened to the British Daventry radio broadcast on the evening of September 23 were deeply moved. After reading the latest news of the tragic deaths and injuries caused by Japanese aircraft attacks on Guangzhou and Nanjing, the announcer paused and expressed his opinion, saying that listeners everywhere should feel the deepest sympathy for the families of the victims. All who know that British broadcasting procedures have always been conservative feel that this unprecedented action by the radio station is very meaningful. The detailed reports of the orderly bombing of Chinese cities by the Japanese air force must have caused a deep impression of pain in the hearts of the British people, especially since everyone recognizes that China has very few ways to retaliate against this bombing. Nanjing has prepared new-style anti-aircraft artillery teams and has also set up bomb shelters for civilians, arranging them very completely, which has reduced the damage. However, the number of casualties in that area is still large. As for Guangzhou, the rural population is larger than elsewhere. Apart from anti-aircraft artillery and defensive aircraft, no preparations have been made to protect civilians, so the tragedy of deaths and injuries is beyond description. According to travelers, many villages between Nanjing and Shanghai have been completely destroyed by aircraft, and Suzhou is now also encountering this kind of tragedy. The Japanese military's intention is to intimidate the people and prevent them from giving the government the united support necessary to continue the war of resistance. However, judging from the current situation, the terror in the sky has only strengthened the people's overall hatred of the enemy, which is not without clear evidence. It is now believed that the Japanese aircraft dropped a total of thirty tons of bombs during their recent attack on the capital. It is said that Japanese aircraft can drop fifty tons of bombs every day and for a long time. Thinking about the future seems frightening, but it is still questionable whether the Japanese aircraft can truly achieve their goals. If they ultimately fail to achieve them, then an even more serious question will arise: 'What will Japan do then?'

The "China Press" reports that Niu Men, an accountant for Jardine Matheson's steamship company on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, arrived in Shanghai by train from the capital yesterday. According to an interview with a "China Press" reporter, he arrived in Nanjing from Jiujiang at noon on the 20th. He witnessed the Japanese aircraft attack at Xiaguan and saw two bombs falling on Tiger Hill, missing their target. The enemy planes flew southwest of the city and dropped bombs. The enemy planes flew very high, about 10,000 feet above the ground, and seemed to focus on civilian residential areas, with military installations taking second place, obviously trying to avoid retaliation from the city's defense forces. The enemy planes flew very high, so it was difficult for China's anti-aircraft artillery to hit them. The bombs exploded about 6,000 feet above the ground, so the enemy planes still had room to maneuver. Chinese warships, the Tiger Hill fort, and various locations in the city fired many shots. In his view, the air defense of the capital was extremely complete, and there were also a large number of fighter planes. He saw many Chinese soldiers along the way, and their morale was very high. They were not slightly affected by the Japanese aircraft attacks. They were on the grass on the train station platform, not at all alarmed, all calmly holding their guns and waiting for orders. The Japanese aircraft's air raids seemed to only increase the soldiers' hatred of the enemy.

Current Commentary

### Re-Examining Wartime Finance

— Zhang Naiqi

"Finance is the lifeblood of the nation. It is not the private property of anyone. Financial institutions are the heart of the nation. They are not anyone's shops." This is something I have said before.

Based on this principle, I have requested that peacetime finance should consider the balance of international payments and national income, and not solely the profits and losses of the financial sector.

I now further request that wartime finance should not only consider the balance of international payments and national income, but also strengthen national power and cultivate the strength of the people.

Financial institutions are the center of the entire economic structure. The power of finance should be the leader of all economic activities. If finance tightens on one industry, that industry will often decline. If finance expands in one area, that area will often prosper. For example, if financial institutions had not expanded cotton mortgage lending in the past two years, there would not be an oversupply of cotton production this year. Furthermore, if financial institutions had been able to tighten on the metal industry in Shanghai and expand on the metal industry in Nanjing in the past two years, some of the metal industry's inventory could have been moved to Nanjing. We can benefit immensely simply by skillfully using expansion and contraction.

It is precisely by relying on this skillful use that finance can consider the nation's revenue and expenditure. Let me give an example to prove it. Two years ago, three Chinese shipping companies, unable to withstand the competition from three foreign shipping companies on the Yangtze River, entered into a business agreement with them. At that time, if our financial institutions had been able to provide the Chinese shipping companies with 50 million yuan in working capital, allowing them to continue competing, then when the Chinese shipping companies later lost 50 million yuan, the foreign shipping companies might have also lost 50 million yuan. As a result, although the financial institutions would have to eat 50 million yuan in bad debts, the foreign companies would have remitted 50 million yuan less in investment income from China. We would have gained 50 million yuan in our balance of international payments. Therefore, if you are thinking like a small shopkeeper, this cannot be done. But if you are thinking like a nation, this should be done.

How can we consider national income? If financial institutions lend 1 million yuan to foreign merchants to import a batch of consumables, foreign manufacturers will earn 100,000 yuan in profits from that. As a result, we increase the national income of others while decreasing our own national income. If we lend this 1 million yuan to Chinese manufacturers, allowing them to mobilize 10,000 people for production and earn 100,000 yuan in profits, we increase our own national income. We lend 100 yuan to mobilize a non-productive person to produce. As long as they can produce 101 yuan worth of value, the extra one yuan is national income.

Speaking of wartime finance, the task is naturally even higher. In peacetime, we can still think in terms of monetary figures, so we must consider the balance of international payments and national income. In wartime, we simply cannot think solely in terms of monetary figures, but must first consider the word "power." In peacetime, money can be turned into "power," but in wartime, money cannot necessarily be turned into "power." The coastal blockade is a problem. Distant water cannot quench a nearby fire is also a problem.

In order to put the word "power" first, wartime finance should, in terms of production, adhere to the principles of self-sufficiency, self-supply, and self-defense, accelerating the enrichment of national power and not simply calculating costs or profits. For example, we know that it is more cost-effective to import a certain commodity than to produce it ourselves. However, for the needs of national defense, we have no choice but to bite the bullet and encourage everyone to produce it. Like Germany, which uses extremely high costs to produce artificial rubber and coal-derived gasoline, we should emulate this in the sense of self-defense. Furthermore, some equipment is known to have no productive value. However, for the needs of national defense, we have no choice but to encourage everyone to equip it. Such as air defense facilities in various cities, whether public or private. As long as they can guarantee national power, we should accommodate funds and encourage everyone to do it, and we can no longer care about the productivity and security of this investment. It is absolutely impossible to fight a fire while calculating the cost of water, treat a disease while calculating the cost of medicine, and use a normal mindset to deal with an extraordinary period.

Secondly, in order to put the word "power" first, wartime finance should, in terms of manpower, adhere to the principle of "making every able-bodied man in the country worthy of being an able-bodied man" (see my article "On Wartime Finance" in this column on the 7th of this month), making the cultivation of the people's strength the main task and not simply calculating national income. In peacetime, lending 100 yuan to mobilize a person requires at least the hope that they will produce 101 yuan worth of value. In wartime, we would bite the bullet and do it even if they can only produce 98 yuan worth of value. The reason is to enable this person to support themselves, train themselves, and become a useful person in production. Although this is a loss in monetary figures, it is a gain in terms of cultivating the strength of the people, which is more meaningful than passive relief.

How can we implement this wartime finance principle? I still hope that everyone will put the entire national financial policy plan first, and not the issue of chips first. Because no one currently opposes increasing chips. The problem is only how to increase them in a way that passively prevents malignant inflation and actively achieves the goal of strengthening national power and cultivating the strength of the people. When designing the plan, we should firmly remember the four words "national defense center" and not just see the rise and fall of one area or the interests of one industry.

For example, when talking about Shanghai, everyone naturally feels that the unemployment problem is very serious. But to solve the unemployment problem in Shanghai, the palliative solution is only to provide relief, and the fundamental solution is only to find a way in the interior. In the sense of national defense, it would be absolutely wrong and impossible to expand in Shanghai again to create a comprador-like, false prosperity to solve the unemployment problem. We can only tighten in Shanghai and expand in the interior, forcing many industrialists and businessmen to migrate to the interior. At the same time, with the financial circulation in the interior, it will be easier for the unemployed in Shanghai to solve their livelihood problems when they go to the interior.

When expanding to the interior, in terms of industry, we must naturally prioritize the restoration of factory production and mining operations, accelerate the promotion of handicrafts, and at the same time carry out the "industrialization of light industry by families" to accommodate a portion of the unemployed workers. Heavy industrial construction must naturally be done by finding ways to do it when there is no way to do it, to establish a foundation of self-sufficiency. In terms of agriculture, first, we should naturally pay attention to the collection of grain to consolidate national defense. Other mortgages can be done in moderation to maintain the livelihood of farmers. But the people who grow cotton will suffer a big loss this year, which is already a settled matter. We can only settle accounts with those who advocate Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. We must also strive to open up wasteland and increase arable land to accommodate another portion of the unemployed. In addition, we should also encourage cultural and educational undertakings in the interior as much as possible so that intellectuals and young people who go to the interior do not suffer from the depression of unemployment and schoollessness. This is our spiritual national defense, which cannot be neglected. Currently, domestic loans have gradually been promoted, and the relocation of cultural institutions has also begun to be implemented. Moreover, I have heard that the government will further adjust agricultural production and trade. I believe that more facts will be revealed in a short period of time to comfort the nation's hopes.

Finally, I hope that everyone will not be pessimistic about our wartime economy at all. I dare say that our wartime economy will be "the rising sun in the east" and the enemy's wartime economy will be "the sun setting in the west." As we take advantage of the war's opportunity, we can throw the comprador economy and the slave economy of peacetime into the vast ocean and stride into the path of a national economy. We have unlimited manpower to mobilize and unlimited resources to develop. As long as we use the now-invigorated people's hearts and mobilize the already-concentrated financial power to develop these unlimited resources, every day will be a better day. A step forward is a step towards brightness. And the enemy? Their peacetime economy has already reached its limits, forcing them to resort to an aggressive military speculation. Their resources are inherently scarce, and the conscription of able-bodied men will cause the production system to tend to collapse. The last signs of the collapse of their wartime economy, which is a mere flash in the pan, are already showing.

We must endure the current pain. This is the suffering that mothers should endure before and after infants are born on land. A great new era has already unfolded politically. Let us also usher in a great new era economically. We must stop the bleeding and strive forward. The final victory will surely be ours.

### Maintaining Great Power Prestige, US Attitude Becomes Tougher

Navy in China Decides Not to Withdraw　Duty-Bound, No Turning Back

[Washington] The US government's attitude toward the Sino-Japanese war has become tougher today. Although the State Department has not directly expressed support for China's request for assistance, its attitude has changed significantly based on the following two events: ㊀ The US Navy Department declared that its navy has decided to implement its policy of protecting overseas Chinese at all costs, and ㊁ The State Department lodged a serious protest with Tokyo on Wednesday against the Japanese bombing of cities and civilians. More importantly, when stating its position, the US Navy Department explicitly stated that the US Navy would not accept advice to withdraw from dangerous areas. However, the State Department's attitude toward the European countries' suggestion of invoking the Nine-Power Treaty to convene an international conference remains extremely lukewarm. (24th National Telegram)

[Washington] The US State Department announced today that the government has instructed the US Asian Fleet to remain in its current area and not withdraw, regardless of the stage of the Sino-Japanese war. If the US fleet were to withdraw from the Chinese coast at this time, it would greatly damage the US's prestige. However, if the US Navy adopts a policy of not withdrawing from the Chinese coast, it will inevitably suffer a great deal of danger. According to the State Department, "This kind of danger is of course unavoidable." Because the implementation of this policy is the obligation and great duty of the United States. (24th National Telegram)

### US Asian Fleet Commander Issues Proclamation by Radio

[Washington] According to the Navy Department's announcement today, as long as the Sino-Japanese war exists, the US Asian Fleet will remain in Chinese territorial waters. This announcement was made by Admiral Yarnell, commander of the Asian Fleet, after a meeting of the Naval Staff. It stated that the Navy's original policy of stationing warships in various ports where US overseas Chinese need protection will continue to exist even after the US overseas Chinese have been warned to leave China and given the opportunity to leave. Most US overseas Chinese currently remaining in China have businesses that support their livelihoods. Therefore, they are unwilling to give up lightly unless their businesses are destroyed or their bodies are harmed. Even at that time, the US Navy cannot withdraw and abandon its duty, affecting the honor of the US Navy. It is heard that the above order was broadcast to the Asian Fleet by Admiral Yarnell from the flagship "Augusta" stationed in Shanghai on the 22nd, and the code used was a clear code, intended to allow Japanese radio stations to receive it and not lose the true meaning of the US government.

### Japanese Planes Illegally Indiscriminate Bombings, England Lodges Another Protest to Japan

Violating Promises, Cruel, Inhuman　Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs' Reply Still Ambiguous　International Peace Groups Ask for Sanctions

[London] Regarding the bombing of non-military targets in various parts of China by Japanese aircraft, Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to Japan, was recently ordered to protest to the Tokyo government, stating that the British people were deeply outraged by the recent bombings of Nanjing and Guangzhou by Japanese aircraft, which resulted in the tragic deaths of a large number of civilians. In addition, Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen also explained to Foreign Minister Hirota that the reply submitted by Japan regarding the attack on Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen had provided assurances that it would respect the safety of ordinary people, but the recent bombing actions were completely contrary to this promise and should be brought to the attention of the Japanese government. The British protest has been sent to the US government for review. (Central News Agency 24th Havas)

[Tokyo] The Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs has replied to the British protest regarding the bombings of Nanjing and Guangzhou on Wednesday. It is reported that he stated to the British Ambassador to Japan that they would be extra cautious in the future. (Central News Agency 25th Reuters)

[London] Two hundred and fifty organizations related to the international peace movement received letters this morning from the British headquarters of this movement, requesting an immediate meeting to pass a resolution urging the British government to take action under the League of Nations to stop the cruel killing by Japanese aircraft in China. The British branch of the movement has appealed to the international headquarters to make the other forty-three countries take the same action. At the same time, it is heard that the Adelaide Trades and Labor Council, representing the trade unions of South Australia, has passed a resolution urging a boycott of Japanese goods and asking the Australian Council of Trade Unions to take the same action throughout Australia. A "Morning Post" correspondent in Calcutta, India, cabled that since Japanese merchant ships have been requisitioned by the government for military use, Indian shipping companies have seen a great development in their business and have made considerable profits. Japanese imports have also greatly decreased, and the prices of Japanese goods have therefore risen. Indian native products have therefore benefited greatly. (Central News Agency 25th Reuters)

### European and American Public Opinion in Uproar

Japanese Troops' Willful Slaughter Disgraces World Civilization

[Geneva] The repeated and indiscriminate bombing of our nation's capital by enemy aircraft has deeply shocked European public opinion. Major European newspapers have successively published photographs of innocent civilians tragically bombed by Japanese planes. Some newspapers have even denounced Japan as the "destroyer of 20th-century culture." Since the outbreak of this war, European sentiment and the attitude of various newspapers have been markedly different from 1932, especially among opposition newspapers in various countries. Since the Japanese bombing of Nanjing, they have gradually expressed dissatisfaction with Japan. For example, France's Le Matin and Le Journal, and Britain's Daily Mail and Morning Post. Some institutions with a strong sense of humanitarianism have also petitioned their governments to take effective measures or organize propaganda agencies to expose Japan's atrocities. For example, the International Federation of League of Nations Societies recently issued a declaration urging people to act according to their conscience, support China, and uphold international justice. International organizations in Geneva generally believe that each time Japan bombs innocent civilians, the world's opposition to Japan becomes more resolute. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)

[London] Regarding the Japanese aircraft's rampage and the bombing of innocent civilians, the Morning Post stated today that Britain's recent protest to Japan fully reflects humanity's widespread horror and disgust. For what is being endangered today is not only the lives, property, and interests of foreigners, but also the fundamental conditions of civilization. Regardless of the right or wrong of Japan's position in the Sino-Japanese War, the indiscriminate use of terror tactics will never gain world sympathy. We do not believe that this kind of brutality is endorsed or condoned by the majority of the Japanese people, for the Japanese nation's chivalry and human feelings are no less than those of the people of other countries. In reality, it seems that there is a small, powerful, and bellicose faction within the Japanese nation that has suddenly gone mad and cannot be restrained. We believe that if the Japanese people knew of this brutality being carried out in their name by these madmen, they would surely oppose it as much as outside critics do. What we hope for is that the Japanese people can understand this soon and immediately find a way to stop it, so that the nation's honor will not fall to an irreparable degree in the eyes of the world. Other newspapers of the Liberal and Labour parties continue to advocate economic sanctions against Japan. The News Chronicle stated, "Telegrams, telephone calls, and letters expressing disgust at Japan's slaughter of non-combatants have been constantly arriving at our office." The newspaper also advocated boycotting Japanese goods, saying, "Japan's economy depends entirely on the commercial goodwill of the world, so boycotting Japanese goods is the only way to awaken Tokyo." The Daily Herald stated, "The entire civilized world has yesterday unanimously and vehemently expressed its dismay at the Japanese air raids on Chinese cities and its contempt for those who issued the order. If economic sanctions are not implemented, the slaughter will never end." The newspaper further stated that economic pressure has become inevitable, and a meeting should be convened today to discuss how to implement it. The countries that should bear direct responsibility are Britain and the United States. The strength of these two countries is so great that they can stop the war without the participation of other countries. If Britain and the United States unite and do not buy Japanese cotton textiles and do not sell gasoline, iron, cotton, rubber, and machinery, it would be enough to make Japan yield. (Central News Agency dispatch from London, 25th)

[London] The National Club of the British Trades Union Congress recently sent an official letter to Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to Britain, stating, "The Japanese air force is wantonly bombing defenseless women and children in Guangzhou and other cities. This kind of destructive act of life is extremely heinous. Public opinion in all democratic and civilized countries deeply hates and detests it. We are also extremely indignant upon hearing the news. We hereby ask Your Excellency to convey our sincere condolences to your government and nation. Regarding this barbaric act of Japanese aircraft and the country's unprovoked war of aggression, we would be happy to participate if we can raise this protest in an effective manner. This letter has been sent to the Japanese Ambassador to Britain for his information," and so on. (Havas dispatch, 24th, Central News Agency)

[San Francisco] The California Church Council, representing 500,000 Christians today, telegraphed the New York Federation of Churches, lodging a serious protest against the inhumane bombing of defenseless Chinese civilians by Japanese militarists and the ruthless destruction of religious, cultural, and educational institutions.

### League of Nations Consultative Committee; Japan Refuses to Participate

Suggestion to Convene Far East Conference, Britain and France Express Support

[Geneva] Regarding the League of Nations General Assembly's 23-nation Consultative Committee's invitation to Japan to participate in the Sino-Japanese issue, League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol has recently received a reply from the Japanese government, expressing its refusal to participate. The reply stated, "The intention of the Japanese government is to promote cooperation between China and Japan to maintain peace in Asia. However, the Chinese government has consistently adopted an anti-Japanese attitude and has encouraged anti-Japanese agitation and provocative actions. The Japanese government believes that the solution to the Sino-Japanese issue should be sought between China and Japan. Therefore, the Japanese government believes that there is no reason to change its current attitude toward the political activities of the League of Nations. Therefore, the Japanese government cannot accept the invitation of the Consultative Committee, which it regrets." (Havas dispatch, 25th, Central News Agency)

[Geneva] According to news here, China is currently planning to take advantage of the indignation expressed by Britain and the United States at the Japanese bombing of Chinese cities to request that the League of Nations Consultative Committee, which will open on Monday, take appropriate countermeasures against Japan. Mr. Gu Weijun, China's chief representative to the League of Nations, refused to express his opinion on what these countermeasures might be. Mr. Gu only stated that the protests of Britain and the United States against Japan have now strengthened China's position. (National Telegram, 25th)

[Geneva] Britain, France, and Australia have all unanimously supported the convening of a Far East Conference. Soviet Russia has also indicated that it does not oppose it. China has also agreed to it under certain conditions. However, all countries believe that the conference is doomed without the participation of the United States. If the United States has a positive response to this, the League of Nations Consultative Committee, which will meet on Monday, should be able to draft a public announcement because the committee is composed of 23 countries, including the United States. (National Telegram, 25th)

[London] The Executive Committee of the British League of Nations Union recently submitted a resolution to the government, stating, "We firmly believe that the government will do everything possible to ensure that the League of Nations General Assembly's Consultative Committee on the Sino-Japanese issue determines where responsibility lies for the current war in China. If the committee decides that this responsibility should be borne by Japan, we request that the government publicly issue a declaration stating, "The British government is prepared to fulfill all the obligations stipulated by the League of Nations Covenant. The British government is prepared to participate in any measures that can effectively stop Japanese aggression, provided that a sufficient number of other countries come forward to participate so that it can have a practical effect. The British government also believes that the best method is for all relevant countries to unanimously refuse the import of Japanese goods as a boycott," and so on.

### New Dispute Between Japan and the Soviet Union Over Sakhalin Oil Extraction

Japanese Businesses Deliberately Violate Contracts; Large Numbers of Russian Workers Dismissed

[Moscow] According to reports from Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky, Japanese businessmen who have the right to mine coal and extract oil there have recently repeatedly and openly violated Soviet law. Most recently, they have openly violated the provisions of the concession contract, proving that these businessmen are clearly following a secret plan of some party in Japan to intentionally aggravate Soviet-Japanese relations. Therefore, local authorities and public organizations are extremely indignant.

In the spring of 1937, the Heavy Industry Committee, at the request of the Japanese oil concessionaires, gathered approximately 2,000 Soviet workers and sent them to Vladivostok. The businessmen should have immediately transported this group of workers to Sakhalin to work, but they not only did not do so, but instead made a number of unreasonable demands, claiming that if the Soviet side did not agree, they could not continue to transport the group of workers to Sakhalin. As a result, the workers were idle in Vladivostok for three months until the Soviet side resolutely demanded that they be sent to the island in mid-August.

As of early September, the Japanese businessmen suddenly began to dismiss a large number of Soviet workers whom they had voluntarily hired, and prepared to dismiss as many as 2,500 more in the near future. The reason given was that they were preparing to reduce the scope of work and completely stop exploration work indefinitely. However, the businessmen had originally vigorously requested to extend the Sakhalin oil extraction rights to five years, and the Soviet government, at the request of the Japanese government, had agreed to this last year. Furthermore, a few months ago, the businessmen had announced that they would greatly expand their oil extraction operations and had therefore requested the Soviet side to recruit a large number of workers on their behalf.

At the same time, Japanese businessmen who have the right to mine coal have also actually begun to dismiss a large number of workers. It is said that 1,500 people will be dismissed in September, leaving only 150 people in the entire area during the winter, which is actually equivalent to completely stopping work. These businessmen's actions are in complete violation of the concession contract, which stipulates that the Japanese side cannot unilaterally decide to reduce or suspend the work of the concession business. According to the local agency of the Heavy Industry Committee, these businessmen's actions will cause the Soviet side to suffer huge material losses.

According to the Japanese side's explanation to local officials, these illegal and suspicious actions are due to the fact that their work has encountered obstacles. This reason is clearly a fabrication, because in reality they can carry out legitimate work as long as their actions do not go beyond Soviet law and the concession contract. It is speculated that the real reason for these sudden actions by the businessmen is probably that since the start of the Japanese invasion of China, they have encountered great difficulties in finance, transportation, and other areas. Now, local agencies and trade unions are very indignant at these illegal actions and have asked the government to take necessary measures to protect Soviet interests and hope that the Heavy Industry Committee will stop the concessionaires from violating the contract and issue a serious warning. At the same time, local authorities also believe that all losses caused by the reduction in production should be claimed from the Japanese businessmen. (TASS dispatch, 24th)

### Detained Japanese Fishing Boats Successively Released by the Soviet Union

Fined for Violating Territorial Waters

⊙ Keijo, since the first ten days of June, all fishing boats departing from Korea to fish in the coastal waters of the Maritime Province have been detained by the Soviet side in the Port of De Castries, totaling as many as 70 boats. The reason for the detention was suspicion of violating territorial waters. All were brought to trial and each was sentenced to pay a fine of several hundred yuan. After the Japanese Consulate General in Vladivostok guaranteed the release of the boats, the fines were paid and the boats were successively released. Thus, the detention of Japanese fishing boats, which had been a major incident for a time, has come to an end. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 25th)

### Cooperation Needed Between Chinese and Foreign Groups for Rescuing Wounded Soldiers and Refugees

International Red Cross Special Envoy Advocates for Material Assistance from Allied European and American Nations

Continental Daily reports: According to Colonel Walter Ville, Special Envoy of the International Committee of the Red Cross, he told a Continental Daily reporter yesterday that he is currently conducting an investigation in Shanghai. If he finds that the Chinese Red Cross Society truly needs assistance to rescue Chinese wounded soldiers and refugees in the war zone, friendly nations in Europe and America will definitely provide substantial material assistance. The Colonel arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday to investigate the work of the Chinese Red Cross Society. Another important mission is to determine whether the belligerent countries are complying with the letter and spirit of the Red Cross rules, maintaining neutrality and avoiding harm. He will report on these matters in detail to the International Committee, hoping that the committee will provide material and moral support to the Chinese Red Cross Society. The Colonel will soon go to the capital and then north to investigate the work of the Red Cross Society in North China. The Colonel also stated that it is the established practice of the International Committee to send personnel to investigate whenever a war breaks out in a region. Based on the results of its investigations, the committee has sent medical teams, doctors, medicines, and funds to assist Spain and Abyssinia. The Colonel's main task in Shanghai is to determine how Geneva can assist the Chinese Red Cross Society. If it is determined that assistance is urgently needed, the Red Cross societies of European and American countries listed in the International Committee may be requested to transport medicines and supplies to China to assist the work of the Red Cross Society. After arriving in Shanghai, the Colonel immediately inspected the local hospitals, including those temporarily established. He was very pleased with the hard work and orderly service of the hospital staff. During this inspection, the Colonel felt that one of the most important things at present is to work together, especially when Chinese and foreign groups are working together. The Colonel said that in the important work of relieving refugees and wounded soldiers, one must not waste time or energy. The Colonel is also investigating the attack on the Chinese Red Cross rescue team by the Japanese army and the bombing by bombs. He said that the work of the Red Cross Society is based on not being attacked. During the investigation, he will strive to ensure that the warring parties abide by the international treaties of the Red Cross.

### Central Price of Autumn Cocoons in Zhejiang Province

Fresh cocoons priced at 40 yuan per picul, 70% cash, 30% on account

Autumn cocoons in Zhejiang Province have already begun to enter the market. During this extraordinary period, silk manufacturers and cocoon merchants are unable to purchase them, especially those in Shanghai. Although the Provincial Sericulture Control Committee has made great efforts to encourage them, it has ultimately been ineffective. To help silkworm farmers, it has been decided to organize the 1937 Autumn Cocoon Purchase Management Committee, which will use the 8.5 million yuan autumn cocoon loan from the four banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank of China) to purchase cocoons itself. The guaranteed price for autumn cocoons is set at 40 yuan per picul of fresh cocoons in national currency. However, only 70% of the payment will be made in cash at the time of purchase, with the remaining 30% recorded as an account receivable. If there is a surplus after the silk is reeled and sold, the account receivable will be paid accordingly; otherwise, it will not be paid. However, silk manufacturers can also purchase autumn cocoons according to the above method.

### Stock Exchange National Debt Account to be Settled at Limited Price

Accounts totaling over 100 million, with margin deposits over 10 million, proposed to be settled once at the Ministry of Finance's limited price

Since the stock exchange was closed due to the current situation, the large amount of national debt chips could not be traded. At that time, due to the scattering of customers, forward transactions could not be delivered on time. Therefore, a temporary expedient was adopted to transfer the August transactions to the September period with an interest subsidy of one percent. However, this method did not satisfy the money lenders. Later, although the exchange and the brokers' association once made a resolution to announce it, this method clearly contradicted the law and economics, and was opposed by the money lenders. According to experienced figures in the banking industry, to solve the problem once and for all, it is necessary to settle the national debt accounts at the Ministry of Finance's limited price. In fact, there is no hope of reopening the stock exchange in the short term, and it is impossible to postpone the settlement of this huge account of over 100 million yuan indefinitely. Moreover, the margin deposits placed by the exchange amount to over 10 million yuan. During this long period of resistance war, the funds cannot be left idle, which is inconvenient for both public and private reasons. Therefore, the exchange's brokers' association has also accepted the suggestion and convened a general meeting. On the 24th, it was resolved to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance, requesting it to order the board of directors to settle all transactions at the limited price to clear the procedures for both parties. Settlement at the limited price is the most appropriate way to resolve various disputes in the future. Apart from the exchange, there are no major problems. However, the outcome depends on the Ministry of Finance's approval.

The Ambassador's injuries have been improving recently and he will soon recover. All parties are very pleased to hear this. It is also reported that Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, British Ambassador to China, who was injured by a Japanese aircraft, has been treated at Hong En Hospital on Great Western Road for many days and has now recovered.

### Enemy Transport Ships Unload Munitions

In recent days, the transport ships carrying the enemy's fourth reinforcements to Shanghai have gradually sailed back to Japan in the past two days.

### The Enemy Intends to Land at Pudong Urgently; Intense Artillery Battles Ensue

Artillery fire has not ceased from yesterday until noon today. Enemy boats approached the Chunjiang Wharf but were repelled. Our heavy artillery bombarded enemy positions, causing significant damage.

Following several failed attempts to infiltrate Pudong, rumors of a large-scale enemy offensive have been circulating for the past few days. However, under the watchful guard of our troops, no drastic action has occurred until yesterday morning. From the Mitsubishi Wharf along the Pudong riverfront to the end of Yangshupu, the number of enemy ships suddenly increased. Besides transport ships and Red Cross vessels, there were over twenty warships gathered along the riverfront, stretching for about ten miles. All their gun emplacements were pointed towards Pudong. Upon receiving this information, our troops issued an order to the entire front line along the river,

Awaiting in Full Battle Array.

The situation immediately became extremely tense. Subsequently, after noon, enemy ships fired intermittently. Around 3 PM, thirteen enemy aircraft arrived in formation and wreaked havoc over the areas of Qichang Depot, Shiba Jian, Yangjing, Zhangjialou, Yangjiadu, Shenjia Nong, and Pudong Avenue, repeatedly bombing these locations. By 6 PM in the evening, it was estimated that no fewer than seventy or eighty bombs had been dropped. Most of the bombs fell in the fields, causing little damage except for a few houses that were affected and destroyed. At the same time, starting from 4 PM, enemy ships also began to

Open Fire and Bombard

It was estimated that a shell was fired every minute, continuing for about one hundred and several dozen rounds until the artillery fire became sparse around 6 PM in the evening, ceasing entirely at 7:15 PM. After a silence of about four hours, around 11 PM, our air force launched a night raid on Shanghai. The enemy ships, in a state of panic, fired wildly with anti-aircraft guns and machine guns. Fearing a pincer attack by our Pudong garrison, they resumed heavy bombardment with their artillery. Our positions, seeing that the time had come, responded with heavy artillery fire,

Resounding Through the Sky.

Houses were shaken by the impact. Our artillery shells landed in the enemy positions around Yangshupu. The intensity of the artillery battle was the first of its kind since the start of the Pudong conflict. Around midnight, four enemy boats, filled with sixty to seventy Japanese soldiers, approached the Chunjiang Wharf in Pudong under heavy artillery fire. The enemy opened fire, spraying the shore with machine guns. Simultaneously, two enemy warships also assisted with heavy machine gun fire. The machine gunners defending the dock entrance displayed remarkable skill, defending against both the warships and enemy boats while

Vigorously Returning Fire.

This made it exceedingly difficult for the enemy soldiers to advance. After about ten minutes of engagement, the enemy soldiers suffered casualties and were forced to retreat. Seeing their failure, the enemy ships reduced their artillery fire. Around 1 AM, when our air force returned to bomb again, the enemy ships densely bombarded Pudong once more. Our artillery also returned fire. The rumbling sounds continued until around 2 AM, after which the artillery fire became sporadic. Around 4 AM, intense artillery battles resumed. The enemy ships targeted our rear ×× positions. The intense fighting continued until around 5 AM, when two enemy boats again approached the Chunjiang Wharf in an attempt to

Launch a Second Sneak Attack.

Our troops continued to use machine guns to fire, the sound of gunfire exceptionally crisp. The enemy boats, realizing that our defenses were strong and difficult to breach, quickly fled under the intense pressure of our gunfire. However, the enemy warships continued their heavy bombardment until 6:30 AM, when it finally ceased. After this night of intense fighting in Pudong, our reporter set out to investigate at 8 AM this morning and found that the houses along the Pudong area were still intact, because the enemy ships' shells,

Devoid of Targets,

Some two to three hundred shells in total, all fell in the fields bordering ××. Our troops suffered no casualties. However, during the enemy aircraft bombing yesterday evening, four farmers harvesting rice near Maojia Zhai were killed and one was injured. Zhang Zhang, a woman, and Pu Mingming, a man, were injured in Zhangjialou, but their lives are not in danger. Also, around 11 AM this morning, enemy ships again opened fire on our Pudong positions, but since they had no targets, our side suffered no losses. The enemy's victory spin has also stopped.

South Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Decides to Boycott Japanese Goods. Ambassador Wang Sends Note to the U.S. Government Listing Japanese Atrocities.

[London] Since Japanese aircraft recklessly bombed and massacred civilians in China, an anti-Japanese movement has sprung up in England, rapidly gaining momentum. Today, the National Peace Council of England and the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, following the reports of other groups, passed resolutions protesting against Japan. The National Peace Council stated that the bombing of Guangzhou was "an act of extreme terror and horror" and lodged a protest with the Japanese Embassy in London. The Women's International League for Peace and Freedom has also sent a letter to the embassy, as well as a letter to Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and Under-Secretary Cranborne, urging the British government to pressure the Japanese government to stop the "massacre" and requesting that the British representative to the League of Nations make every effort to ensure that the League's Advisory Committee immediately consider Japan's bombing actions.

General Yang Hucheng delivered a brief speech, reporting on the situation in China, stating that the country is a unified, democratic nation, now united in resisting Japanese aggression. "Japan's ambition does not stop at conquering China. Therefore, if China can defeat Japan, it will be the best guarantee for peace in the Far East and Europe." Chairman Cot, on behalf of the Congress, expressed sympathy to China and asked Mr. Yang to convey to the Chinese people that the French have no animosity towards Japan, but since Japan is now engaged in acts of aggression, it is naturally spurned by the French. Mr. Atkinson and Mr. Stonehouse spoke in succession, also stating that the situation in the Far East is extremely serious and advocating for strong collective action to deal with Japan. (Central News Agency, 25th, Havas) ⊙ Lille, France After the houses of the French Catholic "Jesuit Society" in Xianxian County, Hebei Province, China, were bombed by Japanese aircraft yesterday, the authorities of the "Jesuit Society" here issued a public statement stating, "The area is densely populated, and the Japanese aircraft dropped as many as thirty bombs.

[Washington] Chinese Ambassador Dr. Wang Zhengting recently sent a note to the U.S. State Department listing the atrocities of the Japanese army. The full text is quite long, but it states in brief that Japan has inflicted cruelty on innocent Chinese civilians, patients, and wounded soldiers, even using poison gas, disregarding humanity. All the basic principles of international law have been completely destroyed. "Its crimes are so heinous that it is difficult to find appropriate words to condemn them." Chinese envoys to other countries will also send similar notes to their respective governments. Ambassador Wang also made a statement to the press, saying that the U.S. government had protested to Japan regarding the bombing of Chinese cities. The purpose of the note submitted by the Chinese government today is to increase the strength of the U.S. government's protest. However, he has not received orders from the government to request the U.S. government to protest again, as this is a matter for the U.S. government and not for outsiders to interfere with. He also has not been ordered to invoke the Nine-Power Treaty. When reporters asked him what he thought of the statement issued yesterday by U.S. Asia Fleet Commander Admiral Yarnell, Ambassador Wang replied that it was "wise".

### Trivial Commentary

— Nan

"Those with money contribute money; those with strength contribute strength." This is the most powerful expression of joining together to face national crisis. However, the definition of the three words "those with money" is the most difficult to define properly. If you say he has money, he will never admit it. If you say he has no money, he clearly has money. Even if he admits that he has money, he will still compare himself with others to show that he is not as wealthy as they are. This mentality cannot be said to be completely inappropriate, but it does have an impact on the "contributing money" aspect.

Therefore, the contribution of money by those with money also requires enthusiastic individuals among the wealthy to promote it, so that it can achieve the greatest effect. If the following types of people can come forward to promote the purchase of national salvation bonds, the effect will be much greater than sporadic solicitations like sesame seeds.

㊀ People who have made huge profits from speculation in gold bars, yarn, flour, and wheat in the past three years.

㊁ Wealthy people who hoard gold and silver and store foreign currency.

㊂ Ladies who live extravagantly, indulging in the enjoyment of human blessings, and are unaware of the hardships of the poor.

As long as they can be motivated, very huge and considerable numbers can be obtained. In today's society, if more people like Que Gu, Yu Sou Xian Gao, and Bu Shi are produced, I think people will only respect and sympathize with them. No one will dare to privately criticize them, nor will thieves be tempted. Moreover, they can get rewards from the national government, and they can recover both principal and interest in full when the bonds mature. There is probably no better way to achieve both fame and fortune in the world than this.

### Over a Thousand Overseas Chinese Return from Japan

Arriving in Shanghai Today on the Xinjiang Steamer; Over Three Hundred Natives of Ningbo Will Return Home on the Same Ship

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, there have been many instances of overseas Chinese returning from Japan. It is now learned that the Xinjiang steamer, which arrived in Shanghai this afternoon, also carries more than a thousand overseas Chinese, of whom more than three hundred are natives of Ningbo. The Ningbo Natives Association in Shanghai received a telegram from Gu Ruibao of the Sanjiang Public Association in Japan yesterday, so it has appointed Dong Xinqin and other executives to go to the Taikoo Wharf to welcome them and distribute tea, snacks, medicines, and other comforts. It is also heard that the Association will persuade the natives of Ningbo to return to Ningbo on the same ship.

### We Are "Forced" to Hold an Exhibition Here

We are "forced"—to hold an exhibition here.

They not only use "military warfare," land warfare, naval warfare, and air warfare, to invade us, they also aggressively invade us with "combined warfare." "Economic aggression," isn't it? "Political warfare" involving many unequal treaties, isn't it? They also want to use "ideological warfare" to suppress us. "Cultural aggression" is already enough, but they are not satisfied. On Chinese territory, they dare to use "cultural suppression" to suppress us—we Chinese!

Although the works of us children are not only naive but simply scribbled, and it can rightly be said that they resemble nothing at all? One spot of red here, one spot of black there, they really can't be considered paintings, let alone famous or valuable paintings. But when they only know how to take a broom-like brush, stir some colors on the tip, and scribble randomly on the paper, they only feel the enemy's planes whirling "whoosh whoosh" overhead, and the enemy's heavy artillery booming "rumble rumble" in their ears. They only feel that our loyal and brave soldiers are raising their bayonets on the front line, charging! A bayonet thrusts forward, killing! The enemies fall backward one by one, and our loyal and brave soldiers charge forward! In the trenches, by the barbed wire, on the ground, in the sky, everything is red—red blood, red artillery fire, the red hearts of our brave soldiers. We only know how to follow our minds and take up the brush, scribbling on the paper as frantically and excitedly as if we were killing the enemy on the front line. We only know that this is called "spirit"! This is called "strength"! We scribble one after another, piling up so much "spirit"! So much "strength"!

We don't know if they are paintings, because we are not famous artists, great painters! We hope you will forgive these frantic children.

We started working on this from the first day the enemy invaded our Shanghai, and it's been less than a month and a half. But we are comforted that all our work is finally completed. We offer comfort every day, visiting almost every wounded soldier hospital and every shelter. We asked cartoonists to paint three giant patriotic paintings for us (we also wanted to exhibit them, and during the "September 18th Incident," we wanted to parade them on a large truck... but...). We also learned to collaborate on a giant "Chinese Vanguard Team," ready to dedicate it to the government. Although it doesn't look like anything, we ourselves see millions of Chinese soldiers inside, countless tanks, and teams of artillery vehicles emerging from the iron Great Wall in a mighty array. In the city, four large cannons also protrude, and in the sky, there are countless planes. This is our air force, awakening the invaders from their delusions, flying out from the Great Wall in large squadrons!

We made it from a small piece of paper only twelve square feet in size. It's pitiful that these frantic children only eat hard Shandong pancakes and drink plain boiled water, but we have finally done this in a short month and a half, and sent the "Chinese Children" to the children of the whole country. "In the Fire of War" (written from the fire of war of "January 28th" to the current "August 13th," "Put Down Your Whip," "Dreaming of Beiping," writing about the lost capital) has also been performed and is being filmed by the Lianhua branch factory.

Now we are "forced," forced not to continue doing it here! But, we, the invaders will not die for a day, and our work will not rest for a day.

We only know that we have "spirit"! We have "strength"!

We are forced to go to the capital first, taking two routes, from Hankou to Sichuan... to shake hands with the compatriots in the hinterland! To Nanyang, to shake hands with our beloved overseas compatriots!

We are forced, forced to leave here, goodbye!

### The True Joy in the Paintings

— Chen Juanjuan, Age Nine

We children don't understand hypocrisy, nor do we tell lies. Everything comes from the bottom of our hearts. When we are sad, we open our mouths and cry. When we are happy, we laugh a lot. Adults say we are innocent. This innocence must mean that we don't deliberately pretend.

For example, when we draw pictures, we also don't understand what restraint is. Recently, I have made many paintings, specifically taking this war of resistance as the background. The more I paint, the happier I become. The happier I am, the more I want to paint. I draw a large plane flying to the enemy headquarters, dropping a large bomb that destroys all the houses below. I also draw the Chinese Big Sword Team, killing all the heads of the enemy one by one, and another Chinese soldier brings them back. The soldiers of the Chinese Big Sword Team also stride back spiritedly, showing off: "Am I brave?" I have painted dozens of such anti-enemy paintings, and everyone says, "Good! Good!"

Now my large works have been sent to the Children's Patriotic Cartoon Exhibition for all the adults and gentlemen to give me your advice. Goodbye.

### Everyone, Come and Kill Those Who Invade Us!

— Shen Jun, Age Sixteen

### Two Satisfying Works

— Li Keng, Age Nine

I like to play ping-pong, and everyone knows that I like to play ping-pong. But recently I don't like to play ping-pong anymore. Why? Because I'm focused on drawing pictures, desperately drawing pictures. I want to draw three pictures a day. My most satisfying picture is called: "Dare You Come In? I'll Give You a Knife and a Gun!" This painting of a knife and a gun is very powerful and hard, full of spirit. Another satisfying picture is called "Triumph," depicting a row of Chinese soldiers with their faces covered in blood, but their faces are smiling indifferently, and their hands are reaching up high to wave to us. These two large paintings are on display in this exhibition in front of all the gentlemen.

### Why Can't We Draw the Rising Sun Flag?

— Mou Ling, Age Seven

Before we opened the "First Children's Patriotic Cartoon Exhibition," we were very enthusiastic about drawing patriotic cartoons. We finally finished drawing them one by one. Some of them had the Japanese Rising Sun Flag on them, but I heard that these paintings couldn't be exhibited and that the Rising Sun Flag had to be painted over. Hmph! I'm really angry. Why can't we draw the Rising Sun Flag of the enemies who are invading us?

### Look at the Gun!

— Xu Xiangying, Age Fifteen

### Cartooning for National Salvation

— Yao Yuanyan, Age Fourteen

The brutal Japanese have been invading our country for several decades. Although we also wrote many slogans during the "January 28th Incident": "Down with Japanese Imperialism" and "Boycott Japanese Goods," etc., I haven't seen this kind of situation since the "January 28th Incident" ended.

The "August 13th" Shanghai War is the prelude to a full-scale Sino-Japanese war. We children wanted to write some words to publicize the brutal killing of our compatriots by the brutal Japanese and the sacrifice of our loyal soldiers for the country, but we couldn't write them. So we thought of giving speeches, but it's impossible without good drafts. We can't give speeches either, so we failed again. Finally, we figured it out. We can use drawings to express ourselves. We know that our soldiers are brave and kind, so we drew a kind and brave face. We know that Japanese soldiers are brutal and cowardly, so we drew a vicious and frightened face. We know what colors things are, so we added those colors. We want to let all the children of Shanghai, all the people of Shanghai, know our ability. We want to let all the people of China know the power of our little citizens and the brutality of the Japanese devils!

### Charge! Charge! The Bugle Call of the Charge! Charge!

— Wang Ziqing, Age Sixteen

### National Salvation and Cartoons

— Shen Jun, Age Fifteen

We have been bullied by the Japanese devils for many years, and now we have to rise up and resist. So we are here drawing many pictures to show our courage, because Japan has dared to hurt us too deeply. We know what it's like when cannons fire. What are Japanese devils like? What are Chinese troops like? Airplanes, guns, cannons, bombs, Big Sword Teams, warships, and all kinds of weapons are drawn here. We want to cheer up, go and kill the hateful Japanese devils, drive out our enemies, and recover our land. We don't want to be subjugated slaves. Everyone must stand tall and protect our land. This is the meaning of our opening cartoons for national salvation.

### Why Open a "National Salvation Cartoon" Exhibition?

— Jiang Quqiao, Age Sixteen

Why are we opening a "National Salvation Cartoon" exhibition? Tell you, children: We see that the country has been made very bad by the Japanese bandits, and our brave soldiers are killing Japanese pigs and deer on the front line. Our hearts ache for the country. We really hate it. Why are we so small? Otherwise, we would also like to shoulder guns and take big swords to the front line and have a great time killing.

The country belongs to everyone. When the country is in danger, everyone should rise up to save it. We don't have the strength to shoulder guns. Does that mean we shouldn't save the country? We are Chinese. We are Chinese who don't want to be subjugated slaves. We are afraid that people will scold us for being subjugated slaves, useless things. We want to save the country. Everyone is willing. If we have a little strength, we will take a little strength to save it. We twenty or so children think every day, thinking about doing our best for the country.

On August 29th, we came up with the idea. We will create patriotic drawings for publicity, using drawings to tell children how dangerous the country is; our soldiers are very bravely killing Japanese devils on the front line; we should all rise up, rise up to save the country from this danger. When we thought of it, we drew it. We draw desperately every day. Now there are so many. Although they are not well drawn, we also feel very satisfied.

We are really comfortable, because we have also done a little bit of our strength for the country. And we will work harder in the future, and we will have a second and third cartoon exhibition!

### Rise Up! Children of All China!

— Jiang Baisheng, Age Sixteen

### Children's Cartoon Exhibition

— Xu Xiangying, Age Fifteen

The full-scale war of resistance has already begun, and the blood of all Chinese compatriots is boiling along with it. Those with strength contribute strength, those with money contribute money. The soldiers in the front are fighting bravely against the enemy. They are shedding their hot blood on the battlefield to defend China, this country with a four-thousand-year history and four hundred and fifty million descendants of the Yellow Emperor. But we are all very naive and ignorant children. In terms of our abilities, we certainly cannot go to the battlefield to kill the enemy, but we are also the people of China. We should all take on a great mission to contribute to our motherland.

So, during this summer vacation, we gathered many children and organized a Children's National Salvation Association. Our knowledge is certainly very shallow. Several times we wanted to do some work, such as fundraising, but because of the darkness of the real society and the many traitors, our work could not continue. Under the leadership of Mr. Huang, we finally decided to open a children's cartoon exhibition in the shortest possible time. All the children are working excitedly. Although our achievements are not very good and there is no direct benefit to the country, when every citizen looks at that red blood and artillery fire, I think everyone will be moved. Soon we will contribute it to the compatriots of every Republic of China. I hope you will give us correct criticism and guidance.

### National Salvation Efforts from All Sectors

Children's Sector

The Children's National Salvation Association held a reception yesterday at 3 p.m. for representatives of various sectors, including authorities, charitable organizations, national salvation associations, news agencies, and newspapers, totaling more than 50 people. First, the person in charge of the association reported on the recent developments and work plans of the association. The work is divided into five departments: comfort, national salvation propaganda, film, publication, and drama. The drama department has already rehearsed three national salvation plays, "Put Down Your Whip," "In the Midst of Fire," and "Dreaming of Beiping," starring Li Keng, Chen Juanjuan, Mou Ling, and others. They will first perform at various refugee camps and wounded soldier hospitals, and then go to various places with the national salvation propaganda department to promote national salvation. The film department will film the three children's national salvation plays that have been arranged and carry them to various towns and villages for mobile screenings. Representatives from the children's sector, Li Keng, Chen Juanjuan, and Mou Ling, then gave speeches. The meeting adjourned after more than an hour.

Cartoon Sector

Since the birth of the inaugural issue of "National Salvation Cartoons," it has been praised by the general public and purchased in large quantities by enthusiastic readers for posting in various neighborhoods or refugee camps. Therefore, the inaugural issue of the newspaper was once reprinted. It is reported that the first issue is scheduled to be published today (the 26th). The content is richer. The cover is "Japanese Carrying Corpses Back Home" by Jiang Mi; the continuous cartoons "We Have No Home" by Cai Ruohong; "The Great Change in Shanghai" by Chen Chuza; "The Flame of Justice Spreads Across the East Asian Continent" by Shen Zhengeng; "Unexpected Sympathy from the International Community for the Japanese" by Xuan Xiangquan; and "Five-Day Guide Cartoon" by Lu Shaofei. All are carefully crafted works that can attack the enemy with satirical techniques or encourage the patriotic sentiment of compatriots with encouraging pictures. It is expected that this issue of "National Salvation Cartoons" will be even more welcomed by readers.

### The State of the Japanese Navy

— Yi Zang

In 1921, the Washington Naval Conference of Five Nations was held, and the result was. It stipulated the ratio of naval power for the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan in terms of capital ships. The ratio was 5:5:3. That is, the United Kingdom and the United States each possessed a total tonnage of 525,000 tons of capital ships. Japan had 315,000 tons. Later, Japan violated the treaty. Secretly built ships. Therefore, after the London Conference. Japan again proposed equality. As a result, the meeting broke down due to opposition from various countries. Since then. Japan has entered an era without treaties. Vigorously expanding its military, how many capital ships and auxiliary ships does it actually have now? That is not easy to understand. Based on a survey five years ago, there were a total of 383 ships, totaling 1,155,600 tons. The major battleships included:

A. Capital ships (battleships): Mutsu (33,800 tons) equipped with eight 16-inch guns; Nagato (33,800 tons) (same as above); Hyuga (31,260 tons) equipped with eleven 14-inch guns; Ise (same as above) (same as above); Yamashiro (30,600 tons) (same as above); Fuso (same as above) (same as above); (battlecruisers) Kirishima (27,500 tons) (equipped with eight 14-inch guns); Haruna (30,500 tons) (same as above); Hiei (27,500 tons) (same as above); Kongo (same as above).

The above is based only on the ships that were completed five years ago. There are no accurate figures available for those that have been built successively in the past five years, as the Navy Ministry strictly maintains secrecy. Approximately since the entry into the era without treaties, Japan has been vigorously building a large number of warships to compete with the United States. Among them, submarines have exceeded the United States, becoming a ratio of 8.5 to 10 for the United States and ranking first among the five countries. The number of Japanese ships compared to Washington and England is 5.00, to the United States 3.46, to France 1.15, to Italy 1.15, while Japan has as many as 8.84 ships. Japan is expanding its navy in this way to widely promote the southward advance policy. In other words, it is to develop its power in the South Seas.
