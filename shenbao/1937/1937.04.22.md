### Newspaper Reports of False Information is the Claim of a Minority

It Will Naturally Subside if There is No Factual Basis. Shimizu Said to the Central News Agency Reporter

[Nanjing] Recently, a small number of newspapers in Tokyo have often published rumors that stimulate the feelings of the people of China and Japan. The reporter specifically visited the Japanese Embassy to inquire about the situation. Secretary Shimizu came out to meet with him. According to the conversation, since the suspension of Sino-Japanese negotiations, the movement of Japanese citizens advocating a re-understanding of China has indeed been quite enthusiastic. The opinions published by the Yomiuri Shimbun and other newspapers are the claims of another group of people. I dare not guess the rise and fall of the two forces. It depends on how the facts develop in the future. If the rumors have no factual basis, they will naturally subside soon. As for what you call the background, I think the Yomiuri Shimbun and other newspapers are large newspapers with status, so they should not publish this. The circulation of the "Evening Empire" is extremely small and will not have much impact. Shimizu is scheduled to accompany Kawagoe to Shanghai on the morning of the 22nd and will stay for about four or five days before returning to Nanjing. Kawagoe will return to his country to report on his duties after meeting with Counselor Hidaka. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 21st)

### Important Clues Obtained in the Kidnapping Case on the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway

Current Commentary

### Thoughts on the Sichuan Disaster

— Du

Sichuan Province, known as the "Land of Abundance," is currently experiencing an unprecedented drought. It is said that the disaster area extends to 134 counties, with the number of starving people increasing to over 35 million. This must be said to be a serious situation. Although the provincial government has raised 140,000 yuan for emergency relief and prepared a 6 million yuan work-for-relief plan, these efforts are a drop in the bucket and are still ineffective. Therefore, on one hand, they are appealing to charitable organizations to actively donate funds to alleviate the immediate crisis, and on the other hand, they are requesting the central government to issue disaster relief bonds to ensure a proper recovery. While there may be no other better methods, we feel that the wounded people of Sichuan, faced with such a critical juncture of natural disasters and man-made calamities, should also take this opportunity to make a precise plan regarding how to address the root causes of the disaster and how to find a path to survival in the future.

In the past, everyone knew that Sichuan Province was in a state of warlord separatism. The suffering inflicted on the people of Sichuan as a result of each round of fighting, the depletion of resources, the scattering of the population, the extraction of essence, and the loss of vitality - all of these circumstances are enough to make one feel disheartened. As for the lives directly sacrificed by the military, and the fields indirectly devastated by the war, the cumulative losses are even more difficult to accurately calculate. It is said that at that time, some people in Sichuan had already paid land taxes up to the 54th year of the Republic. This shows the extent of the means of extortion. No matter how rich an area is, it cannot withstand such heavy exploitation. Therefore, while the formation of this Sichuan famine can be said to be due to natural disasters, when investigating the reasons for the intensification of the disaster, there is also a causal relationship with human affairs. Understanding this, how should the people of Sichuan make a resolution to prevent the recurrence of war in the future?

Since the central government decided to manage the southwest, Sichuan Province has also occupied a temporary center of gravity. At that time, military commanders personally went to inspect and discuss everything with the Sichuan authorities. They also stationed there for a while, bringing many conveniences. As a result, Sichuan Province has integrated with the central government and could have been built up properly to restore its original prosperity. However, the unruly elements are still being used from time to time, carrying out their schemes of destruction. Three months ago, there were rumors that a large-scale secret organization was discovered in Chengdu. Recently, many unfounded rumors have been spread, almost disrupting the peaceful atmosphere. Although this episode has now been explained, it also shows that the toxic bacteria that are intentionally harming the province are still lurking in the dark side of society, with the potential to stir at any time. This is greatly disadvantageous to the people of Sichuan. There should be an appropriate preparation on how to eradicate them. One must know what a piercing fact the picture of displaced disaster victims before our eyes is.

Regarding the urgent relief of Sichuan, the central government has allocated 1 million yuan in public bonds and remitted over 700,000 yuan in cash to Chongqing. Zhu Qinglan, chairman of the National Relief Committee, has also flown to Chongqing to begin distributing the funds. The director of the Sichuan Civil Affairs Department has also proposed many plans to be implemented. It seems that there will be a way to treat the symptoms. If we want to learn from the past and prevent future problems, how should we use the entire strength to prevent the recurrence of vitality injuries? This depends on the efforts of the people of Sichuan themselves in the future.

### Washington Reports that China Plans to Borrow Foreign Debt

Building Railways and Developing Production - A Natural Trend with Political Stability

[Washington] Chinese officials here announced today that the Chinese National Government may issue foreign debt to build railways and develop production, thereby strengthening domestic institutions. The Chinese government has recently been preparing to repay the 1911 Hukuang Railway loan and the 1919 Chicago Bank loan, and has been negotiating with the United States to clear old debts, such as the Pacific Construction loan. This move to repay old debts will enhance China's foreign credit, making it easier to issue new loans. If China issues foreign debt again, it will generally seek funds from London first, followed by the United States. US government officials told the Associated Press that they had not heard of China's borrowing plans, but that this would not be surprising, as the Chinese government's income has increased recently and the political situation is very secure. Currently, except for the three northeastern provinces, all provinces are under the rule of the National Government, and the political situation is extremely stable. (20th National Telegram)

### Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun Publishes Headline Stating that Britain Suggested Cooperation with Japan on China

Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Claims Ignorance - British Representative in Tokyo Claims It Is Exaggerated

[Tokyo] The Nichinichi Shimbun today published a news item with a large headline stating that Britain recently informally informed the Japanese government of its willingness to establish Anglo-Japanese cooperation in China, or an Anglo-Japanese understanding. With Britain initiating this proposal, Anglo-Japanese cooperation negotiations in China can begin soon. These negotiations will first focus on establishing a solid foundation for Sino-Japanese relations in order to seek the normal operation of Chinese customs. (Central News Agency 21st Reuters Dispatch)

[Tokyo] A Reuters reporter recently visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ask whether the news in this morning's Nichinichi Shimbun about Britain's informal notification to the Japanese government of its willingness to establish Anglo-Japanese cooperation or understanding in China was accurate. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson immediately stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was completely unaware of this development and that the Nichinichi Shimbun was completely fabricated. Other sources related to the government also stated that the news published by the Nichinichi Shimbun was unfounded and purely exploratory. (Central News Agency 20th Reuters Dispatch)

[Tokyo] This morning, the Nichinichi Shimbun reported that Britain had recently informally stated its intention to cooperate with Japan on China, and that Britain's proposal had three preconditions: ㊀ consolidating Sino-Japanese relations, ㊁ safeguarding Britain's existing rights and interests in China, and ㊂ jointly assisting China. It is said that the content of the cooperation is that, on the one hand, Britain recognizes the existence of the Manchurian organization, and if Japan has no territorial ambitions in North China, Britain also recognizes Japan's special relationship and interests in North China. On the other hand, Japan respects Britain's existing rights and interests in China and takes joint action in financial and economic policies towards China. The newspaper also stated that, regarding this point, Foreign Minister Sato Naotake strongly advocated at the Three-Minister Conference on the 20th when discussing the Soviet Union and China that in order to realize Japan's continental policy, it is necessary to make Britain clearly understand Japan's position. Therefore, for the sake of Anglo-Japanese cooperation, it is necessary to adjust Sino-Japanese relations. It is heard that Sato's proposal has been supported by Army Minister Sugiyama Gen and Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa. Therefore, the newspaper predicts that the two countries will soon begin negotiations on mutual cooperation, starting with the China problem. The newspaper further speculates that Britain's motivation for making the above proposal at this time is twofold: ㊀ to protect Britain's existing economic development in China, and ㊁ to adopt Britain's traditional policy of maintaining a balance of power in the Far East. Regarding the former, the newspaper pointed out that Britain's recent investments in various enterprises in China have made Britain feel that in order to maintain its current position, it is best to have Japan recognize its superior position in East Asia and obtain the guarantee of cooperation in order to stabilize East Asia. Regarding the latter, the newspaper stated that Britain feels that assisting the Soviet Union in increasing its position in the Far East is excessive, so it feels the need to contact Japan to restrain the excessive development of the Soviet Union in the Far East. However, the spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that he was not aware of the above news beforehand, and expressed that such news is likely speculation by the Nichinichi Shimbun. Also, according to British sources here, the claim that Britain has made a proposal to Japan is at least an exaggeration. However, it is true that British diplomatic representatives in Tokyo are constantly urging the Japanese government to resolve the smuggling problem, and this problem is of course closely related to the problem of adjusting Chinese relations. As for all the other rumors, they seem to have two intentions: ㊀ to obstruct contact between China and Britain and indirectly resist the alleged hard-line attitude of China towards Japan, and ㊁ to test the atmosphere in London and Moscow. Japan seems to have recognized the mistake of continuing to oppose China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The conclusion is that although the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations is difficult to achieve directly between the two countries, if Japan's relations with Britain or the Soviet Union can be improved, Japan's position in China will at least be strengthened. Therefore, the above news is worthy of attention. (Central News Agency 21st Dispatch)

Must Be Studied

[Geneva] The Advisory Committee on Social Issues of the League of Nations continued its meeting today. The vice chairman, Yokoyama, the Japanese Consul General in Geneva, explained the situation in which the Japanese government is striving for the happiness of children, stating that Japan is a country with an overpopulation, so it pays special attention to this issue. At this time, the population policy adopted by the country is to improve the people's physical condition and improve their knowledge, not to increase the population. He therefore proposed that the Advisory Committee make recommendations to the governments of various countries, advocating that the League of Nations should closely study the issue of child protection.

### Japanese Army Minister Concerned About Physique of Recruits

Visibly Declining

[Tokyo] Army Minister Sugiyama Gen strongly emphasized the necessity of maintaining national health at the cabinet meeting on the 21st, saying that he had previously inspected the Kansai region and visited Wakayama Prefecture and the Kyoto region near the industrial city of Osaka to inspect the physical examination of rural recruits. He discovered that the physique of rural recruits, which had always been considered superior to that of urban recruits, has been declining year by year. Thinking of the future of the country, this is truly worrying. The reason is that each place is close to the commercial and industrial cities of Osaka and Kobe. Only about three or four tenths of the children in rural areas stay in the countryside. Most of them go out to seek work, bring disease back to the countryside after cultivating its source in the city, and transmit it to the countryside. This tendency is gradually becoming a national phenomenon, so it is necessary to give it special consideration in order to maintain national health. (21st Allied Dispatch)

### British Labor Unrest Becomes Increasingly Serious

Miners Brew General Strike

[London] The machinists at the British Beardmore factory voted today by 1,015 votes to 64 to continue the strike that began on April 18. All strikers should be subsidized by the machinists' union. At the same time, British miners everywhere have voted on the outcome of the Nottingham mining dispute and have now voted to issue a strike notice. A total of 444,546 votes were in favor of supporting the striking miners in Nottingham, while only 61,445 votes were against. According to this vote, the Miners' Union has the right to take action to announce a national strike if the negotiations in the Nottingham dispute fail and the problem of union recognition is not resolved. Miners' representatives will meet in London on the 30th of this month to consider the issue of issuing a strike notice. The dispute in the Nottingham mining area arose from the demand by the miners to have the right to join the national union rather than the local union. Negotiations ended in stalemate. The Minister of Mines recently declared in the Lower House that he was willing to do his best to seek a resolution of this dispute. (Central News Agency 20th Reuters Dispatch)

### World Economic Conference: United States Willing to Participate

But Unwilling to Take the Lead　Japan Also Declares Willingness to Attend

[Washington] President Roosevelt recently gave a speech to the press, discussing the talks conducted by British Labour Party figure Ramsay MacDonald and German leader Hitler. He stated that he has always advocated improving the world economic situation, but the President did not specify what methods he intends to use to achieve this goal. Regarding the declaration made by British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain yesterday in the House of Commons regarding national defense expenditure in the 1937-38 budget, he said that countries rearming have different purposes. Some do so to facilitate attacks on other countries, while others do so purely for self-defense and not out of their own volition. These should not be treated the same. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from Washington, 20th)

[Washington] Congressman Thies today announced his advocacy for convening a world monetary conference, but President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull advocate that European countries should take responsibility for convening it. Hull believes that countries will find it difficult to achieve effective international action unless they first establish regional agreements. However, Undersecretary of State Welles stated that if Europe convenes such a conference, the United States would be willing to participate, because the arms race will lead to cultural bankruptcy. We must do our best to promote international military and economic restrictions. Welles was very pleased with German leader Hitler's statement to British Independent Labour Party representative Ramsay MacDonald that Germany is willing to participate in international conferences, but fears that countries have not yet considered convening any conferences. (National Telegraph, 20th)

[Washington] There are rumors that the US government will change its gold policy. Congressman Thies has proposed requesting President Roosevelt to convene a world monetary conference. US Treasury officials remain silent on the matter, only stating that there is no change in US monetary policy. Rumors from New York suggest that the United States, Britain, and France will adopt a "gold quota system," restricting gold purchases to the United States only, in order to prevent gold from flowing into the United States. Government officials have refused to discuss this. According to financial experts, the rumors from London and New York that the United States will change its gold policy are intended to disrupt the market. The financial community is very concerned about the proposal by Congressman Thies, leader of the silver faction in the House of Representatives and initiator of the silver purchase plan, to convene a world monetary conference. (National Telegraph, 20th)

[Tokyo] It is reported that if a world economic conference is convened, the Japanese government is prepared to participate if Japan receives a formal invitation. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from Tokyo, 21st)

### Spanish Rebel Blockade of Ports

Continued Discussion in the British House of Commons

[London] After Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain presented the 1937-38 budget in the House of Commons, opposition Labour Party Member of Parliament and former First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander immediately raised questions about the issue of the Port of Bilbao in northern Spain and vehemently attacked the government's stance, saying it "completely contradicts the finest traditional spirit of Britain." He also stated that the blockade implemented by the Spanish Nationalist forces is an illegal act, the result of which will be that the residents of the Port of Bilbao will starve to death. The British government's expression of submission and refusal to protect its own merchant ships is inappropriate. Moreover, the Port of Bilbao is not actually blockaded; if it is, it is only blockaded by the British government. This action is a violation of the non-intervention agreement and benefits the Nationalist forces. "Given the current situation," we must demand that the government change its policy, or else resign to apologize to the people. First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Hoare immediately stood up to reply, explaining that the Admiralty has always maintained an absolutely neutral attitude towards both sides of the Spanish Civil War. According to information obtained by the Admiralty, there are indeed several Nationalist warships patrolling the coast of the Basque region of Spain, while the naval strength of the government forces is weaker. Furthermore, the Nationalist forces have indeed laid mines along the coast, and two government minesweepers sank after hitting mines six weeks ago, which is clear evidence. He also said that the British government has notified the Spanish Nationalist government that Britain will not tolerate any actions taken by the Nationalist forces against British merchant ships. Finally, he said that, based on the current situation, the government's original policy is subject to revision. If the blockade of the Port of Bilbao is not actually effective, then the Admiralty will be the first to acknowledge it and change its current attitude. At this point, opposition Liberal Party leader Lloyd George spoke, expressing opposition to the government's non-intervention policy in general, stating, "One side of the Spanish Civil War has approximately 100,000 foreign troops participating in the fighting, with extremely sharp weapons and complete equipment, while the other side has 10,000 to 15,000 foreign troops assisting. If Sir Hoare considers this clear evidence that the non-intervention policy is being effectively implemented, then he is indeed very certain." Foreign Secretary Eden spoke last, stating that the government is currently willing to strictly adhere to neutrality in the Spanish Civil War, and that the current situation is not necessarily immutable. At this point, the Labour Party proposed a motion opposing the adjournment of the House of Commons to express its hostility towards the government. As a result, the House of Commons rejected this motion by a vote of 119 to 49. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from London, 20th)

[London] Former First Lord of the Admiralty and Labour Party leader Alexander stated that if the British government acknowledges that what is being blockaded is not only military supplies but also civilian food, then the British government is directly tacitly consenting to the starvation of women and children. He cannot acknowledge that the Spanish Nationalist forces have effectively blockaded the Port of Bilbao until he receives more detailed information. First Lord of the Admiralty Hoare replied that the British naval policy is to protect British ships at sea and that the government does not intend to send warships into Spanish territorial waters, not because there is danger, but because this might hinder the non-intervention agreement. The government firmly believes that a new phase of the non-intervention policy is now beginning to develop, so it believes that it is extremely important not to add fuel to the fire, and that the government should maintain the non-intervention policy in spirit and form. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from London, 20th)

⊙ Bilbao: The British grain ship "Seven Seas" has today entered the Port of Bilbao and has been warmly welcomed by the government forces, showing that the rebel blockade plan is largely ineffective. A member of the Basque government stated that the ship was escorted by a British destroyer to a point fifteen miles offshore, and then escorted into the port by the government fleet. (National Telegraph, 20th)

⊙ Bayonne: The British cargo ship "Seven Seas," loaded with grain, set sail from the Port of Saint-Jean-de-Luz yesterday and has now arrived at the Port of Bilbao in northern Spain. According to a communiqué issued by the information office of the Basque Autonomous Region of Spain, there are currently cruisers and auxiliary ships belonging to the government forces within the territorial waters of the autonomous region, providing strict protection, and ship navigation is without danger, as can be seen from the safe arrival of the "Seven Seas" at the Port of Bilbao. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from London, 20th)

[London] In order to transport grain to the ports belonging to the Spanish government forces and provide food relief to the people, the Independent Labour Party has raised funds to establish a shipping company dedicated to this task. The board of directors of the shipping company is scheduled to meet today to pass the articles of association and decide on the course of action. According to Independent Labour Party Secretary Brockway's statement to a Havas reporter, the company has decided to purchase a ship for 40,000 pounds, which has now been raised, but the insurance issue remains to be resolved. In addition to members of the Independent Labour Party, the shareholders of the company include many prominent figures from the Liberal Party and the Labour Party.

### British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain Presents Budget to the House of Commons

Deficit Reaches Over 14 Million Pounds　Increased Income Tax and New Profits Tax

[London] The main points of this year's budget presented by Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain this afternoon in the House of Commons are as follows: ㊀ Income tax will be increased by three pence per pound, from four shillings and nine pence to five shillings. ㊁ A new tax will be implemented, called the National Defence Contribution. All businesses engaged in industry and commerce with annual profits exceeding 2,000 pounds will be required to pay this tax, ranging from one-fifth to one-third, depending on the extent of their profit growth, taking into account depreciation over the past four years.

The estimated revenue for this year is £847,940,000, and the expenditure is £862,848,000, resulting in a deficit of £14,898,000. This amount can be reduced to below £2,000,000 due to the increase in income tax (last year's revenue and expenditure offset showed a deficit of £5,597,000).

㊃ The preferential tax on silk stockings produced in the British Empire will be revised. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from London, 20th)

[London] London circles generally say that the sixth budget presented by Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain during his tenure is particularly prudent. People are not paying much attention to the increase in income tax, as this was expected. However, they are paying close attention to the new tax named "National Defence Contribution," viewing it as a revival of the "excess profits tax." This new tax was not expected by the general public, and its detailed measures are currently difficult to predict. However, industrial stocks have not been affected much as a result, and market prices seem to be on the rise. This new tax, on the whole, is particularly fair, as it is estimated to generate 25 million pounds per year, which is more convenient than drastically increasing income tax rates. This budget can make British financial policy clearer, as the Chancellor has predicted that the revenue from various taxes can be expected to increase, and he naturally does not want to hinder the inflationary trend caused by the cheap money policy. At the same time, the "National Defence Contribution" can guide companies to invest a large portion of their income in industry, thereby reducing the risk of labor unrest. As for whether companies will change their registration to foreign countries due to excessive taxation, it is difficult to predict. Before the budget was announced, oil stocks were deeply concerned about the imposition of new taxes, so the market was particularly quiet. Now the price has risen sharply. According to the recent rumors of "the revival of the American gold panic," which were immediately denied by the authorities, and now the budget has been announced one after another, with no surprising points, it is hoped that market rumors will cease from now on. Metal prices have already risen first, and tea merchants are very happy because the budget did not increase the tea tax. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from London, 20th)

[London] Before British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain presented this year's budget to the House of Commons, the venue was already full, and the public gallery was also overflowing. Among them were nobles, ambassadors from various countries, and high-ranking special envoys. Chancellor Chamberlain kept the contents of the budget strictly secret beforehand. Even his cabinet colleagues only learned about the contents of the budget last night. This was because last year, he informed his cabinet colleagues of the contents of the budget before the 12th, which resulted in a leak of information and caused a great uproar, and Colonial Secretary Thomas had no choice but to resign to take responsibility. This time, Chamberlain had to be particularly cautious.

Chamberlain entered the parliament at 3:42 pm, and the whole venue erupted in applause. Among the audience, there were four former Chancellors of the Exchequer, namely Baldwin, Lloyd George, Churchill, and Horne. When Chamberlain stood up to speak, the whole venue became silent.

Chamberlain first described the past situation and said that from this year onwards, national defense expenditures will continue to occupy a very important position in national finances for several years to come. He then said that the deficit currently known in the budget is £5,597,000, including debt repayment. If national defense expenditures are not included, then the deficit after debt repayment will be £2,250,000, and the debt repayment will be £13,000,000. The amount by which regular revenue exceeds expenditure, not counting debt repayment, is £10,500,000. The revenue from inland taxes, customs duties, and production and sales taxes is as expected. Customs duties and production and sales taxes generated £14,500,000 more than estimated, while income tax, surtax, and inheritance tax generated £5,500,000 less than estimated. According to the Chancellor, inheritance tax is a measure of trade increases and decreases, and it is gratifying that current revenues exceed £29,000,000. The improvement in tax revenues is the result of trade expansion and increased purchasing power. The Exchange Equalization Fund still shows a surplus, so he proposed to retain the old amount of £224,000,000. The Chancellor explained that although there were savings in the civil administration budget, the national defense budget exceeded the estimate by approximately £8,000,000. The total national defense expenditure is £188,600,000, which is approximately £50,000,000 more than last year's total. If the world environment is better now, this amount can be used for debt repayment and other purposes. The Chancellor said that he did not want to include the budget deficit in this year's budget and intended to ask Parliament to find ways to remedy it, as in 1931, 1932, and 1933. Based on the current tax revenue situation, the estimated total tax revenue can reach £847,950,000, so the deficit will be £14,898,000. Last year's expenditure on the highway budget was approximately £25,000,000, and this year it will be £28,500,000. The civil administration budget is a total of £419,000,000, and the national defense budget is a total of £198,000,000, and the additional civil administration budget of £10,000,000 must be added to the national defense expenditure figure, and the proposed debt of £80,000,000 must be removed, along with the debt repayment of £234,000,000. The total amount of expenditure in the budget is £862,848,000. The Chancellor predicted that the good economic situation will continue this year, and the activities of the coronation ceremony will also contribute to this. The Chancellor predicted that customs duties and production and sales taxes are expected to increase by £12,000,000, and income tax, inheritance tax, surtax, and taxes on oil, tobacco, and beef are expected to increase significantly. Although new taxes must be avoided, the new contributions of taxpayers will enable the country to quickly achieve its security goals. The standard rate of income tax will increase by three pence per pound, from four shillings and nine pence to five shillings.

The increase of three pence in income tax can increase revenue by £13,000,000 and lower the deficit to below £2,000,000. The Chancellor announced that a new tax will be applied to those engaged in industry and commerce with annual profits exceeding £2,000. The tax is very complex, starting from one-third of the fixed profit and up to one-fifth. Losses in the past four years will also be included. The Chancellor stated that this tax is a special temporary contribution from the people to national defense, estimated to generate £2,000,000 this year and £20,000,000 to £25,000,000 per year.

### Roosevelt Submits Austerity Plan to Congress

Requests 1.5 Billion Yuan for Relief Work　Advocates Balancing Next Year's Budget

[Washington] President Roosevelt sent a special message to Congress today, revising the original budget proposal for 1937 to 1938, requesting an appropriation of 1.5 billion yuan for relief work. At the same time, the President also proposed an austerity plan and indicated that he would submit another tax bill when the next Congress convenes to make up for the budget shortfall. According to the President's budget proposal in January of this year, the estimated deficit for this year was 2,248,267,774 yuan, and the budget could be balanced next year. The current amendment is for a deficit of 2,557,000,000 yuan this year and a shortfall of 418,000,000 yuan next year. The various heavy taxes that "could have been abolished this spring" will remain in effect, and the President requested that Congress not make additional appropriations outside the budget, as the flood prevention plan currently under discussion by Congress may require excessive funds, and the expenditure on public works should not exceed 500 million yuan per year. The President defended the national defense expenditure, saying that while he is trying to expand the military regardless of bankruptcy, the US budget for this year is still 131.8 million yuan less than the usual 1 billion yuan. (National Telegraph, 20th)

[Washington] President Roosevelt ordered the submission of a revised budget proposal to Congress today, requesting a balanced budget in the next fiscal year and recommending reducing the expenditures of various administrative departments and clearing the assets of various temporary agencies. President Roosevelt also advocated raising funds for relief work. According to the revised budget at the end of the current fiscal year, i.e., June 30, 1937, there is an approximate net shortfall of 2,557 million yuan, an increase of 30.9 million yuan compared to the budget in January. President Roosevelt predicted that income tax revenue in the 1937 fiscal year would be 41 million yuan less than estimated. He does not intend to propose new taxes during this session of Congress. The 1938 budget expenditure will be reduced by 45.7 million yuan, and revenue will increase by 168.2 million yuan, for a net shortfall of approximately 41.8 million yuan.

### The Horror of the Future Great War (Part 2)

— Te

New Scientific Methods of Killing

Regarding defense against aircraft, there is an even more ingenious method: in the wilderness several miles away from the industrial area, a shape resembling an industrial area is laid out. Looking down from the sky, it appears to have railways, waterways, factories, and roads, followed by countryside. The aircraft naturally choose important locations to drop bombs, but they do not know that they are all falling in the wilderness, causing no damage. This involves laying out a double layer of smoke screen over a larger area, with the upper layer being a fake landscape. The British once tested this plan and achieved great results.

An even more formidable method is a levitating machine gun. This is a vertically ascending aircraft with a very small interior, equipped only with a machine cannon and a firing platform. Its manufacturing cost is very low, but it cannot be used for attack because although it ascends very quickly vertically, its horizontal movement is slow and clumsy. Fortunately, its cost is very low, so it can be assembled into a large force. When enemy aircraft come to attack, it can ascend together within a few minutes and engage the enemy aircraft at its flying altitude. The enemy aircraft will find it difficult to win because of the disparity in numbers and the weakness of the guns.

There are many other developments in aircraft construction. German aircraft now mostly use diesel engines because this type of engine does not need to burn gasoline. This is very important for countries lacking oil supply. Is there still a lack of oxygen and the problem of high-altitude cold for stratospheric bombers? But it is still being tested. Flying submarines—or underwater aircraft—are a kind of war equipment that can fly in the sky and move underwater. It can fly into the enemy fleet and fold its wings to do the work of a submarine. A flying tank is a fully equipped tank mounted on an aircraft, flown to a dangerous location on the enemy line, and dropped down. The "parachute brigade" consists of many people carrying parts of cannons, parachuting behind enemy lines, and assembling the cannon parts within minutes to bombard the enemy. This method, especially in the Soviet Union, has been successfully tested.

The "death centrifugal force" weapon was invented by an American and sold to the British. Now Japan is also using it. It is a modernized "David" catapult, adding steel balls on one side, and then many machines rotate as fast as electricity, firing 33,000 rounds per minute. Although it cannot be as accurate as a machine gun, this killing weapon is extremely terrifying when the two armies are close. Another advantage is that it does not use gunpowder or copper.

In land battles, there is also a machine gun used by a single person. This weapon has been used by bandits for a long time. Armor-piercing rifles have also been successful. Tanks that ordinary rifles and machine guns could not resist in the past now have an opponent. Therefore, the new tank army has thickened its armor.

Finally, there are arrow-type torpedoes that rise into the stratosphere and can fly extremely long distances. The post office once tried to use this new weapon to transport mail, but it could not reach far and the landing point was often wrong. The most interesting development is a propaganda aircraft, which is a very large aircraft equipped with radio transceivers, small printing presses, amplifying sound waves, and similar equipment. The Soviet Union now has many of these aircraft, and they can fly into enemy territory and spread propaganda.

In addition, poisonous gas, incendiary bombs, high-explosive bombs, and many killing weapons used in the last war are now fully deployed, ready for slaughter. The military departments of all countries know about these new weapons, and they have almost all prepared them in the same way. Therefore, the next war, no matter how sudden it comes, seems unlikely to be decided in a few hours or a few days. It will inevitably involve protracted warfare, killing until the world is dark. In this kind of war, a country's economic strength and its industrial and financial resources will be the final determining factors for victory or defeat.

### Implementation of Private Loan Registration in Beiping City

Sales permitted after tax supplement, and strict prevention of private goods from overflowing

Beiping Communication: Since the beginning of smuggling by Japanese ruffians and traitors in the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), private goods have been entering the city in a continuous stream, with a great momentum that cannot be stopped. Among them, rayon, sugar, and kerosene are the most numerous, followed by hardware and electrical materials. As a result, all merchants are filled with private goods, piled up like mountains. The Changcheng Branch Office of the Tianjin Customs Administration stationed in Beiping, in order to remedy the situation, sent personnel to inspect various businesses. The measures determined at that time were roughly that all private goods found would be confiscated, and merchants selling private goods would be detained and sent to the court to be sentenced according to the law. However, merchants felt that the inspection was too cumbersome, so they submitted a request to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to devise appropriate measures. Some legitimate merchants, due to the impact of smuggling, suffered heavy losses, and also submitted a request to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce expressing the merchants' sentiment that they were not worried about heavy taxes but about inequality. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, fearing that the delay would lead to bankruptcy of businesses, contacted the Municipal Government and proposed that the Municipal Government, Customs, and Chamber of Commerce jointly form a private goods investigation office, allowing merchants to report and register themselves in order to maintain commerce. After repeated discussions, the Customs believed that this was inappropriate, so the office was not established, and now the proposal has been cancelled. It has been changed to first handle the registration of private goods. The registration procedure is that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will draft a "Inventory Report Form," which includes the business name, address, type of inventory, quantity, etc., and notify all businesses. Those who have private goods in stock will go to the Chamber to collect the report form, fill it out, and send it to their respective trade associations, which will then forward it to the Chamber of Commerce, and then submit it to the Municipal Government. The Municipal Government will notify the Customs Administration stationed in Beiping to send personnel to investigate. Only after the investigation confirms that the inventory matches the report form can it be permitted to supplement taxes and sell. This measure has already begun, but many merchants who sell private goods do not understand the purpose of registration, so they are mostly waiting and watching. As of now, there are very few who have registered, most of them being silk and cloth. As for the registered private goods, the Customs Administration stationed in Beiping has not yet sent personnel to investigate, so various inventories cannot be sold. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce specially appointed members Di Zhanjiang, Gao Luntang, and Sun Baichuan to be responsible for contacting the Customs Administration stationed in Beiping, focusing on the investigation of registered private goods and the future disposal of private goods. Di and others have met with Zhang Yongnian, Deputy Tax Commissioner of the Customs Administration, several times. The results of the talks were quite good. Now Zhang Yongnian has appointed investigators to start investigating registered private goods on the 15th. If the investigation is consistent, they will be allowed to sell first, and then discuss tax supplementation measures. As for merchants who are watching and not registering private goods, the Customs Administration has decided to strictly crack down on them. The method is to intensify inspections. Along the Pingpu Line, the Tianjin General Inspection Office and its various checkpoints have been closely cracking down on smuggling. However, the Pinghan and Pingsui lines lack the establishment of such tax checkpoints and are only being inspected by the railway bureau on behalf of the Customs. Recently, the Tianjin Customs Administration stationed in Beiping, in order to strictly prevent the outflow of private goods, has specially set up checkpoints at the Qianmen West Railway Station, Xizhimen East Railway Station, and Guang'anmen Railway Station, which are the export points of Beiping, and appointed special personnel to be stationed there permanently in order to inspect at any time and prevent the transportation of private goods.

### The Provincial Government of Hubei Province Decides on Joint Public-Private Operation of Inland Waterways

Shipping merchants accuse the provincial government of violating the law and appeal to the Ministry of Communications, and submit a petition to the provincial government to revoke the original decision

Hankou Communication: Before the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), inland waterway shipping in Hubei Province was freely operated by Shanxi merchants, with a total of more than 100 ships. There were as many as dozens of shipping companies, all competing for cargo and causing repeated tragedies. In March of the 23rd year, the then Provincial Governor Zhang Qun forcibly took over all of them for government trusteeship to implement shipping control, with a one-year term. If the reorganization was perfect, they would still be returned to private operation. The following year, the provincial government formulated a five-year reorganization plan and established the Inland Waterway Shipping Administration Bureau to take charge. The merchants, in order to fight for property rights, repeatedly petitioned the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications, proposing several minimum requirements. The Ministry of Communications agreed to consult with the provincial government on the issues of increasing monthly interest, issuing depreciation fees, and providing relief to the unemployed in order to resolve disputes. This case was delayed and unresolved. On March 16 of this year, the 233rd meeting of the provincial government again passed a resolution to change the method of reorganizing inland waterway shipping, deciding on a joint public-private operation, merging the existing shipping agencies and reorganizing them into the Hubei Provincial Shipping Bureau in order to concentrate management and operation. The private share portion would be replaced by the current merchant-owned ships at a price, accounting for 40% of the total amount. The government share portion, in addition to the government-owned ships, would also be added with cash, accounting for 60% of the total amount. It is said that the official capital would be valued from Hanyeping tugboats and the Wuhan Ferry Wuchang Machine Factory. The merchants were greatly disturbed upon hearing this and appointed Zhang Guoen, Xie Shengkan, and Peng Qingyan as representatives to accuse the Hubei Provincial Government of violating the law and appealed to the Ministry of Communications, requesting the revocation of the original decision. The reasons are: ㊀ Regardless of whether it is a partnership or a company, according to the law, the consent of the partners or shareholders should be obtained. There is no reason to force participation. Officials should be on an equal footing with the people in private rights. If personal property is arbitrarily allocated by officials, then the civil law that guarantees private rights in the country is equal to a mere formality, and the survival of the people and social security are both affected. The Hubei Provincial Government's forced trusteeship of merchant ships "has the suspicion of infringing on private rights. However, the nominal property rights still belong to the merchants. Now they are forced to recognize shares at a price, turning the actual property rights into uncertain shares, which is a disguised confiscation, let alone having a legal basis. ㊁ The Hanyeping tugboats that the provincial government intends to use as official shares are over 50 years old and cannot be used. In addition, the tugboats with shallower drafts are almost completely decayed due to the thinness of the hull and the long years. The remaining ones have thicker hulls and very deep drafts, making it difficult to navigate the inland rivers. If they are converted into lighters, they are all over 1,000 tons, exceeding the water surface number. There is a world of difference between them and the small inland ships. It is not feasible to adapt to the situation by cutting one's feet to fit the shoes. The merchants also submitted a copy of the appeal to the provincial government for supervision and review, stating: "We have learned that the 233rd meeting of Your Government on March 16 of this year passed a resolution to change the method of reorganizing inland waterway shipping, deciding on a joint public-private operation. We are extremely disturbed and have repeatedly submitted petitions, explaining the reasons why we cannot comply with the resolution, and respectfully asking for the withdrawal of the order. We have not received a reply to this day. We have been forced to appeal to the competent Ministry of Communications on the 13th of this month in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 3 of the Appeal Law. We know that Your Government attaches importance to the people's suffering and cares about their well-being. Even if the decision is biased, there will be no prejudice in the aftermath. However, our industries are affected and the interests are closely related, so we cannot remain silent. We have to tie the bell to untie it, and the right is exclusive. After all, it is not enough to rely on Your Government to show special benevolence to comfort our expectations. Article 7, Paragraph 1 of the Appeal Law states that in addition to the appeal petition, the appellant shall also prepare a copy and send it to the official residence that made the original decision. Article 2 of the same article states that if the original decision-making authority considers the appeal to be reasonable, it may withdraw the original decision and report it to the authority that accepted the appeal. We are in accordance with the above regulations and submitting a copy of the appeal petition. We respectfully ask Your Government to supervise and review and approve the revocation of the original decision in order to relieve the difficulties of the merchants and provide real benefits." (April 19)

### The Truth About Lin Wenfeng's Death in Shantou

Medical autopsy confirms death from illness; certain parties hope to create a second Kakuta case

Shantou News: The so-called Taiwanese doctor Lin Wenfeng (whose household registration report claims to be from Raoping) died of illness in Anbu, Chao'an. The Japanese Consul stationed in Shantou actually said that the deceased died suddenly and requested our authorities to conduct an autopsy at the Bo'ai Hospital, hoping to create a second Kakuta case. However, our standing authorities refused the Japanese Consul's request because the Chao'an authorities and the Shantou Municipal authorities had successively sent doctors to Anbu to examine and confirm that the deceased had died of illness and transported the body to Shantou. However, the Japanese Consul still went to extremes and secretly telegraphed to request the dispatch of a warship to Shantou, wanting to use force as a diplomatic backing. Now, two doctors each from China and Japan, together with Dr. Holder, the president of the Gospel Hospital run by the British Church, will conduct an autopsy, and Dr. Holder will preside over the autopsy. With the consent of both parties, it was held at the Gospel Hospital on the evening of the 8th. The details are as follows:

After the Chinese and Japanese sides reached an agreement, the members of the Cunxin Shantang transported the deceased's body to the autopsy room of the Gospel Hospital. The Japanese Consul accompanied his secretary Obata and two doctors from the Bo'ai Hospital. Our side also sent Municipal Government Counselors Huang Jing and Mai Yingjun, as well as police medical officer Li Xixiang, court medical officers, etc. to the scene for inspection. At exactly 12:00 that evening, the English doctor Holder and several assistants began to work, first dissecting the abdomen and examining the large and small intestines and bones to prove that there were no signs of poisoning or bruises. Then they examined the lungs, and both lungs were completely ulcerated, confirming that he died of tuberculosis. The Chinese and Japanese doctors present also conducted a detailed study and confirmed that he had died of illness. However, in order to be cautious, the internal organs of Lin's abdomen were cut off and divided into two parts. One was handed over to our side to be sent to the Shanghai Fada Hospital for research, and the other was handed over to the Japanese side to be sent back to Tokyo, Japan for research. The scheduled research period is one month. The Chinese, English, and Japanese doctors signed the diagnosis and examination report. At 2:00 in the morning, with the consent of both the Chinese and Japanese sides, the body was still handed over to the Cunxin Shantang for encoffining and sealing, and the Japanese Consul was instructed to have his family claim it for burial. However, on the 9th, the coffin was still parked at the Taiping office of the Cunxin Shantang, and his family had not yet claimed it. According to the autopsy, the truth of the case is clear, and it is evident that the Japanese Consul's excuse to create an invasion incident is only a futile effort.

It is found that Lin Wenfeng went from Shantou to Anbu in the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935) and established the Changan Pharmacy inside Gongyangmen. When reporting to the district, he said that he was from Raoping. Since its establishment, the business has been quite good. However, Lin himself suffered from lung disease, and he coughed every night until morning. The neighbors all knew this. On the night of the 3rd of this month, Lin acted as usual, took a walk, and returned to the pharmacy to sleep. At about 4:00, the pharmacy's handyman suddenly heard a sound like a cow panting, and then it stopped. At first, he didn't pay attention to it. But the next morning (the 4th), when he tried to wake him up, he was already stiff. Therefore, it is confirmed that Lin Wenfeng is indeed from Raoping. The fact that the Japanese side intended to falsely claim him is already obvious. Therefore, it has been decided to refute the unreasonable disturbance of the Japanese Consul this time, and to telegraph to the Provincial Government to transfer the message to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to notify the Japanese Embassy, requesting them to instruct the Japanese Consuls in various places not to create something out of nothing and falsely claim the nationality of the people, creating unnecessary complications, in order to promote Sino-Japanese friendship.

The Construction Bureau has issued a notice to residents and shops on Northwest Street, Lindun Road, Shiquan Street, Shizi Street, Weiqian Street, Qian Street, Fenghuang Street, and Hulong Street to demolish and vacate their houses by May 31. Overdue houses will be forcibly demolished. Construction will begin on June 16 and is scheduled to be completed before Double Tenth Day.

### Wuxi

Compensation for Equipment and Business Rights

The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce, according to Cai Jiansan and other shareholders of the former Wuxi-run Yaoming Company who held shares, claimed that they saw in the newspaper that the National Government Construction Committee planned to recruit merchant shares to develop the electricity and mining business, and the Qishuyan Changzhou Factory was also on the list. It is said that the Central Political Committee has passed the proposal and it will soon become a reality. However, the entire business of the Qishuyan Power Plant in Wuxi was originally operated by the former merchant-run Yaoming Company, and it was also registered and granted a special business license and issued shares by the Ministry. Later, in the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927), it was taken over by the government. The former person in charge of the former merchant-run Yaoming Company has repeatedly requested negotiations regarding the electric light poles, lines, all equipment, and business rights, but no conclusion has been reached and the shareholders' losses have been uncompensated. Now, it is heard that merchant shares are being opened up and investment in enterprise development is being promoted. How should the original investment of the former merchant-run Yaoming Company in the Qishuyan Power Plant be concluded? Or should it be re-evaluated and compensated? It is requested to be clearly indicated for handling. The Chamber of Commerce stated that it had specially telegraphed the Construction Committee to ask how the investments and debts of each shareholder should be evaluated and compensated, and to clarify and maintain the credit of merchant shares.

Robber?? Kills Person Under Xiao Bridge

Under the Xiao Bridge on the East Outer Henan Street, yesterday (20th) at about 4:00 in the morning, a bran boat was parked when suddenly a robber came. Dressed in a gray uniform, claiming to be calling a boat to load rice, he lured the bran vendor Wang Quanyun to the southeast corner of the city and, with three other robbers lying in wait, robbed him of 10 yuan in legal currency. Quanyun resisted, causing the robbers to use knives to slash him eight times, resulting in a lot of bleeding and very serious head injuries. Later, the boatman Zhao Bingquan learned of the incident and sent the injured man to the Gospel Hospital for treatment. His life is feared to be in danger.

Kang Suheng was detained on the 20th and investigated by Prosecutor Liu. The poison cakes were sent to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for chemical examination. Kang was released on bail.

### National Industry in Shanxi (Part 1)

— Xu Yi-wu

General Industrial Overview

In the 21st year of the Republic of China, the Taiyuan Arsenal in Shanxi was reorganized into a part of the Northwest Industrial Corporation's machine factory. Agricultural machinery factories, paper mills, locomotive factories – all the machinery needed within the province was available. Not only could it supply the needs of all counties in the province, but the light industrial machinery of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia provinces also relied on it. Regarding textile factories, both weaving mills in Taiyuan and Yuci had large-scale factories. The clothing of the people of Shanxi was almost entirely purchased from products of the province. With the development of light industry within the province, goods from outside encountered a barrier. With the foundation of national industry established, there was hope of resolving the people's livelihood issues.

Shanxi is the province richest in coal and iron production in our country. Coal and iron are the main raw materials for industry and can be said to be the engine of both light and heavy industry. With these two industrial raw materials, Shanxi could undertake any kind of production enterprise. As far as I know, the industries operated by the Shanxi provincial government include the following:

Steel mills are the foundation of heavy industry. The steel mill in Shanxi was founded with a small capital of only 200,000 yuan. Now the factory buildings and internal machinery have been completely built. It is not yet known which aspect the future products will focus on. If it needs to focus on military industry, then the steel mill can take on a very large task. The scale of the iron factory is very large. In addition to agricultural and industrial machinery parts, it also has a locomotive factory attached. Passenger and freight cars for the Datong-Pukou Railway are all products of the factory. The weaving factory has 40 woolen looms and 120 cotton looms, with over 1,300 employees. Its products include woolen broadcloth, blankets, serge, coarse and fine cloth, towels, and over 40 kinds of daily-use cotton textiles. Woolen products sell for only 30 to 70 cents per foot, and cotton products sell for only 8 cents to 16 cents per foot. These inexpensive items are nevertheless sturdy, plain, and presentable. The people of Shanxi have always valued frugality, and the manufacturer's products are able to cater to this mentality. This not only brings profits in business but also makes it impossible for imported goods to be sold. The Jinhua Tobacco Company produces more than ten kinds of cigarettes, such as Wutaishan and Yungang. Although the packaging is not very beautiful, and the method of making tobacco silk is not considered good, the spirit of the people of Shanxi promoting local goods means that even for a cigarette, they will only smoke local products. I have visited the Shanxi Provincial Government Standing Committee and wealthy merchants. They entertained guests with Yungang brand cigarettes. A Chamber of Commerce committee member told me: "Before Shanxi had cigarette production, we smoked local dried tobacco and water pipe tobacco. It was not until Jinhua Company had cigarette production that we had the habit of smoking paper cigarettes. Now the company's products are also following the trend of promoting local goods and are widely sold. In the cigarette markets of Suiyuan and Ningxia, Jinhua Company occupies the second place in sales. Our idea is: everyone likes to smoke cigarettes, and this province must have this production, otherwise, the annual outflow of funds would be considerable. Moreover, we also want to recover the outflow of profits from the northwestern provinces. I remember when the company first launched cigarettes, everyone thought the taste was not good and did not buy them much. Later, the provincial government ordered all counties to first promote purchasing and smoking among civil servants, so the public enthusiastically promoted sales, paying as much attention as to other official orders. How can the people not be moved by this spirit of leading by example from the local authorities in the province?” The Jinjiang Paper Mill, although not large in scale, produces everything. Newsprint and one-sided glossy paper are very low in price. In addition to supplying the use of various agencies in the provincial capital, it is also gradually promoting sales to various counties. Taiyuan's newspapers, such as Jinyang, Taiyuan, and Shanxi, all purchase one-sided glossy paper from Jinlong. Although they feel it is inconvenient for printing, they do not therefore purchase Japanese goods.

Production and Sales Methods

The production situation of various manufacturers in Taiyuan is roughly as described above. I will now introduce their sales situation: There is a local products emporium in Taiyuan, which everyone knows. This emporium was only opened in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. Internally, it is organized with business, accounting, and general affairs departments under the manager. The person in charge of the business department is a businessman with considerable commercial experience in Taiyuan. The personnel of the accounting department are cadres from the Suiyuan Economic Office. The main task of the general affairs department is public relations. The personnel in this department are generally very familiar with the situation in other provinces. Regarding commercial contacts, they have achieved close ties in Shanghai, Peiping, and Tianjin. The retail section of the business department is divided into cloth, leather goods, stationery, cigarettes, agricultural and industrial equipment, flour, and other departments. The display is well-organized, and the store clerks are more attentive than those in the national goods companies in major commercial ports. The local products emporium has 47 distribution points throughout the province. Branch offices have been established in major domestic commercial ports, and special salesmen have been specially hired by various railway bureaus and shipping companies. With such a sound organization and sales techniques, the local products emporium has made the following progress in recent years: In the 24th year of the Republic of China, the turnover was 402,800 yuan. In the first half of the 25th year, it was over 510,000 yuan, and in the second half, it was 1,080,000 yuan. The profits increase at a geometric rate of 15%. The distribution of profits is as follows: 15% for the reserve fund, 15% for employee bonuses, 15% for shareholder dividends, and the remaining 20% is used to subsidize various public undertakings.

### Gleanings from the Journey to Yunnan (3)

— Bei Xuan

Day 7 (April 21st): Everyone was divided into groups for inspection. I was assigned to the group examining courts, prisons, social education, and relief efforts. I followed Professor Wu Zelin and the executive committee member Tong Xing to the High Court first. The court was the old county government, with 60 acres of land and hundreds of rooms, most of which were dilapidated. In the West Garden, there was an ancient well from the Ming Dynasty and a 300-year-old pomegranate tree. Beside the court, there was a portrait of the first-generation Zhang Tianshi painted by a Taoist named Jingfan, carved very well, dating from the 12th year of the Luo Zheng era. A large plaque hung in the hall, with the words "Enforcing the Law" written by the investigating censor Wu Xiangkun in the 13th year of the Wanli era, the calligraphy vigorous and lush. Court President Liang Jun described the general situation of the Jiangxi courts in a very organized manner. Jiangxi has four High Branch Courts: "Ganxian, Jiujiang, Ji'an, Hekou," and five Local Branch Courts: "Nanchang, Linchuan, Fuliang, Poyang, Yuan Yi." The Nanchang First Prison's buildings are old and can only accommodate 300 people. A new prison is being built in Jinxian County that can accommodate 1,000 people. The No. 2 prison in Jiujiang can accommodate 500 people. Currently, one-third of the prisoners in each prison are military personnel and those detained by the anti-smoking agencies. We then went to the First Prison. Although the buildings were old, the air and light were sufficient, and the management was still legal. In addition to drug addicts, most of the prisoners were convicted of robbery and murder. Political prisoners also accounted for two-tenths, mostly ignorant people from various counties who were affiliated with the Communists. There were dozens of female prisoners, also mostly convicted of robbery and murder. Among the political prisoners, there was "Miao Min," 26 years old, from Yiyang, the wife of the Communist leader Fang Zhimin. She was a high school graduate. After Fang was captured, Miao still led her troops and fought against the army for more than two years before being captured. She was sentenced to life imprisonment, spared the death penalty. After entering prison, Miao showed remorse and enthusiastically took on the responsibility of writing letters and prison education among the female prisoners, working tirelessly. This shows that capable people, even in prison, still occupy a leadership position. When we saw her, Miao was holding the "Eastern Miscellany" magazine. Miao was tall and very beautiful, wearing a very crisp light purple cheongsam. The six female prisoners in the same cell were all neatly dressed. Fang had three children. At first, they were allowed to accompany their mother in prison, but later permission was denied because the sentence was too long. Other female prisoners had children aged three or four living with them in prison, as there was no way to foster them, so they had to take care of them themselves. Miao has been in prison for three years. If she spends seven years, she may be eligible for the Reflection Regulations and have a chance to see the light of day again.

Nanchang has seven major newspapers and four minor newspapers. After we arrived, one newspaper simultaneously published the crimes of the assassinated Director Cheng Shiwei, doing its best to be harsh. It seemed that someone was deliberately exposing it. On the evening of the news, Zhong and Xiong were taken away by the police, but were released shortly after. We were on a tour, and did not have time to worry about the local grievances. I only felt that using the newspaper as a tool for private attacks and venting anger is a social evil. If there is something to report, it can be brought to court. Those under attack can also file a lawsuit in the civil court. Now, abusing police power to arrest people is also a lack of judgment, and all the methods are wrong. Therefore, what person who has been "fired up" is the most uneconomical.

In the afternoon, the group, together with Wei Tingsheng and Zhuan Shi, gave a lecture on finance at the Education Department, which was very exciting. Zhang Shiwei gave a lecture on the test run of vegetable oil cars, which was also of interest to the audience. At Shen Shi (3-5 PM), Chairman Xiong Tianyi invited everyone to a tea party at his residence. Xiong paid great attention to "vocational education" and had already asked Huang Renzhi to jointly draft a plan. He is currently soliciting vocational education methods from Germany for implementation. As for the "Recent Overview of Jiangxi Administration" published by Xiong, it was something he said to his colleagues on the first day. Fearing that the records would be inconsistent, he revised a draft and had it mimeographed and distributed. All the information can be cross-referenced in the "Jiangxi Yearbook of the 25th Year." The colleagues were satisfied with Jiangxi's post-bandit recovery and other construction, especially the popularity of youth education, which is worthy of praise. Xiong and Gong Xuesui, Director of the Construction Department, and Wang Cifu, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, did not talk about officialdom but only did practical work, implementing various measures persistently. Although some people say that it has not fully conformed to the party's guiding principles, it is still overly harsh because it is good to see those who are constant after the chaos of Jiangxi soldiers.

Day 8 (April 12th): We departed from Nanchang to Xishan Wanshou Palace. The palace is dedicated to Xu Xun of the Jin Dynasty. In the late Qing Dynasty, when various places established hometown associations, it was often difficult for the government to approve them. The Jiangxi merchants in various places used the name of Wanshou Palace, which had been built under imperial order, so the Jiangxi Guildhalls in various places all operated under the name of Wanshou Palace (like the Tianfei Palace in Fujian). This place is the headquarters of Wanshou Palace, with many ancient cypresses, and thousands of people come to the temple from all over the province every year on the first day of August to pay their respects. The place has become a market. During the Communist Party's time in Jiangxi, the people who came to offer incense were not strictly prohibited, which shows the depth of the people of Jiangxi's superstition in Taoism.

At noon, we arrived in Gao'an County, which is divided into two cities, spanning the Jinjiang River. The north city is denser, and the south region is slightly more relaxed. There is an ancient bridge in Gao'an, over 300 feet long, with solid stonework, which shows the scale of the project at that time. Although the Gao'an Normal School has simple facilities, it is rich in educational spirit. The walls of Yucai Elementary School are made of black cement, with bulletin boards. This method can be emulated by all parties. We see bulletin boards posted everywhere, with rotten paper flying, graffiti, and graffiti, like slogans, which hinder the market's customers. There has never been a method of coating the walls with cement and writing with chalk, which is both economical and good-looking. Dongdou in Gao'an is the Yunqiao Gate, commemorating He Jian's army as the first to enter the city.

### Consul Lei Weiting Resident in South Africa Talks About

Key Points for Developing South African Commerce

According to Shenzhou News Agency, Lei Weiting, the consul resident in South Africa, returned to the country to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and went to various places in the country for inspection. He arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. A reporter from Shenzhou News Agency specially visited Lei at his residence yesterday to inquire about the recent situation of overseas Chinese affairs and commerce in South Africa. The conversation was very detailed. The main points are recorded as follows:

Overseas Chinese Must Unite Effectively

According to Lei, there are about 3,000 overseas Chinese in South Africa, mostly from Guangdong. Most of those who went there in the beginning worked, but now many are engaged in business, mainly grocery stores, clothing stores, and vegetable gardens. In particular, there are more stores selling daily necessities such as canned food and medicinal oil. The first overseas Chinese went to South Africa around 1885. Later, the South African Federal Government promulgated the Gold Act, prohibiting people of color from living and owning property in the gold mining area. According to the harsh regulations repeatedly enacted by South Africa, the target is not the overseas Chinese but the Indians, because there are now a large number of Indians in South Africa. However, the harsh regulations restricting Asians and people of color have involved Chinese people. In the past, during the tenure of Consul-General He Ji, discussions were held with the South African side to establish a gentleman's agreement. At the verge of success, it was unfortunately destroyed by the conspiracy of a few illegal people, which is a pity. Now, the Federal Government has also enacted new regulations on the renting of residences by Asians. In addition to this being handled by the government, what should be noted is that our overseas Chinese must strive for unity among themselves and should not destroy each other, because being in a foreign land is like sharing one life. At the same time, they should pay more attention to cleanliness, hygiene, and the cultivation of all knowledge.

Key Points for Developing the South African Market

As for the future prospects of South African commerce, the future is still bright. Chinese people have opened about 800 stores, and the business is still good. South Africa has ten million people, and there are seven million natives there. The natives still habitually use Chinese goods, but transportation between here and South Africa is inconvenient, and not many domestic goods have been shipped there in the past. In the future, we should find ways to communicate. South Africa does not have much industrial production, and most of the things used are imported from foreign countries, so there is hope for our domestic goods to be sold there. However, what must be noted is: (1) To cater to white people, household items such as carpets should be of high quality, beautiful colors, and prices should not matter, because the white people living in South Africa are all wealthy and like to use high-quality goods. (2) For goods suitable for the general population, attention must be paid to their low prices. If domestic goods can be cheaper than those from other countries, the sales will be wide, otherwise it will be difficult to receive the patronage of most of the natives.

### New US High Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

Will Take the Original Ship to the Philippines This Morning. Talks on Philippine Independence Must First Solve the Economy

After the former commissioner of the United States to the Philippines (i.e., the nature of the former governor), Mr. Murphy, returned to the country and was elected governor of Michigan, the government of the country appointed Mr. Paul Vories McNutt to succeed him. Mr. McNutt arrived in Shanghai at 12:15 p.m. yesterday by the Dollar Line's President Hoover. He will take the original ship to the Philippines at 6 a.m. this morning. Details are as follows:

Situation Upon Arrival in Shanghai

The ship docked at Yangshupu No. 11 and No. 12 pontoon. US Ambassador to China Johnson, US Attorney General to China Hillmic, Consul General to Shanghai Goss, and Shanghai Acting Mayor Yu Hongjun's representative Tang Shixuan, and many other Americans and Filipinos living in Shanghai went to the ship to welcome him. After landing, McNutt went to Hillmic's residence to rest and attended Hill's luncheon. He returned to the original ship that night and continued on to the United States at 6 a.m. this morning.

Accompanying Personnel

In addition to his wife and daughter, those traveling with McNutt included Colonel Ross and his wife, McNutt's personal secretary Hyde and his wife, legal adviser Cardin and his wife, administrative assistant Gao and his wife, accountant Du Baishi and his wife, and female secretary Kona Keyes, totaling more than ten people.

Remarks

McNutt told reporters that he had no specific plans for the administration of the Philippines because he had not yet seen the actual situation on the island. Regarding the realization of Philippine independence in 1939, this depends on the results of the negotiations between the joint committee of American and Philippine economic experts on the future economic problems between the United States and the Philippines. After all, political freedom is meaningless if the economy cannot be independent. In short, economic problems must be solved first. The United States always considers the interests of the Philippines and hopes that it can become independent as soon as possible.

McNutt's Brief Biography

McNutt is from Indiana, USA, and is 46 years old. He graduated from Indiana University and initially practiced law. He then served as an assistant professor at the Indiana University School of Law. He then entered the military and rose from captain to colonel. In 1922, he was elected commander of the National Guard Infantry. In 1933, he became the governor of Indiana and also won the right to run for president. McNutt's appointment to the Philippines was welcomed by the people of the Philippines. He had previously met with Philippine President Quezon in Washington to discuss trade issues between the United States and the Philippines.

### Kawagoe Left Nanjing for the Soviet Union This Morning for a Tour

Will Come to Shanghai from the Soviet Union

According to the Central News Agency, Japanese Ambassador to China Kawagoe is scheduled to return to his country on the Nagasaki Maru on the 2nd of next month with his wife and others to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Therefore, he is scheduled to come to Shanghai from Nanjing by train this morning (22nd). Because he admires the scenic spots of Suzhou, he will stay for a short time in Suzhou to tour. The next day, he will take a car from Suzhou to Shanghai to meet the new Japanese Consul-General in Nanjing, Hidaka. It is heard that Hidaka will arrive in Shanghai on the 28th. As for the rumors that Kawagoe will no longer come to China after returning to his country, it is said to be speculation.

### Yunfei Motor Company Drivers Went on Strike Last Night

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, 300 drivers and workers of the American-owned Yunfei Motor Company opposed the dismissal of worker representative Zhang Daxin.

They are scheduled to petition the municipal party department and social affairs bureau this morning.

### News on the British Tramway Strike Yesterday

The Party and Government Agreed on Two Measures. Mr. Du Yuesheng Will Mediate Today

According to Dagong News Agency, after all the car and machine workers of the British-owned Shanghai Tramway Company in the Public Concession jointly went on strike on the 18th of this month, the problem has not been resolved due to the insistence of both labor and management. The municipal party and government authorities held a discussion meeting at the municipal party headquarters conference room at 10 a.m. yesterday to discuss a solution. The attendees included Wu Kaixian, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Party Department, Jiang Huaisu, Secretary-General, Zhou Funong, Chief of the Civil Movement Section, Zhang Sheng, Director of the Labor and Peasant Stock, Lu Sachu, Yu Yaoqiu, Wang Xianqing, Director of the Mediation Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhu Jintao, a staff member of the Third Section. After the meeting, two measures were decided: (1) Persuade the workers to resume work immediately, and the party and government authorities will be responsible for mediating the issue of treatment conditions. (2) The party and government authorities will inform the Shanghai Tramway Company to convene a board of directors immediately and accept the workers' minimum requirements.

Persuade to Resume Work

After the party and government authorities jointly decided on the handling measures, the municipal party department sent Lu Yinchu, Yu Yaoqiu, Yu Xianqing, Zhu Jintao from the Social Affairs Bureau, and Gong Yuting from the General Labor Union to gather Yang Zhaoyu and Yang Bochu, representatives of the ticket sellers, Li Lansheng, representative of the drivers, and Ge Shixin, representative of the machine workers, at the Zhabei Club to persuade them to resume work first. The party and government authorities were responsible for mediating the issue of requirements. In order to comply with the orders of the party and government, the worker representatives fully accepted the decided measures and promised to set off immediately to persuade the workers in various departments to resume work. It is hoped that work can resume tomorrow morning.

Visiting Du for Assistance

Yesterday afternoon at 5 o'clock, representatives Yang Zhaoyu, Yang Bochu, Li Lansheng, Ge Shixin, and Yan Yongqing and others presented a letter to Mr. Du Yuesheng at Du's residence in the French Concession, requesting assistance. Du personally received them and promised to take on the mediation.

Mediation in Progress

After the president of the local association, Du Yuesheng, received the workers' request for assistance, he believed that the matter concerned public transportation and should not be delayed, so he first called the company's Chinese agent Hu Ziyu to talk to him yesterday afternoon at 6 o'clock and scheduled to visit the company at 10 o'clock this morning to meet with the persons in charge of the board of directors and conduct mediation.

Minimum Conditions

The workers have now put forward four conditions for resuming work: (1) Drivers who work 25 days a month will receive one day's additional subsidy (totaling two days including the previous two days). (2) Machine workers will receive two days' additional subsidy per month. (3) Half of the wages will be reissued for the strike period at the Jing'an Temple Road and Huishan Road machine factories. (4) Wages will be paid as usual during the strike period, and workers must not be dismissed on any pretext.

Hope to Resume Work

A reporter from Dagong News Agency inquired with the party and government authorities yesterday.

It is learned that after deciding on these measures to handle the tramway strike, on the one hand, personnel were sent to persuade the workers to resume work first, and on the other hand, the Shanghai Tramway Company was notified to convene a board of directors immediately to accept the workers' minimum requirements. Therefore, the strike can be resolved without delay. Inquiring with the workers, they expressed acceptance of the measures decided by the party and government authorities, but the company must first acknowledge the minimum conditions before they can resume work. The issue of conditions is now being mediated by Du Yuesheng. He will consult with the company this morning to find a solution. If the issue of conditions is resolved today, all workers should be able to resume work as usual tomorrow morning, and the trams on all roads in the concession should be able to resume operation.

Company Losses

A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned yesterday that the company has a total of 109 trolleybuses and 307 trams (locomotives and trailers). Each trolleybus generates approximately 70 yuan in business revenue per day, with approximately 7 yuan in expenses excluding electricity. Each tram generates approximately 110 yuan in revenue per day, with approximately 2 yuan in expenses. The total daily loss amounts to 40,023 yuan. In addition, it must compensate the French Water and Electricity Company 5,000 yuan per day according to the contract. The company's losses are estimated to reach 180,000 yuan after four days of the workers' strike.

### Public Benefit Cotton Mill Labor Dispute Reaches Stalemate

Workers Refuse to Re-register

According to the New Voice News Agency, the strike at the Public Benefit Cotton Mill, located at 150 Robison Road in West Shanghai, was called for mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau the day before yesterday. However, due to the absence of the management, no results were achieved. As the eight improved treatment conditions demanded by the workers have not been resolved, a general meeting of all workers was originally scheduled for 1:00 PM yesterday at the exercise field of the Wo Kung Primary School to discuss ways forward and elect representatives to go to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Industry. However, due to rain, it was rescheduled to be held this afternoon. At the same time, the factory re-issued a notice deciding to re-register all workers. All workers, being in the middle of the mediation period, were unwilling to accept the registration and therefore refused it collectively. It is reported that the Social Affairs Bureau has decided to submit the case to the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee for arbitration according to the law.

### Silk Weaving Factory Workers Petitioned Yesterday

Demanding Factories Fulfill Conditions

According to the New Voice News Agency, silk weaving factory workers declared a strike against silk weaving factories that failed to fulfill the Social Affairs Bureau's ruling. These factories include: ⑴ Shanghai Weaving Factory on Kalou Road, ⑵ Zhenye Factory on Bei’er Road, ⑶ Shenyi Factory in Sanyi Lane, Huasheng Road, ⑷ Tianhua Factory on Huade Road, ⑸ Shili Xin Factory on Huade Road, ⑹ Weicheng Factory in Anle Lane, ⑺ Zhengxin Factory on Huade Road, ⑻ Tianxin Factory on Huade Road, and ⑼ Fuli Factory on Huade Road. Workers from the above factories have formed a weaving strike delegation to petition the Social Affairs Bureau, demanding that the factories be ordered to fulfill the Social Affairs Bureau's ruling as soon as possible, with the most important being the actual measurement in meters and a 10% wage increase for universal labor. According to a survey conducted yesterday by the Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Union, the factories that have implemented the actual measurement in meters include Yulun, Guanghua, Weiwen, Xiefeng, Tao Ji, Yuhou, Dao Hua, Hongda, and dozens of others. Those who have universally increased wages by 10% and also actually measured in meters include Hengfeng, Daxin, Hui Xia Sheng Ji, Nanyang, Xiehe, Meili, Yingyu Jinsheng Chengji, Yongye, and a dozen others. In addition, workers at the Damei Silk Factory in West Shanghai resumed work the day before yesterday, and the factory has agreed to pay wages for the day off on the Huanghuagang Memorial Day.

### Hua Nan Company General Manager Chen Bozhuang Assumed Office Yesterday

After the establishment of the Hua Nan Rice Industry Company, the head office was located at Room 303, Guangdong Bank Building, Jiangsi Road.

The company's organization is divided into business, accounting, secretarial, and management departments, and personnel will be selected and organized in order.

### Singapore China National Products Exhibition Hall Established

Welcoming All Manufacturers to Participate

The Singapore China National Products Exhibition Hall, organized by the China Industrial Overseas Trade Association of this city, has been formally established. A board of directors has been organized, and the following seven companies have been selected as directors: Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory, Family Industrial Cooperative, Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory, Wuhe Weaving Factory, Bank of China, and Tianchu MSG Factory. The Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory, Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, and Bank of China were mutually elected as standing directors. All participating manufacturers should pay an establishment fee of 300 national currency. The address of the exhibition hall is on the second floor of the Bank of China on Sisi Street, Singapore, which is the center of the bustling city. In addition to displaying various domestic products, the exhibition hall also has experts in charge. Manufacturers can entrust the exhibition hall to promote sales, introduce banks to handle remittance procedures, and obtain various information about Nanyang. It is a good opportunity for domestic manufacturers to develop overseas trade. The Shanghai office is located in the China Industrial Overseas Trade Association in the Mainland Commercial Building, telephone number 94749. Manufacturers who have not participated are welcome to contact and participate. After the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group from our country went to Nanyang, overseas Chinese and foreign businessmen in various parts of Nanyang have a considerable understanding of domestic goods and hold sincere hopes. It is a pity that there is no overall mobilizing agency, so there is no way to develop. Now that the Singapore Exhibition Hall has been established, it will not be difficult to promote domestic goods in Nanyang in the future.

### Local Association Requests That Gaoqiao Be a Self-Government Experiment Zone

Du Yuesheng's Letter to Acting Mayor Yu

Du Yong, the president of the Local Association of this city, wrote to Acting Mayor Yu to request the takeover of the Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association in Pudong and the trial implementation of a local self-government experimental zone. The letter stated, "Respected Sir, Our association founded the Rural Improvement Association in Gaoqiao, Pudong in July of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, and the plan was divided into four main categories: village governance, education, production, and security. Experts and enthusiastic local individuals were invited to be members, responsible for planning everything. The required funds were raised by Yong and others, and the term was set for three years, after which it would be handed over to the local government for takeover. At the beginning of the establishment, a letter was sent to the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government for the record. Fortunately, with the guidance of the party and government organs, we have been able to implement it step by step according to the original plan, such as repairing roads and building bridges, spending more than 10,000 yuan, all donated by enthusiastic local individuals. Group weddings have been held twice, with nearly 1,000 spectators each time. Three primary schools have been run independently, assisting the government in carrying out literacy education campaigns, civic training, labor service, and anti-smoking propaganda. Using the four seasons, public entertainment was held and a production mutual aid society was established. More than 10,000 yuan has been lent out, and all have been recovered on time, ensuring credibility. Recently, more than 30 cooperatives have been organized, and the Bank of China has been requested to lend 10,000 yuan. Two nurseries have been set up for year-round care, and temporary ones have also been set up twice during the busy farming season, accommodating more than 200 children. Improved seeds are used and side businesses are promoted. In a small-scale experiment, sanitation work is completely carried out in cooperation with the health office, and it has already taken shape and achieved initial results. Considerable connections have been made with local leaders, ambitious young people, and enthusiastic comrades abroad. As of June of this year, the three-year term has expired, and a total of more than 20,000 yuan has been spent. We want to continue, but we are suffering from exhausted finances. Transferring it to the local government is also feared to be beyond our capabilities. I have heard that the mayor has announced the policy of selecting a suitable location for a self-government experimental zone and gradually promoting it to the entire city. I am extremely admired. I am using this opportunity to inform you of the Gaoqiao Improvement Association that our association has established. I hope that you will send someone to investigate and approve the takeover, so that the three years of management of our association will not be in danger of being abandoned, and the germination of self-government in Gaoqiao can advance to the city of prosperity. If you have any questions, please let me know immediately. The Director-General, Mr. Wang Kuizheng, can be received to present everything in person. I am extremely grateful and await your approval for compliance."

### Twenty-one Christian Organizations Held a Farewell Reception for Ambassador Gan

Held at the YMCA the Night Before Last

The National Christian Council of China, the National Association of YMCAs, the Chinese Bible Society, the YWCA, the Chinese Christian Education Association, the East China Christian Education Association, the Guangju Association, the Shanghai YMCA, the Shanghai YWCA, the Shanghai Branch of the International YWCA, St. John's University, the Women's Temperance Union, the Shanghai Missionary Association, the Shanghai Christian Federation, the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association, the Christian Pui Society, the Ten-Man Corps for National Salvation through Christian Faith and Action in China, the American Church in Shanghai, Shanghai University, the Gospel Broadcasting Station, and the Chinese Women's Medical College, a total of twenty-one organizations, originally scheduled to hold a banquet at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA on the evening of the 16th of this month to bid farewell to Dr. Wang Rutang, who is going to the United States to take office. However, because Dr. Wang was on official business in Hangzhou and could not rush back, the public banquet was canceled and changed to a tea party at the YMCA on Yuanmingyuan Road at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. In addition to Mr. and Mrs. Wang, more than 50 representatives from various organizations were present. First, Chairman Dr. Chen Wenyuan gave a speech and presented Dr. Wang with a Bible and a hymn book on behalf of the organizations. Then, Ms. Sun Wang Guoxiu, the president of the YWCA, gave a farewell speech, stating that today's women's movement in China is making progress day by day. She hoped that Dr. Wang and his wife would be able to convey this to the American women's community and promote friendship between China and the United States. Next, Mr. Bao Yindeng, the representative of the National Christian Council, gave a farewell speech, saying that he and Wang had worked together at the National Association of YMCAs 26 years ago and admired his ability to handle affairs very much. Wang has also spared no effort in promoting international friendship and world peace and is a leader among Christians. Finally, the various organizations asked Wang to give some parting words for them to follow. Wang Rutang said that he was extremely grateful for everyone's sincerity and kindness, but due to time and his throat, he could not say much. He would just like to mention what he has felt in the past 30 years: ⑴ Most Chinese Christians now have a clearer understanding of their responsibility to the church. In the past, they relied solely on others, so those who believed in religion were called "eating the church." Now, they are willing to contribute their own money to run various charitable causes, such as hospitals, schools, and churches. The future is very promising. ⑵ Since most Christians know their own responsibility, it is hoped that all parties will cultivate them so that their ability can be improved and their responsibility can be increased. ⑶ Chinese and foreign Christians can cooperate and carry out various undertakings and promote them. This is not only related to the development of church undertakings but also has a great relationship with enhancing international friendship. Finally, he said that in addition to serving the country and promoting international friendship, he would also do his best for world peace. If there were any shortcomings, he hoped that everyone would give assistance and pray for him. The party broke up at 6:15 PM.

### Urgent Telegram from the Guizhou Branch of the China International Famine Relief Commission

Begging for Relief for Disaster Victims

Guizhou Province has been suffering from drought since last autumn, and the lack of rainfall has led to withered crops and panic among the people. People are fighting over fern roots and tree bark for food, and incidents of grain robbery are frequent. The Guizhou Branch of the China International Famine Relief Commission cannot bear to stand idly by and appeals to all parties for relief. It also telegraphed the General Commission at No. 505 Henan Road in this city, urging them to promote fundraising and provide assistance to save the disaster-stricken people. It is planned to submit the situation to the Executive Committee for discussion and decision-making, and then provide assistance and relief. The original telegram is transcribed below:

To the esteemed General Commission, Guizhou is an impoverished region where agricultural production is always difficult to sustain. In recent years, natural disasters and banditry have occurred one after another, severely damaging the vitality of society, leading to the decline of rural areas and a decrease in agricultural production. The future of the people's food supply is already causing panic. Furthermore, last year's severe drought affected more than 40 counties, with average harvests falling below 40%. Although the central government successively allocated more than 300,000 yuan in relief funds and the provincial government managed to raise tens of thousands of yuan to carry out county-level relief, it was like a drop in the bucket, unable to alleviate the massive disaster. There was hope for a good harvest this spring to regulate the people's food supply after April and before the autumn harvest. Therefore, from the government to the people, everyone advocated planting more buckwheat to prevent famine. Unexpectedly, the autumn drought was followed by a spring drought. For several months, there has been no heavy rain. Recently, the drought has become even more severe, with water sources drying up, fields cracking, crops withering, and food supplies becoming scarce. There is also concern about a shortage of drinking water. The previous hope for a spring harvest to barely sustain life has now become a pipe dream. Moreover, the food supply in the disaster area is almost entirely depleted. Even if heavy rain falls immediately, it will not affect the eastern planting, and the immediate food shortage is difficult to overcome. If rescue is not carried out quickly, the tragic scene of corpses strewn everywhere in 1925 will be repeated in the future. Recently, the scramble for fern roots and tree bark, and the trend of grain robbery, are just the beginning of the disaster. The current widespread phenomenon is that rice prices are soaring daily, making it difficult for even the wealthy to take care of themselves, let alone the poor. People with gaunt faces and tearful, hungry cries are almost everywhere. The government feels that providing relief is difficult, and the people are afraid of dying every day. We cannot bear to witness this suffering and are launching a fundraising campaign out of compassion for disaster relief. However, the disaster area is vast, making it difficult to provide universal relief. We believe that your commission is the savior of disaster victims in our country, admired both at home and abroad. The people of Guizhou in the past have especially felt your deep benevolence. In addition to appealing to the central government to quickly allocate funds for relief, we are sending this telegram to report the disaster situation, urging you to provide assistance and widely promote fundraising, so that the wailing and desperate people can have a better chance of survival. This urgent telegram conveys our utmost anticipation. Respectfully submitted by Lan Shiqian, Chairman of the Guizhou Branch, and all directors.

### Possession of an Unlicensed Handgun Results in a Fine of 300 Yuan

During the labor strike that occurred at the New Yu No. 2 Cotton Mill on Lubo Sheng Road last month, a foreman publicly intimidated workers with a handgun provided by the factory. As a result, the handgun was seized by the workers, and a shot was fired, fortunately without injuring anyone. Afterward, the handgun was handed over by the labor side to the Garrison Headquarters, which then transferred it to the Wutuo Road Police Station. It was discovered that this .32 caliber handgun, along with six bullets, had not been registered with the Bureau of Public Works. Therefore, in accordance with Article 186 of the Criminal Code, the First Special Court filed a public prosecution against Zeng Xiangxi, the manager of the New Yu No. 1 Cotton Mill, who was a native of Sichuan. He had been summoned once before, but the defendant did not appear, and the hearing was rescheduled. Details of this case have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the rescheduled hearing took place. The defendant, Zeng Xiangxi, appeared with his lawyer. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, presented the previous circumstances. According to the defendant's statement, No. 8 Lubo Sheng Road was originally the Puyi Cotton Mill. A month ago, it was taken over by the company and renamed the New Yu No. 2 Cotton Mill. There were originally two handguns, both of which had been registered and transferred to the factory. However, one of the handguns was damaged and could not be used. Therefore, this handgun was used as a replacement to be issued to the gate guards for defense purposes. Before the incident, an application had been submitted to the Bureau of Public Works to issue a license. On July 25th, a labor strike suddenly broke out in the factory, and the workers rushed into the office and destroyed equipment. The handgun was placed on the desk and was taken away by the workers. After hearing arguments from both sides, the presiding judge ruled that Zeng Xiangxi possessed military firearms and ammunition without permission and imposed a fine of 300 yuan. If he could not pay the fine, he would be sentenced to labor service, with three yuan equivalent to one day of labor. The handgun and six bullets were confiscated.

### Grain Merchants Telegraph Railway Department to Clear Congestion at Bengbu

Cargo transportation at Bengbu Station has been experiencing difficulties due to prolonged delays in the dispatch of vehicles, causing hardship for merchants. It is reported that the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain Trade Association telegraphed the Railway Department yesterday, urging them to find a way to clear the congestion. The original telegram reads: "To Minister Zhang of the Nanjing-Dong Railway Department: For more than a month, Bengbu has been experiencing a shortage of vehicles, and cargo is piling up like a mountain. The new grain and goods purchased and transported by our industry are experiencing sluggish sales and significant losses. Moreover, the wet season is approaching, and spoilage is a concern. We urgently telegraph your department to instruct the Jinpu Railway Administration to find a way to increase the number of vehicles and clear the accumulated cargo to facilitate transportation and alleviate the merchants' difficulties. This is extremely urgent." Respectfully, Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Trade Association.

### "Power Life" Drug Found to Contain No Aphrodisiac Ingredients

Police File Fraud Charges Separately

Yonghua Pharmacy, located at No. 512 Tianjin Road, previously published advertisements for a drug called "Power Life," claiming that the drug could treat nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation. In fact, it was said to contain aphrodisiac ingredients, which was discovered by the Zhabei Police Station. The sale of aphrodisiacs is strictly prohibited by law, so they went to confiscate a large quantity of "Power Life." After testing by the Public Health Department of the Bureau of Public Works, it was found that the drug did not contain any aphrodisiac ingredients. The police, believing that since the drug was not an aphrodisiac, the pharmacy was deceiving others, filed a public prosecution against Luo Huaji, the owner of the pharmacy, for fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Code. The case was heard yesterday morning by Judge Pan Zhenyang of the First Special Court in Criminal Division Two. The defendant, Luo Huaji, did not appear. After the lawyer Zhang Shizhu presented the case, he requested that the hearing be rescheduled. Judge Pan ordered the hearing to be rescheduled for one week.

### Murderer Chen Yousheng Sentenced to Fifteen Years in Prison

It is reported that the wet nurse has a lover named Zhang Guisheng, who is a tailor at No. 8 Heyu Lane, across from their house. He is also missing, which is highly suspicious of conspiracy. The reason for abducting the child is said to be that the child is about to be weaned, which Chen learned about. Chen also took away jewelry and other items. The investigation is currently underway.

### Postal Bureau Laborer Sues for 10,800 Yuan in Damages for Injured Foot

Xie Jinwen Files Private Prosecution; Foreign Director-General Zhapi Lin Named as Defendant

Xie Jinwen, a 31-year-old native of Anhui residing at No. 39 Shunyuwei, Yangshupu, used to work as a laborer at the Shanghai Postal Bureau. On November 3rd of last year, after getting off work at 6:00 PM, he and ten companions took Postal Bureau Truck No. 3 home. The truck was driven by driver Li Guifang. The truck stopped at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund. Eight people who were in the same truck with Xie got off first. Xie was the second to last to get off the truck. At that time, the truck had already started moving, causing Xie to lose his balance and fall, and his left foot was run over by the truck wheels. He was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment by the French Police and has not fully recovered after more than four months. He is currently receiving treatment at the Puai Hospital. Xie, due to the injury to his foot, is not only unable to recover in the short term but will also be disabled in the future and unable to make a living. Therefore, he hired attorney Wu Peng to file a private prosecution in the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court against truck driver Li Guifang and the foreign Director-General of the Postal Bureau, Zhapi Lin (transliteration), for negligent injury, requesting that they be prosecuted according to law and seeking damages of 10,800 yuan (calculated at one yuan per day for thirty years until the age of sixty). The court accepted the case and, yesterday morning, Judge Qiu Huanhu presided over the hearing in Criminal Division Two. The plaintiff was examined by the acting lawyer, who stated the plaintiff's intentions. Only the defendant, Li Guifang, appeared with his defense attorney. The small workers who were in the same truck at the time of the accident were also invited to the court to testify. After the court questioned both parties about the facts, it decided that the case still needed to be investigated and rescheduled the hearing.

### Fourteen Toyoda Mill Workers Sentenced to One Year and Two Months Each

Second Batch of Arrested Individuals Also Tried; Chen Zhixiang's Sentencing Set for the 24th

After the Toyoda Mill worker representative Sun Qiantai was stabbed, suspects were arrested, and the Caojiadu Sub-Bureau was requested to handle the case. The sub-bureau was destroyed, and the sub-bureau chief Tan Baoshou was injured. The Municipal Police Bureau Garrison Team arrested sixteen workers, including Jiang Asi, Zhou Lianchang, Yang Yuantian, Wu Jinsheng, Liu Chunqi, Yu Geda, Chen Chunsheng, Zhang Wenyuan, Zhang Asan, Wang Asan, Chen Chunguo, Hu Shouhou, Gan Songlin, Qin Qiaosheng, Qu Hongfa, and Yang Ar Er, and transferred them to the District Court. The prosecutor initially requested the release of the defendants at the request of the General Labor Union but subsequently filed a public prosecution. After three interrogations by the Criminal Division, Qu Hongfa and Yang Ar Er evaded and did not appear. At the final closing arguments, the judge ordered the fourteen defendants to pay a bail of 300 yuan each. At that time, due to insufficient bail, they were all detained. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Dong Ling opened the court and brought the fourteen detained defendants to the case, announcing the verdict. The defendants were sentenced to one year and two months in prison each for gathering a crowd to obstruct official duties, injure people, and damage property. All the defendants declared that they were dissatisfied and requested bail during the appeal period. The judge ruled that the previous bail bond had expired and that if they wanted bail, they had to pay a substantial bail and provide a business guarantor to the court for review to determine if they had the financial capacity to provide the guarantee before a decision could be made. They were ordered to be returned to custody. In addition, Xu Chengli, Zhou Tonghe, and the female workers Qu Guixiang and Zhou Ajin, who were recently arrested by the Public Security Bureau as part of the second batch of individuals who echoed and disturbed the peace, were also tried yesterday afternoon. The defendants all denied the charges. The court scheduled the verdict for the afternoon of the 24th. Xu and Zhou were ordered to find a suitable guarantor, and the female workers were returned to their original guarantors. Chen Zhixiang, the main offender in the stabbing of Sun Qiantai, was also tried yesterday afternoon. According to the prosecutor's argument, "Chen stabbed Sun out of resentment because he did not receive any monetary reward after initially helping Sun establish the union." The court also scheduled the verdict for the afternoon of the 24th and ordered Chen to be returned to custody.

### Sun Meitang Accused of Embezzlement, Court Does Not Accept the Case

Because the Plaintiff Has No Right to Sue Privately

Sun Meitang, the owner of the Meihuali Watch and Clock Shop on Nanjing Road, was recently sued in the First Special Court for embezzlement by Zhu Zhenkang and Wang Lingfu, who hired lawyers. The case concerns Sun Meitang, who is a managing director of the Ning Shao Shipping Company, allegedly embezzling 109,933.54 yuan and 45,462.37 yuan in the name of the Meihuali Head Office of the Yingxi Zhenda Silver Company in 1935. The First Special Court has already interrogated him once. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng continued the hearing in Criminal Division Eight. The defendant, Sun Meitang, appeared with his defense attorneys Liu Chunlu and Lu Jun. The plaintiffs, Zhu Zhenkang and Wang Lingfu, complained of the defendant's embezzlement, claiming that they were both shareholders of the Ning Shao Company, each holding 25 yuan in shares. The witness, Zhu Meiguang, testified that he was the general manager of the Ning Shao Shipping Company. The company's capital was 1.5 million yuan, and the chairman of the board was Yu Zuoting. The defendant was formerly the managing director of the company and the owner of the Meihuali Head Office, and there were dealings with the company. The defendant does owe the company more than 100,000 yuan, but according to the market price, interest is charged at 8.5% per month, and it has been approved by the company's shareholders' meeting. Judge Huang ruled that the Ning Shao Company is a limited liability company and has the status of a legal person. The plaintiffs have no right to file a private prosecution, so the case was not accepted.

Three Suicides, One Girl

Yesterday morning, the Procuratorate of the First Special District Court, after receiving reports from various police stations, requested the examination of four male and female bodies. At around 10:00 AM, Prosecutor Zhang Zongru, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerks, went to the Fielun Road Morgue to examine the bodies one by one, instructing the families to sign separate agreements to claim the bodies. The causes of death are listed below:

Yao Shenghai, 22 years old, from Zhenjiang, worked as a laborer at the Huafeng Craft Shop at No. 16 Yuezhou Lane, Yuezhou Road. Recently, due to financial difficulties, he secretly took a machine head from the shop and pawned it for money. Unable to redeem it, he went to Room 51 of the Anle Hotel at No. 321 North Zhejiang Road at around 9:00 PM on the 19th of this month and, overcome by despair, ingested opium and committed suicide. At around 3:00 AM the day before yesterday, a tea boy at the hotel discovered him and reported it to the Huisi Police Station, which dispatched Chinese detective Shen Dehui to investigate. Yao was rushed to Tongren Hospital, but attempts to save him failed, and he died.

Wu Baogen, 48 years old, from Chongming, lived at No. 9, Lane 488, Air Keen Road. He worked as a tea servant for the Dade Gongwan at Tian Tong Road. Recently, due to financial difficulties and unable to obtain loans, he ingested opium at home on the 19th of this month, overcome by despair, and committed suicide. His cousin Wu Genfu discovered him and reported it to the Huisi Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. He was rushed to Renji Hospital, but treatment was ineffective, and he died at 9:25 AM the day before yesterday.

Xing Tang, a woman from Tongzhou, 19 years old, lived at No. 42, Lane 1069, Broadway Road. Her husband, Xing Hongchun, was a foreman on the wharf. Recently, she suffered from an illness that caused extreme pain. Although she sought medical treatment, it was ineffective, causing her extreme frustration. The day before yesterday, overcome by despair, she went to the bedroom and hanged herself. Her husband and others discovered her and reported it to the Huishan Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. She was sent to the Shengxin Hospital, but treatment was ineffective, and she died shortly after.

Zhu Rongqing, from Ningbo, had a daughter named Jinmei, who was seven years old. At 2:30 PM on the 19th of this month, while the girl was playing on the drying platform at her grandmother's house at No. 3, Lane 147, Air Coke Road, with her neighbor Zhang Yuhua (also seven years old), she accidentally fell.

### Eleven Male and Female Robbers Involved in Three Cases

Defendants Confess to Robberies; Insufficient Food and Air

On the morning of the 16th of last month, Zhou Rongting's house, located at No. 3 Liuxian Village, Mintini Yin Road, French Concession, was robbed of jewelry, gold ornaments, clothing, and cash worth 2,660 yuan. The French Police have now solved the case and arrested eight members of the gang, including Gu Shihua, Li Wancai, Cai Xu, Gu Li, Wang Yonggao, Ding Zhang, Song Hongfa, and Wang Yongsen, all from Jiangbei. They were handed over to the Special Second Court for interrogation and detention. Three others, Wang Daoyuan, Chen Ganquan, and Feng Ar Rong, were brought from the First Special District Court.

Some of the stolen goods were recovered. Yesterday, Liao Jun, the Criminal Division Chief of the Special Second Court, continued the trial in Criminal Division One. The Police Department lawyer stated that the investigation was not complete and requested a seven-day extension for prosecution. Wang Daoyuan confessed that Cai Xu (aka Aying) acted as a lookout, while Zhang Xiaokui and Zhang Yongxiang (both at large) initiated the plan, colluding with Li Dacheng (at large), Wang Da (at large), and the defendants and Li Wancai and Chen Ganquan to commit the robbery. Cai Xu also went to the Zhang's house when they robbed Zhang's family. Gu Shihua exchanged the stolen goods from Zhou's house for money, which was divided into sixteen shares, each receiving 34 yuan. The court questioned each defendant once. It was decided to reschedule the hearing to 2:00 PM on May 5th. The defendants were returned to custody.

### Conflicting Testimonies in Du Wu's Wife-Killing Case

Wife Says Husband Consorted with Bad People; Husband Says Wife Committed Adultery and Hid a Knife

Du Wenkui from Huaian, Jiangbei (also known as Du Wu, currently 38 years old), and his legal wife, Ms. Li (currently 35 years old), due to her licentious nature, according to Du, had an affair with Zhou Guangfa, a man from Shandong, in Nanjing last winter. Du caught them in the act and decided to

Move to a Better Place. The family moved to a thatched hut on Jinling Road, Zhabei, in this city. However, Zhou also came to Shanghai to continue the affair and engaged in behavior detrimental to the husband. Du claims to have found a small knife by his pillow. Therefore, Du, along with his older brother Du Wenli (also known as Du Si), his younger brother Du Wenhua (also known as Du Liu), and Xu Qingsi, Wenhua's brother-in-law, used sharp knives at Moling Lane, Jinling Road, to stab Ms. Li's head, arms, and other areas over a dozen times.

Ms. Li cried out for help. Fearing arrest, Du and the others fled in a panic. Neighbors rushed Ms. Li to Renji Hospital for treatment. After forty-one days, her life was saved, but she was blinded in one eye. Du Si and Du Liu were arrested by the police and taken to the local court. After investigation, the court found that Du Wu had fled to Xiaguan in Nanjing. The chief prosecutor of the court sent a confidential letter to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, ordering the detective team to rush to Xiaguan and arrest Du Wu, who was then transferred to the local court. Du claimed

He had no intention of fleeing out of fear of punishment. He said that after his brothers were arrested, he wrote to his father-in-law, asking him to hire a lawyer, which is why he was arrested in Nanjing. The prosecutor was clear that the Du brothers had committed murder and jointly filed charges against them, including the fugitive Xu Qingsi. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zongxing opened the court for trial. Ms. Li Du testified that she was 35 years old, from Huaian, living in a thatched hut on Jinling Road, Zhabei. She had been married to her husband, Du Wenkui, for twelve years and had no children. They married in 1925. In 1927, they went to Nanjing, and in 1928, Du took a concubine, Ms. Chen, in their hometown. Subsequently, Du and Chen engaged in

A lawsuit for assault. From then on, her husband abandoned her. She had no choice but to make a living by peddling with her father. Du now has a woman on Maigen Road, but she has not seen her. Last year, he was arrested by the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters for theft. She received a letter telling her so. She asked her father to visit him in Nanjing, and he was released. Ten days later, a friend from Shanghai, Xu Jingeng, also known as Xiao Yangzhou, wrote to her, asking her husband to go to Shanghai. She also came to Shanghai. On January 12th, she saw that her husband was not working all day and was associating with bad people, so she advised him to return to the right path and cursed his bad friend Xu Jingeng. On January 19th, he was so ashamed that he falsely invited her to drink alcohol in order to carry out his plan. Halfway there, Xu grabbed her, and her husband

Stabbed me with a knife. Her uncle and younger siblings had been lying in wait and guarding the area. Ms. Li's father, Du Shan, testified that he was 72 years old and lived at 841 Daqing Lane, Roberts Road. Ms. Li Du was his daughter. His son-in-law was arrested last year for theft, and his daughter scolded him every day, leading to enmity. Du Wenkui testified that he was 38 years old and worked as a dockworker. Because his wife wanted to conspire with her lover to harm him, he stole her

Lover's knife to deal with her. He said he acted on Xinmin Road. The first time he discovered her adultery was in Nanjing. To save face, he moved to Shanghai, but she followed him. He was always on the lookout and felt a small knife on the pillow by the bed, so he was angry and wanted to kill her. He asked for leniency. When Du Wenli and Du Wenhua were questioned, they flatly denied any involvement, saying that Ms. Li was plotting to implicate the entire Du family and wept, pleading for investigation. The court adjourned for further investigation, and the defendants were remanded in custody.

### Wu Wenjuan Sues for Divorce Due to Husband's Prior Adultery

Gu Wenbao's Fall: Awaiting File and Public Notice

Wu Wenjuan, a young woman from Beiping, is currently 32 years old. Although past her youthful years, she is still stunningly beautiful. At the age of seventeen, she was married to Gu Wenbao, a merchant from the same area, by her parents. At the beginning of their marriage, their relationship was excellent. A year later, they had a son named Baobao, who is now twelve years old. Later, Gu became addicted to pleasure and immersed himself in brothels, working as a scribe at night, lacking energy, and also falling into the habit of opium, losing his job and staying idle. The family finances declined, and they could not afford to live. Therefore, Wu Wenjuan was introduced by her uncle to the Huacheng Tobacco Company as an employee, earning more than twenty yuan a month to support the family and pay for her child's tuition. Gu, on the other hand, stayed at home, leading a boring life. This lasted for about seven years. In 1933, Wu Wenjuan was unfortunately dismissed by the factory, and the couple were both unemployed. They lived in fear and pawned their belongings to make a living. Eventually, they ran out of things to pawn and were reduced to poverty. They discussed that rather than starve to death, they should take a risky and shameful path. Wenjuan was still in her prime and beautiful, so they decided that she would sell herself. Wu Wenjuan became a "waiter" at the Fuxiangli brothel, serving wine when the lights came on. She met a sympathetic customer. The small house was rented. Gu Wenbao, fearing that it would be taken away by others, in desperation, went to the police station to accuse her of adultery. The illicit lovers were taken to court, where the First Special Court ruled that because Gu Wenbao had been an adulterer before, Wu Wenjuan and her lover were acquitted according to law. Therefore, Wu Wenjuan filed a petition with the Nanshi Local Court, requesting a divorce from her husband so she could be free. She also stated that she did not know where her husband was. Yesterday, Judge Yu interrogated her to find out whether Gu Wenbao had indeed done as described above and what the court's criminal verdict was. The file and public notice to the defendant are awaited so an investigation and decision can be made. The case has been adjourned for another hearing.

### Detective's Use of Torture to Obtain Confession for Assault and Other Crimes

He Wenjin and Others Indicted; Civil Suit Filed for Compensation

On February 9th of this year, over fifty bags of wheat were stolen from the Shen Da Flour Mill. The guard, Lu Tianfa, suspected Wan Ruxi and Wan Xiaochengzi of the theft and reported it to the Municipal Police Bureau, which sent detectives He Wenjin and Gu Junqing from the Ximen Branch to bring Wan and the others to the station. He Wenjin and Gu Junqing, because they refused to confess, tied Wan Ruxi's hands and tortured him, causing injuries. Lawyer Xue Lisheng filed a lawsuit with the local court, requesting justice and upholding human rights. Prosecutor Yang Ruxiu investigated the case and found that Wan and the others were not only innocent but also wrongfully imprisoned and immediately released them. A forensic doctor was also ordered to examine Wan and confirmed that he was indeed injured. The prosecutor summoned detectives He Wenjin and Gu Junqing to court for investigation. They both denied the facts, saying that Wan and the others had fabricated the injuries and falsely accused them. Lawyer Xue continued to submit evidence, stating that Wan and the others were in custody and had been escorted to the court. A court inspection was immediately conducted and if the injuries were fake, the police guards must have helped to inflict them. Therefore, their claim was a complete cover-up. The prosecutor indicted detectives He Wenjin and Gu Junqing for violating Article 302, Paragraph 1, and Article 277, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law, for obstructing freedom and assault, and requested the criminal court to impose a severe sentence for the most serious crime. The trial is scheduled to be held publicly by the criminal court today. Lawyer Xue will appear in court on behalf of the victim to pursue the case and file a civil suit for compensation for wrongful imprisonment and medical expenses.

### Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank Annual Report for the 25th Year (Continued)

II. Stability of the Currency System: Apart from the rise in commodity prices, the most important economic events of the year were the stability of the currency system and the bumper harvest, which were also the main factors contributing to the rise in commodity prices. Since the currency system reform in early October of the 24th year of the Republic of China, the exchange rate has remained stable at around the average rate of the past five years. Although it has been repeatedly attacked by speculators during times of tense Sino-Japanese relations, it has not been significantly affected. Only when the value of the French franc was extremely unstable in the autumn was the range of changes in China's foreign exchange rate slightly expanded to cope with the drastic changes in British and American exchange rates. Since France officially abandoned the gold standard, it has returned to stability. This kind of stable achievement was unexpected by most people and is sufficient to prove that the stable exchange rate at that time could indeed conform to the national conditions. Since the currency system reform, foreign trade has obviously improved. This year's import trade was over 94.41 million yuan, an increase of over 22.2 million yuan compared with the 24th year; export trade was over 70.5 million yuan, an increase of over 13 million yuan compared with the 24th year. The trade deficit was over 23.5 million yuan, a decrease of over 10.7 million yuan compared with the 24th year. This is because the exchange rate was lowered and remained stable, so the increase in export trade was far greater than that of import trade. This trade deficit figure cannot be taken as reliable history due to the rampant smuggling in North China. However, if the currency system were not reformed, the trade deficit would undoubtedly be even greater than this number. Moreover, since the exchange rate stabilized, remittances from overseas Chinese have also been more abundant than in previous years, which may be enough to offset the expenditure of smuggling and have a surplus. Therefore, it is very possible that this year's international balance of payments will turn into a surplus, which will be of great help to the stability of the currency system. Since the foreign exchange rate has been reduced by 20% at the time of the currency system reform, domestic commodity prices have also risen successively during this year, which also has a causal relationship.

III. Bumper Harvest: However, the appropriate foreign exchange rate is a major reason for the improvement of the international balance of payments, and another major reason is the bumper harvest this year. Even the rise in prices is closely related to the harvest. In the past, China imported a large amount of rice, grain, and cotton. This year, due to the bumper harvest, the import of commodities such as rice and cotton has been greatly reduced. The import of rice and grain this year was about 27 million yuan, while the import in the 24th year reached more than 89.5 million yuan, a decrease of about 63 million yuan. The import of wheat this year was over 11.8 million yuan, while the import in the 24th year reached over 34.8 million yuan, a decrease of about 23 million yuan. The import of cotton this year was over 36 million yuan, while in the 24th year it was over 41 million yuan, a decrease of about 9 million yuan. The total reduction in imports for the three items reached 90 million yuan. On the other hand, the important commodities whose exports increased due to the domestic bumper harvest included cotton, which was over 21.1 million yuan in the 24th year and over 28.8 million yuan this year, an increase of over 6.4 million yuan. Rice and wheat were about 1 million yuan in the 24th year and increased to about 5 million yuan this year, an increase of 4 million yuan. In terms of these three items alone, the increase in exports reached over 10 million yuan. If we add up the decrease in imports and the increase in exports, we get over 100 million yuan, which is consistent with the decrease in the trade deficit. Therefore, it is almost impossible to deny that the decrease in the trade deficit is due to the bumper harvest of China's main agricultural products. Moreover, when the agricultural products were abundant, it happened that overseas grain prices rose, and the exchange rate also fell. The coffers were full, so the prices were able to maintain a considerable level, and the story of "cheap grain hurting farmers" did not occur. Therefore, the purchasing power of rural areas has increased significantly. The sales and prices of daily necessities such as cotton yarn and cotton cloth have increased, and the price index has begun to rise significantly since the second half of this year. If it were not for the bumper harvest, how could this be achieved? From this, it can be seen that although the improvement of China's economic situation this year is due to the stability of the currency system, the unification of the political situation, and the rebound of commodity prices, the importance of the bumper harvest is actually higher than any other factor.

According to estimates from various sources, the degree of this year's bumper harvest is the highest for cotton. The lowest estimate of this year's output is about 14 million dan, an increase of more than 70% compared to last year, which is an unprecedented record. The second is soybeans, with 126 million city dan, and peanuts with 55 million city dan, both of which increased by more than 30% compared with the 24th year. The third is sesame, with over 17 million city dan, and sorghum with over 150 million city dan, both of which increased by 10% to 15% compared with the 24th year. The estimated harvest of rice is 1 billion city dan, an increase of about 4% compared with the 24th year. The estimated harvest of wheat is 46 million city dan, an increase of 8% compared with the 24th year. In addition, the output of minor crops such as barley, corn, and tobacco has also increased. In terms of various provinces, Shandong, Anhui, Hubei, and Hunan have benefited the most. Shandong cotton and peanuts, Anhui rice, wheat, soybeans, and cotton, Hubei cotton, wheat, and soybeans, and Hunan rice and cotton have all had particularly abundant harvests. Therefore, the increase in the purchasing power of the people in these provinces is significant. The second is Hebei, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Henan, and Shanxi provinces. As for Shaanxi, except for the bumper harvest of cotton, the food crops were mostly poor, and the local food supply became a problem, resulting in a large number of flour being transported to the province in the latter half of this year. In Zhejiang, minor crops such as soybeans, rapeseed, and broad beans have also had good harvests, which can be said to be an exception to the abundant year.

IV. Financial Stability: Due to the bumper harvest and the stability of the currency system, the financial situation is much more stable than in the past. The issuance of legal tender has increased rapidly due to the gradual withdrawal of the use of cash. The total amount at the end of the year was 110 million yuan, with sufficient reserves and increasing credit. The number of bank and money shop closures has decreased significantly, and the difficulties in operation are much less than in the past. However, most bankers have felt the impact of the financial panic and have had to rectify their past shortcomings, and they have not been able to rapidly develop their financial affairs. Not many new banks and money shops have been opened. As industry and commerce have gradually recovered, bank and money shop deposits have increased significantly, and the capital market has tended to be loose. In terms of Shanghai interbank interest rates, they are usually around 8%, with very few special changes. Looking at the future, there is a tendency towards a low interest rate pattern. At the same time, the capital turnover rate is also faster than in the past. This year's Shanghai clearing volume, calculated for both banks and money shops, has increased by about one-half compared with previous years. (To be continued)

### Overview of the Physics Department Exhibition

Our department was founded in the 2nd year of the Republic of China and has reached its 24th year. Those in charge were Dr. Xiong Xuanxue, Professors Zhu and Zhang. Recently, Professor Xu Jinghan and Dr. Li Qingxian have succeeded each other and actively planned, and the department's affairs are thriving. The exhibition program for this year is as follows:

(I) Radio Engineering Group: Radio is an emerging science, and its application is vast and its progress is rapid, which cannot be compared with any other science. Even the radios sold on the market are changing with each passing day, making people dizzy. But in fact, they cannot escape a few basic principles and circuits. This group displays various basic structures, including transceivers, transmitters, long waves, and ultra-short waves.

(II) Mathematics Group: Mathematics is the backbone of all sciences and occupies a leading position. Often there are mysterious formulas that people know but cannot apply. After hundreds of years, they find that they can match a certain science, and thereby open up a new path. So mathematics can also be said to be the source of science, and we naturally have something to exhibit. However, what can mathematics display? Formulas and theories are all in the minds of mathematicians, and it is impossible to peek into their mysteries for a while. We can only display the tools used in mathematics, such as models of solids and curved surfaces, and various wonderful diagrams for people to appreciate.

(III) General Physics Group: This group displays various simple and important teaching experiments in general physics to make beginners more thorough in learning theory and to arouse the interest of those who have not learned.

(IV) Mechanics Group: Physics takes mechanics as its starting point, and its principles are the most basic. We have specially displayed various instruments for measuring weights and measures, instruments for measuring physical properties, and experiments on statics and dynamics in turn.

(V) Workshop: Because physical instruments have precise structures and are of great value, and they are all foreign goods, they are often damaged. In order to be self-sufficient, we have set up a small workshop. Although this workshop has only a short history, it is already well-equipped, and there are several products. Please visit our tools and our self-made products.

(VI) Optics Group: This group puts optical instruments, such as microscopes and cameras, etc., and various phenomena of light, such as reflection, refraction, and interference, etc. All those that can be displayed in sunlight are arranged separately.

(VII) Thermodynamics Group: This group has a lot of various instruments and experiments on thermodynamics. Even in the item of thermometers alone, there are more than a dozen kinds. There are also many newly improved instruments.

(VIII) Electrical Engineering Group: Everyone knows the greatness of the application of electricity. All daily life, transportation, national defense, and light and heavy industry cannot do without electricity. Therefore, the Electrical Engineering Group is indeed worth visiting. Here are sophisticated measuring instruments, daily necessities, and motors, etc.

(IX) Modern Physics and Optics Group: Physics in the 20th century has entered the stage of studying the interior of matter. The interior of matter cannot be seen with the eyes or touched with the hands. How can it be measured? But physicists have experimental methods to prove it. This group has spectrometers, radioactive pottery, Anke ltJ light, and sou quan jin dao. After you visit, you can probably know what is inside matter? Because this exhibition room is a dark room, there are also wonderful optical phenomena that can only be seen in the dark, which are also displayed here.

### Soochow University Physics Department Radio Experiment Room

### Overview of the Chemistry Department Exhibition

The Chemistry Department of Soochow University has a history of more than 20 years. It was initially founded by Dr. Gong from the United States. After the 13th year of the Republic of China, it was successively presided over by Mr. Shen Huiyuan, Mr. Pan Zhenming, and Dr. Gu Yidong. This exhibition is divided into nine rooms, which are briefly described as follows:

First Physical Chemistry Exhibition Room: Physical chemistry is the theoretical basis of all chemistry. What is displayed in this Ning place can be divided into photochemistry, thermochemistry, electrochemistry, colloid chemistry, and solution properties. Various instruments are very sophisticated, such as glass electrodes and bomb calorimeters.

Second Microanalysis Chemistry Exhibition Room: Microanalysis is an analytical method that has developed rapidly in recent years and is a major advancement in recent chemistry. Our school has specially set up this subject, which is rare among universities in China. The balances and instruments used are mostly newly purchased and are very accurate.

Third Biochemistry Exhibition Room: Biochemistry is based on the study of the nutritional value of various foods; so we use models to tell everyone. Other displays include the importance of seaweed, the method of judging the quality of milk, and fat extraction devices.

Fourth and Fifth Industrial Chemistry Exhibition Rooms: Industrial chemistry is practical chemistry. It is also a part of chemistry that has the most direct relationship with people's lives. We are also most interested in this subject. In order to make the public understand the situation of various industries, we display the production procedures and products one by one, such as paint making, leather making, paper making, etc., which are all important industries. There are also various unit machines, such as grinders, vacuum distillation machines, emulsifiers, high-pressure heaters, and clarifying separators, etc., to show their use in the manufacturing process.

Sixth National Defense Chemistry and Inorganic Chemistry Exhibition Room: National defense chemistry is knowledge that every citizen should always know. This room displays the preparation methods of various poisonous gases, as well as defense methods, the manufacturing and structure of gas masks. There are also the manufacture and release of various colored signal flares. The fuel problem is also an important national defense matter. Therefore, some of our students are studying the gas phase cracking method of extracting gasoline from vegetable oil. It is also displayed here. Inorganic chemistry is the basis of chemistry. What we display includes various methods for determining molecular weight, various demonstration devices, as well as Hawkins' three-dimensional periodic table and other various periodic tables, and the actual objects are displayed in them. There are also the characteristics of various inorganic compounds, etc.

Among them is the work recently entrusted by the Wu County Government to our county to conduct chemical testing on behalf of the county in order to determine the water source for the establishment of a city-wide water supply.

Eighth Analytical Chemistry Exhibition Room: The composition of each substance can only be determined by analytical chemistry. In this room, there are special analysis methods, semi-micro analysis, ordinary qualitative and quantitative analysis, such as opium analysis methods, and new auxiliary coin analysis, as well as various special instruments used for analysis, such as colorimeters, turbidity meters, and oxidation prevention devices, etc. Some of them are specially designed and custom-made by our department. Each student in our school who studies analytical chemistry has one.

Ninth Organic Chemistry Exhibition Room: There are more than 200,000 kinds of organic compounds in the world, which shows the importance of organic chemistry. What we display includes various extraction devices, various filtration methods, various distillation devices, the quantitative determination method of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in organic matter, the fuel problem, and the preparation procedures of various organic matter, etc.

### History and Exhibition Overview of the Biology Department

Our department has a history of more than 20 years. It is the earliest university in the country to establish a biology department. It was initially founded by Dr. Qi Tianxi. Later, Mr. Hu Jingfu, Mr. Dai Su, and Mr. Zhang He successively presided over it. The management was difficult. Various facilities have gradually become perfect. Animal and plant specimens, various charts, and slides of embryology, animal and plant histology, entomology, plant morphology, parasitology, and mycology are even more beautiful. In the past year, with the promotion and assistance of the Ministry of Education, there has been more progress. Graduation theses have always focused on the exploration of domestic and local organisms. Therefore, there is more research on the animals and plants of Jiangsu Province.

Our school is located in the three Wu areas. The products are abundant and the collection is excellent. In view of the fact that the experimental materials of various academic institutions and schools are all transported from overseas, the leakage is very large. There is a plan to establish a biological materials office. With the assistance of the Rockefeller Foundation and the Science Society, it can be realized. It has been established for more than a year. It can be used by various places in the country. The publication of "Two-Month Magazine" has made more contributions to the biological community. Based on the experience gained over the years, this office has made many developments in technology. Such as animal anatomy and colored injection of blood vessels and other technologies are even more difficult. European and American countries and all provinces in the country have authorized the products of this office, and have won good reputation. We are still continuing to work hard to live up to the expectations of all parties.

The Biology Exhibition of this year is a collaboration between the professors and students of the department to promote science and promote national construction. The exhibits are divided into fourteen sections. (1) Genetics and Eugenics. Examples of species exhibiting the laws of heredity such as fruit flies, corn, ladybugs, guinea pigs, etc., and human personality, constitution, characteristics, etc., are demonstrated. (2) Invertebrate Zoology. In addition to specimens, many live animals are added. (3) Comparative Anatomy of Vertebrates. There are dissections of human bodies and higher animals. (4) Animal Histology. There are slides with magnified depictions, and real objects of organ structures, etc. (5) Parasitology. In addition to displaying the necessary items for academics, more attention is paid to common sense. (6) Entomology. There are various live animals and representative specimens of classifications. Special explanations are given for harmful and beneficial insects. (7) Herpetology. There are no less than 30 or 40 kinds of salamanders, shellfish, toads, lizards, snakes, turtles, etc. Most of those produced locally are collected. Specimens of those not produced locally are also set up. In terms of practical use, there are displays and rearing methods of American giant frogs. (8) Embryology. There are developmental procedures for various mammalian embryos, and embryo specimens such as fish and frogs. (9) Plant Morphology. There are various algae, moss ferns, cryptogams, phanerogams, and other plants. (10) Plant Taxonomy. More attention is paid to local plants. All those that are wild or artificially cultivated and are related to taxonomy are displayed. (11) Plant Physiology. There are examples of plant absorption, photochemical action, and environmental relationships. (12) Mycology. There are antibiotic tests, bacterial cultures, disinfection methods, etc. (13) Economic Botany. There are various kinds of wood and their manufactured goods such as fruits, grains, paints, medicines, etc. (14) Animal and Plant Experimental Materials and Slide Making Methods. Displays of taxidermy skeletons, transparent specimens, water travel boxes, and various slide making and staining techniques.

Last autumn, my colleagues and I realized that scholars in this country have only fragmented research on freshwater organisms, especially on the value of sanitation and economy, and there is also a lack of concrete and systematic research. Therefore, there is a plan to establish a freshwater biology research institute. Liu Chengzhao was appointed to preside over it. Wu Zhong is known as the country of Ze. There are lakes and marshes everywhere. There are very rich freshwater organisms. Setting up a research institute will provide many materials and will surely have great results. Now, during the exhibition, the establishment ceremony will be held. Most of the items displayed this time are live animals. All aquatic plants, plankton, fish, shrimp, shellfish, aquatic insects, and other lower animals are brought together. In addition, there are more than 40 kinds of fishing net models and various fishing methods. However, at the beginning of the opening, we still hope that domestic scholars and people from all walks of life will not hesitate to give advice. Our school will do our best to work in academics, economics, sanitation, and statistics. So as not to betray the good intentions of the elegant.

### Inaugural Address

— Ding Xuyan

We must acknowledge that the revival of Germany, the success of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, and Italy's victory over Abyssinia are all the result of their emphasis on science and diligent research. They are the result of their people having a considerable degree, understanding, and faith in science. China, as one of the ancient civilized nations, is not inferior to European and American countries in philosophy, literature, and art, and even surpasses them in some areas. However, it is undeniable that China's science is still immature and backward. Therefore, saving the nation through science and the movement for scientific advancement are extremely urgent needs today.

However, in recent years, exhibitions of various kinds have sprung up everywhere in China. Art exhibitions, literature exhibitions, calligraphy and painting exhibitions have emerged like a rising tide, each showing its unique strengths. Only scientific exhibitions are rarely seen. It is true that scientific exhibitions are extremely difficult to organize due to factors such as materials, personnel, funding, time, and location. But can we be afraid of difficulties and seek only ease and comfort? Can we not use our spare time and the facilities of the science departments in our schools to engage in small-scale—beneficial and inexpensive—scientific advancement movements?

If a scientific exhibition in China were to be organized by a national university in Sichuan, it could have a large-scale presentation and cause a sensation, attracting the attention or praise of the people. Now, a private school—Soochow University—is attempting this. It feels a lack of resources in terms of materials. It can only move forward towards the future of science with a "once every three years" effort, based on the spirit of "hard work, relentless effort, and quick action." We dare not harbor any extravagant hopes. However, in my opinion, the significance of this Soochow Science Exhibition is roughly as follows:

First, it can expand the scientific knowledge of young people. In recent years, the government's educational policy has emphasized practical sciences. Young students cannot help but take the path of science. They have a strong desire for knowledge, but their knowledge usually comes from textbooks. In a science exhibition, there are various instruments, specimens, medicines, models, machines, charts, reference documents, and so on, which can allow them to gain intuitive concepts from physical objects. This can arouse their interest in research and make their wisdom more deeply impressed and particularly applicable.

Second, it can make science a public study: China has abundant resources, but how to utilize these resources, how to use precise scientific methods, and how to conduct practical research on the issues that need to be resolved, scientific colleagues can cooperate and work together. For example, multiple people can study a particular problem from multiple perspectives at the same time. The contributions may be different, but the effect will be more complete. If universities and academic institutions across the country could regularly organize scientific exhibitions, everyone could learn from each other. Wouldn't that be great? Moreover, public research is also an attitude that scientists should maintain.

Third, it can popularize and simplify science: The general public often has doubts or even contempt for the effectiveness of science. Some consider it a "trivial skill" that is of no benefit to the nation, while others consider it too theoretical and not practical for everyday use. If these misconceptions are not corrected effectively and subtly, it will be a major obstacle to the progress of science. If scientific exhibitions can be held from time to time throughout the country, not only will the above-mentioned misconceptions be swept away, but the public will also be somewhat baptized by science. Only then can the movement for scientific advancement in China be considered a success.

Fourth, it can make everyone realize that scientific research is not as easy or as difficult as generally imagined. People often either do not trust scientists very much or are too demanding of them. For example, if they ask a question and cannot get an answer immediately because it involves too much, they always feel dissatisfied. This is because they see science as too easy and too simple. Conversely, some people think that pseudoscience is more difficult than anything else and simply ignore it. However, although problems may be complex, careful study will ultimately reveal the underlying principles. Science exhibitions provide clear and accurate observations of a speck of dust, a drop of blood, an atom, or an electron, and offer simple and thorough explanations, so that everyone can believe that to solve many scientific problems, one must use instruments and medicines for experiments, refer to literature, and be prepared to sacrifice considerable energy and time. Otherwise, there is no hope. However, these experiments, references, and sacrifices are of considerable value. As long as one is willing to experiment, refer, and sacrifice, there will be corresponding results. Therefore, one of the meanings of a science exhibition is to gain public sympathy and understanding for the painstaking efforts of scientists, so that they will not say that science is as easy as turning one's hand or as difficult as climbing to the sky.

Soochow University is holding a scientific exhibition to promote science, awaken the public, and encourage public research. This exhibition has been held several times in the past. However, this year, the only Freshwater Biological Research Institute in China was officially established at our school. At the same time, the school's new gymnasium and new women's dormitory were also completed. This is a rare opportunity that yields multiple benefits. However, regarding the preparation and arrangement of this exhibition, there are still many imperfections. We hope that enthusiastic colleagues and people from all walks of life will be extra forgiving and further guide us. April 20, 1937, at the College of Science, Soochow University

### Children's Health Competition

— Meng Ruo

Recently, people in our country have gradually become aware of the importance of children's health. For example, the organization of children's health competitions by various institutions is one example. Recently, this competition will be held again in our city. The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Health Education Society is scheduled to hold a children's health competition on the 25th of this month. All public and private kindergartens and primary schools in the city are encouraged by their principals to actively participate, bringing students and their families. In addition, the Shanghai Children's Welfare Clinic, established by the Chinese Children's Welfare Association in Zhabei, is also scheduled to hold a large-scale children's health competition for three days starting on the 24th of next month. Five hundred participants will be divided into three groups: infants, toddlers, and young children.

The purpose of holding children's health competitions is to guide children's hygiene and promote children's health. The intention can be said to be extremely good. Because children are the future strength of the nation, the strength or weakness of children's bodies is related to the prosperity or decline of the nation, which is very important. Therefore, all countries attach great importance to children's health issues. Governments and various health education organizations are working hard on children's health. Our country's awareness of children's health has only emerged in recent years. However, thanks to the efforts of people in society, although the results are not very good, they have had quite an impact. Holding children's health competitions many times can awaken the attention of parents in general families. However, to protect children's health, it is not enough to just hold competitions. After the competition, once we understand the health status of children, we should find ways to improve children's physical fitness and make them strong. Otherwise, holding the competition is just a lively event, and it does not bring much benefit to children.

Looking at the general situation, the health of children in our country is obviously very deficient. Because children in ordinary families lack education due to environment and various other reasons, there are few children with strong physiques and many with weak physiques. Let us take the children in schools as an example. According to a previous test of tuberculosis bacteria in primary school students in our city, the results of the test of 2,916 people in five schools showed that 2,137 people had been infected, 739 people had not been infected, and the reaction of 40 people was unknown. From this statistic, it can be seen that the number of people with tuberculosis bacteria is as high as 70%, which is a considerable number. Also, not long ago, a report was published in the education column of this newspaper. A physical examination of primary school students in this city showed that among 9,000 students examined, 8,000 had shortcomings, accounting for 90% of the total number. This number is even more alarming. The unhealthy bodies of children in our country can be seen from this.

Therefore, we believe that it is important to care about children's health and hold competitions, but it is even more important to find remedies after the competition. For example, the health status of primary school students in this city is extremely worrying and must be remedied. This point should be emphasized by the health education authorities. Recently, Japan has paid close attention to national health. The health facility expenses for students proposed by the Ministry of Education have been passed by the parliament and will use 150,000 yuan to conduct a nationwide youth physical examination over a period of five years to investigate whether young people across the country have any diseases and their activity capacity, and to study concrete ways to improve national health. If our country can follow this approach, it will definitely be of considerable help to the physical fitness of the people.

### A Trip in Spring

— Ping Zi

Squeezed inside a heavy truck, and the road is so uneven, I really feel a lot of distress.

"When will we get through this bumpy road?"—I asked myself this, but I didn't know. Maybe it's like the road of life, you can stop at any time, but it won't stop in this very short time, because what my eyes see is still an endless plain.

The weather is also getting hot. It's said to be spring, but it also makes people impatient. The yellow soil rolled up by the wheels rushed up from behind like smoke. I coughed because I didn't have time to cover my mouth and nose with a handkerchief. On each face moistened by sweat, the color of the soil was attached, either thick or light. I laughed when I saw other people's faces, and my own face was also ridiculous. At this moment, we arrived at the place we wanted to go.

It was a famous scenic spot famous for plum blossoms. By the time we went, all the plum blossoms had fallen to the ground.

"Ah, too late!"—Sighs rose in everyone's heart like smoke, but this may not be entirely true. Some people were not lost in the petals abandoned on the ground, as if some kind of melancholy was heavily pressing on their hearts. It seems that they grew up in the city and are disturbed by human affairs every day, and they live happily and contentedly. When they arrive at this rustic place, they feel that everything is fresh, and they also think they should be a little refined, so they are as sentimental as talented scholars and beautiful women.

But I am relaxed, just like a person from outside the world, watching the clear water flowing down from the top of the small mountain: Someone is putting a small boat folded out of paper into the water to see where it can flow. The younger ones, smiling, follow the small paper boats floating on the water, walking along the quiet path, through the mountain valleys.

In my reverie, why couldn't that be a grand river? The river center is uneven, and the river flows there, turning all kinds of flowers and turning in different directions. Then there is a loud sound, but I am alone by the river, gazing intently. Suddenly I have the thought of wading across the water, how can I get to the other shore, there is no boat here? I am anxious, grabbing my head with my hands. Because I felt pain, I realized that what was in front of me was just a small mountain stream, and I could cross to the other side with just one step. I smiled.

When I looked up, I didn't know when the people who came with me had dispersed. So I walked alone towards the path up the small mountain. In this quiet mountain path, I saw pairs of men and women leaning against each other. I was indifferent, sweating slightly, wetting my hair.

A burst of wooden fish sounds came over, so I walked towards that side. Finally, I walked to the main hall with a door open, stepped over the high threshold, and saw several monks in cassocks kneeling in front of the statue. The low and devout voice touched my heart, and I took off my hat.

Many thoughts were swimming in my chest like fish. I walked out of the hall door blankly and sat down on the stone bench in front of the door, hugging my knees with my hands, staring blankly ahead.

The shadow of the tree drew the trunks for the fallen flowers on the ground. I imagined the plum blossoms that bloomed white on the branches, as if they were shining in my eyes again. I looked happily, but suddenly a loud voice pierced my ears:

"Ah! I didn't expect you to be sitting here alone!"

I looked up at him and found his hurried appearance a little funny. I didn't answer him, just nodded.

"We're waiting for you alone, we're about to go back."

"Are we going back?"—I stood up lazily with a heart full of attachment: Repeatedly looking at a tree with all the flowers fallen, and the flowers that fell from the tree all over the ground.

It's really hasty!—I sighed and followed the person behind me.

### March Loneliness

— Leon

When the warm spring breeze and gorgeous sunshine sprinkle on the world. People are grateful for the holy grace, happiness ah happiness! The water in the pond smiled in the spring breeze, slowly, slowly, flowing the clear sky in March, and the pond water was filled with soft azure blue.

The clear sky in March is vast, with white clouds floating, bathing in spring water, floating, transforming, and disappearing below the outlines of uneven buildings.

There are people on the street selling peeled tender yams, spring bamboo shoots, and wolfberry vines. Fresh seasonal products are only the good fortune of those gluttons. In this season, most of them suffer from stomach weakness, and their nourishment is the warm sunshine outside the window, the gentle flowing wind, and some abstract products of the natural world.

Everywhere there are iron pillars and stone walls, life is really suppressed and depressed. In a world like a stone pavement covered with steel plates, finding a sprout on a flower is like dreaming of fishing for the moon at the bottom of the water. The daily calendar with a strong smell of ink has been bringing spring to the world day by day, but even the park has not been visited. People who are ground by life all day long and isolated from nature are very indifferent to the change of seasons.

Bright sunshine from the bright glass window, one or two sparrows are singing a clear song under the eaves, the red plum branch seen at the corner of the wall is withering, and the petals are falling. A subconscious thought, a trace of sadness, a moment of feeling lost. Ah, March, March is lonely!

When the bright March sunshine is covered by coal smoke into a dark shade, when the birdsong is frightened away by the whistle, when the fallen flowers and branches are swept away by the cleaners, has spring arrived before your eyes? Are there any other examples of spring? Searching, anytime and anywhere, but always disappointed.

But this day was an accident. In a vegetable market filled with a fishy smell, I discovered the reporter of spring - yellow rapeseed flowers. So my heart couldn't help but be secretly overjoyed. In the vendor's bamboo basket, bundles and bundles were neatly piled up. The small yellow flowers clustered into balls, the light green stamens, and the emerald green buds, piled up like beads, revealed the mysterious gestation of nature in the subtle, "Seeing the world in a grain of sand," Leike's philosophy was deeply engraved on the heart version. The dew contained in the yellow flowers and emerald green buds, illuminated by the sun, emitted a crystal clear light, so I felt dazzled in front of me. Is the crystal clearness of the water droplets between the rapeseed flowers, or in my own eyes? Even the nerve sensation is blurred, and a little moistness is in my heart.

Although it is the clear and bright March in front of me, I have a heart like a rainy day.

The heart of a rainy day is lonely, the sunshine in March is lonely, like a young widow imprisoned in an ancient nunnery, unable to bear the shackles of her nature. The vitality is locked into a dark and desperate environment. It is time now, and a suitable key is needed, or a sledgehammer is also straightforward. Some fire is needed, or the power of some explosives is also possible. I want to open the warehouse of the dull environment, I want to illuminate the darkness here and there, I want to explode all the imprisoned vitality, I will finally drive away the loneliness that is sinking to the bottom of life....

"I am not a prisoner of the season," I ruled myself like this.

But the deep alley in the daytime of March is entirely surrounded by loneliness, and even the footsteps of the dog walking by can be heard clearly. The white sun smears the high wall, just like the white face of an anemic patient. The jujube tree across the wall still protrudes its withered branches. March has not yet seen new green. I don't know who is playing the piano again. Every note is trembling. March, it's spring, why do you need this sad tune! It calls people to close their hearts and gives people a feeling of bleakness! This unbearable loneliness in March needs a heavy bomb.
