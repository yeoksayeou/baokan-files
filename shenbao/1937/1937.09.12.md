### Enemy Attempts All-Out Assault on Yangxing and Yuepu

Breakthrough at a Certain Point on My Yangxing First Line. Our Troops Actively Counterattack, Demonstrating Superiority. Enemy Concentrates Bombardment, Causing Minimal Damage to Us.

A reporter from this newspaper inspected the front lines at □□□□ and other locations last night at 7:00 PM and returned to the office at 2:00 AM this morning. The battle situation in Luodian was relatively quiet. The enemy's naval gun sounds in Yangxing and Yuepu also gradually became sparse last night. The artillery fire in Wusong was dense, and enemy aircraft were extremely active in Zhabei. The reporter met with various military officers, and the comprehensive discussions and battle situations from all parties are as follows: ㊀ The enemy initially attempted to use the old tactic of flanking from the left and right wings, employing full force to attack Luodian, attempting to extend its left wing and create a large encirclement of our troops. As a result, the enemy in Luodian was surrounded, and this military plan had to be abandoned. They switched to a central breakthrough strategy. For four days, the enemy has been launching all-out offensives from the sea, land, and air in the central areas of Zhanghuabang, Wusong, Yuepu, and Yangxing, intending to break through any point on our central lines to cut off our communication. Enemy warships and heavy artillery are concentrated on a certain location, conducting intense suppressive fire to destroy the traffic for our reinforcement troops' movement. However, as of now, the enemy's concentrated bombardment has caused minimal damage to our military. The breakthrough points have only advanced or retreated by a few hundred meters, which is truly not worth the cost. The enemy's plan has clearly suffered an unexpected and serious blow. ㊁ The enemy's concentrated bombardment of Yuepu, Yangxing, and other locations has continued day and night for the past few days, totaling tens of thousands of shells. Since 2:00 PM today (i.e., yesterday), the artillery fire suddenly became sparse, which may be a symbol of another change in the enemy's plan. ㊂ Our front line in Yuepu has remained unchanged from beginning to end. In Yangxing, after two days and nights of fierce fighting, a certain point on the first line east of Yangxing Town was broken through by the enemy. Our fresh troops have arrived and are counterattacking, and the battle situation is absolutely unaffected. Yangxing Town is still in our hands. ㊃ In Wusong, the enemy and we are still in a standoff at Miaocun, and the enemy's development is particularly difficult. ㊄ In Zhabei, in order to support the offensive on the Wusong-Baoshan line, the enemy has been harassing with small units for several days. We are firmly defending the original front line, which is irrelevant to the overall situation.

### Our Counterattack in Yangxing is Quite Successful

Fierce Fighting Still Underway, We Hold the Advantage, and it is Expected that the Original Position Will Be Recovered Soon

Central News Agency reports: Midnight report, ㊀ Yesterday's front-line battles were most intense in the Yuepu Town and Yangxing Town line. In Yangxing, our army's first-line position was broken through by the enemy yesterday afternoon. By sunset, we launched a fierce counterattack with fresh troops, and fierce fighting is still underway. Our army is very successful, clearly holding the advantage, and it is hoped that the original position will be recovered and the enemy's westward advance will be blocked. ㊁ In Luodian, our army has adopted a steady and solid, step-by-step strategy. There have been no major battles in recent days. From yesterday morning, in order to coordinate with the enemy troops attacking Yangxing and Yuepu, the enemy launched an offensive on our front with reinforcements from the Xiaochuansha area, attempting to break through. However, our army had already constructed a solid encircling position. The enemy forces repeatedly charged fiercely but were repelled. From morning to night, the battle continued fiercely without stopping. Because the enemy adopted an offensive stance, hundreds of people were killed or wounded. Our army's position, however, remained unchanged. The night before last, our air force came to Shanghai to attack enemy warships. One bomb hit an enemy warship, causing heavy damage. Yesterday, on the surface of the Huangpu River at Yangshupu Dinghai Road, an enemy warship was found to have completely sunk, leaving only a chimney on the surface of the river. It was said that it was the one hit by our plane the night before last. The enemy forces repeatedly attempted to land in Pudong without success. They are now planning to dispatch a large number of speedboats and plainclothes teams to harass our rear. We have already locked the Wuzhen Road Bridge and the Laji Bridge to prevent enemy attacks.

After the enemy's plan to attack the city center and break through our Gonglu defense line failed, they have been concentrating all their efforts to attack our Yuepu-Yangxing line, advancing from Wusong and Baoshan in two directions. For two days, an unprecedented bloody battle has taken place with our army on that line. Our army has fought bravely, advancing wave upon wave. Even under the enemy's dense artillery fire and tank charges, they have stood firm and refused to retreat. At dawn yesterday, enemy warships concentrated their firepower and fiercely bombarded our positions near the northeast of Yuepu and Yangxing in Baoshan. At the same time, more than ten tanks advanced along the Baoyang Highway, with their infantry units using the tanks as cover. Our front-line troops responded calmly. When they advanced to near the Eastern Bridge of Yangxing, our mortar teams at that location immediately concentrated their firepower and launched a fierce attack on the enemy tanks. Under our dense artillery fire, four enemy vehicles were immediately destroyed. Our defending soldiers bravely rushed out and used machine guns and grenades to attack the invading infantry. The enemy was forced to retreat. On the left wing of our Yangxing position, more than a thousand enemy infantrymen were also discovered attacking us at dawn yesterday, supporting the enemy in the central route. Our troops there bravely resisted the enemy. Yesterday, the entire line was plunged into an extremely fierce bloody battle.

Central News Agency reports: Since the enemy forces landed at the Qiujiang Wharf, they have implemented a central breakthrough, attempting to establish contact between Yangshupu and Zhanghuabang. As a result of days of fierce fighting, the enemy forces suffered a disastrous defeat and retreated into the Qiujiang Wharf. They suffered heavy casualties and had no counter-offensive power. The enemy had no choice but to change their strategy. Starting yesterday morning, they attacked our Yangxing and Yuepu areas, attempting to open up the Wusong and Luodian line. From morning to noon, enemy warships concentrated their firepower and continuously bombarded us. At the same time, large enemy forces advanced towards our Yangxing and Yuepu areas under the cover of artillery fire, with tanks as the vanguard. Our army bravely resisted and fought fiercely all day. The enemy in the Yuepu area was repelled by our army, while the first-line position of our army in the Yangxing area was eventually broken through by the enemy. Our army is now awaiting reinforcements and preparing to launch a counterattack on the enemy under the cover of night.

### Fierce Fighting in the Miaocun Area Yesterday

Our Troops Launch a Fierce Attack, Enemy Lines Waver

The enemy in Wusong launched an all-out attack yesterday, attempting to coordinate with the enemy in the central route attacking Yangxing. Aircraft and warships came fiercely. Our troops divided their efforts to meet the attack, charging and engaging in close combat to contend with them. At 5:00 AM yesterday morning, they attacked our army's right flank position near Zhangjiacun, advancing to near Zhangjiacun and Wujiacun. Our troops stationed in Miaocun rushed to respond, and an extremely fierce battle broke out. Yesterday, the enemy and our troops remained in a stalemate in the Miaocun area. The battle continued last night. Our fresh troops have joined the battle and are launching a fierce attack on the enemy, and the enemy lines have wavered.

Central News Agency reports: The enemy in Wusong suddenly launched an all-out offensive yesterday, with aircraft assisting in the battle, wantonly dropping bombs. Our army temporarily retreated to avoid their sharp edge. The enemy did not dare to penetrate deeply. That evening, we divided our troops and launched a night attack along both sides of the highway near Yangcun, passing through the area between Liujiazhai Xinmu Bridge and Taojiazhai. The enemy had not yet gained a firm foothold and was attacked by us, and immediately collapsed and retreated. By about 12:00 AM, we had recovered our original position. Before long, the enemy attacked again with their main force, with a strong force of about two battalions, attacking our right flank position near Zhangjiacun, occupying the Zhangjiacun and Wujiazhai area and confronting our troops in Miaocun. We are urgently deploying a large army, preparing to strike them hard.

### More Than Four Hundred Enemies Eliminated at Zhanghuabang

Three Attacks Repelled. The Enemy Suffered Heavy Casualties in Our Pincer Attack.

(Special report from this newspaper) The enemy in the Zhanghuabang and Yunzaobang area launched a fierce attack on our city center area positions throughout the night yesterday, with six armored vehicles as the vanguard, followed closely by more than four hundred elite infantrymen carrying light machine guns. Our army, responsible for that area, was the □□□ division. Initially, upon seeing the enemy attack, all of them lay in ambush without moving. When the enemy advanced to a considerable distance, they launched a joint attack. Seeing that the situation was not good, the enemy, fearing that their vehicles would be heavily besieged, hurriedly opened full speed and fled in panic. However, the more than four hundred infantrymen who provided cover for the attack were intercepted by us and completely annihilated.

(Central News Agency) The enemy in Yunzaobang and Zhanghuabang was repelled by us to the east of Nantang, along the coastal area. Our army built fortifications on the west bank of Sitang, with solid fortifications and deep trenches. The enemy repeatedly attempted to attack, but has not succeeded. Therefore, the front lines in that area have remained unchanged for several days. At dawn yesterday, they attacked us again, using artillery fire as cover, with their main force advancing along Yunzaobang, attacking our positions at Heicunzhai and Shenjiazhai. Our army bravely resisted. The enemy knew we were prepared and did not dare to advance lightly, and immediately collapsed and retreated. At 10:00 AM, they launched another fierce attack with multiple tanks followed by a large number of infantry. We responded calmly and encircled their rear from both wings, killing countless enemies. The enemy finally could not support it, abandoned their vehicles and collapsed and retreated. The enemy launched two attacks without success, and then, starting at noon, concentrated naval guns and aircraft firepower to bombard fiercely until evening. At the same time, they mobilized three light tanks and two medium tanks to launch another surprise attack on the Xiaoxuzhai area. We intercepted them with mortars and grenades, inflicting heavy damage. In the Hei Yangzhai area, three enemy tanks protected infantry who broke into our lines and were active in our position for several hours. Our army dispersed and lay in ambush, aiming and shooting. The enemy fell to the ground one after another, suffering heavy casualties and no longer having the ability to hold their ground in the breakthrough position. Therefore, they retreated in a disheveled manner. In this battle, the enemy launched three attacks and fought fiercely all day, but was ultimately repelled, leaving many corpses behind.

Yesterday, the enemy in Wusong and Zhanghuabang established contact with the enemy on Binshan and, using tanks as cover, invaded in three routes, attempting to advance in a fan shape. ㊀ The enemy advanced from Binshan to spy on Yuepu. At about 5:00 AM yesterday morning, the two armies made contact at Tanjiamiao. Our army rose up to respond, and the artillery fire was very fierce. Until noon, both sides suffered casualties. Our front line advanced to Dingjiaqiao. ㊁ The enemy in Wusong used four tanks to cover infantry and launched a fierce attack on our position, breaking through Sanguantang and directly approaching Jucun along the Songyang Road. Our army resisted with bloodshed and used mortars to destroy three tanks, killing many enemies. They were preparing to rush out of the trenches to encircle them, but the enemy reinforced with more than a thousand people, swarming in from Songbin Road, joining the attack. Our army firmly defended the eastern suburbs of Yangxing, waiting for an opportunity to attack. ㊂ The enemy troops on the Zhanghuabang road also used three light tanks to break into Nantang River, Heiqiao Shenjiazhai, Xiaoxuzhai and other places at 7:00 AM yesterday morning. Because there were many rivers in that area, the tanks were blocked and could not advance. Therefore, the enemy troops following behind suffered extremely heavy casualties in our pincer attack. After our army won the victory, they seized quite a few enemy weapons.

### Luodian Enemy Forces Retreat Immediately After Counterattack

In Luodian, the enemy in front of our army looked like they were attempting to launch a counterattack to coordinate with the enemy in Yangxing. Starting at dawn yesterday, the enemy used heavy artillery to bombard our Caowangmiao position non-stop for about an hour, then the artillery fire became sparse. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy artillery started again and was stopped soon after our artillery gave it a return fire. A small number of enemy troops were discovered in our Caowangmiao position and were surrounded by our troops, killing an enemy major and seizing many documents and maps. South of Chenhuabang, about two kilometers from Yuepu, the enemy in the Linjiazhai area attempted to counterattack our position between Pu'angqiao and Yuepu yesterday, but was met with a head-on blow by our army and retreated.

### Enemy Establishes Headquarters in Xiaochuansha

Confirmed information: In Chuansha Town, northeast of Luodian, the enemy troops, colluding with traitors, have established a headquarters there. Our military authorities have been paying close attention to this.

Central News Agency reports: The enemy in Luodian has always been under our encirclement, and although they have attempted to break through several times, they have not succeeded. It is now learned that a large number of enemy troops landed in the Xiaochuansha and Shidongkou areas yesterday, preparing to attack us in order to relieve the siege of Luodian. However, our forces are strong, and if the enemy attacks, we will resolutely give them a head-on blow.

### Enemy Forces Attempt to Attack Liuhe Again

Central News Agency reports: There are about seven or eight hundred enemy troops southeast of Liuhe Town. They came surging forward the night before last (the 10th), attempting to attack. Our sentries discovered them and returned to the camp to report. Troops were immediately dispatched to intercept them and repel them. The enemy seems to be probing our army's strength and will launch a large-scale attack in the coming days, but we have made careful preparations. If the enemy attacks, we will give them a counterattack.

### Our Air Force Conducted Two Night Raids Yesterday

Our air force flew to Shanghai for a night raid at 7:15 PM yesterday. In the midst of concentrated enemy anti-aircraft fire, they calmly flew over the Huangpu River and dropped multiple bombs on enemy positions in the Yangshupu area. The enemy suffered considerable damage. Our aircraft turned back at about 7:30 PM, circled once over the Huangpu River, and then safely left Shanghai and returned. At 10:35 PM in the evening, our air force flew to Shanghai again. Enemy warships hurriedly fired anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns indiscriminately, and then sent planes to take off and engage our planes in a fierce battle, firing machine guns at each other. For a time, sparks flew in the air and gunshots were incessant. The battle stopped after about half an hour. Our aircraft safely flew back.

### Enemy Aircraft Drop Bombs on Nanshi and Pudong

According to information from the Seventh Rescue Team of the Red Cross, at 10:35 PM, several Japanese aircraft bombed Liyuan Road in southern Shanghai. Nearby houses immediately caught fire, and smoke filled the sky. The Seventh Team of the Red Cross rescued two seriously injured people, Shen Jinshan and Chen Zhongyi, from the flames. Both were in critical condition. Two bombs landed at Haichao Temple but fortunately did not explode. The monks of the temple removed the bombs. At about 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, two enemy aircraft flew over the Republic Road at the junction of Fahua and scattered leaflets with absurd wording. All of them were torn up by passers-by.

According to villagers in Pudong, several enemy aircraft flew to Beicai and Yanjiaqiao in Pudong yesterday morning and dropped bombs, destroying many civilian houses, but there were no casualties.

### Large Number of Enemy Aircraft Flew Out Yesterday

The enemy has expanded the original golf course east of the Gonda Spinning Factory at the end of Yangshupu Road and converted it into a temporary airfield, which is the largest base for enemy air force activities in Shanghai. It is learned that there are dozens of enemy aircraft stationed at the field. Four red lights and a small flag are placed near the Shanghai Textile Association on the side of the field as a target for enemy aircraft to take off and land. At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, more than thirty enemy aircraft flew out of the airfield. Eighteen of them flew to the Yunzaobang area, while the rest circled the airfield, flying so low that if you stood on the roof platform, you could almost reach out and grab them. The number was like dragonflies in autumn. At about 4:00 PM in the afternoon, the planes gradually flew back one after another.

### Enemy Position Covered with Bullet Marks

The enemy positions in the eastern district of Shanghai have suffered considerable losses in recent days after being bombarded by our air force and heavy artillery. In order to understand the actual situation of the wharves along the Huangpu River and the true state of the enemy's losses, the reporter departed from the Bund yesterday afternoon and went to the Huangpu River to inspect the area. Along the way, the roof of the Japanese Consulate on the north bank of the Suzhou River was hit by two bombs, and the side of the building was hit by one bomb. The roof of the warehouse next to the consulate was hit by a giant bomb, and the side of the building was hit by two bombs. Part of the goods in the warehouse had been burned, and almost all the glass windows of the warehouse were broken. The Japan Mail Wharf was hit by two bombs, causing severe damage. The roof of the warehouse at the Gonghexiang Wharf was hit by one bomb, and another warehouse was half burned. A warehouse in front of the Osaka Wharf was destroyed by bombing. In summary, only the Huishan, Huangpu, Osaka, and Huashun wharves were relatively intact. The rest were covered with bullet marks and were clearly visible.

### The North China Daily News Published "Letter from a Shanghai Woman" Paying Tribute to Chinese Courage

Japanese Actions Prove Their Cruelty and Jealousy. Success or Failure Lies in Ourselves. Hope We Take Care of Ourselves.

The North China Daily News published a letter yesterday signed "A Shanghai Woman," titled "A Salute to Chinese Courage." The letter reads: I must first congratulate your newspaper. Your "Three Words and Two Sentences" column is humorous and appropriate. The record by a gentleman in this morning’s article about the definitions of several words in the Japanese dictionary is different from other countries, and can be described as nailing it. This is indeed the real situation. If the Japanese can see themselves as others see them, they will know that they are nothing more than bullies, braggarts, self-contradictory people, and cowards. Their air force can avoid anti-aircraft fire and the pursuit of fighter planes and soar freely in the sky. How brave is that? Above is the vast blue sky, and below is a large group of defenseless refugees. Is that really brave? It's just disgusting! On the other hand, a lonely Chinese attacker, (note, he is attacking in his own country), under the full treatment of the Japanese Navy, knowing that fierce artillery fire will put them to death, still risks flying up. This is truly a courageous act, a bold aviator! I would like to pay my respects to you. The Japanese army has everything in an advantageous position, and it is very easy to get what they want. What they destroyed is not the land in their own country. They have complete mechanized forces, controlling the sea, land, and even the public concession. Gai Yangshupu and Hongkou are both part of the concession. However, the Japanese naval authorities did not say a word of politeness, but ordered people of the two districts, including Americans, Austrians, Belgians, Chinese, French, Germans, Greeks, Italians, Russians, Swedes, Danes, and Norwegians, to leave their homes, threatening them with "If you don't, you will die." If I have not misread the newspaper, the people of the aforementioned countries cannot move an inch without notifying the Japanese authorities and obtaining their permission. Other headlines such as "Warnings to Foreign Ships" and "Foreign Ships Will Be Bombarded" are often seen. In this case, can it be considered that there is still no war and that we are still free people? Alas, our country has abandoned us, and the horrors of war have made us all cowards. "Non-war warfare," what does this mean? Isn't it a shocking farce? Many of the poor refugees have committed suicide. This is not surprising, because this is the only way to escape the tragic world where might is right. Justice has been extinguished for a long time. The Japanese naval minister dared to stand up and make an astonishing joke: "The Japanese Imperial Navy will never take inhumane actions under any circumstances." The Japanese Navy will never admit its mistakes, but every move they make is enough to prove their cruelty and jealousy (the reason why they bombed art landmarks and cultural institutions is nothing more than jealousy) and cowardice (if they are not cowards, why do they have to use part of the concession as a cover and park their warships between neutral countries' ships as a shield?). The Japanese accuse the Chinese army of misusing the Red Cross and other flags, but how can they explain their tyrannical confiscation of foreigners' property (including national flags)? Alas, of course, they are Japanese and can be forgiven. The only truth that can be found in Japan's statement about this "accidental incident" is the statement "We want China to kneel." I came to Shanghai in 1905 and have never seen a real fact that raises China's position and helps China reach the peak it has reached today. What Japan wants is for China to kneel in the dirt, and they have held this ambition for a long time. Japan has no feelings for China. They see China as a weak enemy that can be beaten at will. But is it so easy? Japan has now encountered a united China. If it is given sincere assistance, China will soon become a respected country. Japan thinks that China has made great progress in recent years and has too many Japanese friends. Poor China, what is the value of friendship? It's just empty words. Many individuals often realize this after experiencing painful experiences. China, as a country, will also realize that you yourselves are the best of friends. Poor China, success or failure lies in yourselves. Hope you take care of yourselves. From a woman in Shanghai.

The "definition of several words in the Japanese dictionary" referred to in the letter, the original letter is as follows: There seem to be different boundaries in Japanese dictionaries from other countries. A Japanese student once looked up the dictionary and found the following items: "Accidental Incident" is a dispute with a neighboring country, and it costs us one million pounds. "Sincerity" is a characteristic unique to us, so only we know its meaning. "Cooperation 1" is the action taken by other countries after we have made our meaning clear with bombs, shells, and bayonets. "Self-defense" is (war), which is completely done outside our country's territory. "War" There is no such word in the dictionary, because Japan has signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact and never resorts to force under any circumstances, so there is no need for this word. "Non-combatant" There is no such word in the dictionary either. "The Army and Navy are fully responsible for maintaining law and order and are not sponsored when they do their duty." "Prime Minister" is a complete flatterer of the Army and Navy. "Treaty" is something that China must abide by. "Philanthropist" Only the meaning of this word is the same as the word in other countries, and another boundary is to help the needs of neutrals and enemies for humanitarian reasons.

### Enemy Aircraft Bombard Longhua Temple

Fifty to Sixty Civilians Killed or Wounded, Beiqiao Elementary School Also Bombed

(Special report from this newspaper) At 9:30 AM yesterday, five enemy aircraft flew to Longhua in southern Shanghai and wantonly bombed, dropping more than twenty bombs in total. Nine bombs landed in and around Longhua Temple. The temple gate was destroyed, and more than half of the Daxiong Hall in the temple was destroyed. One corner of the roof was hit by a bomb. The three Buddhas in the hall were not damaged, but the small Buddhas on both sides and the five hundred Arhats in the left wing were all looted. The empty house on the right side of the temple and the police station on the left corner were also affected, as well as a dozen civilian houses behind the temple. About fifty to sixty civilians were killed or wounded. Police Chief Wang Biao and three police officers were seriously injured. Apart from some of the seriously injured being taken to hospitals in the Special Zone for treatment, Hua Laowu, 41 years old, a local resident, was seriously injured in the head; Xu Diqing, 18 years old, a local resident, was seriously injured in the chest and right leg; Zhang Zuhai, 24 years old, from Shandong, was slightly injured in the right leg. The above-mentioned people were sent to Tongren Hospital, and the rest were sent to Zhongshan Hospital in western Shanghai. A police officer was seriously injured in the left waist and left abdomen. A Buddhist woman in the Nanshi branch of the Red Cross was seriously injured and died. Four people who were killed by the collapse were identified by their families and taken for burial at the time. Xi Tongsheng, Zhang Mazi, a rickshaw driver, and a crushed child's corpse were sent by personnel from Tongren Fuyuantang to be buried. More than ten monks in the temple were injured. Residents in Longhua Town have now moved away completely. Only the whole town was fortunate enough not to be killed. The enemy aircraft was still not satisfied after this massacre and flew to Beiqiao in Minhang and dropped seven or eight bombs. Beiqiao Elementary School was also bombed. Most of the residents in that area have already moved away, so only three or four people were injured.

### China National Aviation Corporation Aircraft Did Not Carry Bombs to Shanghai

Japanese Reports are Purely Fictitious

[Nanjing] Regarding the statement made by a certain Japanese spokesman in Shanghai to foreign reporters that a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Douglas aircraft had recently carried bombs to Shanghai, the reporter inquired with the person in charge of the CNAC Nanjing office. According to their discussion, CNAC is a Sino-American joint venture, and its organizational nature would absolutely not allow such a thing to happen. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, the company's Shanghai-Beiping route has been suspended, and the Douglas aircraft were sent to the factory for repairs. Only one aircraft was repaired by the 10th and has been specifically selected for use on the Hankou-Chongqing route. There was no eastward flight, and the Ming Palace Airport has not yet been completed. It has been almost five months since a CNAC Douglas aircraft landed in Nanjing, which is a fact that everyone has seen. What the Japanese said is purely fictitious.

### He Huansan of Guangxi Donates Rent to Resist Japan

Resist the war for ten years, donate for ten years, resist the war to the end, donate to the end.

Wuzhou Correspondence, He Huansan, a villager in Xiling Township, Gongcheng County, recently felt that the national crisis was extreme and was filled with righteous indignation. He specially donated all of his fields, 300 dan of rent grain from his annual income, for military expenses to resist Japan. He decided that if the war of resistance lasts for ten years, he will donate for ten years, and if the war of resistance lasts to the end, he will donate to the end. He will find another way to make a living. This spirit of sacrificing his family to relieve national difficulties is truly admirable, and the righteous act of long-term support is unprecedented. Zhu Rubiao, the head of the township, has already submitted a request to the county government to forward it to the provincial government for commendation and to forward it to the national government for commendation to encourage others.

### Hurricane Hits Japan

Floods Inundate and Wash Away Houses; Ships Lost and Transportation Halted

[Tokyo] A hurricane hit Japan today, followed by flooding. The disaster area is vast, and the damage to transportation lines, ships, villages, and cities is enormous.

### Our Country Submits a Supplementary Statement of Complaint to the League of Nations

The United States Prepares to Send Personnel to Attend the Advisory Committee; Our Ambassadors Gu and Guo Arrive in Geneva

[Nanjing] Since the Lugouqiao Incident, I have submitted a statement to the League of Nations on the situation in which Japan has acted, and the full text has been seen in yesterday's newspaper. However, Japan has continued to advance and not only advance but also invade. Our government submitted a supplementary statement on the 10th and telegraphed Representative Gu Weijun to appeal to the League of Nations again. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will publish this supplementary statement at noon on the 12th. (Special dispatch, 11th)

[Geneva] Regarding the war between China and Japan, the Advisory Committee established by the League of Nations Temporary General Assembly in 1933 will deal with it. Chinese personnel here believe that there are three benefits to adopting this procedure: ⑴ The question of designating the aggressor nation can be resolved naturally without discussion, as the League of Nations Temporary General Assembly in 1933 has already unanimously recognized Japan as the aggressor nation. ⑵ As a result, the dispute between China and Japan can be automatically submitted to the current session of the League of Nations General Assembly for handling and exert the greatest effect. ⑶ Since the United States is one of the member states of the Advisory Committee, it can participate in the matter. These people also said that the Mediterranean Conference is wrongly discussing the principle of mutual assistance, and Western European countries are also making every effort to maintain the collective security mechanism. Therefore, China's appeal to the League of Nations is well-timed. (Havas Telegraph, 10th)

[Washington] State Department officials announced today that when the League of Nations discusses China's appeal, the United States will send informal observers or reporters to attend. The person has not yet been determined, but it is likely that the most recent consul will be responsible for listening and collecting information. (National Telegraph, 10th)

### Russian Newspaper Satirizes Japan

Clay Feet Are Unreliable

[Moscow] The Izvestia newspaper wrote, "The China incident has indeed made the Japanese military at a loss. Although Tokyo insists that Japan is not waging war in China, but only carrying out a 'disciplinary action' in order to 'restore the sanity of the Chinese and return to good terms with Japan,' in reality a major war has indeed broken out, and it has broken out at a time when the Japanese military was not prepared, and not at a location it had planned in advance. The China incident is indeed a large-scale war." The newspaper finally continued, "The Japanese military is making sacrifices beyond the strength of its people's and national finances in order to 'cope with this extraordinary time,' but the Sino-Japanese War will inevitably prove that in our era, a pair of clay feet is definitely not a reliable basis for conducting a large-scale war, even if its enemy is a country that has only recently completed national unification. The result will still be the same." (Tass Telegraph, 10th)

### Japan's Reply to the U.S. Note

Shifts Responsibility for Compensation; The U.S. Expresses Dissatisfaction

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull previously sent notes to China and Japan, asking them to be responsible for compensating the losses of American people's lives and property in China. How Japan responded to this note is still unknown. When reporters visited Hull, they clearly pointed out that Japan had no intention of accepting the U.S. note, but Hull was unwilling to express his opinion and refused to disclose whether Japan had replied to the U.S. According to those familiar with politics, Hull's attitude shows that Tokyo's reply was extremely unsatisfactory. According to reliable sources in Japan, Tokyo's reply only stated that it was willing to give full consideration to the U.S. note, but it made no mention of taking responsibility for compensation. As in the "January 28th" incident, Japan has never officially recognized this point, although there have been some cases of factual compensation. (National Telegraph, 10th)

### Fujian Province Prepares for Long-Term Resistance

Increase Production - Awaken the People - Control Traffic - Save Waste

Fuzhou Correspondence, the people of Fujian province, in order to prevent surprise attacks by enemy aircraft, mostly moved to the countryside, and most shops were also closed. Now, the provincial government believes that at this extraordinary time, the people in the rear should intensify their work and actively engage in production as a preparation for resisting the enemy. It has ordered all shops to resume business, increase production, and leave the strong men in the provincial capital to undertake various wartime tasks to avoid wasting professions and consuming time. Therefore, the shops in the city have resumed business one after another, and the city scene has gradually returned to its original state. Women and children who moved to the countryside are also returning to school one after another because the elementary schools have reopened. The Anti-Enemy Support Association, in order to awaken the people, unite and sacrifice for the country, and to instill knowledge such as air defense and rescue, has established 100 short-term public schools, borrowing various schools or cultural socks and public places as school sites. Each household should recommend one person to go to school to listen to lectures, and the police station will send police to supervise. The class time for each school is set at 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM every night. Those who are absent from class for one-third of the time must listen again. The listening time for each period is temporarily set at five days until the entire city's people are trained. As for the traffic control in this province, the plan is now in place. Steamships and cars will be compiled into a general team. In the future, all people who travel by steamship to the upper reaches of the Minjiang River should first obtain a certificate from the Fujian Travel Agency and exchange it for a release certificate from the General Team Headquarters of the ship. If they do not obtain a release certificate, they will not be allowed to attach. On the administrative side, the provincial government has cut down unimportant institutions such as water conservancy, roads, electricity, mines, and various offices, and unimportant projects such as the provincial capital's natural eternity and the electrical plants in the counties have been suspended to save waste and prepare for long-term resistance. At the same time, it has telegraphed the municipal and county governments and various collection bureaus and offices to collect various taxes in the county and province, no matter how little, they should be deposited into the treasury in accordance with the regulations, not deposited, and not affect the urgent needs. The Finance Department will send people to check at any time. If there is any borrowing of names, tax payments or private acceptance or misappropriation, or if there is any corruption or bribery, whether large or small, once verified, they will be punished in accordance with military law. There will be no leniency.

### Taiwanese People Buy Rice in Wenling

Greedy Merchants Only Know Profit and Sell in Large Numbers; Taiwanese People Also Use Private Goods to Exchange for Rice

Taizhou Correspondence, the southeast and west regions of Wenling are located on the coast, with convenient sea transportation. Since the Shanghai war, rice merchants of Taiwanese nationality have suddenly sailed ships to anchor on the coast and sent people into the interior to buy rice at high prices. However, there are unruly township chiefs who do not report the situation and allow them to secretly buy and smuggle exports. Shizhang, Songmen, and Jinqinggang, which are five or sixty li away from the city, have been loaded and exported one after another. Shachantang, Jiangxia, and Wugen, which are ten li away from the city, Dali and other places have recently discovered that the vessels from the affiliated Pishan and other suspended islands are sold to Taiwanese rice merchants, who make huge profits.

It is also heard that Taiwanese rice merchants are buying rice in Pishan, and not exchanging it for cash, but exchanging it for white sugar, kerosene, etc. Two bags of rice can be exchanged for four bags of white sugar, and two bushels of rice can be exchanged for one can of kerosene. There are many enemies of rice exchanges.

### Steps for Reorganizing Finance in Guizhou Province

Four Major Banks to Purchase Guizhou Currency, to be Replaced by National Currency Upon Completion

Guangzhou Dispatch: Guizhou Province is currently undertaking financial reorganization to fundamentally reform the Guizhou currency system. The reorganization method involves starting with the recall of Guizhou currency. After consultation with the Ministry of Finance, the four major banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China) are responsible for the recall. Initially, the exchange rate is set at two Guizhou currency units for one national currency unit, i.e., five jiao of national currency buys one yuan of Guizhou currency. This is a provisional purchase price. When a certain percentage of Guizhou currency has been recalled, the Ministry of Finance will determine the official exchange rate between national currency and Guizhou currency. The purchase of Guizhou currency is handled by the Guangzhou branch of the Bank of China, publicly designated by the four major banks. The buying and selling of Guizhou currency is conducted daily from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The amount of buying and selling is determined based on the circumstances. To ensure that holders of Guizhou currency sell in sequence, a limit is set on the maximum amount that each seller can sell per day, which is 10,000 yuan of Guizhou currency. Serial numbers are assigned to the sales orders, and no additional sales are allowed. Sellers holding Guizhou currency must register in advance to arrange the order of sale. After purchasing the Guizhou currency, the Bank of China issues receipts, and the purchase price (in national currency) is paid the next morning. Sellers holding Guizhou currency must trade in Guizhou currency spot, and delivery on the following day is not allowed. From August 16th to 25th, the Guangzhou branch of the Bank of China purchased over five million yuan of Guizhou currency. After a considerable period of time and a reduction in the quantity of Guizhou currency, the statutory rate between national currency and Guizhou currency will be determined. After some more time, Guizhou Province will be able to completely recall Guizhou currency and replace it with national currency. The reorganization steps are divided into three phases.

### Japanese Transportation and Fuel During the War

— Yi Zang

The panic caused by our full-scale war of resistance against Japan among the Japanese industrial circles is, needless to say, great. Now, I will briefly explain the situation in the two aspects most closely related to the military, namely transportation and fuel.

㊀ Transportation: The Japanese shipping industry was immediately and severely affected after the Lugouqiao Incident. The Ministry of Communications first promulgated the Foreign Vessel and Kwantung Leased Territory Vessel Coastal Route Permit System, and at the same time implemented emergency measures such as controlling the charter market, opening coastal routes, and changing the allocation of ships. However, it is actually very difficult to make the number of coastal ships meet the needs. Although the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry considered the transportation of goods, prioritizing urgency, and devoted all their efforts to adjusting ships, various industries strongly opposed it, and the Maritime Autonomy League could not cooperate with the order. Most ships, due to the risk of being requisitioned and confiscated, changed their registration and transportation direction, and went to Siam and other safe areas. The government cannot prevent this evasion behavior. Recently, due to the expansion of the war, the panic in the shipping industry has become even more profound.

㊁ Fuel: The day after the North China Incident occurred, the coal produced by the Kailuan Coal Mine and the Zhongxing Coal Mine in our country was completely cut off from being exported to Japan. The enemy country's coal demand reached 45 million tons this year, most of which was supplied by our country. Recently, a "coal shortage" has spread throughout the country, and heavy and light industries, chemical industries, and electrical railways, shipping, and other aspects have been significantly affected. Because Japan's No. 1 solid store, the Tsukiji coalfield, has been almost completely mined. Among other domestic mines, there are only a few dozen coal mountains that produce more than 200,000 tons of coal each year. The mining of coal mines also lacks skilled miners, and the annual coal production is less than 10 million tons, while the required amount reaches 45 million tons. On average, there is a shortage of 3.5 million tons of coal per month. Therefore, since July, all kinds of businesses have been saving and tightening their belts. In other parts of Korea and Taiwan, coal mines are also extremely scarce. As for the Fushun Coal Mine, it produces only 8.3 million tons annually, and less than 2 million tons can be supplied to Japan. Therefore, less than two months after the Lugouqiao Incident, there was a nationwide "coal shortage," and the so-called "fuel famine" became a fatal blow to the production direction.

Due to insufficient supply, Japanese coal prices have been rising daily. It is said that the price was only 30 yuan per ton at the end of June, but suddenly increased by more than 40 yuan per ton last month. Therefore, in the industrial center of Osaka, where consumption is concentrated, industrial capitalists are under the heavy pressure of coal prices and are reducing production capacity. If another three months pass, not only heavy and light industries will be shut down, but also major problems will occur in the fuel for other transportation industries and warships and transport ships.

### British Crew Members on Hong Kong Ship Strike Against Transporting Military Supplies to Japan

Declare Willingness to Go to Jail Rather Than Serve

[Hong Kong] The ship "Severn Ree," belonging to the Severn Shipping Company, is currently chartered by the Japanese company Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and carries coal from Haiphong. It was originally scheduled to sail to Japan yesterday morning, but it has not been able to sail until today because the British crew members on the ship have staged a sit-down strike to protest the transportation of wartime supplies to Japan, which would assist Japan in its war of aggression against China. They declared their willingness to go to jail rather than serve. (Central Reuters dispatch on the 11th)

Commentary

### How to Advance a Favorable International Situation

— Ji

Current international public opinion is extremely sympathetic to us. And the overall international situation is also extremely favorable to us. This is an irrefutable fact. Even the enemy has to admit it and express anxiety. The recent plan of the enemy to send authoritative representatives to lobby in European and American countries is a very obvious example.

The creation of this extremely favorable international situation for us is partly due to the result of our launching a full-scale war of resistance against Japan. As the diplomatic correspondent of the London Times said, "Now that China has risen up and is dealing with Japan, its international position has risen to a height not reached in many years." We have a share of resistance strength. We have a share of resistance determination. The international goodwill towards us will inevitably increase by a share. This is the basic principle of using modern diplomatic relations. There is nothing strange about it. But the other half is caused by the brutal behavior of Japanese imperialism. For example, the shooting of British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen by Japanese aircraft is the best factual propaganda for the arbitrary massacre of Chinese civilians by the Japanese army. Within hours, the power of this propaganda has spread throughout the world. Another example is the bombing of the US flagship "Augusta" by the Japanese army. The Japanese authorities announced on the 25th of last month and the 5th of this month that they would blockade the Chinese coast and arbitrarily intercept merchant ships of third countries. This is the most powerful proof that Japan is obstructing the economic labor of third countries in the Far East. This barbaric action by Japan is in fact a declaration of war against other countries with vested interests in the Pacific.

As a result of the evolution of these two situations, international aid to us has progressed from public opinion to action. American crowds held demonstrations and picketed the Japanese Embassy in the United States and the Consulate General in New York. In addition, 68,000 American sailors and workers advocated that the United States implement an economic blockade against Japan until all Japanese troops withdrew from China. This is one end of the action of assistance. Recently, the American economic and opinion circles have also discussed the issue of a joint Anglo-American economic sanction against Japan. It is believed that the effectiveness of Anglo-American economic sanctions against Japan will be faster than the economic sanctions imposed by the League of Nations against Italy. Once the United Kingdom and the United States jointly impose an economic blockade against Japan, Japan's economy could be fatally hit within four months.

The current international situation is already extremely favorable to us. But the question of how to advance and use this international aid to us is still up to us.

We believe that the proactive work of advancing the current international situation favorable to us should mainly have two ends.

First, we should resolutely show the world our determination to wage a protracted war of resistance. To put it plainly, the enemy has already blockaded our entire coast. Our only hope that "no declaration of war will not lead to a blockade of our coast" has been shattered. And whether third countries implement neutrality or not has ceased to be a problem worthy of our consideration. Therefore, we should immediately recall our ambassadors and consuls stationed in Japan, sever diplomatic relations with Japan, cancel all special rights of Japan in China, suspend the principal and interest payments on all debts to Japan, and confiscate all public and private property of Japan in China, in order to show our determination to resist thoroughly.

Second, we should further cooperate with Soviet Russia in using international diplomatic connections. Although we do not have to rush to make the non-aggression treaty immediately evolve into a mutual assistance treaty militarily, we may take consistent steps with Soviet Russia diplomatically to make the actual effect of this palace of peace of the League of Nations able to be manifested in the Pacific. In a few words, it is to speed up the completion of the mechanism of the Pacific collective security system. To sanction Japan's aggression by collective action. In fact, the possibility of realizing this mechanism is great. The question is whether our use is appropriate or not.

We do not have to be afraid of the establishment of the so-called anti-communist agreement between Japan and Italy, or even the trilateral alliance agreement between Japan, Germany, and Italy. As long as we do not harm the development of German and Italian interests in the Far East, we believe that Germany and Italy may remain neutral.

The use of strategic war is an extremely important part of our war against Japan. The whole country, from top to bottom, should unite and catch up urgently.

### Mediterranean Conference Agrees on Principles of Security Guarantee

Division of Areas and Surveillance Plans Cause Major Political Difficulties

⊙ Nyon, Switzerland: The Mediterranean Conference opened at 4:10 PM today in the town hall of this town. In the conference room, a horseshoe-shaped table was placed, and representatives from nine countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Bulgaria, Egypt, Greece, Romania, Turkey, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia, sat around the table. The Albanian government has not yet submitted a response, so the seat remains vacant. As for Germany and Italy, they have refused to participate, so seats have not been reserved for their representatives. After the opening of the conference, a public meeting was held immediately. First, the mayor of Nyon, Schurrani, delivered a welcome speech. Then, the proposal of British Foreign Secretary Eden was unanimously adopted to elect French Foreign Minister Delbos as chairman. The conference then adjourned at 5:30 PM after successive speeches by Delbos, Soviet Foreign Commissioner Litvinov, and Foreign Secretary Eden (the speeches are in separate telegrams). A technical standing committee was formed immediately to continue discussions until 8:00 PM, and it was decided to continue the meeting at 4:00 PM tomorrow. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 10th)

⊙ Nyon: Responsible persons of the Mediterranean Conference recently declared that the proposals put forward by the United Kingdom and France are based on the idea of ​​delineating safe areas on the Mediterranean Sea, prohibiting submarines from navigating, and having warships of various countries take on the task of surveillance. After discussions among the representatives of various countries, it is said that a compromise has been reached in principle. Although representatives of some countries have requested supplementary explanations on the implementation methods, it is expected that they will be formally passed by 4:00 PM tomorrow, so that they can be implemented before the 20th of this month. According to this proposal, merchant ships of various countries must pass through designated routes in the future, and warships of various countries can protect them and provide assistance in the event of a submarine attack. The issue of preventing attacks by aircraft or warships (excluding submarines) will be discussed after the above proposal is passed. The response is generally to send aircraft carriers to patrol the Mediterranean Sea so that when aircraft attack merchant ships of various countries, the aircraft carriers can send aircraft to pursue them. In addition, regarding the British proposal to divide the Mediterranean into eastern and western parts, it was originally intended that the British and French fleets would be responsible for surveillance of the western part. It is now heard that the United Kingdom and France will invite Italy to cooperate with them. However, if Italy refuses, the United Kingdom and France will still maintain it separately. As for the eastern sea, the fleets of the Soviet Union, Greece, and Turkey will be responsible for surveillance, while Bulgaria and Romania will not participate. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 10th)

⊙ Nyon: According to a Havas reporter, after the opening of the Mediterranean Conference yesterday, the United Kingdom and France proposed that the navies of the countries concerned should monitor the sea lanes in the Mediterranean in different areas to avoid submarine attacks, and that the Soviet navy should also participate in the monitoring. This method has now caused great political difficulties. Observers from some countries attending the meeting immediately objected to the Soviet Union's participation in naval surveillance, believing that since Italy had not yet signed the Montreux Convention on the Turkish Straits last year, if the Soviet Union were to participate in Mediterranean naval surveillance now, Italy would regard it as deliberately making things difficult for the country, and Italy would not be able to join the Montreux Convention. In addition, countries such as Turkey, while welcoming the revival of the Mediterranean mutual assistance system presided over by the United Kingdom and France, are worried that Turkey and other countries will cooperate with the Soviet navy in the eastern Mediterranean, while the British and French fleets will act together in the western region, which seems to be participating in an ideological struggle. There are currently two solutions being considered for this difficulty. One is to stipulate that the Soviet Union's monitoring area should be limited to the Black Sea, or to expand the Mediterranean area and include the Black Sea. The other is to recognize in principle that the Soviet Union has the right to participate in naval surveillance, but to persuade the Soviet Union to give up this surveillance right on the grounds that its naval fleet is not sufficient for deployment. It is heard that the United Kingdom supports the second method, but it is not certain whether the Soviet Union will accept it. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 11th)

⊙ Nyon: British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Foreign Minister Delbos held a meeting this morning, which lasted for a long time, to finalize the British and French Mediterranean naval surveillance plan. Afterwards, the two had consultations with Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov. Also, at noon today, Delbos hosted a banquet for the representatives of the nine countries attending the Mediterranean Conference, and also made preparatory talks. It is heard that the representatives of various countries considered amending the original proposal put forward by the United Kingdom and France as follows: ㊀ If Italy accepts participation in surveillance, the Tyrrhenian Sea (south of Italy) should be entrusted to Italy for surveillance; ㊁ The Soviet Union will specialize in naval surveillance in the Black Sea, while the majority of the Mediterranean Sea will be entrusted to the United Kingdom and France for surveillance. In particular, the dangerous areas of the Spanish coast in the western Mediterranean will be completely under the supervision of the British and French navies. The United Kingdom and France now hope that this matter will be settled tonight and that the entire plan will be passed on the first day of next week. If so, the plan should be implemented immediately, as the British and French governments have prepared to immediately increase their fleets stationed in the Mediterranean. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 11th)

### French, Russian, and British Representatives Deliver Speeches

Upholding International Law, Denouncing Piratical Acts

⊙ Nyon: After being elected as Chairman of the Mediterranean Conference, French Foreign Minister Delbos took the floor and delivered a speech explaining the reasons why the United Kingdom and France convened the conference, stating that piratical acts in the Mediterranean have recently been occurring frequently, and the situation has reached an intolerable level. The United Kingdom and France have therefore convened the Mediterranean Conference to take appropriate measures to end this situation and to implement the principles of international law regarding maritime affairs. It is regrettable that Germany and Italy have refused to participate and have suggested that the Mediterranean issue should be submitted to the London Adjustment Committee for discussion. We believe that the above suggestion cannot be accepted because the nature of the Mediterranean issue is clear and distinct from the issues discussed by the Adjustment Committee, and it must be resolved quickly. The coastal countries of the Mediterranean all have the equal right to freely engage in trade in the Mediterranean, and freedom of traffic in the Mediterranean is of particular importance to some of the countries attending the conference. It is hoped that the conference will quickly conclude an agreement to stop piratical acts and to ease the current tense situation. In recent weeks, the international atmosphere has been quite gloomy, and efforts should be made to clarify it so that various European issues can be dealt with in a good environment.

Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov spoke next, stating that the convening of the Mediterranean Conference at this moment is particularly timely because not only have Soviet ships been harmed by piratical acts, but the Persian Gulf coastal area's communication with foreign countries also relies solely on the Mediterranean as the only channel. The Soviet Union is extremely willing to maintain international order and peace, and is eager to oppose all acts of aggression and violations of international treaties. Now that some countries have refused to participate in the Mediterranean Conference, although those countries all have large merchant fleets, they are not afraid of piratical acts. There are only two reasons for this: ㊀ The piratical acts are directed by those countries; ㊁ Those countries have close relations with the pirates and understand each other. In addition, the Spanish Republican government was not invited to participate in the conference, which is regrettable. We all know the purpose of those piratical acts and which country is responsible for them. However, the name of that country will only be revealed by the victimized countries at the conference. As for the rumor that two Soviet ships were sunk by their own warships, it is extremely absurd and not worth laughing at, because the ships were bombed by aircraft. The Soviet Union is now taking its own measures to protect its ships, but if all countries can take effective collective measures, the Soviet Union is also prepared to participate.

British Foreign Secretary Eden spoke last, saying that the progress of the conference should be made known to Germany and Italy, and it is hoped that those countries will approve of the resolutions that the conference should adopt. Our responsibilities are extremely important and urgent, and they should be fulfilled quickly. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 10th)

### Italy Takes a Reserved Attitude Toward the Nyon Conference

Considers the Russian Representative's Remarks Not Surprising

[Rome] Government officials in the Vatican strictly adhere to a reserved attitude towards the Nyon Conference. However, Italy will not refuse to accept the Mediterranean patrol area plan in principle, but it must be accepted under certain reservations. It is believed that Italy will demand that it be clearly stipulated that no Soviet warship is allowed to appear in the Mediterranean and that Germany be invited to participate in the patrol work, as Germany is one of the original maritime supervisors. After the Italian representative has the opportunity to explain Italy's views and propose amendments, they will advocate that henceforth, please must be issued by the Non-Intervention Committee. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 11th)

[Rome] After Soviet Foreign Commissioner Litvinov delivered a speech at the Mediterranean Conference yesterday, Italian politicians were not surprised. They said that if the Soviet Union uses so-called retaliatory procedures as an excuse to use force, Italy will definitely not regard it as retaliatory procedures, but as aggressive procedures. No action of warships belonging to Italy is sufficient to provoke retaliation from other countries. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 11th)

### British Trade Union Congress Expresses Sympathy for China

Congress Passes a Resolution Condemning Japanese Atrocities

[London] The annual conference of the National Federation of Trade Unions recently passed a resolution after concluding a foreign policy debate, expressing sympathy for the Chinese people, stating that "what China seeks is nothing more than to live in peace with all countries in order to promote its inherent culture. Japan has launched an unprovoked aggression, which is not only a crime against China, but also a violation of international law and a violation of treaty rights. The organized working class of the world now unanimously condemns it. In addition, the Japanese army, navy, and air force arbitrarily kill innocent residents in China. This conference is deeply angered by it and expresses its deep sympathy to the Chinese people who have suffered aggression and whose houses have been destroyed." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 11th)

### British Trade Union Congress Passes Military Expansion Plan

Advocates Strengthening the League of Nations Function

[London] The National Trade Union Congress today passed a national defense policy drafted by the National Labor Committee with 3,544,000 votes against 224,000 votes. This policy allows the nation to obtain full support from labor groups when major international issues arise. The report of the motion mentioned the weakness of the League of Nations, stating that the reason was the lack of British leadership. The solution to this situation is a Labor government, which will soon take power, should have strong enough military equipment to defend itself, and the existing military expansion program should not be suspended before the international situation improves. Sir Walter Citrine, General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, then spoke of the necessity of rebuilding the League of Nations. However, before the League of Nations is rebuilt, the responsibility for maintaining international peace should be borne by a country that is adequately prepared and willing to bear this responsibility. Therefore, if that country wants to fulfill its obligations, it has no choice but to increase its military strength. The British Labour Party hopes that in the near future, it will be able to form a government of this kind. However, if military expansion is necessary, common sense dictates that it need not wait for the establishment of a Labor government. "I certainly have doubts about the intentions of the British government, but I especially distrust the intentions of dictators," he said. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 10th)

### Cai Jinjun Concurrently Serves as Deputy Commander of Shanghai Garrison

Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance in this city in the middle of last month, the government issued an order for martial law to be implemented, and Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, was ordered to concurrently serve as Commander of the Garrison. It is now learned that the Central Government, considering the importance of Shanghai's local area in maintaining public order and the heavy responsibilities involved, yesterday appointed Cai Jinjun, Director of the Police Bureau, to concurrently serve as Deputy Commander of the Shanghai Garrison to assist him. It is reported that Cai has already received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek informing him to comply and immediately go to his post.

### Director Li Announces Cholera Discovered in This City

Refutes Enemy's Slander; Urges Citizens' Attention

The newspaper reported on the 11th of this month that some enemy soldiers were suffering from cholera. Their spokesman even made slanderous accusations to Western reporters, falsely claiming that it was caused by our army using germ bombs. This reporter specially visited Director Li of the Municipal Health Bureau to inquire about everything. According to Director Li's personal statement, since the Japanese army invaded, many people in Shanghai and nearby areas have been displaced, gathering together and living in simple conditions, making them most susceptible to infectious gastrointestinal diseases. The bureau had already found more than a dozen people suffering from cholera among the refugees more than ten days ago. To date, the number of cholera patients has increased to more than 100. It has also joined forces with the Seaport Quarantine Office to expand prevention work. A telegram was also received from Director Gan of the Nanjing Health Office, stating that 19 refugees passing through Nanjing from Shanghai had been found to have cholera. This is sufficient proof that the poor wartime environment is enough to cause epidemics. The enemy's false claim that our army used germ bombs is simply unfounded. It is hoped that the people will pay special attention to their diet and daily life, and never easily ingest anything that is not boiled water and cooked food, and receive free injections of cholera and typhoid vaccine to prevent infection.

### Italy Sends Ship "Endeavour" to Transport Refugees

Shanghai Still Has 400,000 People in Need of Transportation to Ningbo, Taizhou, and Other Ports

Since the outbreak of war in Shanghai, the total number of refugees from Ningbo, Taizhou, Huangyan, and surrounding areas has been more than 500,000. In the past half month, the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association has managed to send about 100,000 people to Ningbo Port. At least 400,000 people remain in the war zone and are in dire need of relief and transportation. The Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association originally chartered four foreign ships and sent two ships out every day to transport these refugees out of the country. However, the Japanese side, regardless of their words and credibility, broke international conventions and forcibly searched the British and Italian ships of the first countries, arousing the resistance of various countries. The Italian Consul first raised a serious protest because of the search of the Italian ship "Longshan," and engaged in tough negotiations with the Japanese Navy. The Japanese side has already replied. Now, the Italian shipping company has decided to dispatch two Italian ships "Endeavour" to run exclusively on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, transporting refugees awaiting transportation away from Shanghai, in order to rescue a large number of refugees. The Italian flag is specially painted on both sides and on top of the ship. The ship can set sail in the next day or two.

All parking in Shanghai is temporarily at the Jinliyuan Wharf.

### Declaration of the Ryukyu Revolutionary Party

Ever since the corruption of the Qing Dynasty and the Sino-Japanese War, our Ryukyu people have been plunged into a state of misery for forty years. All those with lofty ideals have wanted to expel those barbarians and coexist with the motherland. However, repeated uprisings have only increased the vigilance of the Japanese bandits and deepened our suffering. But all of this is not enough to extinguish our original intention to restore the country, but rather strengthens it. We know that we cannot live unless we completely destroy the Japanese bandits. Now that the motherland has raised the sacred banner of the War of Resistance against Japan, it is also a good opportunity for the Ryukyu people to break away from the tyrannical Japanese. We hereby respectfully inform the people of China with the utmost sincerity, hoping that they will not abandon the Ryukyu people who have been ostracized for decades. At the same time, we also respectfully inform the people of Korea and Taiwan, we are fellow sufferers. This time, we should be truly awakened, join hands with the motherland, and jointly obtain the path to light and freedom. Do not covet personal peace and tranquility and leave a legacy of disaster for future generations. Ai Fenglu, Ryukyu Revolutionary Association.

### Various Parties Enthusiastically Subscribe to National Salvation Bonds

### Restrictions on Wearing Scout Uniforms During Wartime

Must Participate in Wartime Work

After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Shanghai Boy Scout Council immediately established the Boy Scout Wartime Service Corps to undertake various wartime service work. The number of people who registered to participate reached more than 2,000. However, according to regulations, scout uniforms can be used as school uniforms, so there are not a few students in this city who wear scout uniforms. During this period, swaggering through the streets can easily cause misunderstandings in various circles. In order to strictly restrict this, in addition to ordering the scouts participating in the wartime service corps to wear a symbol, those who do not participate in the wartime service corps, regardless of whether they were originally scouts or not, are not allowed to wear scout uniforms during this wartime period for identification purposes. At the same time, it has also sent a letter to the Social Bureau, ordering various primary and secondary schools in this city to instruct students to be informed.

Red Cross Society

In light of the increasingly tense situation in South China, the General Headquarters of the Chinese Red Cross Society, in addition to urgently telegraphing its branches in Guangzhou, Shantou, Xinhui, Fuzhou, and other locations to intensify rescue efforts in accordance with Order No. 19 and to report the local situation and handling progress at any time, has also instructed the Guangdong Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs to convene relevant groups to discuss implementation methods. The Guangdong Provincial Rescue Committee was immediately established, with officials appointed and offices set up within the Guangzhou Red Cross Branch, commencing operations. Xie Yingbo of the branch has been elected as the Deputy Director.

Mr. Hu Wenhu

Overseas Chinese businessman Mr. Hu Wenhu from Singapore, driven by fervent patriotic sentiments, has been donating funds and medicines and subscribing to national salvation bonds, as previously reported. It is now learned that Mr. Hu, in response to the needs of the times, had long ago trained a large number of rescue personnel in Hong Kong in preparation for wartime use. Recently, recognizing that the full-scale war of resistance against Japan has already begun, he convened a meeting of various sectors at the Hotel des Lignes in Hong Kong on the 26th of last month and decided to mobilize personnel to head north for rescue work in the shortest possible time. The team leader is Mr. Morris, the captain of the Hong Kong St. John Ambulance Brigade. The clothing expenses for all the rescue workers, as well as the medical supplies for rescue, are all borne by Mr. Hu personally. It is reported that the purpose of this trip is to extend work and belongs to the nature of international rescue, so there are no regional boundaries for the rescued, and they are treated equally. The team will arrive soon.

Fellow Sichuanese

The Wartime Service Corps of the Sichuan Fellow Association's Anti-Enemy Support Association is extremely active in supporting the war of resistance. This time, the organization of a rescue team to depart for the front to rescue wounded soldiers is extremely effortful. It is reported that from September 1st to 7th, the team rescued a total of four wounded soldiers, all of whom were sent to various hospitals for treatment. It is also reported that they encountered danger several times during their work, and their ambulance was also damaged by artillery fire.

The monastic rescue team directly under the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association's War Zone Refugee Relief Committee has been venturing to the forefront in recent days, engaging in rescue work selflessly, and has received widespread praise. It is now learned that the team has rescued more than eighty wounded officers and soldiers from the front line and has sent them to the rescue hospital (i.e., the wounded soldiers' hospital) run by the association at No. 6 Yuyuan Road for proper treatment.

Scout Efforts

Ni Jialing, the leader of the Wartime Service Corps of the Shanghai Boy Scouts, along with staff members Shao Gu and Chen Shaohui, has gone to the front line and other places to express the most comforting intentions to the Boy Scouts serving on the front lines.

### Fierce Battle for Two Days and Nights in Yangxing; Enemy Forces Heavily Struck by Our Side

Our Forces Hold an Extremely Advantageous Position, and Stubborn Enemies Can Be Defeated Sooner or Later; We Still Firmly Defend the Qiujiang Wharf Military Supply Route; Enemy Counterattacks in Luodian and Yuepu All Fail

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Since yesterday and the day before, enemy forces have invaded Yangxing from Baoyang Road, with exceptionally fierce artillery fire and multiple aircraft assisting in the battle, attempting to open a line to Luodian. After our army fiercely resisted and fought bravely, the enemy forces, led by tanks advancing east from Dinggong Temple and Wooden Bridge House, broke through our army's defense line in Yangxing Town last night under the cover of aircraft and artillery fire. Our elite troops in the rear immediately moved to the front line for a fierce counterattack. From night to morning, the artillery fire was incessant. It was the most intense battle in the month since the enemy's invasion of Shanghai. The enemy forces had not yet gained a firm foothold when they were heavily struck by our army, suffering heavy casualties. As of the time of this reporter's writing, our army held an extremely advantageous position and advanced to the Yujiabang area east of the town. Moreover, another enemy force invaded Yuepu, but our army was prepared and the enemy's plot failed. However, between Yuepu and Yangxing, a large number of enemy planes carried out heavy bombing, dropping incendiary bombs everywhere. The villages east of Yuzhai Bang and Yangxing Town were set on fire and turned into scorched earth.

### Fierce Fighting in Yangxing All Night

Our Forces Fight Bravely to be First with Very Advantageous Situation; Enemy Forces' Corpses Lay Pillowed on Each Other, and Losses Are Extremely Heavy

Since the enemy forces suffered a major defeat after invading from the Qiujiang Wharf with their elite troops and being fiercely struck by our forces, and at the same time, they lost their troops and generals at various points along the line, this caused great anxiety on the enemy's side. Therefore, they urgently changed their strategy, gathering all their existing forces to attack a certain area in an attempt to develop. The enemy's urgent attack on Yangxing and Yuepu in the past two days was the enemy's premeditation. Our army had already anticipated this move and launched a fierce attack when they saw the invasion. The enemy forces always relied on the cover of their artillery fire, tanks, and other vehicles to continuously attack from the northeast outside Yangxing Town, while our front-line defenders calmly responded and were never allowed to succeed. Seeing that the middle road was difficult to attack, the enemy focused on the left and right wings, copying Yangxing. After our army's bloody battle for two days and nights, a certain point in the northeast (i.e., between Yangxing and Baoshan) near Baoyang Road was slightly broken through by the enemy forces. At that time, our reinforcements immediately arrived, responded, and urgently counterattacked the enemy's陣. Seeing that our reinforcements were unstoppable and the front line was fundamentally shaken, the enemy forces also urgently increased reinforcements and stubbornly resisted. Thus, the two sides engaged in a bloody battle between Baoyang Road. The artillery fire of both sides did not stop all night. Although our army was in the midst of artillery fire, none of them fought bravely to be first, and their blood and flesh pressed forward. Soon the enemy's momentum gradually declined, and we gained an absolute advantage. The fierce battle continues to this day. Our army's situation is superior, the enemy's corpses are piled up, and the losses are extremely heavy. Judging from their original intentions, it seems that they wanted to seize Yangxing and then approach Jiangwan, but now it has become a pipe dream.

### Enemy Counterattacks Again at Qiujiang Wharf

Coming to Harass with a Small Number of Troops; Enemy Forces Retreat After Our Army Bravely Sweeps

After the enemy forces that landed at Qiujiang Wharf were repelled by our forces, the remaining defeated enemies retreated to a small area east of the Military Supply Road, stubbornly resisting. Yesterday afternoon, under the cover of enemy naval artillery fire, a small number of troops harassed our position. After our army bravely swept with machine guns, the enemy was defeated and retreated.

The military authority received a confirmed report from the front this morning that at around 6:00 PM yesterday, after the enemy forces were reinforced at Qiujiang Wharf, they immediately launched a fierce attack on our position west of the Military Supply Road. After encountering them, a fierce battle broke out. At around 11:00 PM that night, the enemy finally retreated. Subsequently, although enemy ships occasionally fired at our side, the infantry never dared to move. Therefore, as of this afternoon, the enemy forces are still firmly defending along the Military Supply Road line. The enemy forces landed at Qiujiang Wharf on the 6th and attacked our city center. As a result of days of fierce fighting, the enemy forces suffered a disastrous defeat and heavy casualties. On the 10th, they retreated into Qiujiang Wharf and relied on solid buildings to stubbornly resist. The remaining enemies, with the help of reinforcements, rushed into the wharf several times in an attempt to break through our Military Supply Road defense line. They were met with a brave counterattack by our forces and suffered repeated heavy blows. As of this morning, the enemy forces are still confined within Qiujiang Wharf, surrounded by our three-sided siege.

### Enemy Attacks Yuepu with Main Force

We Still Defend the Original Line of Defense

Central News Agency reports that last night, enemy forces attacked us on the Yuepu front with their main force. The fighting was fierce. Our army, in addition to sweeping with dense machine guns, also bombarded the enemy's position with mortars. The fierce battle lasted all night. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated. As of this morning (12th), our army is still defending the original line of defense, waiting for an opportunity to attack.

### Enemy Forces Still Surrounded in Luodian

Enemy Forces Tried to Break Out Several Times Last Night; Fierce Fighting Continues Until This Morning, and the Front Line Remains Unchanged

Confirmed news is that the enemy forces in the Luodian area are still surrounded by our army on three sides. Starting yesterday evening, the enemy forces tried to break out several times, but they were suppressed by our army's fierce firepower. The fighting was very intense at the time, and both sides suffered casualties. As of this morning, the front line has not changed.

The military authority received a report from the front that the enemy forces in the Caowangmiao area northwest of Luodian attacked our Shixianggong Temple position last night. At the same time, enemy ships on the Shidongkou sea also frequently fired in support. Our army attacked from three sides at the same time. The bloody battle continues to this morning and is still ongoing there.

### We Killed Many Enemies at Hei Qiaozhai

More Than Forty Rifles Were Captured on the Spot

The enemy forces at Zhanghuabang and Yunzaobang were repelled by our forces to the coastal area east of Nansitang. Our army firmly defended the west bank. At dawn yesterday, enemy naval artillery fire densely fired, covering its army's breakthrough of our Shenjiazhai and Hei Qiaozhai positions. Our army calmly responded and immediately jumped out of the trenches to launch a brave assault when the enemy approached. At around 6:00 PM, our army advanced to Hei Qiaozhai. In this battle, more than fifty enemies were killed, and more than forty rifles were captured.

### No Changes to Zhabei Position

Enemy Attacked Last Night and Was Repelled

Central News Agency reports that at midnight yesterday, enemy forces attacked our position in the direction of the Patriotic Girls' School again. Our army calmly responded and immediately swept with extremely machine guns and attacked the enemy with hand grenades when the enemy approached. The enemy forces suffered heavy losses and retreated. At the same time, there have been small contacts in various positions in Zhabei from last night (11th) to this morning. The positions of both sides have not changed so far.

### Enemy Planes Bombed Various Places Again

At 2:55 AM this morning, enemy planes suddenly flew to Pudong for reconnaissance, hovering for four or five minutes without dropping bombs. They only released a flare opposite the Jianghai Customs Clock Tower, which was very bright. Then they flew away. At that time, the reporter looked up to the north, and the fire of North Sichuan Road also went from large to small, and it was completely extinguished at 3:15.

At around 9:00 AM today, two enemy planes hovered in the sky over Nanshi Dananmen, Lujiabang, and Gaochangmiao. Then they swept down with machine guns for about half an hour before stopping. A dozen citizens on the road were injured. They also continuously shot at the people crossing the river by ferry along the river in Pudong. The enemy's cruel behavior can be seen.

### One Enemy Plane Was Damaged Last Night

Ta Kung Pao reports confirmed information that at around 10:30 last night, when our air force came to Shanghai to bomb enemy ships, it encountered two enemy planes in the airspace over the Huangpu River. A certain foreigner witnessed an enemy plane being hit in the tail by our plane on the Bund of Beijing Road and suddenly descending. The front propeller made a loud noise and went in the direction of Yangshupu. Another enemy plane was also extremely panicked, and it frantically fired machine guns into the air many times and escaped. Our plane then calmly flew back to its defensive area.

### Enemy Seizes Our Merchant Ship and Converts It into a Warship

This Kind of Action Is No Different from Banditry

In recent days, our air force has launched night raids, dropping bombs and bombing enemy ships on the Huangpu River, which has made them very uneasy. It is now known that the enemy naval authorities have seized our country's merchant ship Changde (originally moored at the Mitsui Wharf to unload coal, but the cargo was not out of the cabin, and the war started, so the ship was seized by the enemy navy until now), and the hull has been converted into a warship. Anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns have been erected on the bridge, cannons have been installed at the bow and stern, and machine guns have been placed on the deck. The six sailors who remained on the ship to keep the fire going have been driven ashore to Shanghai. Now the ship has been opened by the enemy from yesterday, and it has been opening fire at Qiujiang Wharf, Yangshupu, and other places during the day to bombard our positions. At night, it is ordered to drive in to cover the enemy flagship Izumo and hope to disrupt the bombing of our air force. The Changde wheel has a displacement of 3,500 tons, a value of 200,000 yuan, and 1,700 tons of coal in the ship have also been taken and used by the enemy.

Generously Donates One Thousand Yuan and Does Not Accept Public Bonds; Awarded a Plaque to Show Encouragement

An old woman, Zheng Liang, in Foshan, Guangdong, is sixty-eight years old. Seeing that the violent Japanese invaded and were heavily struck by the national army everywhere, she was very excited.

### The Enemy's Attack on the Capital Suffered a Miserable Defeat

[Nanjing] August 26 On the night when the enemy planes attacked our capital, our planes tracked them down and shot down two type 56 land-based attack aircraft within the territory of Chang, destroying the planes and killing the people. The diary of Captain Ōni Miichiro of the plane was found, which recorded in detail the miserable situation of the first attack on our capital on August 15, when we were defeated. The translation is as follows: "The 0900 from the Muki 空队 (Kokutai) on August 15 departed from 大空(Ohmura) with 20 aircraft to attack Nanjing. Aircraft No. 1 of the 1st Squadron crashed, and 1st Class Airman Ota died in battle. The aircraft was hit 42 times. The 2nd Squadron turned into the center of the typhoon, aircraft No. 2 and No. 4 of the 3rd Squadron caught fire and crashed to the ground, and aircraft No. 4 of the 4th Squadron was missing. Sergeant Major Watanabe of Aircraft No. 1 died in the reconnaissance seat. Aircraft No. 2 of the 5th Squadron caught fire and crashed to the ground, and No. 3 was killed in 片船 (katabune). The initial encounter was so unfortunate that it would be even more painful to return to Chiba in the end. I had the determination to jump down and die together, but my body is no longer my own, and I can only hold the machine gun with both hands and pray silently. After six hours of sailing, 20 people were damaged that day: Airman Taisan of the 1st Squadron, 2nd Class Airman Dangyue of the 2nd Squadron, 1st Class Air Ito空曹(Kuso), Sergeant Major Konno, Airman Nakanishi, 全森 (Zenmori)由中(Yuchu) 2nd Class Seizo Suto, Sergeant Major 1st Class Peak 一空(Ikku), Airman Sakurai of 2nd Class Eri: 1st Class Sergeant Major Tanaka, Hoshino of 1st Class (Star Field) 2nd Class Seizo of the 4th Squadron, Sergeant Major Watanabe, Daita Ikkusao, Nanba Ikkusao, Tomikoshi Ikkubado Yu Ichito (Yuichito) Hitsuze, Village Ikkusao, Yamaishi 1st Class Seizo Saito 1st Class Dong, Ogawa Ikkusao, Obayashi Ikkusao, Fujinaga and Kori 空曹(Kuso), Chiba Ikkosao仲谷(Nakaya) 2nd Class 柯(Ka). 空隊(Kutai) means Mukuyjin Naval Air Corps, and 大空(Daiku) means Omura Air Base.

### Trivial Comments

— Xiang

Japanese Prime Minister Konoe recently met with Japanese journalists. The reporters raised several points and asked for his opinion, such as how to handle the current situation in the future, how to follow the war cabinet's policy, and how to determine the budget policy for next year, etc. These questions are the most urgent and should be known to the Japanese people. However, Konoe summarized one answer: war. He said that there is no question to consider other than war. This is too reckless and too disregardful of everything. Individuals need to plan and consider steps when handling one thing. How can a country as big as a war alone solve everything? I don't think that's possible. Japan sees our country as a fish in a urn and a thing in a bag. Unexpectedly, this time it encountered our country's brave resistance and sustained resistance, which is like swallowing a bomb. It is appropriate that they are in a hurry and unable to get rid of it.

### A Militarist Country Is Unable to Cope

The Army School Changes the Curriculum; The Air Force's Enhancement Is Also in Progress

Central News Agency reports that Japanese warlords, in an attempt to realize their dream of conquering China and implementing their continental policy, do not hesitate to engage in military expansion and invade with the whole country. The country has fallen into a state of wartime terror. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, especially after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, more than 200,000 troops have been mobilized, but they have been suddenly countered by our strong resistance, and they have suffered heavy losses. They have been constantly asking for assistance. The Army Ministry authorities have a feeling of being unable to cope and have decided to change the curriculum of the Army School, which has been announced on the 2nd of this month with Imperial Edict No. 470. The revision of the study period of various schools has been shortened from seven years and eight months to six years and one month to accelerate the training of officers and soldiers during wartime. It is said that this special case was implemented during the Russo-Japanese War and is now being implemented again, which shows the importance of this war. The enhancement of the Japanese Air Force is also in progress. It is for the transfer of specially trained officers and soldiers in various subjects and expands the scope of the adoption of special volunteer officers and soldiers. As for the third increase in the temporary military expenditure for China recently passed by the Japanese Special Parliament, it is 2.2 billion yuan, of which the Army Ministry is 1.422 billion yuan, and the Navy Ministry is 349 million yuan, and the remaining 250 million yuan is for reserve funds.

### Heartrending Memories (1)

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Shu Di

From the fall of Peiping (Beijing) and Tientsin (Tianjin) until the time I, as a reporter, escaped to Nanking (Nanjing), there was approximately one month. What I saw, what I thought, what I heard, and even the various things I personally experienced, every time I recall them, every time I reflect on them, various indescribable feelings arise in my heart. — I don't know if it's sadness, I don't know if it's sorrow, I don't know if it's desolation, I don't know if it's tragic and heroic... In short, it's definitely not a simple feeling. However, within these various memories and emotions, I clearly saw traces of blood and shadows of tears. Now, I am sitting in a tall building in the Shanghai International Settlement. Three minutes ago, right on the main street in front of this room, a stray bullet suddenly flew down. The bustling crowd immediately scattered in panic, leaving only a desolate and empty street. Overhead, there were stray bullets of unknown origin, from time to time, drawing a long whistle in the air. In the distance, constantly, there was a "boom" sound, then another "boom" sound, shaking the earth. — The duller ones were probably bombs, and those that echoed far and near were probably heavy artillery.

In such a mood, in such an environment, it is indeed impossible to write something systematic. But in order for readers to know something about the situation in Peiping and Tientsin, I can only endure the shaking of bloodstains and tearful shadows, indifferently set aside the combined奏 sound of artillery and aircraft engines beside my ears, and fragmentarily write down my disorganized memories and thoughts.

㊀ What is the significance of the fall of Peiping and Tientsin?

July 29, 1937, of the Gregorian calendar, which is also July 29, 1937, of the Republic of China. On this day, a very significant change occurred in the world, namely: —

The famous city of the Republic of China, Peiping, actually fell into the bloody clutches of Japanese imperialists!

Immediately afterwards, Tientsin, located 140 miles south of Peiping, suffered the same fate. Thus, the enemy's forces, in the south, advanced along the Peiping-Hankow and Tientsin-Pukou railways, one branch progressing to Changxindian and Liangxiang, and the other branch progressing to Machang and Duliu. In the north, they advanced along the Peiping-Suiyuan railway, all the way to Juyongguan and Nankou. Behind this large area occupied by the enemy by force, there were two advancing channels: one was the Peiping-Liaoning Railway, which transported land and air forces from outside the pass, and the other was the Dagu Port, which transported naval and air forces from the sea. At this point, the enemy's strategic situation was very clear: she was attempting to use Peiping and Tientsin as a base, with the puppet "Manchukuo" and the Bohai Sea as the rear, to launch a brutal war of aggression against our entire country and nation! In this way, facing her tyrannical strategy, our attitude could only fall into the fate of choosing one of two paths: resisting to the end or surrendering completely, with absolutely no possibility of taking a third path. — What "enduring humiliation for the sake of complete preservation," "temporary compromise," etc., had become outdated nonsense at this point.

Moreover, Peiping is our capital for hundreds of years, one of our top "cultural cities," the military center and transportation hub of North China, Tientsin is the economic center of North China, and Dagu Port is the first port in North China. Without Peiping and Tientsin, there is no North China; and if China loses North China, the possibility of independence in terms of resources will be fundamentally shaken. China cannot establish a nation without North China; North China cannot be preserved without Peiping and Tientsin. This is a very obvious fact. Apart from the above-mentioned strategic relationship, just from this point alone, if China were to passively exist while tolerating the enemy's occupation of Peiping and Tientsin (in fact, no matter from which aspect, this assumption is impossible), then it would be equivalent to losing half of itself.

We also remember that not long after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, at the Lushan National Scholars and Celebrities Conference, the highest authorities of our government repeatedly declared their determination to defend territorial sovereignty. And Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's speech on July 17 particularly clearly indicated that if the enemy invaded Peiping, the Chinese nation would reach the final moment of sacrifice. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's speech was not transmitted to Peiping by the Central News Agency's telegraph on the 19th until July 20, giving the Hebei-Chahar authorities, who were then conducting appeasement negotiations with the Japanese side, a head-on blow. This, for some of the authorities in Hebei and Chahar, may be said to have been an opportunity to wake up suddenly, abruptly understanding the true intentions of the government; however, for the enemy, it was originally an expected event. Her steps were still in accordance with the original plan, without a single error; on the one hand, superficially perfunctorily dealing with negotiations, as a delaying tactic, and on the other hand, rapidly increasing troops, preparing for military occupation. If it is said that the Japanese side did not understand the determination of our government authorities, and only hoped to advance the attack on Peiping and Tientsin, as a threat, in order to achieve certain demands, then we would be underestimating the enemy too much; precisely because she knew that our government was determined, she had no choice but to strike first, occupy Peiping and Tientsin, and blatantly challenge us. Therefore, this time, the enemy is deliberately driving them to a dead end! The Chinese nation is promising, and she certainly will not tolerate the enemy's piecemeal torture, so the only inevitable result is to rise up and resist!

At the same time, we must know that the peace of the modern world is indivisible. A comprehensive and protracted war of resistance between China and Japan will inevitably lead to the outbreak of a world war; and this next world war will be a large-scale destruction of human civilization. These have long become common sense for a group of people, and are by no means the unique view of a few knowledgeable people, or the杞人憂天 worries of a few people. These simple truths, the enemy side, are certainly clear about. What is the reason for clearly understanding and insisting on doing this? In a word; the first reason is to break through her own isolation in international relations and strengthen the unity of the fascist state group; the second reason is to prolong the fate of capitalism, especially to want to make a few dying capitalist countries re-expand from the great chaos of the world.

To sum up, in making the determination to occupy Peiping and Tientsin, we must thoroughly recognize the enemy's true intentions this time: first, rather than saying that it is to avoid causing a comprehensive and protracted war of resistance between China and Japan, it is precisely pushing us to the road of comprehensive and protracted war of resistance; second, rather than saying that it is worried about causing the outbreak of a world war, it is precisely trying to promote it; third, rather than saying that it does not understand the fact that human civilization will be largely destroyed because of it, it is rather stubbornly saying that it is aware of making it happen, so that a few capitalist countries can take risks and succeed. Furthermore, if the Japanese side did not have these consistent understandings and resolutions, then, in the region of Peiping and Tientsin, where international relations are so complex and China attaches great importance to, she would never have rashly and stubbornly occupied it.

An American newspaper used the metaphor of "playing with fire" to explain the significance of Japan's atrocities in China to the overall situation of the world; in my opinion, "setting fire" is more accurate.

The flames of a full-scale war of resistance between China and Japan have been lit; the signal for a world war has risen; the death knell for human civilization is ringing. — This is the entire significance of the fall of Peiping and Tientsin by the Japanese imperialists this time.

### In Memory of Martyr Yan Haiwen's Sacrifice

— Jinjiang

The sound of drums and horns stirred on the sea,
The dwarf bandits invaded, boasting their arrogance,
Do you not see that the battle has only lasted a week or so,
Three thousand bones lie interred, pillowed together.
The land battle, hand-to-hand combat, the enemy was crushed,
The air force roared, the clouds changed color.
In the year of the founding, the twenty-sixth, August seventeenth,
Martyr Yan Haiwen, ordered to punish the obstinate.
One team, three aircraft soared,
Back and forth, bombs were frequently hurled at enemy ships,
Entering and exiting the flames of war, forgetting life and death,
The sound of cannons rumbled, the smoke was dense,
Only seeking to complete the mission,
Exhibiting all of his flying skills.
Suddenly, the enemy's bullet struck the fuselage,
The fuselage tilted, the wings were damaged,
Quickly deployed the parachute,
Swinging back to our homeland.
How could he know he would eventually be surrounded,
Instantly the dwarf bandits swarmed.
The martyr calmly raised his gun,
Gunfire rang out, a barrage of bullets,
Countless stubborn enemies fell in response,
Looking around, corpses were everywhere in pools of blood.
The last bullet,
Aimed precisely at the temple,
A loud bang, both heroic and tragic.
The dwarf bandits all clicked their tongues at it,
A good man of China,
Poured out a cavity full of hot blood.
Facing disaster, only death,
How could he allow himself to be desecrated by the dwarf bandits?
Magnificent, Yan Haiwen,
The Yellow Emperor has descendants.
Your great name will flow like rivers for ten thousand years,
Your righteousness will forever exist with heaven and earth.
