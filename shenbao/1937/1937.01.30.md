Tokyo Correspondence

### Leaping Japan

— Nagumo

"If a war breaks out, how will the food problem be solved?"

This question was posed by the Tokyo Yomiuri on January 8th, specifically to Japanese women. The reason for raising this question is:

The European storms, the turmoil in China, may cause war at any moment. Japan is a country notoriously lacking in food, so it is necessary to prepare in advance. If a war breaks out, the rural youths who produce food will inevitably be sent to the front lines, and all food industries will be transformed into military industries. Even if the country has some food reserves, they must be used to supply the soldiers at the front. Therefore, Japanese women should use this time to plan ahead, diligently study methods of storing and conserving food at home, to avoid excessive panic in the future.

In addition, he argued that when war breaks out, the government should establish a "Food Ministry." The main task of the "Food Ministry" would be, first, to transport the abundant food from Manchuria to Japan for the Japanese to consume. At the same time, it would implement consumption conservation, production allocation, control, and durable storage methods to prevent food panic after the war is prolonged.

After reading such a proposal, one cannot help but be reminded of "Leaping Japan."

"Leaping Japan"! Those five words are seen too often by people living in Japan. "Leaping" is originally a good word, but seeing it too much can cause special feelings and mental trembling.

Also this year (around January 3rd), a so-called "poet" named Hakushū Kitahara published a book of national songs entitled "Songs of Leaping Japan." It contains a collection of 145 songs. Newspaper advertisements consider this to be "the culmination of Japanese songs, a great driving force to inspire the wind and clouds and promote national fortune."

Yes, "Inspire the wind and clouds"! "Leaping Japan" currently needs to "inspire the wind and clouds." If the wind is calm and the clouds are still, from where can Japan leap? Therefore, in this collection of songs claimed to be collected by a poet, "Develop Manchuria, "Glorious Korea," "Comfort the Kwantung Army," "Greater East Asia Alliance Song"...etc., are all collected inside, and are considered important songs for the promotion of Japan.

Songs are originally reflections of the people. But if ordinary people are considerate of the government's painstaking efforts and use the power of politics to create songs, that is a different story.

That's right, Japan is "leaping." Look, public agencies, entertainment venues, where isn't "Leaping Japan" written? This is Japan's self-praise in recent years, and it seems to be able to boast. I remember when I first arrived in Japan, there was a shortage of leather goods, and it cost a lot of money to buy a coat collar. But now? Because of the so-called "Manchukuo," industrial development, and trade promotion, there are already many leather goods in Tokyo's department stores. Modern Japanese women, just by looking at the leather goods they wear, can also taste the meaning of "Leaping Japan," right?

Many things that did not exist before are now available, and this "leap" is enough to boast about. However, in order to maintain this "leap" and strengthen this "leap," the budget must leap, taxes must leap, "labor intensification" must leap, the import of military raw materials must leap, and social prices must also leap.

Increasing the burden on the general public has become unavoidable in today's "Leaping Japan." The decisive factor for the victory or defeat of the "leap" is mainly military strength. If military strength is inferior to others, then the so-called "leap" is probably just a flash in the pan. Since 1937, both the Washington Treaty and the London Treaty have expired, and the naval competition among the great powers has entered an era without constraints. Japan's ideal enemy for its navy is the United States. The United States has fifteen battleships, Japan only nine. The United States has fifteen class A cruisers, Japan only twelve. The United States has two hundred and twenty-one destroyers, Japan only ninety-six. The United States has eighty-five submarines, Japan only fifty-seven. Japan can only compete with the United States with aircraft carriers and Class B cruisers. But relying only on the strength of these two types of warships is too poor, so the Japanese naval authorities cannot but advocate "leaping ship construction," right? But the problem is that the United States is also "leaping," so the future of this "leap" is endless.

Speaking of the air force and the army, Japan's ideal enemy, needless to say, everyone knows is the Soviet Union. Now, let's compare the military preparations of Japan and the Soviet Union.

First, let's talk about the army: the Soviet Union has 1.6 million soldiers, Japan only 250,000. The Soviet Union has 4,000 tanks, Japan only 150. The Soviet Union has 1,000 armored vehicles, Japan only 80. The Soviet Union has 1,500 anti-aircraft guns, Japan only 80.

Next, let's talk about the air force: the Soviet Union has 5,000 military aircraft, Japan only 1,800. The Soviet Union has 1,000 civilian aircraft, Japan only 152. As for the navy, the Soviet Union's current naval power is also more than half the strength of the Japanese navy (the above comparison of various military preparations is based on the "Hinode" New Year issue). Moreover, the Soviet Union's budget for this year has also increased by more than two-tenths compared to last year's defense spending, which shows that "Leaping Japan" still needs to "leap" greatly.

○○○

Perhaps it is also because of the leap that Japan has added many activities and also added more contradictions. The number of unemployed people has not decreased compared to before, and the number of people enjoying themselves has shown a special phenomenon this year. The number of people who went to Meiji Shrine (in Tokyo) on New Year's Day increased by 130,000 compared to last year (820,000 last year, 950,000 this year). However, the number of New Year's Day travelers at Tokyo Station, which is the main gateway of Tokyo, decreased by about 10,000 compared to last year. However, Tokyo Station's fare revenue did not suffer any losses as a result. The reason is: there are especially many luxury travelers going to Ise, Atami, Izu, and Hakone and other famous places this year. Japanese newspapers say: "This is good evidence of the economic situation this year" (Tokyo Asahi - January 3). In fact, it would be more appropriate to say that it is a crippled economic situation of the military industry. The public's pockets are emptier than last year. Many people were able to go to nearby places through Tokyo Station last year, but this year they can only wander around Tokyo. On the other hand, a small number of people who have benefited from the military industry are even more generous than last year, running to Atami, running to Hakone, and running to farther places to savor their own economic situation.

This month's 21st is the date of the opening of the 70th Japanese Parliament. In the annual parliament, political parties are bound to raise many questions, question the government, and make things difficult for the government, in order to enhance their own prestige. This is originally a formality and has become a custom. But this time's parliament can not help but give people a sense of "the storm is coming, the wind is filling the building." The conflict between the military and the political parties, the contradiction between the political parties and the government, the degree of its intensification, is indeed more "leaping" than before.

In the upcoming parliament, the main issues that political parties are preparing to attack the government are: first, the diplomatic issue, second, the tax increase issue, and third, the nationalization of electricity issue. Regarding the diplomatic issue, the government also seems to admit that it has failed considerably and is currently requesting self-defense countermeasures in an attempt to ease the political parties' fierce attacks. As for the tax increase issue and the nationalization of electricity issue? Because it represents the intention of the military to establish a "quasi-wartime economic system," the military has already expressed its opinion and is determined to support the government. If the political parties want to actively oppose it, even if the parliament is dissolved, they will not hesitate to do so (Tokyo Yomiuri - January 6). In this way, the political parties cannot help but be alarmed. Attacking the government is originally a custom, but offending the military, one cannot but be concerned.

○○○

In reality, only the Japanese military can most straightforwardly recognize the truth about "Leaping Japan." The vision of bureaucratic political parties is not good enough. An imperialist country, if it wants to "leap," it can only develop outward. If it cannot develop outward, then what is it "leaping" for? The "September 18th" Incident, seizing Manchuria overnight, was indeed a great leap for Japan. The name "Leaping Japan" was established from that time.

After "September 18th," with a light foot, it leaped into the Great Wall again. "Leaping!" "Leaping!" Although the "leap" was successful, the future of the leap is also full of difficulties. The military preparations are so far behind those of other powerful countries, what kind of "crocodile tears" are you bourgeois political parties still crying? Without increasing taxes, how can the budget be increased, and without increasing the budget, how can military preparations be strengthened? Needless to say, we still want to "leap" again. Even just to maintain this victory that has already been obtained, it is necessary to actively expand military preparations and leap even more.

"Leaping" has difficulties and easiness. To the north of Manchuria is the Soviet Union, and on the Soviet border, the Kwantung Army cannot leap one step. Last year, the border conflicts between Russia and Manchuria, I can't remember how many times it was. To the west of Manchuria is Outer Mongolia, and it should be easy to leap into Outer Mongolia, but it cannot be done either. So then comes a great leap in diplomacy, which is the world-shaking "Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany." Look, crossing the Soviet Union, crossing Poland, going far away to talk about anti-communism with President Hitler, what is this if not a great leap in diplomacy?

It is not only to strictly prevent the communists in one's own country, but also to go one step further and prevent communists for other countries. This is also "leaping."

○○○

"Leaping Japan's" attitude towards China is also leaping. Before the Xi'an Incident occurred, it had already decided to adopt a "power-based" "use of force" approach towards China. But from December 13th to 25th, it suddenly adopted a wait-and-see attitude. From December 26th to January 5th of the New Year, it said that it would switch from waiting and watching to taking strict monitoring. Since the 6th, it has suddenly declared its determination to use "power-based" "use of force." Although this is based on the changes within China and jumping around, from this jumping around posture, one can also see the leap of "Leaping Japan's" policy towards China.

### Obstacles to the Anglo-American Reciprocal Trade Agreement

— Star

Anglo-American cooperation is the most effective way to achieve world peace. Business cooperation between England and America is the most fundamental condition for friendship between England and America. Today, as Europe and Asia are filled with war crises, the British Minister of Commerce, Runciman, goes to Washington to negotiate an Anglo-American reciprocal trade agreement and other issues of cooperation between the two countries. Of course, it is worth our attention. Runciman's mission to the United States seems to be very important. Regarding the trade agreement issue, the currency issue, the disarmament agreement issue, the American Neutrality Act issue, the world's redistribution of raw materials issue, and even the unemployment issue, all have been discussed with the American Secretary of State Hull and President Roosevelt. Although the scope of discussion is wide, the foundation of the negotiations is very close. However, before Runciman can complete his mission, there is an obstacle that he must first break. This is America's neutrality policy.

England now very much needs the cooperation of the United States. To obtain the understanding of the United States means that England must sacrifice a little in business and diplomacy. It is not unwilling. But it wants the United States to guarantee that when England is caught in an international dispute, the United States will not undermine it or disrupt its plans. The ongoing new American Neutrality Act is what worries England the most. The current Neutrality Act expires at the end of February. Radical elements in the American Congress want to enact a more extreme law to stop the export of American goods, including not only military weapons and supplies, but also raw materials such as kerosene, cotton, wheat, copper and iron, once there is a war internationally. This is tantamount to giving up all of America's wartime foreign trade. England is the country most likely to get involved in international disputes. At the same time, it is the country that most needs economic assistance from the United States. Suppose England and America sign a reciprocal trade agreement, and British factories use American cotton as raw material, and the British people use American wheat and pork as food. Once this habit is formed, America suddenly says, "Because we are afraid of being drawn into the vortex of war, we will no longer provide the British with necessities such as cotton, wheat, coal, and iron." In this situation, England may either sit still and wait for death, allowing the enemy to win the war, or regard the United States as an enemy and send warships and planes to bomb the United States. Economic severance is even more harmful than a declaration of war in the current situation. If the United States wants to promote a neutrality policy, it cannot hope that England will lower tariffs and supply the market with American exports. If the United States wants to cooperate economically with England, it must guarantee that it will not adopt an overly extreme neutrality policy. Therefore, the neutrality policy is the biggest obstacle to the Anglo-American reciprocal trade agreement.

If wise American politicians know that it is no longer the 17th century and that international economic cooperation is the best way to solve America's domestic economic panic, perhaps this obstacle may be overcome.

### Former Japanese Army Minister General Hayashi Succeeds in Forming a Cabinet

[Military's Attitude Remains Tough] Ugaki's Efforts Ultimately Fail

[Nanjing] Although Ugaki exhausted all his efforts to form a cabinet, he failed to find room for compromise and finally entered the palace at 11:50 this morning to pay his respects to the Emperor and decline the cabinet-forming mandate. (29th, Central News Agency Electric)

[Tokyo] After Ugaki declined the mandate to form a cabinet, the Emperor ordered Hayashi Senjuro, former Army Minister in the Okada cabinet, to form a cabinet late tonight. Ugaki gave up his efforts to form a cabinet after repeatedly trying to dispel the military's opposition without success.

General Hayashi is 61 years old. Before becoming Army Minister in 1934, he held various important positions in the army. In September 1935, he resigned as Army Minister. When the September 18th Incident broke out, he was the Commander-in-Chief of the Korean Army, believing that Manchuria urgently needed reinforcements. Without obtaining the government's approval, he rashly sent troops to Manchuria. However, this move was not approved by the government afterwards. After holding an emergency meeting, the cabinet ordered the troops that had been sent out to be recalled. Hayashi is taciturn and lacks hobbies, is loyal to his duties, and has no political ambitions. (29th, Reuters)

[Tokyo] Around what time tonight, Interior Minister Yuasa returned to Tokyo from Okitsu, carrying a letter of recommendation from Prince Saionji to see the Emperor. The Emperor immediately issued a decree to former Army Minister General Hayashi Senjuro to organize a new cabinet. Before the decree was issued, Yuasa had a long discussion with Privy Council President Hiranuma Kiichiro. (29th, Central News Agency Electric)

[Tokyo] Japan's newly appointed Prime Minister, General Ugaki, gave up his efforts to form a cabinet today due to the continued obstacles from the military. Ugaki was ordered to form a cabinet five days ago, but due to military opposition, he refused to recommend candidates for the new cabinet's Army Minister. Although he repeatedly tried to mediate, it was still ineffective. Military leaders declared that any attempt by the new Prime Minister would be futile, and that the situation was like stirring hard cement with bamboo chopsticks. (29th, Reuters)

[Tokyo] Now that General Ugaki has resigned from the mandate, the question is who will be given the mandate to organize the successor cabinet. Given the fact that General Ugaki's cabinet formation work failed, judging from the current situation and the observations from all sides, the first considered most powerful person is Privy Council President Hiranuma Kiichiro, followed by former Army Minister General Hayashi Senjuro and former Navy Minister Admiral Osumi Mineo. (29th, Domei Electric)

### General Hayashi Senjuro

### Ugaki Passively Protests and Resolves to Resign from the Rank of General

Legally Requires the Army Minister's Consent; Hayashi Announces a Bomb Shell Statement; The Military Is Angry and Demands a Serious Investigation

[Tokyo] Since Ugaki received the mandate to form a cabinet on the night of the 24th, he has won widespread sympathy. After 120 hours of struggle, he finally felt that he had failed to obtain the understanding of the army and had fallen into a serious state, and had no choice but to resign. All parties deeply regret and worry about this situation. After Ugaki decided to resign from the mandate to form a cabinet last night, he also decided to resign from the rank of retired army general to clarify the responsibility for causing the army's opposition. This move can be regarded as a passive protest against the army. Ugaki's confidant, Reserve Army Lieutenant General Hayashi Ya Saburokichi, issued a so-called bomb shell statement this morning, criticizing the army's attitude very harshly. The army authorities were very angry and believed that it had damaged the military's reputation and demanded a serious investigation into the matter. Observers here had already anticipated that Ugaki had given up hope of forming a cabinet before Ugaki entered the palace to see the Emperor this morning. In Japanese history, this is the second time that a cabinet-forming mandate has been aborted due to this phenomenon (according to the 1914 Kiyoura cabinet formation, it was aborted because it failed to obtain a candidate for Navy Minister). As for the extremely complex situation that caused Ugaki's failure, it cannot be explained clearly in a few words. However, insightful observers believe that the direction of Japan's political trend and the driving force of politics have been fully revealed at this time, and one thing can be noted: it is precisely because of Ugaki's failure that the task of his successor may be easier. (29th, Central News Agency Electric)

[Tokyo] General Ugaki resigned from the mandate on the 29th, and at the same time, taking this cabinet formation as an opportunity, in view of the situation expressed within the army, he considered it inappropriate to retain the position of army general, so he expressed his determination to resign from the rank of general. However, no procedures have been taken with the Army Ministry today, because according to Article 3, Paragraph 1 of the Army Officer Law, to resign from an official position, a letter of resignation must be submitted, and the Army Minister must also agree on the responsibility of supervision. Therefore, the Army Ministry will wait for the submission of the letter before taking appropriate action. (29th, Domei Electric)

[Tokyo] General Ugaki was opposed by the army as soon as he was ordered to form a cabinet, causing the cabinet formation to be aborted. He had to resign from the mandate, and on the 28th, he decided to resign from the position of army general as well, and submitted a letter of resignation to Army Minister Terauchi. Therefore, Army Minister Terauchi and Director-General of Education Sugiyama met at the Army Minister's official residence at 3:30 pm on the 29th to discuss the above issue. (29th, Domei Electric)

### Imaidada Discusses the Cabinet Formation Process

[Tokyo] After General Ugaki resigned from the mandate, Imaidada Kiyotoku spoke to a group of reporters at 1:30 pm as follows:

We believe that if we cannot promote the reality of national unity, we cannot manage the situation. Therefore, we have implemented the thorough coordination and satisfactory policy to the end, but after all, we have had to resign from the mandate. During this period, we have caused anxiety in all circles due to the delay, and we are deeply sorry. Our actions will be based on following the correct path, attempting to achieve national unity in order to open up the situation. As for involving others or stimulating others, we will try our best to avoid it. The result of our efforts this time has been in vain, and we are truly regrettable.

Regarding the statement of Lieutenant General Hayashi Ya Saburokichi, it is said that it was not the intention of the cabinet formation headquarters. According to his statement, the statement of Lieutenant General Hayashi was made after the resignation was announced. We heard that it was the personal action of Lieutenant General Hayashi, and we were completely unaware of it. As for the fact that Lieutenant General Hayashi visited General Kawai, the cabinet formation headquarters was also unaware of it. All that we have taken so far is the correct path, and as for the fact of individual negotiations, there is absolutely nothing like that in the cabinet formation headquarters, etc. (29th, Domei Electric)

### The Democratic Political Party Announces a Statement

Hoping to Respect Constitutional Government and Expressing Sympathy for Ugaki

[Tokyo] Regarding the situation of General Ugaki's resignation from the mandate, the Democratic Political Party held a meeting of executives at the residence of President Machida, and according to information from all sides, they discussed countermeasures for the future. As a result, a statement was issued in the form of its Secretary-General, Nagai Susumuwa, as follows:

Since General Ugaki was ordered to form a cabinet, he has worked hard, but because of differences of opinion with the army, he had no choice but to resign from the mandate. At this time of internal and external difficulties, the political situation has still not stabilized, which is regrettable. We cannot help but express sympathy for General Ugaki's plight. We believe that the army should clearly state the reasons for opposing General Ugaki's cabinet formation in order to make the people understand their dispute. What we expect is that no matter who succeeds in forming a cabinet, they should follow the great meaning of constitutional politics, stand on the public opinion of the people, and form a strong cabinet so as to quickly overcome the difficult situation, reassure the Emperor, and pacify the people. Our party will, according to the statement we have already made, seriously monitor the development of the situation together with the people, etc. (29th, Domei Electric)

### Ugaki (right) Who Failed to Form a Cabinet, and Army Minister Terauchi

### Army Firmly Expresses Determination to Implement Active Policy

No Compromise with Existing Political Parties

[Tokyo] Following General Ugaki's rise to form a cabinet, regardless of who it may be, the army will, upon negotiation and recommendation of the Minister of the Army, present the following conditions and compel their implementation:

㊀ A profound understanding of the current situation is required, implementing a new administration to stabilize the national livelihood and enhance national strength. ㊁ Strengthening national defense and military preparedness is the most important national policy of Japan, and must be promoted to achieve this ideal. ㊂ The administrative structure of the central and local governments must be reformed. ㊃ A comprehensive control mechanism for national policy must be promptly established at the central level. ㊄ Establish an internal cabinet personnel control mechanism. ㊅ Reform the parliamentary system. ㊆ Revise the electoral district law to thoroughly cleanse and purify the political arena. ㊇ Absolutely reject politics that compromise and mix with existing political parties. Judging from the above situation, the army will never adopt a policy of maintaining the status quo. It is sincerely hoped that talented individuals with a reformist consciousness will form a cooperative cabinet to deal with this extraordinary period and realize the ideal of national progress. (29th Allied Press Telegram)

[Tokyo] Lieutenant General Hayashi Yasamichi, a close associate of General Ugaki involved in forming the cabinet, visited General Kawai Isoo, a senior army officer, on the 28th to report on General Ugaki's cabinet formation process and his determination, and to request cooperation. General Kawai replied that at this critical juncture, he hoped General Ugaki would act with self-restraint. (29th Allied Press Telegram)

[Tokyo] After receiving a letter from General Ugaki expressing his significant resolve, General Suzuki Soroku, starting from the 27th, avoided the turmoil of the current situation and went to Ibaraki Prefecture to give lectures, and is scheduled to return to Tokyo on the 30th.

### Japanese Ambassador to France Returns Home to Report on Duties

Talks with French Reporters on the European Situation

Marseilles Port: Japanese Ambassador to France, Sato, returned home to report on his duties. He arrived here today from Paris and boarded the Japanese mail ship "Ankoku Maru" bound for Yokohama. Before departing, he gave an interview to a Havas News Agency reporter, describing his three years in office and the friendship between France and Japan in great detail. Finally, the reporter inquired about his views on the European situation. Sato declined to offer a comprehensive assessment but said, "I can only evaluate the European situation from the perspective of the Far East. I am not overly pessimistic. Europe currently has two systems: authoritarianism and democracy. However, if the rulers of all countries, regardless of their beliefs, hold peaceful aspirations, then why can't peace be achieved? However, if some countries still lack the will for peace, there will still be many difficulties ahead for peace. I firmly believe that well-informed individuals everywhere remember the last World War, when humanity slaughtered each other for four years. We certainly do not want to see a repeat of that carnage. I dare not believe that there are still people who want to replay the tragedy of the World War, because war is not only unhelpful but only destroys everything. Therefore, I believe that peace is a treasure of mankind and must be preserved." (28th Havas Telegram)

The twelve aircraft carried a total of eighty people and traveled 2,553 miles from San Diego to Honolulu, taking 21 hours and 53 minutes. (29th Reuters Telegram)

### United States Considers Permanent Neutrality

Authorities Draft Bill

[Washington] The current U.S. Neutrality Act is about to expire. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Representative McReynolds, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, have both drafted new Neutrality Bills, preparing to submit them to Congress for discussion, and advocating for a ban on the transportation of raw materials to belligerent nations. It is learned that after British Trade Minister Runciman recently came to the United States and held talks with Secretary of State Hull, the U.S. government has decided to abandon the proposal to ban the transportation of raw materials to belligerent nations. President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and former Disarmament Conference Representative Davis considered this matter for many days. Finally, because the United States almost entirely imports the rubber, tin, and nickel it needs from the territories of the British Empire, if a new Neutrality Act were implemented and raw materials were banned from export, then Britain would respond with retaliatory measures. Since Runciman made no secret of this, the U.S. government has cancelled the ban on exporting raw materials. (29th Havas Telegram)

### Draft Plan for Monitoring Spanish Sea and Land Borders

Adjustment Committee Submits to Relevant Governments, Implementation Scheduled After Receiving Replies

[London] The subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War held a meeting this afternoon and decided to submit a draft proposal for implementing monitoring of the Spanish sea and land borders (the sea monitoring plan to be implemented with the assistance of the naval fleets of various countries) to the governments of relevant countries and request that they submit their replies by February 4th. In addition to the above draft proposal, the subcommittee also decided to submit a questionnaire to the governments of relevant countries, listing the following questions: ㊀ Should the arrival of foreign volunteer soldiers in Spain and the transportation of military supplies to Spain be monitored? ㊁ Should land monitoring be conducted on the border between Spain and France, the border between Spain and Portugal, and the British territory of Gibraltar? ㊂ Should all Spanish ports be monitored? ㊃ Should all ships traveling to Spain be monitored? ㊄ Should the coast of Spain be monitored by the naval fleets of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany? Should the governments of relevant countries agree to the above five measures, they should fill out and answer each item. In addition, it is heard that the questionnaire also included suggestions regarding the date of implementation of the monitoring. It is expected that the subcommittee will meet next Tuesday to decide on the date of implementation of the monitoring, as the replies from the governments of various countries should have been received by then. Furthermore, individuals close to the delegations of various countries attending the Adjustment Committee are deeply concerned that this proposal will be thwarted again due to Portugal's opposition. During the subcommittee meeting today, the Portuguese representative stated that this monitoring method does not carry a kind of "trick," but he clarified that this was his personal opinion and that he would still submit the subcommittee's draft proposal to his government. What decision his government will make cannot be predicted. In addition, the representatives of Italy and Germany did not raise any objections to the subcommittee's proposals, which is quite noteworthy. (28th Havas Telegram)

[Berlin] Regarding the issue of prohibiting volunteer soldiers from going to Spain to serve, after the German government sent a reply to the British government a few days ago, the British Ambassador to Germany visited Foreign Minister Neurath today to express gratitude and inform him that the London Adjustment Committee will consider the suggestions made in the German reply. (Note: The most important of Germany's suggestions is that ㊀ the Adjustment Committee should immediately find a way to enable the main relevant countries to establish an agreement on the main measures for non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, their implementation dates, and the various principles of the future monitoring system; ㊁ the military personnel of various countries currently assisting in the war in Spain must be withdrawn.)

### German Policy Toward Spain to Change

[London] A reporter for the News Chronicle in Berlin claims that he sent out a message last week stating that German Aviation Minister General Göring had suggested to Mussolini during a recent visit to Rome that Germany and Italy jointly send 80,000 troops to Spain to assist in the war. The authorities in Berlin were furious after this message was sent, so he was not allowed to attend the Reichstag meeting tomorrow as a punishment. However, a certain diplomat has confirmed this message. The reason for the Berlin authorities' anger is that the German government's policy on the Spanish issue has changed and it does not want to recklessly do things that contradict the above message.

### Soviet Prosecutor Demands Death Penalty for Seventeen Defendants

Two Scientists and Artists, Unanimously Demanding Severe Punishment, Trotsky's Sister and Nephew Arrested

[Moscow] Regarding the Trotskyite counter-revolutionary case, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court has concluded the trial of the seventeen defendants. Chief Prosecutor Vyshinsky presented the indictment, using extremely strong language, essentially making the defendants' conspiracies and atrocities into an ironclad case that cannot be overturned. It stated that the defendants betrayed their country, undermined the socialist system, colluded with fascists, and established a branch of the German secret police. The evidence is overwhelming and indisputable. They deserve the death penalty. In particular, the defendant Pyatakov opposed Lenin as early as 1915 and tried to sabotage the Brest-Litovsk Treaty. He was also the organizer of the "Parallel Center" organization and other sabotage activities. His conclusion was that these people were murderers who secretly colluded with foreign countries to make their country submit and surrender. Then, the lawyers for the defendants began their defense. The lawyer for Knyazev, Belotkov, said that the real culprits were Trotsky and Japanese espionage agencies. The defendant Knyazev has now sincerely repented and asked the court to be lenient. Another defendant, Arnot's lawyer, Gasnachev, said that Arnot joined the Trotskyites out of fear due to blackmail and threats to his life from the Trotskyites, but he did not commit any crimes and should be granted leniency by the court. (29th Havas Telegram)

[Moscow] When the prosecutor spoke, Radek, Pyatakov, and Sokolnikov all lowered their heads to their chests and covered their faces with their hands. The prosecutor made a fist-shaking gesture towards the three and rebuked them, saying, "You are all Trotskyite bandits who are willing to sell Soviet Russia to Japan and Germany." The prosecutor also denounced the heinous crimes of the defendants and called them "Trotskyite conspirators." Finally, he directly addressed Radek and Pyatakov, saying, "You have committed extremely serious crimes. You have become the vanguard of the fascist international." (29th Reuters Telegram)

[Moscow] During the public trial today, Radek and Pyatakov both confessed to conspiring to sell Soviet Russia to foreign countries. Both Radek and Pyatakov were willing to be executed. Pyatakov even expressed regret that Trotsky was still at large and unable to share their guilt. Finally, he asked the court to believe that he was no longer a Trotskyite at the time of his death. Radek's attitude was different. He claimed that he should be fully responsible for the crimes he committed and did not need to be incited by Trotsky. He once called Judge Ulrikh "comrade," which was rebuked by Ulrikh. Finally, Radek turned to the foreign reporters listening in the courtroom and shouted, "I have secretly planned an international disaster." Sokolnikov, who previously served as the ambassador to Britain, was the first among the defendants to request leniency. When he finished his confession, he said tearfully, "My crime deserves death, but I ask the judge to consider the circumstances." (29th Reuters Telegram)

[Moscow] Nineteen well-known Soviet scientists, including Academician Komarov of the Academy of Sciences, research scholars Bakh, Keller, Arkhangelsky, Vavilov, Gubkin, Krzhizhanovsky, etc., recently published an open letter demanding that the court severely punish the traitors and strictly investigate and prosecute Bukharin, Rykov, and Uglanov for their participation in Trotskyite activities. The letter stated, "We will use all our knowledge and ability to further promote the rapid development and prosperity of our great socialist motherland and further consolidate the power of the Red Army, the true guardians of our Soviet borders." Forty-three well-known painters and sculptors, including Gerasimov, Yuon, Moor, Lansere, Grabar, Favorsky, Makulov, Mendeleev, etc., declared, "All the people of the Soviet Union who love their free country unanimously demand that the fascist poisonous snakes be completely eliminated from now on, that the Trotskyite stains in Soviet Russia be cleared away, and that solidarity be strengthened to support the leaders of all parties and governments and the national beloved leader Stalin." Forty-five thousand workers, engineers, and technicians from the Moscow Automobile Plant declared, "Our response to the conspiracies of the counter-revolutionary Trotskyites and rightists is to unanimously exert all our efforts to fulfill the tasks we have set for ourselves in 1937. We will increase labor productivity by 24 percent. We will reduce defective products and launch a broad struggle to enable all manual workers to obtain the experience of Stakhanov workers." Female switch operator Nagovitsyna wrote to Prosecutor Vyshinsky, "Because I rescued a train loaded with stove medicine from danger at the Zhusovskaya station, my legs were crushed. The destructive hands of the saboteurs moved the switch to connect with the tracks where the train was stopped. As a result, the station's destruction and the deaths of thousands of hundreds of people would have been inevitable, but I finally fulfilled my responsibility and avoided this terrible danger. Now I know who took my legs and prepared this terrifying danger. They took my legs, but they cannot take away my happiness. I am enjoying the happy life of a happy daughter of our motherland. I am only twenty years old, and I will curse their names for the rest of my life. I ask you to demand that the murderers be sentenced to death in your speech." (28th TASS Telegram)

[Paris] Le Matin recently reported that after the second son of Trotsky, the leader of the anti-cadre faction of the Soviet Communist Party, was arrested in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, yesterday, Trotsky's sister and nephew were also arrested there. In addition, Radek's mother, a defendant in the "Parallel Center" case, is currently in Warsaw and did send a telegram to Stalin and Stalin's mother, pleading for amnesty for Radek, but has not yet received a reply from Stalin as of yet.

Portuguese Territory in Africa to be Managed by Germany - Portuguese Official Statement Denies It

[Paris] The "Journal" carries a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent, stating that Germany and Portugal have recently signed an agreement stipulating that the Portuguese government should open its African colony of Angola on a broad scale to meet Germany's needs for colonization and management, while Portugal does not relinquish sovereignty over the colony. The agreement is valid for ninety-nine years. It is generally believed that Germany will provide Portugal with a large amount of goods, worth approximately 400 million gold marks, as compensation for granting this concession. According to the Journal's correspondent, this news is authentic and can be published without fear of denial. Furthermore, when German leader Hitler delivers his peace speech in the Reichstag on the 30th of this month, he may announce the conclusion of this agreement between Germany and Portugal, regarding it as "a great victory for peace," which is highly probable. The correspondent also stated that the agreement was negotiated by Mr. Huigert, director of the German Gold Discount Bank, who is now preparing to implement a similar plan for the French mandate territory of Cameroon, formerly a German colony before the war. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

Lisbon Regarding the rumors that the Portuguese government has concluded an agreement with Germany to provide the Portuguese territory of Angola in Africa for German colonization and management, the Portuguese Prime Minister's Office has issued a public statement, resolutely denying it. However, it stated that negotiations are currently underway regarding the mutual exchange of raw materials produced in Portuguese colonies and German industrial products, and that an agreement has been reached, but the quantity is limited, far behind the trade volume between Germany and other countries.

### Japanese Actively Promote Northeast Five-Year Gold Production Plan

Adopting Large Amounts of Money to Replenish National Defense Finances - Implementing Continental Policy to Win Without Fighting

Changchun Correspondence: Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese have been engaged in gold mining in the Northeast for five years. They have implemented their so-called five-year gold production plan starting this year, so this year is the sixth year. In the past, the Japanese believed that the first phase of

Foundation Construction has been completed. Now they are actively promoting the so-called second phase of the leap era, boasting that this will bring epoch-making progress to the Northeast's politics, economy, and finance. This is because they take the controlled economy as the foundation, and take the comprehensive national policy of Japan as the guideline for appropriate operation. As far as the Japanese gold mining industry is concerned, at the beginning of the establishment of the puppet organization, due to its special nature, it was placed under control, and thus achieved extraordinary

Progress. Looking at the amount of gold produced, the amount of gold produced under the control of Japanese companies was 507,000 yuan in the Japanese Showa 9th year (Republic of China 23rd year), 3.67 million yuan in the Japanese Showa 10th year (Republic of China 24th year), and 10 million yuan in the Japanese Showa 11th year (Republic of China 25th year), that is, the annual average increase is about three times the previous year. The Japanese are very optimistic about this, believing that if they continue in this way, the annual output will reach 100 million yuan, which is not far away. The Japanese also believe that they can have such good results because of their control. As for other

Reasons, the progress of the mining operations directly managed by Japanese companies, first, Xiaoshitou south of Jiamusi is mined by hand, and now there are about 7,000 gold miners. Under the control of Japanese companies, they are engaged in gold mining. In the past, Xiaoshitou was originally a small village with only dozens of houses. Later, the Japanese survey team discovered gold mines there, and summoned gold miners to mine, resulting in a concentration of population. Now the population has reached more than 20,000, actually a large town. The Japanese also set up all entertainment facilities in the area. The amount of gold produced is also very

Abundant. From January to December last year, it was 3.4 million yuan, accounting for more than one-third of the total gold production in the Northeast last year, because it has reached 400,000 to 500,000 yuan per month since August last year. There are also other discoveries of new gold mines. The Japanese have a hope that they will develop greatly in the future. Second, the Niaoqiu River in the Xiaoxinganling Mountains about 200 miles southwest of Heihe is suitable for the operation of gold dredging ships due to terrain. Since last year, construction has been carried out. It was completed at the end of October last year and has started

Mining. Because of its good results, the Japanese also believe that its future activity can be eagerly awaited. According to this type of gold dredging ship, its single bucket has a capacity of 5 cubic feet, weighs 700 tons, and is 540 horsepower. The mining capacity of one month can reach 120,000 cubic yards. The amazing mechanization of gold dredging ships can be described as a new era in the Japanese's ideal gold mining method in the Northeast. Currently, Japanese companies are continuing to add gold dredging ships. As for the energy of gold dredging ships, they are the same type as dredging ships. Gold mining equipment is installed on the top of the ship. Currently, the largest of the Japanese plans is a gold dredging ship with a volume of 15 cubic meters. Its

Hull is 45 meters long, 18 meters wide, 19.5 meters high, weighs 1,000 tons, has 1,200 horsepower, and has a monthly mining capacity of 400,000 cubic yards. Employees are divided into three shifts, day and night, and only 29 people are required to operate. Its mining capacity is equal to 7,000 gold miners. The Japanese have also discovered a large placer gold mine in Tumenzi. The placer gold there is different from the ordinary state, it is on the mountain. If you feel that there is not enough washing water, you can make a sluice gate at the high place of the water and use 200 feet or 300 feet of high falling water pressure to mine placer gold. The Japanese are currently

Preparing. Although this method has no precedent in Japan's mainland and Korea, when it is completed in the future, the amount of gold produced in the area will undoubtedly make an extraordinary leap forward. In addition, there are the Huma River Basin, the Aben'er River Basin, the Mudanjiang Aodi in Tangyuan County, and Huaxun County, etc. All very promising placer gold mines have been discovered by the Japanese one after another. As for mountain gold, there are Kaishantun on the border between Korea and the Northeast, and Qinglin in the Mudanjiang area. The Japanese have completed the survey and are now actively preparing to mine. All gold mining operations in the Northeast are planned based on the gold mining companies established by the Japanese, and they follow the Japanese national policy mission of the Northeast Five-Year Industrial Plan, so there is a five-year gold production plan.

Establish. The target of this plan, starting from this year, is 100 million yuan for the amount of gold produced. The first year is 14 million yuan, the second year is 22 million yuan, the third year is 36 million yuan, the fourth year is 55 million yuan, and the fifth year is 82 million yuan. However, the total amount of gold produced in the above five years is more than 200 million yuan, which is the amount of gold produced within the scope of Japanese companies. If the entire Northeast is included, such as the entry and participation of Japanese mainland capitalists, it is possible to reach 400 million or 500 million yuan. It is indeed the Japanese's plan to produce gold.

Progress is to actively prepare the national defense finance for the Japanese puppet international relations and to assist the implementation of Japan's large-scale immigration policy, and to raise huge funds for it. Furthermore, the financial situation in the Northeast is now in a malignant inflationary situation. The Japanese intend to expand their economic authority, so they urgently plan to

Replenish the gold mining plan, so that a large amount of money can be obtained to solve the urgent needs. The so-called replenishment of positive currency reserves to consolidate the fiscal foundation of the Japanese puppet state, increase national defense power can exert its huge combat power, and the so-called winning without fighting is the best policy. The so-called root of Japan's continental policy and the foundation of East Asian hegemony.

### Sungkiang Factory Owner's Wife Directs Robbery

As the winter defense season arrives, and it is also the end of the lunar year, military police are densely deployed in the city and suburbs, with patrols never ceasing. However, at 11:00 AM on the 27th, Yang Zhenqing's house on Kuo Street outside the West Gate was actually robbed by a gang, which is shocking. Subsequently, Yang Shijie, the detective captain of the Public Security Bureau, tracked down and arrested three people on the same day: Xu Ronglin, Zhang Asan, and Zhu Kehong. They were taken to the bureau for preliminary interrogation. Xu Ronglin confessed that he was 25 years old, from Ningbo, and currently lived at No. 36 outside the South Gate of Jiashan. This time, he received a letter from Qian Gao, the wife of the owner of the Yun Jian Battery Factory in Songjiang, inviting him to Songjiang, explaining that she wanted to rob the Yang family. He summoned Zhang Asan and Zhu Kehong. They arrived in Songjiang on the 27th. After eating noodles at a noodle restaurant, Qian Gao pointed out the entrance of the Yang family. Another person, whose name is unknown, called the door to enter. First, they met a young master wearing glasses, and immediately tied him up, followed by tying up a young girl. However, there was another woman who ran upstairs to inform the neighbors that they had encountered thieves and called the police. Then, the person whose name is unknown robbed the gold chain around the old lady's neck. I immediately snatched it, ran out of the gate, and tied the gold chain to the account table of the battery factory. I hired a rickshaw to the railway station and escaped along the railway line. He was arrested by the detective team who were in hot pursuit. According to Yang's confession, he immediately searched the battery factory. As the thief was not found after a day, he brought Qian Gao to the case, and the robbers all identified him one by one. It was indeed Qian Gao who instigated it. However, Qian Gao still vehemently denied it. Everyone said that it was extremely daring and evil to carry out robberies in the bustling city. It is said that the authorities will punish him with military law to deter bandits.

### A Proposal Amidst the Prohibition of Opium in Taicang

Lu Boquan, a local resident, wrote to Magistrate Wen yesterday, saying, "Thanks to the magistrate's combination of kindness and sternness, the opium prohibition in this county has indeed achieved remarkable results. It will not be difficult to completely eliminate it within the prescribed time limit. My admiration is beyond words. However, recently, the county hospital, due to the large number of opium addicts being persuaded and voluntarily giving up opium, has often heard of perfunctory actions. Recently, Li Axing, an opium addict from Zhitang Town in the sixth district, was persuaded to enter the hospital on December 19, 25th year, and was discharged from the hospital after giving up opium on the 30th of the same month, receiving a paper with the hospital's opium addict examination form No. 549 and an opium abstention certificate No. 1365. The ignorant opium addicts who are persuaded are deeply happy to regain their freedom at present, but they do not know that the crime of relapse after giving up opium has invisibly surrounded them, and there is no way to get rid of it. Opium addiction is not a matter of a day or two, and the difficulty of eradicating it is a hundred times greater than addiction. This is recognized by doctors and opium addicts. Now Li Axing can quit his chronic illness in a short time of one day and one night, who will believe it? When the follow-up is carried out in the future, punishing him with the crime of relapse would be too unjust. The only way to remedy it is to order Director Qiu by the magistrate to properly persuade Li Axing and similar opium addicts who have given up opium again to comply with the decree and respect humanity. If my humble suggestions are adopted, the poor opium addicts will kowtow nine times to thank you. Furthermore, after the opium addicts of the lower classes are discharged from the hospital, they are eager to start working, and they cannot avoid being caught in the legal net. The law cannot be forgiven, but the circumstances are still understandable. In the future, it is best to allow them to stay in the hospital for recuperation for a few days after giving up opium. This is an act of grace beyond the law, which I believe the magistrate will be happy to grant."

### Large Number of Opium Addicts Arrested in Suzhou

The Wu County government was ordered to carry out a general re-examination of opium addicts, which has been completed. The Public Security Bureau immediately ordered the police stations in urban and rural areas to strictly arrest opium addicts. In recent days, more than a thousand people have been arrested, all of whom have been sent to the county government for disposal by the Public Security Bureau. The county government will re-examine those opium addicts who deny smoking, and order those who admit to smoking to abstain from opium before sentencing them to imprisonment according to law. Therefore, the opium addict detention centers and county hospitals have been overcrowded in recent days. In order to alleviate the situation, the county government will allow those who have been sentenced to imprisonment for six months or less to commute their sentences to fines. The Director of Public Security has issued a notice to all his subordinates to mobilize the entire force to arrest opium addicts in these three days from the 29th to the 31st. Anyone who is seen smoking in tea houses, restaurants, and public entertainment venues will be immediately arrested and sent to the county for investigation. On the 29th, in the urban area, the police stations arrested no less than 300 opium addicts, most of whom were disheveled and dirty. They were all sent to the bureau and then to the county for disposal.

### Changshu Citizens Correct the Tax Deed Office

Recently, the Tax Office of the local county government has been imposing penalties on those whose house deeds have incomplete renovation accounts. Now, citizens such as Jin Shuhe and others believe that this is an improper action by the county government, and they have jointly presented a petition to the county, requesting correction. The reason is that recently, the county government taxes house deeds, and if it finds renovation deeds, regardless of whether they are old or modern, it orders them to pay taxes and penalties. However, after checking the provisional regulations for tax verification issued by the national government before November of the 16th year, there is no such provision. The current county government's actions clearly violate this, and the people suffer this extra loss, which is too much. It is reported that the county government has approved the matter for investigation and handling.

### Wuxi County-Wide Land Registration

The local Land Administration Bureau has completed the land registration for the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh districts of the county. However, there are still a few owners who have not performed their obligations for a long time. Director Hu has decided to set a reminder period from February 1st to the 28th. All unregistered owners should quickly register within the deadline to avoid losing property rights. Also, the registration for the first district will begin in mid-February. Four land registration offices will be set up, and the bureau will send staff to verify the maps on-site and issue small tickets. Then, registration will be done with the tickets, and a registration fee of one cent will be charged. The remaining eighth, ninth, and tenth districts will begin around mid-February.

Establishment of the Ship Inspection Office

The local Public Security Bureau believes that water security is extremely important during this winter defense period. Therefore, Director Zhang of the Public Security Bureau, together with Qian Zhongliang, the chief of the first district, established the Ship Inspection Office at the original site of the card office in front of Huangbudun Building, Louxia Building, outside the North Gate. A water patrol team member has been appointed to start inspections from today (30th) to maintain local security.

The Suzhou-Wuxi Road Opens to Traffic in One Day

The entire route of the Suzhou-Wuxi Road has been completed. The Suzhou Provincial Highway Administration has scheduled the official opening of traffic on February 1st. Mr. Tie Shanshan was dispatched to Wuxi in advance to prepare. The Suzhou-Wuxi Line Office is located at Beizhakou. All vehicles have also been transported to Wuxi and installed. The main station is attached to the Xicheng Company, and branch stations are set up in Huishan, Yinglong Bridge, Zhongqiao Town, Nanqiao Town, Zhouxin Town, Huadafangzhuang, Xin'an Town, Wangting, Tong'anqiao Town, Ertu Town, Guanqiao Town, and Shanren Bridge, etc. The 12 locations operate on the bus and stop along the way to benefit merchants.

### Changzhou Widens Streets in the Urban Area

In order to prosper the urban market and facilitate transportation, the Wujin County government plans to widen North-South Avenue, Juqian Street, East-West County Heng Street, and Fu Zhi Street in the downtown area. After sending staff to measure, it was submitted to the political affairs meeting last month and approved. It was also stipulated that the width should be uniformly widened to 12 meters, including 7 meters for the roadway and 2.5 meters for the sidewalks on both sides. The road surface is paved with stone slabs. The county government is responsible for 40% of the funding, and the residents on both sides are responsible for 60%. The county government then prepared planning charts and submitted them to the Construction Department for verification and instructions. Yesterday, news was received from the province that the Construction Department had ordered the filing of this planning facility. After receiving the order, the county government immediately started to invite merchants to contract the project and implement the widening to facilitate transportation.

### Yangzhou Bandits Rob in a Cart

The house of Ding Wansong, a farmer in Zhuang Ertou, Yiling East Township, Sixth District of Jiangdu, was robbed at night on the 26th by seven bandits speaking with Qinghuai accent and local accent. They broke into the house by holding earthen guns and iron forks over the reed fence in the courtyard, rushed open the door, and three bandits dragged Ding and his wife out of the quilt and tied them up, forcing them to confess the location of the silver. They stabbed Ding's leg very deeply with an iron fork. The remaining bandits divided up clothes, foreign goods, and valuables, and loaded them into a cart they brought with them, and roared away. When the neighbors heard the alarm and beat gongs to call for help, the bandits had already fled far away. It is estimated that the loss was more than 500 yuan.

### Ningbo Qita Temple Abbot Ascends the Throne

Qita Temple in Jiangdong, Ningbo, is a well-known Buddhist monastery in eastern Zhejiang. The term of office of the abbot, Ning Chang, has expired. After public election by various branches, Zhizhen, the abbot of Dantuan Kan Jing Temple, was promoted. On the 27th, the new and old abbots went through the handover procedures. At 7 o'clock in the morning, a car was sent to pick him up. Tu Ying led people to the mountain gate, ascended the altar to perform the ascension ceremony and held rituals such as lecturing and chanting scriptures.

### Random Notes from a European Trip

— Our European Correspondent, Lieshan

Sixteen - Performing Chinese Etiquette

Once, at a social gathering, I was introduced to a certain German middle school teacher, Mr. So-and-so. As usual, we exchanged names and shook hands. But after this gentleman shook hands, he just smiled at me without saying a word. Half a minute passed, then a minute passed. We were still just standing there. I thought, "Oh no, he's not a mute, but he doesn't seem like an idiot either. There must be some secret to this." I asked him if it was because it was the first time he had seen a Chinese person, so he was too frightened to speak. He found this strange. He was performing the most respectful Chinese etiquette towards me! How could I not understand? Ha, performing Chinese etiquette, running into someone and not saying a word – this was practically news! Apparently, he had read about it in a book, and it was described as a very grand etiquette, only used when meeting an official. I asked him, "When performing this kind of etiquette, how many minutes are both parties supposed to remain silent before speaking?" At that, it was as if I wasn't even Chinese, since I didn't even know this etiquette. He laughed. This one detail, the author apparently had not mentioned. I said, "Sir, look, this detail is very important. The author should not have forgotten to mention it. For example, if we had just kept performing Chinese etiquette without any time limit, we would have ended up mute!"

Seventeen - Chinese People Kiss with Their Noses

Many Chinese etiquettes, not only do we ourselves not know, but we can't even find any basis for them by scouring ancient books. But Europeans understand them very clearly. For example, Europeans say that Chinese people kiss with their noses.

Why do Chinese people use their noses to kiss? Is it because they are concerned about hygiene? In Europe, it seems impossible to find a definite answer. Even the famous writer Madame Buck only offers a negative explanation for this question. She only portrays how young Chinese men and women do not like to kiss, considering it a foreign custom. Since Madame Buck has said that Chinese people do not know about kissing, then Chinese people kissing with their noses is probably at least partly correct.

Chinese people living in Europe often spend a lot of time arguing over this "nose" issue.

I remember once, a classmate was invited by a certain foreign organization to give a lecture on the topic of "Chinese Customs." After the lecture, a lady stood up and asked him, "Is it true that Chinese people kiss with their noses?" This classmate was stunned for a moment, but immediately replied in a very playful tone, "Most respected lady, if you don't believe it, I can try it out on you right now!" This caused the entire audience to burst into laughter.

Eighteen - Another Perspective

For decades, China has been accustomed to the oppression of imperialist guns and cannons. The general public has lost its self-confidence, always believing that domestic goods are inferior to foreign goods. Any foreigner, even a nobody, who comes to China is considered a "foreign master." The reason: things from abroad are always better.

The opposite is true of Europeans. In addition to considering themselves a superior race, they believe that everything from their own country is superior to that of others. It is not easy to get them to admire you. Unless you can knock them down to the ground, only then will they think you are a hero.

Recently, a great statesman has suddenly appeared in European newspapers. That is to say, a great statesman whom even Europeans admire. This statesman is Chinese: Mr. Chiang Kai-shek.

In the past, Chiang Kai-shek only occupied an ordinary position in European newspapers. People thought he was nothing more than a figure like Wu Peifu and Zhang Zuolin. But after the Guangdong-Guangxi problem was peacefully resolved and China was officially unified, on that very day, the European newspapers immediately changed their tone, as if they had discovered a new person. Suddenly, you would hear that China was reviving, and I would say that General Chiang Kai-shek was an incredible person, a brilliant military leader, a great statesman, and a great diplomat. Someone would say that General Chiang Kai-shek was already a key figure on the international political stage. Taking advantage of his fiftieth birthday, European newspapers all published special articles introducing him. Everyone said that he was the symbol of modern China, the only leader capable of saving China. This was the first time in history that a Chinese politician had gained international renown. It is embarrassing to say that we Chinese ourselves still do not have a clear understanding of Mr. Chiang Kai-shek. The reason, according to a British reporter, is because Mr. Chiang Kai-shek is not good at public speaking. But in the eyes of Europeans, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek is already a great man of the twentieth century. His position is the same as Stalin, Mussolini, Hitler, and General Kemal. As a German newspaper put it, his fate is the fate of the Chinese nation.

On October 29th of this year, the British Daily Telegraph published a long article introducing Mr. Chiang Kai-shek. One passage said that General Chiang Kai-shek has the ability of calm and far-sightedness. There are only a few people in the world who can be compared to him, but no one surpasses him.

### Inter-City Football Team Second Trial Today

Ideal Team vs. China Team: 3:00 PM at Shen Garden, Rain Changes to Tomorrow; Group A Match: Jinan vs. St. Francis

The Shanghai team selection for the Hong Kong-Shanghai inter-city football match has been changed three times, reducing the team from seventeen to fifteen players. After the second trial match, there may be a final decision. The second trial match was scheduled for 3:00 PM today at Shen Garden. Due to Xu Yahui's return to Xiamen, the China team has also added Wang Kehou as a representative. All selected players from both sides will have the opportunity to play today. As usual, the most standard ideal lineup will appear first, and then the captain will assign appropriate players to substitute in. If the China team can fully respond and focus on their weaknesses, they may be able to show the heroic spirit of Innes last year. The China team has a total of sixteen players, with Donghua accounting for three-quarters, which is equivalent to a well-trained team. The inter-city team has complex members and has not had sufficient training opportunities, so cooperation is inevitably a makeshift. In terms of communication, the China team already has an advantage over the inter-city team. Players from both sides must arrive at the field before 2:30 PM. If it rains unfortunately today, the trial match will be postponed to tomorrow, and the location will still be Shen Garden. As for the league matches, there were originally two Group A matches today. Jinan will play against St. Francis. Portugal and West Merchants will clash tomorrow because some players are attending the inter-city trial match. The Group C match between Junior and Weitishi will be held today instead. The schedule for today and the list of players from both China and the inter-city team are recorded below.

### Zhu Qiliang Defeats Left-Handed General Zhu Qiliang Defeats Left-Handed General

Finals Set for Four Matches Over Two Days Next Month (4th & 5th); Won 1,000 to 626 Last Night

In the Shanghai Amateur Billiards Group A Championship, Zhu Qiliang defeated left-handed General Wu Chengxiang last night with a score of 1,000 to 626. He will compete with Zhang Yingda in four final matches over two days on February 4th and 5th, for a total of 2,000 points. The honor of champion and runner-up will be entirely occupied by Chinese players, creating an unprecedented record in the Shanghai billiards world.

Zhu Qiliang's victory last night was not as unpredictable as his victory over Ding Mingyi the previous night. The entire situation was under his control, and he safely reached his goal. The record of his shots was also very impressive. At the end of the first half, the score was 495 to 128.

Left-handed General Wu Chengxiang was not as good at shooting as usual, and his signature moves were greatly reduced. His luck was particularly bad, and he could hardly believe his performance. The second half was slightly better than the first half. His largest single shot of 45 points was also made in the second half.

Zhu Qiliang (First Half): 24•22•24•24•52•32•20•27•46•29•23• (Second Half): 38•45•25•26•78•46•

### Shen Garden Basketball Black Team Lost to Macklin Yesterday

First Half 21 to 8, Total 45 to 34

There were two basketball games at Shen Garden yesterday. The first was between Liangxi and the Eagles in Group A, Part B. Liangxi's momentum was very strong, leading 18 to 13 in the first half, and ultimately winning 34 to 24. The second game was between the Black team and Macklin in Group A. The beginning was very even. Jia Youliang broke the record, and Kaiton tied the score. Xu Jusheng then led 4 to 2, and Pan Rose made it 4 to 4. After Xu Jusheng broke through with 6 to 4, Macklin's Locke and Brett exceeded them by making two scores. From then on, the Black team fell into a slump and was swept away by Macklin, ending the first half 21 to 8. The Black team was far behind. After the break, the Black team was unhappy internally, and Xu Jusheng announced his retirement, causing Macklin to add up to 30 to 10. After the Black team's Bai Qixilin made consecutive bullseyes, Zhang Shaoqing was also invincible. The score increased sharply, and at the closest point, it was chased to 29 to 38. At this time, Locke had been closely monitored by Zhang Shaoqing and had no development. The Black team had hopes of winning. Xu Jusheng also became a "married woman" again and made many contributions. However, in the last six minutes, Macklin's momentum suddenly turned strong again, and the Black team lost seven points in an instant. The score then moved to 45 to 29, and it was difficult to reverse the situation. Although the Black team's Xu and Zhang added another five points later, time waited for no one. The whistle had already sounded a long cry. Because the Black team lost too much in the first half, it was difficult to recover the lost ground. Although Kaiton had a foul opportunity at the end, Zhang Shaoqing was also depressed and missed the penalty. They were惨败 by Macklin with a score of 45 to 34. The Black team's luck was very bad yesterday. It is estimated that the ball hit the hoop and bounced out as many as sixteen times.

### Several Secondary Education Issues Related to English Teaching (3)

— Wang Shijie

Third, secondary education should cultivate students' initiative, not only in academic research but also in dealing with matters. Students should develop a spirit of initiative so that after graduating from secondary education, they can study new knowledge if they go on to higher education, and create new careers if they go to work. In short, it is to cultivate students' ability to cope with changes. The ability to cope with changes I am talking about here is used in a very broad sense, not just referring to certain dangerous changes encountered in society. We spend years or more than a decade in school before entering society. The things we encounter in society, whether they are academic, professional, technical, or related to people, or even relations between countries, inevitably involve situations we have never experienced before. This is a broad sense of change. When such a situation occurs, the education that the person at the forefront has received, whether in school or outside of school, will encounter irreconcilable and uncompromising tests. No matter how many years a person has spent in school, it can only be determined whether he has received practical education training when he encounters this kind of test. This is true not only in terms of knowledge and skills, but also in terms of behavior and integrity, we are constantly encountering some tests of change to determine whether we have received practical training in cultivation. In this way, we can see that the cultivation of knowledge and the cultivation of conduct are inseparably linked. The curriculum in school should be regarded merely as a tool for cultivating this ability to cope with changes. Students who can only stick to the rules and do mechanical work cannot open up new territories in scholarship, cannot create new things in their careers, cannot shoulder great responsibilities in society, and cannot take advantage of opportunities to develop their own future or the welfare of society. Cultivating students' spirit of initiative in knowledge is a major key in the era of secondary education.

Fourth, secondary education should be adapted to the needs of the country and society. This issue should be considered from two aspects. On the one hand, secondary schools prepare students for further education, and on the other hand, they prepare students for entering society and working. People who run secondary education should plan these two aspects according to a standard so that both sides can be given equal consideration, and according to a systematic plan, so that the educational level of both sides can reach a minimum and most appropriate limit. The needs of the country and society, especially in China today, have basic requirements for these two aspects of secondary education that cannot be reduced. As everyone knows, the current classification of secondary schools is that middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools are run separately, concentrating the preparation for further education in middle schools and the training of vocational skills in vocational schools. This is a policy determined on the basis of many years of experience and determined to abandon the previous mixed system, and should not be changed lightly. However, judging from the current situation of secondary education in China, I am afraid that it is far from this goal. In recent years, Chinese secondary education has paid too much attention to the first aspect and almost completely ignored the second aspect, making secondary education biased towards further education and completely obliterating the aspect of preparing students to enter society and work. This extremely unreasonable trend can be seen from several things. First, there are too many middle schools and too few vocational schools and normal schools. According to the education statistics of the Republic of China in 1932, middle schools account for nearly 63% of the number of secondary schools in the country, normal schools account for less than 19%, and vocational schools account for less than 9%. Of the number of students in secondary schools across the country, 75 out of every 100 are middle school students, less than 19 are normal school students, and less than 7 are vocational school students. The distribution of funding for secondary schools also shows the same proportion. There are more than 500,000 students in secondary schools across the country, and more than 400,000 of them are middle school students. When the state runs education, it uses huge amounts of money and the hard work of countless people. At a minimum, it hopes that every young person who is about to become an adult can do something truly useful and beneficial in society. If these more than 400,000 young people all use their talents, how much good should they accumulate for society? However, it is a very big question whether the practical education that most students in general middle schools receive in six years can achieve this minimum purpose. Looking at the current situation of students in secondary schools going on to higher education, there are approximately 9,000 graduates from senior high schools, approximately 7,000 graduates from senior normal schools, and less than 3,000 graduates from senior vocational schools each year. In total, there are approximately 20,000 people. In principle, these 20,000 people are all qualified to apply to universities or vocational colleges. However, according to the statistics already known for the 25th year of the Republic of China, universities and vocational colleges across the country recruit a total of approximately 54,000 people each year, and less than 10,000 people are admitted, which is less than 18%. The total number of university students in the country is also only more than 40,000. According to these standards, 90% of the more than 400,000 middle school students do not have the opportunity to go on to higher education. Looking at the current equipment situation of general universities, it seems that they can only accommodate a part of the graduates of senior secondary schools with their maximum annual enrollment capacity. Since the rest of the graduates are out of school, they can only enter society and take up a new career. Although vocational training is not the responsibility of middle schools, the employment problem of these hundreds of thousands of middle school students cannot be ignored in the end. The training of middle schools, in terms of curriculum and conduct,

### Securities

Short covering and new long positions rise together, public bonds rise in a straight line.

Types C, D, and E each rise by more than one yuan.

Yesterday, the public bond market of the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was in a state of boiling enthusiasm, and the upward trend became more intense. The Xi'an Incident has turned into a settlement, and the market's excitement about absorption is extremely strong. Both short covering and new long positions are very enthusiastic. The chips on the table are scarce. Therefore, under the vigorous atmosphere, market prices rose more sharply. Unified bonds all moved towards the high price of interest-bearing prices of one month. According to the brilliance of the situation, and the exuberance of popularity, the future progress should be endless. However, because the straight-line rise is too fast, I am afraid that a moderate reversal will occur. The opening of the market yesterday morning showed people's high spirits, and those who turned from short to long were extremely enthusiastic. Huge amounts of 50 and 43 were absorbed, and market prices suddenly rose by two to three cents to half a dollar. The upward trend in the secondary market was very prosperous. 50 and 16 continued to be bought, and 72 and 44 gradually came out. Unified C and other types all rose by five cents to three corners. The trend of the opening of the market in the afternoon was even more rising. 50, 5, and 11 were bought wildly again, and 14 and 72 were still sold. However, because people's hearts were agitated, market prices rose again by one cent to four and a half cents. At the close, the absorption on the table was more prosperous. The purchase of 5, 315, and 50 continued to surge. Type C continued to rise by five cents to three and a half cents. Type A of this month was slightly lower by five cents. Throughout the day, the result was a surge of seven or eight cents to one, four cents and three cents. Type A of this month was only four and a half cents. The total number of transactions was 1.1 million yuan. The comparison of the rise and fall of the highest and lowest prices is shown in the table on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan):

### Piece Goods

Qingdao will auction off white cotton cloth.

Shanghai's inventory suddenly rose by a cent. The absorption of Shanghai goods on this street is still surging.

Yesterday, the trend of the cloth market was still good. The market rose more than it fell. In fact, the futures prices were high. Those who held the goods were at ease, and the silver and money industry accommodated mortgages. Domestic customers and colleagues on this street had a strong tendency to hoard. Qingdao will auction off white goods on February 18. The Huashang Huaxin Factory's Zhanqiao brand fine cloth will be the standard product, and the local Japanese-owned Gongda Factory's 12-pound Shuanglongzhu fine cloth will be designated as the same level. This method still uses the Japanese factory's Shuanglongzhu brand as the standard. The status of Japanese fine cloth in the Qingdao market far exceeds that of Chinese factories. It is heard that the Shanghai Japanese Yufeng Factory's Longtou fine cloth has been reduced by a cent, but the current selling price of Longtou in Shanghai often exceeds Shuanglongzhu by several cents to one cent, so there is a profit to be made, resulting in a sharp increase in the selling price of Qingdao goods in Shanghai (per piece) of one cent. Shanghai goods also rose due to the efforts of the dyeing factories on Hexing Street and the domestic help. Fine cloth increased by nine cents, 84 cloth increased by one cent, and fine twill was slightly firm, and the price was still stable. The customer sales of fine cloth from this factory have also turned around. Guangdong, Anhui, and this street all have a strong demand for about a hundred packages of flannel, broadcloth, and printed goods. This street and the domestic help are also actively searching for goods.

### Yarn and Cotton

January Delivery Amount and Its Process

Sino-Japanese War Gold Rooster Yarn for January was listed on August 1, 1936, at a price of 207.5 yuan. At that time, a certain party worked hard to go long and there was a period of rising. Later, due to good news about raw cotton and new cotton and sluggish yarn sales, the yarn inventory in the yarn and cloth warehouses increased sharply to more than 37,000 bales. The multiple parties had no intention of receiving goods, and the market price went from bad to worse. On September 2, it fell to a low of 196 yuan. Later, in the autumn, China's agricultural products were abundant, the purchasing power of villagers was strong, and the trade of cloth improved. The autumn sales developed, and the 30,000 bales of yarn in the yarn and cloth warehouse were sold out. Most of the yarn factories reduced production due to the shutdown of the machine repair in the summer, so the buying was more intense. The prosperity of the sales market was a new record in the five years since the leisure time. The market price rose sharply, and the highest peak was 256 yuan. Later, at the end of the year, the yarn sales were bleak, and the factory roots were loosened. A certain cotton company closed half of the large amount and opened the cash yarn to set out the target yarn, which fell to 245.4 yuan. Immediately after, the three-grade yarn was shorted and soared to 300 yuan. People's hearts were shaken, and there were many long-headed companies organized by Indian merchants, and then rebounded to more than 50 yuan. The final closing price was 253 yuan, which was 45.5 yuan higher than the opening price. The remaining to be delivered was 13,750 bales, which was 4,000 bales less than last month. The delivery price was calculated at the last three days and was 250 yuan, which was 13 yuan lower than last month. The delivered products included 10-count, 16-count, and 20-count yarns. There were a total of 5,600 bales of new goods, and the rest were self-delivered and received. The names and amounts of the brokers for the receiving and delivery parties are recorded separately as follows:

The target cotton for January was also launched on August 1, 1936, at a price of 41.1 yuan. At that time, in the era of old cotton, a certain visit organized a long-headed company and dragged in large quantities in July and August. The sound of squeezing air was sung into the clouds. The new cotton was pulled up by it, and on July 11, the peak reached 44 yuan. Then, on August 10, the China Cotton Industry Statistics Association announced that the estimated national cotton production reached more than 16 million dan, which was more than double the previous year. As a result, speculators flocked in and the market price plummeted, breaking the 40 yuan level. On September 2, it fell to 38 yuan. Later, due to the soaring yarn market, the cotton market, which was dependent on each other, was dragged into a good situation, and the highest peak reached 44 yuan again. The final closing price was 42.1 yuan, which was only 9 cents higher than the opening price. The remaining to be delivered was 41,500 dan, which was 22,800 dan less than last month. The delivery price was 42.5 yuan for the last two days, which was the same as last month. The delivered products included fire machine, Tonghua, Taicang, Hankou cotton, and Shashi cotton.

Suspension of yarn and cloth market for delivery

The spot yarn and cotton are doing more than 35,000 pieces and packages.

The Yarn Standard Yarn Cotton Market suspended the meeting due to the delivery matters at the end of this month, but the current yarn merchants still went to the meeting to do business. Customers mostly ended their business due to the approaching period of the final accounts, and the business decreased. However, the price was firm due to the squeeze of the target yarn, and the hearts of the people were stable. The buyers from all gangs counted 567 packages, and the selling price rose by about 5 cents to 1 yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below:

Guangdong 107 Shantou 15 Inland 433 Ningbo 7 Wuhu 5 Total 567

The cotton market is stable. Because the overseas cotton industry is turning to high flying, and the flood in the United States is serious, and the cotton field area is suffering from the disease is expanding, people's hearts are shaken. Indian cotton has also rebounded. As for the development of the current sales factory stomach, Yufeng factory has exclusively done more than 2,000 pieces, with a source of 1,280 packages of Yaohua and 1,398 packages of Tonghua.

Lingbao Cotton 62.75 Yufeng Factory entered 267 pieces of spot goods sent to the factory Cizhou Cotton 5715 and another 1,000 pieces and another Talisi 57.25 and another 1,000 pieces and another Zhengzhou Chemical 66.25 and another 300 pieces and another Laohekou 45.25 and another 655 pieces and another

The flood continues and American cotton people's hearts tend to buy.

Yesterday, the American cotton market opened, and the market was active and firm. The price was due to good news from Liverpool, the flood continued, and the pledged cotton would not be sold off in large quantities. Fellow brokers and foreign merchants actively bought in, and the prices of each month rose by 2 to 9 pounds. People's hearts tended to buy, and the trend in the market was extremely firm. Although the rise in market prices caused a large number of long positions to close and hedge sales, they were all absorbed by buyers. Spot goods were firm and expensive, and there were not many sellers. People in the industry are waiting for the progress of the flood. According to Meng Feisi's report, the situation in the area has eased, but the insurance company is still working hard to transport cotton to higher ground. Later, the long positions closed, and part of them reacted. At the close, the industry bought in the near month, and the market was firm. It is estimated that spot goods rose by 8 pounds, and futures rose from no change to 8 pounds. British cotton rose by 15 points, and futures rose by 10 to 11 points. Indian cotton rose initially due to the American flood and exporters buying in, and then returned due to long positions taking profits, but then became firm again due to powerful Liverpool telecommunications. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 4.25 to 5 robes, Omra rose by 3 to 3.25 robes, and Bailuoxi rose by 2.75 to 3 robes. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 28th):

American cotton compared to the previous day's legal currency British cotton compared to the previous day's legal currency 3360 rose 848.30 current 138 rose 15 55.10 53.605 47.60 1715 213.60 13.00 flat 45.303 732 53.40 73.45 347.00 2713 213.50 122.97 flat 45.20 4710 105330 1296 flat 45.10 5709 1013.3 current 13.30 rose 849.80 flat Pingguoer 183.10 rose 5.00 32.70 May period 182.00 4.25 31.40 Omra 209.00 3.00 38.10 May period 209.75 3.25 48.20 Bailuoxi 139.00 3.00 41.00 July August period 131.50 2.75 41.40

According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast on the 29th was 228.5 robes for Bailuoxi, 208.5 robes for Omra, and 183 robes for Pingguoer, all down by half a robe.

Attached is the weekend statistics of Egyptian cotton on the left (unit 1,000 cantars):

Suspension of the three-grade market and rise in spot yarn.

### Grain

Flour and wheat fall step by step.

The price of foreign wheat continues to fall. Domestic actual sales have also decreased sharply.

At the opening of the flour market, the price of flour in each month showed a gradual and miserable decline. Because the price of foreign wheat was still not good, such as Chicago falling by 12 cents, Canada falling by nearly 5 cents, far falling by 42 cents, and Liverpool falling by 12 pence. Therefore, people's hearts were already soft when the price was opened, and some of the long positions could no longer be abandoned, resulting in a drop of 23 cents when the price was opened. Later, it was reported that the factory had continued to order 3,000 to 4,000 tons of foreign wheat the day before yesterday, at a price of 8 yuan and 7 corners. Therefore, people's hearts were even more empty, and the price was strong. Until the opening of the market in the afternoon, the price of February was initially opened from small to 8 corners and 7 cents. Then, the long positions outside the industry were unwilling to give up the idea of speculation, and wanted to hold on to it, so the trading turned weak, and the market was also in a stable situation. The external environment has also changed, such as the inability of domestic consumption to be smooth, and the future seems difficult to hold on.

Highest Lowest Yesterday Closing Day Comparison February 3.9125 3.8700 3.8950 down 0.0423 March 3.9800 3.9375 3.9450 0.0525 April 3.9800 3.9625 4.9850 0.0525

After the opening of the wheat market, the prices of each month fell sharply. Because the price of foreign wheat continued to fall, and in terms of the trend, those who hoarded last year were seeking to sell due to the improvement of the international situation. As far as the domestic situation is concerned, after the market reached its peak, actual sales decreased sharply. The so-called extreme things turn against each other, and it happened to be the right time. Therefore, the opening price saw a big drop, a drop of 68 cents to 11 cents. Until the opening of the market in the afternoon, the situation in February was even more lax. The opening price in March and April fell by 35 cents compared to the morning. Then, the flour market returned to stability, and there were also floating empty positions to make up for it, which was 37 cents higher than the initial opening. Looking at the overall situation, if foreign wheat continues to be determined, I am afraid that this year's situation will be in inverse proportion to last year. Because the settlement is approaching, the merchants lack goods, so there is no official delivery.

Highest Lowest Yesterday Closing Comparison February 6.28 6.29 6.31 down 0.12 March 6.48 6.4 6.48 0.09 April 6.49 6.45 6.48 0.10 June 5.25 5.24 5.24 0.06

### He Xia Rice Market South Rise North Fall

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of each gang was about 40 lots (8,600 to 700 stones of goods in total). The sales market of thin rice Nos. 11 and 12 in this street was turning weak, but the buns were still moving. It is estimated that the Tianjin and Qingdao gangs handled nearly 2,000 packages of thin rice, so the market for thin rice continued to rise by one corner or so. The thick japonica was stable, the sheep-tipped was slightly tight, the Du-tipped was short of goods, and the price was increased by a corner or so. The Yinbian Yuan had no rise or fall.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of the He Xia gangs was slightly strong, about 40 lots. The sales of each cargo on the market were very light. White japonica returned slightly by about one corner, early rice followed slightly by 78 cents, thin rice was slightly nearly one corner, Yangdu Port tipped price was slightly 25 cents, the guest-tipped was flat and tired, and the Baiyuan was a small number of points. The remaining goods were all in a soft trend.

Guest Xian Cantonese sales are still smooth.

Vendors and hoarders are eager to sell, and market prices are difficult to rebound.

Yesterday, the Cantonese gang's handling of stomachs was active again. The city handled more than 4,000 packages of machine-hulled rice, but the sales in this street were weak again, and the oil building still had social events, so the market showed a tired surface and recovered. However, in recent days, the arrivals have been endless, with 7,000 to 8,000 packages to more than 10,000 packages every day. Peddlers and guest hoarders all plan to sell with the market, so the market price is ultimately difficult to rebound. More than 8,600 packages were opened throughout the day, asking for 6,235 packages of Jiangxi rice, 1,500 packages of Hanzzao, 540 packages of Wentaiyong rice, and 350 packages of Xiangnan rice. In the later market, with the end of the year approaching, there will be no major rise or fall. However, the demand for rice in Guangdong Province is very urgent, and the purchase is also poor, but due to insufficient ship positions, it has not been able to be fully enjoyed.

Japanese banks took advantage of the high prices to supply the market, and the market was still strong. Then banks did business with each other. The process for future terms was sluggish.

### Silk and Tea

Foreign Firms' Silk Market Still Difficult to Recover

For more than ten days, the domestic and foreign silk markets have been declining. As of yesterday, New York finally rebounded. The exchange traded 4,410 bales, and the silk price for both spot and futures increased by 2.5 to 3.5 cents. The Yokohama silk market was also firm yesterday, with the spot price rising by 13 yuan and the futures price rising by 12 yuan. The market sentiment seemed to stabilize. The Lyon silk market, the Shanghai silk market, and Guangdong silk all remained at the original price, while Japanese silk fell slightly by 0.25 francs. The local silk market for foreign firms was still difficult to recover. If the prices of Japanese and American silk could rise considerably again, the bid and ask prices for both sides could gradually converge. Yesterday, only users made sporadic purchases of white filature silk. Foreign firms' silk was still less active than Indian firms. A total of 38 bales were traded.

### Sugar Market

Over a Thousand Bags of Newly Arrived Sliced Raw Sugar Expected to be Traded

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was still soft. The guild's pricing for 24 raw sugar white spot goods was slightly better the day before, but weakened again yesterday, quoted at 23 yuan. The re-export price was 0.05 less, at 7.55 yuan. Dong Bai also fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Spot No. 4 was 23.1 yuan, and the re-export price was 8 yuan, both down by 0.15 yuan. Spot No. 8 was 22.6 yuan, down by 0.2 yuan, and the re-export price was 7.7 yuan, down by 0.15 yuan. No. 5 YRO mark was 22.35 yuan, and the re-export price was 7.4 yuan, both down by 0.1 yuan. The local factory's refined white Zhenji No. 1 was 22.1 yuan, and Jin Xin Da Hua No. 1 was 22.2 yuan, with no changes in the prices. It was heard that the sliced raw sugar newly arrived by the Qing Yuan ship from Guangdong and Hong Kong yesterday had not yet been released. It was secretly expected that several thousand bags would be traded at a cheaper price. However, according to the Shantou telegram, due to the lack of Chaoqing arrivals and inventory, the production price was tight, and brown sugar also rose slightly. The Jianbang's previous inventory of raw raw sugar was still being hoarded.

### North-South Goods

Orchid Seeds Still Insufficient Supply

The orchid seeds continued to arrive slightly yesterday. Because only a small number of shipments arrived on successive ships, the supply was insufficient, especially for high-quality goods. Therefore, the market situation was still tight. The goods that arrived yesterday could probably be sampled today. If the goods are yellow and bright, the price could be further increased.

### Metals

100-Pound American Double-Strand Iron Extremely Quiet, Thinking of Action

Recently, oil companies, printing factories, and egg factories have been competing to purchase 100-pound American double-strand iron. Therefore, the market situation has suddenly become lively, and the selling price has been rising steadily. Currently, the top-grade goods on the market are sold at 50 yuan per box, the second-grade goods are 48 yuan, and the third-grade goods are 47.5 yuan. It was found that more than 400 boxes were sold yesterday.

### Ribbed Steel Bar Prices High, Sales Stagnant

Since the overseas price of ribbed steel bars has soared, the local market price has also risen sharply. The standard price has gradually increased from 120 yuan to 180 yuan. Recently, the overseas price has been quoted at £9 19s, an increase of more than £4 10s compared to before. Therefore, the Shanghai market sentiment is surprisingly strong. However, due to the approaching of the Lunar New Year and the excessive price increases by industry colleagues, buyers are watching and hesitating. Therefore, the market transaction has stagnated. Only factories have sporadic transactions, with only slight releases. It was found that the price the day before yesterday was between 175 yuan and 180 yuan, with an estimated 40 to 50 tons sold by hardware stores along North Suzhou Road.

### Special Cash Guarantee System and the Spirit of the Times

— Pan Wen'an Jin Muyao

The establishment of banks in our country began in the late Qing Dynasty. In the past thirty years, although the leaders and administrative authorities have been determined to improve and expand them, they have been constrained by the environment, natural disasters, and man-made disasters, which have prevented them from achieving peace. As a result, even today, there are still many things that need to be improved, which cannot be denied. For example, business policies and investment channels all have shortcomings that can be criticized. This is a major issue, so let's set it aside for now. As for the personnel guarantee system, it is a problem that bank authorities and employees alike find difficult to handle. As the saying goes, "When things reach an extreme, they change; change leads to progress." This is certainly not an empty phrase. In recent years, proposals for reforming the personnel guarantee system, such as "credit guarantee" and "special cash guarantee methods," have emerged frequently, and the latter is particularly novel and adapted to the trends of the times. This system was planned by Mr. Tang Shoumin, the general manager of the Bank of Communications, and Mr. Wang Weiyin, the secretary and personnel section chief of the bank. It has been repeatedly discussed and studied by the Shanghai Banking Association and the Banking Society, and it is considered to be feasible. Recently, it has been widely criticized in order to achieve perfection (the original text was published in the Shen Bao on January 27). In the midst of the clamor for reforming the guarantee system, this is a problem with great research value. Therefore, I would like to express my humble opinions to correct the current sages:

The basic spirit of the "Special Cash Guarantee Method" lies in the joint and several responsibility between the bank and its employees. The general plan is to use the deposit of three types of guarantee deposits, A, B, and C, as material guarantees, and to use the strict imposition of joint and several responsibility as a spiritual guarantee. The method is as follows: ㊀ When an employee joins, they shall pay a "Type A guarantee deposit" equal to three times their monthly salary, which shall be stored by the bank and paid interest at a weekly rate of 1.2%. When resigning, if the employee has not committed any fraud or has not been jointly punished due to the fraud of a colleague, the entire principal and half of the interest shall be returned; the remaining half of the interest shall be allocated by the bank to the "Employee Guarantee Reserve." ㊁ Employees shall pay a "Type B guarantee deposit" equal to 2% of their monthly salary, which shall be stored by the bank and paid interest at a weekly rate of 1.2%. When resigning, if the employee has not committed any fraud or embezzlement, they shall be reimbursed after deducting the amount of proportional compensation due to the fraud of a colleague. ㊂ Each year, the bank shall allocate several tens of thousands of yuan for a "Type C guarantee deposit," which shall be stored in a special account and paid interest at a weekly rate of 1.2%. The bank shall also establish an "Employee Guarantee Deposit Account," and at the end of each year, it shall deposit ㊀ half of the interest from the Type A guarantee deposit, ㊁ the principal and interest from the Type B guarantee deposit, and ㊂ the principal and interest from the Type C guarantee deposit into the account to serve as a "Guarantee Reserve." In the event of an employee committing fraud or embezzlement, in addition to confiscating their Type A guarantee deposit and half of the interest and sealing up their property in accordance with the law, the reserve can be used to make up for the loss. The accumulation of small amounts can add up to a large sum, which must be sufficient for use. At the same time, it is strictly stipulated that employees who are jointly or severally responsible for handling the job with the employee who committed the fraud in the same branch, and the direct supervisors of the same branch, shall be subject to joint and several punishment. This is the general outline of the system.

In the 20th century, with the high development of industry, the division of labor has become more detailed, transactions have become more frequent, and the degree of mutual dependence among members of society has deepened. A person who produces a certain commodity or a certain part of a commodity must cooperate with those who produce other commodities or other parts of a commodity, and exchange or coordinate with each other in order to obtain the necessities of life, or to make the whole commodity generate value. As a result, members of society must divide and cooperate in all aspects of life activities, and everyone makes individual contributions to promote the entire social organization. The evolution of this production system will inevitably affect the social ideology. Therefore, the laissez-faire policy and individualism that were popular in the 19th century, whose purpose was to remove the shackles of feudal forces in the Middle Ages in order to promote industrial productivity, can no longer represent the current social trend of interconnected relationships. As a result, Western celebrities such as Diguit, Laski, and Spann came out to create the theories of "Social Solidarity" and "Collectivism" (or "Totalitarianism"), clarifying the theory that the molecules of society must be mutually responsible and closely cooperate. All activities must be based on the premise of taking care of the interests of the whole society. All those who cooperate with others to promote the welfare of the masses are good; those who act on their own and disregard the masses are evil. If A has a fault, the entire society must be responsible; if B makes a contribution, it is the result of cooperation of the entire society. Therefore, our obedience to the laws and regulations of the government is not subject to the threats of divine or royal power, but because we recognize that these laws and regulations help the cooperation of society and conform to the principles of interconnected relationships. Therefore, we must obey them to form a close-knit organization. This spirit can be seen everywhere in modern progressive society. The most popular in our country are cooperatives and the Baojia system, etc., and the "Special Cash Guarantee Method" is also one of the systems that adapt to this spirit of the times.

Although the forms of cooperatives can be distinguished into production cooperatives, marketing cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, and lending cooperatives, etc., their basic principles are inseparable from the direct activities of each member to achieve the same goal. The successes and failures are shared by each member, and not manipulated by a third party. This principle is most obvious in lending cooperatives; members borrow money and are jointly and severally guaranteed by all members. The power of the whole is used to promote the soundness of individual members. Therefore, the actions of one member must be supervised by all members; otherwise, other members will have to bear the consequences and be jointly liable for compensation. The same is true for the Baojia system. The residents of one Bao and one Jia mutually guarantee that they will not do anything wrong. If something improper happens, the residents of the same Bao and same Jia, except for those that are truly difficult to discover in advance, shall be subject to joint and several punishment. Therefore, they must be closely supervised and carefully prevented from the slightest hint of impropriety at ordinary times, and any impropriety must be reported. If implemented properly, it can indeed make the neighborhood peaceful and the community quiet. The above two points have been designated by the National Government as important policies for reviving the rural economy and preparing for local autonomy. The essence of it is to adopt the principles of joint and several liability.

The reason why the "Special Cash Guarantee Method" is superior to the guarantor system and credit insurance is that it adopts the spirit of joint and several liability and adapts to the trend of the times. At the beginning of an employee's employment, they must pay a "Type A guarantee deposit" equal to three times their monthly salary; and then they must deduct a "Type B guarantee deposit" equal to 2% of their monthly salary. If someone in the same office commits fraud or embezzles public funds, the half of the interest on the "Type A guarantee deposit" and the full amount of the principal and interest on the "Type B guarantee deposit" of all employees may be withdrawn to make up for the loss. This method of joint and several compensation is sufficient to arouse mutual concern among colleagues and generate a sense of shared destiny, one. After a fraud occurs, the employees who jointly or severally handle the job in the same branch as the employee who committed the fraud, and the direct supervisors of the same branch, shall be subject to joint and several punishment; this is sufficient to urge the employees who handle affairs together to carefully review and thoroughly examine the matters handled by others, two.

The old-fashioned guarantor system has many defects, which need not be repeated. And allowing employees to find their own guarantors, without linking them together, and the guarantors have little opportunity to supervise the behavior of the guaranteed employees, this old method with a strong individualistic color cannot adapt to a society with a detailed division of labor and frequent cooperation. In the future, it will inevitably be replaced by a new system of joint and several liability, without any doubt. Because the author believes that the abandonment of the old system cannot be delayed, and the reason why the new system must be adopted by society is that it has a foundation in the spirit of the times; therefore, I am happy to express it. (End)

### Philippine President Quezon Went to the United States Yesterday

The National Government specially presented the Grand Cordon Order of Brilliant Jade; Quezon thanked and congratulated China and the Philippines for their close ties

Philippine President Quezon arrived in Shanghai on the 28th at noon by the Changxing Shipping Company's Empress of Canada ship and was warmly welcomed by our side. Quezon was eager to go to the United States, so he left Shanghai by the original ship at 9:30 AM yesterday morning. In order to promote the relationship between China and the Philippines, our National Government specially sent Mayor Wu as a representative to present the Grand Cordon Order of Brilliant Jade on the afternoon of the 28th. The details of the situation are as follows:

The National Government presented a noble medal; in order to promote the relationship between China and the Philippines, the National Government specially sent Mayor Wu Tiecheng as a representative to present Quezon with the Grand Cordon Order of Brilliant Jade, which is the highest noble medal that our country presents to foreign heads of state. The presentation ceremony was held at Mayor Wu's private residence on Haig Road at 5:00 PM on the 28th, after the grand tea party jointly held by Vice President Kong and Mayor Wu to welcome Quezon. Ambassadors, ministers, and consuls-general of various countries in Shanghai participated. Mayor Wu Tiecheng delivered a speech on behalf of the National Government, saying that he was presenting Philippine President Quezon with the Grand Cordon Order of Brilliant Jade on behalf of the National Government to express our country's very friendly intentions towards the Philippines and to wish the relationship between China and the Philippines increasingly close. After Mayor Wu finished his speech, he respectfully presented the medal to Quezon. After Quezon received the medal, he gave a reply, saying that he was very honored and grateful to receive the Grand Cordon Order of Brilliant Jade presented by the Chinese National Government, but in accordance with the Philippine Constitution, the President cannot accept a medal from another country before the Congress approves it. Therefore, he can only receive it today and cannot wear it, but he dares to believe that the Philippine Congress will definitely pass this matter when it convenes. As for the relationship between China and the Philippines, it has always been very close. The Philippines had already traded with China before it traded with other countries. Moreover, there are many Chinese people in the Philippines, and there is a clear and close relationship in commerce and finance. Therefore, we wish the relationship between China and the Philippines will become closer and closer.

Yesterday morning, all walks of life in Shanghai saw him off; Quezon and his party landed at noon on the 28th. It was originally scheduled to return to the original ship at 11:00 PM that night. Due to busy socializing, they stayed overnight at the Hua Mao Hotel that night. They went to the Gonghexiang Wharf at about 8:00 AM yesterday morning to return to the original ship. Mayor Wu, Zhou Jue, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, and the US Consul-General in Shanghai Goss, etc., all went to the wharf to see them off. The ship set sail eastward at 9:30 AM.

Quezon's wife will pass through Shanghai next month; Quezon's wife originally planned to go to the United States with him, but the Catholic Congress is scheduled to be held in Manila on February 3rd, and Mrs. Quezon must represent Quezon to receive the Catholic friends. She did not have time to go with him, so she changed her plan to go to the United States by the Changxing Shipping Company's Empress of Japan from the Philippines on February 20th, and she is scheduled to pass through Shanghai on the 25th. After Mrs. Quezon arrives in the United States, she will accompany Quezon to England to attend the coronation ceremony of the new British monarch after Quezon finishes his official business in the United States.

### Achievements in Salt Administration Rectification in the 25th Year

Tax Revenue Exceeds 200 Million, a Fourfold Increase Compared to the 17th Year of the Republic; Progress Seen in Construction Projects and Improvement Efforts

The progress and effectiveness of our country's salt administration work last year have been of great concern to the public. It is learned that the preliminary annual report of the Salt Revenue Audit Office for the 25th year has been completed. Therefore, we urgently explored and recorded it as follows:

Total Salt Tax Revenue According to the preliminary statistical reports from various regions, the total salt tax revenue for this year has exceeded 200 million yuan. In the 17th year of the Republic, before this office was restored, the salt tax revenue was only 54 million yuan, less than a decade ago, it has increased more than fourfold. (In the past eight years, tax revenues have been increasing steadily: 61,071,000 yuan in the 18th year, 104,581,000 yuan in the 19th year, 134,228,000 yuan in the 20th year, 142,185,000 yuan in the 21st year, 159,247,000 yuan in the 22nd year, 177,461,000 yuan in the 23rd year, 185,446,000 yuan in the 24th year, and 205,433,000 yuan in the 25th year.) The sharp increase in tax revenue last year was mainly due to the good harvests and the relatively stable situation, but the rectification of the salt administration itself was the main reason. Important reform measures last year included the acceleration of construction of salt field projects, the strict rectification of anti-smuggling efforts, the abolition of contractors, the consolidation of tax rates, the continued improvement of the salt administration organization, and the thorough elimination of malpractices by officials and merchants, all of which directly and indirectly contributed to increased tax revenue. As for the implementation of the new measurement system, although the salt tax has been raised invisibly (but there have also been reductions in several places), the transportation and sales of salt are also greatly affected by the law of diminishing returns in economics. The higher the tax rate, the more expensive the salt price. Most ordinary people are poor, and their purchasing power will inevitably be weaker. Furthermore, with the increase in tax rates, smuggling will inevitably become more rampant, which the original anti-smuggling equipment cannot cope with. In addition, unscrupulous merchants take the opportunity to manipulate and profit from the tax increase. Therefore, as soon as the salt tax rate is increased, official sales will temporarily decrease sharply. Historically, it has been reviewed that in the last seasons of dynasties, salt taxes were often increased, but as a result, tax revenues were greatly reduced. This is clear evidence. Since the implementation of the new measurement system in the 23rd year, the number of official salt sales has been slightly less, but because the salt administration organization is sound, the original tax revenue has not only not decreased due to excessive tax increases, but has also made considerable progress, which is rare and valuable. Moreover, in order to cope with the rise of high-tax barriers, anti-smuggling efforts have been greatly rectified. Therefore, the sales volume reduced due to the tax increase in recent years has gradually recovered. The important matters held in this year are summarized as follows:

Merger of Agencies Since the Salt Revenue Audit Office took over the administrative affairs of the salt administration in the 21st year, the salt administration agencies in various regions have been successively merged over the years, saving a total of more than 4 million yuan in expenses each year. In May of this year, the position of Vice Commissioner of Huainan Transportation was abolished, and the Yangzhou Branch was changed to a sub-branch, and the Huaibei Branch was changed to the Lianghuai Branch to control the salt affairs of Lianghuai. In July, the position of Vice Commissioner of Northern Sichuan Transportation was abolished, and the Northern Sichuan Branch and the Chongqing Audit Office were changed to sub-branches. The original Southern Sichuan Branch was changed to the Sichuan Branch to control the salt affairs of Sichuan. In October, the position of Governor of Guangdong and Guangxi Transportation was changed to be concurrently held by the manager of the Guangdong and Guangxi Audit Office, saving more than 600,000 yuan in expenses each year. In addition, the salt fields in the Sichuan region were scattered and also merged in October of this year to facilitate centralized management. At present, except for Shanxi and Yunnan, the administrative and anti-smuggling affairs of salt affairs in various regions are all under the jurisdiction of the Audit Office. The responsibilities are complete, and the powers are consistent. Therefore, the salt administration has entered a new class, and there is an atmosphere of clarity and development. This organizational spirit is in line with the salt affairs agency organization passed by the Legislative Yuan in July of the 25th year.

New Construction in Salt Field Areas The construction of salt fields in the three regions of Changlu, Huaibei, and Guangdong, such as salt storage warehouses, tax police barracks, surrounding field roads, salt transportation rivers, and telephone networks, has been mostly completed. The newly produced salt is returned to the warehouse on time, and private salt taxes are reduced. This year, the construction of salt field projects in the regions of Min, Lu, Zhe, Huai, and Lu is still being actively carried out according to the previously determined plan. The total budget for the whole year's projects, excluding the three regions of Sichuan, Guangdong, and Hedong, reached 6,501,780 yuan. Last year, the Dongzhuang breach caused the Yellow River to flood south, and the Huaibei area became a swamp. In order to protect the salt fields and maintain the livelihood of the people, the Ministry of Finance approved an appropriation of more than 600,000 yuan to the Lianghuai Construction Committee, together with the National Economic Council and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, to dredge the Shanhou Cenchi Junzhou and Sanhe separately to drain the downstream to avoid flooding. The project, which is 46 kilometers long, was completed this year.

Gradual Balancing of Tax Rates The salt tax rates in various regions were previously vastly different, and were not uniform. In recent years, they have been reorganized and gradually balanced. This year, the tax rates in Sichuan and the four banks of the Yangtze River have been reorganized. The tax rates in the Sichuan region originally had more than ten kinds. They were revised in March and December to simplify them. The light tax near the fields of Liangzhe, the Zhejiang salt tax of Shangnanchuan, the Yue salt tax of Xiangnan, the shoulder-carrying river of Yuantan Sanhejian, the Huai salt tax of Yunhe, the Huai salt tax of Jiangxi Jianchang Zhuanan, and the Mengqing Shi salt tax of the Northwest region have also been reorganized to meet the main purpose of simplicity and uniformity.

Promoting the Free System The evils of the monopoly system in our country are rampant, and the Salt Law promulgated in the 20th year of the Republic also first raised the purpose of free trade. In recent years, the monopoly of salt sales in the four counties of Lintan Fei Yi in Shandong, and the exclusive sale of Yingan in Sichuan Furong, as well as eighteen counties including Yongjia in Liangzhe, eighteen counties including Shangyou Nanping in Fujian, thirty-one cities and counties including Shantou in Liangguang, and the original contractors in Gansu have been abolished one after another, allowing scattered merchants to freely report and transport. Nanjing has also been designated as a free sales area for Huainan Northern Field Salt and refined salt, beyond the sales area of Huainan food bank exclusive merchants. This year, seven counties including Minhou in Fujian, seven counties including Enping in Guangdong, and one county in Zhongshan were all changed to free trade to lead the way for the implementation of the new Salt Law.

Adjusting Production, Transportation, and Sales The salt needed in various regions is supplied by a fixed production area before the Yin'an system is abolished. However, this system needs to be adjusted at any time due to changes in production and sales conditions and other situations. For example, the western part of Guanzhong in Shaanxi Province has always been a Gansu salt sales area. In September of this year, due to the obstruction of transportation roads, Gansu salt was out of stock, and the people were in danger of eating tasteless food. It was approved to borrow Lu salt to meet the emergency needs. The same situation occurred in the Sichuan and Hunan regions in June of this year. Efforts were made to adjust them separately, and both the interests of the production area and the sales area were taken into consideration. In addition, in order to adjust production and sales, prevent salt shortages, and balance salt prices, Changping salt was continued to be operated in Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Zhejiang, Fujian and other provinces and cities. In addition, the establishment of warehouses for storing salt in various provinces and regions is being actively prepared.

Rectifying Anti-Smuggling Affairs The most important rectification of anti-smuggling affairs this year is the area of Sichuan, Guangdong, and Liangzhe. The anti-smuggling administration of Sichuan and Guangdong was extremely lax. Since the administrative affairs of each region were merged and managed by the Audit Office, the anti-smuggling police force was completely reorganized at the same time, and capable police officers from other regions were transferred to carry out practical rectification. The salt fields in Liangzhe are scattered and easy to smuggle. Before the completion of the salt field encirclement project, a special inspection police force was added to be stationed in each important field to check the salt production work and quantity, and strictly prevent private leaks.

Eliminating Nitrate Salt The production of nitrate salt is most prevalent in Hebei and Henan provinces, followed by Shandong Province. There are also four counties in Xuzhou in Jiangsu Province. The quality is poor and the price is cheap, and private sales are extremely rampant. A committee for improving alkaline land was established in Hebei Province to implement a plan to improve the soil, using various methods such as digging wells, opening canals, releasing silt, turning the soil, deep plowing, ridge cultivation, and fertilization, and providing loans for planting and promoting the planting of American cotton. It is estimated that the amount of loans issued this year is about 55,000 yuan, and the amount of seeds issued is about 182,000 catties. The production of private nitrate salt has gradually decreased. The salt tax revenue this year has increased by about 4 million yuan compared with the 23rd year. Henan Province has also established a committee for organizing waterways and improving the soil, opening and closing rivers and canals, and revitalizing water conservancy. The rivers and canals dredged this year are 536 kilometers long. The counties in Jiangsu and Shandong provinces that produce local salt are also imitating the methods of improving the soil.

Managing Gypsum Salt Gypsum salt is a by-product of gypsum salt. Yingcheng County in Hubei Province is the most abundant, and Xiangtan County in Hunan Province also has it. In the past, only the local government levied business tax, and the production, transportation, and sales were not managed by the salt affairs agency in accordance with the law, resulting in the impact of the salt everywhere and harming the national tax. The Ministry of Finance suggested that the internal salt affairs agency take over the management. It sent personnel to Hubei to negotiate with the Hubei Provincial Government and took over in June of this year. The Yingcheng Gypsum Salt Administration was established to implement management. The gypsum salt in Hunan Province was also transferred by the Hunan Provincial Government to the Xiang'an Audit Office for takeover, and management methods were stipulated.

Foreign Debt Has Been Repaid All foreign debts guaranteed by salt tax were repaid on schedule this year in accordance with the methods set by the Ministry of Finance. The principal and interest of the debts repaid are listed below: ㊀ Huguang Railway Syndicate Loan: £141,450, 7 shillings and 1 pence, equivalent to 2,291,597.27 yuan in national currency, and £65, 10 shillings, equivalent to 1,040.13 yuan in national currency. ㊁ Crisp Syndicate Loan: £128,768, 14 shillings and 5 pence, equivalent to 3,401,119.42 yuan in national currency, and £212,555, 7 shillings and 11 pence, equivalent to 3,642,300.03 yuan in national currency. ㊂ British-French Syndicate Loan: £16,929, 17 shillings and 9 pence, equivalent to 268,869.33 yuan in national currency, and £267,743, 3 pence, equivalent to 4,422,282.96 yuan in national currency. ㊃ Marconi Company Syndicate Loan: £18,069, 1 shilling and 2 pence, equivalent to 300,541.30 yuan in national currency.

Preparing for the New Salt Law The main point of the new Salt Law is to levy taxes at the salt fields and allow people to buy and sell freely. Since its promulgation, although the implementation date has not been approved, this office should organize salt affairs in accordance with the established standards and actively prepare for implementation. However, the implementation of the new law must maintain the original tax revenue on the one hand, so that the national financial resources and the national treasury income will not be affected by the difficult meeting. On the other hand, under the current situation of rural bankruptcy and industrial and commercial depression, the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of salt people who will be eliminated as a result of free competition must also be taken into consideration for salt fields with higher costs. The monopoly system has been implemented for hundreds of years, and it has mutual relationships in national finance and social finance. Therefore, epoch-making reforms should be carefully planned to promote the greatest benefit. The steps for implementing the new law in this office over the years have depended on the promotion of national politics and finance. After careful consideration, it was decided to start with managing field production, improving salt quality, balancing tax rates, abolishing contractors, and organizing anti-smuggling and improving the functions of the salt administration organization. This office believes that the above-mentioned points have been actively carried out. After the completion of the work, the new Salt Law will be completed, and all of it will be promoted. This year, all regions have worked hard to promote the policies of this office, and its effectiveness is commendable.

Tax Revenue Comparison Table The salt tax revenue collected by each region this year is listed in the following table for comparison: Head Office: 677,000; Changlu: 27,674,000; Hedong: 4,620,000; Northern Jin: 1,320,000; Shaanxi: 1,792,000; Northern Sichuan: 1,741,000; Shandong: 11,302,000; Lianghuai: 41,420,000; Songjiang: 13,308,000; Liangzhe: 11,453,000; E'an: 15,027,000; Xiang'an: 15,257,000; Wan'an: 6,033,000; Xi'an: 7,277,000; Henan: 8,045,000; Yingcheng: 2000; Fujian: 4,329,000; Liangguang: 11,391,000; Yunnan: 1,651,000; Sichuan: 2,205,000; Total: 205,433,000 yuan. Explanation: ㊀ In addition to the salt tax, there are highway donations in Xi'an, river engineering donations in Changlu, operating expenses in Fujian, local surcharges in Guangdong and Yunnan, and organization fees in various regions. These are not included in the table, and are estimated to be about 8 million yuan per year. If all the numbers are listed together, the salt tax this year will increase by nearly 30 million yuan compared with last year. ㊁ The numbers listed in the table are based on the preliminary statistics of each region. After the accounts are audited, they will be corrected in the formal annual report.

### Zhejiang Local Bank Launched Industrial and Commercial Loans

A Trial Run Will Be Conducted in the Head Office Starting on February 1st; A Decision Will Be Made to Gradually Promote It After Achieving Results

Xin Sheng She reported that in order to support industry and commerce, the Zhejiang Local Bank has launched industrial and commercial loans, which will be started on February 1st. A trial run will be conducted in the head office first, and a decision will be made to gradually promote it after achieving results. The loans will be temporarily limited to seven industries, including electrical machinery silk weaving, silk weaving, machinery iron industry, silk industry, cloth industry, rice industry, and north-south goods industry. The loan regulations and introduction methods are recorded as follows:

Loan Regulations

㊀ In order to assist small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises in their operating funds and provide them with the opportunity to raise funds, the Bank will handle small-amount industrial and commercial loans. Small and medium-sized industrial and commercial factories and shops that have been established for more than two years and have joined the same industry association may apply for loans. ㊁ The loan amount for each household is limited to 200 to 1,000 yuan in national currency and is limited to use as industrial and commercial working capital. ㊂ Industrial and commercial factories and shops must be introduced by the same industry association, come to the Bank for face-to-face negotiation, and after being approved, an application form will be issued. The borrower must fill in the form truthfully and submit it to the Bank for review. If it is deemed qualified, the applicant factory or shop will be notified to come to the Bank to sign a loan agreement. ㊃ This loan must be guaranteed by two reputable factories or individuals approved by the Bank, and movable property may be used as collateral. Before the loan is repaid, if the Bank believes that the guarantor needs to be replaced, the borrower shall immediately find a new guarantor. ㊄ Each factory or shop may only borrow once at the same time, and the guarantor may only guarantee once and may not guarantee again or guarantee each other. ㊅ The term of this loan shall not exceed six months. The loan interest is divided into three types: lump-sum repayment upon maturity and installment repayment. If the principal and interest are not repaid upon maturity, the guarantor will be notified to repay immediately after the Bank's limited-term demand is ineffective (or the collateral will be disposed of, and if there is insufficient, the guarantor will still be fully responsible for repayment), and the right to protest and prior recourse will be waived. ㊆ The interest rate for this loan will be determined according to the local financial market conditions. ㊇ The actual operating situation of the industrial and commercial factories and shops that borrow money must be reported to the Bank in accordance with the prescribed date. ㊈ The Bank may send personnel to inspect the business situation and loan usage of the industrial and commercial factories and shops that borrow money at any time. If it is deemed unsafe or found to be inconsistent with the items filled in the application form, the Bank may recover all the loans from the guarantor without waiting for the maturity date. ㊉ If there are any matters not covered in these regulations, they may be revised at any time.

Introduction Methods

㊀ If various industrial and commercial industries need the Bank to lend small amounts of loans, the same industry association of each industry must formally discuss with the Bank and obtain the Bank's consent before the loans can be started for each industry. ㊁ The same industry association of each industry that has been agreed by the Bank to lend small amounts of loans must organize a special committee or designate a responsible department to handle the introduction matters. ㊂ Before the same industry association introduces industrial and commercial factories and shops to borrow money from the Bank, it must conduct a preliminary review of the content, loan usage, and repayment ability of each factory or shop. If it is deemed inappropriate, it will not be introduced. ㊃ If the loan introduced by a certain association is not handled in accordance with the contract provisions, or the agreement is breached upon maturity and the repayment is delayed, the association may not introduce other factories or shops. ㊄ The association shall be responsible for the loan it introduces until it is repaid. If it cannot be repaid upon maturity, the association shall assist the Bank in demanding payment and petition the local government and court to take administrative and legal actions against the borrowing factory or shop. ㊅ If there are any matters not covered in these measures, they may be revised at any time.

### Hong Shen, Fu Donghua and Others Convene a Forum of Literary and Art Figures

Initiate the Organization of the Chinese Literary and Art Association; Issue a Declaration on the Unified National Salvation Movement

Yesterday (the 29th), Hong Shen, Fu Donghua, Shao Xunmei, Gu Zhongyi, Hu Zhongchi, Ye Lingfeng, and six others invited literary and art writers from the city to hold a forum at the Jiu Lou of the Youth Association on Baxianqiao Road. Fu Yanchang, Jian Youwen, Wang Fuquan, Wang Tongzhao, Hu Huaichen, Shi Zhecun, Du Heng, Zhao Jiabi, Shen Qiping, Fan Zhongyun, Li Qingya, Gu Fengcheng, Yao Sufeng, Yedan, Ma Zihua, Zhou Renlin, Tao Kangde, Lu Shaofei, Liang Desuo, Lin Huiyin, Zhou Yuying, Xu Chi, Zhou Leshan, Zhang Menglin, Dai Wangshu, Wang Dingjiu, Ma Guoliang, Pan Zienong, Qian Taisheng, Gu Cangheng, Ni Yide, Zhu Manhua, Zhao Jingshen, Zhou Duo, Zhang Zhengfan, Huang Jingqi, Liu Xiangou, Yang Jinhao, Ji Xizong, Xu Beichen, Huang Xianggu, Zhang Daren, Wang Qixu, Tang Zengyang, Xu Suling, Chen Dongbai, and more than eighty others attended. Fang Zhi, Pan Gongzhan, and Hong Ruizhao were also invited to attend. First, Shao Xunmei reported on the significance of convening the forum, briefly stating that literature and art have an extremely important relationship with society and greatly affect the rise and fall of the nation. Therefore, today's forum is convened to discuss the following matters: 1. To initiate the organization of the Chinese Literary and Art Association to seek the great unity of all literary and art workers; 2. How to protect the interests of literary and art writers; 3. How literary and art writers, in this time of national crisis, should clearly identify their goals and work together. A draft of the "Declaration of the Shanghai Literary and Art Circles on the Unified National Salvation Movement" is submitted for your opinions. Next, Chuan Donghua added his views, briefly stating that according to the statistics of the publishing industry in 1936, the sales of literary and art books are declining. Therefore, we must first find ways to start a new literary renaissance movement. In the past, there have been several organizational bodies in the literary and art circles, but they were divided by factions, and unity was just empty talk. Therefore, we should seek a true unity movement. The necessary condition for a literary renaissance is social stability. The way to social stability is none other than unity. Today, the situation of unity has been roughly completed. We should cherish and consolidate it. Hong Shen briefly said that I once made an oath that if China launches a war of resistance against the enemy one day, if I personally do not sacrifice on the battlefield, then my personal words and deeds in this life will be false and deceitful. I believe that Chinese literary and art writers should seek unity with sincerity and jointly save this critically endangered country. Sacrificing the small self for the struggle of the nation and the country is the beginning of a revolutionary literary and art writer. I personally absolutely support the National Government and Chairman Chiang, who are fighting for peaceful unification and resisting foreign aggression to save the country today. In the process of national salvation, literary and art writers should completely abandon private grievances and unite to engage in the anti-Japanese national salvation movement. Jian Youwen briefly stated that, standing in the position of a writer, I fully agree with the "Declaration of the Shanghai Literary and Art Circles on the Unified National Salvation Movement" and have no objection. I especially agree with the organization of the Literary and Art Writers Association. In the past, the reason why writers could not unite was, first, the individualism of each writer; second, the egoism of each small group. To seek unity, we should change the habit of mutual contempt among scholars into mutual respect. Fan Zhongyun briefly said that Chinese scholars, since individualism has expanded and it is difficult to unite, have also been invaded by the ideology of imperial kingship, divided into various barriers, which is unfortunate. The greatness of our country's culture can be proved in history, not only unifying China, but also unifying various countries in the East. After the contact between China and the West, the differences in the ideological world are rare in the history of our country. For example, I was attacked by people a few years ago as a follower of nationalism, thinking that patriotism is ideological backwardness, but today everyone advocates patriotism, that is, the so-called leftists also advocate national defense literature. In a backward nation, ideological unity is indeed important. With the backwardness of our country's industry today, the promotion of the national cultural movement is even more urgent. Pan Zinong briefly said that I think two points should be added to the "Declaration of the Literary and Art Circles on the Unified National Salvation Movement": one is to resist aggression, and the other is to eliminate traitors. Wang Fuquan briefly stated that I have participated in the unity movement of the literary and art circles twice. The first time was before the September 18th Incident, and the second time was during the January 28th battle. The first participants disappeared after the meeting. The second participants, although they met several times, still had no results. The reason is that individualism is too strong. I think that only by overcoming individualism as much as possible, under the slogan of unified national salvation, can we seek true unity. Ma Zihua briefly said that under the anti-Japanese national salvation, no one can oppose the organization of literary and art groups. Then Xu Beichen and others expressed many opinions. The conveners asked Fang Xikong and Pan Gongzhan to express their opinions. Finally, the proposal was discussed: ㊀ The issue of revising the declaration, please Shao Xunmei, Hong Chen, Chuan Donghua, Ye Lingfeng, Hu Zhongchi, Gu Zhongyi, Fan Zhongyun, and seven others, revise it in accordance with the revision principles in the forum, and issue it in the name of all the participants. ㊁ The issue of organizing the Chinese Literary and Art Association, all the attendees are the initiators of the association, and Shao Xunmei, Hong Chen, Chuan Donghua, Li Qingya, Hu Zhongchi, Jian Youwen, Fan Zhongyun, Ye Lingfeng, Gu Zhongyi, Zhao Jingshen, Shen Qiyu, Wang Tongzhao, Yao Sufeng, Wang Fuquan, Zhou Hanmei, and fifteen others are appointed as preparatory committee members. The "Declaration of the Shanghai Literary and Art Circles on the Unified National Salvation Movement" is recorded as follows: We believe that literary and art works are the product of personal emotions, but individuals cannot exist independently of society, and emotions are determined by their surrounding environment. Therefore, to be honest, literary and art works cannot escape the limitations of time and space. Therefore, an era has the literature and art of an era, and a nation has the literature and art of a nation, each with its own unmistakable characteristics. The reason why literary and art works become the reflection of the times and the expression of national character lies here. We also know that literary and art works are the product of emotions and are different from scientific works that appeal to people's intellect. Literary and art works cannot be separated from the qualities of emotion, so they can arouse the resonance of readers, making people happy, angry, and sad, indignant, and unable to control themselves. Therefore, literary and art works, although are the expression of personal emotions, have broad social and national characteristics and can universally penetrate into the masses. Only in this way, in order to adapt to the urgent needs of our entire nation today, we feel that the literary and art circles must have a deep understanding of the direction of future efforts. In recent years, although foreign troubles have deepened and internal worries have not ended, there is one point that we can clearly see, that is, today's China is indeed very different from before. In the second half of last year alone, we resolutely rejected the enemy's demands and resolutely repelled the enemy's invasion. The reason why there was such a turning point was due to the rough completion of national unification. Therefore, if we want to thoroughly achieve the goal of national liberation, we must deeply recognize the great significance of national unification. However, if we want to achieve truly consolidated unity from the roughly completed unity, we still need our efforts. In other words, we must use the collective power of the entire nation to overcome all obstacles to national liberation. The separation of feudal warlords and the entanglement of international forces are enough to affect the unified situation that we have roughly completed. We must eliminate them with cultural forces. In the past history, the political unity of China relied entirely on huge cultural forces to maintain it. However, since the invasion of imperialist forces, our cultural circles also seem to be divided into some kind of barriers, which is contrary to the needs of the times and the nation. It is a very regrettable thing. Therefore, at present, for the grasp of the meaning of our national unity and national liberation, people in our literary and art circles bear a greater responsibility. We must make this demand for national unity penetrate into the hearts of every citizen, like the raging tide of the river and sea, surging and becoming a central driving force for the realization of national rejuvenation. No force can hinder it. "Unity determines everything." This is the common belief of the Chinese people today. We are willing to abide by this saying as a guide for future literary and art creation or the development of literary and art theories. (The names are listed in the list of attendees above) (January 29th)

### Chamber of Commerce Cables Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department to Release Detained Rice

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, due to the detention of rice purchased by Shanghai merchants in Yueqing and Pingyang counties of Zhejiang Province, specially cabled the Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department to release it. The cable stated: To the Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department, on the 28th of this month, the Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Trade Association sent a letter stating that, according to a joint letter from the trade members Qianfeng Yu Dehao, etc., in view of the insufficient supply of rice in the city, they specially ordered rice from Yueqing and Pingyang from Zhaochunji Grain Store in Yongjia County in November of last year, a total of 9,700 bags, and agreed to ship it to Shanghai in succession within the year. They had previously sent a letter to your association to forward a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to fill out a certificate and submit it to the Zhejiang Provincial Civil Affairs Department to allow Yueqing and Pingyang counties to release it. Now, according to a letter from Zhaochunji Grain Store, the county magistrates of the two counties are still unwilling to issue transportation permits, so the stored rice has not yet been shipped to Shanghai. After investigation, the rice has been ordered for more than two months, and the period of the great conclusion is approaching in an instant. Not only is rice in urgent need of supply, but the financial situation is urgent, and the members, etc., can hardly bear the losses any longer. Moreover, the Civil Affairs Department has already approved the case, and the county magistrates of the two counties deliberately make things difficult, which is unreasonable. In desperation, we specially send a letter to your association to ask the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to quickly cable the Zhejiang Provincial Civil Affairs Department to order Yueqing and Pingyang counties to issue permits for release. In order to maintain the food supply for Shanghai citizens and to facilitate commercial transportation, etc., to the meeting. After investigation, the Provisional Regulations for Food Regulation promulgated by the Executive Yuan state that food should be allowed to circulate freely within the national territory, and all provinces and cities should immediately stop the prohibition of transportation. Yueqing and Pingyang counties are also in the list of the Yuan Decree that is said to stop the prohibition of transportation. The 9,700 bags of rice purchased by Qianfeng Yu Dehao, etc., have been certified by a legal organization as being necessary for domestic civilian food, and should be allowed to circulate freely. However, the county magistrates of Pingle and other two counties still do not issue transportation bodies, which makes the temporary method of rice and grain regulation equal to a fictitious setting. If this is the case, where is the authority of the government orders, and what basis will the merchants have? It is reasonable to report the situation and cable your department to review it, and quickly transfer the order to release it, which is the most anticipated. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce respectfully, thrift.

### Celebration Committee Urges Landlords to Pay Donations

All district landlords who have not paid the donation and receipts should expedite the process three days in advance to clear the formalities. In addition, the Celebration Committee will commend the groups and individuals in the city who donated for the sake of raising funds. The names of the groups or the names of the individuals who donated more than 100 yuan have been submitted to the Municipal Government for rewards in order to promote encouragement.

### Special Cash Guarantee Measures (Continued)

Full Text Released by the Banking Association

Article 14: If an employee resigns or is dismissed from the bank, his Class A guarantee deposit and interest shall be returned only after six months from the date of his departure, if there is no situation as described in Article 12 of these rules.

(Explanation) Cases of employee embezzlement often occur after a considerable period of time after dismissal. Therefore, this article stipulates that the Class A guarantee deposit will only be returned six months after dismissal, in order to ensure thoroughness.

Article 15: When an employee applies for the return of his Class A guarantee deposit, he shall return the employee's Class A guarantee deposit passbook for cancellation, and the recipient shall sign and seal the passbook.

(Explanation) This article stipulates that the recipient shall sign and seal the passbook to indicate that the original amount paid has been fully recovered, in order to show its importance.

Article 16: If an employee's Class A guarantee deposit passbook is lost during the service period, he may state the reasons and apply to the head office through the service bank for a replacement. If it is lost after leaving the bank, he shall find a guarantor, fill out a receipt, and be allowed to return the principal and interest. The original passbook shall also be declared invalid by the employee in the newspaper.

(Explanation) This article is the ordinary procedure that should be followed when applying for a replacement for a lost document.

Article 17: When an employee who has resigned, been suspended, retained, laid off, or dismissed returns to the bank to work, if his original Class A guarantee deposit has not been returned, he may return the old passbook, settle the interest, and exchange it for a new passbook.

(Explanation) This article is to make the interest on the Class A guarantee deposit clear for the employee's service periods before and after. Therefore, it is stipulated that the old passbook shall be used to settle the interest and exchange it for a new passbook for rectification.

Article 18: An employee who resigns or is dismissed from the bank shall have his Class B guarantee deposit fully or partially refunded only after six months from the date of his departure, and after the proportional compensation of Article 13. However, after the implementation of these rules, an employee who has served in the bank for less than five years, or who is dismissed or expelled in accordance with the Bank Employee Reward and Punishment Rules, shall not be refunded his Class B guarantee deposit.

(Explanation) Since the nature of the Class B guarantee deposit is equal to credit insurance, it is in accordance with the principle of risk sharing in insurance, the so-called "Law of Average" Law of Average, to compensate for the loss of B with the credit insurance fee of A. In fact, according to the credit insurance methods of various banks in China and foreign countries, the credit insurance fee cannot be recovered. However, for the sake of consideration, the principal or balance of the Class B guarantee deposit will be refunded, actively encouraging employees to be cautious and fair, and passively reducing the occurrence of embezzlement. Because if there is embezzlement, in addition to the individual's private property being compensated first, the Class B guarantee deposit jointly deducted by the employees will be used to make up for the loss. The more embezzlement, the greater the loss suffered by the employees, and the less embezzlement, the less the loss of the employees. It is enough to make everyone have a relationship of interest and supervise each other closely. As a result, it can arouse the moral concept of employees and achieve the effect of eliminating abuses and purifying customs. If it is stipulated that it will not be refunded, then once the Class B guarantee deposit is paid, it will be like a donation. Employees are indifferent to it and cannot have a personal interest concept, that is, there is no active effect. The provision of refund in these rules is better than no refund. If they are dismissed or expelled for committing a mistake, then their behavior has violated the expectations of the bank, and there is no need to encourage them again. Therefore, it will not be refunded. It is also stipulated that service must be full three years, which is to stimulate the employee's perseverance in service.

Article 19: An employee who receives the principal or the balance of the Class B guarantee deposit shall issue a receipt.

(Explanation) Same as Article 15

Article 20: The principal and interest of the Class A guarantee deposit and the principal of the Class B guarantee deposit (all or the balance) of a deceased employee shall be received by the beneficiary of the deceased's will, or by the legal heirs if there is no will.

(Explanation) If an employee's Class A and Class B guarantee deposits have not been used to compensate for losses, they can be returned to the bank six months after retirement. Therefore, the two guarantee deposits are the employee's personal property. If they die, they should be received by the person designated by their will. If there is no will, they should be received by the legal heirs.

Article 20: If there is no compensation situation as stipulated in Article 11 of the employee guarantee reserve fund stipulated in Article 11, or the amount of compensation is very small, the chairman and general manager may approve the extraction of a certain percentage to carry out employee welfare facilities.

(Explanation) Welfare facilities can actively improve the morality and cultivation of employees. In European and American countries, bank personnel management pays great attention to this point. This article stipulates that the guarantee reserve fund may be extracted to carry out welfare facilities after a considerable period of time if there is no compensation situation or the amount of compensation is very small. Therefore, it shows that the existence or absence of embezzlement is related to the personal interests of employees, and also shows the bank's intention to reward good deeds, so that employees can reflect on themselves when they are free, and change if they have improper behavior, and work harder if they don't.

Article 21: The storage, receipt, and payment of various employee guarantee deposits shall be handled by the head office.

(Explanation) Same as Article 18

Article 23: After an employee embezzlement case occurs, other employees in the same bank branch who have one of the following circumstances shall be subject to joint and several sanctions. The methods shall be handled in accordance with the Bank Employee Reward and Punishment Rules.

㊀ Those who jointly or jointly handle the job in the same bank branch

㊁ The direct supervisor of the same bank branch

㊂ Other persons who should be subject to joint and several sanctions as approved by the chairman and general manager

(Explanation) Employees in the same bank branch spend the day together, and their relationship is very close. In the past, it was often because the supervisor neglected management, was too indifferent to colleagues, and there was a lack of mutual supervision among colleagues, and there were situations of knowing but not reporting, which prevented the budding of embezzlement. Therefore, this article stipulates joint and several sanctions. All those who have one of the first to third circumstances should be subject to joint and several sanctions. Because within this scope, all colleagues should pay close attention to each other, so as not to lose the spirit of internal restraint. If they do not pay attention, they will be subject to joint and several sanctions, and they are also to blame. Moreover, this method has long been used in the habit of our country's banking industry. These rules only add an explicit provision.

Article 24: If an employee discovers or reports an embezzlement by an employee, and the bank is not subject to or reduces losses, the person who discovers or reports shall be exempted from joint and several sanctions, and the bank shall also reward him. The methods shall be handled in accordance with the Bank Employee Reward and Punishment Rules. However, if the reported case is found to be untrue, the chairman (general manager) shall sanction it.

(Explanation) If an employee embezzlement case occurs, other employees shall be subject to joint and several sanctions in accordance with the provisions of Article 23 of these rules, which is an ex post remedy principle. If this provision discovers or reports the embezzlement of colleagues, and the bank is not subject to or reduces losses, then the whistleblower will be rewarded. The purpose is to urge employees to supervise each other and adopt a pre-prevention principle. However, in order to prevent employees from making false accusations for personal gain, it is stipulated that those who make false accusations shall also be subject to sanctions. As for the sanction methods, it seems to be out of the question, so it is not stipulated in detail, only to be determined temporarily by the chairman (general manager).

Article 25: These rules shall be implemented from the date of the Republic of China after being resolved by the board of directors.

(Note) This plan has been researched for two years. The charter has been reviewed and finally revised by the industry. (Seventh Revision) (To be continued)

### Wang Yiting, Zhu Ziqiao and Others Initiate the Construction of a Chinese Temple Pagoda in India

In Memory of Xuanzang; Land Has Been Purchased in Nalanda to Provide a Place for Chinese Pilgrims; The Buddhist Association Orders National Fundraising

The Chinese Buddhist Association sent a letter to the branch associations across the country, stating: “Case approved: Wang Yiting, Zhu Ziqiao, Feng Yangshan, and other gentlemen of the Shanghai Buddhist Laymen's Association wrote, 'Since Mahayana Buddhism crossed into China, the holy land of origin in the five Tianzhu has declined day by day and gradually perished. It has been several thousand years. Many of the holy places of the Shakya clan have fallen into the hands of foreign heretics. For example, the old site of the first Dharma wheel in Sarnath has been abandoned as a pigsty. It has only recently been redeemed by the Great Bodhi Society and rebuilt the temple. The Bodhi tree is also occupied by Indian Muslims for a long time. Buddhist disciples have called and run around, seeking a seat and not easily getting it. The image of the end of Dharma is so extremely lamentable and painful. In recent times, Buddhists in Siam, Burma, Ceylon, and other places have gradually awakened, and they have collectively sought to restore and establish temples in various important holy sites in order to increase the power of the entire Buddhist community and also provide food and lodging for their own Buddhist believers who come to worship. The intention is very good. Our country has received the true tradition of the great Dharma and is deeply grateful for it. However, our country has not yet followed up and undertaken this act of protecting the holy land. Compared with the small vehicle countries in Southeast Asia, we are lagging behind. This is due to our lack of hearing and seeing, but it is also our shame. Now there is a monk named Fuxin Bhikkhu who travels far to India to worship the pagodas. He has been practicing asceticism alone for more than ten years. He feels the strength of the heretics in that place, the difficulty of studying Buddhism and practicing the Tao, and the hardship of Chinese monks who travel far to the holy land and have nowhere to rely on. Therefore, he bought four acres of land in the Nalanda Temple area and made a vow to raise funds to build a Chinese Buddhist temple. He returned to discuss with Yiting and others, and they all agreed that the Nalanda Temple was the place where Tang Xuanzang learned the Dharma. The bright brilliance of Eastern Buddhism originated from this place. Remembering the kindness of the Dharma and the gratitude of returning to feed, the four disciples of our country should give up their heads, eyes, hands, and feet to protect, maintain, revitalize, and promote it. The site is not far from the Bodhi tree, and it is convenient to reach by car. Pilgrims can travel back and forth conveniently. Building a temple here not only commemorates the merits of the ancient ancestors who transmitted the scriptures and sought the Dharma, but also serves as the foundation for the revival of Mahayana Buddhism. People in our country who visit northern India also have a place to gather and rest. Its importance cannot be overstated. The construction plan requires approximately 13,000 yuan in national currency, which will be expanded when there are additional donations. Therefore, we would like to suggest to your association to kindly give your support and send a letter to each branch association to raise funds on our behalf. Currently, there are more than 400 branch associations. Assuming that each association can raise at least 20 yuan on our behalf, the expected amount will not be difficult to fulfill.' After investigation, the construction of a Chinese Buddhist pagoda and temple in Nalanda Temple, India, has a significant relationship with Chinese Buddhism and should be happily supported. Therefore, we specially send a letter to your association to check and hope that you will transfer it to various temples and enthusiastically provide assistance so that we can see its completion. All donations raised are hoped to be sent to our association for transfer. That is what we hope."

### Tiger Rickshaw Driver Zhang Chang'en Crippled by Accident

Petition Submitted to the Municipal Government by the French Concession Ratepayers' Association for Negotiation

The French Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association submitted a petition to the municipal government yesterday, stating: "Regarding the petition, we have received a letter from lawyer Yu Xiji, briefly stating that Zhang Pan-shi has tearfully recounted that her husband, Zhang Chang'en, 38 years old, from Tongzhou, was a tiger rickshaw driver. On the 7th of this month, at 6:00 PM, after completing his work, while walking home near the Guangci Hospital on Rue Pere Robert, he was hit from behind by a Westerner's car, injuring his left hand and foot. He was taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment for more than ten days, but the swelling remained, and the arm could not be moved. The police refused to provide a copy of the accident report. However, upon inspection, the tiger rickshaw, retrieved from the police station on the 19th, had the number "Westerner 128" written on it in white powder, indicating that the driver was undoubtedly Western Police Officer No. 128 of the French Police. The family consists of the couple and two sons and two daughters, the eldest being eleven years old and the youngest only four months old, all relying on Zhang Chang'en's income. Now that he has become disabled, the family of six has no means of livelihood. Furthermore, the police's refusal to provide an accident report is even more shocking. Left with no choice, we can only request your association to vigorously negotiate to achieve the goal of punishing the perpetrator and providing compensation. Therefore, we hereby submit this letter, hoping that you will consider the plight of the poor and weak, approve an investigation and negotiation to uphold justice and maintain the law." In response to this, the association immediately sent personnel to investigate. It was reported that the car involved in the accident was occupied by a French army officer, and the police are keeping the car number strictly confidential and have also ordered that no visits be allowed to the injured person. Such unreasonable oppression will leave the residents of the French Concession without any protection. In addition to replying to lawyer Yu to file a lawsuit according to the law, we respectfully request your review and approval to negotiate for the sake of public convenience."

### Young Daughter Pledged for Rent Dies Tragically from Abuse

Lu Qingchen Accused

Huo Changfu, 26 years old, a bathhouse attendant from Jiangbei at Lishui Pond outside Xiaonanmen in the Nanshi district, owed rent for one month to Lu Qingchen, 45 years old, from Hebei, who runs the Yixingshun incense paper shop at No. 74 Yixing Lane behind the Bureau Gate since October of last year. He therefore pledged his biological eight-year-old daughter, named Dai-dizi, recognizing Lu as her adoptive father to offset the debt. However, after Lu adopted Dai-dizi, he repeatedly abused her, beating her until she was injured and became ill. She died yesterday morning at 4:00 AM. Lu then requested a small coffin from the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for burial. Huo Changfu learned of this and brought Lu to the police station, notifying the local bailiff to report to the District Court. Prosecutor Li was appointed by the court to lead inspectors to the scene for an examination yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. It was determined that she died from injuries. The original plaintiff and defendant are scheduled to appear in court for interrogation.

### Taoist Priest Robbed

Mouth Filled with Mud, Unable to Resist

Shen Xiaobao, a native of Pudong, is a Taoist priest. His home is located in Shenjia Lane in Pudong. The day before yesterday afternoon at around 6:00 PM, as darkness fell, Shen was returning home with twenty-two yuan in banknotes he earned from conducting rituals. Unexpectedly, while walking along the eastern end of Xinma Road in Yangjiadu near the Jiangjia wooden bridge, three robbers with northern accents ambushed him in the darkness. Two robbers rushed out and grabbed Shen's hands, pressing him to the ground, while the third robber grabbed mud from the ground and stuffed it into Shen's mouth, preventing him from shouting. Shen resisted stubbornly, and his cheeks were punched, causing his nose and mouth to swell. Unable to resist, the robbers took a lined spring fur robe, twenty-two yuan in banknotes, a key, and a police whistle. After the robbers fled, Shen spat out the mud and rushed to report to the local security corps, but the robbers had already disappeared.

### Absurd Master Practices "Collecting Yin to Supplement Yang"

Illegal Imprisonment Case Adjourned Pending Judgment After Yesterday's Hearing

Zhang Shengzhi, a 45-year-old native of Jiangxi residing at No. 53 Baoxing Lane, Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, is engaged in the cotton cloth business in Shanghai. Deluded by superstitious rumors of "collecting yin to supplement yang" to prolong life, he selects young women as servants in his residence to perform inhumane acts. Recently, on the 20th of this month, Zhang hired Zhu Cuizhen, an 18-year-old woman from Wuxi, from a nearby matchmaking shop to work as a senior maid. The next morning, he attempted to commit indecent acts, but the woman refused. Zhang forcibly took her gold ring and bracelet and locked her in a room before leaving. The woman shouted, and a cohabitant released her. The woman then reported to the French police, and Detective Wang Zhihao went to investigate and arrested Zhang, finding several indecent photos on his person. He was taken back to the police station and sent to the Second Special District Court. The lawyer from the police department filed a public prosecution for the crime of illegal imprisonment. He was granted bail of 600 yuan, and a further hearing was scheduled. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Judge Liao Yunting presided over a renewed hearing in the First Criminal Court. Lawyer Fei Xizhen from the police department stated the case and the articles of indictment. Detective Wang Zhihao reported the circumstances of the arrest. The plaintiff, Zhu Cuizhen, testified that the defendant came to the matchmaking shop on the 20th to hire her as a maid. When she arrived at his house, she asked where the madam was. The defendant said she had gone out to buy groceries and then said she had gone to play mahjong. That night, the defendant and his wife did not return, and she stayed alone in the room. The next morning, the defendant returned, took away her gold ring and bracelet, locked the door, and left. She shouted, and a cohabitant came and let her out. Later, the cohabitant told her that the defendant had replaced more than twenty senior maids in a month. She then reported to the police station and requested an investigation. The defendant denied the facts, claiming that his wife had returned to her hometown on business and denying any illegal imprisonment. He hired a lawyer to defend him. The court, after reviewing the case, considered the facts clear and announced the conclusion of the debate, scheduling the judgment for the 30th of this month. The defendant was released on the original bail.

### Import Tax on Shipbuilding Materials Not Yet Waived Recently

Shipbuilding Industry Hopes Government Will Pay Attention

Recently, various newspapers have reported that import taxes on shipbuilding materials will be waived in the future. According to the authorities of the Jiangnan Shipyard, "China's industry is not yet fully developed, and most shipbuilding materials are purchased from abroad. Both freight and taxes are required, and the cost is higher than that of ships built abroad. Moreover, ships built abroad are exempt from import duties when they return, making it even more difficult for domestic shipyards to compete, affecting the future of the shipping industry and the livelihoods of workers. This shipyard has petitioned the government to levy taxes on all ships built abroad that are imported back into the country or to exempt domestic shipyards from taxes on imported shipbuilding materials to ensure fairness, but it has not yet been approved. The recent reports in newspapers that import taxes on shipbuilding materials will be waived in the future are not true."

### Embezzled Huge Sums, Went to Jiaxing for Prostitution, Arrested for Extravagant Behavior

Xu Weizhong Hired His Brother-in-law as Accountant, Trusted the Wrong Person

Xu Weizhong, from Zhenhai, Ningbo, opened the Zhenghe Cotton Cloth Shop at No. 429 Ningbo Road and hired his brother-in-law, Jiang Baoxiang (also known as Li'e, 33 years old, also from Zhenhai) as an accountant at a monthly salary of twenty yuan. Recently, a customer from Hakka ordered a large batch of cotton cloth from Zhenghe Shop and paid 4,500 yuan in Ankang Bank notes and 3,500 yuan in Junshe Bank notes, which Xu handed over to Jiang for safekeeping. However, Jiang harbored malicious intentions and stole the two bank notes, exchanged them for cash at the respective banks, and fled without a trace. Xu reported this to the Old Gate Police Station and requested the First Special District Court to issue an arrest warrant. After Jiang suddenly obtained a large sum of money, he spent a portion of it to buy clothing and accessories, including three watches. The next day, he went to Sijing and then to Qingpu, staying at a small inn. That night, 1,420 yuan was stolen. Jiang, fearing that an investigation would expose his own crime, did not delve into the matter. He then went to Jiaxing and stayed in Room 7 of the Andong Inn outside the city. Because he had obtained the money easily, Jiang squandered it on prostitution and lavish spending in Jiaxing. In less than a month, he spent over a thousand yuan, arousing the suspicion of local police officers, who detained him. They found 5,471.6 yuan in cash and clothing, watches, and other items worth over 200 yuan. After questioning, they learned the full story of Jiang. The police station then notified the Shanghai Old Gate Police Station, and Chinese Detective Pang Ruiqing and Detective Zhu Shanghe went to Jiaxing, brought Jiang back the night before last, and escorted him to the First Criminal Court of the First District Court yesterday morning. Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the police station filed a lawsuit against him for embezzlement under Article 336, Section 2 of the Criminal Law and stated that the defendant had already confessed at the police station. However, it is still necessary to verify whether his confession is consistent with the facts, so he requested an extension of the hearing. Jiang Baoxiang completely denied the charges. As for the stolen money, in addition to the 5,400+ yuan recovered and the 1,400+ yuan stolen, there was still over 1,000 yuan, which he spent on prostitution and shopping. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confession and scheduled another hearing.

### Public Works Bureau to Reduce Road Workers by Lottery This Morning

All Road Workers Resolutely Oppose, Petitioning in All Directions Today

The Dagong News Agency reports: "The Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession is carrying out staff reductions and job cuts, planning to dismiss nine-tenths of the 1,200 road workers in the Public Works Department by means of a lottery. Upon hearing this news, all the road workers were alarmed and formed the Shanghai Public Concession Road Workers Mutual Aid Association, demanding that the authorities withdraw the decision. It is understood that the Public Works Bureau is still proceeding with its original plan and has scheduled a lottery for this morning. In addition to resolutely refusing to participate in the lottery and returning their work permits, the workers have also decided to petition the Chinese Board of Directors and various agencies and organizations today, requesting that they uphold justice and provide assistance."

Lottery This Morning: The Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession has decided to reduce nine-tenths of its road workers and will hold a lottery at 6:00 AM this morning to determine who stays and who goes. The dismissal plan is announced as follows: "Notice: In accordance with the bureau's order, all possible expenses should be reduced. Now that the salaries of staff have been reduced, economies should also be made in the area of workers. The measures are as follows: (1) Foremen and first-class workers: From January 30, 1937, until further notice, except for the Luo Biegen division, the workers hired in each district will be limited to foremen and first-class workers. The wages of these foremen and workers will be paid weekly in accordance with the current method, but if the workers are not assigned to special tasks, the amount of wages they receive will still be in accordance with the current regulations: (a) Foremen receive 79 cents, (b) 65 cents, (c) 57 cents, (d) 49 cents. (2) Luo Biegen division: In addition to foremen and first-class workers, this division also hires second-class and third-class workers. The method of paying wages is the same as that stipulated for foremen and first-class workers. The daily wage amounts for these workers will still be in accordance with the current regulations: (a) 79 cents, (b) 65 cents, (c) 57 cents, (d) 49 cents. (3) Workers with special tasks: Workers performing special tasks will be selected from among the craftsmen and first-class workers based on their performance, with a maximum of 50 workers per district. The employment period for these workers will be one week. These workers must have been trained and demonstrate their skills during work. The selection will be the responsibility of the deputy engineer and chief inspector of each district. Furthermore, for the benefit of the workers themselves, all workers are hereby warned that any direct delivery of any property to the foremen or any other staff member is prohibited and will result in immediate dismissal. This is hereby announced."

Road Workers Panic: Over 1,200 road workers in the entire Public Concession are in a state of panic because the Bureau is disregarding the livelihood of the workers and dismissing nine-tenths of them. Although they have appealed in all directions, demanding the withdrawal of the decision, they have not received any satisfactory response. The lottery is still scheduled to be held this morning. The workers have decided to refuse to participate in the lottery and return their work permits. They have prepared petitions and will petition the Chinese Board of Directors Yu Yanxiang, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and the General Labor Union today, requesting that they provide strong assistance.

### Money Industry Previously Borrowed Money From Three Banks

Plan to Transfer Collateral

The Xinsheng News Agency reports: "In 1935, the Ministry of Finance allocated 25 million yuan of financial public bonds to assist the money industry, establishing the Money Industry Supervision Committee. The Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and various commercial banks and the Money Industry Reserve Bank lent money to various money shops. The 7 million yuan from various commercial banks and the Money Industry Reserve Bank have long been repaid, but the 18 million yuan from the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications have been repeatedly extended, and approximately 14 million yuan has not yet been repaid. Most of the outstanding loans are from the Henglai and Hengxing shops, which have already closed down, followed by the Yutai and Shengchang shops. The collateral is all land deeds, but due to the decline in real estate prices, no one is interested, so the loans from the closed shops cannot be repaid, and the interest due is also delayed. The borrowing shops have requested the Money Industry Supervision Committee to negotiate with the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications to transfer the collateral to the three banks, which has been approved. Now, the prices of the collateral of the various shops are being estimated to facilitate the transfer."

### Overview of Public Utilities in the Public Concession Last Year

Summary of Reports from the Telephone Company and Others

Telephone Company: "Since the Telephone Bureau changed to charging by the number of calls on March 1st of last year, the basic telephone rates have been reduced, and the number of telephone subscribers has increased by about one-tenth compared to the previous year (excluding private branch exchanges and public telephones, there were a total of 48,761 subscribers at the end of the previous year, which increased to 53,326 subscribers at the end of last year). The company's service efficiency is excellent, and telephone installation and repair are completed in a short time. As of the end of last year, 94% of the telephones installed by the company were fully automatic, and the remaining 6% were installed in the western district on roads outside the concession and were manual. The long-distance telephone equipment in the city is expanding daily. Since February of last year, Shanghai and Japan have been able to communicate by radio. Long-distance telephone calls between Shanghai and San Francisco, London, Manila, and other places are being tested and will be available to the public this year. Before September of last year, domestic long-distance telephone calls could only reach major cities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. After the initial completion of the China Telephone Bureau's nine-province plan, long-distance telephone calls between Shanghai and Wuhan were available. Long-distance telephone calls to Guangzhou were also available on December 9th. Long-distance telephone calls to Hong Kong will also be available to the public soon. There were only 32 public telephones in the concession in the previous year. By the end of last year, there were 207. More and more large and small offices and large residences are installing private branch exchanges because they are economical and convenient, and everyone enjoys using them."

Water Company: "Due to the lower temperatures in the spring and summer of last year and the implementation of conservation measures in the area, the amount of water used by residents of the concession totaled over 15 billion gallons, a decrease of about 5% compared to the previous year. Only slightly more than three miles of new main water pipes were installed. The water company is negotiating with relevant parties on the water supply issue in the western district, and progress is smooth. It is hoped that residents in the western district will soon be supplied by the company. All equipment of the company is efficient and of good quality, and the water pipe pressure has been maintained to the level agreed upon between the Bureau of Public Works and the company."

Public Bus Company: "Last year, the Public Bus Company extended its routes in three places, and the traffic on all routes has been improved. To facilitate residents in the western district, the company added two new-style special express buses, one running between the Hongqiao Golf Club and the Bund, and one running between Zhaofeng Park and the Bund. The "A" special line was extended to the intersection of Columbia Road and Anhe Temple Road, the "A" line was extended to the corner of Kaixuan Road and Daxi Road, and the Ninth Line was also extended, westward to Zhaofeng Park and eastward to the Military Industry Road, connecting with the public buses operated by the Municipal Public Works Bureau, allowing passengers to reach the city center directly. The fares for all routes were uniformly calculated in national currency, making it more convenient to exchange money. The total number of passengers throughout the year was over 35 million, and the mileage of vehicles on the routes totaled over 5.7 million miles, both of which increased compared to the previous year."

Tram Company: "Last year, the Tram Company added ten new trolleybuses. The tram line on Yangshupu Road is being extended to Zhoujiazui and is expected to be completed at the beginning of this year. There were no changes in fares and stations last year. As of the end of last year, the total length of the tracks was 18.012 miles, a decrease of 78 miles compared to the previous year. Calculated on a single track, the total length of the tracks was 34.706 miles, the same as the previous year. There were a total of 107 trams with engines, the same number of trailers, and 109 trolleybuses. Trams on all routes traveled over 10.7 million miles and carried over 110 million passengers."

Electric Power Company: "The first half of last year saw a decline in electricity consumption by residents of the concession compared to the previous year due to the economic downturn. However, the second half of the year saw an increase, but the increase was not as large as in previous years. The company's equipment is in good condition, and its service efficiency has always been excellent. There are a total of 78,934 electricity users, and the total power transmitted is over 320,000 kilowatts. The total power generated by the power plants is over 800 million kilowatts."

Gas Company: "The new gas storage facility built on Yuqiaqing Road has been completed. The facility has four floors and is controlled by a spiral tube, with a capacity of 1.9 million cubic feet of gas. The gas plant on the base of Yangshupu Road has also been completed. There were a total of 13,450 gas users throughout the year, a decrease of 460 users compared to the previous year. The company supplied a total of over 900 million cubic feet of gas for individual residences, public and private street lights, and wholesale sales, including the company's own use."

### Dai Qin-sun Takes a Maid as Concubine, Abandons Her, Involved in Lawsuit

Also Has Affair with Another Maid, Abandons Old Love, Chen Hui-zhen Sues in Court, Asks for Alimony

Dai Qin-sun, a wealthy businessman from Suzhou residing at No. 10 Er Deli, Meibaige Road, has always been fond of women. He often takes advantage of young maids he hires. In the spring of 1932, Chen Hui-zhen, a woman from Suzhou, came to Shanghai to find work because she was not tolerated by her stepmother. She was hired by the Dai family. After a month, the love between master and servant matured, and she surprisingly learned to be a lady. Although she did not live in a separate house, Dai had already promised to make her his fifth concubine, so the family all changed the way they addressed her, calling her Fifth Miss instead of her name. This lasted until last year, a period of five years. Unexpectedly, Dai then became involved with a maid named Zhang A-jin and decided to abandon Hui-zhen. He negotiated with lawyer Zhang Ji-zu, who practices law in Suzhou, to have Hui-zhen go to the law office of Li Zu-yu to sign a severance agreement, giving her a thousand yuan. Hui-zhen then returned to Suzhou. Recently, she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Dai Qin-sun in the First Special District Court, asking for alimony. The lawsuit stated, "Since being seduced by Dai into adultery, and especially after taking me as his concubine, my parents learned of this. To avoid disputes, Dai asked Xu Lin-jine to retrieve my marriage certificate. Unexpectedly, Dai became infatuated with the new and abandoned the old. The agreement I signed, I really did not know that it was a severance agreement, and I only realized I had been deceived after Zhang Ji-zu told me after returning to Suzhou. I feel that the agreement is invalid and should be approved to sever the family relationship. I am now only 28 years old, and calculating a life of sixty years, I request the court to order the defendant to pay 60 yuan per month for my future life, totaling 23,760 yuan in national currency." Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu Fuki held a hearing. The defendant, Dai Qin-sun, did not appear. Chen Hui-zhen recounted the process of Dai Qin-sun first using sweet words to lure her, then becoming tired of the old and fond of the new, and finally betraying his promise and abandoning her. She also stated that half of the thousand yuan given by the defendant was originally her savings over the years. I was originally betrothed to a Zhang, but the defendant asked Xu Lin-jine to retrieve the eight characters. At that time, he said that if I did not retrieve the eight characters, he would die." Xu Lin-jine also testified that the defendant asked her to retrieve the eight characters. Lawyer Li Zu-yu also testified that Zhang Ji-zu accompanied the plaintiff to the office to make the agreement. The plaintiff's lawyer then stated that if there was really no relationship between master and servant, why would they need a lawyer to certify the agreement when dismissing a maid. He also presented several letters from the defendant to the plaintiff as evidence for reference. Finally, the defendant's lawyer argued, denying the facts of love between master and servant and the promise to take her as a concubine. After the court hearing, the judge announced that the judgment would be delivered on the afternoon of February 2.

### Old Clergyman Sentenced Yesterday for Injuring People with Acid

Violates the Christian Spirit of Charity and Peace, Found Guilty After Hearing, Imprisonment for Two Years and Six Months

The clergyman, an old man from Yangzhou named Wang Bao-lu (59 years old), had a long-standing feud with Qin Geng-tao, a young man from Chuansha, Pudong, who worked at the Bible Society at No. 58 Hong Kong Road, over trivial matters. On the afternoon of the 12th of this month, at 7:40 PM, Wang brought a bottle of acid to Qin Geng-tao's house. He went upstairs into their bedroom, and without asking any questions, he roared and splashed the acid on Qin's head and face, and destroyed the objects in the room. He fled back to No. 7 Sida Lane, Shigaota Road, and the patrol officer of the Huaihai Road Police Station arrested Wang and confiscated the acid bottle and detained the man at the First Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing presided over the trial in the Third Criminal Court, and the lawyer of the Public Works Bureau, Zhang Tianyin, stated that the second landlord of Qin Geng-tao, Qin's wife, and the cohabitant had come to court and could testify to what happened at the time of the incident, requesting a hearing. According to the testimony of the third landlord, Xu Yonglin, at that time, the defendant knocked on the door and I opened the door. I saw him carrying a paper package and went to see Qin on the upper floor. Then I went out because I had something to do and I don't know what happened. Xu's wife, Ms. Xu, testified that suddenly she heard a noise on the upper floor and the sound of objects being destroyed. The defendant shouted such words as "ungrateful, don't be afraid of going to court to be shot" and other words. Xu Jin, a neighbor, testified, "I heard Mr. Qin shouting for help. I thought it was a robbery. I went out to the pavilion to see it and saw an empty bottle abandoned by the door. Many of the objects in the front building were knocked down." Qin's newly married wife, Ms. Wang, testified that she was not at home when they were arguing, but her marriage was arranged by her mother and there was no quarrel with her son-in-law and no change to Buddhism or other things. The court asked the defendant about these. The defendant's testimony was cunning and evasive. The court ordered that the debate begin. Lawyer Zhang said, "Christianity is based on charity and peace. It should not be due to trivial matters. The case is about cruelty and malice, wanting to blind Qin's eyes. The court is asked to punish." Judge Zhong sentenced Wang Baolu to two years and six months of imprisonment, and the acid bottle was confiscated.

### Ham Industry Again Requests Exemption from Increased Freight Rates

The Ham Industry Trade Association held a meeting yesterday afternoon, attended by more than ten executive and supervisory committee members, including Xu Senfang and Hu Chushan. The meeting was chaired by Xu Senfang. They discussed the association's request to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Administration for exemption from increased freight rates. They received a reply from the two railway administrations today, stating that the current increase in ham freight rates was ordered by the Ministry of Railways and could not be arbitrarily changed by the railway administration. It is believed that ham is an agricultural product, and many farmers in eastern Zhejiang rely on it as a sideline to farming. In these times of agricultural and commercial decline, how can they increase the burden? Therefore, it was resolved to send another letter to the railway administration, forwarding it to the Ministry of Railways, earnestly requesting exemption, it is said.

The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce submitted a report to the Ministry of Industry, Nanjing, stating: "Upon receiving a letter from the Jiujiang Chamber of Commerce, it was stated that after reading the news report, the Ministry of Industry proposed revising the draft Chamber of Commerce Law, which is very detailed. However, Article 11 stipulates that the representatives of the association members shall not exceed five, which is too restrictive. Article 29 stipulates that the Chamber of Commerce's administrative expenses shall be borne by one-tenth to two-tenths of the total membership fees of each association, which is too small. The Association has considered the actual situation and believes that it is necessary to request a revision.

Accordingly, a copy of the original telegram is sent to your association, requesting your review.

### Singer Lai Ling's Case of Obstructing Public Morality

Dance Troupe Owner Jiang Boying Accused - Years of Affair, Suddenly Unwilling to Marry

Lai Ling, also known as Shuming, is a woman from Fuzhou, currently 21 years old, residing at No. 25 Daodeguo, Beile Road, French Concession. She loves singing and dancing and enjoys great fame in the dance world. There was a certain Jiang Boying, who has been in the film industry for a long time. In October of the 24th year, he organized a Star Technology Dance Troupe. Because he heard of Lai's fame, he tried to recruit her into the troupe. On the 19th of that month, he signed a contract with a monthly salary of 7,000 yuan and a term of six months. Since Lai joined the troupe, Jiang has treated her very well, so the two had a very harmonious relationship. Soon, an ambiguous relationship developed. In January of last year, the Star Technology Troupe went abroad to perform, performing in Bangkok, Siam, for about a month. In March of last year, he returned to China, and Jiang continued to commit adultery in You Tou, Xiamen, and other places. After returning to Shanghai, they continued to have illicit relations from time to time. Jiang also took responsibility for No. 17 Gaofu Lane, Shilin Road, as a place to hide his mistress, and sometimes had secret rendezvous at the Xin Ya Hotel. Jiang had expressed his intention to take Lai as his concubine. In addition to letters exchanged between the two, they also took several photos together, showing their passionate love. However, recently, this hidden affair was discovered by Lai's mother, Lai Sunshi, and Jiang also broke his promise to take Lai as his concubine. The woman's mother then hired lawyer Zhang Yaoqing to file a lawsuit against Jiang in the First Special District Court, requesting punishment for obstructing public morality and family crimes in accordance with Articles 228 and 240 of the Criminal Law. After receiving the complaint, the court stated that Lai Ling's age in the plaintiff's complaint was written as 20 years old and was in the position of the self-suer. The mother was the legal representative. It is necessary to investigate whether Lai Ling is already 20 years old. Therefore, Judge Xiao XieFen summoned the Lai women to the Ninth Criminal Court yesterday afternoon and questioned the age point. According to Lai Ling, she was born on October 18 of the fifth year of the Republic of China, the Year of the Dragon, which means she is already 20 years old. There is no need for a legal representative. The court then ordered the complaint to be corrected and announced a postponement to wait for the defendant to be summoned for further questioning.

Women's Special

### A Word to Unmarried Young Women!

— Ding Xiaoru

Here, let me tell you something that cannot be ignored!

Marriage is indeed a serious issue in the minds of women. Whether in terms of physiology, psychology, spirit, or life, there will be a tremendous change during this period! In other words, it is also a crucial key to a woman's lifelong happiness.

Of course, love is the element of marriage, and happiness comes from the union of love. But there is something even more important than love, and that is the other person's health.

A discerning woman considers this aspect when choosing a partner. But what I'm talking about doesn't just refer to men who are noticeably thin and weak, with "tuberculosis" or "malignant anemia" and so on. What is easily overlooked is the other person having a "venereal disease that is not easily seen externally, and has become chronic"—"syphilis" or "gonorrhea."

In this prosperous city, especially in the evil Shanghai! The spread of venereal diseases is truly terrifying! There is even a rumor of "nine out of ten men have gonorrhea, and nine out of ten women have leucorrhea." Some people who like to frequent brothels even admit that venereal disease is a kind of fashionable disease. Since most venereal disease patients are fashionable men, then modern women who love to date must pay special attention when choosing a partner!

An unmarried young woman is like a delicate flower about to bloom. If she is unfortunately harmed by this evil disease after marriage, it is like a flower just blooming, suffering the ravages of a storm! It is very easy to wither. We often see some women become more plump and beautiful because of the healthy "endocrine" stimulation and hyperactivity of married life! But some women who were originally in good shape suddenly become surprisingly haggard after marriage! Needless to say, it must be because they have been infected with venereal disease by their husbands. After a woman is infected with venereal disease, "vaginitis" develops locally, causing swelling, pain, and purulent leucorrhea. The external genitalia are ulcerated and eroded, or develop "soft" and "hard chancres," and "syphilitic rashes," etc. It can even cause "endometritis" and "peritonitis," and lead to loss of life! Even if cured, it will definitely hinder fertility, or lead to miscarriage. If it is "syphilis," it will be transmitted to the fetus, and a lifetime of happiness will be sacrificed!

From a family perspective, how can such a married life be considered "happy" and "pleasant"? Since the husband has venereal disease, his usual morals and behavior can be imagined. (People who commit "rape" are mostly afflicted with venereal diseases, as can often be seen in "social news." There are even immoral husbands who cause their wives to develop "rectal gonorrhea," causing anal stenosis and harming them for life.) But because this disease is disreputable, they are even more embarrassed to tell others about their husband's sins. It is truly "a dumb person eating Coptis chinensis, unable to express the bitterness"! Both mentally and physically, they suffer great pain and loss! The husband enjoys himself outside, while the wife suffers innocent disasters. How can this be explained? (Venereal disease is more likely to ruin a woman's youth than childbirth.)

In the past, there was a saying about old-fashioned women getting married: "Getting on the decorated sedan, picking up a bad luck ticket"! That just shows the badness of old-fashioned marriages. But if a new-era woman only pays attention to other conditions when choosing a husband, and neglects the other person's health, and is unfortunately infected with this terrible venereal disease, then that is truly considered "extremely bad luck"!

Since the relationship is so important, how can it be ignored? Therefore, I hope that unmarried young women must be cautious beforehand and never lightly risk their bodies and make this pointless sacrifice. Originally, it is most immoral for a person with venereal disease to marry someone! Although the current laws stipulate that "divorce is allowed if the other party has incurable venereal disease," once infected, it is already too late. It is better to prevent problems before they occur. In Europe and the United States, both men and women exchange "health certificates" when holding a wedding ceremony. This is indeed a good method, and our country may as well emulate it. Especially now that group weddings are prevalent, this procedure can be added during registration. (It is best to designate a doctor to examine them to prevent abuse. If one has venereal disease, they will not be allowed to marry unless completely cured—because if it has become chronic, even the patient often thinks they are completely cured. This is not just a matter of personal happiness and health for women, but it also has a great impact on the race! Aren't we trying to revitalize the nation? Then, a strong country must first have a strong race. If the mother's body is unfortunately harmed by venereal disease, how can strong children be produced? This is something that unmarried women should pay even more attention to!

### Novel Occupations for American Women

— Hua Ling

America is a country where women's occupations are highly developed, and at the same time, due to the necessities of life, some women's occupations are uniquely styled. Here are a few examples:

㊀ Home Designer　These home designers are hired by families who appreciate modern styles, and they visit once or twice a week. For each family, based on the degree of light, angles, climate, and other factors, they design the placement of all the furniture. Even small items like picture frames and vases are included in the design. The design of the colors of utensils and other items also falls within their scope. As for tablecloths, curtains, and the addition of furniture, it is naturally essential for the designer to be consulted. It is said that this occupation is exclusively held by women. Although there are no precise statistics on the number of people engaged in this profession nationwide, it is at least over a thousand. The most famous designers, such as the Bliss Group in New York, can earn between five and six hundred dollars per month. The average is around one hundred fifty to two hundred fifty dollars. Some are paid per visit, with the highest price being ten dollars. However, some go as low as three or four dollars.

㊁ New Wardrobe Advisor　This is also one of the unique professions for women. The scope of their advice is not limited to new clothing. It includes everything from clothes, shoes, and hats to applying makeup and correcting posture for walking, sitting, and sleeping. Therefore, their services can be said to encompass the formation of all aspects of female beauty. The history of these new wardrobe advisors is less than ten years old, but now they have spread to major cities across the country. New York and Hollywood are particularly concentrated areas for these advisors. In addition, there are many active in Chicago, Washington, and other places. In New York alone, it is said that there are nearly three hundred new wardrobe advisors. Most of these advisors are skilled in painting. They understand the principles of color coordination and various lines, carefully study female beauty around the world, and consider local climate and living habits. Therefore, the women who are shaped by their guidance are always beautiful and harmonious. Their visits are unscheduled and promptly follow the client's call. The fee for each contract ranges from forty to eighty dollars per month. Each visit typically costs between five and ten dollars, with the level of fame of the advisor being the standard for the price. The most famous in New York, Miss Rima and Mrs. Goddard, have accumulated fortunes of over one hundred thousand to two hundred thousand dollars from this profession.

㊂ Companion for Life　There is also a type of profession called "companion for life," which has emerged in the United States in the last three years as a new occupation for women. Whether at home, traveling, or shopping, one can have a companion for life. The main requirements for being a companion for life are to be knowledgeable, have a thorough understanding of all levels of society, have beautiful speech, and, most importantly, be rich in humorous and amusing stories. If one also has some musical or scientific knowledge or experience in household management or infant care, that is even better. In American homes, many high-society women fear the loneliness of living alone. Although there are clubs suitable for women's recreation in every city, there are also quite a few women who do not like going to clubs or are tired of them. To alleviate the mental suffering of these women, it is now generally recognized that there is nothing better than calling a companion for life to talk to. Because a companion for life can say things that suit the client's tastes. They can talk about anything and everything, making you feel extremely satisfied. If you have a companion for life while traveling, it can not only avoid the loneliness of the journey but also bring many conveniences. The fee for this type of companion is typically between five and ten dollars per day. Although it is still in its infancy, it is said that there are already nearly a hundred people in New York alone. It is predicted that its future development will be quite astonishing.

### The Causes of Mental Disorders During Pregnancy

— Shi Hua

When women reach the stage of pregnancy, their mental state is often exceptionally sensitive to light. They dislike sunlight and prefer dimness, and their sense of taste is also overly sensitive. When choosing food, they must choose those with stimulating flavors—especially a preference for sour things. Their senses of smell and hearing are also particularly sensitive; they dislike children and fear noise, and so on.

People often say that this arises from worrying about the pain of childbirth, but this is not really the case; that is only a superficial explanation. The real causes are approximately three major reasons: mechanical, chemical, and fetal detoxification.

1. Mechanical Reasons: During pregnancy, the internal organs of the abdomen gradually expand as the fetus grows, exerting a kind of pressure in all directions, and as a result, obvious changes occur in the mental state.

2. Chemical Reasons: Normally, women's blood contains a lot of water, but during pregnancy, there is even more than before. Therefore, the nutrition of the nerves is prone to a kind of deterioration.

3. Fetal Detoxification Reasons: As the fetus grows day by day in the mother's body, it cannot but have digestion, respiration, and excretion; what is excreted is all in the mother's blood, so the mother inevitably experiences mental obstacles. And the mental life also takes on a unique state.

Sisters who are currently pregnant, now that you understand these causes, you should no longer worry. You should always be happy because the mother's worries are not beneficial to the fetus.

### Women: Go Out Into the Sunlight

— Zi Fu

The weather is gradually getting colder, and people who are always afraid of the cold are about to enter a dormant period again, staying by the stove all day and reluctant to go out easily. In fact, from a hygienic point of view, this is so inappropriate.

Nowadays, people living urban lives, especially those living in large cities, rarely have some opportunities to come into contact with sunlight or engage in sunbathing. On the one hand, this is of course because there are fewer places to come into contact with sunlight in large cities; at the same time, it must also be said that people are not paying attention to this aspect. In particular, Chinese women, who have always had inactive habits, find it difficult to come into contact with sunlight if they live in large cities. Therefore, in recent years, the rate of diseases caused by vitamin D deficiency among women in cities has been increasing day by day.

Now, winter is fast approaching again. Women living in big cities are probably going to have even fewer opportunities to come into contact with sunlight. According to the statistics over the years, in winter, there are more diseases caused by vitamin D deficiency than in any other season. This phenomenon is especially pronounced among women. So, what kind of relationship does sunlight actually have with vitamins?

Anyone with a little bit of hygienic common sense knows that there is a type of light in sunlight called ultraviolet rays. This type of light can pass through the skin and produce vitamins in the blood. From this, it can be known that people who have little contact with sunlight naturally have a smaller amount of vitamin D that can be produced in their blood. If the human body lacks vitamin D, then the metabolism of inorganic salts and phosphates cannot be fully carried out, thereby causing poor bone development and diseases such as rickets and osteomalacia. In general, in places where ultraviolet rays are insufficient, the number of people suffering from these diseases is very large. For example, among black people in New York, it is said that the rate of suffering from this disease reaches ninety percent. Although there are no accurate statistics on the rate of women in Shanghai suffering from this disease, it must be quite alarming.

As the material civilization of cities increases day by day, this terrible phenomenon caused by vitamin D deficiency is becoming more and more profound. The reason is that, on the one hand, the buildings in cities are becoming taller and taller, reducing the scope of sunlight exposure; on the other hand, the increasing concentration of dust and smoke in cities is also a reason for weakening ultraviolet rays. Based on this point, it can be inferred that the terror of vitamin D deficiency will inevitably become even more profound in the future. At the same time, this terror will pose a greater threat to women.

In order to remedy this deficiency, we really need to quickly develop the habit of having more contact with sunlight. Especially in winter, we should not stay at home because we are afraid of the cold. We should make full use of opportunities to have full contact with sunlight. If you can sunbathe for two hours every day, then vitamin D should not be lacking. This can be said to be the best natural method. In addition, in order to supplement the deficiency, eating more foods containing vitamin D is certainly very good. However, the effect of the former is really greater than the latter.

### To Ms. B

— Zhuo Dai

It is very easy for me to solve the matter about which your father wanted to hear my opinion. He said, "After an old tree in the courtyard died, we planned to replace it with another tree; but this plan has been in the works for almost eight or nine years, and it has not been successful so far. Because trees with a slightly better shape are often extremely expensive, and we do not have this budget in our expenses, so we cannot do it. As for cheap trees, they are all so terrible that they are often not enough to decorate this empty courtyard. What is a suitable way to solve this problem?"

I can solve this matter with an extremely simple method. That is, don't be constrained by the fact that what died before was a tree, so now you must plant a tree. Just plant more than one tree, and the problem is completely solved.

You must know that any tree that can be planted independently must have independent qualifications, so its shape, etc., must be very beautiful, and the price is of course considerable.

Now we are complaining that the price is too expensive and want to be more economical. We might as well first pick a tree that is suitable in size. For example, if you want one that is fifteen feet tall, then as long as it is fifteen feet tall, don't worry about the shape being a bit bad.

After you have selected this tree, see where its shortcomings are? Suppose its treetop is not bad, and it is also proportional, but there is one side that has no branches, almost like a missing corner. Then, just pick another tree and plant it next to it (that is, on the missing side) to supplement its shortcomings. A tree that can stand alone can form a "scene" on its own. A tree that cannot stand alone can be used two or three times to create a "scene"; but when choosing this first tree, there are two points to pay close attention to. First, this supplementary tree only needs to have branches on one side, not on all four sides. Only having branches on one side can compensate for the lack of branches on one side. Second, the second tree must not only be lower than the first tree, but also have a treetop that is proportional to the treetop of the first tree. For example, if the treetop of the first tree is one hundred and sixty degrees, then when the second tree is planted next to it, its treetop must be able to supplement its angle. If the angle is too large or too small, they will not match.

In this way, combining two trees into one scene, both of which are defective, the price will naturally be very cheap. The reasoning for combining three trees into one scene is exactly the same. Once you understand this meaning, you can apply it greatly. And depending on what the shortcomings of the first tree are, it is not necessarily necessary to match another tree to make up for the deficiency. Sometimes, matching a stone or other object can also become a scene. This depends on the shape of the tree, so I cannot give an example.

If a group of more than one tree is used to create a scene, then the most important thing is that the treetops of each tree must be within an angle; and the places where each tree approaches each other should preferably have sparse branches (or no branches). This is not only to supplement the shortcomings of these trees with poor shapes, but it is also in line with the natural living state of trees. Madam, please observe: No matter where, if several trees are gathered together, the branches and leaves on the outer periphery are very lush, but the branches and leaves at the places where the trees meet are often very undeveloped. Also, a tallest tree, with its treetop making a certain degree, the other trees will definitely match its angle and live next to it. This is very wonderful. A group of trees is like a group of human beings. In a group of people, a tycoon emerges, and the rest of the people obey this tycoon. Trees can actually do this as well.

Please tell your father to do it according to this method. Not only will it cost limited, but the scene that is formed may be more beautiful than the old tree that died eight or nine years ago.

### Shameless

— Qin Chen

One evening, Yi Qiu and Zhu Jun inadvertently walked past that small street near the East New Bridge that was filled with girls selling human flesh; at that time, Yi Qiu opened her mouth first:

"What does this mean? Perfectly good people willingly do such dirty things. Don't they even understand shame?" As she spoke, she was looking at a prostitute who was using all her strength to drag a young worker into a small alley with an extremely contemptuous look in her eyes.

Zhu Jun's opinion was completely different from hers. There was no contempt in her eyes, only a sense of pity.

"I don't think so!" She sighed with emotion. "Don't you see that they are just like us, with faces, limbs, able to walk, and able to speak? At first, they may not have known shame, and they also absolutely hated it like you, but life pressed down on them heavily. They have lost all freedom and can only bow their heads and barely eke out their last breath."

"Then why must they live? Isn't it better to seek death early with this kind of life!" Yi Qiu seemed extremely indignant. When she finished walking through that small street and was about to reach the corner, she still turned her head back and glared.

"Death? It's not necessarily easy!..."

Before Zhu Jun could finish speaking, Yi Qiu interrupted her.

"Jumping into the river, hanging, taking medicine, there are many ways, what's so difficult about dying?"

"You can't say it that way! If they want to die themselves, others won't let them die! For example, their pimps will be the first to not allow them to die! Furthermore, their parents, brothers, or husbands and other relatives are often the direct reasons for preventing them from seeking death, or the indirect reasons that make them unable to die." Zhu Jun was not older than Yi Qiu, but she had a special skill in observing worldly affairs, and she estimated the environment of even the lowest prostitutes very clearly. "And although they are very bitter now, they all still hope that there will be a day when they will be able to get ahead in the future, so they themselves are not willing to die, and they are willing to endure."

"This kind of endurance is shameless!" Yi Qiu still couldn't understand.

"No, definitely not!" Zhu Jun immediately retorted her. "Because they didn't originally intend to engage in this kind of business, so their current endurance is not shameless!"

The two people's opinions fundamentally clashed, and it was difficult to talk anymore, so they both walked silently; later, Zhu Jun suddenly thought of something else.

"Qiu, I'll give you a counter-argument! Do you think that Liu Ying, that sophomore in the law department, is shameless?"

"What are you talking about?" Yi Qiu obviously felt very surprised.

"I said that she doesn't lack food or clothing, just because she likes to show off, she willingly mixes with many male classmates; and in order to get a few more points, she constantly goes to the movies with that pockmarked professor." Zhu Jun used her heel to slam a brick in the cement. "I think she's much more shameless than those prostitutes!"

With this counter-example, Yi Qiu was completely convinced, and a kind of extremely contemptuous expression appeared on her face for the second time.

### Utilization of Discarded Tea Leaves

— (Zhan Tianxian)

Tea is one of the seven necessities of life, and it is essential for people. Many people are very particular about drinking tea. There is no need for me to mention things like Green Armor, Red Robe, Cloud Mist, Dragon Well, and so on... so many names. As for what kind of taste each one has and how good it is, I don't drink tea very much, so I don't know much about this, so I won't talk about it. However, people treat the leftover tea leaves from brewing as useless and discard them casually. Little do they know that they have many uses. Now, according to what I know, I will write them down below:

1. Pour the leftover tea leaves into a jar, add water, and use this water to water plants every day, which can help them grow.

2. People suffering from eye diseases often have their eyes sealed shut after sleeping and cannot open them. Use the leftover tea leaves to rinse them with hot water, which is more effective than plain water.

3. Applying leftover tea leaves to sores and broken skin has the function of not sticking, absorbing water, and promoting the growth of new flesh.

4. Using leftover tea leaves to wash greasy pots, bowls, tables, cups, chopsticks, and other items makes them exceptionally clean.

5. Dry the leftover tea leaves in the sun, crush them, store them, and use them as kindling in small stoves in the winter, which lasts a very long time.

6. Dry the leftover tea leaves in the sun, put them in a pillowcase, and pillow your head with them, which is not only soft, but is also said to clear heat.

7. Dry tea leaf scraps can drive away moisture. Sprinkle some in a place with moisture today, and the moisture will disappear tomorrow.

8. Wrap dry tea leaf scraps in paper, light them, and use them to drive away flies during the day and mosquitoes at night.

Even a little bit of discarded tea leaves has so many uses. No wonder the ancients said that bamboo roots and wood shavings are all useful. Therefore, the saying "waste utilization" can be proved especially reasonable.

### Mussolini's Wife

— Yi Fa

Everyone knows about the modern great man Mussolini. However, very little is known about his wife. Some people are also rumored to be living separately because divorce is not allowed in Italy. Moreover, the fact that she has already given birth to their fourth and fifth children proves their affection.

Mussolini has never appeared with his wife at public gatherings. Among the kings, nobles, diplomats and officials of various countries who met with Mussolini, there are absolutely few who have been able to meet Mrs. Rachele. When Mussolini uses his own name to hold banquets in hotels, she is not seen standing side by side with Mussolini to greet guests. Mussolini said in his autobiography: "I belong to the public, and what belongs to the public does not belong to any individual."

In various magazines around the world today, photos of Mussolini are everywhere, but photos of this wife are not easy to find. Because Italian women are definitely not the same as British, American, French, and German women. They try their best to avoid things that hinder their husbands. She of course loves Mussolini very much, and quietly undertakes the education of the children at home.

Mrs. Rachele is of humble origin, just like Mussolini. She is from Forlì in northern Italy. She lost her father early and was raised by her mother, Anna. When she was five years old, she helped with drawing water, sweeping, and raising livestock. She only read for two years, from the age of six to eight. Later, she worked as a servant. After Mussolini seized power, she still often went to the countryside to visit old friends.

In 1905, Mussolini's father opened a tavern on Forlì Street, receiving travelers and passers-by. Anna managed the dishes, and Rachele also helped by the side. At that time, Mussolini was expelled from Switzerland and returned to Italy due to his political activities. He and several socialist youths spent their days in the tavern, expounding his arguments. Thus, the seventeen-year-old Rachele and the twenty-four-year-old Mussolini fell in love.

The following year, Mussolini was expelled from Austria again and lived at Rachele's house in Forlì. In 1911, they lived in Milan. Mussolini was a newspaper editor with a monthly salary of one hundred yuan. The couple and their eldest daughter, Edda, lived in Milan for ten years. During this period, Mussolini was imprisoned twice and went to the front line for a year. After marching on Rome and seizing power, he never returned to Milan. When Mussolini was forming his cabinet, his wife was still living in a Milan apartment, handling household affairs and being a loyal Italian housewife. Their two sons, who were studying in school, were the young aviation officers Albino and Vittorio during the invasion of Abyssinia last year. Later, Mr. and Mrs. Mussolini had two more children.

Mussolini was awarded Italy's highest medal, and his wife was called by the honorific title of "Donna." The recipient of this medal is qualified to be a brother to the king. If Mrs. Rachele liked socializing, then even if Mussolini did not have this merit, she could freely enter and exit social circles, but this was not to the liking of the lady.

There had been rumors about Mussolini and famous women in the world. In 1926, Mussolini was almost assassinated in Bologna. At that time, Mussolini urgently sought a safe place to live and returned to his wife's side. Although she does not have much profound knowledge, she has a good understanding of Mussolini's words, deeds, and thoughts. Mussolini's father had warned Rachele before their marriage: "You don't have to think about my son's affairs, this kind of thing is like throwing yourself on the tracks. If you marry him, you will have no happiness or peace." But she did not accept this advice and married Mussolini.

Mrs. Rachele, who now lives in Villa Torlonia in Rome, is so harmonious and happy, although Mussolini is definitely not a husband who likes to flatter women. According to Mussolini's autobiography, it can be known that Mussolini not only belongs to Mrs. Rachele, but also belongs to the emerging Italy.

Talks

### Ugaki Makes Final Effort to Form Cabinet

— I

The Japanese Hirota Cabinet, after the February 26th Incident, received the imperial order to form a cabinet. After several rounds of discussions and deliberations, the cabinet was finally formed. However, it is difficult to please both sides. The Hirota Cabinet eventually collapsed due to differing opinions between the army and navy. Hirota was in office for less than a year, and he had to resign to apologize to the world because of the mess of events and conflicting intentions.

After Hirota's departure, the task of forming a cabinet fell on General Ugaki. Ugaki once served as the Governor-General of Korea and had a high reputation. He is also an old senior of the army faction, so it was generally speculated that there would be no problem for him to form a cabinet; who knew that things would turn out unexpectedly. The army's attitude was strong, the navy's mediation failed, and to this day, Ugaki has not yet expressed his intention to give up forming a cabinet. Making a final effort, but without making even minimal progress, Ugaki's cabinet formation, looking at the current situation, will undoubtedly end in failure.

In short, the current political situation in Japan, the struggle between the political parties and the military, has reached its final stage. Either the political parties surrender to the military, or the military surrenders to the political parties. The current situation of confrontation between the two sides is extremely serious. Not only can Ugaki's cabinet not proceed smoothly, but anyone else will also find it difficult to organize. Judging from the situation of the two sides, the camp of those with guns is very strong, and the situation of those without guns is also quite strong. It is difficult to solve this problem without going through an extremely serious situation and sacrifice.

According to Japanese newspapers yesterday, General Ugaki entered the palace this morning to meet with Minister of the Interior Yuasa to discuss opening the difficult door to cabinet formation. When he returned to his private residence, three uninvited guests followed him in, damaging one of Ugaki's silk high hats, demanding that Ugaki withdraw in the face of difficulty, with no intention of causing harm. Judging from this, Ugaki can rest. The meaning is that if Ugaki refuses to retreat this time and insists on doing it, there may be other or second-step unfortunate events. What kind of people advocate this, and what kind of people are standing behind it, does not require guessing to see it clearly.

### The Yearning for the Sea

— Luo Zhihua

Gorky said, "Children are the flowers of the world." When I use this sentence to measure my childhood, I often feel that I am a flower like thousands of other children, trampled on and never fully blossomed. In my childhood, although my family was against weakness, cowardice, and compromise, they did not allow me to develop bravely. They themselves compromised with society, wanting me to be an ordinary person with a comfortable life, wanting me to blossom into a flower that was neither too fat nor too thin. This was the kind of soil they prepared for me. Thus, I was cruelly trampled on.

However, I am a person. I can move, I can choose a life that suits me, an environment that can nurture me into a rebel.

I have lived in this environment for a long time, and those trampled-on characteristics, like the lines written by a young Jewish poet:

"Killed without sin,
Truth brings him back to life!..."

Have all regained life in this soil.

I am like a tiger locked in a cage, relearning all my skills. I am like a petrel soaring out of the dense fog of the valley...

I yearn to see the sea, the sea that leaps in poetry and prose. I yearn even more for the life of the petrel that prophesies the coming of storms on its breast. However, I have no chance to sail, and I have never even seen the coast. Every time I hear my friends' fiery narrations, my heart is intoxicated by them.

I have a young friend who is now a naval student. Their warship is stationed in the waters near Fujian. Every time I correspond with him, I always hope he can tell me about the ocean he sees every day: how the waves turn, how they hit the ship Tung-Tung, how quiet it is when the tide recedes, and whether the beauty of the beach is like the skin of a plump girl, how the sun embroiders colorful clouds in the east...

But he can never answer me fully. He can only say very conceptually: the sea rises and falls like human emotions, heroic, calm...

I think: go see the sea, find an opportunity, go to Wusong, isn't it very convenient? There are undulating waves there! Very close, doesn't cost much money...

"But there is no great sea there," a friend said, "the water there is turbid and not majestic; seeing it will disappoint you, so keep yearning!"

Once, I went with a workers' theater troupe to a school not far from Wusong to perform. When the play ended at one o'clock at night, we stayed in the student dormitory. The host told us: "Get up early tomorrow morning and go to the beach to play, you can see the sunrise!"

I was the happiest first, although I knew: the sea in Wusong is not great and majestic, but I also knew: there are all kinds of seas, just like the soil of the living environment cultivates all kinds of different people and flowers, like me, a yearner for the sea, a petrel just breaking through the dense fog and flying towards the sea, seeing the sea, no matter what kind it is, should be good, right? --There were also a few people who had never seen the sea, and they thought the same way.

The next day, the morning stars were still shining, the blades of grass were still hanging with dew, we braved the autumn wind and ran out of the dormitory.

However, we couldn't find the host, and we didn't know how to get there. We were very disappointed. We waited until we were about to return to Shanghai before the host came back.

The boat moved forward in the Huangpu River. The sun had already come out, but it was cloudy, cold, and dark. Several people sang songs, their facial skin looking a little tight.

My eyes looked at the river water, which was yellow, the tide rolled forward, as if tightly wrapping a roll of sand and rolling forward, impacting the ships and the riverbanks,发出愤怒的吼叫呐喊。 A wave was repelled, shattered, and submerged in the water, then another rushed up, as if it would never stop, unless the enemy retreated...

I looked at the river water flowing down from upstream, which was full of waves. Especially when the sun opened its eyes, the tide in the heart of the river was plated with a thick layer of gold, like steel...

### Pressed Under the Mountain

— Surrender

There is a passage in "Journey to the West": Sun Wukong was pressed under the mountain by the Buddha, and he could no longer make trouble in the heavenly palace! It can be seen that "mountain" is the most powerful. We also have a saying: "Mount Tai stone dares to stand."

If a person suffers from spermatorrhea, the gonorrhea bacteria make trouble in the human body, causing the person to feel extremely painful. If inferior medicine is taken by mistake, not only will the gonorrhea bacteria not be overcome, but the opportunity for treatment will be missed!

Only the new gonorrhea treatment drug "Deli Ping" can directly reach the lesion and completely eliminate the gonorrhea bacteria. Whether it is new or old gonorrhea, it can be cured quickly. It does not contain ingredients that irritate the kidneys or hinder digestion. The effect is indeed effective and there are no side effects.

Therefore, "Deli Ping" has great pressure, which can kill the gonorrhea bacteria and cut off its harm, so that patients can jump out of the devil's net and step into the bright road.

## Page 20

After being tempered, it becomes more solid, bright, and powerful... One hand clung to the railing of the boat, and the other hand stroked the slanting iron tow rope. I listened to the whistling of the river water, singing in my mouth, as if my hand was composing a song for it.

The water flows eastward, towards the sea. Everyone who supports the truth is like a grain of iron powder, running towards the magnet. The river water ran to the sea...

When will I be able to see the sea? He has a full and broad chest, he has strong arms, he has a loud singing voice, but when will he use his strong arms to embrace us in his chest and sing songs celebrating victory for us?

Like the river water, flow eastward, petrels yearning for the sea, rushing out of the foggy valley, calling for the victory of the battle...

### Beard

— Si Quan

I have recently developed a habit, which may be a very bad habit. But in middle age, although there is no obvious aging, I can never push the days back and not change my life in my youth at all. Especially for someone as silent and unsociable as me, who was already praised as having an "adult look" in childhood. In middle age, I really feel like I have lived too long. The troubles of life have honed away my lively spirit, and I only feel that I am too old. The formation of that habit is probably not without relationship. That habit is to like to be silent alone, using my fingers to stroke the beard under my chin. That beard, because it was shaved with a safety razor every day for a while, has now become hard and rough. It stings my fingers slightly. But in that slight pain, I feel a kind of inexplicable pleasure and satisfaction.

That habit was developed after coming here to be a teacher to the children. Speaking of which, half of it is due to him, that is, the safety razor was suddenly lost, and there is no such consumable item for sale here. To shave, you have to go to the barber shop. The barber shops here are as simple as they can be, and the barber's skills are so clumsy that cutting a "Western-style haircut" is a very difficult task in their eyes. I remember the first time I went to get a haircut, when they saw it was a "Western-style haircut", they specially asked a barber they called "old master" to take on this task, but I would rather sacrifice my "Western-style haircut" and finally came out with my head shaved. So, who would be willing to endure that "punishment of God" just to get a shave?

So, let those stiff beards grow under my chin, and unconsciously developed this habit.

Sure enough, having a beard makes one look a bit older. It is said that a teacher of children should have that kind of majesty. None of the teachers here are younger than me. There are three who officially keep beards. Unlike me, who is too lazy to get a haircut and let them spread around my mouth like thatch, the mouth corners above the lips are cut into very beautiful figure-eight shapes, and the chin is also very neat. When stroking it with the index finger and thumb, it is indeed awe-inspiring.

Those majestic teachers also suggested to me that instead of letting it grow in such a mess, it is better to officially grow a beard and keep it in a style. Afterwards, just use small scissors to trim it slightly, and you can always maintain that state. Perhaps I am really old. After listening to their proposal, I really wanted to officially grow a beard. Indeed, it would be less trouble, but wouldn't it be better to be more majestic? After discussing it with myself several times, I decided to grow a beard. Although there are no good barbers here, there are several experts in trimming beards.

On the third day of growing my beard, I was accidentally happy and went to the playground to watch the students play with a ball after school. One child was sitting in the corner of the wall crying. That was a common thing. The children simply wouldn't hesitate to cry for a game of ball. So I majestically found a slightly older child and asked him. He didn't know. I found a second one, but he still didn't know. There was no way. I picked up the child, coaxed him not to cry, and asked him who bullied him. The child looked at my face, cried even harder, stubbornly squatted down, and ran away, ran so fast.

Later, another child told me the reason he ran away: he was afraid of my beard, saying that it was like the Earth God and must not be a good person. This made me understand why none of the children went to play in the rooms of my three bearded colleagues.

Now I regret it. Children don't like old people. I should be young, not even looking like an "adult". I want every child to like me, just like I like them.

Youth is precious!

How did you come to the imperial state alone? Husband, since we parted, we encountered famine. Parents-in-law died one after another. Hearing a word. Tears in both lines. Crying sadly, Cai Zhonglang.

Passionate but always foolish. Unfortunate beauty has been said since ancient times. I, Huixian, lost my parents in childhood and had no support. Lonely adopted daughter-in-law to the Lu family. The betrothal of cousins ​​was originally righteous. The family happily spent their time. Even more happy that my cousin's feelings are also deep. Murmuring small words warm words. I only hate, the nun Bukong is greedy for alms. I only regret, I politely dissuaded and gave her to the deep enemy. The hairpin Phoenix, is it intentional to fall apart? Causing extraordinary disasters. Instigation is nothing but revenge. The world can kill the nun. Slander entered the mother and harmed the slave. Suffering all kinds of hardships and carrying the burden. The mother-in-law's anger did not subside and her heart changed even more. She actually made me, alone in the empty door, suffer bullying. The evil nun once lured me into a lowly profession. To guard my chastity, I vowed not to obey. How did my good man know that he went to the exam far away? A thousand kinds of sorrow, who can I confide in? Although my husband returned and saw me. Even more sad. The lotus flowers are hard to form. Alas. How can I bear to read the broken intestines? Alas, tears wet the silk kerchief drop by drop. Alas, thinking about the past and the future, it is difficult to fall asleep. Alas, tossing and turning all night, I can't sleep peacefully. Alas, my haggard face is afraid to face the mirror. Alas, I have become ill from lying in bed. Alas, the Kun string should be continued and reminded again. Alas, the mother-in-law called me after I died and recovered. I can't greet you in the morning and evening. I would like to unfold my frowning eyebrows for the time being. You must forgive my unfilial name. I sigh that my karmic relationship was determined in my previous life. Why bother to blame others for the torment? I only hope that heaven knows my intentions. Life 　 Gatherings and separations are originally floating. I am willing to close my eyes and go to the underworld.

### "New Life Song"

One of the songs in "New Year's Money"

There are seven songs interspersed in the upcoming Mingxing film "New Year's Money": Hu Rongrong sings "New Year's Money", "Bird in a Cage", Gong Qiuxia sings "Happy New Year", "Volcanic Landscape", Li Minghui sings "Dance Hall Song", Yao Ping sings "New Year Song", Li Lilian sings "New Life Song". These singers are all good at singing, and they have achieved good results in assisting the atmosphere of the development of the whole play.

Among the seven songs, the first six are of the "decadent music" type. The last "New Life Song" by Li Lilian is a majestic and inspiring patriotic song. She leads a group of innocent elementary school students to sing loudly, and the sound waves spread to everyone's eardrums, which can't help but arouse a patriotic upsurge and echo the singing loudly. - This symbolizes that the Chinese nation has awakened from the drunken dream of "decadent music" and created a new life.

The author of "New Life Song" is He Luting. The lyrics are recorded as follows:

Here there is the edge of a sword, there is the sound of iron, here there are free people, there is a solid Great Wall. Here there is resonance, there is unity, here there is your infinite future, there is my guiding light, here there is progress, here there is no decline, here there is progress, no decline!"

### Bai Lu and Han Lagen "A Match Made in Heaven"

### Xinhua News

Diao Banhua was very excited about starring in "Night Rain in Xiaoxiang". The plot of the play is tortuous. Diao Banhua cried a lot today and laughed wildly tomorrow. She has been filming for days and is moody. Diao said that filming is very funny.

"Song at Midnight" is in a hurry to end. Jin Youwei said that if this film continues to be filmed, his face will be broken. Every time he films, he must put on makeup as a weirdo, and after filming, he must wash his face with Geslin, which is really not easy to enjoy.

"Youth March" has already started auspiciously. Shi Dongyou has put in unprecedented effort for this play. After receiving the script, the heroine Hu Ping studied it at home for a week, declined all social engagements, and did not leave the house. At the same time, all parties attached great importance to "Youth March".

"Soaring Ambition" is scheduled to be shown on New Year's Day at the Capital Grand Theater in Nanjing and the Central and South City Theaters in Shanghai. In Nanjing, national defense films will definitely receive special attention.

Chen Juanjuan participates in "Night Rain in Xiaoxiang", playing the daughter of Diao Banhua Jin You, and has an important performance.
