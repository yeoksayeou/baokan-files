### Japan's Diplomacy Towards China Still Holds to the Hirota Three Principles

Special Emphasis on Economic Advancement: Smuggling and Tax Reduction are Inseparable.  Kawagoe Arrives in China with New Instructions.

[Tokyo] It is heard that the nature of the instructions given by the Konoe Cabinet to Ambassador to China Kawagoe are as follows: The Hirota Three Principles remain the starting point of the policy towards China. Japan maintains its desire for the current state of tranquility in Sino-Japanese relations and will, for the time being, refrain from strongly forcing China to immediately implement the Three Principles. Otherwise, new disputes that could block the positive effect of adjusting the relationship between the two countries might arise.  Therefore, Japan's policy will place greater emphasis on economic advancement in China.  According to reports from here, the general procedure for Japanese negotiations with China is as follows: ㊀ Regarding negotiations on various pending issues, Japan plans to start with a certain important transportation problem, and it is heard that Japan has already made preparations on this issue. Regarding the North China smuggling problem, Japan insists that it cannot be separated from the issue of reducing Chinese tax rates. If China expresses its willingness, Japan will consider solutions. ㊁ The Hebei-Chahar Political Council will still be the object of negotiations regarding railway construction and the exploitation of iron, coal, and other mines. Judging from the above two points, Foreign Minister Hirota's policy towards China is no different from before. The so-called "new understanding of China" is merely a superficial term. Observers interested in adjusting Sino-Japanese relations express pessimism about Foreign Minister Hirota's policy. Sino-Japanese relations under the young Prime Minister may not be much different from those under the previous four cabinets. (20th, Chung Chu News Agency dispatch)

[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Hirota consulted with the Army and Navy authorities on the current cabinet's policy towards China. The opinions of the three parties were completely consistent. Therefore, it was decided to urge Ambassador to China Kawagoe to return to his post recently in order to carry out the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations. Once the ambassador has completed consultations with all parties, it is planned that he will depart from Tokyo for China on the 24th. It is also heard that the core of the newly established policy toward China is to attach importance to continuing the relatively stable state currently existing between the two countries and to make efforts to prevent new disputes from arising. At the same time, Japan's attitude towards China seems to show some signs of retreat, which should be corrected. An autonomous attitude will be adopted to gradually unfold the situation in Sino-Japanese relations. (20th, Domei News Agency dispatch)

[Tokyo] Prime Minister Konoe said that his meeting with Army Minister Sugiyama was to listen to the situation in North China and Manchuria-Mongolia, and there were no urgent issues or prerequisites for any actions. As for meeting with Foreign Minister Hirota, it was to discuss diplomatic issues and listen to the recent opinions of the Navy, but he did not intend to convene the Four Ministers Conference of the Hirota Cabinet to review diplomatic issues.

### Asahi Shimbun Comments on Foreign Minister Wang's Remarks

[Tokyo] This morning's Asahi Shimbun editorial is entitled "Expectations for the Konoe Cabinet's Foreign Policy." It first comments on Foreign Minister Wang's remarks to Japanese reporters, saying, "Mr. Wang Chonghui's clear and insightful remarks indicate that the solution of Sino-Japanese political problems is a prerequisite for the solution of all Sino-Japanese problems. This proves that China's attitude has not changed at all. These remarks were published when Ambassador Kawagoe was about to return to his post with new instructions, intending to make Japan reconsider." Mr. Wang Chonghui seems to share Konoe's observations on China. Mr. Wang did not mention that Hirota was the initiator of the Three Principles, but welcomed Hirota as the advocate of non-aggression and hoped that a new era in Sino-Japanese relations could be opened under the cooperation of Konoe and Hirota. The newspaper then quoted and criticized several of Konoe's previous remarks to Japanese reporters, saying, "If Konoe does not change his views, there is little hope for China and Japan to become closer, because the scope of Konoe's policy toward China is extremely narrow. Furthermore, if the new instructions issued to Ambassador Kawagoe are too far from China's hopes, it is better to hold informal talks instead of formal negotiations. Although the purpose of formal negotiations is to bring the two countries closer, they may lead to adverse results." The newspaper concluded, "Now is the best opportunity to adjust Sino-Japanese relations. On the Japanese side, Kawagoe's return date should be extended for the sake of reconsidering methods to find points of agreement acceptable to both China and Japan. However, China should also refrain from further inciting anti-Japanese sentiment. We sincerely hope that all Sino-Japanese issues should be negotiated on the principles of equality and mutual benefit and in a spirit of mutual concession, thereby creating a good atmosphere to realize a new era in Sino-Japanese relations. The meaning of this editorial is quite profound." (20th, Central News Agency dispatch)

### The Central Government Reforms the Currency System in Guangdong Province

Stipulating 1.44 as the Legal Ratio; Song Ziwen Issues an Order in the Name of the Ministry of Finance

[Guangzhou] In order to complete the unification of the currency system and ensure the security of finance in Guangdong Province, Song Ziwen came to Guangdong and issued an order in the name of the Ministry of Finance at 5:00 pm on the 20th to reform the currency system in Guangdong Province, setting 1.44 as the legal ratio of hao coins to legal tender. The original order is as follows: "In August of last year, in order to reorganize the Guangdong currency and stabilize exchange rates, this ministry presented a proposal to issue 12 million yuan in Guangdong financial consolidation bonds, which was approved, to supplement the reserve for hao coins, and two sets of provisional measures were presented and approved, stipulating that the ratio of hao coins to legal tender shall not exceed an increase of five points. Since the announcement and implementation, the exchange rate of hao coins has been extremely stable, which has never happened before. Prices have also stabilized, and the financial economy has become active. Industry and commerce have also recovered. A fixed ratio should be determined to complete the unification of the currency system. Therefore, the following measures are stipulated: ㊀ Starting from January 1, 1938, all public and private funds in Guangdong Province, as well as the collection and payment of all sales transactions and the signing of various contracts, shall be based on the national currency. If hao coins are used for collection, payment, or signing again, it will be legally invalid. ㊁ The total amount of hao coins issued by the Guangdong Provincial Bank and the Guangzhou Municipal Bank up to June 19 of this year is 33,784,900 yuan. Starting from June 21, it will be converted into national currency at a legal ratio of 1.44. It will continue to be used as usual at the ratio before the end of this year, but national currency delivered at the legal ratio shall not be refused. Violators will be severely punished. ㊂ Starting from today, the hao coins issued by the Guangdong Provincial Bank and the Guangzhou Municipal Bank will be gradually exchanged and destroyed for national currency by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Guangdong Provincial Bank in accordance with the legal ratio. ㊃ The Guangzhou branch of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee shall maintain a proportional cash reserve at any time for the hao coins that have not yet been recovered. The above measures shall be communicated to the Guangdong Pacification Director's Office, the Guangdong Provincial Government, and the Guangzhou Municipal Government for widespread announcement, and reported to the Executive Yuan for record, and telegraphed separately for compliance. Attached is the Implementation Measures for Reforming the Currency System in Guangdong Province: ㊀ The Guangzhou branch of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee shall announce the total amount of hao coins issued as of June 19 of this year and the total amount of various cash reserves on June 21 of this year. ㊁ After the total amount of hao coins issued is announced, no more shall be issued. ㊂ Starting from June 21 of this year, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications shall send the hao coins redeemed to the Guangzhou branch of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee for transfer on a daily basis. The cash reserve shall be transferred to the accounts of the respective banks by the public association based on the actual cash component in the treasury. The guarantee reserve that should be replenished shall be replenished with the Guangdong financial consolidation public bonds. The cash that has not been transferred shall be the reserve for the actual circulating hao coins in the market, which shall be managed by the Guangzhou branch of the Issuance Reserve Custody Committee, which is responsible for its management. ㊃ The hao coins redeemed by the Guangdong Provincial Bank shall be sent to the Guangzhou branch of the Central Bank for summary and transferred to the branch of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee on a daily basis. ㊄ The Guangzhou branch of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications shall report the number of hao coins redeemed and the amount of cash reserve transferred on a daily basis to their respective headquarters, which shall forward them to the Issuance Reserve Management Committee for reporting to the Ministry of Finance. ㊅ The Guangzhou branch of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee shall report the number of hao coins redeemed and the amount of cash reserve transferred on a daily basis to the Issuance Reserve Management Committee, and the branch shall publish the number of hao coins redeemed in Guangzhou newspapers every half month. ㊆ After each announcement of the number of hao coins redeemed, the Guangzhou branch of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee shall cut off the corner of the coin and send a part of the corner to the Guangdong Provincial Bank for record and report to the Guangdong Provincial Government for record. The corners cut off shall be sent to the Issuance Reserve Management Committee at the end of each month for verification and reporting to the Ministry." (20th, Central News Agency dispatch)

[Hong Kong] Song Ziwen reconvened a meeting of important figures in the banking community at the Central Bank branch at 8:00 am on the 20th. Zeng Saifu, Xu Jingtang, and Huang Qiang all participated. The meeting lasted until 12:00 noon, discussing the following scope: ㊀ Reforming the Guangdong currency system; ㊁ The ratio of large and small silver coins; ㊂ The collection and storage methods of silver; ㊃ Stabilizing the financial plan; ㊄ Developing Qiongya's mineral resources and industry, and developing transportation, building a circular railway in Hainan, opening ports, etc. All exchanged detailed opinions. Song will gather the opinions of all parties after consulting with Yu and Wu, and submit them to the Central Government for approval. Before approval, strict confidentiality will be maintained. Since Song arrived in Guangdong, rumors have spread that the ratio of Guangdong coins to silver dollars will be reduced, so Guangdong coins have soared and Hong Kong paper has fallen to plus 485, and Shanghai paper has also fallen to plus 46, breaking this year's record. (20th, Special Dispatch)

### Mr. Song Ziwen Issues a Statement

[Guangzhou] Song Ziwen met with reporters from the Central News Agency at the Central Bank on the 20th and issued a statement on the Ministry of Finance's order to unify the currency system, saying, "Our country's currency has always been complex. Since the abolition of taels and the change to yuan, and after the implementation of legal tender, currencies in various places have tended to be unified. However, Guangdong Province has always been accustomed to using hao coins and silver dollars. Although it changed to the central system at the same time as the central government in November of the 24th year, it failed to achieve consistency because it used hao coins. Moreover, at that time, because the political situation was not unified, the exchange rate of Guangdong coins to national currency fluctuated without certainty. Guangdong has suffered the hardship of unstable currency. In July of the 25th year, the political situation was unified, and the central government reorganized the Guangdong government, first focusing on reorganizing the currency system. The reorganization steps should first stabilize the value of the original currency. After it is effective, it will be changed to national currency to achieve unification. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance specifically formulated two measures in August of last year. Since the implementation, the currency value has been stable and unchanged, and the economic situation in Guangdong Province has become increasingly active, which is enough to prove that the initial stage has been successful. Now it has reached a considerable period, and it is necessary to proceed with the second step and change to national currency. President Chiang is very concerned about this issue and has carefully studied it with the relevant authorities and economic experts, and has decided to actively implement the unified currency plan. All hao coins issued by the Guangdong and Guangzhou banks will be gradually recovered for national currency at the plus ratio before the end of this year. The market price of Guangdong coins and national currency is often around 1.5. Maintaining it for up to nine months, prices have been relatively stable during this process. However, due to the impact of the soaring prices before the unification of the political situation, although it is stable, it is still slightly higher than other places. In addition, world and national prices are also rising. At this time, the ratio of Guangdong coins is determined to be fixed, so that prices can be slightly balanced. Guangdong is a rice-deficient province, and it has always relied on foreign and other provinces for supply. In this way, it is also more beneficial to the people's food, and the people's burden can be reduced. However, if the currency value is too high, it may hinder economic development. Now the ratio is set to plus 44, which is a balanced choice. From now on, the currency system in Guangdong Province will be uniformly based on national currency. From then on, the national currency will be unified, and it will not be different due to the Guangdong anomaly. The financial organization will become more sound, and the circulation of the commercial market will become more stable." (20th, Central News Agency dispatch)

[Hong Kong] Qu Shounian is scheduled to return to Guilin on the 21st to report to Li Bai on the process of returning to Song. Gan Jihou will remain in Guangdong to negotiate with Song. (20th, Special Dispatch)

### Overseas Chinese from Fujian Visit Si Lie in Beijing

[Nanjing] Yang Hansun and other overseas Chinese from Fujian who returned to Beijing visited Si Lie, Director of the Department of Finance of Fujian Province, on the 20th, taking advantage of his visit to Beijing, because the 50-cent and 20-cent auxiliary coins issued by the Fujian Provincial Bank have reached more than 10 million. They requested 1. Please recover the amount exceeding the limit set by the Ministry of Finance. 2. Please announce the amount of bonds issued and the exact amount of the reserve fund. 3. Unify the auxiliary coin paper to prevent counterfeiting. Si replied that the total amount of auxiliary coin bonds set by the ministry was indeed 2 million yuan, but after considering local needs, 5 million yuan was additionally issued, totaling 7 million yuan. The reserve fund was originally 1 million yuan, but later he borrowed 1.5 million yuan from the Shanghai financial community, totaling 2.5 million yuan. The additional 5 million yuan exceeding the amount set by the ministry is being submitted to the ministry for approval and recognition. In the future, if it is not approved, it will be recovered immediately to comply with the law. As for the printing paper for the coin bonds, it can be submitted to the ministry for separate printing to replace the old bonds to achieve unification. (20th, Special Dispatch)

Last year, police chiefs from various provinces and cities came to Beijing for training and initiated the organization of this association. Not only do European and American countries have this organization within their own countries, but there is also this kind of connection internationally, in order to prevent criminals from fleeing to other countries and plotting conspiracies. Now that this association has been established, it will be of great benefit to Chinese police administration. Representatives from the Central Civil Training Department, Guo Weizi, the Ministry of the Interior, Wen Juntian, and the Municipal Party Department, Peng Erkang, etc., then delivered speeches in succession. Then the chairman announced the articles of association, and finally the directors and supervisors were elected. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. (20th, Central News Agency dispatch)

### The Xingzhong Company Plans to Absorb the Changlu Salt Area

Raising a Capital of 500,000 [Yuan] to Induce Beach Salt Producers to Borrow

[Tianjin] The Salt Affairs Office of the Xingzhong Company, in order to absorb the Changlu salt area, specifically established the Tongji Money and Grain Affairs Office in Saisang Village, Hangu, with a capital of 500,000 [yuan] to lend externally. Beach salt producers who wish to borrow only need to use their beach or salt production as collateral, without other procedures. Established for two months, few Changlu salt producers have inquired. Recently, the office has changed its regulations, not requiring collateral, only requiring the beach salt producers to sign a contract to borrow the money. It also urged Shao Jingyin, manager of Lufeng Stores, to serve as chairman, but Shao declined. However, Xingzhong's ambition to covet Changlu salt fields has not ceased. Xingzhong still has 130,000 tons of Changlu salt purchased and transported this year without a signed contract. Recently, it repeatedly urged Lufeng Stores to sign the contract. The store turned to discuss with the beach salt producers and decided on two methods to respond to the Japanese side: 1. Continue to accept the original sales contract in principle, but only if there is surplus salt after the autumn drying can it be transported out; 2. The price of the first batch of salt was too low, and the donations and losses were too great. If you want to continue purchasing, you must increase the value. (20th Special Telegram)

### British Merchant and Son Drown While Boating Off Yantai

British Warships and Aircraft Search Extensively; Bodies of the Two Are Nowhere to Be Found

[Yantai] A strange case occurred in the sea here this afternoon. The deceased were Englishman Leyton and his son Eric. This morning at 11:00, Leyton and his wife, along with Mrs. Crossland and her son Tony, age 12, and Eric, age 8, took a motorboat for a picnic. Upon returning, Eric's hat blew into the sea. His father then circled the boat, causing Eric to fall into the sea from the boat. Mrs. Leyton hurriedly jumped into the water to save her son. Seeing this, Leyton, fearing that the adults could not cope, immediately stopped the motor and also jumped into the sea. At the time, Mrs. Crossland threw a chair into the water to help them. Mrs. Leyton grabbed it and avoided sinking, while Eric and his father both drowned, probably because Eric hugged his father's neck too tightly. At that time, the American warship Beckos dispatched a lifeboat to assist in the rescue, although Mrs. Leyton was rescued, the father and son had already drifted away. This happened around 3:00 pm. Afterwards, naval vessels and aircraft searched extensively for the bodies of the two, but no trace was found. At that time, the wind rose on the beach, greatly hindering the rescue work. It is reported that Leyton's father was a highly respected businessman in Yantai and along the Chinese coast. He had only this one son. (20th Central News Agency Telegram)

### Prime Minister Konoe's Statement on the Current Situation

Japanese and Puppet Economies Become One; Reform of the House of Peers Aims to Be Realized

[Tokyo] Prime Minister Konoe went to Hakone yesterday afternoon for a weekend rest, staying at the Fujiya Hotel. Regarding the current issues, he spoke as follows:

㊀ The basic tone of the budget preparation for the next fiscal year should first be based on the three principles of finance and economy decided by the Cabinet, to integrate Japan and Manchukuo and base it on a comprehensive planned economy, in order to coordinate national defense and finance. Under this policy, it will be handled jointly in accordance with the "Manchukuo" five-year plan. The Planning Board is currently studying specific plans and intends to present a part of it to the next regular Diet session, reflected in the budget.

㊁ Regarding the reform of the House of Peers, preparations will begin after the completion of the special Diet session. I personally believe that the hereditary nobility members of the House of Peers have always been its central force. This focus on the social status of the nobility when the House was founded is no longer in line with the times, and the political situation is also complex and diverse. Therefore, the hereditary nobility-centered doctrine should be broken, and experts with knowledge and experience should be the central force. The House of Representatives should pay attention to common sense, while the House of Peers should draw on experts, so that it has the function of criticism and supervision. The two houses should complement each other to promote the effectiveness of parliamentary politics. This is the main point of reforming the House of Peers. The extent to which it can be achieved is a problem for the future. Efforts will be made to bring it closer to this ideal and to create a concrete plan. As for the goals of the reform, the fixed number of peers with titles should be reduced, and the system of multi-member seats should also be reconsidered. In addition, the views of functional representatives should be increased to a certain extent at the same time as imperial appointments. However, I personally do not approve of a system that only grants seats to meritorious nobles.

㊂ Regarding the reorganization of political parties, I would strongly support it if the parties sincerely request reorganization. As for the new party issue, there is currently no consideration. If the government puts forward a concrete plan for reform policies, it is still unknown whether the Zhengmin and Minsheng parties can maintain their current stance. However, depending on the situation, it may be possible to create a new party, which is difficult to predict at this time. (20th Allied Press Telegram)

### The Future of the Spanish War After the Fall of Bilbao

— Fu

Bilbao, the capital of the Basque Autonomous Region, which had been besieged by rebel forces for several months, fell the day before yesterday. This is, of course, a very important development in the history of the Spanish Civil War. The Basque region is an important area in northern Spain with very rich mineral resources and a very developed commercial sector. This time, the rebel forces used all their strength to besiege Bilbao, and Franco personally went to the front line to command and was determined to win, precisely because Bilbao has major significance in politics, economy, and military affairs.

There are two important reasons for the fall of Bilbao this time. One is the active assistance from Germany and Italy to the rebel forces. The other is the infighting within the Spanish government forces. German and Italian aid to the rebels began after the outbreak of the Spanish War. However, in the past several battles, the German and Italian volunteers were often defeated by the government forces. In particular, the major defeat of the Italian volunteers on the Guadalajara front north of Madrid in early March was the most important. Therefore, in this war to besiege Bilbao, the rebel forces were extremely well-prepared, with Germany and Italy supplying large numbers of bombers and pilots. At the same time, the attacking troops were also equipped with modern mechanized weapons. Therefore, after the attack, although the Basque army resisted bravely, their "Iron Ring Defense Line" was finally breached in the middle of last week. Yesterday, the city of Bilbao also fell into the hands of the rebel forces. Therefore, the fall of Bilbao this time can really be said to be the power of Germany and Italy. On the 17th, the Italian "People's Newspaper" published an article (said to be written by Mussolini) which was very indignant about the previous failure of the Italian army on the Guadalajara front, and said that this hatred would surely be avenged. However, it was not clear when, where, and how this hatred would be avenged. The fall of Bilbao this time is probably the victory of the Italian revenge action.

Secondly, the infighting within the Spanish government is also an important reason for the fall of Bilbao. The Spanish government is composed of various parties of the People's Front, and the internal composition is quite complex. In particular, the attitude of the anarchists is the greatest obstacle to cooperation. The Catalonia riot and the reorganization of the Valencia government were all caused by their challenging attitude. Because of the infighting within the government forces, the rebel forces were able to mobilize a large number of troops to attack the Basque capital. Although the government forces repeatedly sent troops to attack the rebel forces in the Aragon region, temporarily to resolve the crisis in the north, they were unsuccessful because of the defection of the anarchists. As a result, the rebel forces were able to concentrate their strength and capture Bilbao.

The fall of Bilbao is certainly very unfavorable to the position of the Spanish government forces. However, the second reason for the Basque army's defeat mentioned above no longer exists. Because the Spanish government has been reorganized, the power of the anarchists has been suppressed, and Ning (Min), the leader of the Trotskyists, who had a strong anti-government tendency, has also been arrested. In the future, the government forces will be able to use a more organized and solid front to counterattack the advance of the fascist forces. However, in the international arena, the recent establishment of the Anglo-French-German-Italian monitoring agreement has made German and Italian intervention even bolder. This is very unfavorable to the situation of the Spanish government forces. Therefore, it is still too early to talk about the end of the Spanish War. And the government forces still have to go through a very difficult struggle to achieve the final victory. However, this final victory will always belong to the Spanish people's government, because parties that violate the will of the people and use external forces to seize power are bound to fail one day.

### Soviet Aviators Land in Vancouver

Traveling More Than 8,000 Miles in Fifty Hours; Unprecedented Trans-Arctic Achievement

⊙Portland Soviet aviators Chkalov, Badaakov, and Belyakov, who departed from Moscow at 2:00 pm (Greenwich Time) on the 18th of this month, flew over the North Pole at 9:30 pm on the same day, and landed in Wenchanhua City, Washington State, in the northwestern United States at 4:25 pm today (about 1,000 kilometers from San Francisco), having flown a total of 8,600 kilometers, taking a total of 50 hours and 25 minutes, with an average speed of about 170 kilometers per hour. When they reached the west coast of Canada, their speed dropped to 135 kilometers per hour due to headwinds. According to reports, the purpose of this trip was to fly directly from Moscow to San Francisco, a distance of 9,600 kilometers, in order to test the direct flight between Russia and the United States across the Arctic, as a preparation for opening a regular commercial airline. The Soviet authorities have been planning this matter for more than a day. A test flight was once conducted in 1935, but it was abandoned halfway due to mechanical problems with the aircraft. If this flight can complete the entire journey, it would be enough to break the non-stop long-distance flight record created by French aviators Rossi and Codos (9,103 kilometers) and become a great feat in the aviation industry. Although they landed in Vancouver, USA, it is still an unprecedented record for direct trans-Arctic travel to the United States. This may have a significant impact on the political and economic affairs of Russia and the United States, and on the Pacific military strategy. (Central News Agency 20th Watt Electric)

[New York] The military radio station in Seattle, northern, recently received a radio message from the three Soviet aviators at 12:45 pm today (Greenwich Time), stating that they were now 640 kilometers south of Scott Point on Vancouver Island, and that the speed had been reduced to 135 kilometers per hour due to headwinds. The United Airlines company is currently sending telegrams to the aviators, instructing them on the route to fly over the ocean to the mainland. (Central News Agency 20th Havas Telegram)

[Moscow] One of the personnel in the Moscow-Arctic-North America non-stop flight, Soviet hero Belyakov, wrote in detail about the planned steps for this flight. According to the full text published by Pravda, "From Moscow to the Arctic, we will follow 38 degrees east longitude, and from the Pole to the United States, we will follow 123 degrees west longitude. These two longitudes are the axis of our route, but due to climate and other conditions, we may have to make slight changes at any time. When we fly over the Barents Sea, we plan to fly from the Kola Peninsula to the west coast of the Franz Josef Islands. We will fly at an altitude of about 1,300 meters above the sea. We expect to obtain radio instructions from the drifting Arctic station to determine the direction of flying to the North Pole. The section from the Pole to the North American coast is about 2,000 kilometers long. It is one of the most important and difficult sections of our entire journey. The situation here is extremely unfamiliar, and it is not easy to determine the direction near the magnetic pole.

"The next section is from the northern coast of Canada to the Rocky Mountains, which is quite similar to northern Soviet Union. First, we will fly over the tundra, then the vast forest zone and marshland. The branches of the Rocky Mountains start on the west bank of the Mackenzie River, but since we are flying south along 123 degrees east longitude, most of the mountains will be on our right. At that time, we can fly smoothly for more than 1,500 kilometers without encountering high mountains. However, after crossing the Makee River, we will have to fly over mountains and ridges, which is one of the most difficult tasks, and the crew will be quite tired at that time. After crossing the ridge to West Chitu, if the weather is not good, we can fly along the Pacific coast, over the ocean, and the altitude can be adjusted at will.

"Our task is to fly non-stop directly to North America. The government has ordered that we should land on the ground as much as possible when necessary. However, if there is enough fuel and the weather is suitable, we will try our best to fly further," he said. (19th TASS Telegram)

In the afternoon, at 6:00 PM, all shops in the city closed to celebrate. A large group of people held a rally in front of the municipal office, where the mayor, appointed by the National Army, gave a speech, roughly saying, "Spaniards, our army has now entered the port of Bilbao.

Running from Shelters into the Forest in the Black of Night; Utterly Hating the Instigators of the Civil War

[London] A shelter for Spanish Basque refugee children is located near Southampton, England. Last night, 500 children in the shelter, upon hearing the alarming news of the fall of Bilbao, suddenly acted as if possessed, rushing out of the shelter and into the nearby forest. Some carried iron knives from the dining table. Rescue teams, along with the police, rushed to the area and found 350 of the disaster-stricken children. The whereabouts of the remaining 190 are still unknown. Rescue teams are currently searching through the night with torches. (Central News Agency, 20th, Reuters dispatch) After searching all night, all the children have been found.

### Using the Attack on the Cruiser as an Excuse, Germany Launches a Diplomatic Offensive

### The French Financial Full Powers Bill Faces Opposition from the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies

The Fate of the Cabinet is in Jeopardy; The Left Wing Forms a Compromise Plan

[Paris] The French Senate rejected the government's financial full powers bill last night by a vote of 188 to 72 and passed a new bill drafted by the Senate Finance Committee. According to this proposal, French Prime Minister Blum only has limited powers to cope with the current economic and financial difficulties. Therefore, the Senate's move is a major blow to the government. However, the Chamber of Deputies, which passed the full powers bill on Monday, expressed sympathy for the government when considering the Senate amendments. The Radical Socialist Party and the Communist Party deputies in the Chamber of Deputies unanimously supported Blum, rejecting the Senate amendments by a vote of 346 to 248 and passing the original bill for the second time. The bill has now been sent to the Senate for reconsideration. The fate of the government depends solely on the Senate's decision. If the full powers bill is rejected by the Senate again, then the Prime Minister will have no choice but to resign or ask the President to dissolve Parliament. (Central News Agency, 20th, Reuters dispatch)

[Paris] Regarding the financial full powers bill, the differences between the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate have almost reached a stalemate, and the fate of the current cabinet is in jeopardy. However, the political situation has greatly improved and people in political circles are thus more optimistic, because the delegations from the various left-wing parties, including all the parties belonging to the Popular Front, held a meeting this morning to discuss the issue and have now formed a compromise plan, which states that during the current session, and at most before July 31 of this year, Parliament will specially authorize the government to enact various measures by decree, after consulting with the Council of State, in order to (1) prevent and punish all acts that harm public credit; (2) the government may, within the scope of the British, French, and American monetary agreements, try to maintain the franc, but may not implement exchange controls; (3) revive finance and protect the interests of savings account holders, but the government may not add personnel or increase expenditures for the central government and various provinces and cities, may not forcibly convert public bonds or forcibly adjust private debts, may not increase customs import tax rates, and may not restrict the trading of securities. As for private enterprises, except for those previously stipulated in writing, the scope of control may not be expanded. This compromise plan was drafted by the secretary-general of the delegations from the various left-wing parties, namely Senator Schuman of the Socialist Party, together with various national political experts. It was submitted to the leaders of the largest party in the Senate, namely the left-wing Democratic Party, regardless of the cabinet members, including Mr. Audran and the Senate Finance Committee, for review, and they all believed that the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate could therefore reach a compromise.

He said that merchants and industrialists urgently need long-term contracts in order to implement ambitious plans. If countries with surplus capital cannot lend commercial loans to countries that need goods and raw materials, then world trade cannot develop normally. Therefore, international credit relations must also be improved. (National Seafarers Telegram, 20th)

### The Japanese Army School Decides to Expand

Extending the Age of Admission

[Tokyo] The army authorities, after carefully reviewing the development of the international situation, believe that the number of 1,000 personnel adopted by the former officers' school cannot meet the requirements of the National Army in terms of both quality and quantity. It has been decided to enrich and expand the school, increasing the number of personnel adopted to 2,200. Regarding the age limit, which was previously set at 16 to 20 years old, it has now been extended by two years, changed to 22 years old. The admission period, which was originally scheduled for April 1 next year, has now been brought forward to December 1 of this year.

(2) Ye privately transports large quantities of red earth from Hong Kong and Macau and mixes them with local products for sale in various places. (3) He plots to harm the country and the local area. The Hankou Opium Suppression Supervisory Office sent personnel to Fujian to investigate. The new family lives in Xiamen. On June 10, they arrived in the province from Xiamen and stayed at the YMCA. They were secretly monitored by detectives. On the night of the 11th, the Security Department and the Provincial Police Department first arrested Cheng Yunshan for questioning. At 4:00 AM on the 11th, seventeen people were arrested at the YMCA and the Yumin Company on Zhongting Street. They were all senior employees of the Yumin Company and important criminals. The company's books and important documents were seized. Ye was captured by a certain team. The Yumin Company's warehouse was sealed by personnel from the Provincial Police Department on the afternoon of the 12th. The Japanese Consul General stationed in Fuzhou requested the extradition of two Taiwanese, Mr. Chen and Mr. Wang, who were arrested at Baolixiang, but they were released. However, Chen and Wang are both confidants of Ye. In the direction of Xiamen, Ye's confidential secretary, Li Baohua, was captured on the evening of the 12th and escorted to the province on the 13th. The Yumin General Company, originally located in Xiamen, is also deserted and virtually paralyzed. The 70,000 yuan worth of opium paste stored there was moved to the Yongcheng Company, organized by Taiwanese opium paste in Xiamen, to offset the debts owed by Yumin. Ye's crimes have been exposed. In addition to the evidence seized regarding harming the country and the local area, the secret transportation of drugs and red earth was reported by Mr. Lin, who competed with Ye for the opium paste business, and the evidence is conclusive. Cheng Yunshan was detained because he was suspected of accepting a 40,000 yuan tea gift from Ye. After the case was exposed, Feng Yuwen, the Deputy Head of the Opium Suppression Supervision Office, resigned and fled. The Hankou Opium Suppression Supervisory Office immediately appointed Yu Huizhao as the Deputy Head and to act as the Head. Ye's Qinghe Villa on Lianpo Mountain in Heshan has been patrolled and monitored day and night by police detectives from the Heshan Special Zone Office, and all pedestrians are inspected. This case will be made public after the Supervisory Office sends personnel to thoroughly investigate and liquidate it. In addition to contracting for all the opium paste in the province, Ye Weihe has also formed a smuggling company to sell Western opium and manufacture morphine and other drugs, with a capital of 5 million yuan. Last year, Ye stayed in neighboring countries for several months and planned this matter. Taiwanese gentry such as Lin Guo and others have all invested in the company and hired two foreigners as consultants. Pirates are secretly hired to escort the goods along the coast. Mr. Lin of Jinmen is responsible for transferring the goods in. The smuggling route is from Rehe to Dalian and Tanggu for export, generally loaded on fishing boats. All transactions are conducted at sea, with Macau as the wholesale area. Mr. Ye and Zeng, Chen, and Zhang from Laiku Village in Hui'an are stationed in Macau to manage the warehouses. On May 22, two people came from Taiwan, first to Fuzhou, and then to Xiamen the next day, staying at a major hotel, where they secretly plotted with Ye. (June 19)

### Corruption Case of Officials in Hubei Provincial Government

Public Prosecution Initiated by the Court

Hankou Correspondence: The case of Wang Kaifa, Section Chief of the Secretariat of the Hubei Provincial Government, and Huang Shiluan, a staff member, for corruption has been submitted to the Wuchang District Court for investigation. Yesterday, Prosecutor Su Fengqi formally initiated a public prosecution, and the Criminal Court will hold a public trial in the near future. The indictment is disclosed in advance as follows:

Indictment of the Prosecutor of the Wuchang District Court of Hubei Province: "Defendant Huang Shiluan, male, 29 years old, from Yunnan Province, residing at No. 134 Zhongzheng Road; Wang Kaifa, male, 38 years old, from Fujian Province, residing at No. 14 in the middle section of Dachao Street, in custody. The right-listed defendant is prosecuted because the investigation of Case No. 1718 on embezzlement, theft, and forgery of seals in the 25th year of the Republic of China has been completed, and it is considered that a public prosecution should be initiated. The facts of the crime, the evidence, and the applicable laws are listed below. (1) Facts of the crime: Wang Kaifa, the defendant, was formerly the head of the receiving and dispatching section of the Hubei Provincial Government. Last year, due to a temporary urgent need for money, he privately misappropriated 2,000 yuan from the funds received from various counties to repay debts. Later, because the official documents could not be delayed for long, he used the later-received funds to offset the previously-received funds. As a result, he successively misappropriated and embezzled funds, totaling more than 3,000 yuan by February of this year. He was then discovered by his superiors, who recovered the funds and dismissed him from his position. Huang Shiluan, the defendant, first worked as a staff member in the receiving and dispatching room of the Provincial Government, and later served in the archives room. Seeing what Wang Kaifa had done, he also secretly stole a sealed document from the Yichang Business Tax Bureau received by He Xiaolong, a receiving and dispatching clerk, on April 2 and 16, containing a remittance of 2,688 yuan from the China Farmers Bank, as well as a document from Dangyang County containing 200 yuan in postal remittances for opium suppression. He forged the seal of the 'First Section, Second Division, Secretariat of the Hubei Provincial Government' and cashed out the two remittances separately. After the matter was discovered, the Provincial Government ordered the police department to send personnel to his home, where they successively seized 2,300 yuan in banknotes from the China Farmers Bank. The rest was used to repay debts and spend. After being handed over to the Security Department for interrogation along with Wang Kaifa, they were jointly sent to the High Court, which forwarded them for investigation. (2) Evidence and Applicable Laws: It has been verified that the defendants Wang Kaifa and Huang Shiluan have confessed to the aforementioned criminal facts. Their confessions are consistent with the interviews and written statements of the Provincial Government. Moreover, the sample of Huang Shiluan's forged seal of the 'First Section, First Division, Secretariat of the Hubei Provincial Government' has also been attached to the file by the Military Law Office of the Security Department. The evidence is conclusive. Although the defendant Wang Kaifa argued that 'from the perspective of the cause, it was originally borrowing money to repay debts, and there was no intention of illegal possession,' it is clear that he appropriated public funds to repay private debts, which is an intentional change of possession, and an economic disposition. It is unbelievable to claim that this is not an act of embezzlement. Even if he repaid all the funds and cleared the procedures afterward, it does not affect the establishment of the crime. Wang Kaifa's defense is difficult to justify. It is verified that his actions constitute a crime under Article 56 of the Criminal Law (i.e., if the same crime is committed by repeated acts, the punishment may be increased by up to one-half) and Article 336, Paragraph 1 (i.e., if a person possesses goods held by him in public office or for the public interest with the intention of illegal possession for himself, and embezzles items held by him belonging to others, he shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than one year and not more than seven years). Huang Shiluan repeatedly stole documents from various counties under the jurisdiction of He Xiaolong more than twice, and privately forged official seals to withdraw and spend the money. His actions constitute crimes under Article 320, Paragraph 1, Article 218, Paragraph 1, Article 55, and Article 56 of the Criminal Law, and his punishment shall be increased according to Article 134 of the same law (i.e., if a civil servant takes advantage of his power, opportunity, or method in office to intentionally commit crimes other than dereliction of duty, the punishment shall be increased by up to one-half). In accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is hereby initiated and sent for trial. Respectfully submitted to the Criminal Court of the same court. Prosecutor Su Fengqi, Clerk Shi Chuanying."

After this case occurred, the case of Liang Fangyin forging a private letter from Chairman Huang of the Provincial Government and affixing a forged private seal to deceive others is an unparalleled case. Liang is from Guangxi. Last year, he was sentenced to three months of imprisonment by the Wuchang District Court for forging documents and seals, and the sentence was served. In April of this year, he forged a private letter and seal of Chairman Huang, stating that he had recommended Yin to Chairman Chen of Fujian to be appointed as the Magistrate of Tong'an County. He used the letter to ask for money to raise funds for his trip, defrauding Mrs. Wu Tingyang, the Director of the Department of Construction, of more than 200 yuan. He also claimed to have been entrusted with errands and defrauded Liu Yingjie of more than 100 yuan and Jin Licheng of 10 yuan. After the Security Department learned about the matter, it consulted with the police department and arrested Liang and sent him to the Provincial Government for transfer to the High Court, which ordered the Hankou District Court to investigate. Liang confessed to the crime. Prosecutor Tang Shouren, based on the fact that Liang repeatedly committed the crime of using documents under Article 216 in conjunction with Article 210 of the Criminal Law, and repeatedly committed the crime under Article 239, Paragraph 1 of the same law, and increased the punishment according to Article 47 of the same law, initiated a public prosecution yesterday in accordance with Article 320, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

### Japanese Toyo Paper Company to Build Paper Mill in Tianjin

Capital of 10 Million, Paper to Be Produced Next Spring; Oji Paper Company Also Plans to Establish a Mill

Tianjin Correspondence: The Japanese Toyo Paper Company, which began preparations this spring to establish a factory in Tianjin, held a groundbreaking ceremony on the 11th of this month. The factory site is located in the Hai Shang Hui Dui Village in Tianjin. President Uchida, together with Takeuchi, the Tianjin factory manager, are in Tianjin supervising the construction progress. The entire factory covers an area of 150,000 "ping" (approximately 70 "ping" equals one Chinese "mu"). The civil engineering work is scheduled to be completed in September of this year, followed by the installation of machinery. It is planned to transport one large paper-making machine from the company's main factory in Japan, one 121-inch long steel machine, and two 113-inch round steel machines. The installation is expected to be completed by the end of the year, with trial runs in March of next spring and official paper production in April. The factory's electricity will be supplied by the Tianjin Electric Power Plant, a new joint venture between China and Japan. If it were not for waiting for the construction of the power plant and the connection of electricity, the Toyo Paper Factory might have started operations one or two months earlier. The total capital is 10 million Japanese yen. The company has independently purchased over 40,000 "mu" of land in the Changlu Salt Flats, abandoned salt mounds, and the areas of Hangu and Lutai to plant reeds as raw materials for papermaking. In addition, timber is also being procured from Fujian as another raw material for papermaking. The initial production capacity is 30 tons of reed-based paper and 25 tons of timber-based paper per day. The annual production capacity is expected to be 40 million sheets of newsprint and printing-grade paper. After one year, the situation will be assessed to determine further expansion. All products will be entrusted to Mitsubishi Corporation for sales. In the future, the factory intends to increase capital and monopolize the paper industry in North China and has the intention of transforming into a Sino-Japanese joint venture by incorporating Chinese capital. The emergence of this factory's products will have a significant impact on the cultural and news industries in North China. Although the Japanese Garrison Headquarters has not included this matter in the normal framework of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, it is an open secret that they are providing support and assistance behind the scenes and collaborating with the Japanese Consulate to help it grow.

In addition, there are two other Japanese paper companies planning to invest in North China. One is the Osaka Paper Company, with a planned capital of 5 million yuan. They sent personnel to Tianjin this spring to investigate and survey factory sites. However, due to the earlier plans and greater financial resources of the Toyo Paper Company, they considered themselves unable to compete and withdrew. They will reconsider construction after the Toyo Paper Company opens its factory and investigates whether North China still requires it. The other is the well-known Oji Paper Company in Osaka, which plans to invest 10 million yuan to establish a paper mill in either Tangshan or Shanhaiguan within the pseudo-area of eastern Hebei. They will cooperate with the Mitsui Business Department, imitating the cooperation model between Toyo Paper Company and Mitsubishi. They are currently conducting investigations and it is expected that it will soon materialize. (18th)

### Suzhou

Wenxin Printing House Destroyed by Fire

The Wenxin Printing House on Jingdezhen Road, the largest printing house in Suzhou, suddenly caught fire in the kitchen at 1:00 AM on the 20th. Due to the late hour, firefighting was difficult. The fire soon spread through the roof. Various fire brigades rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire after an hour. A total of 30 houses were destroyed. All except the accounting room were destroyed, resulting in a loss of assets and property worth approximately 100,000 yuan. The shop had 50,000 yuan of property insurance with Baolong and other insurance companies. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation by the authorities. The shop suffered a robbery two years ago in the West Central Market, and this is the second time it has suffered such a misfortune.

Soil Opium Peddler Jia Xuekun Arrested

Chen Ding, a patrolman from the Fourth Sub-station of the Second Police Station, arrested Jia Xuekun, a soil opium peddler, near the West City Bridge yesterday and seized over ten taels of soil opium. After being brought to the station, Jia confessed that he had purchased the soil opium from a private soil opium distribution center near the Nanyang Company in Shanghai some days ago and secretly brought it to Suzhou, entrusting a Yan in Daogian Street to find sales channels. He was immediately sent to the General Bureau and then transferred to the county government for interrogation.

### Wuxi

Hotels Compete for Business

There are five or six major hotels in the city, including the New World Hotel, Wuxi Hotel, Railway Hotel, and Washington Hotel. Last year, Yang Jingwei and other local gentry raised funds to build an International Hotel south of the railway station, which is larger in scale than the aforementioned hotels. Fearing a loss of business, the existing hotels have renovated their interiors in a lavish and magnificent manner to compete for business. Recently, another Rong is constructing a Central Hotel next to the International Hotel, having obtained more than ten "mu" of land from the Railway Bureau, with an estimated budget of over 100,000 yuan, including 30,000 yuan for construction costs and over 70,000 yuan for all equipment. The hotel will have five floors. The blueprint for the hotel has already been drawn up and construction is expected to begin soon.

### Zhenjiang

All County Budgets Approved

The general and detailed budgets for the 26th year of the Republic of China for all counties in Jiangsu Province have been fully approved. The last batch, including Zhenjiang, Pei County, Qingpu, Kunshan, Wu County, Jiading, and Nantong, were also approved by the provincial government meeting on the 18th. According to the general and detailed budgets for all counties in the province for the 26th year, the total is over 30 million yuan. The education and construction expenses of each county have increased compared to the previous year.

Counties to Re-establish Education Bureaus

Most of the education bureaus in Jiangsu Province were abolished and reorganized into sections after the 20th year of the Republic of China. Although some counties have since re-established education bureaus, the number is still small. As the education funding of each county has gradually become more abundant and educational undertakings have gradually become more burdensome, the provincial government's discussion meeting yesterday decided that all counties with education funding of over 80,000 yuan must re-establish education bureaus.

### Yuyao

Disaster in Yuyao's Three Townships Due to Moldy Rain

The three townships of Changdan, Nanlei, and Fengshan in Yuyao have recently suffered from continuous moldy rain, rising river tides, and sudden mountain floods. As a result, over 14,000 "mu" of early and late rice crops in the three townships have been submerged. Although the water has receded, the disaster has already occurred, and farmers are showing signs of worry. The county government has received telegrams from various township farmers' associations reporting the disaster and has sent personnel to the townships to investigate the disaster and plan for relief.

### Gaoyou

Request to Raise Canal Water Level

Recently, after the new wheat was put on the market, the grain market in the South Gate became active. However, because the canal water level is four or five feet lower than the lake water level, grain ships from all directions cannot enter the gate and mostly go to other places to sell, affecting the entire market. On the 17th, representatives of the grain industry went to the county chamber of commerce to petition. Chairman Wang Hongzao telegraphed the provincial government on their behalf, earnestly requesting the Guidance Committee to open the Huaiyin Gate water as much as possible, raise the canal water level, open the Jisheng Port, and open the Tonghu Gate to provide sufficient water sources to benefit farmland transportation.

### Huaiyin

Notorious Bandit Handed Over for Legal Handling

The notorious bandit Liu Jiluan recently hid in the northern gate of Suqian County, in the jurisdiction of this district, under the alias Liu Gaofeng. Wang Debo, the commissioner and security commander of the Seventh District of Jiangsu, received the information and specially dispatched Zhang Hongye, the magistrate of Suqian County, to investigate and arrest him. After receiving the order, Zhang instructed the police bureau chief Lin Gubiao to arrest Liu and prepare a report to hand him over to the district headquarters for legal handling.

### Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Social Club Held Joint Entertainment Gathering Yesterday

Chen Lifu Speaks on the New Life Movement's Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Shame; Pan Gongzhan and Chu Minyi Also Deliver Speeches in Succession

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Social Club, in order to promote wholesome entertainment and welcome new members, held a grand joint entertainment gathering yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The venue was decorated simply and solemnly. Central Committee member Chen Lifu also came to Shanghai from Beijing to participate in the grand ceremony and prepared valuable gifts and recreational activities. A total of over 9,000 people attended, including leaders from various sectors of the city, including military, political, business, and academic circles, such as Chu Minyi, Yu Hongjun, Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Yang Xiaotian, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Luo Qinghua, Jin Runxiang, Xie Xiaochu, and Zhou Bangjun. Details are as follows:

Gathering Situation

The presidium of the gathering included Yu Hongjun, Yang Liangtian, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Wu Kaixian, and Wang Yansong. The general secretary was Sun Mingqi, the deputies were Yuan Hongjun and Xue Jianxin, the master of ceremonies was Cao Zhigong, and the recorders were Wang Jianping and Chen Xi. The order of the meeting was: (1) Music and opening of the meeting, (2) Presidium takes their seats, (3) Attendees stand at attention, (4) Pay respects to the party and national flag and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, (5) Read Sun Yat-sen's last will and testament, (6) Chairman delivers the opening speech, (7) Mr. Chen Lifu delivers a speech, (8) Entertainment, (9) Adjournment.

Chairman's Speech

After performing the rituals, Wang Xiaolai, the chairman, delivered the opening speech, which briefly stated: "Today is the joint entertainment gathering of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Social Club. The meaning of 'entertainment' comes from the idea of being happy to do good and the gentleman's joy in virtue. Let everyone be happy together. We must study the word 'entertainment' and not just literally make merry. We must find joy in hardship. To live, one should not rely solely on entertainment, but on working hard and enduring hardship and finding joy in work. This is what makes entertainment meaningful. It should be finding joy in hardship, being happy to do good, and the gentleman's joy in virtue. Finally, because I want to ask the mayor and directors to express their views, I will not say more."

Chen's Speech

Chen Lifu then delivered a speech, saying, "I am very happy to have the opportunity to participate in the entertainment gathering of the Chamber of Commerce and the Social Club today. I am participating as a friend, and I am glad that I enjoy coming and that you all enjoy coming. It is a pleasure to be with you all at the entertainment gathering of the Chamber of Commerce and the Social Club. In the past, what I have said has mostly been too serious and unhappy. This is because I have never been good at being lively and I don't like telling jokes. Today, I will talk simply about the New Life Movement and what propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are. In the modern era, everything is three-dimensional. In the past, there were only the front and rear in war. Now, there is no front or rear because the war in the sky has broken them all up. To be a complete citizen, one must have a complete organization and actions must be very quick. For example, today, military students in Shanghai gathered and 3,000 students gathered in five minutes, which shows that the actions are very quick. Neither space nor time allows us to be slow. We must cherish our time, because without agile, simple, diligent, and frugal actions, one cannot be called a new citizen. What are propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame? Propriety is order. A large number of people must have order and be able to stand up and act together in half a minute, which is propriety. Actions that are not agile, such as turning backwards, etc., are all without order. We must jointly promote this. Everyone must have order to have propriety. Righteousness is using our strength to help others. The strong help the weak, which is a manifestation of righteousness. There is not only righteousness in spirit, but also righteousness in matter. For example, if there is a poor person who has no strength, we all go to help him. This kind of help is the material righteousness. Being able to help people and being able to use more strength to help less strength are all acts of righteousness. Integrity is not taking what one should not take. This is integrity. If a person only has a salary of 100 yuan per month and takes income beyond 100 yuan, it is harming integrity and infringing on others, which is also not integrity. Everything that one should not do in spirit and matter is called integrity. Shame is not doing things that one should not do. Knowing shame is not doing things that harm others, which is also called knowing shame. I will now give a simple explanation of the four words propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. Propriety distributes order, which is called propriety. Righteousness is already distributed and willing to sacrifice oneself for the public, which is called righteousness. Integrity is already distributed and each maintains their own boundaries, which is called integrity. Shame is already distributed and doing things in order without causing chaos, which is called shame. If everyone can achieve propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, everyone can serve others and do their duty and be good people. The spirit of an individual is already happy, which can make the spirit of the group also happy. Every person can be unselfish, which can strengthen the country and the race. Implementing this kind of motivation in an individual is called the New Life Movement. Implementing it in a group is called a new organization. Promoting it throughout the country can result in new citizens. Being happy today means that everyone can practice the New Life Movement and help others, which is the meaning of everyone being happy together. I hope that the gentlemen and ladies attending the meeting will work hard to promote it. I have always liked to say serious things and I hope that everyone will do it. I wish you all health and national rejuvenation." Pan and Chu's Speeches: Chairman Pan's speech said, "Today, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Social Club are holding an entertainment gathering at the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. It is a great honor to have Mr. Chen Lifu and Mr. Chu Minyi, members of the Central Committee, grace us with their presence. Before initiating this gathering, I was recommended to be the director of preparations. In fact, all the work was completed through the efforts of the comrades in the club. I feel ashamed to be enjoying the reputation. Now, I will briefly explain the significance of today's gathering. Some people may ask, when the country is facing such serious difficulties, why are you still holding an entertainment gathering? Regarding this, I have two points to explain. We know that happiness is enough to encourage our spirits. We must not be pessimistic and we must not frown all day long. We must always have a positive attitude and then we will feel interested in doing things. For example, today is Sunday. Holding an entertainment gathering here can relax our minds and restore the spirit we were tired of from the previous six days of work. This is one point. The second point is, why are we mobilizing so many people today and inviting thousands of people to this entertainment gathering? I will tell you that these two words 'entertainment' are not our new creation. We are imitating the methods of the ancients. If you have read ancient books, you should be able to recall a section of the dialogue between Mencius and King Xuan of Qi. At that time, King Xuan of Qi was extravagant and only knew how to enjoy himself. However, his people were mostly worried. King Xuan did not understand this principle and asked Mencius for advice. Mencius did not criticize his enjoyment, but only asked, 'Is it more enjoyable to be happy alone or to be happy with others?' In the end, Mencius contributed to King Xuan of Qi's idea, saying, 'If the king wants to rule the world, he should abandon his preconceived notions of personal enjoyment and implement 'sharing joy with the people'. Then the people will be happy.' Therefore, today we are holding this gathering based on the instructions of ancient philosophers and hope that in the future we can use the two words 'happiness' as the standard for our common life." Chu Minyi's speech said, "I made a special trip here today to participate in the joint entertainment gathering held by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Social Club. I am very happy. I just heard Mr. Chen Lifu explain the significance of the New Life Movement and national rejuvenation. We should start from today and encourage ourselves and others in this way. I think it is really not easy to find a proper and noble entertainment in Shanghai. On the contrary, all kinds of despicable and dirty places to seek pleasure are everywhere. Therefore, in this bad environment, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Social Club are holding this noble and meaningful entertainment gathering, which is really worthy of admiration. At the same time, I hope that through the promotion of this gathering, we can correct all irregular and illegal entertainment and use the life of the entertainment gathering to open up our path to unity and national salvation." Finally, Mr. Wang Yansong delivered a reply speech and the meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. After the meeting, recreational activities began. Yesterday's meeting displayed many prizes, especially the scholarships from Central Committee member Chu Minyi and Luo Qinghua, which attracted the attention of the audience. At 6:00 PM, the 2,000 yuan university scholarship from Chu Minyi was drawn by the wife of Mr. Tu Kaizheng, manager of the Jicheng Pharmacy. Luo Qinghua's 1,080 yuan scholarship was won by Wang Yueqian, from the first branch of the shipbuilding industry labor union in the Fourth District of Yangshupu. The guests were immediately informed and there was a burst of cheers.

### Bank Consortium Formed by Bank of Communications and Others for Native Cloth

Investment of One Million to Develop Native Cloth; Loans to Be Released in Three Years for Improvement of Production and Sales

The output of native cloth in Nantong and other counties in Jiangsu is quite large, but development is difficult due to economic constraints. Ge Tan, the chairman of the Nantong Native Cloth Improvement Committee and the administrative inspector of the Fourth District of Jiangsu Province, has come to Shanghai several times to discuss investment and development production methods with the banking community to seek relief. The Xin Xin News Agency reporter learned from the banking community that the Bank of Communications, Jiangsu Farmers' Bank, and other banks have accepted the request and formed a native cloth consortium, investing 1 million yuan. The loan methods have also been agreed upon and are roughly as follows: (1) Loan types are divided into production tools, production and sales, and foreign exchange mortgage, with a total amount of 1 million yuan, to be released in three years: 100,000 yuan in the first year, 270,000 yuan in the second year, and 980,000 yuan in the third year (it is expected that 350,000 will be recovered in the third year, so the total is 1 million yuan). (2) The Improvement Committee will introduce cooperatives to apply for loans from the consortium, and the Improvement Committee will bear the guarantee responsibility. (3) The Improvement Committee must establish 150 cooperatives in Nantong, Chongming, and Haizhou counties in stages within three years to provide universal guidance to improve production and sales. After the above methods are agreed upon, the procedures for signing the contract are currently underway and will be implemented soon.

Then, He Yuanming, representative of the Municipal Party Department, delivered an instruction speech, followed by speeches by guests Cao Zhigong, Mao Yun, Yu Yaoqiu, Yao Yizhang, Ge Futian, and Tao Leqin. Finally, Wang Xiaolai unveiled the curtain and Lin Kanghou raised the flag. The ceremony was very grand.

Chairman's Speech

Chairman Lin Kanghou said in his opening speech, "The national goods industry in our country has been sticking to conventions and does not know how to improve, resulting in daily decline. Since the May Fourth Movement, the Chinese people have gradually learned to improve, but the dumping of foreign goods has not stopped and people's accumulated habits are difficult to reverse, so we have not been able to achieve our expectations. Recently, Japanese smugglers have been dumping goods everywhere, not only destroying our country's tariff barriers, but also deeply affecting our country's industrial and commercial industries. Therefore, this association is holding a joint competition of national goods manufacturers to arouse public attention in order to achieve the goal of saving the country with national goods." Liu Zhongying then reported on the preparatory process, briefly.

Party Department's Instructions

He Yuanming, representative of the Municipal Party Department, said in his speech, "The promotion of national goods should pay attention to the following three points: (1) Unity. All national goods manufacturers should maintain a spirit of cooperation and unity to seek the development of the national goods industry. (2) Comparison. Manufacturers should compare their products with each other, choose the strengths of others, and make up for their own shortcomings. (3) Propaganda. Make the advantages of national goods known to the general public and make it easier to purchase them. In short, in seeking national rejuvenation and economic revival, the smooth sale of national goods has a great relationship. Your association includes the above three meanings, so it is not only thinking about the national goods industry, but also about the future of the national economy."

General Assembly Manifesto

Promoting national goods is a key plan for saving the country. This is a commonly heard slogan. Today, the poison of smuggled goods has spread throughout the country. Only by the people of the country working together with one heart and one mind and making concerted efforts to promote the national goods movement can we save the current economic crisis. At present, the people of the country are all heartbroken by the depth of the harm that smuggled goods are doing to the country, but the sources of smuggled goods are organized and have a background. Moreover, some unscrupulous merchants are blinded by profit and willing to act as accomplices. Smuggled goods often change their appearance, falsely claiming to be European and American goods or even posing as national goods, confusing the market. The people of the country do not know and are easily deceived. Therefore, even in the midst of resisting smuggled goods, smuggled goods are instead rampant. This is truly infuriating. Holding a national goods exhibition is a way to promote national goods. It gathers the products of national goods factories, displays them publicly, and allows people to visit them. This not only increases the recognition of national goods by the people of the country, but also encourages their enthusiasm for using them. Actively promoting national goods is the passive way to curb smuggled goods. The meaning is deep. However, past national goods exhibitions seem to have been too focused on the consumer side, and little attention has been paid to the manufacturers themselves. Therefore, this association has initiated the Joint Competition of National Goods Manufacturers, with the hope that national goods manufacturers can learn from each other, compare each other, study each other, and encourage each other while participating in the competition, so that the manufacture of national goods becomes more sophisticated and the strong establishment of the national goods front can protect national prosperity and prosperity. In recent years, the national goods industry in our country has made considerable progress under the three conditions of government promotion, manufacturer efforts, and national patriotic sentiment. There are facts to prove it. In the past, many items such as electric fans and light bulbs had to rely on foreign countries, but today they can all be self-sufficient. However, as the saying goes, "the road is one foot high, the demon is ten feet high." The enemy's economic aggression is becoming more and more serious. It can be seen that to complete the mission of saving the country with national goods, we still need to continue our efforts. I hope that the people of the country will rise up and make plans for this. This is the declaration.

### Sun Ke Received Reporters Yesterday and Discussed the Completion of the Pudong Water Plant, Stressing the Need to Correct Past Mistakes

Develop Qiongya by First Building Railways and Opening Seaports. Recently Suffering from a Cold, He Rested for Several Days Before Returning to Nanjing.

Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, received reporters from the Xin Sheng News Agency at his residence yesterday morning. In answering reporters' questions, Sun first discussed China's diplomatic policy, which remains consistent. His attitude towards Japan is as Foreign Minister Wang expressed in his talk with Japanese reporters: neither softening nor hardening, deeply wishing that the Japanese government and public would understand this point. In the past, the Japanese authorities often regarded China as easy to bully, believing that they could force China to submit through military force. This is a great mistake. If Japan wants to improve relations with China, it must correct its own mistakes and re-examine China. The Minseito cabinet has not been established for long, and its policy towards China is still unknown. However, Hirota Koki has been reappointed as Foreign Minister and has stated that he will maintain his so-called three principles. From this, we can infer the intentions of the Japanese side. It is said that they will adopt a so-called "gradual advancement" approach. Regarding reports of repeated attempts by bandit-puppet troops to invade Chahar and Suiyuan, Mr. Sun stated that he had not heard of them. If there are any, the Chahar and Suiyuan authorities may have reported directly to the military authorities. However, after ten years of resistance, the border defenses of Chahar and Suiyuan have become increasingly fortified and cannot be easily breached by bandit-puppet troops. Mr. Sun continued by saying that Mr. Song Ziwen's trip south this time is to deliberate on the development of Qiongya and handle financial matters in Guangdong Province. Regarding the development plan, it has been decided to start with the construction of railways and the opening of seaports, requiring a sum of tens of millions of yuan, which can be completed in two years. He had originally intended to go and inspect it himself, but it is still difficult to make the trip for the time being. Mr. Sun concluded by saying that he will go to Lushan during the Legislative Yuan's recess, but whether he will stay there or choose another place to escape the summer heat is still undecided. He has recently been suffering from a cold and is currently under medical treatment. He will return to Nanjing after resting for several days, he said.

### Pudong Water Plant Completion, Invitation to All Circles to Visit

10:00 AM on the 23rd

The Shanghai Municipal Government, recognizing that the Pudong area is vast, with numerous factories and warehouses, and a steadily growing population, while lacking water supply facilities, which affects both sanitation and fire prevention, ordered the Xingye Trust Company to actively prepare for construction. After one year and eight months of preparation and construction, at a total cost of 700,000 yuan, the Pudong Water Plant, managed by the city, has finally been completed and started supplying water on the 19th of this month. The company has specifically scheduled the 23rd to invite all circles to visit. The details are as follows:

Construction Process

In October 1934, the Xingye Trust Company, under the order of the Municipal Government, began active preparations and immediately engaged in meticulous research. It strived for perfection and economic rationality in all aspects, including water sources, construction, and water treatment equipment, to ensure fair water prices. At the same time, it investigated and determined that a daily water supply of at least 3 million gallons would be necessary to meet the demand. However, due to the massive scale of the project and the significant expense involved, it was estimated that operating revenue and expenditure would not be able to offset the cost for at least five years, let alone generate profits. Nevertheless, for the sake of public welfare, it was felt that such a challenging task could not be shirked. Experts were immediately hired to design the plant, and the latest water treatment equipment and pipes were ordered from well-known factories. Construction began in September of the 23rd year of the Republic and was completed after one year and eight months, at a total cost of over 700,000 yuan.

Equipment Glimpse

The Pudong Water Plant is located on Youlong Road (Taoyuanzhai area of Yangjing District). The plant's equipment is all of the latest design, including a Pumping Station, a settling basin, a rapid filtration basin, a clear water basin, a clear water pumping station, a high water tower, an alum dosing room, a laboratory, an office, and a materials room. All the machines in the plant are powered by electricity, which is efficient and easy to manage. Special attention is paid to water treatment and testing, and the instruments used are the most valuable and accurate. Specialized technicians have been hired to work in the plant to ensure that the water quality is absolutely clean to protect the health of the citizens.

Water Supply Area

The plant's water supply area and the water pipes for each route are laid in two phases. Therefore, the current water supply starts from the water plant and extends north to Qichangzhan and south to Tangqiao. The second phase of the plan aims to extend north to Yangjing and south to Baichijing, and will be laid in the near future. The total construction cost of the plant, including the plant base, water treatment equipment, trunk lines, and other supplementary materials and temporary supplementary projects, amounts to more than 700,000 yuan. The current maximum daily water output is 3 million gallons, which is sufficient to meet the needs of the citizens.

Invitation to Visit

Xu Xinliu, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Xingye Trust Company, Wu Yunqi, Managing Director, and Xu Fu, General Manager, announced that the plant has been completed and specifically scheduled today, the 23rd, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, to invite all circles to visit the plant on Youlong Road in Pudong. All attendees can present their invitation cards and take the city ferry from Beijing Road Wharf to Yongdong Chunjiang Wharf, or take the city ferry from Dongmen Road Wharf to Pudong Dongchang Wharf, and then take a special rickshaw arranged by the company directly to the water plant.

### Marine Engineers' Petition to Nanjing Failed Yesterday

Ministry of Communications Invited Marine Engineer Representatives for Inquiry

Marine engineers from various companies, including China Merchants, Sanbei, Hongan, and Ningxing, have repeatedly requested the China Marine Engineers' Association to ask their respective companies to improve their treatment in line with the state's emphasis on technical personnel, given the current high freight rates and increased shipping revenue, while the treatment of marine engineers remains as low as in the past. Except for the Sanbei Company, which has individually planned to increase the salaries of senior and junior engineers, the other companies have not yet provided a concrete response. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company suddenly expressed its views the day before yesterday, explaining the marine engineers' request for improved treatment. Therefore, all marine engineers from the company's ships in Shanghai gathered with more than 50 marine engineers from other companies at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss jointly petitioning the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, and other agencies in Nanjing to explain the reasons why their treatment should be improved. When the Marine Engineers' Association learned of this, it immediately tried to dissuade them and urged them to be patient. At the same time, the person in charge of the association announced that the Ministry of Communications had telegraphed, ordering the dispatch of representatives to Nanjing to negotiate the issue of improving the treatment of marine engineers. Three representatives were selected and were expected to depart that evening, hoping that all members would temporarily suspend the petition and await the results of the representatives' negotiations before making a final decision. As a result, since the association had taken the responsibility, the marine engineers did not proceed with the petition yesterday.

### Women's Groups Hosted the Press Yesterday

Reporting the Purpose of Striving to Participate in Constitutional Work and Hoping that the Press Will Assist with a Fair Stand

Twelve groups including the Shanghai Women's Movement Promotion Association, the Women's Progressive Association, and the National Young Women's Christian Association, have repeatedly united with women's circles in Shanghai to discuss and strive for the number of women's constitutional delegates in order to strive to participate in constitution-making. To clarify the situation for all circles, they specifically hosted a reception at the Pudong Fellow-Villagers Association yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, inviting representatives from various women's groups and reporters from various newspapers, totaling more than 30 people. Qian Jianqiu, Chairman, first reported, stating, "Today, the women's circles in Shanghai are hosting you all here because we feel that although our female compatriots can stand on an equal footing with men, there are still many facts that prevent us from being truly equal. In terms of the constitutional movement, women actually account for half of the national population, and the number of constitutional delegates should be equal to that of men, but the reality is not so. Therefore, our women's circles should rise up and strive to: 1. Immediately abolish the Special Organizations Law for Civic Groups, lift restrictions on the establishment of women's groups, and support the development of the women's movement; 2. Ensure that half of the 240 government-appointed delegates are women; 3. Appoint more female representatives in special elections; 4. Convene national women's leaders to jointly discuss the appointment of female representatives, and hope that the press will provide assistance with a fair stand." Jin Guangmei then reported on the progress of the situation, and the meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.

### Municipal Government 10th Anniversary Celebration Reception for the Press Tonight

Reporting the Significance of the Celebration

The Preparatory Committee for the 10th Anniversary Celebration of the Establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government announced that with the anniversary approaching, in addition to actively preparing for exhibitions on industry, hygiene, and safety, as well as a lantern parade, it has also scheduled a reception for the press at the Central Hotel on Fuzhou Road at 7:30 PM tonight to report on the significance of the 10th Anniversary Celebration of the Establishment of the Municipal Government. It is reported that Acting Mayor Yu and the heads of all departments will attend to host the reception with their staff.

### A Glimpse of the Disaster Situation in Shanxi Province

Severe Cases: 90 Percent, Less Severe Cases: 70 Percent

More than 30 counties in the southwestern corner of Shanxi Province are suffering from severe drought. Representatives Luo Zengshou and Zhu Sirong were previously elected by people from the area and went to Nanjing via Shanghai to appeal to all parties for emergency relief. Subsequently, the Relief Committee instructed the local army, Commander Pang Bingdong and Division Commander Zhu Huaibing, to conduct on-the-ground surveys and report the situation in their respective areas. The local disaster relief association also submitted a report to the army, requesting a prompt response so that the disaster victims could receive benefits and save lives as soon as possible. Commander Pang's defense area includes An'yi, Yi'shi, Xiaxian, and Jiexian counties. He has already investigated and reported the extent of the disaster. A letter from the army to the local disaster relief association states: "Regarding your letter of June 9, requesting that we send personnel to survey the disaster so that the central government can provide relief as soon as possible, we have received it. After investigating, the army stationed in this area is deeply concerned about the local disaster and the suffering of the people. Subsequently, upon receiving a telegram from Committee Member Zhu Weiziqiao on the 6th, entrusting us to investigate the disaster situation in Hedong, we immediately telegraphed our findings, which stated in brief that there has been no rain or snow in Hedong from last autumn to the beginning of this summer. Although new wheat has been harvested, Xiaxian and Jiexian counties only harvested 30 percent, while An'yi and Yi'shi counties only harvested 10 percent. The disaster has reached 70 to 90 percent. Nowadays, even small and medium-sized families have long exhausted their grain reserves, and various taxes and levies are exacerbating the people's suffering. The price of wheat has risen to over 10 yuan per 100 jin, and the poor cannot afford to buy grain, and their livelihoods are on the verge of collapse. They are leading the old and carrying the young, begging for food in the city, and even resorting to snatching food, which is often seen. Currently, with the old harvest gone and the new harvest not yet in, there is a truly a scene of starvation everywhere. This letter is to inform you. Please investigate accordingly."

### Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange Approves Capital Increase

Decision Made at Yesterday's Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting; Auction of Corporate Bonds and Foreign Securities to Open

The Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange held an extraordinary shareholders meeting at its market on Hankou Road yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. 256 shareholders, holding a total of 42,012 shares, attended. Chairman Zhang Weiru presided over the meeting, reported on the business situation, and explained the process of the proposed capital increase. The proposals were then discussed. 1. The proposal to increase the exchange's capital by 1.8 million yuan to a total of 3 million yuan was passed. 2. The proposal to amend the exchange's articles of association was decided to be submitted for amendment at the next shareholders meeting. The original text of the capital increase proposal is as follows:

"The scope of securities is very broad. In recent years, due to the backwardness of production and the sluggishness of industry and commerce in our country, the circulation of stocks has been difficult, and corporate bonds have been unable to be issued. As a result, the exchange's market operations have been limited to domestic public bonds. Although it is said to be developed, it is inevitably biased. Recently, the political situation has become more consolidated, and industry and commerce have gradually recovered. Taking Shanghai as an example, more and more major companies are increasing their capital and issuing huge amounts of corporate bonds, and prices are very firm. This shows that the social and economic situation is gradually improving, and the people's interest in investment is gradually increasing. In order to cope with the modern environment, the exchange has long planned to expand and open the auction of company stocks, bonds, and gold coin public bonds issued abroad to increase business. However, due to the importance of this matter, it is difficult to promote and benefit from it without huge capital and the cooperation of the financial community. There was once a proposal for a second market dedicated to auctioning company stocks and bonds, but the board of directors believed that having two organizations in one company would not only make it difficult to coordinate operations, but also might cause misunderstandings from the outside world. After a long period of consideration by the board of directors and multiple meetings, it was deemed necessary to increase capital to welcome investment from the financial community to facilitate mutual cooperation and promote the exchange's business. It is proposed to increase the exchange's capital by 1.8 million yuan to a total of 3 million yuan. Among the new capital of 1.8 million yuan, it is proposed to welcome investment from the financial community with 1.1 million yuan. However, this method does not comply with the provisions of Article 190 of the Company Law. How should we decide? In addition, how should the remaining new capital of 600,000 yuan be allocated among the old shareholders of the exchange? We also ask for a discussion."

### All Circles Schedule Oath Ceremony to Not Buy or Sell Smuggled Goods

Propaganda Meeting Scheduled for the 27th; Various Charts and Slogans to be Drawn, Posted, and Viewed

The Shanghai All Circles Anti-Smuggling Movement Committee has scheduled for the 26th of this month to convene representatives from all sectors to take an oath to not buy or sell smuggled goods. A propaganda and membership meeting will be held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM on the 27th. The details are as follows:

Oath to Not Buy or Sell Smuggled Goods

The committee, recognizing that smuggling is rampant and is gradually penetrating from North China to Central China, South China, and the Yangtze River coast, causing more harm than floods and fierce beasts, not only reducing national tax revenue but also destroying the vitality of national industries, has specifically scheduled a meeting at the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM on the 26th of this month to convene representatives from the artificial silk industry, the hardware industry, and more than 20 related trade associations directly affected by smuggled goods to take an oath to not buy or sell smuggled goods in order to arouse the patriotic enthusiasm of the people. For the sake of prudence, the committee has specifically invited Shi Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Du Yuesheng, President of the Local Association, to attend the meeting as witnesses to show solemnity.

Holding Expanded Propaganda Meeting

The Anti-Smuggling Movement Committee, in order to arouse public attention to the harm of smuggling, which has a profound and significant impact on the country and the nation, has prepared to hold an expanded propaganda meeting, which has been decided to be held at the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM on the 27th of this month. Preparations have already begun. In addition to the propaganda meeting on that day, leaders from all sectors will be invited to broadcast speeches, perform entertainment, and give costume speeches. The committee has also requested various daily newspapers to publish special issues.

Publishing Smuggled Goods Import Figures

In order to enable all sectors to understand the value of smuggled goods, the committee has specifically written to the customs authorities to compile and publish the statistics for public viewing by the public so that they are alerted. At that time, various charts will be hung around the meeting place. In addition, various illustrations and slogans depicting ruffians smuggling with the protection of certain parties and assaulting and insulting customs officers will be drawn and posted on various thoroughfares for public viewing.

### New Japanese Marines Arrive in Shanghai Again

The Japanese Naval Landing Forces stationed in Shanghai have suddenly increased since the 1st of this month. In addition to the more than 200 soldiers led by Ito Tsutomu, who arrived successively from Sasebo and other places on the Nagasaki Maru and Shanghai Maru some time ago, it is now learned that another batch of approximately 50 soldiers has been transferred from the Kirishima Naval Base and is expected to arrive here on the 15th of this month. It is also learned that after this batch of Japanese troops arrives in Shanghai, they will be assigned to the Marine Corps. The total number of Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai, including the previous arrivals, will be more than 2,500.

### Takagi Rokuro Goes to Nanjing to Visit Wu Dingchang

Takagi Rokuro, Director of the Tokyo China-Japan Industrial Company, arrived in Shanghai at the beginning of this month to investigate the local industrial, commercial, banking, and financial conditions, and visited Zhou Zuomin, Chairman of the China-Japan Trade Association, and others to discuss issues such as China-Japan economic cooperation. Therefore, he has not gone elsewhere. It is now learned that Takagi must visit Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang and the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, so he is specifically scheduled to go to Nanjing next Tuesday (the 22nd) to pay respects to various parties before traveling to the Yangtze River basin and various parts of South China and North China to inspect and visit local industrial and commercial leaders to exchange views on developing China-Japan trade in order to achieve the so-called goal of China-Japan economic cooperation as soon as possible.

### Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Petitions for Abolition of Cattle and Sheep Transit Tax in the French Concession

The Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council has newly established a cattle and sheep transit tax, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly petitioned the Municipal Government to negotiate without success. The Shanghai Cattle and Sheep Trade Association has proposed to the 8th Members' Representative Assembly of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce that the Assembly petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the French Ambassador, ordering him to abolish the tax and abolish the compulsory pre-purchase of inspection tickets to maintain national sovereignty and relieve the merchants' difficulties. The Assembly has approved the proposal yesterday. The reasons for the proposal are recorded below:

"(Reasons) After investigating, the name of this transit tax is extremely unfair in light of the facts. The cattle and sheep passing through the French Concession from outside the Concession are, in terms of geographical location, within the Shanghai area and are not being transported from Country A to Country C, which would require passing through Country B. How can a commodity tax be forcibly collected? Although the French Concession is a leased territory, it is still Chinese land in reality. There is no such thing as 'transit,' let alone a 'transit tax.' Therefore, the French Concession Municipal Council's action is tantamount to implicitly regarding the French Concession as French territory, which greatly harms our national rights. Furthermore, in the pre-abolition era of lijin, merchants, both Chinese and foreign, felt inconvenienced by the transit tax levied on goods transported from one place to another. How can the French Concession create a cattle and sheep transit tax similar to lijin to hinder the passage of goods after China has already abolished lijin? By analogy, if French merchants' goods pass through the Chinese area to reach the French Concession, can they not also be charged a transit tax? Is there such a reason in the world? Moreover, this transit tax is currently limited to the collection of cattle and sheep. However, once a bad precedent is set, not only will the cattle and sheep industry, which mostly consists of small businesses, suffer from the difficulty of business during this period of economic depression, but other goods transported through the French Concession may also be subject to various transit taxes imposed by the French Concession Municipal Council. Even in the future, there may be a transit tax levied on pedestrians passing through the border. Can the future be imagined?

### Huadong Artificial Silk Factory Begins to Raise Capital

The Huadong Artificial Silk Company, initiated by financial figures such as Song Ziwen, Kong Xiangxi, Zhang Jingjiang, Song Hanzhang, Song Zian, and Hu Bijang, as well as industrial figures such as Luo Qinghua, Cai Shengbai, and Wu Yunchu, has been in preparation for a long time. It has now been approved by the Ministry of Industry and is registered with the competent authorities responsible for special manufacturing incentives. A preparatory office has been temporarily set up at the Jianshe Bank Company, and a correspondence office has been set up on the second floor of the Silk Industry Bank Building on Sanma Road. Active preparations are currently underway, and the subscription of shares has begun, with the China, Jiaotong, Silk Industry, and Jiangsu banks acting as agents for collecting share payments in various locations.

### The Yuan and Ministry Thoroughly Investigate the Names of Those Manipulating the Yarn Trading Market

A Decision to Severely Punish Them to Stabilize the Market

After the Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange's market dispute was calmed down by Du Yuesheng's mediation, powerful major players continued to purchase yarn, leading to a continued rise in yarn prices. Representatives of the shorts, such as Zhu Wenqi, visited Mr. Du the day before yesterday to ask for instructions. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the market yesterday that the Ministry of Industry has completed its investigation of the manipulation of the market, and Councilor Chen Yu returned to Nanjing the night before last to report the situation. The Control Yuan's thorough investigation is also nearing completion. A councilor from the Executive Yuan has arrived in Shanghai to conduct a secret investigation. After the names of the manipulators are investigated, a decision will be made to severely punish them to stabilize the market.

### Municipal Public Works Bureau to Conduct Ferry Registration

Starting on the 21st of this Month

A notice from the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau states: "In order to conduct the registration of commercially operated ferries on a regular basis, it has been approved by the Municipal Government to conduct the registration of commercially operated ferries as organized by the Bureau. It is now decided to start registration on June 21, with a stipulated period of one month, ending on July 21. In addition to reporting and distributing the notice, all persons operating ferries are hereby notified to be aware of this and to bring four 2.5-inch half-length photos, along with all partners of the respective ferry crossings, to the Bureau for registration, which concerns legal interests. Please do not delay or neglect this matter."

### Few Workers Resumed Work at the Mei Ya and Jing Wei Factories Yesterday Morning

Factories Report Situation to Party and Government

The Mei Ya and Jing Wei Factories and the General Factory on Ri Hui Road, Shanghai South, resumed work after receiving a joint announcement from the party and government agencies, ordering them to resume work as usual on the morning of the 15th of this month. One-third of the workers at the two factories have resumed work. Because few workers entered the factory at night, work was not started. At 6:00 AM yesterday, the two factories still started school as usual. Unexpectedly, some unscrupulous workers went to the workers' residences to prevent them from going to work and threatened and prevented workers from entering the factory along the way at Dapu Bridge and other places on the border between the Chinese and French concessions. Therefore, only more than 50 people from the Mei Ya General Factory and only more than 70 people from the Jing Wei Factory entered the factory to work by noon, which was even less than the day before. The factory has now reported the situation to the party and government agencies, who will send personnel to thoroughly investigate and strictly arrest and prosecute those involved. Workers who have not entered the factory will also be dealt with according to the joint announcement.

### Fujian Plague Prevention and Relief Association Held Tea Party Yesterday

The Fujian Plague Prevention and Relief Association held a tea party at the 9th floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA yesterday, inviting representatives from various Fujian groups in Shanghai and fellow villagers. Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Central Health Administration, attended. More than 50 people including Lin Wenqing, Li Denghui, Song Yuanyuan, Xu Shaojian, Wang Dazhen, and Hu Guigeng attended, as well as all the staff of the association. The meeting began at 2:00 PM. Li Denghui and Song Yuanyuan were elected as temporary chairmen. Song Yuanyuan stood up to give a speech, followed by Liu Ruiheng, who reported on his inspection of the plague situation in Fujian. Xiao Bichuan, Chairman of the association, explained the compilation of a concrete plan for plague prevention and relief. Wang Pingnan and Li Shian spoke successively, elaborating in great detail on the prevention and relief of the plague in Fujian. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.

### Han Weixi Visits Yang

Reporting on the Situation in Shaanxi Province and the Recent Situation of His Troops

Han Weixi, Chief of Staff of the 53rd Army, arrived in Shanghai by train from Xi'an yesterday morning at 7:40 AM. After resting at his residence, he went to Qi Qi Road at around 10:00 AM to visit Yang Hucheng, the former Pacification Commissioner of Xi'an, to report on the situation in Shaanxi Province and the recent situation of his troops. He will stay to bid farewell to Mr. Yang before he goes abroad, it was said.

### Impressions of the Industrial and Commercial Inspection Group's Trip to Japan

Developed Light and Heavy Industries; Advanced Factory Management

Li Zhenfu, a textile machinery merchant, Lin Mingsheng, a building materials merchant, Chen Shunan, a woolen fabric merchant, and Feng Yingji, a dyeing machinery merchant, were among the 13 members of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Inspection Group who traveled to Japan under the leadership of Shen Yushan, the head of the group, on the 13th of last month to inspect the industrial situation in Japan. They have completed their mission and returned to China in Shanghai a few days ago. A reporter from Shenzhou News Agency specifically visited Shen Yushan, the head of the group, yesterday to inquire about the inspection process, impressions, and feelings. According to his account, the group visited Nagasaki, Kobe, Nagoya, Nara, and other places on this trip to Japan to inspect the industrial situation. After the inspection, they went to Osaka for disbandment and free activities. He then went to Tokyo, Nikko, Hakone, and other places to visit, focusing entirely on industry and commerce. All those who were visited were the larger Japanese woolen, machinery, textile, and other types of factories. He deeply felt that Japan's light and heavy industries are equally developed, and the heavy industries are mostly managed by the state. From an objective point of view, Japan's strength since the Meiji Restoration is not accidental. It has many characteristics: 1. The quality of Japanese factory management is even better than that of European and American factories, and the factory order is extremely good. 2. Due to the prevalence of education, most of the workers are knowledgeable, and the work efficiency is faster. 3. The factories are all large-scale organizations, and there is close contact between government and business. 4. Each factory has a specialized research, improvement, and design department. 5. Labor and management can understand each other, and there are very few labor disputes. The above points have already benefited industrial development a lot. What is most worthy of our attention is that many of Japan's cloths are ordered by foreign countries and resold to other countries. At the same time, the Japanese industrial and commercial circles unanimously hold the goal of developing outward. Every time they chat, they must talk about how to sell to Europe, America, and Southeast Asia. In addition, although Japanese women's rights are low, the degree of women's employment is high. Women's employment in stores can be said to have become widespread throughout the country. The Japanese people are especially proud to use domestic products. All of these are sufficient for our attention. Looking back at our country's industry, although it has gradually shown progress in recent years, there are still many things that need to be improved. On the one hand, although we advocate worker education and labor-management cooperation, we must also pay attention to reducing costs. Only in this way can we compete with foreign goods, and there is hope for the future, he said.

### Lake Society Members' General Meeting

Chen Lifu Speaks on National Salvation Through Rural Development; Chu Minyi Reports on His Tour of Beijing and Yunnan; Proposal to Rename Beijing Road as Chen Yingshi Road

The Lake Society of this city held its 13th members' meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at its office on Guizhou Road. Representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters, including Shou Yun, and the Social Affairs Bureau, including Zhang Binghui, as well as over 500 members from this city and other places, including Qian Xinzhi, Wang Yiting, and Shen Zhongyi, attended. The presidium consisted of Chen Aishi, Shen Tianxin, Chen Baohua, Pan Gongzhan, and Yan Junxuan.

Proceedings of the Meeting

Following the customary rituals, Chairman Ai Shi first reported on the society's affairs, and Shen Tianxin reported on finances. Subsequently, representatives from the Party and government delivered speeches, and Central Committee member Chu Minyi reported on the southwest provinces tour of the Beijing-Yunnan Highway tour group.

Two foreigners are arrested after being caught red-handed stealing while shopping

In the morning of the day before yesterday, at about 1 a.m., two foreigners came to Xieshun Rice Shop located north of Xianghuaqiao Bridge, Nanxiang Town, southwest of Shanghai. They purchased a yuan worth of rice and presented a ten-yuan Central Bank note and asked for the change. Shop assistant Guo Xiaosan took out French currency from the counter drawer. The two foreigners then took advantage of the opportunity to step beside the counter and deliberately claimed the note was bad or damaged. In the end, Mr. Bao pocketed nine yuan in French currency along with one yuan, completed the transaction, and left with the rice. It was only when Guo Xiaosan counted Mr. Bao's notes that he suddenly discovered that he was forty yuan short. He became highly suspicious and reported the matter to the beat policeman. The police chased and apprehended the two foreigners and found the stolen goods on them. During interrogation, one confessed he was a 42-year-old Romanian named Molai, residing on Jing'an Temple Road, Shanghai.

### Disaster Relief Association Schedules Fundraising by Boy Scouts

The original letter reads: This year's drought in Sichuan, Guizhou, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Shanxi provinces is extremely severe, with tens of millions of disaster victims and thousands of miles of barren land. The tragic situation has been repeatedly reported in newspapers, which you must have been aware of. The Association is coordinating relief efforts and making every effort to appeal for donations. We are grateful that the Central Government has issued disaster relief funds and that people from all walks of life have enthusiastically donated. The funds have been remitted to the disaster-stricken provinces to implement relief. However, the disaster area is too vast, and the relief is limited. According to letters and telegrams from various provinces, hundreds of millions of refugees are on the verge of death. Unless continued relief is provided, they will still fill the ravines. Your organization has always been enthusiastic about disaster relief efforts and has distributed fundraising efforts with great success. We hope that you will continue to show compassion and support this effort. We plan to mobilize your entire staff on the 25th and 26th of this month (i.e., Friday and Saturday) from 8:00 AM to 5:30 PM to distribute fundraising in the Public Concession to raise funds for relief. In addition to sending letters to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Concession Bureau of Works, ordering them to assist, we are writing this letter to inform you and ask for your assistance.

### Bureau of Public Works Orders Demolition of Shantytowns in the Shanghai West Area; Robbery of Sauce Shops by Bandits

Shantytown Residents Panic and Appeal to All Parties; Compiling Household Registrations and Planning to Build Low-Cost Housing

The shantytown residents in the Shanghai West Area received a notice from the Bureau of Public Works, ordering them to demolish their homes before June 30th, causing widespread panic. Yesterday, they submitted petitions to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Citizens' Association, the Taxpayers' Association, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Municipal Shantytown Joint Association, requesting assistance. The details are as follows:

The Notice from the Bureau of Public Works

Notice: This is to notify Mr./Ms. XXX, a resident of the shack located at Shack No. X, Deed No. XXX on XX Road, that the Bureau orders the said resident to move out before June 30, 1937, or the shack will be demolished. This notice is hereby given.

The Appeal from the Shantytown Representatives

A humble request to express our grievances and request an extension of the demolition period to secure our lives. We have lived in Shanghai for many years, renting land from Chinese people to build shacks to avoid wind and rain and have a place to live. We have been repeatedly displaced. Our shacks are located in remote areas and have long been measured, mapped, and assigned doorplates by the Bureau of Public Works. Now, when the market is sluggish and all industries are depressed, we are lacking livelihoods and sanitation. At this critical moment, the Bureau, citing the superficial reasons of municipal appearance, is abandoning thousands of shantytowns and tens of thousands of people. On the 15th of this month, the Bureau sent people to remove our doorplates and then distributed notices, falsely claiming to order us to demolish and move out before June 30th, without designating a relocation site. We have investigated the location of our shacks, and the area is small and in a remote location. No matter what kind of construction, it is not applicable. If it is to open up XX Road, the surrounding area is full of buildings, which were built not long ago and have not expired. This point is even more out of the question. No matter what kind of clever words, what kind of actions, what kind of attention, what kind of promises, what kind of prestige, we are requesting various organizations to assist in the construction of low-cost housing while we are trying to manage by living in shacks. The demolition should not occur before the low-cost housing is built. We implore your Association to uphold justice, protect the property rights of shantytown residents, and negotiate with the Bureau of Public Works to extend the demolition period and return our doorplates to calm the panic. Once the low-cost housing is completed, the shacks can be demolished gradually to avoid the disaster of displacement. We are grateful to present this to the Shanghai West Shantytown Representatives Hu Yumen and others.

Compiling the Shantytown Census

The Shantytown Joint Association, after receiving the news of the demolition of shacks in the Shanghai West Area, decided that the method of shantytown residents automatically raising funds to build low-cost housing requires urgent organization. The household survey form has now been printed, and personnel will be dispatched tomorrow to start the survey in order to understand the exact number of shantytowns within the area and to prepare for the construction of low-cost housing in batches. The regulations for the survey form are as follows: Shanghai Special Zone Shantytown Joint Association Household Survey Form: ㊀ Address, ㊁ Road name and house number, ㊂ Number of rooms, ㊃ Names, ages, birthplaces, education levels, current occupations, and past occupations of family members and attached households, Name of the group leader. Once the survey is completed, we plan to build low-cost housing and provide low-cost education.

Planning to Build Low-Cost Housing

The Low-Cost Housing Construction Committee of the Shantytown Joint Association will be established soon. The organizational structure and plan are as follows: ㊀ Organization: Ten shantytown households form a group, and each group has one representative. The organization holds a representatives' meeting, which elects a number of executive committee members and hires a number of custodian committee members to form a Low-Cost Housing Construction Committee. ㊁ Plan: The principle is to raise funds to reach low-cost housing. Conduct a household survey of shantytowns and compile improvements and design plans for shantytown residents. Build low-cost housing to gradually reduce shantytowns. Economic planning and management for the construction of low-cost housing. The provision of low-cost welfare services and the establishment of a low-cost housing savings fund, with each household contributing five cents per day, which is kept by the custodian committee members and stored in a reliable bank. Once a sufficient amount has been saved to build a batch of houses, bids will be invited to construct and arrange for shantytown residents to be settled in batches to avoid displacement of shantytown residents and achieve the purpose of eliminating shantytowns.

Laidi wanted to settle the expenses for lodging and food with Lu Changming, but Lu could not afford it. He once took her to the inn, where she slept with someone for money to cover the expenses temporarily. Lu also had relations with her once. Three days later, he sent Xu back to Zhu Youcai's house. On the 15th of this month, Lu went to Zhu's house and, finding her absent, questioned Zhu's wife, Wang, who revealed that Xu had been sold to Zhang Wu, a Cantonese woman who ran a brothel at No. 18 Haining Road, by Gu Xiuqing and Yuan Laoliu as intermediaries, with Song Weixiang from Chongming falsely claiming to be Xu's father (named Xu Jianglang) for a price of 145 yuan, and entered the life of a prostitute. The next day, Gu Xiuqing distributed 57 yuan to Lu Changming. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Detectives Zhang Faxiang and Zhang Desheng and Officer Zhang Yaoji from the Hongkou Police Station learned of the matter and arrested five men and women, including Lu Changming, Zhu Youcai, Song Weixiang, Zhu's wife Wang, and Cantonese woman Zhang Cheng. Xu was also taken to the police station and sent to the Jiliang Shelter for care. Lu Changming and the others were sent to the First Special District Court Criminal Division One yesterday. The police lawyer, Qian Xun'er, explained the case and requested a postponement. Subsequently, Xu Laidi testified that she had not received any guests in Zhang Wu's brothel, but at Zhu Youcai's house and a certain inn, Zhu Wang and Lu Changming had introduced her to four or five men for sexual intercourse. When she was sold to Zhang Wu's brothel, the defendant Song Weixiang falsely claimed to be her father, which was a fact. The defendant Zhang Wu confessed that Xu was brought by Gu Xiuqing, who was on the run. Song Weixiang claimed to be her father, paid 145 yuan, and a contract was drawn up. The judge ordered all defendants to be remanded in custody for further investigation at a later date.

### Three More Robbers Involved in the Puxi Murder Case Apprehended

After investigation by Detectives Wang Jiaju and others from the Old Gate Police Station, two suspects, Zhang Pingjiang from Shanghai and Zhao Juju from Suzhou, were apprehended and remanded in custody by the First Special District Court. Now, after investigation by Detective Zhu Shangwu and others, it was discovered that accomplices in the case were hiding in Room 2 of the Zhonghe Inn on Fujian Road. They rushed to arrest them and apprehended Chen Zhenghe (also known as Xiao Mao) from Pudong, Chi Fufu (i.e., Chi Tiemin), and Xie Jindi from Qingdong. They were taken back to the police station together. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Special District Court Criminal Division One. The police lawyer, Ru Bao'yi, stated that the three criminals were involved in the robbery and murder case with Zhang Pingjiang and others, and requested permission to detain them for joint trial with Zhang Pingjiang. He also stated that Chen and Chi had both been sentenced to twenty years in prison by the court in 1928 for theft. They were later taken away by the Municipal Police Bureau, and it is unknown why they were released. Now, they have committed robbery and murder again. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, the judge ordered Chen and the other three criminals to be detained for joint trial with Zhang Pingjiang and the others.

### Shanghai Municipal Government's Measures to Attract Foreign Tourists

Passport Fee Reduced to Three Yuan; Length of Stay Set at Twenty Days

The Foreign News Agency in Shanghai reports that the Shanghai Municipal Government, in order to attract foreign tourists passing through to stay in China for a short period, has reduced the cost of transit passports from ten yuan to three yuan. This is limited to citizens of countries that have treaty relations with China. The duration of the stay is set at twenty days. Those who need to obtain this transit passport must present a written certification from the Chinese consulate abroad. After arriving in port, they must also present their train ticket or steamship ticket to the authorities for verification before the passport is issued. For citizens of countries that do not have treaty relations with China, the passport fee remains at ten yuan and will not be reduced. This newly revised measure has no impact on American tourists, as there is a reciprocal treaty between the two countries, and all transit passports are free of charge. After the municipal government proposed this revision to the fee schedule, it was submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review. The municipal government has now received a report that the proposal has been approved by the Ministry. The above-mentioned revision does not affect the original national passport fee, i.e., except for the eight yuan charged to Americans, citizens of all other countries will continue to be charged ten yuan. After the implementation of this fee reduction, it should attract a large number of foreign tourists passing through to Shanghai and the surrounding areas, allowing them to visit important cities and scenic spots in the vicinity within twenty days. Since the opening of various air routes, this twenty-day stay can be considered sufficient time for tourists to travel and visit.
