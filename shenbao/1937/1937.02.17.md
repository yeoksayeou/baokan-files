### Ambassador Cheng Discusses Sino-German Relations

Increased Trade, Enhanced Cultural Cooperation

[Berlin] Chinese Ambassador to Germany Cheng Tianfang recently received a reporter from the "Angriff" newspaper and immediately issued a statement discussing the commercial relationship between China and Germany. It is reported that Germany's exports to China mainly consist of dyes, machinery, building materials, scientific instruments, photographic supplies, and pharmaceuticals. China sells certain agricultural and mineral products to Germany, such as lead, antimony, tin, and tungsten. In terms of quantity, Germany currently ranks second in China's import trade. In 1936, German goods exported to China were worth 136,000,000 yuan, an increase of 42,000,000 yuan compared to 1935. Chinese goods exported to Germany in 1935 were worth only 16,000,000 yuan, but last year they also increased by 20,000,000 yuan to 36,000,000 yuan. Ambassador Cheng then mentioned the cultural relationship between China and Germany, stating that Tongji University in Shanghai currently has 20 German professors, Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou has nine, and public and private universities in Beiping have a total of 40 German professors. There are over 500 Chinese students in Germany. All of this is sufficient to prove the close cultural relationship between China and Germany. (Fifteenth Havas Dispatch)

After performing the ceremony as usual, he gave an earnest speech, stating briefly: "Since taking office after the telegram, I have been unable to come to the provincial government often due to the ongoing peace process, which I deeply regret. I lack political experience and was appointed to govern Shaanxi at a difficult time, knowing that my talents are insufficient for the task. However, it is the duty of a soldier to obey orders. The central government has considered the Northwest and believes that, given my connections to the region, I am suitable to oversee and preside over the administration of Shaanxi. The elders of my hometown have also urged me to take on this responsibility, and I could not refuse. Therefore, I have reluctantly accepted this task. From now on, I will uphold the central government's policy of peace, resisting aggression, and saving the nation, led by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and work hard to carry it out. In the administrative system, I will strive for consistency in order to promote governance. I hope that talented and knowledgeable individuals in Shaanxi will offer me guidance, and I will sincerely listen to their advice. I hope that my colleagues in the government will serve with peace of mind, be mindful of the difficult times, and work diligently to correct my shortcomings."

Current Affairs Commentary

### The "Clear Diplomacy" of the Hayashi Cabinet Towards China

— Fu

When the Hayashi Cabinet of Japan was established on the first of this month, it originally appointed Ambassador to the United States Saito Hiroshi as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Before Saito could return to Japan to take office, Prime Minister Hayashi temporarily acted as his proxy. Now, Saito has indicated that he will not take the position, and the new cabinet has not considered new candidates for Minister of Foreign Affairs. Since the organization of cabinets in Japan, the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs has almost always been held by professional diplomats. There have only been a few instances where non-professional diplomats have held the position, and they were mostly prime ministers concurrently serving as foreign ministers. According to research by Professor Cooley Grove of the United States, cabinets where the foreign minister is not a professional diplomat generally do not last long. (See the American Journal of International Law Quarterly, published in January of this year.) Whether the Hayashi Cabinet, with the Prime Minister concurrently serving as Foreign Minister, can escape Professor Cooley Grove's prediction remains to be seen. Let us not discuss these larger and more distant matters, but instead analyze the diplomatic policy towards China announced by Hayashi, who also serves as Foreign Minister.

In the diplomatic speech delivered by Hayashi, who also serves as Foreign Minister, in the Diet on the 15th, although it touched on various aspects, the most important part was naturally the policy towards China. The diplomacy of Hayashi, who also serves as Foreign Minister, towards China is the so-called "clear diplomacy." The meaning of "clear diplomacy," in the words of Hayashi, who also serves as Foreign Minister, is: "The people of the two countries should cultivate harmonious feelings and strive for the clarity of national relations, joining hands to achieve stability in East Asia. ... Both sides should strive to understand the other's position, not only the governments but especially to stimulate contact between the people, in order to promote the practical achievements of Japanese-Chinese cooperation and assistance. At the same time, if there are obstacles, they should be removed." This "clear diplomacy" sounds much more pleasant than Hirota's Three Principles on the surface. In particular, Prime Minister Hayashi's responses to questions from Diet members are most likely to arouse the illusions of general "enlightened people." For example, when Prime Minister Hayashi responded to Sakatani Yoshio's question in the House of Peers, he said, "Japan does not want to invade North China, and when such an opportunity arises, it will do its best to dispel misunderstandings." Also, in the House of Representatives, when responding to Uehara's question, he said, "Japan has not only repeatedly expressed its non-aggression towards China, but will reiterate this when the opportunity arises. I fully sympathize with you in thinking it is necessary to recognize the new situation in China." These words are all sweet honey on the surface, but their core is full of venomous meaning. We do not need to cite many reasons to explain this. Just looking at the confession of the Domei News Agency is enough. The Tokyo dispatch of the Domei News Agency on the 16th, after quoting Hayashi's, who also serves as Foreign Minister, speech, "... at the same time, if there are obstacles to Sino-Japanese cooperation, they should be removed," went on to explain, "These words indicate that the Hayashi Cabinet's policy towards China is based on goodwill efforts, but in order to achieve this goal, it is determined to implement forceful measures." This means that the first step in Japan's policy towards China is to demand that the Chinese government and public sweep away the anti-Japanese sentiment. Then, it will proceed to demand the resolution of various outstanding cases. If there is a force in our country that hinders this resolution, Japan will not hesitate to take forceful measures to eliminate it. From the confession of the Japanese news agency, we can clearly understand the aggressive meaning contained in the "clear diplomacy" of the Hayashi Cabinet towards China and should not entertain any illusions.

The aggressive policy of the Hayashi Cabinet towards China can certainly be inferred from the diplomatic speech of the Foreign Minister. It can be even more clearly understood from observing the nature of the Hayashi Cabinet. This has already been explained in this newspaper's current affairs commentary on the 3rd. Recently, the Minister of Finance withdrew the budget compiled by Baba, recompiled it, and saved more than 260 million yuan in expenditures, but did not reduce military spending at all. The fourth point of the political program announced by the Hayashi Cabinet on the 8th also strongly emphasizes the importance of strengthening national defense. From these various measures, it can be seen that the new cabinet obeys the orders of the military without exception. Therefore, the diplomacy of Hayashi, who also serves as Foreign Minister, towards China is naturally dominated by the power of the military.

How should we deal with this so-called "clear diplomacy" towards China? It is very clear that the experience of the past year has already told us that only by adopting a firm policy of not ceding territory or humiliating the nation can we defeat the conspiracies and ambitions of the aggressors. Now, as the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, which is discussing major national policies, is being held, we especially hope that the attendees will be able to immediately discuss and decide on practical methods for "how to recover the territory and sovereignty that has been invaded" and "how to defend the territory and sovereignty that will be invaded."

### British House of Commons Discusses Negotiations with Germany

Only Exchanging Views on Various Issues; Britain Has No Intention of Considering Returning Colonies

[London] The issue of Germany's demand to restore its pre-war colonies was the most important point discussed in the House of Commons last night. The government was subjected to continuous questioning from members of parliament. First, Conservative MP Lochland Purson inquired about the results of the conversation between German Ambassador Ribbentrop and Acting Foreign Secretary Halifax last week, and whether Foreign Secretary Eden could announce them. He also requested that the government promise not to return colonies to Germany or give it overseas trade opportunities before Parliament had discussed the matter. Since Foreign Secretary Eden is still on vacation, Lochland Purson's question was answered by Under-Secretary of State Cranborne, who said that the recent conversation between Acting Foreign Secretary Halifax and German Ambassador Ribbentrop could not be considered the beginning of negotiations. It was only an exchange of views on various issues in which both countries had an interest. He also mentioned Prime Minister Baldwin's declaration on April 27 of last year, stating that the British government had not discussed the issue. Conservative MP Adams then asked the Foreign Secretary whether, in order to dispel Germany's unrealistic thoughts, the Foreign Secretary could state in clear and unambiguous terms that the British government would not consider returning any territory under British political jurisdiction to National Socialist Germany. Cranborne replied that, as he had already stated, the British government had not previously considered this issue and was not considering it now. Adams said, "Is discussion not currently underway?" Cranborne replied, "I have said repeatedly that it has not been discussed before and is not being discussed now." Later, Liberal MP Harris asked whether the news published in foreign newspapers was completely unfounded. Cranborne said, "Indeed." Conservative MP Sandys then put forward a resolution stating, "Although Germany has made demands regarding colonies, the House of Commons expresses its satisfaction with the government's refusal to consider any return of territory." (Sixteenth Central News Agency Reuter's Dispatch)

[London] Sir Cranborne, representing the Foreign Secretary, replied to inquiries in the House of Commons, stating that diplomatic negotiations to gather five powers to conclude a West European pact were underway. A Labour MP wanted to know whether, after the signing of the Franco-Russian pact, there was any basis to rumors that the German government would retract its March 1936 proposal for a West European pact. Sir Cranborne replied that the German government had not submitted this note to the British government and that the rumors had no factual basis. The MP then asked why the German government had not answered the list of questions submitted by the British government in May of last year. Sir Cranborne replied that the German government had cited the reason that Britain had not yet expressed its views on the future of the League of Nations. Cranborne replied to questions regarding the participation of Italian warships in the Battle of Málaga, stating that the British government had not received any news of this, and that there were Soviet troops stationed in Barcelona and Madrid.

### Göring, German Minister of Aviation, Engages in Activities in Poland Again

To Hunt with the Polish President, Departing with a Declaration of Germany's Plea for Peace

Warsaw – German Minister of Aviation Göring arrived here at 9:30 this morning, and was met by the Deputy Foreign Minister, who hosted a luncheon to welcome him. In the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by the German Ambassador to Poland. Tomorrow morning, he will go to Białowieża to hunt with President Mościcki. Accompanying Göring were two secretaries and two adjutants, as well as ten plainclothes police officers. As the newspapers had not announced Göring's arrival time in Warsaw in advance, there were very few people at the station to welcome him. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

Warsaw – Foreign reports suggest that when German Aviation Minister General Göring comes here to hunt, he often takes the opportunity to negotiate with Polish authorities and Gdańsk Free City Senate President Greiser, with the aim of Germany and Poland signing an agreement to return the Free City of Gdańsk to Germany. In return, Germany would provide two assurances: first, it would respect the current state of Poland's corridor; and second, Poland would still be able to freely use the Port of Gdańsk. Responsible parties here have formally denied the above news, saying that Greiser will not come here to hunt until the 26th of this month, and will not meet with General Göring. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

Danzig – Danzig Senate President Greiser, in response to various rumors in the French newspapers, issued a statement saying that he was invited by the Polish President to participate in a hunt, which is his fourth time.

### Unified Command of Government Forces in Madrid

More Than a Thousand Rebels Killed

[Madrid] General Miaja, Chairman of the National Defense Council, has been appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Madrid front, and all government forces in the surrounding areas are under his command. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

Madrid – The government today appointed General Miaja as commander-in-chief of the front, as a result of three representatives of the National Defense Council going to Valencia to request it. With the command of the front unified, Prime Minister Caballero also gave a speech to 100,000 people, urging the conflicting factions within the People's Front to unite. The rebels today still tried to cut off the highway to Valencia, but after the government forces counterattacked with artillery and tanks, the highway remained open. (National Telegram, 15th)

Madrid – As a result of the fierce fighting in the area of the Jarama River southeast of the capital in recent days, the Nationalist forces suffered a total of over a thousand casualties, and the government forces' positions have been improved. To the northeast of the capital, within the province of Guadalajara, the Nationalist forces are still continuing their advance. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

### Economic Cooperation Among the Four Nordic Countries

The Conservative Party's organ, "Svenska Dagbladet," recently reported that the four countries of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland have each established special committees within their countries to prepare economically for the above-mentioned mutual assistance measures. This was initiated by Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

### Measures to Prohibit Volunteer Support for Spain

Provisionally Effective This Saturday; Monitoring Plan to Be Implemented Next Month

[London] The Sub-Committee of the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War met this afternoon and immediately decided that: ❶ The measures to prohibit the dispatch of volunteers to Spain should take effect this Saturday; ❷ The monitoring plan should take effect from midnight on March 6, but the technical details can be revised by experts, taking into account Portugal's attitude. The Adjustment Committee is scheduled to hold a plenary meeting at 4:30 p.m. tomorrow to submit the previous decision for approval. It is understood that Italian Ambassador Grandi informed the Committee before the Sub-Committee meeting that Italy was willing to immediately conclude an agreement on the prohibition of sending volunteers to Spain. This attitude was the main reason for the Sub-Committee's decision. Portugal has accepted the implementation of the prohibition of volunteers, but has reservations about the implementation of the monitoring plan. The various delegations now believe that the decisions adopted by the Sub-Committee today will enable the naval powers of Britain, France, Germany and Italy to divide the Spanish waters into zones for monitoring. As March 6 is imminent, the Soviet Union does not have time to prepare, so its fleet is effectively unable to participate. In addition, if Portugal does not accept the monitoring plan, its waters will also be included in the monitoring scope of the British, French, German and Italian navies. As the attitudes of the countries concerned are now more consistent on the implementation of monitoring, Portugal will eventually accept the compromise proposed by Britain. According to the compromise proposed by Britain, Portugal would send its own personnel to monitor the border between Portugal and Spain and the ports of Portugal, assisted by British inspectors. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

### World Cotton Production Statistics

Increases in China, the United States, and Russia

[Rome] The International Institute of Agriculture announced statistics stating that cotton production in China, the United States, and the Soviet Union has increased this year, so that world cotton production will increase by 10 million metric tons compared to last year, to 66 million metric tons. The current cotton inventory is about 28 million metric tons. Economic experts believe that although cotton production will increase, prices will not fall, because the countries with the largest increase in production are China and the Soviet Union, which used to be in short supply. Therefore, there will be no overproduction in the future. In addition, the demand situation in various places is also satisfactory. The prices of various other major raw materials have also increased, so cotton prices will not fall. (National Telegram, 15th)

### Japanese Diet Questions Finance and Military Affairs

Army Minister Declares Efforts to Rectify the Military, Navy Minister Guarantees Absolute Non-Interference in Politics

[Tokyo] The Japanese Diet continued smoothly today. The various political parties were extremely cautious, trying to avoid conflict. It can now be confidently predicted that most of the questions in the House of Peers will be about the budget and human rights issues, while the House of Representatives will mainly focus on ❶ researching national economic issues, ❷ establishing currency policy issues, ❸ curbing soaring prices, and methods to alleviate the rural economy. Seiyukai member Miyawaki Nagayoshi raised questions about military reduction and military interference in politics, and the atmosphere in the entire house suddenly became tense. Miyawaki listed examples to prove that the rectification of the military was unsatisfactory and that military interference in politics violated military discipline, demanding a clear answer from the Army Minister. At that time, shouts arose, with some shouting, "Too much talk will lead to dissolution!" At the same time, those who supported Miyawaki asked him to raise as many questions as possible, making the audience feel that there was a danger of an incident occurring. Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa first took the podium to answer, saying that no one in the Navy absolutely interferes in politics, and that there will never be such an act in the future. As he said this, applause and cheers erupted, deafening. Yonai then made an important statement, saying that Japan absolutely does not want to be the world's largest naval power. Army Minister Sugiyama Gen then took the podium to answer, saying that he is now engaged in thorough efforts to rectify the military. He has made this determination, and as he has been appointed Army Minister, his subordinates will inevitably have matters to report to him in their duties, but they cannot be allowed to express anything externally. After the Army Minister finished speaking, the house also responded with applause. That such serious questions could be concluded peacefully further shows the current intentions of the political parties. (Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 16th)

### The Lin Cabinet's Policy Toward China

Superficial Goodwill, Active Undertones

[Tokyo] Prime Minister Lin, in his capacity as Foreign Minister, gave a speech on foreign policy in the Diet on the 15th, focusing on diplomacy toward China, actively advocating the necessity of Sino-Japanese friendship, saying, "In order to clarify Sino-Japanese relations, it is not only necessary for the government to make efforts to understand each other's positions, but also to make frequent contacts between the people to promote the actual results of Sino-Japanese cooperation and assistance. At the same time, we will proceed to eliminate anything that hinders Sino-Japanese cooperation." These words indicate that the Lin Cabinet's policy toward China is based on goodwill work, but in order to achieve this goal, it does not hesitate to implement resolute measures.

❶ The phrase "quasi-wartime finance" often seems to imply that finance is preparing for war, while diplomacy is useless. What is the truth?

❶ The government has revised the budget to curb rising prices, but can reducing local grant money reduce production prices? It is expected to delay and follow the old top plan, which is unacceptable and violates the constitution.

❶ Due to the increase in defense spending and the increase in public debt, the cost of living stabilization has been reduced. What financial plan does the government have for this?

❶ Regarding financial issues, is there a plan for private industry funds to support Manchuria, in addition to budgetary funds? What is the reason for the government's reduction in funding to the South Manchuria Railway?

Finance Minister Yuki answered:

I am deeply concerned about the balance between military expenditure and the stabilization of national life. To alleviate the poverty of rural areas, debt reorganization is most important. Therefore, regarding the grant system, I hope to temporarily leave room for consideration. As for the prediction of future finances, I said yesterday that there is no certainty. This is due to the current social situation, which is unavoidable. I have tried to compare the era of Finance Minister Takahashi with the era of Finance Minister Baba, trying to reconcile the financial policies of the two, but whether it will succeed is uncertain. He made extremely skeptical remarks, met with a mixture of laughter and applause.

Mr. Ota took the podium again, stating the uneven burden between urban and rural areas, and expressed dissatisfaction with the tax increase.

Miyazawa Taneji (Minseito) questioned the government's views on finance, industry, and small and medium-sized enterprise policies. At that time, there were few Seiyukai members in the seats, but Mr. Miyazawa continued to vigorously advocate the necessity of investing in Manchuria, and what production policies should be implemented for small and medium-sized enterprises.

Finance Minister Yuki answered:

The government intends to continue implementing the same low-interest policy as the previous cabinet. As for the adverse effects of this reversal, we should cooperate with all parties to prevent it.

Next, Minister of Commerce Godo, Minister of Agriculture Yamazaki, and others made replies. Then, Prime Minister Lin answered as follows:

If investment in Manchuria is necessary, we will do our best to promote its activities. As for stabilizing the people's livelihood, I also have the same concern.

Mr. Miyazawa took the stage again, saying:

The Prime Minister only said that he has the same feeling, but I don't know what plan he has. If it is only a feeling, then the Diet will not be able to proceed with deliberations.

Finance Minister Yuki answered on his behalf as follows: The method is being considered, but it cannot be explained here, because it is not yet the time to explain.

Miyawaki Nagayoshi (Seiyukai) raised questions about national defense spending, military rectification, and military interference in politics. The Diet then became tense. He said that recently a small number of military personnel have been interfering in politics. If the government does not take a decisive attitude, it will inevitably lead to unexpected situations in the future. The military ministers should set an example and regulate them.

Navy Minister Yonai answered:

The Imperial Japanese Navy strives to stabilize East Asia without being threatened by other countries, nor invading other countries, and does not engage in arms races with other countries, nor does it want to build the only navy in the world. As for the issue of military rectification, we will make more efforts in the future to ensure the Sacred Decree is implemented without error.

Army Minister Sugiyama took the stage with an excited expression and answered as follows:

The national defense expenditure is as stated in the budget for the 12th year of Showa. As for the detailed figures, they concern military equipment and are not suitable for explanation. As for military rectification, since the era of Minister Terauchi, we have been diligently working towards this goal. I believe that this matter has not yet been completed and must be worked on in the future. As for where the outbreak of the February 26th Incident came from, there are many aspects that the entire nation should reflect on. Military interference in politics has been seriously cautioned against since the time of the previous minister.

Prime Minister Lin answered:

Military personnel should not interfere in politics in their duties, but ministers can of course interfere in politics in their duties.

Mr. Miyawaki also said, "Please do not allow a small number of military personnel to interfere in politics, so as to correct today's bad habits, and I hope that a diplomatic policy will be established based on national defense." Prime Minister Lin, who also served as Foreign Minister, answered that he would engage in coordination and avoid disrupting. Thus, the Q&A on military rectification temporarily came to an end.

Hamano Tetsutaro of the Minseito Party believed that the failure of the Song Yuyuan Cabinet, and the requirement that the military ministers be limited to active-duty generals or lieutenant generals, and the issue of requiring them to leave the party, were serious cases of military interference in politics, and questioned the reasons.

Army Minister Sugiyama answered:

It is a misunderstanding to think that the military interfered with the formation of the Cabinet of General Song Yuan. The three chiefs had already selected candidates, but all of the candidates resigned. Limiting the military ministers to active-duty generals or lieutenant generals is to take responsibility for the current state of military progress. It is necessary to know that the situation within the military must be absolute. It would be inconvenient for retired officers. Prime Minister Lin answered that he did not exclude political parties, and that there were many concurrent cabinet members, which was by no means imitating Western fascism, and that there were other reasons. I am willing to respect the constitution and implement unique constitutional politics. The meeting adjourned at 6:26 p.m.

[Tokyo] The House of Peers convened at 10 a.m. today. Tokubo first took the stage and listed examples of torture and human rights violations that occurred in various prefectures during the general election of the House of Representatives the year before last, hoping to eradicate torture and the actions of the police before stepping down. There was applause. Interior Minister Kawarada took the podium to answer, saying that it was a pity that such torture incidents occurred frequently in the Sacred Age, and the government would eradicate this inauspicious incident in the future. Next, Kanahara Michiyuki raised financial issues and took the stage to ask questions, raising long questions about the new budget and tax increases, but it was only a question in the style of the House of Peers. Thus, the stage for the Q&A battle shifted to the House of Representatives in the afternoon. (Dispatch from Domei, 16th)

### Suzuki, President of the Party, Decides to Resign

Seiyukai Executives Discuss Follow-Up

[Tokyo] The Seiyukai held a joint meeting of advisors, executive directors, and secretaries-general at 10 a.m. on the 16th to discuss follow-up matters, as Suzuki, the president, had decided to resign. They decided on the timing of the president's resignation and the specific methods. According to general observation, a general affairs committee system will be implemented after the president's resignation as a temporary measure. (Dispatch from Domei, 16th)

[Tokyo] After Suzuki, the president of the Seiyukai, expressed his intention to resign, the Joint Council of Advisors and General Affairs believes that there is no other way than to accept his resignation, but they must listen to his opinions on handling the aftermath in order to follow them. It was decided that the executive committee would be responsible for handling the follow-up. Secretary-General Ando visited President Suzuki at 2 p.m. on the 16th to report on the progress of the Joint Council and discuss follow-up measures. It is believed that there is no one within the party who enjoys widespread popularity at present. Most people advocate the establishment of an acting committee, and the candidates for this small number of committee members are most likely to be Ichiro Hatoyama, Yonezo Maeda, Toshio Shimada, and Chikyūhei Nakajima, who are all influential. There is also an argument for adding a member from the House of Peers, but the number of committee members has not yet been decided. The situation within the party is extremely complicated, with some advocating for complete liberation and others actively engaging in new party movements. It is difficult to predict what will happen next. The future of the Seiyukai is attracting much attention from all sides. (Dispatch from Domei, 16th)

### Siberian Railway Accelerates Double-Tracking

To Be Completed This Spring; Militarily Important

[Moscow] The second line of the Far Eastern Railway has been laid with standard gauge and station sidings totaling 3,500 kilometers, with about 600 kilometers remaining to be built from Boli to Voroshilov City. As of New Year's Day this year, 63.5 million cubic meters of earthwork and 870,000 cubic meters of construction work have been completed. Thousands of bridges and other structures have been built. Many locomotive and car repair shops and machine factories have been built. Thousands of houses, dining rooms, schools, clubs, hospitals, kindergartens, and nurseries have also been built. As of the beginning of this year, 1,126,000 cubic meters of various masonry houses and 1,716,000 cubic meters of wooden houses have been built. The terrain, geology, and climate of the construction area are extremely difficult. Most of the line must pass through mountains, cross dozens of large rivers, and thousands of small rivers and streams. The winter lasts for seven months each year, sometimes with temperatures reaching minus 50 degrees Celsius. In the summer, the entire line is continuously rainy, and most areas are even frozen all year round. The Soviet Union is building this second line for the purpose of developing the national economy of the Far East. After its completion, the economic development of the Far Eastern region will be even more rapid. (Dispatch from TASS, 15th)

### United States Sets Up Restrictions to Prevent Foreign Capital Inflow

Although the Ministry of Finance Has Recently Purchased Large Amounts of Silver, It Has Not Reached the Ratio of One Gold to Five Silver

[Washington] Treasury officials allowed tonight that they would soon decide on methods to deal with the excessive amount of foreign capital that has recently flowed into the United States. There is currently approximately 75 billion yuan of foreign capital in the United States. If it is suddenly withdrawn due to domestic or foreign environmental reasons, it will pose a danger to the internal credit institutions of the United States. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau held a meeting with Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Landis and Federal Reserve Chairman Eccles today to discuss the matter. After the meeting, it was announced that the government should take action within a few days. (National Telegram, 15th)

[Washington] Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told Congress today that the large amount of cash flowing into the United States has made it difficult for the Treasury Department to succeed in its efforts to prepare the currency area to a ratio of three gold to one silver. Although the Treasury Department has purchased as much silver as possible, it has only reached the ratio of one gold to five silver so far. The Treasury Secretary said that since the implementation of the Silver Purchase Act, the Treasury Department has purchased 1,139,194,172 ounces of silver. (National Telegram, 15th)

### Military Expenditures of Various Countries in the Past Two Years

Doubled; Germany Increased Fivefold

[Washington] The Foreign Policy Association announced today that Germany's military expenditures increased more than fivefold between 1934 and 1936, while the world's military expenditures doubled, estimated at US$11,000,000,000. Military budgets of various countries began to increase after Japan invaded Manchuria, and increased even faster after Hitler seized power in Germany. Today, military expenditures of various countries uniformly assume that war is about to break out. From 1934 to 1936, the military expenditures of various countries were as follows: The Soviet Union increased from $1,000,000,000 to $2,963,100,000; the United States increased from $710,000,000 to $964,900,000; France increased from $582,700,000 to $716,400,000; Britain increased from $480,600,000 to $846,900,000; Germany increased from $381,800,000 to $2,600,000,000; Japan increased from $271,900,000 to $307,900,000; Italy increased from $263,700,000 to $807,800,000.

The recent conclusion of a friendship treaty between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria is particularly gratifying, because this friendship treaty not only creates a good future for Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, but is also beneficial to all Balkan Peninsula countries." It was then that Yugoslav Foreign Minister Stojadinović, who took over as Chairman of this conference after the Turkish Foreign Minister, delivered a reply, stating that the situation in the Balkan Peninsula had greatly improved, which should be attributed to the Balkan consultations. According to informed sources, the representatives of the Balkan Entente countries discussed the general political situation yesterday, especially the situation created by the Spanish events, and recorded the two facts that the cooperation between Britain and France is becoming closer and closer and the danger of a European war is gradually decreasing. In addition, there will be some requests regarding the repercussions caused by the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean agreement. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

### Hitler Interferes in Religious Dispute

Orders Religious Minister to Prepare for Believer Elections

[Berlin] German leader Hitler is now intervening in the religious dispute. Today, he issued an order stating that because the German Religious Committee has failed to reach a compromise among the pastor groups, the church must establish a new system to enjoy complete freedom and follow the wishes of religious believers. The order also instructs Religious Minister Kerrl to prepare for a general election of pastors to achieve this goal. (Central News Agency, 16th, Reuters)

[Berlin] German leader Hitler today intervened in the disputes among various factions of the German Church, ordering 40 million Christians to vote and decide on the guidelines of the German Church, to see whether the church should obey the doctrines set by the National Socialist Party. According to reports, the old guard and extreme National Socialist believers in the church have been in dispute for a long time. The resignation of the entire administrative committee of the church appointed by the government has pushed the situation to extremes. The three issues that believers are now voting on are: ㊀ Should the church become a tool of the state? ㊁ Should the church promote the gospel of racial purity? ㊂ Should the Old Testament be revised? Hitler's order was issued in the name of Religious Minister Kerrl. Hitler has always avoided direct intervention in church affairs, so this action is noteworthy. (15th, National Telegram)

### Kallio Elected President of Finland

Helsinki, Finland: President Svinhufvud was elected on February 16, 1931, for a six-year term, which has now expired. The Parliament (Finland has a unicameral system) voted to elect Speaker Kallio, leader of the Agrarian League, as the new president. (15th, Havas)

Helsinki, Finland: Prime Minister Kallio was elected as the new president with 177 out of 300 votes. Kallio is 64 years old, a member of the Agrarian League, and a farmer. He was elected as a Senator in 1918 and has since served as a minister, speaker of parliament, and prime minister. He is a prominent figure in Finland, and the 1918 agricultural reform law is particularly well-known. (15th, National Telegram)

[Berlin] People in the local state party are quite surprised that former President Svinhufvud failed to be re-elected in the Finnish presidential election. It is generally expected that the Kivimäki cabinet will resign on March 1, and a left-wing cabinet will be formed to succeed it. Svinhufvud is one of the leading figures in Finland, and is regarded here as the "Hindenburg of Finland". (15th, Havas)

### Chinese Ship Runs Aground Near Makung Island

Makung: A report came in suddenly at 9 a.m. yesterday that a foreign transport ship had run aground in the southeast of Yupu.

Due to rudder failure, it was drifted by wind and waves, causing it to run aground. There was no other intention. One crew member is also missing. (16th, Allied Press)

### U.S. Navy Major Leaks Military Secrets

Tried by Federal Court, Involving Two Japanese Officers

[Washington] U.S. Navy Major Francis Weisswager, who was arrested on July 14 last year on charges of conspiring to leak naval secrets to Japan, was interrogated today by the Federal Court. Weisswager declared that he would not defend himself against the charge of espionage. Weisswager's arrest involved two Japanese naval officers, but both were not arrested due to their special status as diplomats. These two Japanese, formerly stationed at the Japanese Embassy, have probably returned to Japan. More than 50 U.S. Navy personnel have come here from various naval bases to prepare for testimony. The military police had been secretly investigating Weisswager for months before his arrest. (Central News Agency, 15th, Reuters)

### Petition from Gansu Relief Representatives to the Central Government

Reports on the Bandit Situation in the Province and Requests Allocation of Large Sums for Relief

Beijing News: Gansu has suffered from natural disasters and man-made calamities in recent years, resulting in an extremely dire situation. Recently, the relief representatives from the province, Shui Zigao and Wen Wei, presented a detailed report to the central government on the disaster situation and requested relief. The original text of the petition is transcribed below:

"We have investigated and found that Gansu is a poor and sparsely populated area. Since the 16th and 17th years of the Republic of China, it has suffered from repeated disasters, and its vitality has not yet recovered. Unfortunately, the desperate communist bandits have entered Gansu one after another, ravaging the entire province. The disaster situation is extremely severe and unprecedented. The general situation of the disaster areas and losses is presented in detail below:

Disaster Areas

In the 23rd year, the communist bandits Liu Zidan, Yang Sen, and others occupied the five prefectures of Longdong and Qingyang. In the 24th year, the bandit leaders Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, Xu Haidong, and others entered the area from southern Shaanxi and northern Sichuan, dividing their forces to harass the 30-odd counties in southeastern Longdong. Last year, the bandit leaders Zhu De, Xu Xiangqian, Xiao Ke, He Long, and others entered the country with their entire force from northern Sichuan, passing through the Tao River basin, harassing the north and south of Longdong, and dividing their forces to flee to Hexi. The cities and towns they captured include Lintan, Zhangxian, Weiyuan, Chengxian, Huixian, Liangdang, Tongwei, Huining, Longde, Chongxin, Huanxian, Heshui, Kangxian, Jingtai, Gulang, Yongchang, Minle, Linze, Shanzhou, Gaotai, and other 20 counties. The counties that suffered the most severe damage include Minxian, Lintao, Longxi, Wushan, Gangu, Tianshui, Tai'an, Dingxi, Jingning, Zhuanglang, Xihe, Lixian, Huating, Huaping, Pingliang, Jingchuan, Zhengning, Ningxian, Qingyang, Zhenyuan, Haiyuan, Guyuan, Jingyuan, Yongdeng, Wuwei, Minqin, Zhangye, and other 27 counties. The next most severely affected areas include Gaolan, Yuzhong, Kangle, Xiahe, Qingshui, Lingtai, Wudu, Xizhou, and other ten-odd counties, which have also been harmed. Of the 68 counties in Gansu Province, the number of disaster-stricken counties is almost 60, making nearly the entire province a disaster area.

Disaster Losses

Gansu is purely an agricultural province, and industry and commerce have never been developed. Farmers' savings are limited to grain and livestock. The communist bandits Liu Zidan, Mao Zedong, and others occupied the Longdong area for two or three years, and had already looted everything. Last year, Zhu De, Xu Xiangqian, and other bandits passed through the barren areas of Songpan and Mao'ergai, and were exhausted. Once they entered Gansu, they not only looted all the grain and livestock, but also dug up all the farmers' hidden property. Excluding the losses in Hexi, which have not yet been investigated and confirmed, the losses in the southeastern Longdong counties are estimated at more than 2,155,400 shi of grain and more than 10,376,000 heads of livestock. The value of other losses is not less than that of food and livestock. As for the direct disaster-stricken population, it has reached three to four million, accounting for more than half of the total population of Gansu. If we include the people indirectly affected by the bandit disasters, it can be said that the entire province has become a disaster area.

Based on the above-mentioned disaster areas and losses, the disaster situation in Gansu is extremely serious. Just as the Shaanxi-Gansu Incident occurred, transportation was cut off, and food prices soared. Many disaster victims have died of cold and starvation. In the blink of an eye, it will be spring plowing, and there is a lack of seeds, cattle, and horses. I am afraid that crops will be lost again, and the disaster will become more and more severe. In November of this year, the government approved the allocation of 300,000 yuan in public value, which is equivalent to less than 200,000 yuan in cash. This is a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem. The representatives are petitioning on behalf of the people, and they should send a detailed document with the statistical table of bandit disaster losses in Gansu to your council for consideration. They implore you to have compassion on the disaster-stricken people in the border areas and approve the allocation of a large sum of relief funds to provide assistance. We are extremely urgent and await your orders."

### Suzhou

High Court Investigates Sex Scandal

Zhang Yongquan, the young owner of Zhang Xiangfeng Candy Store outside the Changmen Gate, is dissolute and extravagant. Recently, a young woman named Chen Yichun sued him in the District Court for violating public morals and accused Shi Renlin, an employee of the Zhenguang Great Crying Court, of assisting him in the crime. The District Court Prosecutor He Jingcen summoned Zhang Yongquan and Shi Renlin to court and detained them for investigation and suspended visitation. Zhang's father, Zuiqiao, repeatedly requested bail but was refused. On the 4th of this month, bail was approved. At that time, a citizen named Wang Zhaojie submitted a complaint to the High Court, stating that Prosecutor He's sudden approval of bail for Zhang and Shi was suspicious and requested a thorough investigation. On the 9th of this month, the District Prosecutor's Office summoned Zhang Yongquan and Shi Renlin to court, detained them, and immediately filed a public prosecution. Zhang Yongquan was charged with raping a girl under the age of sixteen, and Shi Renlin was charged with aiding the crime. The District Court will hold a public hearing in the coming days. As for Wang Zhaojie's request for a thorough investigation of the prosecutor, the High Court Prosecutor summoned Zhang Zuiqiao and others on the afternoon of the 16th and Prosecutor Peng opened the court for investigation. He then ordered them to wait for a scheduled retrial.

### Wuxi

Chamber of Commerce Requests Exemption from Business Tax

The Chambers of Commerce of Zhenjiang, Wujin, Wuxi, Kunshan, Wuxian, Taicang, Changshu, Jiangyin, Yixing, and other counties believe that since the income tax is being implemented, merchants in various regions should unanimously support it. However, the current business tax must be levied regardless of profit or loss, and the laws of various provinces are not consistent. There are many conflicts with the income tax. According to the previous secret resolution in Shanghai, they jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to request a suspension of the tax in order to reduce the burden on merchants. In addition, the Wuxi Cotton Textile Industry Association stated that the industry has been suppressed for years due to the influence of high prices and cheap sales, and has suffered heavy losses. Although there was a slight improvement last year and there was hope for recovery, it is still difficult to make up for previous losses. The amount of consolidated tax paid, based on the seven factories in Wuxi County alone, is more than one million yuan per year. According to the principle of levying consolidated tax, those who have paid consolidated tax should no longer pay other taxes. Now that the spinning industry has just begun to breathe, it does not seem appropriate to levy income tax on its profits. Yesterday, they specially telegraphed the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee to request exemption. In addition, the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce stated that there are many issues to be studied and discussed regarding the newly implemented income tax. It is specifically scheduled for 3:00 p.m. on the 20th of this month to invite Weng Zhiyong, director of the Jiangsu Office of Income Tax, and accountants Pan Xulun and Li Wenjie from the Lixin Accounting Firm to give lectures at the meeting. Notice has been given to all industries to attend the lectures at that time.

### Taizhou

Yingyu of Wenling Profitable

According to the usual practice of Wenling Yingyu, the year-end closing date is at the end of the old calendar year. Last year, due to the rising prices of goods, many Yingyu were more profitable. It was easy to collect Yingyu loans. Each Yingyu earned tens of thousands of dollars.

### The Truth about the So-Called Chinese People's Front and a Review of Its Theories (Continued)

— Luo Meihuan

"Some people misunderstand the United Front, thinking that since we are standing together, there is no need for any disputes among our allies..."

"The United Front absolutely does not eliminate the contradictions within the Front, and the United Front itself exists and continues in constant struggle. Disputes among allies are still an undeniable fact. The use of strategies and tactics is itself a process of struggle. It can be said that the internal survival and development of the United Front depends entirely on this kind of struggle... Therefore, because of the union, fearing internal struggle and avoiding the necessary disputes is not only not beneficial to the United Front, but also a kind of disloyalty to the common sacred war..."

(The above is from Liu Di's Basic Understanding of Saving the Nation)

This is the true meaning of their advocacy of unity. We know that on the one hand, they oppose "the theory of weapons alone" and advocate immediate resistance against Japan. On the other hand, they advocate that during the resistance against Japan, while resisting foreign aggression, they should also engage in internal struggles. This kind of omnipotent tactic has probably never been seen in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad. The result of this kind of unity is not saving the nation but destroying it, it is inviting internal chaos rather than unifying to resist foreign aggression, and it is clearly a dead end.

They believe that China's war of resistance against Japan must be led by the Chinese Communist Party. Those who do not share their ideas are first deceived into joining them, but during the process of uniting, they must be absolutely controlled by them. If you are not controlled, they will start internal struggles, until it is completed and everything is uniform. They say: "Because the movement becomes more and more pure, elite, and large as it progresses. The true warriors can only be cultivated and tempered in this process." (See Liu Zhi's "Putting Thousands of Bullets on One Target.") What is meant by pure and large, what is meant by cultivating and tempering, can be understood without saying so.

Therefore, the United Front is the Communist Front. Those within the union are their cat's paws. Before the resistance against Japan is completed, they have already decided to eat you up, only seeking to expand their red terror forces, only to repay their motherland, the Communist International. They are not stingy at all to sacrifice the country and the nation.

Second: It is mobilizing the masses for riots, not arming the masses.

To cope with the national crisis, it is of course necessary to mobilize the people of the whole country to arm themselves and resist the enemy. The prerequisite for arming the people is to first provide them with basic military knowledge and training. The meaning of the government's handling of military training in recent years lies in this, and it has already achieved good results. This is something that every citizen should be proud of. However, those in the People's Front, who have ulterior motives, are on the one hand calling for arming the people, but on the other hand they oppose the government's implementation of military training. Please see their incitement against military training:

"Now the tricks are new again, military training, military training, busy all day long, busy all day long to make your body and mind exhausted, but teach people to say to work hard to build national defense" (Li Gongpu, editor-in-chief of Chinese Voice Collection, Chapter 16)

"The people are destitute, that is, the whole country is a soldier, and all the money in the country is used to buy airplanes and cannons, but how can you walk if you are hungry? How can you pick up a gun." (Gao Shiqi's letter to the consumptive masses)

To cope with the national crisis, should everyone endure a little hardship? How does the hardship of military training compare to the soldiers fighting against the cold and blood in front? The people's livelihood is one thing, and the country should think of ways to provide relief. Is it because the people's livelihood is difficult, that the country does not need to be saved, that national defense does not need to be established, and that the enemy's airplanes and cannons can arbitrarily oppress us? This is something that people in the People's Front know very well. Their intention is to riot the masses, not to arm the masses, because rioting the masses is the Communist Party's specialty, because rioting the masses can achieve their purpose of taking advantage of the chaos. The government's handling of military training, so that the people of the whole country are in step, is the benefit of the country, but it is the harm of the Communist Party. Their reason for opposing military training and opposing enriching national defense lies here. The true meaning of their high-sounding armed masses resisting the enemy and saving the country also lies here.

Third: They want to create a separatist situation.

They are full of talk about unity, full of talk about union, but the method they actually practice is to think of creating a separatist situation. They say:

"...and then the parties open a joint conference, in the local government, the factual government, I think the first step is to recognize each other's existence, give all parties' governments the power of great autonomy, and also from party negotiations to local government negotiations and cooperation, in the local armed forces, also adopt the above methods, to achieve cooperation and unity." - Li Gongpu's Political National Defense Mobilization

This completely plagiarizes the old tune of the United Provinces Autonomy of more than ten years ago. In theory it is untenable, and in fact, except for a few red bandits like fish in a cauldron, all the local governments and all the local masses in the country are strongly led by the Kuomintang. What else is there to talk about, what else is there to cooperate? What else is there to recognize each other's existence? In order to demand the existence of a few communist bandits, they sang the proposition of division and provoked the local government's feelings towards the central government. This is the conscientious proposition that the People's Front people advocate every day.

Fourth: Regarding the issue of Chinese people not fighting Chinese people

It is right that Chinese people do not fight Chinese people, but there should be a limit to it. That is, all traitors and bandits who endanger the country and the nation, although they have the blood relationship of the Chinese nation, but we should be banished from the country and the nation and absolutely cannot be regarded as Chinese people, and absolutely cannot apply the sentence "Chinese people do not fight Chinese people" to this group of people. Not only that, but we should also fight them, so that they can be eliminated, so as not to be an obstacle to foreign countries. For example, Yin Rugeng and his ilk, is he not a "descendant of the Yellow Emperor", does he not promote autonomous nation-building? If we also talk about Chinese people not fighting Chinese people with Yin Rugeng and his ilk, wouldn't it be a joke?

The People's Front shouting out this slogan is naturally aimed at the red bandits, but the fact that the red bandits cannot become Chinese people has already been proven by iron-like facts. In terms of their beliefs, their motherland is the Communist International, not the Republic of China. They no longer have the concept of the Chinese nation. How can people without the concept of the Chinese nation be considered Chinese? Furthermore, in terms of their actions: for more than ten years, they have brutally killed innocent people, burned down houses, and caused banditry in more than ten provinces, losing immeasurable national strength, thereby inviting the oppression of foreign aggression. They are actively working to reduce the number of Chinese people and Chinese national strength, creating opportunities for the enemy to invade. Can this kind of action be counted as Chinese people? If those who shout internationalism can be counted as Chinese people, then how can those who advocate Pan-Asianism not be counted as Chinese people? If recognizing the Communist Party, which uses terrorist policies to establish a Soviet, is Chinese, then how can various pseudo-organizations in the Northeast and Hebei, which promote autonomy, not be recognized as Chinese? Therefore, talking about "Chinese people not fighting Chinese people" with the Chinese Communist Party is as absurd as talking about Chinese people not fighting Chinese people" with pseudo-organizations.

Uniting the truly patriotic Chinese people to eliminate the sham patriotic Chinese people who betray the country and the nation is our legitimate way to strive for survival.

From the above, we know that the People's Front is the Communist Front, and we know that the proposition of the People's Front is a proposition that poisons the country and the nation. Standing on the position of "Chinese people," we can only relentlessly eliminate it. At the same time, we hope that the general followers who echo what others say will quickly wake up and throw themselves under the banner of the Three Principles of the People, taking on the responsibility of saving the country.

Some may say that the Chinese Communist Party has been eking out a precarious existence in recent years, and seems to have awakened a little. If they sincerely resist the enemy, then for the sake of uniting forces, it does not seem appropriate to refuse too much. Actually, it is not so. First: the Communist Party absolutely has no concept of credibility and morality. They participated in the Kuomintang revolution for eleven years and once swore to implement the Kuomintang's political platform, but as soon as they had a little power, they wanted to eliminate the Kuomintang. This is the lesson of past tolerance of communism. First: They have had anti-Japanese propaganda since September 18, and there are various names such as the Anti-Japanese Advance Team and the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. On the surface, it seems that they are also generous and enthusiastic for the country, but during the Anti-Japanese War on September 18, the National Army in Jiangxi was ordered to transfer to Shanghai to participate in the war, but as soon as it arrived in Nanchang, the Communist Party launched a full-scale attack on Ji'an. Later, the National Army returned to Ji'an and defeated the Communist Party, but because the aid to Shanghai was late, it ended the Battle of Shanghai. This not only proves that they do not have the slightest intention to resist the enemy, but also try their best to contain the National Army's anti-Japanese progress. They are now repeating the old tune, but it is just the intention of playing the lute and singing. We must never be fooled again. If they are truly awake, the government already has regulations for "self-renewal," and they still have the opportunity to surrender. As for advocating divided opposition—union, then we only have to implement the proposition of securing the interior first before resisting foreign aggression, so as not to directly restrain the opposition.

### Securities

The Situation Creates a Surge in Government Bonds

Up from Seventy Cents to Two Dollars and Forty Cents; Class A Bonds Expected to Sell for Eighty Dollars

Yesterday's price increase on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was unprecedented in months. The buying interest on the trading floor was extremely strong. Although sellers were selling, they were very strict on price and dared not let go. Some were still going in after selling, because in general, people have the same view on the future of prices. Government bonds are one of the chips, and the increase in capital of Tongming Industrial Bank is also for the 10 million yuan of Reconstruction Bonds, so there is no reason to underestimate them. Although various prices have reached new highs, Class A bonds are still relatively weak. Some people expect Class A bonds to reach eighty dollars in the future, which is an exaggeration. However, due to the shortage of goods, there are also considerable reasons. The opening was the strongest yesterday, especially the domestic ones, which rose by one dollar and six and a half cents, were the strongest. Nos. 4, 6, 11, 10, and 47 were all being bought in, covering shorts and making new positions, swarming at once. There were more sellers of only Nos. 3 and 5, and the rest were small transactions. The deficit on the list before the market was still strong, and it was slightly weaker from the domestic long position, but there was still a continuation of the rise, and each price was raised, and the situation did not weaken. The total result of the two trading sessions showed that the price rose from 70 cents to two dollars and forty cents. The total number of transactions was 12 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared and listed on the left. (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 Yuan)

### Yarn Flower

People share the same sentiment, how can yarn prices not be high?

Futures are used for speculation; spot goods are used for hoarding.

The yarn market is trending firm, and the price surge is intense because people are thinking about mitigating potential losses by seeking value in rising prices. Consequently, yarn, cotton, flour, and wheat have become top speculative commodities. Furthermore, powerful individuals are also hoarding spot goods, which drives up futures prices and fuels enthusiastic demand for actual yarn. Merchants from inland Yunnan and other regions are particularly active in procuring these goods, further bolstering market sentiment. The financial sector has re-engaged in vigorous absorption, tightening the market further, and propelling prices upward.

Tagged Yarn Jumps Three to Four Yuan

In the morning session, tagged yarn prices rose across all months due to positive news from the previous day. Massive buying from the financial sector caused a shortage of available stock. Prices then increased again. However, as some in the industry continued to increase holdings of yarn in their warehouses, the Osaka Sanpin yarn market saw a decline, leading to calmer market sentiment and a tendency towards selling, which slightly weakened prices. As a result, prices for all months rose by 1.10 to 1.34 yuan compared to the previous day's closing prices. The afternoon session saw continued price increases, driven by heavy buying from the financial sector and widespread rumors. After the second round of trading, raw cotton prices rose, igniting a strong buying frenzy, and prices surged further. Traders bought in the morning and sold in the afternoon. Sales included 1,450 bales from Jifeng, 950 bales from Guyi, 2,200 bales from Yuda, 1,950 bales from Jinchang, 1,450 bales from Mingde, 2,450 bales from Hexing, 1,350 bales from Gengfeng, 3,950 bales from Yichang, 2,750 bales from Runkang, 1,300 bales from Fukang, and 1,000 bales from Yongda. Purchases included 3,800 bales from Dafu, 5,450 bales from Tongji, 1,350 bales from Yukang, 1,650 bales from Senkang, 4,000 bales from Yuanyi, 2,650 bales from Dachangcheng, 1,000 bales from Shengyuan, and 1,850 bales from Fengtai.

Spot Yarn Sales Improve

Daily statistics show that various merchants bought a total of 3,168 bales, with selling prices up by 2.3 yuan. The purchase amounts for each merchant are listed below:

Speculative Targets Concentrate on Cotton, Market Prices Soar

Distant May Futures Reach New Highs —14565—

The cotton market is soaring. After a prolonged period of quiet stagnation, any opportunity triggers intense back-and-forth pulling, leading to unstoppable price increases. The market generally believes that the Third Plenary Session will proceed smoothly, leading to strong expectations for rising prices. Consequently, speculators are extremely active, and most targets have shifted to tagged cotton, further fueling the price surge.

Cotton Rises Over One Yuan

In the morning session, tagged cotton prices rose uniformly across all months. Due to numerous rumors and extensive activity, Tongji alone purchased 10,000 dan, tightening the market. All months jumped by 2.2 to 2.3 yuan. However, after the second round of trading, bullish investors took profits, and Indian cotton and other cotton types also declined, resulting in no shortage of sellers. The market then retreated. As a result, prices for all months rose by 0.5 to 0.15 yuan compared to the previous day's closing prices. The afternoon session saw a shift towards brisk trading and strong buying interest. Rumors circulated widely, all pointing to positive developments. The financial sector vigorously bought, intensifying the price surge. Distant May futures reached a new high of 45.65 yuan at closing. As a result, prices for all months rose again by 0.4 to 1 yuan compared to the morning closing prices. Sales included 3,000 dan from Jinchang, 2,800 dan from Daqing, 1,400 dan from Jinyu, 1,300 dan from Taixing, 3,800 dan from Shenchang, 2,300 dan from Taichang, 2,000 dan from Tonghe, 1,900 dan from Xinhua, 1,500 dan from Yuanxingchang, 5,500 dan from Changhe, 4,400 dan from Gongyichang, 4,000 dan from Runkang, and 5,600 dan from Yikang and 5,000 dan from Xinchang. Purchases included 19,400 dan from Tongji, 12,500 dan from Yuda, 3,500 dan from Renfeng, 4,300 dan from Dachangxian, 1,900 dan from Dachang, 2,400 dan from Dafu, 4,400 dan from Gengfeng, 5,400 dan from Fengtai, 8,100 dan from Xincheng, 3,300 dan from Jinghua, and 10,000 dan from Changhe. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed on the left.

Japanese Factories Procure Fine Cotton

Consumption of spot cotton has not yet fully recovered, but factories are gradually becoming more active. This is because the price surge for forward contracts is particularly strong, and the source of supply remains unclear.

U.S. Cotton Market Still Watching Government Actions

Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened with sluggish trading. Traders were mostly awaiting developments in Washington regarding cotton loans and legislative matters. Prices fluctuated from a decline of four points to an increase of one point. Demand for old cotton was strong, with cooperative brokers acting as buyers and few sellers. Forward sales were limited, and there were few new accounts. Later, some sold distant months to offset purchases of cottonseed oil, slightly softening the market. Prices rebounded at closing. Spot prices rose by four points, while futures fell by two to rose by four points. English cotton spot prices fell by six points, and futures fell by four points. Indian cotton initially fell due to selling by futures traders but later rebounded due to buying by European exporters when prices declined. Bengalese declined by 1.5 to 1.5 rupees, Oomra declined by one rupee, and White Broach declined by 2.15 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 15th).

Another telegram from Bombay dated 16th predicts that White Broach will open at 213.5 rupees, Oomra at 205.15 rupees, and Bengalese at 179 rupees, all up by 0.15 rupees.

The outlook for White Factory Red Plate depends on the next two days.

Statistics show that total daily trading volume has reached over 5,000 dan. Among these, materials like factory nails, black iron sheets, tinplate, and new iron wire have seen significant transactions, while sales of scrap iron products have also been substantial. Overseas markets remain solid, and the outlook for the local market remains optimistic. The market prices for various items are listed on the left (unit: yuan).

### The United National Salvation Grand Alliance of All Circles Issued an Important Declaration Yesterday

Telegraph the Nation, Requesting Uniform Advocacy; Petition the Third Plenary Session, Requesting Adoption

The United National Salvation Grand Alliance of All Circles in this city held its inaugural meeting at the Pudong Mansion the night before last. Details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Three documents passed on the spot, including the declaration, the telegram, and the petition to the Third Plenary Session, are excerpted below.

Declaration

In the past twenty years or so, due to the precarious state of the country, some have advocated saving the nation through transportation, and others have advocated saving the nation through education. Since the September 18th Incident, due to the national crisis, people have advocated resisting the enemy to save the nation. However, since the loss of the Eastern Provinces, followed by Rehe, the enemy's forces have crossed the Great Wall to the south, directly entering the suburbs of Peiping and Tianjin. The fate of the country is now extremely critical. The reason for this is that the country has not yet achieved unification, and feudal forces still occupy various regions. For this reason, in the past twenty years or so, we have only seen years of civil war, people unable to support themselves, water conservancy projects not being developed, and natural disasters occurring frequently. There has been more destruction than construction, leading to the decline of all industries and the bankruptcy of rural areas. The enemy has taken advantage of this, resulting in the unprecedented national crisis of the September 18th Incident. For the present, if we want to stop the enemy's invasion and further recover lost territories, we must achieve national unification and centralize power. Even if we want to relieve rural areas, engage in construction, and restore prosperity, unification is essential. As long as local separatist forces exist, not only can civil wars not be stopped and peaceful construction cannot proceed, but also the nation's strength will be consumed in civil war, making external resistance impossible. In the summer of last year, because of the unification of Guangdong and Guangxi, we were able to reject the enemy's harsh demands and resist the invasion of Suiyuan by the bandit army under the enemy's command. Later, the Xi'an Incident occurred, causing the construction efforts in the Northwest over the years to suffer greatly, and the preliminary unification of the country was almost destroyed. Fortunately, the Xi'an Incident has now been peacefully resolved, but there is no need to hide the fact that national unification has not been consolidated and separatist forces still exist. We believe that at this time, when the national crisis is deep and the crisis is imminent, there is no way to save the country without completing the true unification of the nation. To achieve unification, the responsibility of leadership naturally lies with the government. However, if people from all walks of life can unite and use the power of public opinion and morality to jointly impose severe sanctions on traitors and warlords who undermine unification, the unification of the nation will surely become more consolidated day by day. May all the wise people in the country rise together to complete the great cause of national unification.

Telegram

To all newspaper offices and fellow countrymen: The national crisis is severe, reaching its extreme today. The root cause of this is the inability to unify the country, which leads to the dispersal of strength, allowing the enemy to take advantage of gaps and carry out their cunning schemes of devouring and defeating us one by one. The events before the September 18th and January 28th incidents are still vivid in our minds. Recognizing this, various groups in Shanghai have organized the United National Salvation Grand Alliance, which today issues a declaration (see above, omitted). If you agree, please advocate it uniformly, so as to create powerful national public opinion to complete the great cause of national salvation through unification. The nation will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate.

Petition

Petition to the Third Plenary Session: We believe that pacifying the country comes before resisting foreign aggression, and unification is the prerequisite for pacifying the country. Since the resolution of the Guangdong and Guangxi problems, formal unification has been completed, but true unification has not yet been achieved. The occurrence of the Xi'an Incident is sufficient evidence that the country has not yet truly unified. Outside of Xi'an, there is no shortage of signs of feudal separatism, where government orders come from private sources, or military power is equivalent to private property. Local officials are like feudal lords, and when they act on their own impulses, it is the day when internal unrest is brewing. The danger of accumulating firewood under a house is extreme. At this critical time when the national crisis is severe, if we do not quickly seek the unification of government orders and military power, if war cannot be avoided, even if the soldiers at the front have the determination to die, they will not be able to quickly respond to the situation and win victory due to the lack of unification in the rear. Moreover, the outcome of modern warfare depends on the strength of the country's overall power, and the strength of the country's overall power depends on whether its national defense is solid, whether its industry can be mobilized, whether its people are trained, and whether its transportation is convenient and rapid. If each province governs itself, plans related to national defense construction, industrial mobilization, popular training, and military transportation cannot be thoroughly implemented. Moreover, the deployment of troops and the requisition of military supplies cannot be fully in accordance with the wishes of the highest military authorities. Without waiting for the start of the war, the signs of defeat are already visible. We fear that saving the country is merely an elusive hope, while the destruction of the country is an inevitable fact. People from all walks of life in Shanghai, recognizing this, find it difficult to remain silent. Therefore, there is the organization of the United National Salvation Grand Alliance. We all believe that at this time when enemy troops are pressing on the border, we should plan to consolidate the rear and request our central government to assign the National Government to quickly eliminate the remnants of the communist bandits who are causing trouble in the rear, so as to prevent possible disturbances. We should set a deadline to unify the government orders and military power of remote provinces and regions, and not allow the remnants of feudalism who attempt to separate themselves to put on the new disguise of supporting the central government while maintaining their feudal nature. We must strictly punish those who aim to destroy the national united front under the guise of resisting the enemy and saving the country, so that pacifying the country has its actual results and unification is not just an empty name. If adopted, the nation will be fortunate. Speaking frankly, we cannot help but eagerly await orders. Also, in the list of executive committee members of the association published yesterday, due to hasty organization, Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Shao Xubai, Zhang Kebai, Long Peiyun, Ye Xianggao, Gong Yuting, Li Hua, Xu Shushen, Xu Xingchu, Wang Xiaoying, etc. were omitted. This is specially supplemented and recorded.

### The International Radio Station Begins Testing China-Germany Communication

Initial Voice Quality Good

Shenzhou News reports that the Ministry of Communications, in order to develop China's international telecommunications traffic, previously installed wireless telephone equipment when building the Sino-British radio station. After a long period of testing and completion, in addition to Sino-Japanese wireless telephone communication, which was realized in October 1935, and Sino-U.S. testing was also successful, it will soon be opened. The Ministry has recently prepared to carry out China-Germany communication, and has exchanged views with the German Postal Needs Department of the Ministry of Communications, and has obtained the consent of both parties. Both China and Germany have designated the Shanghai International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications and the German State-Owned Wireless Radio Company in Berlin as the test institutions. After receiving the order, the International Radio Station and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications started the China-Germany testing work yesterday. It is reported that the results are good. Once the test is completed, the communication contract and price will be formally negotiated. It is expected that China-Germany communication can be realized in the first half of this year.

### The Income Tax Office Announces a Deadline for Shops to Declare Deposits

Deadline is February 28th; Failure to Report Will Be Considered Concealment

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce held a special committee meeting on income tax yesterday to continue discussing income tax. The details are recorded below.

Declaration of Deposits

The income from securities deposits under the third category of income tax includes (1) interest on deposits received by banks and money shops, (2) interest on loans from money lending businesses, foreign firms, groups, and individuals to companies and shops. Currently, in addition to banks and money shops deducting interest income on deposits starting from January 1st, shops other than money lending businesses that receive deposits will be notified by the Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Office to register the name of the shop, type of business, and office for declaration. It is known that the deadline for this declaration is also February 28th. Failure to report by the deadline will be considered concealment. The interest income on deposits from January 1st of this year should also be subject to income tax deduction and payment in accordance with the general method for money lending businesses.

Answering Questions

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in response to inquiries from the Parasol Industry Association regarding the capital portion of shops, stated the following: (1) If a factory had a capital of tens of thousands of yuan when it was established, but due to the commercial depression over the years, not only has the capital been completely lost, but it is also heavily indebted. However, the manager's credit is quite good, so they can borrow and owe externally for turnover. Therefore, on the surface, there is a turnover of tens of thousands of yuan. In this situation, should income tax be levied based on the capital at the time of investment or based on the operating capital at the end of the 25th year? (2) If a commercial factory had a capital of less than 2,000 yuan when it was established, but has made a profit of tens of thousands of yuan in the past few years, is income tax levied based on the capital amount at the time of establishment or based on the capital at the end of the 25th year? The association immediately transferred the matter to accountant Xu Yongzuo for explanation as follows: Article 7 of the Implementing Rules of the Income Tax stipulates that the commonly referred to as capital is the actual invested principal. Therefore, at the initial establishment, the original investment amount can be used as capital. During continuous operation, the capital amount stated on the capital account can be used as capital (but limited to those that have been reported). (Also, according to the draft rules for collection, public reserve funds that have not been transferred to capital are not counted.) Based on this explanation, in the first example, although the original investment has been virtually lost, if the capital amount has not been transferred out of the account, the monthly average amount on the capital account in the 25th year (non-operating capital, because operating capital is not the capital referred to in the tax law) is used as capital. Borrowing from external creditors for turnover has a separate item for loans or other liabilities, which is not related to capital. Also, in the second example, if the capital at the time of establishment was 2,000 yuan, and there were tens of thousands of yuan in profits several years later, if this tens of thousands of yuan in profits is formally transferred to the capital account after being organized at the end of the 25th year, and the Income Tax Office is notified that the capital amount is tens of thousands of yuan, then starting from the 26th year, the capital amount can be calculated as tens of thousands of yuan.

Special Committee Meeting

The Income Tax Special Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce held its fourth meeting yesterday. Over twenty people, including Zhu Wenqi, Cai Chengxin, Li Quanshi, Xu Yongzuo, Li Wenjie, Wang Zikang, He Yuanming, Pan Xulun, Jiang Wanping, and Xi Yushu, attended. They continued to discuss the draft collection rules and formulated the following revised articles: (1) Under Article 9, it is proposed to add a proviso and a second item as follows: However, due to factual or customary necessity, only the actual amount received may be counted. Those who have calculated their total revenue in accordance with the proviso of the previous item, if they wish to change to using the text of the previous item to calculate their total revenue in a certain year, they should report to the competent collection agency within three months after the beginning of that year. (2) Under Article 10, it is proposed to add a proviso as follows: However, those who calculate their total revenue in accordance with the proviso of the previous item may only include the expenses that have been paid in the actual expenses.

### The Xi'an-Lanzhou Section of the Eurasia Shanghai-Xinjiang Route Will First Open a Special Flight Tomorrow

The Original Schedule Will Be Restored Starting Next Week. The Peiping-Guangzhou and Peiping-Hankou Sections Will Resume Flights First.

According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Xi'an-Lanzhou section of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Xinjiang route will resume flights. A special flight will be opened tomorrow, and the original schedule will be restored next week. It has been decided to resume flights on the Peiping-Guangzhou line in order, with the Peiping-Hankou section resuming first on the 23rd. The details are as follows:

Special Flight for the Xi'an-Lanzhou Section

The Baotou-Lanzhou and Xi'an-Lanzhou sections of the Shanghai-Xinjiang route were suspended due to the Xi'an Incident last year. The company changed the route, diverting the Baotou-Lanzhou section through Peiping, Taiyuan, Baotou, and Ningxia, and the Xi'an-Lanzhou section directly to Chengdu and Kunming via Zhengzhou. After the peaceful resolution of the Xi'an Incident, the company was ordered to resume the original route at the beginning of this month, with a stop at Xi'an. Now, the company has been ordered to resume flights between Xi'an and Lanzhou this week. Due to aircraft allocation, the company decided to open a special flight from Zhengzhou to Lanzhou tomorrow (Thursday) and return from Lanzhou to Zhengzhou on Friday, and restore the original schedule next week to facilitate transportation.

Resumption of the Peiping-Guangzhou Route

The company's Peiping-Guangzhou route opened in May of the 23rd year and was doing well. However, the Changsha and other airports were flooded, preventing planes from landing. At the same time, passenger traffic on other routes was high, and there were not enough planes to allocate, so the route was temporarily suspended by order of the Ministry. However, the company considered the importance of this route for north-south transportation and immediately sought to resume operations after the water receded at the Changsha airport. It has been approved by the Ministry of Transportation to resume the Peiping-Hankou section first, which will run from Peiping through Taiyuan and Zhengzhou to Hankou. It is scheduled to open on the 23rd of this month, with two round trips per week from Peiping to Hankou, departing south on Tuesdays and Fridays and returning north on Thursdays and Sundays. Ticket prices and postage will be the same as before. The resumption of the entire line will be decided after the Peiping-Hankou section resumes and the business is assessed.

### The "London Investment Chronicle" Discusses China's New Policy

Commending Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Minister Kung Hsiang-hsi

According to the Central News Agency, the "London Investment Chronicle" published an article this month entitled "China's New Policies," giving an accurate account of China's financial situation in recent years. The "Shanghai Chinese Daily" reprinted it, but did not disclose the entire article. The full text is translated as follows:

The recent inclusion of completed Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway bonds on the London Stock Exchange is a good omen for those holding Chinese bonds. This event confirms the growing belief that the Chinese government's finances are now guided by a new policy. As is well known, Chinese bonds are divided into three categories: 1) Those with the highest credit, secured by customs revenue, including the 1898 4.5% Anglo-German Loan, the 1925 5% Sino-French Boxer Indemnity Gold Bonds, and the 1913 5% Reorganization Loan. Principal and interest on these bonds have been paid on schedule without interruption. 2) The Salt Gabelle loans secured by the net revenue of the salt tax, including the 1908 4.5% Anglo-French Loan, the 1911 Hukuang Railway Loan, the 1912 Crisp Loan, the 8% Vickers Notes, and the Marconi Notes. The performance of these loans has been less satisfactory. Only the 1908 4.5% Anglo-French Loan has been paid on schedule. The interest on the 1912 Crisp Loan, although paid according to the terms, has been delayed in principal repayment. Now, efforts are being made to double the annual principal repayment to make up for the arrears. The interest on the Vickers Notes and Marconi Notes was suspended after their issuance in 1918-19 and was not resumed until the end of 1936. 3) Railway loans, of which only the 1899 5% Peiping-Shanhaikwan Railway Loan has been paid on schedule. The others have been delayed for varying periods. However, the authorities have now agreed to continue paying a portion of the interest in accordance with the 1936 reorganization plan.

Overall, the above-mentioned loans were all issued in the 19th century, although some were actually issued in the 20th century. A large batch of loans was issued directly for railway construction in the 19th century, and a large portion of the non-railway loans were also used for railway development. In the past, the most reliable loans were guaranteed by foreign administrative agencies within the most reliable government institutions. Even the government itself could not hope to find such guarantees. Now, this principle has been abolished. Therefore, the risks associated with loans in recent years have been greater than usual. Since 1928-29, the Nationalist government established in Nanjing, which advocated nationalism, has seemed to shake the foreign administrative agencies managing customs revenue. The Salt Gabelle Inspectorate has actually been transferred from foreign hands to Chinese control. Before and after the establishment of the Nanjing government, internal disturbances made it impossible to carry out railway reorganization or improvement. At that time, the government was in a period of turmoil and could not care about the future of the loans. It even demanded the abolition of extraterritoriality, which caused unease among those holding Chinese bonds.

Fortunately, the National Government has made bright progress after the initial turbulent period. Today, the generals in North China all obey the central government, and the Guangzhou government, which intended to be independent, no longer exists after the bloodless revolution in September 1936. Therefore, in terms of politics, the Chinese government is now capable of reorganizing its internal affairs, and its financial affairs are also gradually turning from bad to good. The Japanese aggression on the coast and the Communist insurgency in the interior have actually helped to achieve this. It is particularly noteworthy that neither of these threats has weakened the Chinese government's international reputation. Even the strong Japanese aggression in North China seems to have backfired and ended early. The violent militarists in Tokyo are surprised by China's resistance. Japan once believed that it should be responsible for guiding China's economic development. This view now seems to need to be changed. In 1935, Japan demanded that China allow it to occupy a special position in all matters relating to China's external economic relations. When Sir Otto Niemeyer, representing the British Treasury, visited China to investigate China's finances, Japanese newspapers openly expressed hostile remarks. Shortly after, when there was a proposal for a loan, the newspapers arbitrarily criticized it without reservation. On November 5, 1935, the Chinese government resolutely ordered the abandonment of its ancient silver standard and implemented the legal tender (fapi) policy. Japan suspected that this move was the result of a conspiracy between the British Treasury and the United States. Japan's intimidation ultimately failed to stop China's preparations for its domestic development. Last year, China's plan to reorganize long-overdue railway loans gradually restored China's overseas credit. As a result, Chinese railway bonds have the possibility of re-entering the London market. Recently, on January 12, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway bonds issued in Shanghai were included on the London Stock Exchange. This move may be enough to glimpse the people's hearts here. It is expected that new loans will be established one after another. The British Export Credits Guarantee Department's special attention to the Chinese market and the dispatch of representatives to Shanghai are sufficient to indicate that the British government no longer opposes Chinese loans.

From this point of view, investors can now be said to have escaped the panic of the past decade and can believe that the Chinese government is now striving to eliminate the main factors of risk contained in Chinese bonds. The breadth of the Chinese government's jurisdiction today is unmatched by any recent government, so there is no longer any fear of internal disturbances or the interception of customs revenue. The excessive nationalism that once threatened the security of the customs is now no longer a danger because the Chinese government has made it clear that it is willing to keep the customs under foreign management. This move by the Chinese government is indeed a special strength, and the credit it has gained as a result is immense. Furthermore, the Chinese government's resistance to the threats of Japan and the Communists, which is unexpectedly resolute, is also sufficient to enhance its credit.

Today, China's need is to continue the current policy. It is hoped that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will continue to hold the great power of the leader of his government, so that this policy can be guaranteed to continue. However, detailed work still depends on Minister Kung's careful planning to win the trust of the people. This is also an important goal. Minister Kung's painstaking efforts last year to restore the credit of Chinese loans have been praised by the London financial community. Therefore, they all hope that he will continue to manage China's finances. If the development that began in 1936 can continue for several years under the leadership of Minister Kung, then China's growing credit in London will enable China to raise funds in London when it needs to borrow money for its great development. Even today, investors holding a large number of Japanese bonds may be considering whether it would be better to exchange some of them for Chinese bonds.

### The Fishery Syndicate Investigates the Status of Coastal Fisheries in Jiangsu and Zhejiang

Shenjiamen's Annual Fish Catch is Worth 15 Million Yuan. Further Investigations Will Be Conducted Along the Coasts of Fujian, Guangdong, Shandong, and Other Provinces.

The Fishery Loan Syndicate, jointly established by the Ministry of Industry and twelve banks including the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, has set the establishment date on March 1. Its organizational regulations have been passed by the third preparatory meeting and are awaiting approval from the Ministry of Industry. All procedures for the establishment are being handled by the preparatory committee members Qian Xinzhi, Wang Zhixin, and Gui Yanfang in recent days. It is also planned to invite Wu Dingchang, Minister of Industry, to Shanghai to give instructions at that time. The office will still be located at the original site of the preparatory office. It is reported that the 120,000 yuan loan previously granted by the Xinhua and other three banks to the Shanghai Fish Market for re-lending to fresh fish merchants has been repaid by 30,000 yuan. The unpaid amount will be transferred to the syndicate when it is established. As for the syndicate's investigation of the situation in various fishing areas, the investigations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have been completed. In the future, representatives will be sent to Fujian, Guangdong, Shandong, and other provinces for investigation. The fishing conditions of the Zhoushan Islands in Zhejiang are recorded below:

Fishing Conditions

Shenjiamen is located at the eastern end of Zhoushan Island and is a fishing center with more than 3,700 households and more than 16,300 people. Approximately 70% to 80% of the population is engaged in fishing or fishing as a secondary occupation. The island is relatively large, with approximately 600 acres of farmland that can be cultivated with rice, sweet potatoes, and other grains. In addition to local residents and people from this province, there are also people from Fujian and other provinces who go there for fishing. According to estimates by local fish warehouses, the annual fish catch is worth approximately 15 million yuan, with small yellow croaker accounting for the largest share, approximately 35%. Ribbonfish is the second largest, approximately 25%, followed by large yellow croaker, cuttlefish, crabs, eels, etc. The fishermen's income is sold by the fish warehouses, either processed or transported to other places by iced vessels. Most of them are sold to various ports in this province, accounting for approximately 40% of the total. Sales to Jiangsu and Shanghai account for 28%, Guangdong accounts for 20%, Fujian accounts for 10%, and other regions account for 2%.

Fishermen's Lives

The fishing boats in this area are all old-fashioned, and the large pair trawlers for catching small yellow croaker are the main tools, numbering 800 pairs. There are 1,170 large trawlers for catching large yellow croaker, 1,800 red-head trawlers, 1,280 drift nets, 200 seine nets, and 580 fishing boats. The fishermen go out to sea every year from the Mid-Autumn Festival, catching small yellow croaker from Liuheng Island and Taohua Island to the north. During the Minor Snow solar term, they go to the Shengsi Islands to catch hairtail. By the Winter Solstice, they return to the vicinity of Shenjiamen to catch pomfret. From the Qingming Festival to the Beginning of Summer, they catch small yellow croaker in Shengsi. From the Beginning of Summer to Taishan and Changtu, they catch large yellow croaker. In June and July, they mostly stop working to repair boats and nets. Therefore, their lives are very hard, and some people work all year round without getting enough to eat.

Welcome Loans

The fishermen's economic situation is extremely difficult. Therefore, each time they go out to sea, they rely on the assistance of the fish warehouses, and the fish warehouses rely on the banks and native banks. Before the Bank of China had an office there, it lent approximately 50,000 yuan in the 23rd year. The Ningbo native banks lent a large amount of money. However, since the financial turmoil occurred in Ningbo in the 24th year, 7.2 million yuan was withdrawn at once, and the Bank of China also stopped lending. Fortunately, the fish warehouses had sufficient capital, so the fishing industry was not affected. However, their conditions for fishermen are very harsh. After the fishermen borrow money, the fish they catch must be sold by the fish warehouses, which charge a commission of 5%. As for the interest rate, it is 25 yuan per hundred yuan for long-term loans and 2% per month for short-term loans. Therefore, the fishermen were very happy to learn that the syndicate would provide loans at low interest rates. There is a fishery production cooperative in this area with only 20 members engaged in freshwater fish farming. However, the capital is insufficient, and the results are not good.

### The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xiamen-Philippines Route Will Open Next Month

The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's designation of the "Haiheng" vessel to operate the Xiamen-Philippines route has been reported repeatedly in newspapers. However, the news of a postponement of the opening of the route was reported in various newspapers yesterday. After inquiring with the company, the information was confirmed. It is said that since this is the first time a foreign route is being opened, every effort must be made to improve all the equipment on the ship. Furthermore, in order to ensure that the overseas Chinese in the Philippines are widely aware of the route, it is necessary to make extensive announcements in advance. Currently, these procedures have not been fully completed. Taking advantage of this preparation time, the "Haiheng" vessel will be temporarily ordered to sail to Hong Kong and Guangzhou. Once everything is ready, the opening of the route will be scheduled, and it is expected to be next month. The vessel is new and does not need to be repaired. The rumors that the postponement of the opening of the route is due to business reasons are not true.

### Xue Xiangyun is Willing to Go to Zhenru for Examination to Determine if She Has Ever Had Children

The Case Was Originally Submitted with Anonymous Letters from Both Parties. The Judge Forbade Public Attendance Because the Case Concerned Public Morality.

Xu Liangchen, a real estate merchant residing at No. 2, Lane 106, Maitehesi Tuo Road, previously married Xue Xiangyun, the daughter of the dye merchant Xue Baorun, and they have been married for more than ten years. Recently, Wang Yongquan, a former chauffeur of the Xue family, requested the First Special Court's Civil Division to confirm that his son, Wang Genbao, was Xue Xiangyun's biological son. After the trial, the court ruled against Wang Yongquan. Now, Xu and Xue (i.e., Xiangyun) have hired lawyers Ossen and Tang Shenpei to accuse Wang Yongquan and Wang Genbao of libel, perjury, and fraud. After a preliminary hearing, Xu and Xue voluntarily requested a forensic examination by Dr. Wei Ligong to prove that she had never had children. However, the court, in order to demonstrate fairness and comply with the ministry's order that a woman's body should be examined by a female forensic doctor, ordered Xu and Xue to go to the court on the morning of the 14th of this month and submit a document to the female forensic doctor of the Shanghai Local Court for examination. This has been reported in this newspaper. However, the date was changed, and Xu and Xue did not go to the court, so the examination has not been carried out yet. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30, Judge Zhong Qing of the Second Criminal Division of the court continued the hearing of the case. Many people were present in the courtroom. First, Judge Zhong questioned Xu and Xue as to why they did not go to the court for examination. According to Xu, although she could be examined by a female forensic doctor of the Local Court, she was still afraid of being attacked by others, so she voluntarily requested to go to the Zhenru Forensic Research Institute established by the Ministry of Justice for examination. Chen Wen, the defendant's lawyer, immediately argued that the previous court order required the plaintiff to go to the female forensic doctor's office of the Local Court for examination. If the plaintiff did not agree with the ruling, she could appeal according to the law. Now, the plaintiff not only did not go for the examination but also requested another examination, which was a sign of contempt for the law and resistance to the court order. Judge Zhong ruled that since the plaintiff voluntarily requested to go to the Forensic Research Institute for examination, it was legally permissible. Then, the plaintiff's lawyer presented an anonymous letter, saying that it was received after the previous adjournment of the case. The defendant's lawyer also presented an anonymous letter, saying that the adjournment of the case was requested because the defendant's side was currently collecting evidence. The evidence is now in Hankou, and it takes time to travel back and forth. Even if the evidence cannot prove that Xu and Xue are Wang Genbao's biological mother, it can at least prove the relationship between Xu and Xue and Wang Yongquan. After reviewing the letters presented by both parties, the court was shocked and angered. Because the case concerned public morality, it declared that public attendance was prohibited. Therefore, the content of the interrogation could not be known. As a result, the case was adjourned for questioning.

### Xu Qizhong's Romantic Bankruptcy Ends

Bankrupt Property Distributed According to the Mediation Plan. Creditors Have Already Collected Their Payments.

The Xu Qizhong romantic bankruptcy case, which caused a sensation, was only resolved after the third creditors' meeting convened by the First Special Court passed the mediation plan and reached a settlement. Subsequently, the court issued a public notice. Because no creditors raised objections during the notice period, the court specially ordered the bankruptcy administrator, accountant Wang Sifang, to distribute the funds according to the mediation plan as soon as possible to close the case. The original order of the First Special Court is recorded below: Order No. 13637 orders Xu Qizhong's bankruptcy administrator, accountant Yu Sifang, to submit a document on October 1, 25, to submit the distribution list for Xu Qizhong's bankruptcy case and to ask for verification and compliance. The document and three copies of the distribution list, and one copy of the revised creditor list, are all accepted and duly announced in accordance with the law. No creditors have raised objections during the notice period. You are hereby ordered to distribute the funds according to the list and report for verification. This order is from President Guo Yunguan. After receiving the order, accountant Wang immediately complied with the order and transported all the bankrupt property together with the bankrupt to fulfill the mediation plan, and delivered the cash and stocks, etc., distributed the funds according to the list, and sent notices to the creditors, ordering them to bring their seals and go to collect the payments. After receiving the notices, the creditors, such as Sincere, Hengxiang, and Ying Huizhen, the female owner of the Wendi brothel, have already collected their payments. As of recently, only Wang Bingzhong, Fuyuan Native Bank, Wang Yuanchen, and Dongxinglou Restaurant are left. The payments that these households should receive have now been transferred to the court for collection. At this point, the case has come to a complete end, and the bankruptcy administrator has reported to the court.

### The Perpetrators of Throwing Stolen Goods and Making False Accusations Are Sentenced

Li Xiaoshi, the former leader of the Ximen squad of the Investigation Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and investigators Jin Yushan and squad leader Lü Jinchun, colluded with bandits to rob the police of their handguns and then threw the stolen goods to frame innocent people. The former leader of the First Squad, Liang Yu, captured the bandits Xu Xueqin and others. Li Xiaoshi and Jin Yushan fled their posts in fear of punishment. Lü Jinchun and his accomplices Yang Futang, Xin Kun, and Xin Dahuzi were arrested and transferred to the Local Court. After interrogation by Judge Wu Xiangzu, it was announced yesterday that Lü Jinchun was sentenced to five years of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of civil rights for jointly abusing the power of public officials and falsely accusing the public officials in charge with the intention of causing others to be criminally punished. Yang Futang was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for possessing military firearms and ammunition with the intention of providing them for others to commit crimes. Xin Kun and Xin Dahuzi were each sentenced to nine months of imprisonment for harboring criminals.

### Zhongshan Hospital is Scheduled to Open

The Zhongshan Hospital, built by the Shanghai Medical Affairs Committee in Fenglin Bridge, has been completely completed. It is large in scale and fully equipped. It is reported that the hospital has already begun to diagnose patients and is scheduled to hold an opening ceremony on April 1. At that time, the National Medical Association will hold its annual meeting in the hospital.

### Secret Plot to Assassinate Government Official Gong Chunpu Recants

The Police Charge Him with Conspiracy to Murder, Gong Denies Involvement, Court Hearing Adjourned for Further Investigation

Since the September 18th Incident, the League of Nations dispatched a fact-finding mission led by Lord Lytton to China.  Upon arrival in Shanghai, they resided at the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road. At that time, Wang Yaqiao and other leaders of an assassination group plotted to murder important government officials. They rented room 511 at the

Cathay Hotel and possessed three hand grenades, two pistols, and thirty-nine bullets. However, they failed to find a suitable opportunity to carry out their plan. Subsequently, the Public Concession Police successively arrested twenty-three individuals involved in the case, including Long Lin. Long Lin, Tang Ming, and others provided detailed confessions about the matter, implicating Long Chunpu, also known as Duanpu, a native of Xiangyin, Hunan, as a key member of Wang Yaqiao's group in charge of finances. After Long and the others were taken away by the inland

officials, the Xinzha Police arrested Zhang Quncheng (also known as Peng Guoyao) and Li Sude (also known as Hu Ruian), who also confessed to being involved in the plot. Zhang and Li were later sentenced to twenty years imprisonment by the First Special District Court and handed over to the inland authorities. Recently, Lao Zha Police Detective Pang Ruiqing and Li Shugui discovered that Xi had arrived in Shanghai. Consequently, they arrested Gong at 978 Baker Road and sent him to the First Special District Court, which ordered a postponement of the hearing. Yesterday morning, Qian Hongye, the criminal division chief of the First Special District Court,

presided over a continued hearing in the First Criminal Court. Ru Bao-yi, the lawyer representing the police, stated that based on previous confessions, the defendant Gong Chunpu was involved in the plot to assassinate government officials. Therefore, he was charged with preparing to commit robbery and endangering public safety under Article 27, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code. However, the crime occurred between March 20th and 23rd, 1932. At that time, the Criminal Code did not have provisions for the crime of preparing to commit murder. Therefore, the court should decide whether the current charges are appropriate.  Gong Chunpu testified that in 1931, while living at No. 62 Jianye Lane on Route Ghisi,

his distant cousin, Gong Xianglin, introduced him to Long Lin. Later, Long borrowed 500 yuan from him, which he refused. He did not know Zhang Yucheng or Li Sude well. When the court asked if Tang Ming had ever lived in his house, he replied that he had not.  The court asked him about his confession to the police that Chen Ming-shu had instructed Wang Yaqiao to use fake bombs to create fear and express public dissatisfaction. Gong replied that this was a misunderstanding by the police. He only mentioned that Chen's secretary had told him about it, not that he knew about it because he participated in the plot. The court adjourned the hearing for one week to retrieve the case files.

### Embezzling a Large Sum of Money from the Shop and Falsely Reporting a Robbery

Tying His Hands and Slashing His Face to Pretend He Was Robbed, Detectives Reveal the Truth, Sentencing Scheduled

Yang Xiaodi, a 52-year-old native of Suzhou residing at No. 7 Liuzhi Lane, Tanziawan, Zhabei, had been working as a shop clerk at the Fuxin Flour Mill on West Suzhou Road for over twenty years. On the afternoon of the 8th of this month, at 3:30 PM, the factory needed to issue wages and instructed Yang to go to the head office on Jiangxi Road to collect 4,000 yuan in legal tender from the Zhongnan Bank.  Unexpectedly, Yang reported a robbery to the Xinzha Police. After investigation by detectives Wu Changkai and Ding Huaguo, it was discovered that Yang had

falsely reported the robbery. Yang was detained and sent to the First Special District Court, with a request for detention. This was already reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Shan Chuanlin continued the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, filed a public prosecution based on Article 169 of the Criminal Code for false accusation and Article 336, Paragraph 1 for embezzlement of business assets. He also recounted the investigation process, stating that during the adjournment, the defendant firmly denied and refused to reveal the truth at the police station. After investigation, the detectives confirmed that it was a false report and found a bicycle. It was discovered that the defendant

knew a barber, Sanliuzi, in Tanziawan. Two months ago, the defendant borrowed 20 yuan from Sanliuzi. Sanliuzi also knew that the defendant was a shop clerk at the Fuxin Factory and often went to collect money. They jointly planned to have Yang notify Sanliuzi when he was going to withdraw money. Therefore, the defendant notified Sanliuzi this time, who gathered his accomplices Yi Jingen and Changjiao. They met in room 217 of the Tianran Hotel on Zhifu Road. After getting the money, the four of them would divide it equally. On that day, Yang Xiaodi

collected 4,000 yuan in legal tender and rode his bicycle directly to the Tianran Hotel. He handed over all the money to Xuan Jingen. Then, he went with Sanliuzi, Changjiao, and others to Shanchang Lane on Carter Road. They abandoned the bicycle in the alley and then hired a Xiang Sheng taxi by phone. They drove to the opposite side of the Zhaofeng Garden and got out of the car. They went to a deserted field, where they tied Yang's hands with rope, and Changjiao slashed Yang's face to avoid suspicion. Yang then pretended to be robbed and cried for help. A rickshaw puller passed by and took him to the police station to report the incident. Furthermore, witness

Zhang Genyang, a driver from Xiang Sheng Taxi Company, and Wu Jinchang, a bookkeeper from Fuxin Factory, proved the incident.

### Outcome of the Third Appeal in the Li Jinxiang Kidnapping Case

Only Chen A'er Gets a Retrial, Fang Dalang's Appeal Rejected, Dies from Severe Illness

Li Jinxiang, the only son of Li Guanlin, a resident of Li's Family Village, Remy Road in the French Concession, was six years old this year.  On the evening of May 13, 1935, at around 7:00 PM, kidnappers suddenly knocked on the door, falsely claiming to be asking Li Guanlin to treat a child's illness for his elderly daughter.  They entered the house, abducted Jinxiang, and hid him, demanding 50,000 yuan for his release.  The case was reported to the French police, who investigated and solved it after about a month.  The kidnappers Zhao Tao-tao, Dong A-qing, Dong A-qing, Chen Jinsheng, Wang Jinxiang, Yang Shaobai, Fang Dalang, Su Zhaogen, Yang Hongde, and suspects Xu Weiming, Ji Xiucheng, Jin Heshang, Ding A-liu, and others, twelve in total, were arrested.

It was also discovered that Chen A'er, also known as Chen Rongxiang, a tailor from Pudong and Li Guanlin's brother-in-law, was the mastermind.  He posed as the victim's representative to negotiate the ransom with the kidnappers to pass on information. Therefore, Chen was also arrested.  After rescuing the kidnapped Li Jinxiang from Jiangxinsha in Pudong, the prisoners were sent to the Second Special District Court, where the French Concession Prosecutor's Office filed charges in accordance with the law.  The result of the trial was that Chen A'er was sentenced to 15 years, Dong A-qing to 12 years, Zhao Tao-tao, Wang Jinxiang, and Fang Dalang to 10 years each, Chen Jinsheng and Yang Shaobai to 7 years each, and Yang Hongde

to 5 years, and Su Zhaogen to 1 year. Xu Weiming, Ji Xiucheng, Jin Heshang, and Ding A-liu were acquitted. Of these sentences, only Hongde and Su Zhaogen did not appeal and were executed. The remaining individuals appealed to the High Court Third Branch. The result was that the original sentences for Zhao Tao-tao and Chen Jinsheng were upheld, and the remaining sentences were changed. Wang Jinxiang and Yang Shaobai were acquitted, Chen A'er and Dong A-qing each had their sentences reduced to 10 years, and Fang Dalang had his sentence reduced to 8 years. However, Zhao Tao-tao, Chen A'er, Fang Dalang, and Dong A-qing were still

dissatisfied with the judgment and filed a second appeal with the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court reviewed the entire case file and determined that the evidence for the crimes of Zhao Tao-tao, Fang Dalang, and Dong A-qing was sufficient and rejected their appeals.  The original judgment against Chen A'er was overturned because the court believed that Chen was related to the victim and went to inquire after the incident. The victim requested that Chen represent him in negotiations with the kidnappers. Aside from the confessions of the criminals Zhao Tao-tao, Fang Dalang, Yang Hongde, etc., there was no

affirmative proof. The original trial did not conduct a detailed investigation, and the facts were not clear. Therefore, the case was remanded to the High Court Third Branch for a retrial. After receiving the case file, the High Court Third Branch held an investigative hearing yesterday, presided over by Judge Chen Daqi.  The appellant Chen A'er and co-defendant Zhao Tao-tao were brought to court, and the victims Li Guanlin and his wife and the investigating detectives Zhong Benchang and Dai Rongji were

summoned to court for investigation and questioning. Chen categorically denied participating in the kidnapping, claiming to have been falsely accused. He hired lawyer Yao Yunbo to defend him. The court adjourned the hearing for a later date. Chen was returned to the detention center, and Zhao was sent back to prison. Fang Dalang, a criminal who also filed a third appeal, was seriously ill in prison. After receiving the judgment rejecting his third appeal, he was shocked, and his condition worsened. He died on the morning of the 15th. The prison reported the death to the court for verification and notified his family to collect the body.

### Hongchang Pawnshop Accused of Embezzlement

Ring Not Yet Due, Already Forfeited Upon Redemption Attempt

Wu Yunfu, a native of Nantong residing at No. 6 Tongfu Lane, Jufuda Road in the French Concession, borrowed a diamond ring worth 2,270 yuan from the wife of Fan Liangbo on December 14, 1935, due to urgent financial need. He pawned it for 500 yuan at the Hongchang Pawnshop, No. 1 Hong Deli, at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Julai Road. At that time, the term was set at twelve months. When the term expired, he went to redeem it, but the pawnshop had already forfeited it according to the regulations printed on the pawn ticket that

the term was eight months. Wu claimed that the pawn ticket was stamped with a twelve-month expiration date. The pawnshop was trying to swallow and embezzle the ring. He first reported it to the French police, but it could not be resolved. Wu Yunfu then hired lawyer Ge Zhitan to file a complaint with the Second Special District Court, accusing Chen Yaoming, a Chaozhou native, shareholder and manager of the Hongchang Pawnshop, of embezzlement. He also filed a civil lawsuit to recover the original item, etc. Judge Chen Shuo-ying held a hearing. These facts have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, they were summoned again, and both parties came to court with their lawyers. The plaintiff

presented several pawn tickets that he had pawned to the defendant's shop from relatives and friends as evidence. The pawn tickets were stamped with a rectangular stamp indicating one year (i.e., twelve months). He claimed that he urgently needed money at the time and had his wife borrow the ring from Mrs. Fanbo of Jumin Lane. When it was time to redeem it, he had no money to redeem it because the Fan family was pressing him. He handed the pawn ticket to the Fan family, who transferred it to a jewelry broker to sell the ring. When he went to redeem it, it had already been forfeited by the defendant's shop. He requested attention to the twelve-month stamp on the pawn ticket.  The defendant, Chen Yaoming, stated that in 1935, the shop only had stamps for six months and eighteen months, but not for thirteen months. If a customer wanted to extend the term to twelve months, it would be written on the pawn ticket and stamped with a perforation stamp as proof. It was not until 1936 that a twelve-month stamp was used. The court reviewed the testimony and determined that further investigation was necessary, and adjourned the hearing for a later date.

Reported Findings to the Ministry of Finance by Telegraph

According to the Xin Xin News Agency, Zheng Baozhao, Director of the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, traveled from Shanghai in the middle of last month to Anhui Province, followed by Hubei and Hunan, to conduct on-site investigations to effectively regulate the surplus and deficit of grain in various parts of the country.

### Oxford Group Holds Spiritual Retreat

Aimed at Transforming Lives

The Oxford Group held a four-day spiritual retreat at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road during the Lunar New Year. About 70 men and women from various countries attended, including government officials, faculty and students from five universities, Chinese and foreign doctors and pastors, Chinese and foreign journalists, and representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors.

The Oxford Group in this city holds weekly meetings in the West District, North District, Central District, and South Gate, respectively. Saint John's University, Fudan University, the National Medical College, Soochow University, the American School, and the Western Children's Public School of the Municipal Council all have its presence.

Other by-products, such as millet, sorghum, potatoes, etc., are also a major source of food for the people, but due to the scorching sun, many were not planted, and when the rice was about to ripen, it was hit by floods. All those bordering the four major river basins of Minjiang, Tuojiang, Jialing, and Gouzi were turned into swamps, and fields and huts were washed away. As a result, the average harvest was only 30-40%. The people's livelihood was already difficult, but unexpectedly, since winter, the drought has struck again. There has been no rain for several months, and soybeans and wheat have not been harvested. Grass roots and tree bark have been dug up and eaten. Even well springs have dried up, and water must be fetched from several or dozens of miles away. Within a year, three strange disasters have occurred.

### Wang Hanqing Could Not Be Arrested, Ye Fukan's Trial Continued Yesterday

After the public prosecution of lawyer Ye Fukan for embezzlement, the victim Wang Hanqing suddenly submitted a statement to withdraw the case, and he himself evaded appearing. Therefore, the court instructed the Hankou Local Court to arrest him, but it was unsuccessful. Therefore, Judge Lu continued the trial yesterday and first explained to Ye that Wang Hanqing could not be arrested and that there was no need to arrest him again. Then he continued to ask Ye when Wang Hanqing's family, Wang Zhang, etc., returned to Henan. Ye replied, "Around August of the 21st year. I remember that at that time, lawyer Cha Renwei sent a letter instructing me to liquidate the accounts." The judge asked, "In whose name were the funds from the Zhongnan Bank deposited?" Ye replied, "I can't remember." The judge asked, "Who took them?" Ye replied, "I can't remember either." The judge asked, "Who took the deposits from the Juyu Cheng Bank? Didn't Wang Zhang live in your house?" Ye replied, "How could a special person live in my house?" The judge asked, "You found a Zhejiang Xingye Bank deposit slip for 3,000 yuan in Wang Hanqing's box. It was from the head office at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Beijing Road." Ye replied, "I never went to his house at all." The judge asked, "You took the three-yuan deposit slip from the Zhejiang Xingye Branch in Hongkou." Ye replied, "The slip was sent by lawyer Fan Gang, and I gave it to Wang Zhang to take it. After taking it out, it was used for public expenses." At this point, the court adjourned the hearing to another date.

### Gen Tai Factory Sues to Confirm Lease Rights of Sealed Property

Hu Yangsu, legal representative of the China Gen Tai Yiji Hehe Flour Factory, hired lawyer Li Lin to sue Guohua Bank and Chen Zhuqing, etc., in the local court to confirm that the sealed property has lease rights and should not be moved after the auction. The petition stated that the plaintiff leased the factory premises and buildings of the China Gen Tai Hehe Flour Factory, including the entire business trademark and trade name, from Cheng Linsheng, the factory owner, on March 25, 1935, for a period of 20 years, paying an annual rent of 4,000 yuan. Lawyer Li Shirui, who has passed away, certified the lease agreement. After the lease, the defendants, etc., held creditor's rights against the lessor China Gen Tai Factory and Cheng Linsheng, that is, Guohua Bank and Chen Zhuqing, and successively sealed the above-mentioned assets among the leased properties. Recently, they have also been carrying out valuation and auction procedures. The plaintiff has been using the sealed assets for a long time to operate the factory. The livelihoods of more than 70 workers in the former China Gen Tai Factory depend on this. Moreover, the seal record of the defendant Guohua Bank on April 12, 1935, not only detailed the plaintiff's name but also noted the current tenant, etc. The defendant Chen Zhuqing's seal was also the same. Therefore, according to the provisions of Article 425 of the Civil Code, no matter who the ownership of the sealed property is transferred to due to the auction, the lease right should continue to exist and cannot be moved away from the factory due to the auction. Otherwise, the livelihoods of all the factory workers will be cut off as a result. Therefore, it is requested that the court confirm that the plaintiff has lease rights to the various assets of the China Gen Tai Hehe Flour Factory sealed by the defendants, that they should not be moved after the auction, and that they should be marked in the auction announcement, etc. Judge Wang Yijun held a court session yesterday. The defendants hired lawyers Yuan Xingyuan and Wang Xintang, etc., claiming that the litigants were not qualified because the defendants were not the new owners and had no relationship with the plaintiff. This lawsuit can only be filed against the new owners after the auction. The questioner asked that the litigation fees have not yet been fully paid and will be re-tried after a separate order is issued to pay the balance.

### Daylight Robbery of Rice Funds on Gonghe New Road

1,316 Yuan

Robbery cases have occurred frequently in Zhabei recently. Yesterday afternoon at about 3 pm, Zhang Zhichu, the manager of Rencheng Rice Shop at No. 390 Gonghe New Road, Yongyu Road Intersection, reported that at about 12:20 pm on the 10th of this month, Huang Baolin, the shop's accountant, hired a rickshaw to deliver funds to various rice shops on Xinzha Bridge and Guangfu Road, carrying three packages of legal tender, one package of 580 yuan to Juyu Cheng Rice Shop, one package of 205 yuan to Yongshun Tai Rice Shop, and one package of 531 yuan to Tong Shen Rice Shop, all wrapped in newspapers and hidden in his pocket.

According to statistics, the value of cod liver oil imported from Norway in 1936 was over 85,000 yuan in national currency, but in 1937, it suddenly increased to over 210,000 yuan.

### Letter

Sir, I am writing on behalf of my client, Gu Shaoqin, who was shocked to read the news item "Woman Dies from Abortion, Husband Sues for Damages" in the Shen Bao on the 16th of this month. I have learned that my client is studying nursing at Dasheng Hospital, and unfortunately, like Dr. Yan, has been implicated in the case. Whether she is guilty or innocent should be determined by the law, and I do not wish to argue about it. However, the newspaper stated that the defendant's side had already hired someone to negotiate with the victim's family to compensate for the losses, in order to mitigate criminal responsibility. This is absolutely untrue. I suspect that someone deliberately stirred up public opinion in order to slander the newspaper and the news is inaccurate. I ask you, the respected newspaper, to investigate and correct the situation. Respectfully submitted to the Shen Bao, Lawyer Sun Zuji, Du Xi, February 16th.

### Du Yuesheng and Others' Letter to the Creditors of Tongyi

Dear Sirs, Half a year has passed since the closure of Tongyi Trust Company. During this time, there have been bankruptcy rulings, litigation disputes, the hasty efforts of debt collection groups, and repeated fruitless meetings of creditors, causing much turmoil and exhaustion among those involved, with no tangible results. Apart from the return of one-quarter of the savings department debts, nothing else has been heard. We have served in Shanghai for many years and have many relatives and friends involved in the Tongyi debt situation. Moreover, the total amount of debt is as high as more than 4 million yuan, which has a considerable impact on Shanghai's financial situation. Out of public duty and private sentiment, we cannot stand idly by. Therefore, with the consultation of creditors and their representatives, we advocated for speedy mediation and resumption of business as soon as possible, so that debts could be repaid sooner and creditors could benefit more. We have proposed a plan and personally guarantee it. At that time, we consulted widely, considered the pros and cons, and put in a lot of effort. Now, we will briefly state the advantages and disadvantages for discussion.

Generally speaking, the amount of debt recovery should be maximized, and the speed of recovery should be expedited. More is better, less is harmful; speed is beneficial, delay is harmful. This is an unchanging principle. From the beginning, we have advocated for speedy mediation and resumption of business as soon as possible, because we believe that only in this way can the amount be maximized and the recovery be expedited. It is easy to understand that this principle does not require further explanation. First, let's talk about the speed of recovery. According to the mediation plan, the repayment method, and Article 5 of the plan, the repayment period will be calculated from the date of the mediation agreement, which is approximately six to nine months, and no later than one year. According to the bankruptcy procedure, the repayment period will be at least three to four years later. Because in the bankruptcy procedure, the disposal of assets must first be converted into cash. Converting to cash requires an auction, which requires an announcement, which requires an assessment of the price, which requires the consent of the supervisor. The procedures are very complicated. After the auction, if there is no buyer, the price must be reduced and the announcement must be re-issued for another auction. The procedures are very complicated again. This is done once or twice, and so on countless times. This is the case for one asset, and so on for all assets. The time required for this is undoubtedly far away. As for the recovery of accounts, the procedures are as complicated as the disposal of assets. After some twists and turns, a lawsuit is filed, and after some litigation, a judgment is made and executed. The execution may be challenged, and the objection must be litigated again. Fortunately, the execution must go through some twists and turns before the auction. If the execution is unsuccessful, it must be pursued for some time. This is the case for household A, and perhaps also for household B. The time required for this is undoubtedly far away. How long is life? The changes in the world are infinite. Judging from previous examples, it is often a waste of time with no results. Even if it proceeds smoothly and ends safely, the creditor will be in an extremely disadvantageous position. Compared with the mediation plan and repayment method, which is no more than one year, the advantages and disadvantages cannot be compared on the same day. (To be continued)

### Third Day of Sino-British Billiards Match: Ding Mingyi vs. Booker

Yesterday, Wu Chengqi Lost to Chestham - Result: 600 to 469 Points

In the Sino-British billiards match, Shen Lince won by 86 points the day before yesterday. Yesterday, Wu Chengqi lost by 131 points. Today, on the third day, the third group, Ding Mingyi, will face Booker. It will be held at the association at 5:30 PM. Ding has superb skills, while Booker is also one of the top players among the British expatriates. The determination of around 600 points will surely be a tense competition.

Yesterday, Chestham of the British fourth group showed his strong combat strength as the best player among the five players in the British team. The team had this strategy of five changes in front and back positions to balance the overall situation. Before the game yesterday, Wu Chengqi's defeat was expected, but it was hoped that the losses would not be too great, affecting future victories. Sure enough, Wu did his best to keep up, and within 600 points, he even exceeded it several times. In the end, he lost by only 131 points. The cumulative score for the two days is a loss of 45 points, which has little impact on the championship prospects. Chestham had 14 shots that exceeded 20 points, while Wu had only 5. However, the largest shot of 50 points that day was made by Wu. Chestham took the lead at first, but Wu gradually rose with his non-empty shots, initially exceeding 300 points. Chestham suddenly used smooth techniques, hitting four large scores in a row: 38, 36, 38, 25, etc., leading by 163 points (566 to 403). Fortunately, he did not relax afterwards and continued to fight seriously, winning back more than 30 points. The result was 600 to 469 points. The highest records of the two are as follows:

Chestham: 21, 46, 21, 29, 25, 24, 21, 23, 30, 28, 38, 36, 38, 25.

Wu Chengqi: 10, 50, 30, 5, 35.

### Shanghai Chinese United Team Defeats Hankou Again in the Leader Cup Inter-City Replay

Hankou Scores First, Resulting in 2-1

The Leader Cup Hong Kong-Hankou-Shanghai Simple Football Inter-City Match has attracted the attention of many fans since the first round was held on the 14th. Therefore, yesterday's replay between Hankou and the Shanghai Chinese United team was even more crowded. As a result of the battle, the Shanghai team won 2-1. At the sound of the bell, the Hankou team took the field first, and the Shanghai Chinese United team arrived late. After tossing a coin to determine the formation, the fierce battle began. On the Shanghai side, Mai Jiliang was stationed in the center, with strict medical skills. On the Hankou side, Deng Zhiyang was moving East and West, with no gap to be found. The two teams were evenly matched for more than ten minutes. Before long, Hankou's Zheng Zhiyun got the ball and passed it remotely to Wu Qixiang. Wu did not sit on the landing ball and swept it with force, slightly off target. Then, Huang Hongrong on the left and Luo Cheng on the right were on the attack, and Deng Zhiyang responded on the right corner. With a bang, the record was opened first. The Shanghai generals refused to show weakness, running and jumping as fast as gods. The Hankou position was suddenly tight. Shu Shigeng received assistance from Cao Qinfang and shot quickly, hitting the net. The first half ended with a 1-1 draw. In the second half, the Shanghai formation was slightly changed. Jin Jiabiao was replaced by Lu Zhiming. Jin was well-defended, and the Hankou three forwards could not attack. They changed to attacking from the left. Huang Guorong was agile and lively, feinting attacks. The burly man Li Yichen could not stop him either. Several shots were dangerously close, but fortunately Lu Chengkang was agile and defused the danger one by one. Seeing the situation was not good, Jia Liliang of the Shanghai team worked hard to counterattack. Sure enough, the situation turned better. There were many dangerous situations in front of the Hankou team. Cao Qinfang got the ball and swept it sideways, and the ball went into the net from the corner of the goal. At this time, the Hankou team was determined to recover the lost ground, but unfortunately time was against them, and they suffered a miserable defeat with a score of 1-2. In this battle, the main player of the Hankou team, Zheng Zhiyun, suffered a serious leg injury due to careless ball saving. Therefore, although the Hankou team has already left Shanghai, Zheng is still waiting for treatment, and the National Small Football Association has sent a letter to the Wuchang Provincial Capital Police Department to ask for leave. The lineup is recorded as follows:

### Elementary Schools Should Pay Attention to Implementing Health Education

The Municipal Social Bureau Issues an Order to Comply With

The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau instructs public and private elementary schools: Health education is crucial to the physical and mental development of children. Improper implementation can affect children's physique, which is not a minor issue. Implementation methods should be carefully studied to ensure they are physiologically appropriate and coupled with corresponding measures to gradually achieve perfection. Ten special precautions for implementing health education are hereby formulated and urgently distributed for all schools to comply with. The attached precautions are as follows: 1. Except for natural deep breathing during exercise, students should not be required to perform deep breathing exercises. 2. Instruct students to drink boiled water when they are thirsty and do not require them to drink a certain number of cups per day. 3. When students are sweeping, they should be equipped with long-handled brooms and wear mouth covers. 4. In classrooms with insufficient light, the seating arrangements of students should be swapped every week according to height, with brighter and darker seats being exchanged. 5. Students should not be punished to stand for more than 10 minutes. 6. There should be a lively and happy atmosphere between teachers and students in the classroom. 7. Teachers should not sit or stand in front of windows during teaching, exposing students directly to the light. 8. When students are working at their desks, they should bend their arms and keep their backs straight. 9. Students are prohibited from working under direct sunlight. 10. Students are prohibited from putting pencils in their mouths.

### The Ministry Orders a Reduction in Book Prices

(Nanjing, 16th) The Ministry of Education believes that the prices of textbooks and books published by various bookstores are not reasonable. It has instructed the Shanghai Education Bureau to transfer the order to the Shanghai Book Industry Association to formulate a unified sales method for textbooks and books, which has been submitted to the Ministry for modification and issuance for compliance. Subsequently, various bookstores submitted the reduction of prices of primary and secondary school textbooks to the Ministry for record. The Ministry approved the trial implementation for six months, after which all prices should be revised again. The principle is that the price of secondary school textbooks should be reduced to 90% of the original price, and the price of primary school textbooks should be reduced to 50% of the original price. The prices of ordinary books should also be reduced appropriately. Now, the Ministry of Education believes that the New Year period is coming to an end, and various bookstores should immediately revise and reduce prices again. In addition, some bookstores have not fully implemented the price reduction of ordinary books and have instead set the original price as the actual price, which is not appropriate. On the 16th, it was specifically ordered that the Social Bureaus of Shanghai and Beijing should transfer the order to various bookstores to quickly reduce prices and submit a comparative table for review and approval.

### Ministry of Education Assesses Subsidies for Vocational Schools

(Nanjing Dispatch, 16th) The Ministry of Education, concerned with whether the subsidies for vocational schools in various provinces and cities are being used according to the approved budget, especially since more than half of the funds have already been allocated, has decided to conduct separate assessments.

National Products Special

### A Word on Supporting National Products During the Lunar New Year

— Yang An

Customs occupy a significant place in Chinese society, and as we celebrate the Lunar New Year, we deeply feel their deeply rooted nature. Any force would find it difficult to change them in a short time. As we observe the path of national products during this Lunar New Year, it is worth discussing.

First, Daily Necessities　When people celebrate the New Year, they inevitably buy some daily necessities. According to the report of the China National Products Company, daily necessities account for one-third of the daily turnover of 17,000 to 18,000 yuan at the end of the year, which shows the prosperity of the sales of daily necessities. According to the report of female interviewers, many housewives go to national product companies or national product factories to purchase daily necessities for their families recently. However, they still have some opinions, saying that although the quality of national products is not bad, the price is still a bit expensive, and the politeness of the shop assistants needs to be more courteous. Therefore, the reduction of costs of various factories and the training of company shop assistants are important issues in the future.

Second, Toys　During the Lunar New Year, nothing can affect children's education more than elders giving children New Year's money. For the sake of money, children do not hesitate to lower their ambitions and greet elders, which is the most corrupting habit of children's morality. We believe that it should be eliminated. One day, many educators gathered and advocated using toys to replace New Year's money, which was agreed by most people. It happened that Mr. Xiang Kangyuan was present, and everyone said, please Mr. Xiang to make more children's toys to meet the needs of this Lunar New Year. Mr. Xiang said that Kangyuan Factory is willing to use a large number of toys at low prices to meet these many wise elders. It is said that the sales of toys in the national product company this year are much better than in previous years. It is a pity that our propaganda of using toys to replace New Year's money has not been popularized. We hope to promote it greatly next year to correct this popular habit of worshiping money. At the same time, we also hope that Mr. Xiang will do his best to manufacture more varieties and reduce costs to benefit countless children in society.

Third, Food and Beverages　During the New Year, food also accounts for the majority of consumption. Just cakes and candies alone are considerable. It is said that Guanshengyuan's business during the Lunar New Year exceeds the usual monthly turnover by more than one week. In addition, the sales of various foods and beverages, such as dried goods, are many times higher than usual. These goods can be said to be domestic products now. This is very gratifying to the Chinese people.

Fourth, Clothing　Everyone likes to wear new clothes, new hats, and new shoes during the New Year, especially many children, so the sales of clothing also account for an important part. On New Year's Eve, I went to the national product company to buy jackets for children and hats and shoes for myself. The company has everything, especially the cheap and good quality of Huafu hats and the bright and clean color of Hongxin cloth, which can be said to be very satisfactory. Finally, I went to Sanyou Industrial Co., Ltd. and bought many children's supplies and local products, and felt that the shop assistants' full service spirit can be seen in the usual training. It is said that Sanyou's mail order department is completely dedicated to service. Customers in various places, no matter what goods they want to buy, the company can handle them according to their needs, making them satisfied. When I went to the third floor, I saw a shop assistant writing for customers. It is said that friends from Sichuan sent letters to entrust them to write. In short, if national product stores can take service as the starting point for business, the future is sure to be promising.

### New Year and National Products

— Ba Ling

Time flies, and the Year of the Ox has arrived, succeeding the Year of the Rat. This New Year of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937] has also followed the passage of time and arrived. As we stand on the position of promoting and using national products at this time of the New Year, we have infinite enthusiasm and hope for the future of the national product movement. I would like to express my humble opinion to share with fellow compatriots.

The New Year has arrived! My dear fellow countrymen and women, in this warm and sunny New Year, you will inevitably replace the old with the new for all your daily necessities, either buying all new items or purchasing them in moderation. This is almost inevitable. However, I sincerely hope that all compatriots will purchase as many national products as possible when purchasing supplies, and at the same time, sincerely persuade relatives and friends to jointly purchase from places that truly promote national products. If we can do this, the New Year's national product movement will definitely achieve a good situation due to the efforts of all compatriots. The difficulties of the national economy will also be reduced invisibly due to the development of the national product industry.

Some may say: "It is not that I do not accept national products, nor is it that I do not want to use national products, but today's national products have not yet reached the point of perfection that satisfies people." Alas! This statement is wrong. After more than ten years of efforts to promote Chinese national products, the exquisiteness of their products has improved significantly compared to the past. What is especially gratifying is that since the National Product Year of the 22nd year of the Republic [i.e., 1933], the efforts of the national product production community have been exceptionally admirable to us. Strictly speaking, their products have indeed gradually reached the status of "first-class national products," such as the cotton fabrics of Sanyou Industrial Co., Ltd., the medicines of Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Factory, the enamel products of China Enamel Factory, the underwear of Wuhe Weaving Factory, the cosmetics of Family Industrial Cooperative, the tonics of Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory, the various silks and satins of Meiya Silk Factory, and the toys and boxes of Kangyuan Factory. If we compare these national products with foreign goods, we dare to say that there is little difference between them.

Therefore, at this time when the beautiful New Year is approaching, I especially recommend various first-class national products to all compatriots. I hope that my compatriots will not purchase supplies unless they must, otherwise, I hope that they will only purchase and handle national products. If everyone can be consistent in this way, what about the development of the national product industry in this New Year?

### New Inventions by Chinese

— Xian

Mr. Liu Yonghui, a Chinese paper-making engineer who studied in Germany, recently invented a method of making paper from sorghum stalks at the Paper-Making Research Institute of the Dresden University of Technology, and the results are excellent. According to our country, paper has always been made from bamboo, rice straw, mulberry bark, rags, reeds, old paper, and bark as raw materials. However, bamboo, rice straw, and mulberry bark are only produced in the three provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi, and other provinces in the country produce very little. Therefore, there is a lack of raw materials, so the paper industry has not been able to develop. Now, if sorghum stalks are used instead, the output of sorghum stalks in the provinces of North China is very rich, and we will not have to worry about the lack of raw materials for making our own paper. This invention is the first wonderful flower in our national product industry this year.

### Some Ideas on Visiting

— Zhou Bangjun

National Product Visiting Seminar

Visiting is not an ordinary job. Every interviewer must have the following conditions:

First, Sufficient Knowledge is Required

Second, Considerable Experience is Required

Third, A Generous Attitude is Required

Fourth, Fluent Eloquence is Required

Therefore, interviewers are by no means ordinary talents who can undertake this important task. Especially in today's market, which is full of imported goods, and when people generally worship foreign goods, national product interviewers are not something that ordinary people can rashly undertake.

The scope of national product visits seems to be too broad, because every interviewer must have some considerable understanding of the factories entrusted to them; however, the organization and products of each factory are different, unless every product has been tested and there is some understanding of it, the wording during the visit will not be empty and abstract, and the belief of the interviewee will be firm. If you pick up the teeth of others, even if you can forcibly quibble and say a lot of nonsense, it is inevitable to arouse suspicion, and the entire visit will fail. To make up for this shortcoming, Bangjun thought of the need for a seminar, on the one hand, to invite the factory authorities to impart some necessary knowledge, and on the other hand, to solve the various difficulties that arise during the visit.

Since the importance of the seminar is as described above, then today we must talk about what needs to be said at the seminar:

First, Pay Attention to the Psychology of the Target　In other words, those who are responsible for visiting should be like nannies and elementary school teachers. They should abandon their own prejudices and cater to the other party's will, and then use a roundabout method to change the other party's psychology; if they do not abandon their own opinions and do not ask about other people's preferences, the result will only be annoying, so if the other party is a worshiper of foreign goods, then we should talk about national products from foreign goods: if they are enthusiastic promoters of national products, then we should tell them the method of identification, so that the other party can sincerely accept the visit.

Second, Avoid False Propaganda　Few national products can gain a foothold, and the crux of the matter is that the propaganda cannot be honest. The interviewer, of course, also has the task of propaganda, and should pay attention to this point. To avoid false propaganda, we must first conduct an investigation of the goods entrusted by the factory. We should have a deep understanding of the quality, efficacy, and decoration, so that we will not be dumbfounded when we visit. Or we will fall into false propaganda and destroy the achievements of the past work.

Third, Pay Attention to the Other Party's Environment　The person being visited may not necessarily have the purchasing power, or it may not be needed by everyone, and it is certain to make the other party accept the interviewer's opinion. This is going against the grain, and it will only cause unpleasant feelings. Therefore, when the interviewer arrives at the interviewee's home, they should first pay attention to the surrounding layout and determine the other party's environment. Then plan the outline of the visit, so that you can open up and reason. If you are a staunch pragmatist, it is difficult to visit cosmetic fragrances, which is not only ineffective, but also embarrassing. This is to lose the meaning of the visit.

Fourth, Cater to the Season and Needs　Visiting winter items in summer is untimely. The interviewer certainly understands these common sense, but the entrusting factory may have another reason why it must be included in the visit, then we can only adapt to the situation. As for the family being visited, if they are using a certain product, this central theme must not be abandoned, because just this one material can be used to develop one's own writing. Perhaps, by inferring from one example, we can incidentally promote other products; this is beneficial to all factories.

Fifth, Do Not Be Afraid to Seek Knowledge and Do Not Avoid Being Seen as Strange　The interviewer is not necessarily all-knowing and omnipotent. They should use their spare time to go to the entrusting factory to investigate the content of the products, and ask questions if they do not understand. They should make at least one visit to the person in charge of the factory every week to increase their knowledge. At the same time, they should often tell the factory authorities the criticisms of the interviewees, and report the common nature and value to the meeting for the factories to adopt and correct.

In short, the responsibility of the interviewer is very important, and the knowledge that the interviewer should have is very large, which cannot be fully covered by these few words. Fortunately, there are many opportunities for narration, and we may as well put forward more opinions to talk about.

### National Products and New Year Carnival

— Tian Ran

The gifts from various national product factories that we saw at the New Year Carnival hosted by the seven groups can be said to be the first-class national products. They are perfect and I can criticize them.

After many housewives received the gifts, they all said that these national products meet the standard national products in our ideal, and they are called first-class national products. Who would say it is not appropriate?

After many children received national product gifts, especially the toys made by Xiangyuan Can Factory were praised. Educational, national defense, scientific, and aesthetic, these innocent and lively children were overjoyed after receiving them, and they were ten times happier than receiving New Year's money. Some people say: In the future, it is better for elders to give toys to children than New Year's money, which is more meaningful and valuable.

### From "An Eye for an Eye" to National Product Toothpaste

— Diligence

The meaning of the phrase "an eye for an eye" is to want people to have the spirit of resistance and not to be timid or retreat.

The enemy uses economic aggression to plot against us, dumping a large number of goods. If we do not actively find ways to deal with it and do not develop our national products quickly, and just let the enemy's teeth bite, it will become our fatal wound, and our country's lifeline will also be bitten off by it! Therefore, we must defend our country, and we must sharpen our teeth, because teeth are really the most important thing for ourselves.

The condition for healthy teeth is brushing your teeth, and the toothpaste for brushing your teeth must be a national product. These words can be compared. The superior national toothpaste, "131 Toothpaste" from Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Factory, is prescribed by dental experts and supervised by pharmacists. It has the medicinal effects of cleaning teeth, neutralizing acid, sterilizing and antiseptic, and protecting tooth enamel, etc., which is enough for use.

The artificial pedal spinning wheel is widely used in the counties and villages of the former Songjiang Prefecture in Jiangsu Province, and Pudong is an example. The main components of its structure are: a large wheel disk, three yarn sprockets, and a pedal rod. The spinner sits and steps on the pedal rod with two feet, then the large wheel rotates, so the belt connected to the wheel and the sprockets also moves, and the yarn sprockets move accordingly. The cotton strip is drawn on the sprocket, thinned into yarn, and the yarn is wrapped around the sprocket by stopping or retreating the large wheel pedal rod. Its efficiency is indeed not weak. However, the method of use cannot be learned without practical learning, and it is really difficult to explain in words. The car is made purely of hardwood, and the price does not exceed five yuan. It can weigh 30 kilograms, and it can be 3 feet high and 5 feet long. It cannot be mailed. As for the freight to your place, it is difficult to estimate because the traffic situation is unclear.

### The Special Responsibility of Clothing Makers

— Jia Ding

Mr. Cheng Tianfang is a famous thinker in our country. In his article "A Draft Proposal for Reforming Chinese School Education," he strongly advocated that "vocational schools should not be divided into agricultural, industrial, and commercial departments, but should be divided into many different classes. What kind of people are needed in society, we should open that kind of class, and what is not needed in society, we should not make." For example, isn't clothing maker available in every city? Why doesn't the vocational school open a clothing class to adapt to the needs of society? "After graduation, the school will issue a license," and he can open his own clothing store or go to people's homes to do tailoring. His conclusion is well said: "The clothing makers trained in this way must be much better than the many uneducated clothing makers now. Not only can they make clothes, but they can also be called upon to take the responsibility of promoting national products. (Because the styles and qualities of many women's clothes are intentionally or unintentionally influenced by clothing makers.)"

I deeply believe that clothing is one of the important needs of life, and it is ranked alongside food, shelter, and transportation; and women need clothes more than men, and they have the power to advise men on their clothes. Clothing makers are specialized manufacturers of clothing. Although they are not able to be the masters of an employer in a blatant manner, they are inevitably the most active drivers of employers' consciousness in an invisible way; usually, when women make clothes, they always like to ask clothing makers for their opinions on the styles and materials of the clothes, not to mention men; at this time, clothing makers, in addition to doing their own professional skills planning, is a good opportunity to dedicate themselves to the magnificent national product promotion movement, and it is also a moment to fulfill the responsibility of a citizen to love the country. People who are currently serving as tailors, please think about it carefully!

If life permits, I think the best and most skilled clothing maker would never be willing to tailor clothes for employers without national fabric. Even if we step back and speak with some conscience, clothing makers, in this period of serious national crisis, must also do their best to sincerely persuade employers to buy as much national fabric as possible.

Spring and Autumn

### Mistake

— (Wei Ji)

Mistakes are inevitable for everyone. But as long as you correct your mistakes, it is like not making mistakes. So-called, avoiding mistakes is equal to having no mistakes!

Rather than advocating "do a good deed every day," why not advocate "correct a mistake every day"!

Every time you discover a mistake in yourself, it is a stimulus to yourself, and it is also an opportunity to strive for self-renewal!

The more times you discover mistakes, the more life experience you accumulate!

People who are not afraid to correct their mistakes are people with the strongest hope.

Mistakes are the ladder to help people improve!

People who are willing to make up their minds to correct their mistakes are better than those who have or do not have mistakes!

Someone who can always point out and correct my mistakes is my good friend!

If you can repent immediately after making a mistake, you are still a gentleman who "knows a mistake and is sure to improve."

Having a mistake is one mistake; not admitting a mistake is another mistake. If you admit it, both mistakes will be gone, and if you don't admit it, both mistakes will be inevitable. What is the point of those who argue to cover up their mistakes?

### Diplomacy that Fully Extends Righteousness

— The Truth

For the past sixty years, Japan's diplomacy towards China could be summed up with the phrases "eager for public interest" and "fond of boasting and deceit." (See Chen Zhenxian's preface to the first volume of "China and Japan in the Past Sixty Years," written in 1932.) As for the diplomacy of the Li Hongzhang style, opinions vary among the benevolent and the wise. After reviewing the entirety of the million-plus-word book, it is difficult to make a concise conclusion.

Recently, I happened to read "Maritime Anecdotes in Verse" by Ye Chucang, written in 1920, which recounts the words of Grand Secretary Li from the mouth of Sai Jinhua. It was as if the clouds had parted, surpassing the reading of the entire history of Sino-Japanese diplomacy of that time.

Ye's poem says: "How can a banquet compare to the intimacy of the bedchamber? (Rhyming with 'piao,' Ye's note) A spring night's gentle conversation surpasses grand schemes. Winning a single word from you creates a new precedent; Li Hongzhang, knowing my heart in the underworld." Ye added annotations to his original poem, which are recorded below:

"Sai Jinhua, the wife of a champion scholar, wandered for twenty years and returned to Shanghai. Her friend, Mr. Ma, was also a wild student in Shanghai twenty years ago. After the disaster, they embraced, as happy as in their youth. He once discussed world affairs with her, and she sighed, saying, 'Grand Secretary Li Hongzhang once said, "Grant whatever is permissible to outsiders quickly, to show my sincerity; reject whatever is impermissible immediately, to uphold my righteousness; there is nothing that cannot be done." Now, those who sit at the altar and preside over banquets are unwilling to grant and unable to reject. This is why the country is defeated!' Alas! The talent of a negotiator is despised and placed on par with a prostitute. How sad!"

Last year, Sai Jinhua passed away. My friend talked about Ye Chucang's "The Legend of Yiluan Palace," written in 1917, which seems like it could be completed and continued today.

### The Beauty of Black People

— Li Ping

In the eyes of Black people, the first condition for beauty is skin that is dark, and it must be so dark that it shines to be considered beautiful. That's why Black women apply coconut oil all over their bodies. The second condition is that the eyes should be as small as possible, the lips should be thick, and the nose should be as flat as a pancake. These are all conditions of beauty.

Black people also pay a lot of attention to hair, and you can tell from their hair whether they are married or unmarried. Married women often shave their heads into a bowl-shaped circle and glue the hair into a pointed shape with tree sap. Unmarried women braid their hair into several braids and glue them into a pen shape. They consider this to be beautiful.

Black people not only do not consider scars on a woman's face to be ugly, but they also believe that they are an indispensable part of beauty techniques. They deliberately tattoo flowers and create scars on the face, and they also color them in various colors, but red is the most popular.

Black people have never paid much attention to clothing. Usually, they only have a small loincloth. But one strange thing is that Black women often wrap a cloth band around their necks, supposedly to increase the length of their heads, which has great magical power.

### Cockfighting

— Hui Bo

My hometown, Henan, has a tradition of cockfighting. It is most popular from the twelfth lunar month, when farmers are idle, until January of the following year. During this time, children hold roosters that are supposed to be sacrificed to the Stove God and look for opponents.

There are no conditions for cockfighting. As long as the opponents meet, they release their roosters to fight each other. Although the roosters are majestic, they are not comparable to humans. Therefore, although they have a haughty and self-important appearance, they never shout "Traitor, take my blade!" or "Submit to me and live, resist me and die!" They simply glare at each other, spread their wings, and extend their iron beaks and sharp spurs, fighting back and forth. The winner crows triumphantly (over the flock of hens), proudly dominating the area, while the loser flees with its head down.

There are many reasons for their fighting: to possess all the hens in the area, to show off their power, or perhaps for other reasons.

The people who watch cockfighting do so for entertainment. They enjoy seeing feathers plucked from each other's mouths and drops of blood falling on the ground and on the feathers. Even a snow-white rooster can be stained pink, completely changing its appearance due to the fighting. However, it is only praised and petted by children who love to watch the excitement. What people really like are beautiful, majestic roosters that crow diligently (that is, crow at dawn) and do not run around in the wild. They carefully protect them, preventing vicious roosters from harming them.

So I think: It would be best if roosters also had a school to teach them some knowledge so that they could understand their mission. However, this would definitely be opposed by children who love to watch the excitement.

### Cow Talk

— Zhou Xian

This year is the Year of the Ox, so let's talk about oxen.

Among the twelve zodiac animals, the most useful, the most hard-working, the most abused by humans, and at the same time, the most striving for survival are the ox and the horse. The contribution of the ox seems even greater than that of the horse. Although horses held an important position in national defense in ancient times, their importance has diminished due to the progress of modern tactics. Although agriculture is also trending towards mechanization, the labor of oxen is still indispensable in China's agricultural sector. As for the other ten zodiac animals, they are not worth mentioning.

The ox's contribution to humans is not only that its labor can be used for plowing fields, but also that milk, beef, butter, and bone marrow are all excellent nutrients for humans. Furthermore, hide and bones are excellent materials for industrial products. Oxen's labor can help human production, their milk and meat can provide human nutrition, and their hides and bones can be used for industrial manufacturing. The ox's contribution to humanity is so great, but its consumption is lower than that of ordinary animals. It eats dried grass, bean cakes, and free-growing wild grass. It lives in sheds behind houses, suffering from cold in winter and heat in summer. However, humans have absolutely no sympathy for it, driving it and whipping it. When it is old and sick, it is still slaughtered and its carcass is butchered, its hide and bones removed for profit. However, the ox knows to strive for survival. Every ox seems to know innately that only through effort can it survive in this world. So its heavy body always strives forward, and even when it is panting, it still uses its last breath to take its last step.

From the ox's lifestyle, I feel that China, in some ways, is too much like an ox. Look, the inexhaustible and inexhaustible treasures are just like an ox's milk, meat, and leather, with nothing wasted, right? And the low labor costs in the country and the Chinese people's habit of being hardworking, in the eyes of foreigners, are simply as cheap and effective as using the strength of an ox. The fact that overseas Chinese are being squeezed out everywhere is a good proof of this. And although we Chinese are creating happiness for humanity everywhere in this world of the survival of the fittest, the reward we get is discrimination, exclusion, and even being slaughtered and trampled on. How sad is that? However, even though the reward we get is like this, we are still working hard, promoting the culture of this world, never afraid, never discouraged. How great is this spirit?

However, although China and the ox are so similar, the ox is, after all, an ox, and China is, after all, China. Although the ox is exploited and cut off by others, we Chinese are now awake, and exploitation and slaughter are no longer allowed. What we have is the ox's rich resources, the ox's hard work, and the ox's understanding of life, but we also have the knowledge that the ox does not have. We will combine all the strengths that the ox has and the strengths that the ox does not have to help complete the new China—this is what we should be vigilant about in this Year of the Ox.

We are ultimately not oxen, and we will not allow others to exploit or slaughter us!

### Mated Mandarin Ducks

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Chapter 11 (Murmurs of Compassion from the Curtain; Repenting and Sacrificing Filial Piety; Autumn Light Dimming, Green Eyebrows Stirred by the Scene)

Menglan snorted through her nose and laughed, "Second Sister-in-law, you can be called a female Su Qin." The Second Young Mistress said, "What do you mean by that? I don't understand. Don't try to impress me with antiques." Menglan said, "You can't not understand. It means that person who became the prime minister of the six states." The Second Young Mistress smiled and nodded a few times, saying, "Oh, oh, oh? I understand. Are you accusing me unfairly? I won't say. How did you see that I am a female Su Qin?" Menglan said, "First, send me a few pots of chrysanthemums to make me happy. Then come upstairs and chat with me slowly. By talking and talking, you can bring out what you want to say. Your coming here is not only your intention, but Mother also knows, so she specially brewed a pot of tea for the two of us to drink." The Second Young Mistress took a sip of tea and smiled, "Sister, you are too smart." Menglan laughed, "Did I guess it right with just one guess?" The Second Young Mistress wore a blue short silk jacket with narrow sleeves, and two gold bracelets were on her sleeves, which made her muscles look even more full. Her hand holding the teacup would occasionally lift to tidy her hair. Her round face and big eyes revealed a bit of loyalty. Seeing Menglan just staring at her, she smiled and said, "Sister, are you wronging a good person? I have always thought this way. You are always frowning, so I should find a way to relieve your boredom. Your eldest sister-in-law even thinks I am meddling. Why would I want to add to your troubles? You said that Mother and I agreed in advance, that's even more wrong. You are a clever ghost, you can't hide anything from you, would Mother reveal anything in front of you?" Menglan said, "But this tea is indeed from Mother's storage." The Second Young Mistress put down the teacup, clapped her hands, and the gold bracelets rang out. She laughed, "It is indeed the tea from Mother's room. She can generously send good tea for you and me to drink, that's genuine." Menglan took the teacup and sipped it slowly, drinking it all up. She still held the cup in her hand, looking at it upside down. The Second Young Mistress smiled, "Sister, think carefully, am I really a female Su Qin?" Menglan smiled, "I'm sorry if I said it wrong, don't take it to heart." The Second Young Mistress smiled, "I only feel sorry for you, why would I blame you." Menglan smiled, "I am also a young lady from an upper-middle-class family, why do you feel sorry for me?" The Second Young Mistress was caught off guard by this sentence and didn't know how to answer. Seeing the teapot still on the table, she picked up the pot and poured a cup first. Then, she took Menglan's teacup and poured another cup and handed it to her, smiling, "This tea tastes good, have another cup." (134)

### Tomorrow's America

— Huang Yuzhen

The customs, habits, and all modern social organizations in the United States are like scientific formulas. When I first arrived in the United States, I felt stressed and amazed everywhere! But taking an ordinary city as an example, it is like Avenue Joffre on Christmas Eve in Shanghai, or Nanjing Road on Saturday. Pedestrians, cars, and all kinds of interactions are all incredibly rushed. The facilities in houses and institutions are also the same as what we see in foreign houses and companies in Shanghai. But Americans' progress and reform are exceptionally swift. Therefore, general prognosticators often predict that the future of the United States will either be a complete reversal of fortune or complete decay.

Once, I listened to a lecture by Dr. Mj-Bume, an American social psychologist. He deduced future progress from the current social psychology of the United States, and I found it very interesting. Now I will briefly introduce his arguments, according to what I can remember:

(1) Transportation and Transit: He said that future streets in the United States will definitely have two layers, and cars can pass on both the upper and lower layers. Because the land value in cities is expensive, the alleys in the streets will be like the current main roads, where trams can travel back and forth. Street signs will be set up to alert people to traffic conflicts; pedestrian rules will be set to protect pedestrians' lives. Underground walkways will be set up in areas with heavy traffic. The road will be divided into three layers: the first layer for trams, the second layer for light cars, doctor cars, etc.; and the third layer for pedestrians. All three layers can be freely raised and lowered. Therefore, people on the upper layer can go to the lower layer, and people on the lower layer have the same freedom. Future airplanes can walk on the road and fly freely. In the center of the city or on the rooftop, there will be places for airplanes to land. Every few miles, there will be the establishment of the airport station to benefit flying and can arbitrarily move forward to the street, as the current car is the same. People can take planes to travel around the world at will. The equipment inside this kind of aircraft is indeed the same as the equipment inside the ship: there are rooms, there are dining rooms, there are reading rooms, there are smoking places, there are radio stations. The use of aircraft in the industry will be more active in the future. In commerce, in the postal service, in the navigation aspect, the aircraft will be used greatly, running across the oceans, covering the world. The driving of the ship, the train, the car will use electricity. The speed increases, will count the ship, eight miles per minute; train seventeen miles per minute; car - miles per minute. The vehicles employed on the current street, such as cars, automatic vehicles, streetcars, machine pedal cars, etc., must all be driven by electricity.

(2) Construction and Equipment: The tile surface and walls will be made of copper. The floor and pillars will be built of thick glass. Door handles and utensils will be made of silver-nickel. The rooftops of residential houses will all be equipped with gardens. Small parks will be set up in the streets for pedestrians to enjoy at will. All shops and buildings will be equipped with ice pipes and hot pipes. This kind of gas supply company, either commercial or state-run, is like today's electric lights and water companies. The cold and warm climate can be absolutely harmonized. Washing clothes and washing dishes at home now takes a lot of labor and time, and in the future, electricity will be used instead. This kind of machine is like today's sweeper. All dirty clothes, dishes, etc. can be put in the electric stove and washed clean by mechanical power. The phone can be made to the people on the plane in the air, the people in the car when driving, or the people on the train.

(3) Schools and Families: Professors will be changed to lectures, using the method of broadcasting, so that many people can listen. People who want to study only need to install a radio, so they don't need to go to school. Therefore, future education will definitely become extremely popular. Families will become like hotels, with only comfortable boarding houses and all beautiful facilities. Cooking at home will definitely disappear. When eating, either go to a restaurant or buy food back, because all food can be cooked, made, and packaged by others, just like the bread we buy today. Marriage must be done by trial marriage procedures. Marriage is not limited to national boundaries and is not restricted by ethnicity, and the world will definitely be realized.

These arguments are what Dr. Berne predicts. I am afraid that in the near future, the social culture of the United States will really be realized in this way, because the progressive, curious, and reforming psychology of Americans is sharper than any race in the world!

Supplement to the Local News of Shen Bao

Talks

### Organizing a Volunteer Police Force

— I

Yesterday, I saw in the newspaper that the Songjiang County Government, in order to strengthen local self-defense forces, had a proposal to organize a volunteer police force. A meeting was convened earlier to prepare for it. The members are required to be graduates of junior high school or above and have a legitimate occupation or property. The county magistrate serves as the captain, and the police chief serves as the deputy captain. I don't know whether this system is implemented according to the province's regulations or is an innovation of the county, but I had this idea twenty or thirty years ago. The reason for initiating this method is very simple. The security of a place relies entirely on a few policemen and local troops, which is not reliable at all. The security of a place can only be achieved by the people of the place themselves.

To expand on this, not only is this the case for the local area, but also for the country. A country can only be maintained by all the people. Relying entirely on the country's troops is probably not enough. Therefore, the organization of a local volunteer police force can not only maintain the security of a local area, but also maintain the security of a country. Therefore, it is said, "If you want to be stable, you must do it yourself;" and "Self-reliance." If a country relies solely on other countries as a savior, then the country will perish. The tactics of alliance and division can only be effective for a certain period of time and cannot be regarded as a panacea. The principle of a country's strength or weakness is originally like this, and in the current environment, this idea should be developed and expanded. The way to establish a country is here, and so is the way to establish oneself and one's family.

Since the rise of Fascism, countries that advocate justice and peace have been in a position of the survival of the fittest, unable to extricate themselves. They have no choice but to unite to expand their military preparations and strengthen their military force to reverse the decline. In the current trend, non-armed forces are not enough to speak of peace, and only armed forces can hope for peace, which is very obvious. Therefore, it is said, "Kill to stop killing, and killing can be stopped." Mr. Einstein is a pacifist, but now he tells his friends that pacifism is useless. Now you can only support the war and help the war. The country is formed by the accumulation of people. If the people themselves stand on the Qinglongtou to watch the killing and are unwilling to serve on the battlefield, there is no way to do it. Therefore, to strengthen the country, the people must first strengthen themselves; to maintain the security of the local area, we must first maintain the security of the country; to maintain the security of the country, this system should be promoted throughout the country. If this system is implemented in a county, the county will benefit; if it is implemented in a province, the province will benefit; if it is implemented throughout the country, the country will benefit. Therefore, the volunteer police system should be implemented throughout the country, not just in a county or township.

### Night of the God of Wealth

— Hua

On this day, the six of them filled their stomachs with food very early in the morning to prepare for a good sale.

The six of them were busy all day long. They borrowed ten yuan of usurious money from Zhao Mazi and borrowed a red robe and a set of gongs and drums from the Wufu Weiyang Grand Theater. This was thanks to Liu Dakuaizi's reputation, otherwise, where would they borrow from?

Liu Dakuaizi was tall and handsome, and they called him the God of Wealth. His face was covered with gold powder, leaving only two eyes and a mouth. He wore the red robe, put on a pair of boots, and held two gold ingots in his hands. In this way, he was already a God of Wealth.

Zhao Ada was good at saying auspicious words. He wore a long gown and held a square plate in his hand. On the plate were Zhao Mazi's ten yuan. They thought: If they did this, people would see whole banknotes, and they might know that they couldn't spend too much, so they would make a fortune. The others played the gongs and drums and followed behind.

A group of children followed them, joining in the fun.

Liu Dakuaizi ran like crazy to a decent-looking store, jumping around and performing a "show"? Then, Zhao Ada went up with a smile and said, "Sir, the God of Wealth has sent ingots. Congratulations, congratulations."

The "sir" was very stingy and only threw down a few coppers.

"Sir, raise it a little, the God of Wealth has come, it doesn't matter."

"Take it away, I've been asked like this six times, how can I spend it? The year is not good."

"Sir, raise it a little, it's only once a year."

Finally, he got six more coppers, and left very dissatisfied.

The second door had a notice from the lawyer for liquidation. What about the third one, they thought. But the third door had a pair of Spring Festival couplets pasted on it, which read, "Implement a new life, abolish old habits."

They thought, did they not even want the God of Wealth?

The night gradually faded away, and they went from house to house with a full of hope, trying to satisfy their desires.

### Father and Daughter

— Na

The sunlight filtered through the damp mist, descending once more upon this vast village.

The entire street lay still like a hibernating beast, with about eleven or twelve small shops crowded on either side like claws. The doors of the shops, starting from the first one, were slowly pulled open, and the young shop assistants lazily poked their heads out, inquiring after each other. Suddenly, a piece of news spread from the greengrocer's shop, quickly picked up by the early morning customers, flowing like a storm throughout the village's thatched huts and coconut groves.

The first to bring this news was an old woman, who said with the interest of someone chewing candy:

"Open the door, sister-in-law!" I thought: Who could it be? Coming to knock on doors so early in the morning. So I stuck my head out of the window, but it was still dark, and I couldn't see who it was.

"Who are you, what's the matter?" I asked loudly.

"Our Deborah Resi hasn't come here, has she? She disappeared from my house in the middle of the night..." a familiar voice answered.

"No, she hasn't! No, she hasn't!" I knew who it was, I replied, thinking: This little girl won't leave her house except to run off with someone, you know how strict her father is! But I didn't say it, I was afraid of hurting the old man's feelings...

Everyone on the street remembered this unfortunate old man. By this time, he had searched the entire village, feeling sad and exhausted, and had gone home to cry.

Three years ago, he was a coachman. Somehow, he suddenly felt that the end of the world had arrived, and that all of humanity, regardless of poverty, would be burned by God's phosphorus fire. So, he sold his horse and carriage and drank it all away. When drunk, he would go out bareheaded, waving his arms and stamping his feet in the street, his mouth frothing, shouting loudly: "The Last Judgment is coming, brothers and sisters! The Last Judgment is coming..."

And so, in his hazy, drunken eyes, he would see how God's phosphorus fire was burning down the village's thatched huts and fields, and how humanity was suffering the Last Judgment. Because of this, he was often mocked by people, and mischievous youths would tie his hands behind his back and drag him to the water tap, pouring cold water over his head. The village chief also often punished him by putting him in jail.

"Everyone is hostile to me, they insult and beat me. Friends, truly, they will inflict every imaginable disaster upon me."

He would say this to all strangers, his aging eyes filled with sorrowful tears.

It was said that he had also had good days. He had three daughters. Although his wife had died early, they lived happily. Soon, his first daughter committed suicide because of love, and his second daughter ran away with a coconut merchant without a word. From then on, their lives were shrouded in a thick shadow.

He imposed an astonishingly strict surveillance on his third, grown-up daughter.

"She, a very unfortunate child, has been making a living with her own small hands since she was thirteen. But I don't want her to continue like this, following the path her sisters took. I want her to live a decent life..."

So, he forbade her from attending various gatherings and rejected the young men who courted her. But, when he was drunk, she would slip away from his side like a shadow and immediately rush into another thatched hut, where a pair of strong arms were waiting for her. Until he was dragged to the water tap for a cold shower, he would wipe the water from his head, shake like a rooster, and run all over the coconut grove, searching the thatched huts of acquaintances, and then put on a very angry face:

"I'm going to break your legs, you slut! Do you know you've committed a sin? God doesn't allow this..."

The daughter would shed tears, without saying a word.

"Promise me you won't do this again..."

She nodded slightly, finally agreeing. Then, he would make the sign of the cross to heaven, reciting a penitential psalm, and she would do the same. Only then would he sigh as if a heavy burden had been lifted: "Good! Now you are free!"

He did this for years, which passed like a day, but finally he failed, and she was led away from his side by strong arms.

In the afternoon, this unfortunate old man appeared on the street again, as before. He was drunk, bareheaded, barefoot, carrying a burlap sack, leaning on a gnarled wooden cane, walking hunched over, followed by a crowd of people shouting at him, throwing stones, and threatening him with their fists, but he acted as if nothing was happening, minding his own way.

"Hey, where are you going?" someone shouted at him.

"To another world, because it's lonely here..."

After saying that, he walked out of the village without looking back, the shadows of the palm trees swallowing him like a pair of black wings.

### Dispute

— Ping Jun

After telling me the reason why he remained a bachelor, the stationed customs inspector Fu Changming, then shifted to other issues. He leaned close to my ear and said intimately, "Your station is just bad because there are no foreigners. It's different in our customs."

His manner of speaking was very uncouth, even though he was said to have received a secondary education. He often inserted too many "嗄" sounds and English single words, but mispronounced them. This made one weary of even an interesting and worthwhile topic of discussion.

In that messy and unadorned conversation, he also mentioned that Europeans and Americans marry late, "Foreigners marrying in their thirties and forties is very common. Isn't King Edward VIII a good example?"

I told everyone about these words, especially emphasizing the phrase "the station has no foreigners." The baggage clerk Guo Boxiang, a man from the West, was the first to jump up.

"Damn it, the whole of China is ruined by that bunch of traitorous scoundrels. Chinese agencies using foreigners...! Foreign slaves, down with them—"

The telegraph operator Chen Ke, whose actions were cunning, insidious, and as poisonous as a wild wolf, dragged Guo Boxiang outside and muttered to him for a long time.

In an accidental quarrel, Guo Boxiang, incited by Chen Ke, started fighting with Fu Changming.

"If you have the ability, go fight the ×× people."

Fu Changming's body was thin and short, his skin had many brownish-yellow spots due to paleness, his small eyes showed a gray and listless color, and his limbs and features all suffered from incomplete development. Unable to withstand the brute force of the Shanxi man, he fell to the foot of the wall. He covered his nose with his thin hand, which was nothing but skin and bones, and made a faint, weak sound, as if a newly born kitten had suffered a huge trauma.

This is something worth studying for psychologists: what is the psychology of an arrogant, narrow-minded, and selfish character after being shamed in public.

As a result, no one saw him open his mouth to smile for more than a week.

However, Chen Ke's vicious methods were once again displayed to everyone. He stroked Fu Changming's thin arm and said, "We really consider your misfortune to be a regrettable thing, but you must forgive him because our stationmaster is not a foreigner."

The short, humiliated man cracked a pale, bitter smile on his face.

"嗄, no fear 嗄, if you have the ability, go fight, fight 嗄..."

This difficult situation was resolved when I dragged him out for a walk.

We walked silently along the tracks.

The train roared across the fields. -- The air was noisy, clamorous, and turbulent, like a cavalry suddenly appearing in a surprise attack. But immediately, tranquility, with a hand that extinguished the buds of chaos, quickly restored all disturbances to calm.

Fu Changming's life was truly pitifully monotonous. After work, he didn't know how to use his limited spare time and wasted much precious time on drinking, gambling, and visiting brothels (though perhaps only once). As a result, his personality became irritable, selfish, stupid, stubborn, suspicious, and greedy...

He told me that he had quickly restored his friendship with Guo Boxiang:

"Old Guo is an honest man."

Three days after the fight, the drunken Shanxi man vomited a mouthful of wine on him and said, "We are all good friends, people who are away from home rely on friends, Chen Ke ridiculed me for being a pus-filled bag, saying I couldn't beat you, now I've shown him."

### Life

— Huisheng

"Life and death hang in the balance," this is a common Shanghai saying, meaning that life is in danger.

For example, if a person is careless about their diet and develops a serious illness, but then recovers thanks to good fortune, they will say when others ask about their illness: "Life and death hung in the balance!"

Life is the most precious thing, and illness endangers life! Therefore, if a person is sick, whether it is mild or severe, they should quickly take effective medicine. Otherwise, not only will "life and death hang in the balance," but they will also "lose their life," which is lamentable!

Where can you buy effective medicine? I don't need to say much, of course, the products of the Wuzhou Pharmacy are the most reliable. Wuzhou's 300 kinds of household medicines are all effective. Patients should buy and take the medicine that matches their symptoms, and they won't have to fear that "life and death hang in the balance."

### Short Stories (Three)

— Lu

Everyone Has a Cough

These past few days, the northwest wind has been blowing very hard. Zhang's wife has a cough, and Li's grandmother also has a cough. Uncle Wu said: "Quickly buy a bottle of 'Mai Ye Cough Syrup' to take. I guarantee your coughs will stop after taking it." (Cough syrup is a Wuzhou product)

Sores Are Healed

Little brother had to go to school every morning, so he got chilblains on his feet, which were red, swollen, painful, and itchy. It was truly unbearable! Later, his father bought chilblain medicine from the Wuzhou Pharmacy and applied it to him, and his chilblains quickly healed.

Economical Beauty

Elder sister spent forty cents to buy a pound of "Beauty Cream" from the Wuzhou Pharmacy, took it home, and filled two large jars, enough for the whole family to use for half a year. So everyone said she was an economical beauty expert.

It is said that the rift between Fu Changming and Chen Ke was because Fu Changming once visited a prostitute, and Chen Ke discovered this secret and revealed it to everyone. As a result, a deadly feud was formed.

"Even some ascetic monks will occasionally break their vows. Should we not be too demanding of a bachelor who has never had a single exception?" Chen Ke said humorously. His subtle narratives often added a lot of interest to the story itself...

We returned to the station. Fu Changming shook my hand, as if concluding, and said: "In short, conspiracy, our national character is ruined by conspiracy."

His shortsightedness caused his observation to fail. -- Why couldn't he discover the conspiracy of our common enemy? Why don't we feel resentment when we suffer major insults from others?

But that selfish fellow was never willing to "repent" of his mistakes.

### Dream

— Kong Fang

Dreams are beautiful, the hopes in dreams are bright, the realms in dreams are vivid. I like dreams, and I often dream.

During the day, dissatisfaction and anger with the reality fill my chest, suffocating me. I spend my days suffocating like this.

But at night, I begin to seek sweetness in dreams. The world I dream of is ideal. There is no sorrow, no worry, only happiness and joy fill the entire realm. There is no poverty and wealth, no toil and ease, only each person doing their best. I forget reality there, but once I remembered it, and I said in surprise:

"How different this world is from the other one!"

"This is the world of dreams," someone replied.

"How was this world built?"

"With blood and flesh."

"Blood and flesh?" I didn't believe it. I lowered my head to look, ah? This ground was actually a crystallization of blood and flesh. I raised my head, ah? Those buildings, those high-rises, were all blood...flesh...

Then I woke up with a start.

I was puzzled by my dream.

Perhaps others will laugh at my dream, but let them laugh: who in the world doesn't dream! I must still bravely pursue my own dreams.

Although dreams may only be dreams, dreams are the mother of everything. When there are no dreams, there is no world.

Movies

### 1937 Style Love

Nanjing Will Show "Streamlined Love"

Director Van Dyke's latest elaborate creation, "Streamlined Love," will be screened at the Nanjing Grand Theater this Thursday. The film is full of intense passion and a brand new kind of romantic sentiment, like a cluster of fiery red tulips by the waterside on a spring morning, or like a glass of clear amber champagne under the tempting light of goose-yellow. This film is Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's greatest success in years. The stars are Hollywood's number one woman, the hot girl Joan Crawford from "Political Sea Heroines," and the tough, passionate heartthrob Clark Gable, with supporting roles by Joan Crawford's true love interest, Franchot Tone, and Regina Owen, among others.

### World Epic "Loyalty and Righteousness"

Premiering Tonight at the Grand Theater

The world-shaking, historically tragic, and romantic epic "Loyalty and Righteousness" Lloyds of Locdon, is scheduled to premiere tonight (Wednesday) at 9:15 PM at the Grand Theater. The film tells the story of Nelson and Jonathan, who were very good friends in childhood. Later, because they discovered the secret plan of the pirates on the beach, which was detrimental to the Lloyds of London insurance company, Jonathan, valuing righteousness, traveled hundreds of miles to London to report the news, while Nelson was taken away by his uncle at this time to be a cadet in the navy. From then on, Jonathan served in the Lloyds insurance company, while Nelson had a smooth career, rising to the rank of admiral of the navy. Later, because Napoleon disturbed the whole of Europe and merchant ships often encountered danger, the company colleagues wanted to ask Nelson to allocate a part of the fleet to escort the merchant ships, but Jonathan, because the strength of the navy was related to the safety of the country, uniquely disagreed. Fortunately, a wealthy woman expressed sympathy to him. Later, although Nelson died for his country, Napoleon was greatly defeated, Jonathan really made a great contribution, and the Fux Administration specially invited Henry King to direct this film. The lead roles are played by the beautiful star Madeleine Carroll, the little star Freddie Bartholomew, and the dashing star Tyrone Power, among others. When this film was screened simultaneously in major theaters in the United States, the seat prices were increased, but the Grand Theater, in order to maintain its principle of never increasing prices, still charges the original price.

### Xinhua Variety Records

The suspenseful and terrifying blockbuster "Midnight Song," directed by Ma-Xu Weibang, will be screened at the Jincheng Theater, following "New Year's Money." This film has a reasonable story, correct consciousness, and the performance is extremely bizarre, making one's hair stand on end.

"Midnight Song" has three songs: one is the theme song, one is Hot Blood, and the other is Huanghe Love, all of which are extremely melodious and moving.

The location shooting for "Midnight Song" was in Suzhou and Hangzhou, rich in poetic and picturesque scenes.

Zhou Wenzhu, after a long absence, plays a wizened old woman with wrinkled skin and white hair in "Midnight Song," and her performance is quite humorous.

In "Midnight Song," there is a scene where the tower is overturned while chasing the "monster" Jin Shan, with over a thousand people participating in the performance, making it extremely lively.

The production of "Xiangjiang Night Rain" has reached a critical stage.

Chen Juanjuan plays the daughter of Diao Banhua in "Xiangjiang Night Rain." According to the plot, the second half is almost entirely her acting world.

"Youth March" has begun in full swing. The play was written by Tian Han and has a serious element of Sorin, but the performance takes a relaxed tone, and Shi Dongshan attaches great importance to it.

In addition to Hu Ping, another female lead in "Youth March" is Tong Yuejuan, who won excellent reputation in "Peach Blossom Spring Dream."

Yang Xiaozhong will shoot the humorous and idealistic blockbuster "Shanghai Beach Sixty Years Later," with the original cast of "Peach Blossom Spring Dream," Han Lan'gen, Liu Jiqun, etc.

### Summary of Safety Features in 1937 Model Cars

— Ling Yun

Brakes Offer Maximum Power and Other Equipment Strives for Safety Assurance

The characteristics of the 1937 model cars have been repeatedly documented in this publication. To mention the most prominent ones, there are the ease of driving, the prevalence of mechanical power, the comfort of riding, and the beauty of the design. However, there is one more crucial point that car users must not overlook: the greatest efforts made in terms of safety in the new cars, resulting in more perfect achievements. We need not elaborate on the value of cars and their wide range of uses. However, after purchasing a car, anyone will travel hundreds of thousands of miles. During this long journey, whether for business use or leisure travel, although the purposes may vary, the desire for reliable service is universal. Therefore, the occurrence of accidents is not only heartbreaking for the car owner but also unwelcome by the manufacturers. Yet, accident reports are constantly appearing. The records in newspapers would exhaust the bamboo of the Southern Mountains. What is the reason for this? Is it due to the manufacturer's oversight or human error?

Car manufacturers have learned from the past and realized the complexity of this problem. They know that a solution cannot be achieved overnight. Therefore, they have made the most precise considerations in their due diligence, so that safety is also given considerable value in the overall development of the new cars. Thus, when the 1937 new cars are launched, it would be absurd to guarantee that accidents will not occur. However, new cars have indeed made significant progress in the degree of effort put into safety facilities in terms of mechanical structure. If they can be used properly and the principles of rationalization are not violated in driving, then the reduction and prevention of accidents are not unattainable. It all depends on human effort and cannot be generalized. The main points regarding the safety of new cars are as follows:

Tire blowouts, although not a major disaster, can lead to unimaginable accidents if the driver mishandles the situation. In recent years, thanks to the research and thinking of chemists, the manufacturing of tires has been refined, and such incidents have become rare. Brakes are the lifeline of safe driving. If this device fails, the occurrence of accidents is almost certain. Such is their importance. The brakes of the 1937 model cars are all strong and reliable, focusing on power. They can respond easily to sudden changes, with the ability to control the smallest details and release great power. Therefore, when the car is not traveling too fast, it can come to a complete stop immediately when needed, as stable as Mount Tai. If you want to accelerate immediately while driving, it is essential to have a large amount of reserved power. This is something that most mechanical scholars can explain. The new cars meet this requirement, with ample power reserved and ready to accelerate as much as possible. The car roof is the highest point of the car and must be strong enough to look down from above. The new car roofs are all made of strong metal, and their load-bearing capacity is several times higher than the weight of the entire car. One manufacturer, to show the strength of its new car's roof, built a farmhouse on top of its sample car, which was surprisingly stable and extraordinary. Those who saw it were amazed.

Car users expect everything from new cars, and new cars seem to follow their instructions one by one. What customers don't want, manufacturers will eliminate. What customers expect, manufacturers will gather. This is why new cars can satisfy people's wishes. Unpleasant noises while driving and miscellaneous engine noises are not liked by passengers, and they have now been eliminated. For safety reasons, the power of the brakes must be huge, as mentioned earlier, and now each manufacturer is following suit. The one-piece solid steel body is a great guarantee of safe riding. Better uniformity and spring suspension have become popular. This is closely related to the comfort of riding. Now, riding in a new car is like sitting in an armchair while traveling on the road. The center of gravity of the car has also been moved down so that the car can adhere to the road surface even more, making it safer. Safety glass, also known as shatterproof glass, has been regarded as a necessary standard equipment for all cars. (To be continued)

### Overview of the 1937 Chevrolet Car

— Fu

The 1937 Chevrolet car, known as "the best and most perfect new product" in the world, is now on display in the showroom of the local dealer, Li Wei Automobile Company, at 100 Meyer Road. It is scheduled to be officially exhibited within a few days to make its first appearance to the people of Shanghai. The author will briefly describe its overview as follows to provide information to readers.

The new Chevrolet is divided into two major groups: the Leader Series and the Deluxe Series. Each group has six body styles. In terms of the chassis, engine, or car body, these two groups of new products are the same without any difference. The only differences are the front spring suspension, rear axle, steering gear ratio, as well as decoration and accessory installation. Knee-action was previously installed separately and charged extra, but now it has become a standard feature on the Deluxe Chevrolet new car, without the need for additional costs. As for the Leader Series new car, it is equipped with elliptical front springs. The wheelbase of both groups of new cars is 112 and a quarter inches.

Regarding the various aspects that have been specially improved and refined, the common features of the two groups of new cars are the brand-new six-cylinder overhead valve engine. In addition to being lighter and extremely strong, it is quieter and more powerful than before. Therefore, at any speed, its original power and torque are stronger, and its effectiveness is unprecedented. In addition, the common feature of the two groups of new cars is the streamlined body. This body is made of all-steel construction and is absolutely quiet. Furthermore, due to the use of a suspended rear axle and a bridge-type frame, the body is lower and the length is slightly increased. The beauty of its style and the safety and comfort enjoyed by those who are in it have reached the peak, far beyond the reach of ordinary vehicles in the same price range. The suspended rear axle was previously only used in expensive vehicles. Now, the new Chevrolet also has this device, which is truly a pioneering feat in low-priced vehicles. In addition, all models of the new Chevrolet are equipped with safety glass, without additional charges. This is also rare and uncommon in low-priced cars.

The seats of the new Chevrolet are wider, and the head and legroom are greatly increased. The windshield area is larger, and the corner pillars are narrower, so the line of sight is clearer. The doors and windows have been widened, and the luggage space has been greatly increased. The front seat is flexible and can be adjusted at will to enjoy extreme comfort. The gauges and controllers have been redesigned and their positions have been corrected. The windshield has just the right inclination, so there is no risk of refraction or glare. With all these advantages, the safety, comfort, and convenience of the new car are outstanding and unmatched.

The frames of the Chevrolet Deluxe and Leader Series new cars are both exceptionally strong and lightweight bridge types, safe, reliable, and durable. As for the transmission, the transmissions installed on both groups of cars are synchronized. The brakes are both improved and refined hydraulic types. With these equipments, the driving is extremely simple, flexible, and safe.

### Washing Machine Motor Converted into a Small Car

— (Y)

Biel, a resident of William City, New Jersey, USA, recently hand-built a small car. Its engine is a converted washing machine motor, and the car body is made of plywood. The picture shows the full appearance of this small car. Although small in shape, it is actually streamlined. The power of the engine allows it to travel 14 to 16 miles per hour on a good road.

### The Exhibition of the New Oldsmobile Car is Scheduled

According to reliable information, the 1937 model of the new Oldsmobile car has arrived in Shanghai and will soon be officially exhibited at the United Motor Company on Meyer Road. It is also heard that in addition to the more beautiful appearance and the more luxurious interior decoration of the new car, the entire structure and mechanical engineering are even more advanced than before. Therefore, its strength, consolidation, economic endurance, and the fullness of the machine power and the greatness of its effect are unmatched.

### Camera on the Car Windshield

— (Y)

There is a three-lens camera that hangs on the windshield. When another car violates traffic laws while driving, it can automatically take three clear photos and record the time and date on them. After one use, the film can be automatically converted for the next application. The three pictures here are the three types of photos actually taken. The first larger picture shows the route of the violating car and its location relative to other cars and pedestrians. The two pictures below are close-ups, and the license plate number of the violating car can also be clearly identified. The inventor of this machine is Mr. Fei Qierte of Washington, USA. He suggested that the police authorities adopt this machine. Anyone who voluntarily installs this machine will have clear evidence when vehicles violate traffic laws or accidents occur. If the photos are sent to the authorities, they will accept them and warn or punish the violators.
