### Weng Wenhao Discusses the Recent Situation in Shaanxi

And New Executive Yuan Measures

[Nanjing] A reporter visited Executive Yuan Secretary-General Weng Wenhao on the 13th, inquiring about the recent situation in Xi'an regarding post-incident affairs, and the new political measures implemented by the Executive Yuan in recent years. He provided the following information. Mr. Weng first said that after the Xi'an Incident occurred, not only did Shaanxi and Gansu suffer heavy losses, but the general construction projects were also severely affected. Fortunately, it has been completely resolved. In addition to Chairman Sun Weiru's telegram to the Executive Yuan the other day indicating his intention to assume his new post, another memorial has arrived, reporting on the progress of provincial administration reform. The candidates for the heads of various departments of the provincial government are currently being selected and will be presented to the Executive Yuan for discussion and appointment in the next few days. In the past year, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, all departments have worked diligently. For example, the rapid expansion and progress of new railways is unprecedented since the Republic. Other examples include the establishment of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank to improve rice and wheat, the planning and construction of vegetable oil factories and steel factories, the expansion of long-distance telephones, the reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau, the increase of compulsory education funding, the establishment of county and municipal administrative training institutes, the implementation of the legal tender policy, and the implementation of income tax. For local administration, particular emphasis is placed on reorganizing security teams, implementing land registration, promoting bandit suppression in border areas, and proposing central construction projects. These have all been repeatedly ordered and urged, and either have been successfully implemented or are in progress. The best way to manage central and local administration is to have a periodic plan that specifically stipulates the work to be emphasized during a certain period, so that personnel can concentrate their efforts and actively manage it. For example, county magistrates often feel that there are too many central government orders and that local funds are insufficient to implement them. However, the most important aspect of local finance is land tax. Currently, most counties rely solely on extremely old registers as the basis for assessment, and some have even lost all of the old fish-scale registers, resulting in extremely unfair tax allocation. Poor landowners often bear a large amount of land tax and surcharges, while landowners with very large areas either do not pay tax or pay very little. The government should conduct a thorough investigation and implement land registration and measurement to ensure that the people bear the burden evenly, and increase revenue without adding taxes. There are already many successful examples of this work, and the provincial governments should formulate methods and implement them effectively. From this one example, it can be seen that it is necessary to have a definite plan for administration. (Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 13th)

[Nanjing] The Central Political Council held its 86th meeting at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 10th, chaired by Chairman Wang. After the meeting began, the chairman reported that the Standing Committee members of the Central Executive Committee, Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Zhaoming, Zou Lu, Ye Chucang, Feng Yuxiang, Kong Xiangxi, and Chen Lifu, had decided today to award a scholarship memorial fund of 200,000 yuan to National Government Chairman Lin Zichao, and presented a report. The scholarship fund regulations will be handled by the secretariat in consultation with Chairman Lin. The allocation procedures will be determined separately by the council. Routine cases were then discussed, with four cases referred to the specialized committees on internal affairs, legislation, and transportation for review, and eight budget estimates were approved. After the discussion, Chairman Lin rose and said that the 11th was the anniversary of his mother's death and that he had declined all celebrations. He had just heard that the Central Government was awarding a scholarship memorial fund, which he could not refuse out of respect, but felt ashamed to accept. However, he thought that the purpose of this measure was to encourage scholarship. Since the Central Government was doing this, it would be a memorial for his seventieth birthday, so he could not refuse and expressed his deep gratitude and embarrassment. All the committee members present believed that Chairman Lin was the head of state, and that the country should hold a celebration to express respect on the occasion of his birthday. At that time, some advocated for a one-day holiday, some advocated for hanging flags to celebrate, some advocated for going to his residence to congratulate him, and some advocated for group banquets. However, Chairman Lin repeatedly declined and politely thanked the people and his colleagues in the Central Government, asking them to understand his intentions and avoid making him uneasy. The committee members, deeply moved by Chairman Lin's sincere humility, decided that all birthday celebrations would be canceled. Chairman Lin then gladly left the meeting. (Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 10th)

[Nanjing] The 11th was National Government Chairman Lin's seventieth birthday, coinciding with the lunar New Year's Day. Out of respect for the head of state, the people and officials across the country, in addition to the birthday telegrams that arrived like snowflakes and the scholarship memorial fund respectfully awarded by the Central Government, various central figures and people from all walks of life in Nanjing went to the National Government and the chairman's private residence on the morning of the 11th to offer birthday congratulations, reaching several hundred people. Chairman Lin, having repeatedly declined all birthday celebrations at the Central Political Council meeting on the 10th, originally intended to leave Nanjing to avoid the birthday, but later felt that it would be inconvenient, so he decided to rest at his residence on the 11th. Therefore, all the dignitaries who went to his private residence on the 11th to offer birthday congratulations were politely declined by Chairman Lin's staff and only left their calling cards. Those who went to the National Government to offer birthday congratulations were received by Chief Aide-de-Camp Lu Chao, who recorded their names and then politely declined them. The three chiefs of the National Government, the Chief Secretary, the Chief Aide-de-Camp, and the Comptroller General, followed Chairman Lin's wishes and did not go to his residence to offer birthday congratulations on the 11th. Those who went to the government to offer birthday congratulations included Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, Zhang Jingjiang (represented by Zheng Lichuan), Zhu Peide, Wang Luyi, Dai Kuisheng, Chu Minyi, Hong Lanyou, Yang Jie, Qian Dajun, Wang Maogong, Ye Xiufeng, Di Ying, Niu Yongjian, Cheng Qian, Chen Diaoyuan, Zhang Qun, Chen Jie, Xu Mo, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Xunyong, Tao Lüqian, Wang Gupan, and representatives from various organizations, approximately one hundred people in total.

### Liu Jianxu Discusses Bandit Suppression Military Affairs

[Nanjing] Liu Jianxu, the Pacification Director of the Fujian-Zhejiang-Anhui-Jiangxi Border Region, stated that the bandits in the four-province border region are all remnants of Fang Zhimin's forces. They have been entrenched in the border areas of the four provinces for ten years. After successive suppressions by Luo Zhuoying, Jiang Dingwen, Zhang Fakui, etc., Fang Zhimin was arrested and executed. The bandits then fragmented into smaller groups, becoming elusive. I was ordered to assume my current position in December of last year. Due to the impact of the Xi'an Incident, I was unable to launch immediate suppression. I started the suppression on January 15th of this year, adopting a gradual approach. First, I rectified military discipline to achieve cooperation between the military and the people. Since the suppression began, the remaining bandit groups have been surrounded, and those who were coerced into joining have surrendered one after another. In the future, we will cooperate with the people, coordinate military and political affairs, and expect to completely eliminate them within six months. Investigations reveal that among the remaining bandits in the four provinces, those in the Zhejiang-Jiangxi-Anhui border region include Xu Yongjian and Yu Jinbiao, with approximately two to three hundred people and weapons, entrenched in Pan Cen at the border of Yiyang and Hengfeng. In the Wen-Chu area of Fujian and Zhejiang, there is Liu Ying's bandit gang, scattered between Fuding and Pingyang, which is about to be completely eliminated. A portion of the bandit gang is gathering in the Yanghuai Jiujiuwan area between Ningguo, Yin County, Tong'an, and Wuyuan. A telegram received on the 12th stated that they have been eliminated. In addition, there are two groups of bandits, Liu Dayun and Huang Dao, with approximately two hundred people each, gathering in Bilongyuan Kuijialing area in Longpu Songxi Suichang. They will soon be suppressed. (13th Special Telegram)

### National Treasury Allocates Funds to the Pension Board

To Prepare for Payment of Special Urgent Pension Cases

[Nanjing] The Central Political Council has resolved that after the central government ceases collecting income tax, the pension funds for party members and martyrs, originally paid from this tax revenue, will be paid from the National Treasury.

### The Formation of the Hayashi Cabinet

— Nan Yun

Army Department's command:

"Right face... turn!"

Those who disobey this command are punished: "Leftist" elements become "ideological offenders." If they don't show "reorientation," they will never breathe the air outside the window again. Those who are extremely "right-leaning" are also not allowed; the group of soldiers who launched the "February 26th" incident suffered greatly. Furthermore, those who don't turn enough when following the command to turn to the right are also unacceptable—Ugaki thought he was an army general and should qualify, but he ultimately couldn't take office.

Who doesn't know that a "right turn" should be ninety degrees? And everyone knows that:

The direction of advancement is — "Greater Japanism."

The route of advancement is — "Continental Policy."

However, since the "September 18th Incident," the Army Department has not found a Minister of War who turned appropriately.

Before the "September 18th Incident," Ugaki had served as Minister of War three times and Governor-General of Korea once. He only stepped down last August. Ugaki is a soldier and politician with "skill" and "talent," as all newspapers have recognized. But, "the son of a good doctor dies of illness," and Ugaki, who came from the army, failed due to the opposition of the army.

It is not that Ugaki refused to turn to the right, but that the Army Department felt that he couldn't turn to the correct degree. It's not that he didn't know the goal and route, but that they feared he wouldn't have the strong "control" when "starting to walk."

The current cabinet's mission is to complete the "quasi-wartime system." The "quasi-wartime system" includes: (1) Strengthening national defense, (2) Renewing general administration, (3) Purging the military.

Regarding the "purging the military" work, it has been almost completed after several "major army and navy shifts" last year. The "administrative reform plan" proposed by the military (the army takes the leading position) is the content of "renewing general administration." It is clear that the government demanded by the military is a "strengthened control" government. The parliament demanded by the military is a parliament that must not interfere with the government. At the same time, the government and parliament must respect "national defense firstism" and accept the expansion of military spending as a matter of course.

Ugaki forming a cabinet is an obstacle to achieving the "purging the military." The army had made such a statement of opposition.

If the military cannot be purged, the administration cannot be renewed; if the administration cannot be renewed, "national defense firstism" and even Greater Japanism cannot be realized—this is the Army Department's logic.

How to prove that Ugaki is an obstacle to achieving the "purging the military"? The army based its argument on Ugaki's history: As Minister of War in the Kiyoura Cabinet, Ugaki had reduced four divisions of the army; as Minister of War in the Kiyoura Cabinet, Ugaki had concluded the London Naval Treaty—what the Army Department called the "weak treaty."

Whether Ugaki still advocates military reduction today is irrelevant. In short, in this era when military expansion should be actively pursued, Ugaki must be absolutely rejected, so Ugaki failed.

The one who succeeded Ugaki in receiving the imperial mandate was also an army general—Hayashi Senjūrō.

General Hayashi's prestige became well-known during the "September 18th Incident." At that time, General Hayashi was the commander of the Korean Army. After the "September 18th Incident," General Hayashi led his troops across the Manchurian border without waiting for orders from his superiors. According to custom, General Hayashi should not have taken this free action without orders from his superiors. Therefore, after the "September 18th Incident," General Hayashi was called the Border-Crossing General. (See Reader's Digest, January 30th)

Secondly, the "February 26th Incident," in which young army officers attacked senior statesmen and elders, occurred during the period when General Hayashi was serving as Minister of War. General Hayashi retired because of this incident. What about now? Some of the young officers who initiated the "February 26th Incident" have been executed, some have committed suicide, and some have been imprisoned. Furthermore, after several "military purges" by War Minister Terauchi during the Hirota Cabinet, there shouldn't be much of a problem—at this time, General Hayashi came forward to form a cabinet.

The current army leadership has expressed its approval of General Hayashi forming a cabinet. However, while approving, it also expressed its "expectations" for General Hayashi. These "expectations" are: "To decisively implement national defense enhancement, military discipline correction, and the renewal of general administration."

To achieve the above goals, the following should be implemented immediately: (1) Most ministers hold multiple positions (in the "administrative reform plan" proposed by the military, there are opinions on merging agencies to strengthen control). (2) Partisans who have not broken away from established political parties are not allowed to enter the cabinet. (3) Dissolve the current parliament. (According to Reader's Digest)

Regarding these "expectations," General Hayashi must have already planned for them in terms of implementation, otherwise he wouldn't have come forward. With the courage of the "Border-Crossing General," it seems that he can realize this strong cabinet.

The Army Department has always been playing the leading role. Let's look at other aspects.

The most recent reason for the Hirota Cabinet's resignation was the conflict between War Minister Terauchi and Representative Hamada (a member of the Seiyūkai party), which generally speaking, was a conflict between the Army Department and parliament. But at the time, Navy Minister Nagano also played an important role—a role in mediating the compromise between the military and political parties. The Navy Minister's mediation essentially proved that the opinions of the army and navy leaders were inconsistent. The inconsistent opinions of the army and navy did not just begin recently. Let's not talk about the distant past: just look at the navy's "Southern Advance Theory" and the army's "Northern Advance Theory" in recent years to understand. But the "Northern Advance Theory" clearly has the advantage. The various facts since the "September 18th Incident" have proven this. Therefore, the current military is essentially led by the Army Department. However, the army can only achieve complete victory with the "cooperation" or "wait and see" attitude of the navy. When the army opposed Ugaki, the navy "waited and saw," and the army won. Today (January 30th), the army expressed support for the Hayashi Cabinet, and with the navy also in a "wait and see" attitude, the army will of course be able to win again. If the navy expresses the opposite opinion, it will not succeed. There are many such examples in Japanese history. But, the navy is "waiting and seeing," which is cautious and also leaves room for future expression.

The Minseitō party had expressed support for Ugaki, and the Seiyūkai party had also expressed a "wait and see" favor toward Ugaki, but when Ugaki was suffering from the army's opposition, they didn't have even the slightest action to support him. They watched Ugaki fall by the wayside. After Ugaki fell, both the Minseitō and Seiyūkai parties became even more fearful. The "established political parties" referred to by the Army Department are the Minseitō and Seiyūkai parties. Now, the Minseitō and Seiyūkai parties are facing the crisis of parliament dissolution. But they still dare not express an actively opposing attitude toward General Hayashi, who is responsible for the mission of dissolution. This is clearly an irreversible decline of constitutional government.

Capitalists and the press generally went through the motions of supporting Ugaki on the surface. The emerging Sumitomo Zaibatsu and Noguchi Zaibatsu had a particularly deep relationship with Ugaki. They had expressed particular support. But, the soaring military demand stocks fell in price, which was a fatal blow to Ugaki. In recent years, the Japanese economy has only been a ____ of the military demand industry. Only when the capitalists of the military demand industry secretly oppose, is it difficult for Ugaki to gain a foothold. What's more, the one directly boosting the military demand economy and frontally confronting Ugaki is the Army Department. Regarding General Hayashi's rise to power, the Mitsubishi Bank's opinion is: "The expansion of government spending and the strengthening of the controlled economy are inevitable..." The Mitsui Bank only expressed opinions on the selection of the Minister of Finance: "The Minister of Finance we hope for is someone with abundant financial and economic knowledge and who also understands all current situations." Mitsui and Mitsubishi are Japan's largest financial capitalists. Although the monopolistic opposition of Mitsui and Mitsubishi cannot be resolved, the goal of expanding resources and markets is the same. And the expansion and monopolization of the market cannot do without military force, so, of course, they must support the Hayashi Cabinet, although the degree of support is different.

After the Hayashi Cabinet appeared, the fascist color of Japanese politics became more pronounced—this is a unanimous observation from all sides.

Groups with a stronger fascist color, such as the Meirin Association, had encouraged the military to oppose Ugaki, and now, of course, they will encourage General Hayashi.

In short, in this stage of financial capital vying for "monopoly," the middle class is panicking, and the burden on the working masses is heavier. Established political parties are disintegrating, fascist parties are rising, and liberal constitutionalism is declining. At the same time, the international war crisis is deepening.

"General Hayashi's cabinet formation policy... is based on the army's innovative thinking... from the perspective of implementing the continental policy..." This is what it said on the Reader's Digest News, especially excerpted in order to ____ this article in ____ month 20th.

### Discussion of the Joint Examination Problem

— Wu Shichang

In recent years, Chinese education at the secondary level and above has made significant progress. Although it is still far from our ideal standards, it is distinctly different from the restless and perfunctory situation before the 20th year of the Republic [1931]. The increase in the number of educated people, the enrichment of facilities in various schools, the serious responsibility of government authorities at all levels in charge of education, and the progress of various academic researches have all brought us a little comfort amidst this precarious and turbulent national crisis. However, there are still many areas where we feel that immediate improvement is necessary. Now, let's first talk about the issue of joint examinations.

The joint examination is a major event that educational authorities in various provinces have been most serious about and have strived to hold in the past four or five years. However, it has always been limited to middle schools and has not extended to universities, which makes us feel that there is a need for discussion. The benefits of the middle school joint examination are obvious to most people: it can standardize the level of middle schools and encourage middle school teachers and students to teach and study seriously. (I say "standardize" instead of "improve" because middle school textbooks have a fixed standard, and the joint examination questions cannot exceed the textbooks.) However, few people pay attention to the drawbacks it causes. As far as we know, there are at least the following: First, most (perhaps all) schools, in order to compete for rankings in the joint examination results, simply do not teach formal subjects in the second semester of the third year of junior and senior high school. Instead, they focus on teaching students various test questions and various test-taking techniques, abandoning serious academic studies. This is tantamount to giving the entire middle school education an 84% discount. As for the isolation from extracurricular reading and the lack of general knowledge training, these phenomena existed long before the second semester of the third year. Second, many schools with lower levels and poorer teachers have to use various unreasonable methods to force students to study by rote, doing test questions repeatedly every day, and even abolishing holidays and opening night classes, which has a great impact on the health of young people. Schools with good levels also have this situation in order to compete for rankings. A good example is a certain middle school that ranked first in the Jiangsu provincial joint examination in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934] and was attacked by local people for not paying enough attention to students' health. Third, many middle schools, fearing that the average score of the entire class in the joint examination would be low, conceal and do not report some students with lower grades when submitting the joint examination report, depriving them of the opportunity to further their studies forever. The student dispute with the school at Huibei Middle School in Peiping [Beijing] last summer arose because of this. As for whether it is reasonable for a high school graduate to go through a triple jump of graduation examination, joint examination, and university entrance examination in one summer, it is also a question worth considering. All of this was probably not considered by those who initially advocated the middle school joint examination system.

The pros and cons of the middle school joint examination system need to be measured by a very accurate investigation in order to decide whether to reform or abolish this system in the future. However, from a general point of view, the middle school joint examination is far less urgent and necessary than the university joint examination. Middle school students do not need to and do not have to enter university, so general physical and mental training and the acquisition of broad knowledge in life are much more important than repeated exercises of test questions. Middle school courses often take more than 30 hours per week. One hour of class requires two hours of preparation and homework, plus military training, memorial weeks, etc. If there are not 25 hours in a day, how can they have the time to acquire broad knowledge, develop reading habits, and how can it not affect their developing physical and mental health? Secondly, middle school teaching materials are relatively standardized. As long as teachers teach seriously, the level difference will not be too great. Unlike some academic fields in universities, teaching entirely relies on the results of professors' research, and the level can vary greatly, requiring a higher standard for comparison. Therefore, whether middle schools need joint examinations is open to discussion, while university joint examinations appear to be more essential in various aspects. However, to discuss the pros and cons of university joint examinations, we must first briefly explain the methods of this system in order to have a basis. We now tentatively propose the following specific plans:

㊀ The graduation examinations of all universities in the country shall be presided over by the state. Only those who pass the national examination shall be awarded degrees.

㊁ This examination may be presided over by an expert committee composed of professors from various universities and senior scholars in the academic community appointed by the Ministry of Education. Under this committee, several subcommittees shall be formed for different subjects (such as the physics subcommittee, the history subcommittee, etc.). The subcommittees shall draft test questions and send them to the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education shall select the questions and secretly distribute them to various universities for candidates to take the test. The test shall be held on the same day nationwide, and administrative personnel from each university shall invigilate the test. The test papers shall be submitted to the Ministry of Education and forwarded to various committee members for evaluation. Those who pass shall be awarded degrees by the Ministry of Education; otherwise, they shall not be allowed to call themselves graduates of a certain university or "× Bachelor."

㊂ Any student who has studied for more than three years at a national or registered private university may take the examination. To encourage poor scholars, non-university students who have written works and have made definite contributions to academics may also take the examination with the approval of more than a certain number of specialized committee members. (For science and engineering students with experiments, the restrictions may be slightly stricter.)

㊃ The examination courses for each department shall cover the main courses of the department, at least ten or fifteen or more. One subject may be tested for one or two days. The time may be extended to about one month for rest and preparation. Students who fail this year may take the examination again next year.

㊄ The list of candidates shall be submitted to the Ministry of Education by each school in advance. Individual candidates shall register with the local education bureau and submit the list to the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education shall issue assigned numbers. The test papers shall use numbers instead of names of students or schools. There are still many unreasonable situations in university education in various places. However, if we want to reform, it is often very difficult due to various problems such as political situation, factions, systems, and personnel: this is undeniable. I believe that the implementation of this system is the simplest, fairest, and most effective method to solve the above-mentioned difficulties. At the same time, there are many other benefits, which are briefly described below:

First, the level of all universities in the country can be improved consistently. The levels of various universities today differ greatly, especially in the fields of arts and law. The lack of objective standards makes it easy to be corrupt and perfunctory, which is criticized by people. It is better for the Ministry of Education to hold joint examinations than to restrict enrollment, because the former damages students' interests and obliterates factual needs, while the latter is the best way to improve and standardize the level. If this system is implemented, the materials tested by students nationwide will be consistent, and universities everywhere will immediately have three direct demands: ㊀ The courses of various universities must meet the standards set by the expert committee, only more, not less: at the same time, courses that are perfunctory, ridiculous, used to collect credits, and muddled through will naturally be eliminated, and personnel problems will also be solved accordingly. ㊁ The content of basic courses must be enriched to meet the joint examination requirements. In this way, not only students but also old professors will be forced to work hard together. ㊂ Various universities must clarify the departments. Novel and ridiculous departments will naturally be abolished, and mixed departments cannot but be rectified clearly.

Second, the economy of university administration and expenses. If this system is implemented, students will have to seek practical knowledge to take the examination. All other reputations are of no benefit to them. Schools and students will have to strive for practicality and tension to increase efficiency. Universities that are neither fish nor fowl will naturally be eliminated, which can save society a lot of waste.

Third, cultivate a free research atmosphere. At this moment, only children from middle-class families or above in China have the opportunity to pursue advanced academics, which is an extremely unreasonable thing. Individuals who do not enter university can freely study in public libraries and can take the academic examination based on their writings, which is the only possible way to remedy this phenomenon. Also, those who were middle school and university students in the past and are employed in various places can also be encouraged to devote themselves to academics in their spare time to prepare for the examination.

Fourth, help solve the social unemployment problem. At present, university student unemployment is the most serious phenomenon in society, and many social unrests arise because of this. Moreover, the problem is not only unemployment. Many university students can only work as clerks, or cannot even be qualified as clerks, and thus resent the unfairness of society. If joint examinations are implemented, so that they know their position compared to the national standard even though they are university students, they can also be dedicated and diligent in lower positions, so that not everyone has a sense of being unappreciated and increases social unrest. At the same time, people with real talent can also receive fair treatment and will not be hindered by factional systems in the cultivation of talent.

Five years ago, I once discussed the issue of reforming higher education with Mr. Fu Mengzhen, and I also mentioned this issue (Independent Review, No. 17). At that time, we hoped that this ideal might be realized in three to five years. If the Ministry of Education can start preparations at this time, we hope that it can be piloted this summer. As for the detailed plan, it must be carefully studied. This article is just a suggestion. February 9, 26th year of the Republic [1937], Lugia Mountain, Wuchang.

### British Chancellor of the Exchequer Announces Plan to Raise Huge Sum to Strengthen National Defense

Raising £400 Million in Bonds within Five Years　White Paper to Be Released on Tuesday　No Less Than a Warning to Germany

[London] In response to questions from Labor Member of Parliament Attlee in the House of Commons today, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain stated that the government will raise £400 million in bonds within the next five years to strengthen British national defense. According to Chamberlain, the government intends to immediately submit a bill to Parliament to increase assets or utilize the surplus in the budget to meet national defense needs. The raised debt is planned to be repaid in installments over 30 years. Chamberlain also declared that, based on the experience of the past year, the urgency of our arduous work has not been reduced in the slightest, and our burden of strengthening national defense to the planned level has not been lightened in the slightest. The increase in British national defense expenditure is extremely rapid, and it cannot be fully met with annual revenue. The amount required now and the years of allocation cannot be predicted at this time, but the total amount of the debt will not exceed £400 million. The necessary financial decisions will be submitted to Parliament in a white paper by the government. Chamberlain also advocated that the expenditure of this debt should be managed by the Treasury and not directly by the national defense agencies, and that all national defense expenditure should be approved by Parliament. (Central News Agency, London, Reuters dispatch, 11th)

[London] The proposal to allow the Ministry of Finance to raise bonds or use the budget surplus to fund national defense expenditure, the amount of which shall not exceed £400 million and shall be raised over five years, announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the House of Commons last night, will be submitted to Parliament as soon as possible. The bill may be introduced in the House of Commons on Thursday and will be debated after the members have fully studied the white paper to be released by the government on February 16. The white paper will contain information on the progress of the government's various national defense programs and will roughly contain some plans for the coming year, as well as explaining the urgency of the government having the right to raise £400 million. The content of the bill announced last night is that the bonds raised for national defense purposes will pay interest at 3%, and after the five-year period expires, the principal and interest will be repaid over 30 years. The Times commented on the government's proposal, saying that the government's new debt of £400 million has no problem of being thrown on the market, nor is there any sign of an immediate subscription. The money will be borrowed over five years, and when needed, the Ministry of Finance will issue a type of security based on already or to be raised public bonds. The new borrowing is not £400 million as its total amount, but £400 million as its highest limit. To exceed this limit, new legislation must be enacted. Technically speaking, what the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced yesterday was nothing more than the establishment of an institution for capable financial management, the details of which will be determined by Parliament according to the needs of future circumstances. The British government's determination and ability to implement national defense programs are further demonstrated by this. The various efforts of the government departments to consolidate national defense at the same time can be relied upon with greater confidence, and the harmful policy of exhausting all resources and wasting huge sums to expand armaments throughout the world may also be deterred by this. We have great expectations for this, and so on. (Central News Agency, London, Reuters dispatch, 12th)

[London] Diplomatic circles today felt that German Ambassador to the United Kingdom Ribbentrop visited Acting Foreign Secretary Sir Halifax twenty minutes after Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain announced the plan to raise national defense bonds in the House of Commons. It is a question of whether it was predetermined or a coincidence. Officials denied any relationship between the two, but it is generally believed that this gesture aims to warn Germany that Britain will soon be the country with the most complete defense capabilities. Financial authorities estimate that Britain will spend £900 million to overhaul its armaments and maintain its fighting power within five years. (12th National Telegram)

### British Expansion Plan Emphasizes Air Defense

Army to Be Mechanized

[London] Responsible sources recently announced that after Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain announced yesterday that the government would issue £400 million in national defense bonds, a large-scale reform plan in military affairs would follow. The detailed plan will be announced in the form of a white paper on the 16th of this month. The main points are as follows: ㊀ Increase the amount of military pay and bonuses so that people can enthusiastically enlist when the regular army is recruited. Improve the training system for those responsible for the air defense of the mainland territory. ㊁ Most troops will implement large-scale mechanization. According to British authorities, the idea of dispatching troops to the European continent to participate in future wars seems to have been temporarily abandoned, and the focus is on the organization of the mainland defense, and it is believed that the mainland defense is mainly in the air force. Therefore, the plan to reorganize the armaments also focuses on the air force the most. It can be clearly seen from the current plan being carried out this year that it stipulates the addition of several squadrons of aircraft and the construction of several airfields. (12th Havas dispatch)

### Berlin Shocked

[Berlin] After British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons yesterday, announcing the issuance of £400 million in national defense bonds, people here were generally shocked. All newspapers published this news on the front page, and deeply regarded "Britain's adoption of such an unprecedented armament expansion policy in peacetime as unusual." However, it was believed that after the Washington Naval Treaty expired at the end of last year, Britain had new responsibilities in the Pacific, and the country had to expand its armaments. The German General News Report listed the defense works recently built by the government of the British Empire in the country, Gibraltar, Alexandria, Cyprus, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand, and quoted General Weygand, the former Chief of Staff of the French Army, as saying, "A great power must have a strong army in order to meet the needs of its policies." What kind of policy does Britain want to adopt with this strong army? Since last December, Britain has been working closely with France, and the two countries' general staffs are conducting talks, which is indeed doubtful. In short, Germany is not responsible for this decision by Britain. As for the news carried by American newspapers that British officials fear the threat of Germany and Japan more than the threat of the Soviet Union, it is even more incredible. In addition, the local Guidance Report believes that this decision by Britain further proves the legitimacy of Germany's reorganization of armaments. (12th Havas dispatch)

### German Colonial Demands

German Ambassador Visits British Foreign Office to Explain Reasons　As Preliminary Preparation for Future Negotiations

[Berlin] German Ambassador to the United Kingdom General Ribbentrop visited Acting Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax at the British Foreign Office yesterday, and it was reported that it was related to the recovery of Germany's former colonies. The German ambassador asked the British government to consider recognizing Germany's demands in principle. British officials now regard this action by the German ambassador as the first formal step towards the biggest goal of the National Socialist Party, which is to recognize the full return of the land ruled by Germany in 1914. It is generally believed that this issue may not be easily resolved in a short period of time. It was also reported that the German ambassador did not submit any memorandum. (Central News Agency, London, Reuters dispatch, 12th)

### A Glimpse of the Content of the Talk

[London] German Ambassador Ribbentrop visited Acting Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax at the Foreign Office at 4:00 PM today. The talk did not end until 6:12 PM. When entering and leaving, he saluted in the style of the National Socialist Party. Regarding the content of the talk, officials only said, "The two discussed many issues, and Ribbentrop stated the views of the German government." It is generally believed that the content of the talk was kept confidential at Ribbentrop's request. Informed sources said that Ribbentrop explained the reasons for Germany's aspirations regarding the colonial issue and refuted the British objections one by one, but did not make any specific demands. It is likely that he will submit them after Foreign Secretary Eden returns from vacation. It is rumored that Lord Halifax's attitude is more favorable to Germany, and Germany intends to use Halifax to oppose Eden. Germany wants to prove that this is not true, so it does not intend to make specific demands for the time being. Ribbentrop first explained today that whether Germany has colonies is of great economic significance. Secondly, he stated that if Germany had colonies in Africa, it would not pose any threat to the British Empire, and claimed that the moral arguments contained in the Treaty of Versailles, which were used to deprive Germany of its colonies, were of no value. It is heard that Lord Halifax has learned that Germany's desire to recover its old colonies in terms of territory is hopeless, but it is possible to discuss obtaining some rights in economic terms.

In addition, Ribbentrop explained Germany's foreign policy:

㊀ Regarding the mutual assistance treaty between France and Russia, Ribbentrop stated that Germany still objects to it, and said that the two signatory countries retain the right to designate the aggressor, which contradicts Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. The reason why Germany is hesitant to participate in the disarmament convention or the sky convention is also because of this.

㊁ Regarding the issue of Central Europe, especially the issue of German minorities in the Czech Republic, the Free City of Danzig, and the Memel Territory, Ribbentrop explained that if these minorities can obtain a position that can make Germany feel satisfied, and Germany monitors the implementation of this system, then Germany is very willing to resolve peacefully and does not intend to use this as an excuse for enlightenment.

㊂ Regarding Germany's four-year economic plan, Ribbentrop explained that this plan does not mean that Germany is economically isolated. Its focus is on the supply of raw materials, such as oil, cotton, and rubber. Germany is not opposed to economic international cooperation, but the economic cooperation methods proposed by various countries so far are either vague or have the form of usurious loans, which Germany cannot accept. From Germany's observation, if the current import tax rates of various countries can be reduced, it will be of great benefit to economic cooperation, but this is still difficult to implement. As far as it is generally known, Lord Halifax did not speak much during today's talk and asked few questions, but only listened to Ribbentrop's opinions and promised to convey them to the cabinet. As for the progress of the talk, it can be summed up in one sentence, that is, Ribbentrop explained Germany's views as preliminary preparation for long-term negotiations in the future.

### Close Cooperation Between Britain and France Cannot Be Separated by Germany

[Paris] Regarding the situation of the talks between German Ambassador to the United Kingdom Ribbentrop and British Acting Foreign Secretary Halifax, the British government has notified the French government. People in the government here recently commented that the mutual cooperation between Britain and France is of great benefit to the international peace cause based on the League of Nations. If German foreign policy aims to separate Britain and France and prevent them from continuing to cooperate, it will definitely not succeed, because the governments of Britain and France have already decided to consult each other before adopting any resolutions. Political figures also said that the governments of Britain and France have jointly decided to continue to expand their armaments, which is not only sufficient to protect the security of each country, but also a strong guarantee for the current borders of Central Europe and Eastern Europe. As for the matter of Germany's request to restore its old colonies, political figures here generally believe that Britain and France have no intention of ceding any colonies to Germany in Africa or elsewhere. For example, Senator Lange, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, published an article in the Economic and Financial Communications Newspaper, stating briefly, "If Germany expects to succeed in what it failed in 1914, and even does not hesitate to resort to force, then all democratic countries will definitely unite with arms to maintain peace, as they did in the European War. Germany must understand this." (13th Havas dispatch)

### Reply to the British Note on the Locarno Issue

Willing to Protect the Security of Its Own Territory　Not Obligated to Assist Other Countries

Brussels According to the meaning contained in Belgium's reply to Britain's November 4 Locarno note, Belgium is not yet willing to promise France any assistance if France is attacked by Germany, and therefore still wants to maintain the neutral attitude previously announced by Belgian King Leopold. In any new Locarno Treaty, Belgium only wants its own security to be guaranteed and does not want to assume the responsibility of guaranteeing the security of other countries, because Belgium has done its duty if it can protect the security of its own borders.

### Japanese Diet Reconvenes Tomorrow, Government's Difficulties Can Be Overcome

Seeking the Complete Establishment of the Budget Plan　Political Parties Decide to Adopt a Self-Respecting Attitude

[Tokyo] The concrete plan for the revision of the next year's budget and tax increase is the central issue for the government's preparation for the Diet. It has now been finalized. The cabinet meeting on the 13th also formally decided on the Prime Minister's policy and diplomatic speech, the Finance Minister's financial speech, and at the same time prepared other administrative preparations to face the Diet that will reconvene on the 15th. However, this session has been suspended due to the coup, and there are only 39 days left in the session. It is also the first Diet of the Hayashi Cabinet, so the temporary and expedient budget plan and the temporary tax increase plan aimed at addressing the next year's revenue will inevitably be debated from both procedural and substantive aspects. The government is fully vigilant in case of emergency, and takes the establishment of the budget as the first priority, avoids friction with political parties, and takes full coordination as its policy, hoping to overcome the difficulties smoothly. On the one hand, the two parties, Seiyukai and Minseito, will hold a meeting of executive committee members and general meeting of members on the 14th to formally express the party's attitude. Although there are various reactions within the two parties, the general trend has been decided to exercise self-restraint, so it is unlikely that they will adopt a challenging attitude towards the Hirota Cabinet. Since the attitude of the government and political parties is stable and self-restrained, the Diet on the 15th should not cause a storm. However, how the debate surrounding the two proposals of tax increase and budget and the criticism of Prime Minister Hayashi's trust in political parties will develop is worth noting, because the general concern is focused on this.

### Budget Cut by More Than 200 Million Yuan

[Tokyo] The budget for the Showa 12th year, decided on the 12th at the Cabinet meeting, was reduced by 269 million yen from the 3.038 billion yen proposed by the previous cabinet, becoming 2.769 billion yen. The details are listed separately below (in units of 10,000 yen): Imperial Household Expenses 45, Ministry of Foreign Affairs 330, Ministry of Home Affairs 2,610, Ministry of Finance 5,450, Ministry of the Army 7,040, Ministry of the Navy 6,580, Ministry of Justice 420, Ministry of Education 1,450, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 1,150, Ministry of Commerce and Industry 260, Ministry of Communications 2,080, Ministry of Colonial Affairs 230, Total 27,694. (12th, Dōmei News Agency)

[Tokyo] The government, at yesterday's Cabinet meeting, decided that the amount to be suspended in next year's budget is 269 million yen. However, of this suspended amount, 46 million yen related to the Army and Navy will be handled only as a matter of understanding within the government. When submitting the budget to the Diet, both the Army and Navy budgets will be submitted with the expenditure budget decided by the previous cabinet, without any amendments, requesting approval. However, how the budgets of each ministry other than the Army and Navy will be formally handled remains to be thoroughly studied in the future. This kind of budget handling is unprecedented, and there will definitely be considerable debate in the Diet. (13th, Dōmei News Agency)

[Tokyo] The revised tax increase plan is estimated to increase total tax revenue by approximately 290 million yen. The details are as follows: domestic national debt approximately 268 million yen, customs duties 18 million yen, export control tax 4 million yen. Judging from the above situation, the customs duties increased by the Baba proposal amount to approximately 460 million yen. Compared to this, it is estimated that 170 million yen has been reduced.

### General Sugiyama Succeeds as Army Minister

[Tokyo] Lieutenant General Kōtarō Nakamura, the Army Minister, resigned due to illness, and former Army Minister Terauchi was appointed as the Inspector General of Education. The Army believes that Sugiyama's appointment as Army Minister is appropriate and suitable, and the entire Army supports it. The Hayashi Cabinet, which was once on the verge of collapse due to the Army's recommendation problem, will undergo a major change in its relationship with the Army due to the appointment of Army Minister Sugiyama. In this sense, the change of Army Minister can make the relationship between the Hayashi Cabinet and the Army even closer. As a result, it is tantamount to strengthening the Hayashi Cabinet. Conversely, the Army's wishes can be made clearer and more powerful through the new Army Minister. The Hayashi Cabinet's reform policies will be further promoted as a result. (10th, Dōmei News Agency)

### Goebbels' Speech Against Communism

Refusing the Westward Spread of Red Power, Recognizing the Impossibility of a European War

[Berlin] Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered an important political speech today at the "German Hall" to 20,000 members of the National Socialist Party, stating briefly, "Our enemies once falsely claimed that once we seized power, French troops would once again be stationed in the Rhineland region, but this statement ultimately did not become a reality. I also dare to say that France no longer has the idea of occupying the Ruhr mining area again. Since we have been in power, we have completed the reorganization of military preparations and torn up the Treaty of Versailles into pieces, throwing it in the face of the enemy to prove its absurdity." Regarding the Spanish problem, he said, "Bolshevism wants to implement its strategy in Western Europe and Spain, which we will never allow." Goebbels then described Germany's relations with Japan and the Balkan countries, and attacked the Roman Catholic Church, saying, "As far as I know, the Red government of Valencia in Spain has a representative stationed in the Vatican, while the National Government led by General Franco does not. This is quite thought-provoking... What position does the Christian Church occupy in the anti-Bolshevik struggle?" He then discussed war rumors, saying, "War will not break out. Führer Hitler has shaken hands with the French nation. We have no territorial demands on France." Finally, regarding the Moroccan issue, he said that all kinds of news (referring to news of German activities in Spanish Morocco) were issued by Moscow "and spread by newspapers in Paris. We should immediately counterattack to prove its falsity. In short, Moscow intends to plunge Europe into chaos, which we must prevent. This is what we can clearly state," he said.

### Portuguese Government Rejects Inspection Plan

The Work of the Adjustment Committee Encounters Serious Difficulties Again

[London] The Subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee for the Non-Intervention Plan in the Spanish Civil War continued to meet at the Foreign Office at 11:00 AM today. In addition to the British, French, German, Italian, Russian, and Portuguese ambassadors to the UK, military and naval experts from each country also attended. The Portuguese representative had already refused to accept the Spanish land inspection plan because it involved the Portuguese border. According to sources familiar with the matter, the Portuguese representative this morning also refused to accept the sea inspection plan because it involved Portuguese ports. Therefore, the ambassadors and military and naval experts of all countries believe that the efforts of the Adjustment Committee have encountered serious difficulties. (12th, Havas News Agency)

[London] Since the Portuguese government has refused to accept both the Spanish land and sea inspection plans, the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee currently has only two options: one is to admit that the inspection system cannot be implemented and abandon it, and the other is to decide to implement inspection in the high seas outside the territorial waters of Spain and Portugal to avoid conducting inspections within Portuguese territory and territorial waters. However, the second method equates Spain and Portugal, which is bound to encounter various obstacles that cannot be overcome. (12th, Havas News Agency)

### The Spanish Civil War Has Reached a Critical Stage

Both Sides Fight for the Avenue to the New Capital, Government Forces in Southern Capital Win Counterattack

The Spanish Civil War has now entered its seventh month. The port of Málaga in the south was occupied by rebel forces on the 8th of this month. The gain or loss of this port is of strategic importance, as the rebel forces can disrupt transportation to Valencia and Alicante, cut off supplies to the government forces from the Atlantic, and allow for free and unhindered communication between the mainland and Morocco.

Madrid: The avenue to Valencia is the lifeline of the capital. The two sides are attacking each other 12 miles southeast of the capital to fight for control of this road. Therefore, the Spanish Civil War has now reached a critical stage. The focus of the battle is currently on the Jarama River. Both sides have densely deployed various mechanized units on both sides of the river. The Spanish government insists that government forces have recaptured the small mountains overlooking the road, so the road is not yet free from the bombardment of Nationalist artillery, but machine guns cannot reach it. The government also admits that both sides suffered heavy losses in this battle, mostly due to the use of mechanized tactics. The Nationalist headquarters in Salamanca claims that Nationalist forces on the Madrid front buried 1,800 enemy corpses this week. It also claims that Nationalist cavalry still occupies several miles of the Valencia Avenue. Government forces launched a counterattack yesterday with 27 tanks, hoping to prevent Nationalist forces from consolidating their positions on the right bank of the Jarama, but were driven back by Nationalist forces. (13th, Reuters, Central News Agency)

Madrid: The Defense Committee issued a statement today stating that government forces have been launching a counterattack in the Jarama River area south of the capital for the past 24 hours, repelling Moroccan cavalry belonging to the rebel forces and mechanized units composed of Germans, and recovering many important strategic locations in the highlands near Valencia Avenue and the Bahlales Mountains. In addition, rebel forces on the northeastern front of Guadarajara also launched a fierce attack but were defeated head-on by government forces, with rebel casualties reaching as many as 250. (13th, Havas News Agency)

Madrid: Although the Spanish Nationalist forces claim that they will wage a final battle to seize Madrid, the Spanish government forces are now preparing a major counterattack to repel the Nationalist forces advancing on the capital. The Madrid garrison has called for a general mobilization and stated that the loss of Málaga should not discourage the fighting spirit of the government forces. Government forces say they still control the avenue from Madrid to Valencia, but vehicles must detour because the road has been threatened by enemy artillery. Life in local villages and towns remains as usual. Women are sitting outdoors today, breathing fresh air, and young girls smile carefree as they go to the wells to fetch water. However, the rumble of artillery is incessant, mixed with the laughter of women. The tranquility of life in this area is evident. (13th, Reuters, Central News Agency)

Hendaye: It was learned today that General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, has withdrawn 30,000 troops from Málaga. Some have been transferred to Córdoba to prevent government forces from launching an offensive, and some have been transferred to the Madrid front to prepare for a new offensive. According to government forces' news received from the border, the Nationalist forces in Córdoba are currently in a dangerous situation. Government forces now occupy Algory, which is only five miles from Córdoba. Government forces in the Sierra Nevada region are also mobilizing, preparing to impede the advance of General Ranno's troops. (12th, Guomin News)

Ávila: Several aircraft belonging to the Nationalist forces circled over the city of Madrid today but did not drop bombs. The Nationalist forces also occupied new positions along the Valencia Avenue and reinforced their defenses. As for the Málaga province in the south, the Nationalist forces are now advancing towards the port of Almería and are expected to reach the port soon. Refugees are flocking to the port. The normal population of only 50,000 has increased to 200,000 in a matter of days. In addition, on the front lines near Madrid, government soldiers have been killed in large numbers, and 1,800 corpses have been buried in recent days. (13th, Havas News Agency)

To Visit the United States to Express Goodwill

[Washington] Authorities announced today that a Dutch submarine fleet is scheduled to arrive here on Monday for a goodwill visit. This is an innovation for the Netherlands, and the common political and naval relationship between the Netherlands and the United States has suddenly attracted attention, especially the relationship between the two countries in the Pacific. It is said that this visit is in return for the recent visit of the American fleet to the Dutch East Indies. Naval officials are very pleased with this. (12th, Guomin News)

### US Army to Build Defense Project in San Francisco

[San Francisco] It was learned today that the authorities will soon begin requisitioning 800 acres of land near Battery Point north of the Golden Gate, so that the Army can build harbor defense projects. The project includes barracks facilities, defense gun emplacements, and railways. (13th, Guomin News)

### US Shipbuilding Program Comes to a Standstill

Due to a Severe Shortage of Steel

[Washington] It was learned today that the construction of six new destroyers and three new submarines, which account for half of the US's shipbuilding program this year, has come to a standstill due to a severe shortage of steel. The steel shortage is due to a dispute between the US government and industrialists. It is reported that copper and steel manufacturers have stopped supplying the Navy Department with the steel it needs in order to oppose the Walsh-Healey Act, which stipulates a 40-hour work week and sets certain labor treatment regulations for factories that meet government needs. When steel mills worked 48 hours a week, the output was not enough to meet demand, so they all refused to reduce the weekly working hours to 40 hours just for the sake of supplying government orders, because government orders are a very small number compared to those placed by private individuals. It is reported that the Navy Department currently needs at least 25 million pounds of steel, but the steel mills have no intention of accepting government orders. If the Navy Department builds one or two 35,000-ton battleships, the amount of steel needed will be even greater. (12th, Reuters, Central News Agency)

### Balkan Four-Nation Political Conference

To Be Held in Athens Soon, Romanian Foreign Minister Explains Diplomatic Strategy

Athens: The Standing Political Conference of the Balkan Entente countries will be held here soon. Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu set off today for the capital of Yugoslavia, Belgrade, to meet with Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović. They will then travel together to the Greek port of Thessaloniki, where they will meet with Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü and come to the capital together. The Greek government has now sent representatives to the border to welcome the foreign ministers of the three countries. In addition, the Balkan Entente countries' press conference will also be held here at the same time. (13th, Havas News Agency)

Romanian Capital: Foreign Minister Antonescu gave a speech in the Senate last night, stating briefly that since King Carol of Romania visited the capital of Czechoslovakia, the alliance between Romania and Czechoslovakia has become stronger. Since Foreign Minister Antonescu traveled to Poland, the alliance between Romania and Poland has become closer. When he visited Paris, French Foreign Minister Delbos also repeatedly assured that the friendship between France and Romania would never be interrupted. In addition, Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović has visited Romania several times, which is enough to prove the close ties between Romania and Yugoslavia. As for Romania's relationship with the Soviet Union, it has always been very good and continues to develop in an atmosphere of genuine friendship. Even if there are occasional small incidents, they are not enough to hinder the relationship between the two countries. Is there any reason to say that Romania's understanding with the Soviet Union has been threatened? Finally, the Foreign Minister strongly stated that the government will continue to pursue Romania's traditional diplomatic policy. (13th, Havas News Agency)

### Huitong Company, Which Manages Sino-Japanese Air Transportation, Actively Expands

Tianjin-Tokyo Joint Flights to Be Realized on March 1st, New Tianjin-Harbin Route Planned with Daily Flights, Japanese Military Aircraft Still Constantly Traveling Back and Forth in Hebei and Chahar

Tianjin Correspondence: Huitong Airlines, which manages Sino-Japanese air transportation in Hebei and Chahar, has a capital of 5.4 million yuan, with China and Japan each contributing half. Currently, only 1.35 million yuan has been collected. When the Japanese side initially proposed to the Hebei-Chahar authorities to jointly establish Huitong Company, it was agreed that after the air transportation was opened, Japanese military aircraft would no longer fly in Hebei and Chahar. However, after Huitong Company opened for business, the Japanese side went back on its word. The military aircraft are still constantly traveling back and forth in the skies of Hebei and Chahar. The Hebei-Chahar Foreign Affairs Committee has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side, but without success. Therefore, Zhang Yunrong, who was in charge of preparing for Sino-Japanese air transportation on the Chinese side, resigned as chairman of Huitong Company. Zhang Zizhong, the successor chairman, has taken office, but has not officially started work. The company is nominally a Sino-Japanese joint venture, but the actual power is in the hands of Vice Chairman Tsuneo Kodama (Japanese). All routine matters are fully controlled by the General Affairs Section Chief Higuchi (Japanese). The Japanese side has recently proposed to the Hebei-Chahar authorities to increase capital in order to expand. The Chinese side is studying and considering this and has not yet agreed.

The company's recent plans also include the decision to open a Tianjin-Harbin route to facilitate the travel of Japanese military personnel in and out of customs. Because Harbin is under the jurisdiction of Manchukuo, the Japanese side plans to have Daito Company come forward to undertake the project. Tsuneo Kodama, Vice Chairman of Huitong Company, went to Changchun last month to discuss everything with the heads of the Japanese Kwantung Army for this matter. The principles have been largely decided. It is planned to have one flight per day initially, with a fare of about 90 yuan. After the route opens, new eight-seat AB-type large aircraft ordered from the Nakajima factory in Japan will be used for flights, with stops at Shanhaiguan, Jinzhou, Changchun, and three other stations. One of the three new aircraft ordered has already arrived in Hankou.

It is found that of the four routes currently operated by the company, only the Tianjin-Dalian route is occasionally taken by Chinese people. The rest are only used by Japanese soldiers. However, the company has recently handled Tianjin-Dalian and Dalian-Tokyo joint flights. All procedures have been prepared. Currently, it takes about two hours to fly from Tianjin to Dalian and a total of four hours from Dalian to Tokyo. If the joint flights are successful, it will be possible to arrive from Tianjin to Tokyo in the evening after departing in the morning. According to Yao Zuoshi, head of the business section of the company, the Tianjin-Dalian and Dalian-Tokyo joint flights can be implemented on March 1st if there are no special problems. As for the matter of transporting mail and packages by plane in and out of customs, there is only a proposal, as the problem is complex and must first be negotiated by the Chinese and Japanese authorities. It will not be easy to achieve in the near future.

According to Huitong Company's internal organization, there is originally a training section. After negotiations between the Japanese and Chinese sides, it was agreed that after the official opening of business, an aviation pilot training class would be organized to recruit and train students, regardless of Japanese or Chinese nationality, in order to cultivate talent. However, this has been delayed and delayed, and the aviation training class has not yet been organized. It has recently been decided to suspend it, as the organization of the training class was never the original intention of the Japanese side, but only a pretext for facilitating negotiations. In addition, for publicity purposes, the company is planning sightseeing flights over Tianjin, scheduled to take place every Thursday morning at 10:00 AM from the 10th of this month to the end of the month, touring the entire city for 15 minutes. The fare is five yuan for adults and half price for children. Ticket sales have now begun.

### Social and Economic Situation in Guangdong Province in the Past Year

Currency Inflation, Silver Gradually Concentrated, Prices of All Commodities Soar, People's Purchasing Power Weak, Commercial Businesses Feeling the Difference Between Then and Now

Guangzhou Correspondence: The social economy and various commercial businesses in Guangdong Province in the past year have suffered due to the inflexibility of social finance, the continuous issuance of Guangdong currency, the gradual concentration of silver in the official treasury, and the rising prices of goods. Not only has the price of rice soared, but all daily necessities, as well as oil, salt, firewood, and charcoal, are more than twice as expensive as usual. The main reason is currency inflation. Goods that were normally based on silver are now at least 20% more expensive because the government buys silver and exchanges it for paper money at a rate of two to one. Therefore, goods that normally cost one yuan now require 1.2 yuan to purchase. The excessively high exchange rate between Guangdong fractional currency and national currency (silver dollars) (a ratio of 1.5 to 1, i.e., 1.5 yuan of Guangdong fractional currency equals one yuan of national currency) is also a factor in the recent increase in the cost of living in Guangdong Province. Goods in Guangdong that are supplied from neighboring provinces are all purchased on a silver dollar basis. Now the silver dollar exchange rate is as high as 1.5 to 1, which not only makes the Cantonese people feel the pain of expensive domestic goods, but also greatly impacts the sales of domestic goods entering Guangdong.

In the past year, the authorities have vigorously purchased silver. Silver has now disappeared in the urban areas, but in the counties and towns, because the villagers are accustomed to saving and hoarding cash, it is all in silver, which is not easy to circulate for a while. In order to absorb as much as possible, the authorities have entrusted the postal offices in various townships to collect silver on their behalf. At first, the amount collected was still small, but as the Lunar New Year approached, the villagers began to sell all their stored silver to make a living for the year. As a result, the amount of silver collected by postal offices in various places suddenly increased. At the same time, fractional currency circulating in the countryside is also rampant, and the trend of prices rising by 20% is inevitable. However, with the prices of goods expensive, the wages earned by hardworking farmers and workers have not increased. On the one hand, the remuneration remains the same, and on the other hand, the consumption suddenly increases. Therefore, those who earn a living by labor cannot support their parents and raise their children. Their hardship is difficult to describe. Also, because the authorities are working hard to absorb silver and need a lot of fractional currency, the provincial bank has issued 14 million yuan of new fractional currency in recent months, as far as is known. It is said that it is still being issued this month for the purpose of purchasing silver.

Less than 30-40% of commercial businesses can make a profit. Due to the high cost of raw materials, the cost of industrial products is also high. For example, ordinary socks, which normally cost only 20 cents per pair, have recently risen to 25 cents per pair, which hinders sales. The same is true for knitted clothing. Machine-made calico has been greatly reduced in sales due to export tax and unified tax. Therefore, in the past year, most handicrafts have suffered losses. Recently, there has been a rice shortage in the province, and the price of rice has soared. It is difficult for the middle class to maintain two meals a day, so there is no extra money for miscellaneous food. Therefore, most of the tea houses and restaurants that were once prosperous are not doing well. More than a dozen large tea houses closed at the end of last year, and many large restaurants also closed down. The business of so-called grand hotels is also struggling, and in reality, there is no profit to be made. As for rice bran businesses, due to the influence of expensive rice, those who normally store rice stones have a slight profit. However, after the price of rice is expensive, the purchased rice is lost during the grinding process, and there is no large profit to be made. As for the candy, seafood, cured meat, paper goods, firecracker, oil bean, clothing, and shoe industries, which are usually busy at the end of the year, the business at the end of the year is less than 50-60% of the previous year. As for the antique business, which is only for the leisure of the idle class, even fewer people are interested. People's purchasing power is weak, and the trend is getting worse and worse. Those who are concerned about the social and economic situation are all worried about this. (February 10th)

### Excellent Phenomena of General Account Closing in Fuzhou's Commercial Market

All Shops Can Clear Accounts; Most Qian Zhuang (Native Banks) Repayments Also Completed

Fuzhou Correspondence: In this city's commercial market, the goods sold by shops, except for those with strong capital who can purchase with cash and obtain particularly low prices, are mostly sold with payments in installments, ranging from sixty days or more to one hundred days. The trade guilds add interest to the price depending on the length of the term. During the year-end general account closing period according to the lunar calendar, all accounts must be settled and cleared. However, for goods wholesaled by the trade guilds one or two months before the general account closing, it is considered "over the year" goods, and the first installment is collected only on the second day of the second lunar month. During this period, the funds from sales can be used to manage and repay old debts, so the second day of the second lunar month is the first difficult hurdle for the commercial market, and the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth lunar month is the last difficult hurdle. This day is the general settlement of all goods payments for the entire year, requiring the repayment of approximately 90% of the loans, with the remaining 10% to be repaid by the twenty-eighth day. The sixth day of this month was the last difficult hurdle for the Fuzhou commercial market. Because the sales of various specialty products such as tea, wood, paper, and bamboo shoots were very good last year, increasing by about one-half to two-thirds compared to previous years, the financial market was quite active. Although the request for loans of five million yuan from the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to alleviate the lunar New Year financial strain was not approved, all businesses were still able to repay the debts as scheduled, and no bankruptcies occurred. By the twenty-eighth day of the lunar month (i.e., the ninth day), the remaining small amounts were settled, and no problems arose. As for the loans that shops borrowed from the Qian Zhuang (native banks), although they must be settled during the general account closing period, those with strong capital successively deposit funds to repay the debts during the twelfth lunar month. The latest is around the time of the Kitchen God festival; after this, they are considered "lower-tier" clients, and the Qian Zhuang will have to consider and require guarantees when sending statements next year in the remaining spring season. However, in the past when the Qian Zhuang were prosperous, shops often issued "year-end term bills" to Qian Zhuang A to repay debts to Qian Zhuang B, and issued "year-end term bills" to Qian Zhuang B to repay debts to Qian Zhuang C. Now that there are only a few Qian Zhuang, the above method is difficult to achieve. If there is no relief measure, it will inevitably lead to bankruptcies. Therefore, in recent years, Qian Zhuang have come up with a flexible solution: if a shop has difficulty with financial stagnation, the amount owed on the statement can be rounded off into a whole number and converted into a term bill. At the end of the lunar year, only interest needs to be paid, and the principal can be repaid in the coming spring. However, last year, all export goods showed improvement, and the funds remitted back during the year-end were considerable. Most businesses have already repaid their debts to the Qian Zhuang. Those who had difficulty making up for business losses in previous years or had special circumstances were also allowed to convert their debts into term bills to maintain the status quo and overcome the difficulties.

### Songjiang

Burglary at the Dianyie Bank (Pawn Banking)

The Dianyie Bank in this city has been open for many years and has had very good business. It was closed for the Spring Festival holiday, and on the first day of the holiday, i.e., New Year's Day of the lunar calendar, a burglary suddenly occurred. The next morning, the back door was found wide open. After the staff reported it to the authorities, they all began to investigate and found that the iron clamps of the vault were twisted off. The silver dollars in the vault, which were always placed in another small box, were all gone without a trace, leaving an empty box. The banknotes were scattered in disarray. After checking the losses, it was estimated that 3,000 silver dollars and over 4,000 paper dollars were stolen. The local government dispatched detectives to investigate and, together with the staff, inspected the scene. It was determined that the thief was definitely not a person and escaped from the back door, but there were no clues to be found regarding the path of entry. It was said that solving the case would require a lot of research. The police authorities are now conducting a strict investigation and intensifying patrols.

Heavy Snowfall in Songjiang Yesterday

The temperature in this city dropped sharply on the 12th, and it was very cold. At noon, heavy snow suddenly began to fall and stopped only in the evening. Followed by a northern wind, thick ice formed everywhere. It was unprecedented since last winter.

### Jiading

Murder and Body Disposal in Shigang Township

Zhu, from Xiaozhai Village, Shigang Township, First District, took Fang Tai, the younger brother from Qingqiao Village, as her husband. Zhu was promiscuous and had more than one lover. On the night of the 5th, she and her lover strangled her husband to death and threw the body under the east side of the Lujia Bridge, intending to claim that he had fallen into the river and drowned in order to cover up her crime. Unexpectedly, in a moment of mental confusion, only the feet were in the water, and most of the body remained on land. The next morning, passersby saw it and ran to tell Zhu, but she did not recognize it as her husband, which only made things worse. The villagers were already convinced that Zhu had committed murder based on the above two pieces of evidence. The Baojia chief, while monitoring Zhu, reported it to the county government. The county government sent an inspector on the 6th for an autopsy, which only revealed a minor injury to the throat. After Zhu was taken to the county, she was soon released on bail, and the deceased's family made a great uproar. The deceased's mother, Ye Hu, led more than twenty people to express their dissatisfaction. Chen Youmin, the chief of the county police bureau, based on the report from the Malu branch station in the area, personally went to the township on the 8th to investigate and learned all the facts. Ye Hu also identified the lover who committed the crime as Zhou Yaoren from the same township. The police were immediately ordered to arrest him, but he had already fled. The obtained evidence was prepared in a document and sent to the county along with Zhu for investigation and handling.

Most Commercial Accounts Were Profitable

Last year's autumn harvest was good, and the social economy showed a slight turnaround. Prices of all goods tended to rise, and the development of commerce was unprecedented in the past five years. Most industries made profits. The Jiafeng Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, established at the beginning, had a good opportunity. Although it suffered some losses by selling a portion of its products in advance, the result was a profit of 300,000 yuan. The next best were the cotton and foreign goods industries, which also made considerable profits. However, the banking industry, due to the difficulty in issuing loans, was unable to fully expand its business, and its profits were not as abundant as those of other industries.

### Kunshan

Bribery Case in Re-examination of Drug Addicts

Gao Zhongliang, from Zhengyi Town, Seventh District of the county, was reported to have relapsed into opium addiction during the general re-examination of drug addicts. He was arrested by the local police station and sent to the county government, which transferred him to the county hospital for re-examination. Gao was terrified and secretly discussed bribing with Yuan Kegong and Xue A'gen, a carriage driver at the hospital, and handed over 200 yuan in legal tender. Unexpectedly, the hospital's re-examination result was that he was addicted but had no drugs in his system. He was sent to the county for legal handling. Gao then confessed the whole story. Peng, the county magistrate, was furious at the carriage driver Xue A'gen's audacity and immediately ordered his arrest and detention. Yuan Kegong and Wang Picheng, who were also involved, were also arrested. It is said that the inside story of the case is complicated, and a strict investigation is currently underway, and they will be severely punished according to the law.

### Suzhou

Progress of Street Widening

The authorities have decided to borrow 300,000 yuan from a consortium of banks to implement the Suzhou street widening plan. However, local people pointed out that during the January 28th Shanghai Incident, 180,000 yuan of local construction funds from Wu County were borrowed by the provincial government to build defense works. It is now proposed to recover this debt from the provincial government to offset this loan. Magistrate Deng has reported this matter to Chairman Chen. Chen believes that Suzhou streets urgently need comprehensive planning, and all streets that should be widened should be widened. Not only can the 180,000 yuan be returned to the locality, but the province will also allocate half of the Suzhou land price tax, which is over 100,000 yuan annually, for nearly five years to be fully used for Wu County's construction expenses, totaling 500,000 yuan. A Suzhou Municipal Engineering Office will be established to specialize in planning Suzhou's construction.

Yongsheng Qian Zhuang (Native Bank) Closes

Yongsheng, a large Qian Zhuang (native bank) in Suzhou with the "Fu" character, closed at the end of the lunar year because the business scope of Qian Zhuang has been narrowing in recent years and there is little hope for the future. The major shareholders of the Zhuang are Wang and Yu, who are currently handling all debts owed and owed to others.

### Changshu

Good Harvest for All Industries in General Account Closing

The general account closing period for this year has ended, and businesses are now in a period of rest. Most have not officially reopened. Regarding profits and losses, statistics have not yet been compiled. However, according to the merchants, the account collection has been very good due to the bumper autumn harvest. The accounts in the urban and suburban areas have had excellent results, with a total income of about 80-90%. Although the rural accounts benefited from the abundant autumn harvest, the farmers have accumulated losses over the years and have not yet recovered. Fortunately, there are very few rural accounts, so the impact is not significant. Based on the above situation, all industries have made profits. After celebrating the God of Wealth Festival on the fifth day of the lunar New Year, all businesses will fully reopen.

Spring Cold Damages Wheat Crops

Since winter, there have been three snowfalls here, but it has not been severely cold. The Celsius temperature has often exceeded forty degrees. Unexpectedly, recently, as spring has arrived, the weather has suddenly changed. Rain and snow have been falling intermittently since the 10th, and it snowed all day on the 12th. Although it has cleared up on the 13th, the spring cold is very severe. The Fahrenheit temperature has dropped sharply to twenty-eight degrees, so solid ice can be seen everywhere. According to the villagers, this kind of spring snow and spring cold is very unfavorable for wheat in the fields, and the wheat roots will rot, resulting in a poor harvest.

### Wuxi

Spring Snow Flies in the County

There has been little rain and snow in the county since last winter, and the weather has been dry. Until the day before yesterday, the sky was overcast, and then heavy rain began to pour down. Soon after, a northwest wind rose sharply, and the weather turned cold. Spring snow flew with the wind and stopped slightly around 5 p.m., accumulating four or five inches of snow. On the morning of the 13th, the sun shone brightly, causing the ice and snow to gradually melt. This is greatly beneficial to agricultural crops and can also reduce folk diseases.

### Jiangyin

Rural Harvest and Stable Commerce

Jiangyin industries conducted general account closing on the 10th. Due to the improvement in the rural economy last year, all industries showed improvement, and account collection reached 80-90%. All land rents were fully collected, and even old rents were paid off. Among the industries, the silver and money industry made the most profit, followed by cotton cloth, cotton yarn, coal, rice, and silk cloth, with full profits. Only the Liyi yarn factory suffered a loss of 50,000-60,000 yuan because the former manager, Wang Jiyun, sold 100,000 bales of cotton yarn when the Sino-Japanese negotiations were tense. Otherwise, the business would have been very successful. The Huacheng cloth factory is planning to add machines and expand. The Yuandetang West shop on Dongda Street is rumored to be closing down due to too many debts and insufficient turnover.

### Changzhou

All Industries Profited in General Account Closing

Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, Wuyi industries have been in a state of recession for many years, with losses and no gains, and many shops have closed down as a result. In 1936, the four rural areas had abundant agricultural and animal husbandry products, and the silk and ramie harvests in spring and summer were also good. The farmers' purchasing power increased slightly, and the business of various industries also improved as a result. Last winter, the prices of goods suddenly rose, and business became even more prosperous. Therefore, by the time of the general account closing period, all shops and factories, large and small, had made profits. This phenomenon can be said to be unprecedented in many years. Among the industries, the yarn and cloth factories made the most profit. The Dacheng Yarn Factory made a profit of nearly two million and will add a third factory this year. The Minfeng Yarn Factory also made a profit of several hundred thousand. The cloth factories made tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. The Shanghai and Wujin banks made the most profit in the banking industry, followed by the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Guohua. Among the silk cloth industries, Tian Guancha and Renhe made the most profit. In addition, the Hengfeng Flour Mill and various oil factories made considerable profits. The foreign and Guang goods industry, yarn and flower industry, and copper and iron industry also had profits due to the increase in commodity prices. Therefore, all industries were overjoyed.

### Nantung

Overview of General Account Closing for All Industries

In the general account closing at the end of the lunar year in Tung County, the yarn industry was the most successful. All factories and large and small firms made profits. The native cloth, sundries, and food industries were next. The foreign goods industry made profits due to the increase in commodity prices after autumn. The cotton industry suffered losses due to abnormal market conditions. The salt reclamation industry suffered heavy losses due to the poor cotton harvest.

There are Many Drug Addicts in Tung County

The six counties in Tung County conducted a general re-examination of drug addicts. After 40 days of door-to-door investigation, nearly 10,000 male and female addicts were found, resulting in the temples in the urban and suburban areas being converted into temporary detention centers. Drug addict factories have been expanded to accommodate them. Before February 20th, the Baojia chiefs are still responsible for reporting.

### The Overall Account Closing Situation of Various Industries in Shanghai is Improving

Businesses Will Resume as Usual Tomorrow After the Spring Holiday

The silver and money industry and various industrial and commercial industries in this city have been closed for four days during the Spring Festival holiday, as usual, and will resume business tomorrow after the holiday. Last year, due to the abundant agricultural production and the recovery of industry and commerce, the overall account closing of various industries was safely passed, and the financial situation was greatly improved. This is an unprecedented situation in the past five years. According to the records released by the banking industry on the financial situation in the past 23 years:

Financial Stability

Since China was attacked by the global recession, the financial panic was most severe in 1934 and 1935. During the overall account closing period in 1934, a small number of banks and firms were forced to close. In 1935, the degree of financial tension increased daily. Throughout the year, a total of 14 banks in this city closed, with a total capital of over 27 million yuan. A total of 9 exchange firms closed, with a total capital of over 2.1 million yuan. As a result, the government had to adopt emergency relief policies and announced the reform of the currency system on November 4, 1935, and implemented the new currency system. The financial panic gradually subsided. At that time, although prices were temporarily stimulated and increased due to speculation, they eventually returned to normal because various industries had not yet actually recovered. Therefore, the overall account closing period in 1935 was a period of stopping the panic due to the new currency system after the fatigue of previous years. Although the call loan interest rate returned to ease, there were still many rumors in the public debt and foreign exchange markets. The financial industry had just caught its breath and could only be said to be maintaining the status quo. During the overall account closing period last year, the call loan interest rate was relaxed, the foreign exchange rate was stable, the circulation of bills increased, and the prices of public debt securities trended upward. This can be said to be a period of financial stability.

Recovery of Various Industries

The reasons for financial stability during the overall account closing period last year were: ㊀ The financial industry progressed with the recovery of various industries. Domestically, the rural economy recovered due to the abundant agricultural production, so the purchasing power in the interior increased. The sales of daily necessities such as yarn and cloth were widespread and prices rose. Freight increased, and the shipping industry also made profits. Internationally, as the world economy gradually recovered, international commodity prices tended to rise, so domestic commodity prices also rose accordingly. Especially with the world's arms race, the export of domestic military raw materials such as antimony, tungsten, copper, tin, silk, and grain increased, and prices became even more expensive. ㊁ The financial industry itself had previously suffered from excessive investment in real estate, resulting in heavy capital being idle, or engaging in speculation such as bidding, which had an impact. After the turmoil, it has changed to a conservative approach, tightening credit and focusing on mortgage business. Last year, the important loans of various banks belonged to economic construction, such as road construction, electricity, sericulture, fisheries, and agricultural warehouse transportation and sales loans, totaling more than 100 million yuan. This not only consolidated the foundation of the financial industry, but also greatly helped the progress of the national economy. Other factors such as the stability of the central political situation and the strengthening of the government's maintenance forces, although the Suiyuan War, the Southwest Issue, and the Xi'an Incident occurred during the year, the government's policies did not change slightly. It made every effort to maintain international exchange rates, which prevented disasters from taking shape and stabilized people's hearts. Financial stability was not accidental. If more efforts are made this year, the situation should improve further.

### Mayor Wu Personally Inspects the Neighborhoods on Lunar New Year's Eve

All Municipal Government Agencies Will Work as Usual on the 11th

It is customary in the Chinese business community to use the end of the lunar year as the account closing period, and the general public also uses the Spring Festival as a time for timely enjoyment. This year's end of the year, due to the improvement in the market and the stability of national affairs, is gradually showing a sign of rejuvenation and prosperity compared to previous years. In order to observe the people's sentiments, Mayor Wu drove to various urban areas of the city on New Year's Eve to inspect them. He was deeply gratified to witness the stability of the neighborhoods and the high spirits of the people preparing to celebrate the Spring Festival. The 11th is the Lunar New Year, and government agencies will work as usual according to custom. In addition to personally handling important official matters at the municipal government, Mayor Wu also visited various important agencies under the municipal government for a week. It is said that the personnel of all agencies are able to do their best in their duties as usual.

### Money Industry Resumes Business Tomorrow

Some Increase Capital and Reorganize, Some Close Down

The New Voice News Agency reported that after the various industries handled the overall account closing, the banks and Qian Zhuang (native banks) will resume business tomorrow after a four-day holiday. The Money Industry Association will hold a group worship ceremony at the Northern City Guild Hall at 9 a.m. on the 11th. The managers of all Qian Zhuang that will be listed this year, such as the exchange Qian Zhuang Fuyuan, Shunkang, Fukang, and Tongqing, over forty firms, will participate and are scheduled to report their listing to the association today. Other Qian Zhuang with the characters Yuan, Heng, Li, and Zhen are also scheduled to report their listing to the Money Industry Market and the Money Exchange Association today. It is said that in addition to the Shunkang, Hengjiu, Zhengxiang, Zhixiang, and Cunde firms increasing capital, the Yichang and other firms will slightly reorganize, and several firms will close down. The list of listed Qian Zhuang and the profit numbers of each firm last year are said to be officially released by the Money Industry Market tomorrow.

### Two Public Bonds Redeemed by Lottery

Totaling Over 8.85 Million Yuan Redeemed; Payments Made in This Month and July

The third lottery for the redemption of the Republic of China 25th Year Unified Public Bonds Class A bonds and the first lottery for the redemption of the first issue of the Second Railway Construction Public Bonds was held at the Banking Association at 10 a.m. on the 10th. Attending were auditing representative Lin Jinyu from the Auditing Department, Zhuang Dezhi from the Banking Association, Yan Dayou from the Money Industry Association, Pei Yunqing from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the lottery members Jin Wenyuan from the Central Bank, Tang Yusun from the Bank of China, and Fan Chuchen from the Bank of Communications. Tao Changshan, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, presided over the ceremony. After conducting the ceremony, he gave a report. The supervisors then inspected the ledger of the signing and withdrawal of funds before executing the lottery. A total of eight branches of the Unified Class A Bonds were drawn: 040, 149, 212, 400, 407, 692, 877, and 963, with a total principal redemption of 1.2 million yuan. Five branches of the Railway Public Bonds were drawn: 20, 46, 53, 79, and 91, with a total principal redemption of 2 million yuan. The total principal redemption for both bonds was 3.2 million yuan, plus 4.455 million yuan in interest due on the Unified Class A Bonds and 1.2 million yuan in interest due on the Railway Bonds, for a total of 8.855 million yuan in principal and interest. The principal and interest on the Railway Bonds will be paid starting from February 28, and the principal and interest on the Unified Class A Bonds will be paid starting from July 31 by the Central Bank and its entrusted Bank of China and Bank of Communications branches in various places, as well as the Central Trust Bureau. The matured bonds can be discounted at the Bank of China and Bank of Communications and can be rediscounted at the Central Bank.

### Twenty-Five Years of Revenue from Two Railways

### Two China Merchants Bureau Ships Encountered Trouble with Waves Yesterday

"Xinjiangtian" Arrived in Shanghai; "Haixiang" Temporarily Anchored

The "Xinjiangtian" of the China Merchants Bureau's Ningbo route, which departed from Yong (Ningbo) the day before yesterday and arrived at the mouth of Wusong yesterday morning at dawn, was hit by a fierce northwest wind. The captain, believing that the ship was a scheduled liner and had to arrive on time, risked proceeding. However, the monstrous waves caused the ship to sway violently from side to side. A huge wave crashed over the deck, damaging one end of the bridge. Fortunately, by sailing against the wind, it was able to enter the Huangpu River and arrive safely in Shanghai. The passengers celebrated their good fortune. The damaged bridge was repaired yesterday and departed as usual last night to Yong.

The China Merchants Bureau's "Haixiang" also reported yesterday that when the ship reached the Jiuduan River area in the Tongsha waters, it was suddenly hit by a strong westerly wind. The waves were huge and overwhelming. The captain immediately steered the ship out of the Yangtze River estuary in the fierce wind and waves and anchored to temporarily avoid the storm, waiting for the wind and waves to subside before sailing again.

### The Association for the Recovery of Pilotage Rights Issued a Declaration Yesterday

Petition Representatives to Go to Beijing Today

The China Seamen's Union, the Shanghai Seamen's Branch, the China Seamen's Party Branch, and various seamen's organizations, for the pilotage rights issue, had previously formed the Chinese Seamen's Committee for Petitioning the Government to Recover Pilotage Rights. Now, the committee has specifically appointed Li Jianbai, Hu Qi, Feng Fu. Cheng, and ten others to go to Beijing today afternoon to petition. Yesterday, they issued a declaration stating: Since the opening of the five treaty ports and the opening of domestic navigation, the pilotage duties for ships entering and exiting various ports along our coast and rivers have gradually been coveted by foreigners. In the seventh year of Tongzhi, Robert Hart, the British customs commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, formulated the General Regulations for Pilotage, allowing foreigners to freely serve as pilots in our ports. Subsequently, Daniel Baugh, the British River Inspector of the Jianghai Customs, further designated the Tongsha pilotage rights to be exclusively managed by foreigners. From this, the guest has usurped the role of the host. Not only have the pilotage duties been mostly occupied by foreigners, but the management rights of pilotage affairs have also been seized by foreigners. Over the decades, the impact and damage our country has suffered in terms of navigation and national defense cannot be expressed in words. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it had the determination to recover pilotage rights. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Pilotage Training Institute was established to cultivate talent. In the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, the Provisional Regulations for Pilotage Management were promulgated, stipulating that each port should be jointly organized by the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of the Navy, the Ministry of Military Affairs, and local chambers of commerce to form a pilotage management committee. Furthermore, any vacancies in the pilotage quota for each port should be filled by Chinese pilots. This is truly the best method for recovering pilotage rights. However, local ports have not yet sent personnel to organize, and a laissez-faire attitude is still adopted towards foreign pilots. Although Shanghai has been established, the power is in the hands of foreign customs officials. Although various ministries have representatives, they are like decorations. The government believes that having foreign officials handle matters would eliminate any obstacles. Who would have known that the opposite is true? Foreign pilots refuse to accept our country's methods because of foreign officials (because foreign pilots believe that they should not help their own kind and work for China. If China really wants to recover pilotage rights, Chinese people should come out and handle it. We are all foreigners, why should we help China?). Therefore, the chairman of the Shanghai Pilotage Management Committee, the British national Carnell, driven by sympathy, changed his policy, abandoned the mission of recovering Tongsha, and instead controlled the practice of Chinese Yangtze River pilots in order to deceive our government and maintain his position. Counting the years since the establishment of the committee, it has neither restrained foreign pilots to make them comply, nor reduced the unemployment of Chinese pilots to make them prosper. Not only is it useless, but it is also harmful to the country. Currently, foreign pilots in various ports have become even more intensified and have expanded more than before. Chinese pilots still live and die on their own, struggling under the guarantee of no government. This proves that entrusting foreign officials to preside over the Shanghai Pilotage Management Committee is definitely ineffective. And our country has many ports. If according to the regulations, each ministry would have one representative, there would have to be dozens of people, and each ministry would not have that many representatives to send. Although the Provisional Regulations for Pilotage are good, there is no mechanism to implement them. What can be done? Therefore, to remedy the situation, the government should revise the aforementioned regulations, abolish the organization of pilotage management committees in various ports, and, based on the Ministry of Communications Organization Law promulgated by the National Government in the 20th year, return the management of all pilotage personnel in the country to the Ministry of Communications. At the same time, the Ministry of Communications should holistically plan to cultivate the next generation of pilotage talent and ensure the stability of the current pilotage personnel, so that their lives are stable and they do not become increasingly desolate. As for the pilotage quota for each port, it must be stipulated according to the current number of Chinese and foreign pilots. If there are any vacancies, they must be filled by Chinese pilot trainees and not by foreign pilots. Only in this way can effective results be achieved. The matter concerns national defense and navigation rights. We earnestly request the unified attention of the people of the country. Our association follows the wishes of seamen nationwide and is organized by seamen's groups from various places. It has now been legally established. In addition to appealing to the central government, we also ask all sectors of the country to advocate and assist in the implementation so as to achieve the goal of management by the Ministry of Communications and to facilitate the recovery of pilotage rights. May national defense be fortunate, may navigation be fortunate. This is our declaration. We respectfully ask for your consideration.

### Rickshaw Owners and Pullers Protested Against Rickshaw Reduction and Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday Morning

With the Implementation Date of March 1st Approaching, They Requested Negotiations with the Public Works Department to Withdraw the Order

Since the Public Works Department announced its decision on the 20th of this month to reduce the number of rickshaws by lottery, rickshaw owners and pullers have expressed their opposition. It is learned that both parties petitioned yesterday morning separately. The details are as follows:

Rickshaw Pullers' Appeal

Rickshaw pullers in the special district, in order to oppose the Public Works Department's reduction of rickshaws, have petitioned various party and government departments, requesting negotiations. At 9:00 am yesterday morning, rickshaw puller representatives Chen Guoliang, Bian Changfa, and Fu Guomin submitted a petition to the Rickshaw Guild, requesting: 1. Organize the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Labor-Capital Joint Office according to law in order to effectively respond. 2. Elect labor-capital and contractor representatives to be responsible for negotiations. 3. Petition party and government agencies to request the Public Works Department to withdraw the order, and not to stop until the goal is achieved. 4. Form a legal team and ask lawyers Wu Chengyu and Wu Kaisheng to negotiate and postpone the lottery. 5. Authorize the office to be responsible for the process. Bao Zhenhuang and others received them and agreed to assist in the negotiations.

Rickshaw Owners' Petition

The Rickshaw Guild held a representative meeting of the five districts the day before yesterday and resolved: 1. Petition the municipal government to raise negotiations. 2. Request the Public Works Department to postpone the implementation for three months. At 9:00 am yesterday morning, representatives Bao Zhenhuang, Zhao Fengshan, Zhu Lujiang, Qiu Jilang, Wang Wentao, and Li Tianchun petitioned the municipal government. Section member Yu Mingde received them and promised to request instructions for handling. They then went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. Section member Wang Binjun received them and promised to find a way to handle the matter immediately. The petition stated: Regarding the petition, the rickshaws operating in the special district of this city have been licensed by your government and the French Concession, and have been operating throughout the city for many years. The guild leadership and rickshaw owners have always strictly adhered to the payment of taxes and government orders, and have never dared to overstep. However, since the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the Public Works Department has used the name of rescuing rickshaw pullers to reform the rickshaws within the concession in order to carry out its economic aggression. The establishment of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee has severely damaged our rickshaw industry. Although various rickshaw owners have compromised and reluctantly made concessions, the Public Works Department has become more aggressive and resolved last year to reduce the number of rickshaws within the concession by 500, effective March 1st of this year. For several months, the guild has argued reasonably and appealed everywhere, but the Public Works Department believes that reducing the number of rickshaws is a proposition advocated by the Western directors, and in order to maintain the prestige of foreigners within the concession, it refuses to withdraw the order. In addition to making further legal efforts, we find that the deadline of February 1st is approaching. If the rickshaw reduction is implemented, not only will the businesses of hundreds of rickshaw owners go bankrupt, but the rickshaw pullers who lose their jobs, along with their families, will amount to about ten thousand people. If this continues, not only will the rickshaw industry be in danger, but it will also be a major hidden danger for the future of society. Therefore, we have specifically appointed representatives to come forward to petition, hoping that you will consider the livelihood of the poor, grant assistance, and negotiate with the Public Works Department of the Public Concession to withdraw the order to reduce the number of rickshaws, so as to preserve the rickshaw industry and maintain livelihoods. We are at the point of desperation.

### Zhang Shijie Went to Guangdong Yesterday

To Take Office as President of the Bin'an District Court

Professor Zhang Shijie of the Law Department of Shanghai College of Law and Politics has been appointed by the Ministry of Justice as the President of the Bin'an District Court in Guangdong. He took the China Merchants Bureau's "Haizhen" ship to Guangdong yesterday to assume his new post. Zhang has served in the Ministry of Judicial Administration for many years and has held positions such as secretary of the National Government's representative office in France, professor at National Central University, prosecutor of the Zhongshan branch of the Guangzhou District Court, and judge of the Shanghai Second Special District Court. He has extensive experience, and his appointment as the president of the Bin'an District Court this time will surely make even greater contributions.

### Japanese Warship "Izumo" Departs Shanghai

According to the Japanese "Shanghai Daily," the Third Fleet flagship "Izumo," commanded by Commander Hasegawa, has departed Shanghai at 11:30 am on the 13th after returning to Shanghai from a cruise in South China. It is scheduled to visit various places in North China and return to Shanghai around the 6th of next month.

### The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Will Soon Be Fully Open to Traffic

Passenger Cars Ordered from England Delivered in Shanghai; Vehicle Assembly Submitted to the Ministry of Railways for Approval

In order to ensure that the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway will soon be fully open to traffic, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau found that the original passenger cars would be insufficient. It was approved by the Ministry of Railways to use British Boxer Indemnity funds to purchase 21 passenger car chassis. The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board approved the purchase, and a contract was signed in the name of the Ministry of Railways, countersigned by the Bureau, with the British Boxer Indemnity Association. After repeated consultations on the construction drawings of the passenger cars, the Ministry of Railways issued a purchase order in June of the 24th year and sent it to the London Purchasing Committee of the British Boxer Indemnity Association for ordering from the British Duzeng Vehicle Manufacturing Company. The order included 18 third-class cars, 15 first and second-class cars, and a complete set of equipment, with a total cost of approximately 510,000 yuan in national currency. All the goods have been shipped in three batches by the end of last year and delivered in Shanghai. The Bureau is currently submitting the vehicle assembly plan to the Ministry of Railways for approval.

### China National Aviation Corporation Report

Achievements in the Twenty-Fifth Year; Plans for the Twenty-Sixth Year

During the twenty-fifth year, all the development plans of the China National Aviation Corporation were not only fully realized but also exceeded expectations. The increase in the number of passengers, mail, and packages this year has exceeded that of the twenty-fourth year (the highest record for the company previously). The board of directors' policy of purchasing the latest aircraft has clearly given passengers greater confidence. The passenger mileage for the past year was more than double that of the twenty-fourth year, which is clear proof. In the twenty-first year, the company had only one route, with a distance of only 1,691 kilometers. Since then, it has gradually developed, and by the twenty-fifth year, there were four routes, totaling 5,280 kilometers. Also, in the twenty-first year, the actual flying mileage of the company's aircraft was 694,143 kilometers. In the twenty-fifth year, it increased to 2,466,477 kilometers. In terms of passenger mileage, the twenty-first year was only 1,247,808 passenger kilometers, while the twenty-fifth year was 12,006,944 passenger kilometers. The number of passengers also increased from 3,153 to 18,567 during the same period. If we calculate from the founding of the company in the twentieth year of the Republic of China to the end of the twenty-fifth year, the total number of passengers carried is 46,383, the actual flying mileage is 8,917,950 kilometers, and the total passenger mileage is 25,110,003 passenger kilometers.

Our country's civil aviation is still in its infancy. The China National Aviation Corporation deeply understands its mission and is eager to take the lead. Today, ground transportation is no longer sufficient to meet the needs of general passengers. Therefore, fast and comfortable air transportation is an urgent need. Because our country is vast, this type of transportation is most suitable.

Everyone knows that transportation is most conducive to the progress of our country, and the development of civil aviation cannot be ignored. Therefore, to understand the progress of our country, one can see the general situation by observing the aviation industry. On October 20th of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, the China National Aviation Corporation's Los Angeles aircraft carried passengers and mail from Longhua, Shanghai on its maiden voyage to Hankou, covering a distance of 864 kilometers (539 miles) and flying for seven hours. On May 12th of the twenty-fifth year, a Douglas jumbo jet of our company flew 3,901 kilometers (2,423 miles) in one day, stopping nine times, and the flight time was less than thirteen hours. The mileage flown was almost five times that of the maiden voyage seven years ago. This shows the progress of our country's civil aviation during this period. Also, in the twenty-fifth year, the company's passenger mileage increased more than double that of the twenty-fourth year, which is enough to prove that the people of the country are increasingly interested in the aviation industry.

On October 23rd of the twenty-fourth year, our company also launched the Shanghai-Chengdu express flight with Douglas jumbo jets. It takes only three hours to fly from Shanghai to Hankou, and less than seven hours to reach Chengdu, a distance of 1,981 kilometers. Therefore, the convenience of air travel has further attracted the attention of the people of the country. The flight was originally scheduled to operate once a week, but from July 3rd of the twenty-fifth year, it was changed to three times a week.

Last summer, the Douglas jumbo jets on the Shanghai-Beijing line were originally scheduled to operate four times a week, but due to the congestion of passengers, it was changed to a same-day round trip on June 9th. The flight personnel on this route completed a journey of 2,654 kilometers in one day, and their work is also commendable. The Shanghai-Guangzhou line has also been operating three times a week since September 1st of the twenty-fifth year, flying a distance of 1,623 kilometers in less than seven hours. On November 5th of the same year, this line also flew through Hong Kong.

On February 13th of the twenty-fifth year, a joint transportation contract was signed by our company and Air France, operating once a week between Guangzhou and Hanoi. Thus, the direct flight between Europe and Asia and our country's participation in the world aviation network were both realized.

On November 5th of the same year, the Shanghai-Guangzhou line aircraft landed in Hong Kong for the first time. Thus, the China National Aviation Corporation's route can also connect with the British Royal Airways route to reach Europe. The company extends its deepest gratitude to French Minister of Aviation Pierre Cot and British authorities, Hong Kong Governor Sir Geoffry Northcote.

Before February 1st of the twenty-fifth year, the domestic airmail rate system was based on air zones. The rate was 25 cents for every 20 grams per 1,000 kilometers of distance. In other words, each air zone was 25 cents, plus the regular postage of 5 cents, for a total of 30 cents. If it was two air zones, the rate was 55 cents. Three air zones, 80 cents. Four air zones, 1 yuan and 5 cents. With the assistance of the Directorate General of Posts and the approval of the Ministry of Communications, the above-mentioned air zone system was abolished on March 1st of the twenty-fifth year. All domestic airmail is charged 25 cents, plus the regular postage of 5 cents, for a total of 30 cents. Although the company's mail revenue has temporarily decreased after the abolition of this air zone system, the public is very welcome, and it is believed that the number of airmail will increase day by day.

After the Douglas jumbo jets used by our company on various routes, the fares at various locations have gradually decreased, with reduction rates ranging from 10% to 50%. The sharp increase in the number of passengers last year also shows that the China National Aviation Corporation's board of directors' decision to reduce fares was indeed appropriate.

The development plan for the twenty-sixth year is as follows: Before the summer of the twenty-sixth year, three Douglas jumbo jets can be delivered. At that time, the Shanghai-Chengdu express flight will be increased from the current three round trips per week to five round trips per week. The Shanghai-Beijing express flight may also be increased from three round trips per week to five round trips per week.

The Sikorsky seaplane, which has been widely publicized for a long time, is now scheduled to arrive in Shanghai in mid-February of this year. The aircraft can accommodate 18 passengers and 4 pilots, with a normal speed of 270 kilometers per hour. After the Shanghai-Guangzhou line uses this aircraft, the passenger transport situation will definitely improve. The current three round trips per week can be increased to four round trips at that time. After many tests by our company, two direction finders are now installed in the Douglas jumbo jets to maintain the accuracy of the flight. In the future, all jumbo jets of our company will be equipped with this equipment.

In order to achieve perfection in flight technology, our company will also establish fourteen radio beacon stations simultaneously. The locations of the beacon stations are on the Shanghai-Chengdu line and the Chongqing-Guiyang line, for Shanghai, Nanjing, Anqing, Jiujiang, Hankou, Yichang, Wanxian, Chongqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, etc. On the Shanghai-Xiamen line, for Haizhou, Qingdao, Tianjin, Beijing, etc. On the Shanghai-Guangzhou line, for Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, etc. After the beacon stations are established, and each jumbo jet is equipped with a direction finder, our company's night flight equipment can be compared with the most perfect flight equipment in the world, and the flight schedule will be more accurate.

After the jumbo jets arrive in Shanghai this summer, a huge hangar will be built at Longhua Airport to accommodate them. In addition, a passenger lounge will be built for the use of those waiting for the flight. Also, our company will build a huge ramp in the shortest possible time for the new Sikorsky S-43 aircraft. The completion of the above development plan will cost approximately 3 million yuan in national currency.

### British Tram Workers in the Public Concession Strike on the 9th and Return to Work on the 10th

Workers Submit Ten Demands for Wage Increases, Representatives to Negotiate with the Company on the 15th

Over two thousand workers in the Shanghai Tram Company's car department, including drivers, ticket sellers, conductors, and track switchers, went on strike at 5:30 AM on the 9th due to the company's failure to meet their demands for improved treatment. All tram and trolley bus lines were completely shut down. Upon receiving the report, the Party and government authorities, along with the Municipal General Labor Union, immediately sent representatives to mediate. A four-point agreement was reached at around 8:00 PM that evening, temporarily resolving the issue, and all workers returned to work on the morning of the 10th. The Dagongshe reporter investigated and recorded the details as follows:

Demands Rejected

The British-owned Tram Company's business increased by more than double last year compared to previous years, with considerable profits. All company staff, including coppersmiths, received wage increases, but the more than two thousand drivers, ticket sellers, inspectors, conductors, and track switchers in the car department received nothing. The workers expressed their dissatisfaction and submitted ten demands, sending representatives to demand them from General Manager Eveo, who refused to accept them. They continued to negotiate with Car Department Supervisor Golock, but still to no avail.

General Strike

The workers felt compelled to strike on the morning of the 9th at 5:30 AM, believing that the company authorities were unwilling to provide for their livelihoods. All tram lines (Route 1) Jing'an Temple to the Public Recreation Ground, (Route 2) Jing'an Temple to the 16th Pier, (Route 3) Macgregor Road to East Xinzha Bridge, (Route 4) Avenue Road to Tilanqiao, (Route 5) The former French Concession tram line from Old West Gate to the North Railway Station, now shortened due to the Public Concession tram strike, from Old West Gate to East Xinzha Bridge, (Route 6) Yuang Road, (Route 7) North Railway Station to Tilanqiao, (Route 8) Yangshupu to the 16th Pier, (Route 12) Jing'an Temple to Tilanqiao.

Representatives Petition

After all the tram and trolley bus workers went on strike, they selected four representatives to form a petition delegation. At 8:30 AM on the 9th, they went to the Municipal Party Headquarters, Municipal Government, Social Affairs Bureau, General Labor Union, and other organizations to petition. They were received separately by Yu Yaoqiu of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zhang (surname) of the Municipal Government, Zhu Guilin of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Gong Yuting of the General Labor Union. After the worker representatives stated their wishes, the Party and government representatives agreed to mediate and advised the representatives to urge all workers to await a resolution quietly.

Report to the Party and Government

Negotiations continued until 4:00 PM without results. They then resumed mediation at 6:30 PM, eventually deciding on the following principles: ① The ten demands put forward by the workers will be submitted to the board of directors for discussion.

If no resolution is reached, the Party and government agencies will mediate again. ② The company shall not dismiss striking workers under any pretext. ③ Wages for the strike period will be paid at half rate. ④ All workers shall return to work uniformly on the morning of the 10th. Therefore, the case was temporarily concluded.

Resumption of Work on the 10th

The Party and government authorities, in order to prevent the escalation of the situation and to seek a quick resolution at this time of general closing, sent personnel to consult with the company's General Manager Eveo and Car Department Supervisor Golock. It was then decided to resume work first. After the workers' demands were submitted to the board of directors for approval, a direct negotiation between labor and management was scheduled for the 15th of this month. Meanwhile, the Party and government representatives persuaded all workers to accept this plan, which the workers readily agreed to. Therefore, starting on the morning of the 10th, all workers arrived at the factory on time, and the vehicles were driven out to work as usual. The disturbance was brought to a temporary end, and traffic returned to normal. Moreover, as this day was the general closing day, all trams and public buses in the Public Concession, French Concession, and Chinese areas extended their operating hours to facilitate travel. Although it rained that morning, the rain stopped in the afternoon, so passengers going out to shop and taking trams were even more crowded than usual.

### Ministry of Communications Stipulates Registration Method for Long-Distance Calls

To Avoid Transmission Errors, to Be Implemented on March 1st

The Ministry of Communications, due to different dialects in various places in China, has found that errors in the transmission of the name and address of the called party often lead to missed calls, or that the name and address are lengthy and the pronunciation is obscure, requiring repeated explanations and wasting time. To reduce such difficulties and improve call efficiency, it has formulated a "Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Called Party Name and Address Registration Method," ordering the telephone bureau to implement it from March 1st. Now, the details of the method are recorded as follows: 1. In order to avoid errors in the name and address of the called party when receiving long-distance calls and to avoid affecting the call, the called party may apply to register their name and address. 2. Applicants should fill out an application form with the local telephone bureau under the Ministry of Communications that handles long-distance telephone services. After the application is approved by the telephone bureau, the telephone bureau will assign a number to replace the name and address of the called party and issue a registration certificate. 3. The address of the called party is limited to within the business area of the telephone bureau, and those without a fixed business area are limited to within three kilometers of the bureau. 4. After the called party obtains the registration certificate, they should immediately notify all relevant callers of the registration number. 5. When the caller transmits a long-distance call, the name and address of the called party may be replaced by the registration number, and the words "registration number" should be prefixed to the number. Example 1: Nanjing - Registration Number 315 - Ordinary Call - 22633 Li Changchun (used by those calling the telephone bureau). Example 2: Ordinary Call - Nanjing - Registration Number 315 - Zhang Sixia, No. 1 Zhongshan Road, Shanghai (filled out by those at retail outlets). 6. The registration is valid from the date of issuance of the registration certificate to the end of the year. Those who wish to continue the registration after the expiration date should apply to the original telephone bureau two weeks before the expiration date. A renewed registration certificate will be issued, and the registration will remain valid for one year. 7. If the called party does not continue to apply within the time limit, the original telephone bureau may cancel their registration number on the expiration date and invalidate the certificate. 8. If the caller still uses the number to transmit a long-distance call after the registration has expired, the called telephone bureau may try to transmit it once and notify the called party to continue the registration. If the called party is unwilling to do so, future calls using the registration number will be stopped and handled as telephone calls where the called party cannot be notified. 9. If the address of the called party changes, the original telephone bureau should be notified in advance for verification. If the called party moves to another location or outside the area stipulated in Article 3, the original telephone bureau should cancel their registration number and invalidate the certificate. 10. The registration number may not be transferred to others. If the name of the called party needs to be changed, the original telephone bureau should be notified to issue a new certificate. 11. The telephone bureau does not charge any fees for handling registration and issuing and renewing certificates. 12. The application of this method is limited to calling and talking. 13. This method will be implemented from March 1, 1937.

### Whereabouts of Bang-Bang Opera Actress Bai Yushuang Unknown

Scheduled to Perform on New Year's Day, Claimed to Go to the Barber and Never Returned

Bai Yushuang, a Bang-Bang opera actress who enjoyed fame for performing seductive dramas, suddenly went missing on the 6th of this month (the 25th day of the 12th lunar month (Saturday)). Bai's family has posted missing person advertisements, and the most disappointed and directly affected is the Empire Theater in the French Concession. Details are recorded below:

Original Name Li Guizhen

Bai Yushuang's original name is Li Guizhen. She is from the North and is currently twenty-six years old. Since childhood, she has learned Bang-Bang opera from Zhu Baozia's father, Zhu Liu. It is said that when Bai was sixteen years old, she married a wealthy merchant in Tianjin and had a daughter, Xiao Ziyushuang. However, she soon divorced and returned to her old profession, performing in various ports in Tianjin and Beijing, known for her seductive performances. Among them, "Pan Jinlian," "Shooting the Little Old Woman," and "Widow Ma's Store" are her signature plays.

Forced to Come South

Beijing and Tianjin are the locations of ancient capitals, with pure customs and respect for etiquette and teaching. The plays performed by Bai were deemed by the authorities in Tianjin and Beijing to be a matter of public morals, and she was forced to stop performing. She had no choice but to come south to seek a new path. As soon as she arrived in Shanghai and unpacked her luggage, she was recruited by the Empire Theater in the French Concession. Her first performance was well-received by some people in Shanghai, and her fame soared.

Empire Theater Reform

The owner of the Empire Theater, seeing Bai's potential, transformed the original movie theater into a pure Bang-Bang opera theater. Her play "Pan Jinlian" was performed for several weeks, rivaling the popularity of previous plays such as "The Civet Cat Prince" and "The Investiture of the Gods." Zhao Ruquan, a famous Peking Opera actor, also collaborated with Bai in this play, which shows a glimpse of Bai's artistry.

Signed a Contract and Ran Away

Last summer, Bai led a troupe to perform in Hankou, and returned to Shanghai at the end of autumn, continuing to perform at her favorite place, the Empire Theater. At the end of November, Bai went to Wuxi to perform for two weeks, but at the same time, she continued to sign a contract with the Empire Theater to perform on New Year's Day. After returning to Shanghai from Wuxi, she unexpectedly ran away quietly on the 6th of this month (the 25th day of the 12th lunar month) due to family troubles.

Bai's Foster Mother Advertises

After Bai ran away, Bai's foster mother, Li Bian (from the North, 48 years old), initially hoped that Bai would return in a day or two, so she did not announce it to the outside world. It was not until New Year's Eve was approaching and she was about to perform that Bai's whereabouts remained unknown. At this point, Bai's mother explained the situation to Zhang Weitao, the manager of the Empire Theater, and posted a missing person advertisement (which has been seen in the newspapers). The words were extremely sincere, hoping to urge her to return soon. The Empire Theater was at a loss for words.

Why Run Away?

The reasons for Bai's departure are rumored to be different. Some say that Bai recently had a romantic relationship with a Mr. Li, which was broken up by her mother, Li Bian, causing this change. However, according to Li Bian, who currently lives at No. 1 Jian'an Lane, Kaizi'erni Road, a dispute arose over trivial family matters on the evening of the 5th, and Bai went out on the morning of the 6th, claiming to go to the barber, and never returned. However, the reason for Bai's departure is not worth exploring or researching. In short, no matter what, it is nothing more than a love issue.

### County's Re-Investigation of Opium Addiction Completed

After the expiration of the Shanghai County's re-investigation of opium addiction at the end of last month, it was ordered to extend for another ten days. Therefore, the county government continued to supervise the investigation and crackdown. As a result, many suspects of private addiction and relapse were found and sent to the county hospital for verification. Now, the county government, in addition to ordering the anti-opium bureau to interrogate and dispose of the opium addicts arrested during the re-investigation period separately, will also report the handling situation to the provincial office for inspection.

### Maidservant Unwilling to Return Home, Willing to Go to the Jiliang Institute

Maid Claims Repeated Abuse by Mistress, Male and Female Abductors Sent Back for Further Interrogation

Yao Jinfeng, a fourteen-year-old maidservant in the home of Jiang Wu (surname), a woman from Nanjing, at No. 15, Lane 548, Bazhi Road, suddenly disappeared at around 6:00 PM on the 28th of last month. The Hongkou Police Station was notified and sent Chinese detective Wang Runhe to investigate. It was discovered that Yu Cailang, a Changshu native who runs a job agency at No. 148, North Zhejiang Road, was involved. He was arrested and interrogated. It was learned that his mistress, Mao Qiaoian, Wuxi native, was formerly employed by Jiang Wu (surname) and resigned due to certain reasons. She held a grudge and took advantage of a gap to entice Yao (surname)

The woman out

They went together to the home of a relative with the surname Shi in Xinzhen, Chongming Second District, and hid, attempting to sell her for profit. The next morning, the suspect Yu was sent to the First Special District Court. It was ordered that he be returned to custody and the date be changed. Wang (surname) took an official letter from the court to Chongming and located the address where Mao (surname) was subsequently arrested. However, Yao (surname) had been sent to Shanghai by someone due to the emergency. First she was at the China Hotel at No. 655 Zhejiang Road. On the 5th of this month, she was told to return to the home of Jiang Wu. However, she got lost while walking through the boundary road

Crying in confusion

She was taken to the Sima Police Station by the Chinese police on duty. Because the woman refused to explain that she had been abducted, she was sent to the Jiliang Institute for temporary stay. Mao (surname) was brought to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the police, together with Yao (surname), sent Yu Cailang and Mao Qiaoian to the Criminal Third Tribunal. Labor Bureau lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the facts of the case and said that according to Mao (surname)'s confession at the police station, Yao (surname)'s departure was indeed instigated by Yu Cailang. On that day, she had a scarf left in the house of Jiang Wu and took the opportunity to take it when Yao (surname) was beaten by her for a trivial matter. She lured her out and first went to Yu (surname)'s job agency

Stayed for a night

They continued to stay at the China Hotel on Zhejiang Road for two days and discussed with Mao (surname) to take the woman to Chongming for profit. Now, the woman's employer Jiang Wu (surname) and her father Yao Beijin have all come to court, but the woman is unwilling to return to Jiang Wu (surname) or Yao Beijin. According to the woman Jinfeng, "I have been a maid in Jiang's family for about two years. At first, my mistress treated me well, but recently, if I did something wrong, I would be beaten. When I went to Jiang's family, my father went with me. The price was 60 yuan and it was stated that I would go with Mao (surname)

The course of the escape

I now wish to study at the Jiliang Institute," etc. According to Jiang Wu (surname), "Jinfeng is not a maid. At that time, her father made the decision for her to work in my house. The 60 yuan was a loan her father took out because of poverty." According to Yao Beijin, "Jinfeng is my biological daughter." The two defendants blamed each other and evaded responsibility. Judge Xiao Bianfen ordered a postponement and ordered the Jiliang Institute to submit its charter for review. Yu Cailang and Mao Qiaoian were returned to custody.

### The Case of Gong Chunpu's Involvement in the Assassination Attempt on Mr. Soong has Resulted in Arrest

The Court Approves Detention for One Week; Bail Request Denied

Wang Yaqiao, the Anhui native and leader of an assassination ring, had followers throughout the country. Their daily work consisted of assassinating central political figures and important government officials. Recently, news spread that Wang was murdered in Guilin, Guangxi. During the Republic of China Year 21, the Shanghai Municipal Council police arrested twenty-one of Wang's followers, including Long Lin, Tang Ming, Zhang Chunting, and Wei Jiayun. They were found to have a significant connection to the assassination attempt on Soong Tzu-wen and other important cases. They were handed over to the First Special District Court, which ruled on November 9 of the same year to transfer them to inland authorities for interrogation. During the trial, the suspects confessed that Gong Chunpu, also known as Duanfu (42 years old this year), from Xiangyin, Hunan, was also a key figure, equivalent in rank to Wang Yaqiao. Therefore, the police have been paying attention to the investigation, but for several years, Gong's whereabouts have remained unknown, making it impossible to bring him to justice. On February 8 this year, You A’gen, the chief Chinese detective of the Old Zha Police Station, along with detectives Pang Ruiqing and Li Shugui, learned that Gong had arrived in Shanghai and was living at 578 Baker Road. They collaborated with Western detective Mike Mau and went to the address, where they successfully arrested Gong and brought him back to the police station. On the morning of the 9th, he was escorted to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division 1. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the defendant, Gong Chunpu, had already written a detailed confession at the police station. Copies of the confessions previously made by Long Lin and others were also brought to the court by the police. However, there was still various evidence in the case that could not be verified due to time constraints. Therefore, the prosecution was temporarily suspended, and a request was made for his detention. When questioned, Gong confessed that he knew a few of Long Lin and others, and that they were Wang Yaqiao's followers. He claimed that he had just arrived in Shanghai from Peiping and was immediately arrested. He had no time to gather any evidence and requested that he be granted bail. After reviewing the confession, Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, ruled that Gong Chunpu be detained for one week for further questioning, and that the request for bail was denied.

### Sudden High Tide in Shanghai

Unabated for Three Consecutive Days

Since the morning of the Lunar New Year's Eve, there was torrential rain in Shanghai until 12:30 pm. In the afternoon, there was drizzle that stopped and started intermittently, and yesterday the weather finally cleared up. However, the weather felt even colder. Since the Lunar New Year's Day, the northeast wind has been strong, and the tide has suddenly risen. For the past two days, the tide has risen to more than 39 feet on the Customs House water gauge. The tide in Wusong Yunzaobang has reached the same level as the road. The south bank is slightly lower, and the tide has already reached the shore, turning the fields into a swamp. Sanjiashuikou is a vast expanse of water with raging waves crashing into the sky. Sailing boats have stopped operating, and the water is muddy and quite salty. Because it is the beginning of the year, people call it the "New Year's Tide." But in reality, it is because the wind is so strong that the sea tide is blowing into the river mouth, turning the freshwater salty, making it undrinkable. As a result, the price of freshwater has risen sharply, which is a great opportunity for water carriers.

### Spring Snowfall the Day Before Yesterday

Since the Spring Festival, the weather in this city has suddenly turned cold. At around 3:30 pm the day before yesterday, it suddenly snowed, followed by light rain, which stopped in the evening. The wind was very strong, and until yesterday evening, the northwest wind continued to howl, making the cold even more severe. Pedestrians on the road were all shivering.

### Twelve Stab Wounds for One Dime

Wu Aru, a Yancheng native who runs a fruit stall, was owed one dime by Sun Baoshou, a Rugao native, for a long time. So, on the Lunar New Year's Eve, he went to Sun's house at No. 12, Nan'gao Lane, Dapu Bridge Road, to ask for the debt. When he couldn't get the money, a conflict broke out at the entrance of the alley. Wu pulled out a sharp knife and stabbed Sun in the head more than a dozen times. Sun was bleeding profusely from his wounds and fell to the ground in extreme pain. Seeing that he had caused trouble, Wu ran away. The nearby police heard the commotion and arrived to intercept the suspect and recover the murder weapon. He was taken to the Ximen Branch for questioning, and the injured person was sent to the hospital for treatment.

### The Xinwei Relief Association Sends Refugees Back to Their Hometowns

The National Relief Commission Appropriates Funds to Aid Refugees in Shanghai

Xin Xin She reports that the Xinwei Relief Association in this city found that many refugees from various places were stranded in Shanghai, most of them suffering from hunger and cold and in urgent need of relief. In addition to sending a telegram to the National Relief Commission to request an appropriation of 500 yuan for refugee relief in Shanghai to purchase and distribute goods, they also distributed 600 cotton coats, 500 cotton pants, and more than 120 cotton quilts. At the same time, more than 400 refugees from the valley were sent back to their hometowns in succession.

### All Three Defendants in the Headless Trunk Murder Case are Released

After Detailed Investigation, the Police Believe There is No Need for a Third Trial Appeal

On the evening of August 11th of this year, patrol officers of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police found a rattan box on Suzhou Road near the Bund, containing the headless body of a woman. Later, Lin Gendi, who worked as a hostess at the Sincere Amusement Park, was overheard by people on Carter Road making frightening statements about murder, which caught the attention of the police. Huang Fusen, a detective from the Hongkou Police Station,

arrested her.

Under questioning, Lin confessed that the headless body in the trunk was killed on August 8th in the pavilion room at No. 3 Cunfu Lane, White Paul Road, together with fireman Mao A'gen and Jiang Yuan'tan. The deceased was named Caiying, a hostess at the Great World Company. The detectives then arrested Mao and Jiang and sent them to the First Special District Court. Jiang once confessed, but then retracted his confession, claiming that he had been tortured. Mao, on the other hand,

denied it from beginning to end.

The trial judge, Zhong Qing, and the defendant's lawyer, Fan Gang, were tireless in their pursuit of the truth (repeatedly investigating in detail), and finally discovered many doubts that did not match the facts. Therefore, Judge Zhong announced that Lin and the other two were not guilty. The Shanghai Municipal Council Police refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Second High Court. After two trials, the High Court rejected the appeal. At that time, the police lawyer, Gan Jingxian, requested that Lin and others be temporarily detained during the third trial appeal period.

for consideration

as to whether a third appeal should be filed. The judge approved it. After carefully studying the judgments of the first and second trials, Mr. Gan determined that there was no need to file a third appeal. He then declared to the Second High Court that he was abandoning the appeal and requested that Lin and others be released. The High Court immediately issued a release order and sent it to the prison. On the morning of Lunar New Year's Eve, Lin, Mao, and Jiang were finally freed, but they had already endured more than three months in prison.

Zhang Qingniang Suffers Burns

At around 11:30 pm last night, a fire broke out in a thatched hut without a signboard on the west end of the Third Civilian Village on Jiaotong Road, Zhabei, immediately breaking through the roof and spreading to neighboring houses. The Zhabei Fire Brigade rushed to the scene with belt-driven fire engines and extinguished the fire after an hour. As a result, seven or eight thatched huts were burned down.

### Four Robbers Rob Gong's Home, Stabbing with Knives and Firing Guns

Gong Shun'song's Home in Tanziwan Robbed; Lin Sheng and His Brother Injured While Wrestling with the Robbers

Gong Shun'song, a local resident, lives in a bungalow in Gongjiazhai, Tanziwan, Zhabei. He makes a living by renting out vehicles and has a small amount of savings. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon at around 7:00 pm, he was targeted by robbers. At that time, one of the four robbers carried a gun, and the other three carried sharp knives. After entering the house, they threatened the men and women inside, forbidding them to move, and demanded silver and cash. However, there was no large amount of savings in the house, and they only got about thirty yuan. The robbers were still not satisfied, so they opened the wardrobe and saw two fur coats inside, which they grabbed and fled with. At this time, Gong's two sons, Lin Sheng, 35, and Changgen, 17, saw the robbers leaving the house and chased them out. Taking advantage of the robbers' unpreparedness, they rushed forward and wrestled two of the robbers, shouting, "Catch the robbers!" In desperation, the two robbers stabbed the brothers' hands, legs, and feet with their sharp knives. However, Lin Sheng and others still held on firmly. Then the robbers fired two shots at Lin Sheng and Changgen, hitting their right thigh, causing them to fall to the ground in pain. Only then did the robbers break free. Fortunately, the police station in charge had received a report and dispatched police to the scene. They captured one of the robbers carrying a knife and immediately took him to the police station. After questioning, he confessed the whereabouts of his accomplices. The police station then dispatched detectives to pursue the remaining robbers and have arrested them. They are being detained temporarily, pending a written report to the General Bureau for investigation. The injured Gong brothers were also sent to Renji Hospital by the police station for treatment. Fortunately, the knife and gunshot wounds they sustained were not serious and should not cause any major problems.

### The Reason for the True Perpetrator of the Xue Mairuo Robbery Case Surrendering Himself

Huang Xixiang and Others Decide to Surrender; Prison Warden Notifies the Shanghai Municipal Council Police

Zhou Jinggeng, the comprador of the Xue Mairuo Accounting Firm at No. 9 Avenue Edward VII, French Concession, sent someone to the China Industrial Bank on the afternoon of June 9, 1934, to withdraw 18,000 yuan in new banknotes, to be used for the dog racing at the Yiyuan racecourse in the evening. At around 4:00 pm, the person who withdrew the money returned to the firm. A few minutes later, four robbers armed with weapons broke in and stole 12,000 yuan. After the victim reported to the French police, it involved Zhang Zuming (shareholder of the Rui Yu Shun Hardware Store on Broadway Road), Zhuang Jimeng (owner of Zhuang Yuan Hardware Store in Hongkou), Wang Lianyou (hardware store street vendor), and Tang Qingyue (dean of Dade Hospital on Gordon Road), all four being Ningbo natives, and a Taicang native. Gao Yushu, the victim's servant, and others identified them as the robbers. The French Concession Police Department filed a public prosecution with the Special Court on charges of robbery. The trial resulted in the acquittal of the four defendants due to lack of evidence of guilt. The Police Department disagreed and repeatedly appealed to the Third High Court and the Supreme Court, which, after three trials, upheld the original judgment. Lawyer Yan Luqing was also implicated for extorting money from the families of Zhang, Zhuang, and Tang, which led to a defendant reporting him. He was sentenced to two and a half years in prison and fined 800 yuan, which he is currently serving. Later, Zhuang Jimeng sued Zhang Zuming for perjury and false accusation, and Zhang Zuming sued Zhou Jinggeng, Gao Yushu, Feng Ti'e, Wan Guiying, Qian Guihua, Wang Agui, and others for perjury and false accusation. The Second Special Court ruled that all were not guilty. The case caused a sensation at the time. Various circumstances were repeatedly reported in previous newspapers. Now, the real robbers in the case have been arrested, and the details are as follows: This case was actually committed by Shen Fugui (from Taizhou), who was at large, in collusion with Huang Aying, Huang Xixiang, Wang Zhengji, and Fang Jingui, all natives of Ningbo, and five people from Hangzhou. They split the loot. Shen used 6,000 yuan, Huang Aying got 1,500 yuan, and the others got 1,000 yuan each. They also distributed money to their followers and fled in different directions. In September of last year, Huang, Huang, Wang, and Fang also robbed three shops, including the Shaanxi Bank at No. 49 Huangpu Bund, French Concession. After spending all the money, the four, in collusion with Pan Weisheng and five others, robbed three Qian Zhuang shops, Yuanheng, Shikang, and Baoshen, in the Public Concession. Pan opened fire and killed the victim's servant. The Shanghai Municipal Council Police arrested them all and sent them to the First Special District Court for prosecution. Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Division tried the case and sentenced Pan Weisheng to death on November 30, Huang Aying to 18 years in prison, Huang Xixiang to 14 years in prison, Wang Zhengji to 12 years in prison, and Fang Jingui to 10 years in prison. The judgments were final, and they were sent to prison to serve their sentences. Huang Aying learned in prison that Shen Fugui, the leader in the Xue Mairuo case, had returned to Shanghai and was living in the Xinling Village on Caishi Road, French Concession. Fearing that Shen Fugui would be arrested and confess to their involvement, which would increase their sentences and leave them with no chance of being released from prison, he confessed with his accomplices Huang Xixiang, Wang Zhengji, and Fang Jingui, hoping for a reduced sentence. They decided to confess to the warden of the Tilanqiao Prison that they had committed robberies in the French Concession, including the Xue Mairuo case and the Shaanxi Bank case, and asked for verification. The warden informed the Shanghai Municipal Council Police, who informed the French Concession Police and requested the Second Special Court to dispatch inspectors Jiang Futian and Li Xianyang, and detective Zhou Ruzhang, on the 8th of this month to the First Special Court to transfer the four robbers, Huang Aying, Huang Xixiang, Wang Zhengji, and Fang Jingui, back to the case. The next day, they were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Gu Shouxi, the lawyer for the Shanghai Municipal Council Police, stated the facts of the case and requested a postponement of two weeks for investigation before filing charges. When questioned, the four defendants confessed to committing two robbery cases. Wang and Fang did not go to the Shaanxi Bank case and only each received 50 yuan. The court verified the confessions and decided to postpone the interrogation to the 26th. The defendants were returned to custody. Huang Aying's appearance closely resembled Zhang Zuming, who was identified by the victim's partner, Gao Yushu. Huang Aying was passing by his friend's car shop on Guangxi Road when Gao Yushu saw him. Zhang Zuming happened to be going to the car shop to hire a car at that time. Huang Aying noticed that Gao Yushu was following him and fled into the crowd, causing Gao to mistake Zhang Zuming for the robber and report him to the police for arrest, resulting in a sensational miscarriage of justice. The injustice suffered by Zhang and others has now been cleared, but it has caused hardship for the victim, Zhou Jinggeng, and the lawyer, Yan Luqing. Zhang Zuming's lawsuit against Zhou and others for perjury and false accusation is still under appeal, and it is unknown when this lawsuit will end.

### Male Corpse Found Murdered on Bansongyuan Road

Chu Heshang, who lives in Deren Chongguan Lane on Bansongyuan Road in the Nanshi area, suddenly discovered an unknown male corpse on the pedestrian path at the entrance of the lane at around 6:00 am yesterday morning. The deceased was about 30 years old, bald, barefoot, without clothing on his upper body, and wearing black cloth pants on his lower body.

### Sheng Sheng Hospital Solves the Difficulty of Childbirth

Qu Shaoheng's Compassionate Heart - Worthy of Attention by Common People

Childbirth is a dangerous matter for women, yet many are mistaken about the timing. Otherwise, with proper obstetrical assistance, there should be no risk to life. Dr. Qu Shaoheng, the superintendent of Sheng Sheng Hospital on Route Sapoise in the French Concession, has devoted himself to the study of obstetrics and gynecology, and does not hesitate to travel to the countryside. On the 3rd of this month, at 1:00 PM, Mrs. Chen Shi of Chen Family Alley, east end of Yangjia Town, Pudong, had a difficult childbirth. Due to postpartum complications, she was invited to the hospital at 1:40 PM, but the parturient was beyond saving. It turned out that she had felt labor pains at 11:30 PM on the previous night and hired a midwife. At 9:30 AM, she delivered a healthy boy, and the whole family rejoiced. Initially, the parturient was quite pleased with herself, but due to improper postpartum care, she became dizzy and lost consciousness, eventually losing her life. This was purely due to not seeking treatment early enough. On the 9th of the same month, at 11:50 AM, a woman from the Xu family residence in Lu Family Alley, southeast of the Old City God Temple in Pudong, was having a twin breech birth. The midwife managed to deliver one child, but it was stillborn. Soon after, another child's hand was seen, causing great alarm. Midwife Qu Duizhen was invited to examine her and said it was a transverse presentation and had been too long. The child was already dead, and only an expert physician could save the mother's life. The Xu family then entrusted the upper-level company to telegraph Dr. Qu to come. He removed the child and saved the mother. According to him, this kind of breech presentation would not have been a problem if handled earlier. The 11th was the Lunar New Year's Day. A woman surnamed Gu was in labor and invited Dr. Qu's wife, Yao Ying, a female doctor, to come. The child had already fallen into the toilet, and the parturient was bleeding and dizzy. Yao, rich in experience, held the parturient with one hand and lifted the baby from the toilet with the other. Then, with the help of family members, she carefully moved her to the bed, slowly removed the afterbirth, and promptly injected the parturient with a hemostatic injection. Subsequently, the assistant held the baby and further removed the fecal water and blood from the trachea. As a result, both lives were saved. It is said that in childbirth, as long as preparations are made early and the timing is not missed, it can be said there is no danger. Dr. Qu especially hopes that the poor can stay in the hospital and receive civilian treatment, because poor families often face inconvenience in a hurry, but once admitted to the hospital, everything is convenient, and the daily fee is only thirty cents.

### The Datong Hospital Abortion Case is Postponed

Li Wengui, a native of Shaoxing, is forty-six years old this year. He married Li Jingzhen (25 years old), a woman from Shanghai, as his second wife in Shanghai, living at No. 97, Yongyu Lane, Route Belles in the French Concession. Wengui has been engaged in business in Tianjin and spends most of his time there. Jingzhen, living in Shanghai, could not bear to sleep alone and had an affair with Shen Fusheng, renting another small house at No. 673, Route Belles. Recently, Jingzhen became pregnant, already four months along. Fearing that she would be ashamed in front of her husband when she gave birth, she had the idea of having an abortion. On the 4th of this month, at 4:00 PM, Jingzhen told her maid, Chu Zhangshi (49 years old, a native of Nanxun), that she had business to attend to in Suzhou and would return in a week, instructing her to take care of the housework and the children. She then went to the small house with her girlfriend, Xue Kebin (21 years old, a native of Shanghai, residing at No. 1, Tengfeng Lane, Baiyi Street, inside the Old North Gate). They invited the landlord, Mrs. Hu Chen, and the maternal uncle of her lover, Shen Fusheng (name unknown), to accompany her to Datong Gynecology Hospital for an abortion. By 8:30 AM on the 5th, she had died. The hospital notified the deceased's family. The maid, Chu Zhangshi, reported to the French Concession police on the afternoon of the 6th that the hospital had performed an abortion without reporting to the police beforehand or afterward, which violated regulations and was inhumane. The police arrested the doctor, Gu Shaocen, Xue Kebin, and others and sent the corpse to the Tongren Fuyuan branch for an autopsy. On the 8th, they reported to the chief prosecutor of the Second Special Court, Jiang Zhuan, and the forensic officer, who dissected the lower part of the deceased and verified that the deceased had indeed died from an abortion. After interrogating the defendants and witnesses Chu Zhangshi, Hu Chenmin, Xia Chenshi, etc., they ordered the corpse to be claimed by the deceased's brother, Li Wende, for burial. The defendants were handed over by the police department. After the autopsy, the police sent the defendants to the Second Special Court, where Judge Chen Shuoying presided over the First Criminal Court. The police department's lawyer was questioned and requested a postponement of the investigation before prosecuting. The interrogation was strict. The doctor claimed that the deceased had had an abortion elsewhere and came to his clinic for treatment because the placenta had not been expelled and that he had not performed the abortion. Dr. Gu denied helping with the abortion, and Xue also denied introducing the hospital, only admitting to accompanying her, etc. The court ordered a postponement until the morning of the 15th (tomorrow) for another hearing. The defendants were remanded in custody.

### First Shanghai-Hong Kong Chinese Intercity Football Match Today

Shanghai Team Went to Hong Kong on the 9th for Three Matches

Hong Kong, 13th - After the East China football team arrived in Hong Kong on the 11th, they watched the Shanghai-Hong Kong match on the 13th and attended the regional match on the 14th. The Physical Education Association hosted a banquet at 7:00 PM. On the 15th, they watched the Shanghai vs. Military Alliance match and attended a dinner hosted by the Chinese Swimming Association. On the 16th, they took a bus tour around the New Territories. On the 17th, they played against the Hong Kong United team and attended a dinner hosted by the South China Athletic Association. The first Shanghai-Hong Kong Chinese intercity football match is scheduled to take place in Hong Kong today. The Shanghai team traveled south on the 9th, led by Jiang Xiangqing, the representative of the National Sports Association, coach Rong Qizhao, and manager Yu Hengzhi. According to Mr. Jiang, this competition is not a resumption of the previous regional competitions. Some years ago, there were so-called Li Xishen Cup regional football competitions, but because the National Games also included a football championship, the regional competitions were no longer necessary and were discontinued midway. This time, the Hong Kong Chinese Amateur Sports Federation initiated the Hong Kong-Shanghai Chinese football match, which was approved by the National Sports Promotion Association. Therefore, this competition in Hong Kong should be called the first Hong Kong-Shanghai Chinese intercity football match. It is understood that the Shanghai team will play a total of three games in Hong Kong. Today is the official match. On the 17th, they will play against the Hong Kong Military Alliance, and on the 21st, they will play against the Guangdong-Hong Kong United team, both of which are friendly matches. After the matches, they will take the Asia Queen liner back to Shanghai.

### Overturning All Predictions, Shanghai Intercity Team Defeats Hong Kong Team

Shanghai Team's Offense is Extremely Strong, Winning Three Goals in the First Half - The Overall Result is Four to Three. Hong Kong Team's Performance is Abnormal. The Shanghai Team Also Defeats the China United Team Yesterday

Hong Kong, 13th (Special Dispatch) - The Shanghai football team played against the Hong Kong Chinese United team at Caroline Hill on the afternoon of the 13th. China United reserved its strength in preparation for the regional football match on the 14th, so it only sent young and strong players to play. The crowd watching was no smaller than on the day of the intercity match. The Shanghai team won 4-1. The team is scheduled to watch the East China-South China regional match on the 14th, play against the Hong Kong Military Alliance on the 15th, and have a banquet at the Hong Kong Hotel. They will rest on the 16th, take a car tour around Hong Kong Island on the 17th, and take the Iron Company's Narudana liner back to Shanghai on the 18th.

Hong Kong, 11th (Reuters) - The annual Shanghai-Hong Kong intercity football match was held here today. The Shanghai team overturned all predictions, played with all their strength, and defeated the Hong Kong team. The result was four to three.

Before the match, the Shanghai team thought they had little chance of winning against the strong Hong Kong team. However, the Shanghai team's performance was exceptionally good, making the most of all available opportunities. Their victory was the result it should have been.

Foon, the right wing of the Shanghai team, scored two of the four goals. Jem Watts and Laubasstoff each scored one.

On the Hong Kong side, star player Li Huitang scored once, once with a penalty kick, and Wilson scored the other goal.

The last few minutes of the match were full of thrills. The Hong Kong team did its best to counterattack fiercely, hoping to tie the game. The Shanghai team's victory today also won back the lost Telegraph Cup. The lineups of both sides were as follows.

Winning the First Goal - The Hong Kong team kicked off first, but failed to take advantage. Shanghai advanced aggressively, its momentum formidable. The Hong Kong side counterattacked, approaching the goal. Ma Shanger kicked the ball out. The ball circled around, and Laubasstoff finally got a chance to send the ball into the net, opening the scoring.

Winning the Second Goal - The Shanghai team was greatly excited and continued to attack the Hong Kong goal. Jem Watts received a brilliant pass from his brother Jack and shot the ball against the crossbar, bouncing down and in. Shanghai led 2-0.

Winning the Third Goal - The Hong Kong team showed some vitality after this setback, but because they were eager to win, they repeatedly missed opportunities. Before the end of the first half, Foon charged into the net with the ball, and Bao Jiaping was unable to save it.

Losing Two Goals - The Hong Kong team was greatly stimulated by this heavy blow and became lively. In the second minute of the second half, Li Huitang shot in a fast, low ball. After this goal, Wilson followed up with another shot. The ball was shot fiercely by Yang Shuiyi, and the ball rebounded off the foot of a Shanghai defender. Wilson got it and scored.

Winning the Fourth Goal - The Shanghai team regained momentum. Foon received a pass from Bao Xiutuo and sent the ball in, expanding the Shanghai team's score to 4-2.

Losing the Third Goal - The Hong Kong side counterattacked desperately, circling in the Shanghai half for a long time, but ultimately failed to score. Unexpectedly, at the Shanghai goal, Boringai collided with Li Huitang, and Li Huitang was awarded a penalty kick.

Maintaining the Lead - In the last few minutes, the Shanghai team did its best to maintain this one-goal lead. Li Huitang had an excellent opportunity a few yards from the goal, but he shot a wild ball, which was a great pity.

### Beijing Amateur Basketball Team Wins One and Loses Two in Shanghai

First Wins Against the Xin Team, Then Loses to Xintong - Tang Liu's Skills are Far Not as Good as Before

The Beijing Amateur Basketball Team, formerly known as the Tianjin Lianghua Basketball Team, came to Shanghai at the end of the Lunar Year. Starting on New Year's Day, they played three consecutive games in Shanghai. On the 11th, they defeated the Xin team 60-30 in the first game. The night before, in the second game against Xintong, they lost by four points, 40-44. Last night, they played Xintong again and were defeated 28-48. The details of the three games are summarized as follows. The team will return to Beijing today.

First Game - The amateur team is not as elite as it was in the Lianghua era. They prioritize defense over offense. The two guards, Zhang and Yin, are as solid as gold. Among the forwards, Li Zhenzhong is naturally a pillar. Tang and Liu are not as good as before and lack the sharpness of the Lianghua era. The reserves are also far inferior. But they are more than capable of dealing with the Xin team. In this game, the Xin team took the lead in the first ten minutes. Lu Zhangan committed his third foul, which put a major constraint on the Xin team. The amateur team took the opportunity to launch a major offensive. At 22-16, Lu committed his fourth foul and was sent off. The Xin team's situation deteriorated. The amateur team led 31-19 in the first half. At the start of the second half, the amateur team's momentum was even greater. However, both sides committed more fouls. At 33-23, Zhou Dayun was also sent off. At 40-26, Tang Shikun was injured in the leg and left the game. In the last minute, Li Zhenzhong also committed his fourth foul and was sent off. In an instant, the game ended, and the amateur team won 60-30.

Second Game - In the second game on the evening of the 12th, against Xintong, the amateur team overcame many difficulties and surpassed Xintong three times in the second half. Unfortunately, they still lost 40-44. Xintong led 19-16 in the first half. Xintong's strength is very strong. In addition to the original players, they also added Mai Lingzhi, Locke, and the guard Phihes of the American All-Star Basketball Team. Therefore, it was not easy for the amateur team to achieve this result. In the first fifteen minutes of this game, Xintong was invincible and led 12-3. At this point, the amateur team gradually improved and worked hard to catch up, narrowing the gap to 16-18. The first half ended 16-19. In the second half, the situation was unpredictable. Tang, Liu, and Li's swish shots scored repeatedly, and the amateur team surpassed Xintong for the first time at 26-25. Although Zhang Jingshi committed his fourth foul and was sent off, the amateur team led 30-28 for the second time. Unexpectedly, at 34-29, Xintong scored nine consecutive points, and Xintong took the lead again. However, after the guard Phihes committed his fourth foul and was sent off, the amateur team, with the efforts of Liu and Sun, led Xintong for the third time at 39-38. Unfortunately, in the last three minutes, Locke scored repeatedly, and the amateur team lost 40-44.

Third Game - Last night, the amateur team played Xintong again at Shenyuan and suffered a major defeat of 28-48. They trailed 15-17 in the first half by two points. After two nights of consecutive battles, the amateur team showed signs of exhaustion in the second half last night and could not resist Xintong's new forces, finally becoming unable to recover. In the first half, the amateur team played extremely well and seemed likely to take revenge. They led 13-6, but Locke and Lein gradually caught up and tied the game, with Xintong leading by two points at 15-17. In the second half, Wu Bixian replaced Zhang Jingshi, and Li retreated to the guard position. They lost six consecutive points, and the gap widened. At 22-31, Sun Huipei replaced Li Zhenzhong, and the situation became even worse at 24-39. Zhang Jingshi committed his fourth foul and was sent off, and the outcome was already predetermined. At 44-24, although Lein was also sent off, it could not change the situation. The final score was 28-48. In the second half, Phihes, Carson, and the others from Xintong were courageous and formidable, and they were truly a formidable team. The amateur team was in a bitter battle, and the different physical conditions and rest situations made the defeat not a crime of war.

### Commercial and Industrial Circles Show Signs of Joy, Celebrating the New Year and Wishing Prosperity

A phenomenon rarely seen in the past five years, but actual development still awaits; The fifth day of the Lunar New Year coincides with “Gold Danger Danger”; to prosper, one must still rely on one’s own efforts

Last year was the first year in nearly five years that various industries in Shanghai saw the most improvement, especially in the second half of the year, which showed signs of prosperity. The improvement in market prices last year started with oil cakes and miscellaneous grains, followed by flour, wheat, yarn, and cotton. In the second half of the year, the sales of cloth were temporarily prosperous, which made the rise in cotton yarn unstoppable, and all cotton textiles also rose in price. In addition, Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other places almost always purchased Xun rice and other japonica rice throughout the year, and the rice price became more expensive even when new rice came out. Beans, wheat, and sesame were also expensive. It is said that except for a few people in the rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, and oil cake industries who made mistakes in their judgment and occasionally failed, none of them made less than a threefold profit. Just looking at the small section of Bean Market Street, brokers made profits of more than two million yuan. Other grain brokers and rice shops in Zhabei Hexia are not included. From this, we can get a general idea of the rest. As for the banks, bad debts have gradually decreased, and their operations are prudent, so profits can be secured. Even with savings bonus deposits, there are still more than 8% interest. Bank dividends are also mostly paid out before the old accounting period, which shows the abundance of funds. However, since the implementation of legal tender, banks no longer have the ability to give and take as they did in the era of issuing their own banknotes. Therefore, the most abundant profits are naturally those with the power to issue banknotes. The cotton yarn industry has naturally made profits with the step-by-step increase in yarn prices last year. The generous dividends of the yarn and cloth exchange can prove the profitability of the yarn industry. The cotton cloth industry also shouted "overturned" and "earned overturned," making so much money that they could not bear it and overturned, not because of business failure. However, after the price of cloth rose, there was a temporary decline, and the hidden losses were not small. The shipping industry benefited from the continuous transportation of rice, flour, yarn, and cloth in large quantities from the north. After the second half of the year, the Guangdong Bureau was unified, and foreign rice was taxed, so transportation to the south was also strong. Whether it was Taikoo or China Merchants, the profit was millions. Customs brokers who did business in the north also benefited. Even small customs brokers who reported grain made a lot of profit. Since the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the business of the transshipment industry has also expanded considerably. Although the gold and silver industry had fixed gold prices, it was not easy to make profits. However, Shanghai is still a major port, and although gold prices are expensive, buyers continue to buy. Labor costs are rising, and expenses are still high. Moreover, the price of silver has increased from 1.5 yuan to 1.75 yuan per tael. Silverware made of 80% silver costs 2.4 yuan per tael, including labor costs, or at least 2.1 to 2.2 yuan. The interest rate is much higher than usual, so it can be maintained without being worn out. The business of the Gold Exchange is not comparable to that of 1935. Replacing it are the Yarn, Cloth, Miscellaneous Grains, and Flour Exchanges. Whether they are shareholders or members, they are all overjoyed. The Miscellaneous Grains Exchange has even allocated 100,000 yuan to build a new market. After the listing of unified government bonds, the Securities Exchange has seen trading return from brilliance to plainness, but it is still in a small well-off situation. The silk and tea industries are also good. The sales of silk and satin clothing stores are particularly strong. Pawnbrokers found it difficult to clear the goods that were full of goods and reduced in price the year before last. Last year, they sold full and bought with additional profits, still fighting over each other. The foreign paper industry had an especially good encounter. They placed orders in the first half of the year and made a big profit in the second half of the year. Moreover, there was often no supply to meet the demand. Non-wholesale retailers all had to worry about not having goods. Therefore, the paper industry in this year all regretted ordering too little in the previous year. In addition, retail daily necessities stores have been touched by the rise in prices. However, since general purchasing power has not recovered and the unemployment problem has not been resolved, they have not made healthy progress. However, at the end of last year, all the inns and hotels were full, unlike the previous year when they offered 70% or 80% discounts and gave away one day for every day of stay, with no one caring. This can be seen as a sign of commercial benefit, because merchants often borrow hotels at the end and beginning of the year as a place for entertainment, and also solicit customers to promote business. Therefore, this year, when the commercial and industrial circles meet, they congratulate each other with "Congratulations on getting rich," with happy faces, unlike the previous year when they said the same thing, but their faces still had hesitation.

In general, those who bought into the upward market last year all made profits, while those who sold out inevitably missed the opportunity. In fact, the improvement of the market was due to the prosperity of the world's military industry and the advancement of national defense equipment, and China, which supplies the world with raw materials, has benefited from the residue. Secondly, the domestic consecutive years of famine were followed by a bumper harvest last year, which coincided with the urgent need for raw materials overseas, and the farmers, who had been exhausted for a long time, needed to supplement their needs, which led to a sudden increase in temporary needs. Thirdly, from the observation of retail business, the real purchasing power has not yet recovered, so the rise in prices seems to be due to the devaluation of the currency. As for this year's industry and commerce, inheriting the rising momentum of the past year, if there are no unexpected attacks, profits can be secured. There is a rumor in the market that this year's fifth day of the Lunar New Year coincides with the ancient saying "Gold Danger Danger." "Gold Danger Danger" please the God of Wealth, great profit, and the custom is based on the old first fourth night of the Lunar New Year please the God of Wealth, the fifth day to open the market. This year coincides with "Gold Danger Danger," so some merchants regard "The God of Wealth is in China this year" as a material for congratulating each other in the New Year (Note: There are two days of Gold Danger Danger this year, one is the fifth day of the first lunar month, and the other is April 29). Saying that it involves superstition is not worth taking, but we must know that Chinese industry and commerce have reached this point, and good fortune cannot solve the problem of getting rich. If you really want to get rich, you must take out your real skills and all your spirit; come out and deal with people, not only must the material be improved, but the spirit must also be transformed, otherwise even if there is a "God of Wealth," they will be unable to help.

### Yarn and Cotton

The cotton yarn market turns around, all thanks to winter

The actual sales of cotton yarn in 1936 were better than last year, but the purchasing power of all parties in the first half of the year was still sluggish, and the factories still had concerns about overproduction. Although the financial sector once searched in the yarn market, the market price rose, but the actual needs always had no signs of development, so the market conditions soon fell again. Later, in the autumn, because the whole country had abundant cotton and rice harvests, cloth began to be active first. Since cloth sales were smooth, yarn, which is a necessary raw material, improved accordingly. As for the yarn factories, in mid-July and August, because cotton was in the transition period between the old and new crops, some parties manipulated it with particular force, and the market price was raised to 52.5 yuan. The rise in cotton prices exceeded that of cloth, and yarn factories increased their shutdowns and reduced their work, and some were completely closed. Hankou also suffered from the same disease. 500,000 spindles of yarn and thread in Tianjin, North China, were purchased by Japanese merchants. The production volume was greatly reduced, and the inventory of yarn in Shanghai gradually decreased, shrinking from 80,000 bales to 23,000 bales. At this time, autumn sales began, and the factories suffered from a lack of yarn supply. The yarn in the exchange's warehouse became the object of competition for purchase by the Ke Bangs. Before long, the 30,000 bales of yarn were sold out, which shows the magnitude of the Ke Bangs' intake. The market almost became a situation where no yarn could be purchased, so they went a step further and purchased futures. Shenxin, Wing On, and other factories sold off more and more. Production could not meet demand. The yarn houses were eager for spot goods and had to advance silver to the factories to distribute stack soldiers. After October, the rising trend of yarn prices became more and more dramatic, from 230 yuan to 40 yuan, reaching outside 50 yuan. The phenomenon of customers paying for stack orders further proves the smooth sales of spot goods. As a result, the spot price of yarn in the market and the price of stack orders differed by as much as 10 to 20 yuan per piece. In fact, the yarn industry had been declining for five years, and the rural areas had been declining for years, and the cloth and yarn inventories in all areas had become increasingly exhausted. In the spring of 1935, the highest recorded inventory of yarn reached over 160,000 bales. Later, after the national government announced its currency reform policy, the financial situation stabilized. Now, thanks to the abundant harvest throughout the country, the purchasing power of the rural areas has been healthy, and the market situation that had been feared for several years has suddenly recovered. It is found that the total amount of spot yarn purchased by various Ke Bangs throughout the year was 363,250 bales, an increase of 56,299 bales compared to the 300,3951 bales of the previous year. Among them, the inland Ke Bangs purchased particularly strongly. Due to the smooth trade in cloth, the military unification of the two Guangs, and the demand for cloth in the southern corner, the intake was particularly strong. Therefore, the small cloth factories in Xichangcheng and other areas made a lot of profits. The total amount of spot yarn purchased throughout the year was 115,813 bales, more than double that of the previous year. Jiangsi Bang entered 51,060 bales, an increase of 28,910 bales. Tianjin Bang entered 36,045 bales, an increase of 23,920 bales. Only Guangdong Bang entered 60,793 bales, a decrease of 15,125 bales. It is found that the turnover in January was 22,130 bales, the turnover in February was 35,634 bales, the turnover in March was 32,531 bales, the turnover in April was 19,312 bales, the turnover in May was 22,635 bales, the turnover in June was 26,170 bales, the turnover in July was 19,630 bales, the turnover in August was 44,831 bales, the turnover in September was 47,642 bales, the turnover in October was 41,005 bales, the turnover in November was 32,225 bales, and the turnover in December was 185,500 bales, totaling 363,250 bales. The following is a list of the annual and previous year's purchases of each Bang (unit: bales):

In the spring and autumn, the standard cotton yarn market price hovered around the 200 yuan mark. Later, after the announcement of the Sino-US Monetary Agreement in May, it broke through the 200 yuan mark, reaching 193 yuan. At this time, there were often 30,000 bales of warehouse yarn, and the yarn market was under heavy pressure. Following this, the incident of Japanese residents being killed in China caused diplomatic tensions to intensify, and the market showed signs of unrest again. In addition, the acreage of cotton fields increased sharply throughout the country this year, and another bumper harvest was reported. The US cotton estimates released on August 8 were also higher than expected. Foreign raw materials showed signs of oversupply, and the decline in US cotton put more pressure on the yarn market. However, after October, due to the improvement in rural areas and the active trade in cloth from all directions, the sales of cotton yarn raw materials suddenly increased dramatically, and market prices soared, with two limit-up days. The sharpness of the surge was unprecedented in more than ten years. New peaks appeared one after another. At the same time, the Osaka Sanpin Yarn also created a top peak of 300 yuan. On November 5, it once again created a new record of 268 yuan since 1918. At the same time, the price of 20-count spot yarn soared by 15-16 yuan in one day, and the thread jumped by more than 20 yuan. The price even reached its peak. The business of the exchange developed greatly, and the turnover exceeded 1.5 times that of the previous year. The following is a table listing the highest and lowest prices and total turnover and delivery prices of the Standard Yarn throughout the year for reference:

Overseas Cotton Market During the Holiday

On the 6th (Saturday), the US cotton market opened with sluggish market conditions. Prices fell by 3-4 points in each month due to cotton farmers taking profits and bulls closing positions. Washington's intentions were uncertain. Afterwards, industry insiders bought heavily, and the market conditions reacted. However, profit-taking was very strong. It is rumored that Washington plans to purchase one million bales of non-deliverable cotton to alleviate the flood, and it is also rumored that 50,000 to 70,000 bales of cotton have been sold. The market closed firmly, with spot prices up one point and futures prices down one point to up three points. British cotton spot prices fell three points and futures prices fell one to two points. Sentiment in the Indian cotton market improved, but it was met with profit-taking. Later, due to the strength of the stock market and other commodities, market prices rose. Pingguoer rose 0.25 rupee, Omra was unchanged, and Bairoxi rose 0.25 to 0.5 rupee.

On the 8th (Monday), the US cotton market opened with firm market conditions. Except for the March contract, which fell six points due to overseas bulls closing positions, the remaining months rose two to eight points due to purchases by brokers and foreign merchants. Afterwards, old cotton was sold by cotton farmers, and market prices softened. New cotton buying was strong and continued to rise. The German goods exchange program is nearing completion, and trading is very smooth. The market closed steadily, with spot prices down five points, old cotton down two to five points, and new cotton up five to eleven points. British cotton spot prices rose three points and futures prices rose one point. Indian cotton rose initially on news that the US government would purchase one million bales of cotton to alleviate the flood, but then weakened due to the fall in Japanese yarn. Pingguoer fell one rupee, Omra fell 0.75 rupee, and Bairoxi rose 0.25 rupee.

On the 9th (Monday), the US cotton market opened with mixed market conditions, with each month falling one point to rising two points. In the early morning, bulls moved to the distant months, and cotton farmers sold the near months, and the market conditions were sluggish. Fortunately, industry insiders bought on the dip and were able to stand firm. The distant months were only increased by 10% due to the cotton fields, and there were not many sellers. Foreign merchants absorbed a lot, and the market always maintained a strong momentum. Then, the bulls closed positions and slightly weakened. At the close, it was heard that the west was too dry, and the government continued to manage, and the distant month's trading sentiment was very strong. Spot prices were unchanged and futures prices ranged from unchanged to up six points. British cotton spot and futures prices fell five points. Indian cotton was sold by short positions, but industry insiders bought in and Sanpin was strong. Later, old bulls sold off and the stock market was sluggish, and market prices fell slightly. Pingguoer fell 1.5 to 2 rupees, Omra fell 1.5 rupees, and Bairoxi fell 1.5 to 1.75 rupees.

On the 10th (Wednesday), the US cotton market opened with weak market conditions, with each month falling one to three points. In the early morning, the market conditions were sluggish, and the fluctuations were narrow. The main reasons for the price decline were the closing of positions by overnight bulls and small-scale short sales. Foreign merchants sold old cotton and bought new cotton. Afterwards, the wheat market and the stock market were strong, and industry insiders and short sellers bought in, and the market price rebounded. However, no one followed the buyers, and it eventually trended downward again due to the closing of positions and short sales by old bulls. New customers were lacking, and industry insiders watched. The market closed steadily, with spot prices down five points and futures prices down two to five points. British cotton spot prices fell two points and futures prices rose two to three points. Indian cotton fell initially due to the sluggish stock market and the closing of positions by old bulls, and then rebounded due to short covering. Pingguoer fell half a rupee, Omra fell 0.75 rupee, and Bairoxi fell one rupee.

On the 11th (Thursday), the US cotton market opened, and the cloth conditions were firm and strong, with prices rising three to eight points. The resolution of the automobile workers' strike and the good news from Liverpool did not affect the market. Only the industry insiders bought old cotton, and some foreign merchants needed it, and the market price rose gradually. According to reports from Washington, the cotton rollover shown in the proposed management plan cannot be said to be a large increase in production. However, the new cotton in the long term was not noticed. At the close, industry insiders bought in at a limit price, and the market trend was still firm. Spot prices rose six points, and futures prices rose three to seven points. British cotton spot prices rose seven points, and futures prices rose one to two points. The weather in the Gorak Cotton area of Indian cotton was uncertain, and short covering met with a small amount of selling. Later, it was firm due to the resolution of the automobile workers' strike in the United States. Pingguoer rose one rupee, Omra rose one to 1.25 rupees, and Bairoxi rose 1.25 rupees.

On the 12th (Friday), the US cotton market was closed, and only the New Orleans cotton market was open, with each month falling two to five points. British cotton spot prices fell two points and futures prices rose one to two points. Indian cotton bulls continued to close positions. Later, some buyers bought Indian cotton to offset the sales in Liverpool, and the market conditions became stable. Pingguoer rose 0.5 to 0.75 rupee, Omra fell 1.25 rupees, and Bairoxi fell 0.75 to 1 rupee.

Osaka Electric Sanpin, ten-period yarn, each month is lower than the previous issue by 50 cents to 3 yuan, the near month is 250 yuan and 40 cents, the distant month is 145 yuan and 60 cents cotton fell 50 to 35 cents, the near month is 74 yuan and 60 cents the month is 76 yuan and 55 cents.

Indian Cotton Inventory Is Abundant

—Exceeding Export Needs—

Although the market atmosphere was weak last week, the fluctuations were not large. Due to the Japanese control of foreign exchange, the inventory in Karachi was abundant, exceeding export needs. However, once normal conditions are restored, inquiries can be improved. Lancashire and the mainland are both interested. Japanese buyers are all offsetting previous amounts, and factory needs are mediocre.

The arrival of Luo Xi goods is gradually increasing. First-class goods are sold mixed with low-grade goods. The following is a statistical appendix for last week (unit: thousand packages).

Attached is the export volume of Rangoon cotton last week

The Standard Gold Market Was Slightly Weak During the Holiday, and Foreign Exchange Was Slightly Tight

During the holiday period, the gold market saw a slight decline due to the fall in pure gold. The foreign exchange market saw a healthier appetite for stomach from banks, but the final trend seemed soft. The following is a brief description of the gold market on the 8th and 9th and the foreign exchange market for three days.

On the 8th (Monday), the gold market fell 70 cents as soon as it opened due to the small drop of one penny in pure gold. The morning opening was 1153.20 yuan. Due to the purchases of Dafeng, Hengyu, and Xinxiang, the noon closing rose to 3.50 yuan. There was not much change in the aftermarket. The opening price was 3.40 yuan, and Yongli sold off, once falling to 3.20 yuan. The closing price was 1153.30 yuan, fluctuating only 30 cents throughout the day. As a result, it fell back 60 cents.

The foreign exchange market opened flat. Although foreign firms sold after the opening, the results were still unchanged due to the healthy appetite for stomach from banks. Midway through, the US dollar was settled by Mobil, and the Chinese merchants replenished the Japanese exchange, which showed a soft trend. However, the closing price was still the recent British exchange rate of one shilling, five pence, 9375, the US exchange rate of 29.75 yuan, the forward shilling of 53125, and the US dollar of 29.625 yuan. On this day, Chinese merchants only replenished more than 200,000 yuan of Japanese gold.

On the 9th (Tuesday), the gold market continued to fall by half a penny due to the continued decline in pure gold. However, since there were not many sellers, the morning opening rose slightly by a few cents to 1153.10 yuan. Dachangxiang, Yuanmao, Yongdacheng sold bars, once seeing 3.20 yuan. Fuxing, Yongqia, Fengyong bought bars. It rose to 4 yuan. Yongfeng Dachangxiang continued to cut more, and fell to 3.50 yuan. Fuxingyong bought again, and the noon closing was 3.80 yuan. The aftermarket opening was 3.60 yuan. Dadecheng closed, and the closing price was 1153.30 yuan, the same as the previous closing. There were eight corners of ups and downs throughout the day, but the boiled red was more expensive. Dadecheng sold to Hankou Bang according to an additional 15 yuan.

The foreign exchange market opened flat again in the morning. Banks made deals with each other. Midway through, it was determined that Chinese merchants were still replenishing East Exchange, so the Japanese gold continued to show a firm trend. Although the result did not change, because there were not many positions, if Chinese merchants had transactions, it would be difficult to settle. Although the closing exchange rate was fair, it belonged to a matching market.

The gold market was closed on the 10th (Wednesday), and the foreign exchange market was lively instead. Chinese merchants sold quite a lot, but because the demand from banks exceeded the supply, and foreign firms also settled shillings, the recent process became tight. At the close, the recent British exchange rate was one shilling, two pence, 5625 US dollars, 29.71875 yuan, and the forward British exchange rate was half a penny, with the US exchange rate at 59375, which was 0.03125 tighter than the previous close. The Japanese exchange rate remained the same. The spot selling price was 104.25 yuan, and the buying price was 104.625 yuan.

During the holiday period for the February public list of the Gold Exchange, only 14 bars were sold by Yongfeng to Qiafengyong.

### Sugar Market

Domestic Sugar Inventory Increases by More Than 30,000 Packages

### Metals

New Lead Wire Prices Drop by 1.5 Yuan

Due to the scarcity of new lead wire arrivals, the market was brisk, with the standard reaching as high as 16.5 yuan. However, with the end of the lunar year approaching, all industries are closing accounts. It has been found that new goods have already been loaded in the last few days of the year, and hoarders are releasing their stockpiles, so sentiment is relatively sluggish, and market prices have also eased. Calculations show that the opening price is 14 yuan per dan (approximately 50 kilograms), a sharp drop of 1.5 yuan compared to before. Only 400 to 500 dan were transacted. However, the markets for coarse and fine grades are still holding, with prices remaining around 14 yuan and 20 yuan respectively. Apart from these, the markets for old lead wire and fire-damaged wire have seen little change due to good sentiments among those seeking to acquire goods.

### Miscellaneous Items

Large Shipment of Japanese Goods Arrives in Shanghai - Regular Schedule Insufficient, Additional Temporary Sailings Added

Japanese goods are arriving continuously. During the period when this newspaper was not published, in addition to irregular Japanese vessels (i.e., those with unscheduled sailings), three regular ships arrived, carrying a total of over 9,350 tons. This includes 7,000 bags of sugar, over 9,700 pieces of iron bars and iron sheets, over 1,330 pieces of copper wire, over 1,430 boxes of salt sulfate, and over 30,000 pieces of various goods such as bleaching powder, salted fish, and sulfur, it is said.

Shen Bao Children's Supplement

### What Attitude Should We Have When Reading?

— Nian Kang

Learning the Spirit of Life from Three Small Animals

Children, what attitude do you usually have when you read? Here are three kinds of spirit that are unique in the lives of three small animals, to give you inspiration and reference for your reading attitude:

(1) Ants Foraging: The spirit of ants foraging for food is simply one of hard work and dedication, reaching everywhere. Although their bodies are small, their strength is great; their belief in survival is very strong, willing to sacrifice the individual for the group, unwilling to give up the original goal. Their lives are about overcoming difficulties through hard work. The attitude to reading should learn from the spirit of ants foraging, to collect materials, to make decisions, to work hard!

(2) Silkworms Spinning Silk: "The spring silkworm spins silk until it dies," which is a spirit of sacrificing oneself for spinning silk. The attitude to reading should be "focused", "thorough", and make in-depth research, burying oneself in hard work; moreover, although silkworms spin a lot of silk, it is very systematic and organized, and finding the silk thread can lead to its unravelling, so the reading attitude should have the ability to organize materials!

(3) Bees Making Honey: Bees making honey is an act of storing food. In the climate and environment of winter, they cannot get food, so they work hard to collect flowers and make honey early. Reading should also start early, seeking more knowledge, preparing for application when needed; and bees collect flowers by taking the essence and removing the dross. Reading must also be based on this attitude, with the ability to judge and distinguish right from wrong!

### Why are Chimneys in Factories and Businesses Built Extraordinarily High?

— Jiang Man

After 4 p.m., Mr. Wang went into the city on business and took us to visit Minsheng Factory along the way.

Before we even reached Minsheng Factory, the factory's tall chimney had already caught our eye. We had visited many factories before, and we remembered that their chimneys were all extraordinarily tall, even the lowest ones were several zhang (approximately 3 meters) high. What is the reason for this? I asked Mr. Wang.

"You ask a good question!" Mr. Wang said, "See if any of you can answer it?"

Yang Baichuan replied: "I think, when the chimney is high, the coal can be burned more easily; when the coal can be burned more easily, it can save coal. I wonder if that's right?"

Mr. Wang immediately smiled and said, "That's right! That's right! Saving coal, that's one point, is there anything else?"

Yang Baichuan continued to think, and we were also thinking silently. But we couldn't figure it out. After a while, Mr. Wang said, "There is another reason, let me tell you: when burning coal, there must be a kind of carbon dust, black smoke, and stinking gas spewing out of the chimney. These things are extremely harmful to our bodies. At this time, if they have very high chimneys, those black smoke, coal dust, and stench will be blown away by the wind at a high place; otherwise, if their chimneys are too low, it's a minor matter that they themselves use coal uneconomically, but the nearby residents will suffer greatly. Isn't this an extremely dangerous thing?"

"Yes! Yes!" We listened attentively, and slowly paced along, unknowingly arriving at the entrance of the factory.

### Crucian Carp

— Zhong Mei

This afternoon, Xiaomin's aunt came from the countryside to visit Xiaomin's mother, and brought several crucian carp as a gift for Xiaomin, so he was very happy, waiting in the kitchen to see how his mother cooked them. When the cooking started, Xiaomin asked his mother: "Mother, what's inside the crucian carp's belly?"

"There are five kinds of structures inside the crucian carp's belly: 1. Circulatory and respiratory systems. The circulatory system is very simple, composed of one auricle and one ventricle. The respiratory system uses gills, and the mouth and gill slits can be opened and closed to each other. 2. Digestive system: Teeth grow in the upper and lower cheeks of the oral cavity, the esophagus is very thin and short, connected to the stomach below, followed by the intestine, where the intestine coils, there are gallbladder, liver, and spleen. There is a swim bladder on the chest, abdomen, and back sides, which is divided into front and back parts because the center is slightly narrow, and connects to the esophagus. 3. Excretory and reproductive systems. The excretory system has two kidneys. Reproductive system: Males have two testicles, females have two ovaries. 4. Nervous system; the sense of smell is very keen, the eyes have no eyelids, the ears have inner ears, the brain is undeveloped, the midbrain is larger than the cerebrum. 5. Skeleton and muscles: The skeleton is all hard bones, the structure of the skull is more complicated. Muscles: Unlike other animals, it is composed of many L-shaped muscle segments, attached to the left and right of the spine, and can be stretched and flexed at will."

"Then what kinds of fins does the crucian carp have? What are their functions?"

"On both sides of the front end of the torso are called pectoral fins; at the rear end are called pelvic fins. Their function is to be able to change direction when swimming, and slowly propel forward. On the back ridge is the dorsal fin, behind the anus is the anal fin. Their function is to be able to maintain the stability and uprightness of the body. At the tail, it's called the caudal fin, and its function is also to change direction."

"Then what other functions does the crucian carp have besides being eaten by us?"

"Their bones and scales can be made into fish fertilizer and fish glue, which are very useful in agriculture and industry."

### Ants and Lions

— Ying

There were many lions living on a very high cliff, and many ants living at the foot of the mountain. One day, the Ant King summoned many ants to a meeting because food was scarce at the foot of the mountain. The Ant King chaired the meeting and explained the reason for the meeting, so many ants discussed it one after another, but there was still no proper solution.

While they were discussing, the Ant King suddenly saw the Lion King walking on the top of the mountain. The Ant King said to the Lion King: "Because food is scarce at the foot of the mountain, we ask you to send a lion down every day. If you don't allow it, then we will kill all the lions on the mountain together." The Lion King listened to its words and sneered, answering: "Do you weaklings also want to eat our powerful lions? It's just a dream." After the Lion King finished speaking, he left without looking back.

The Ant King ordered many ants to bore through the foot of the mountain. The ants worked very hard to bore into the foot of the mountain. Sure enough, in less than a few days, the foot of the mountain was shaking. While many lions were sound asleep, the cliff collapsed with a loud crash, and many lions died an unnatural death. From then on, they no longer lacked food.

Although this is a fairy tale, it shows that unity can overcome all tyranny, and hard work can overcome all difficulties.

### Bees and Butterflies

— Zhu Chengxi

Bees hum and buzz,

Singing happy tunes,

"Work hard in spring and summer,

Making plenty of honey,

No need to worry or fret,

Autumn and winter are still warm and full."

Butterflies fly anxiously,

Worrying about enduring cold and hunger,

"Knowing only how to play in the summer,

Leaves fall and flowers fly in the autumn,

Now with no clothes or food,

It's so miserable to think about?"

### The Child Who Wasn't Afraid of Death

— Lu Zhonghong

This story occupies the most glorious page in the history of the Franco-Prussian War. Apart from a few children who already know it, most children, I'm afraid, even if they've heard it, have already forgotten it. Now, I don't mind repeating it and writing it out again to provide a good reference for our children during this national crisis.

During the Franco-Prussian War, the French army retreated to a small town. This small town needed to be defended, because behind the town lay a lush forest, and the enemy's movements could not be seen from the town. So the French general begged a child who had not run away, pointing to a large tree in the town and saying:

"Can you climb this big tree? See if there are any traces of the enemy in the forest behind?"

"What can't I do? I often climb trees."

After the child finished speaking, he climbed up the tree and sat on a thick branch, looking around. The general said:

"What do you see?"

"What I see is a Prussian flag, waving in the forest."

"What else do you see?"

"Wait a moment, let me climb up a little further - oh, ... there are many Prussian soldiers."

At this moment, suddenly there was a "bang" sound, and a bullet was fired from the forest. The French army was horrified, but the general calmly said to the child:

"Come down! Good boy, they saw you, it's very dangerous."

"It doesn't matter, I'm hiding in the leaves, they can't hit me."

"Then what are they doing now?"

The child did not answer, and tried his best to climb up the tree, swaying and scouting. Although the enemy's bullets continued to shoot at him, the general tried his best to stop him. He was not afraid at all, and after all, he reported the situation he had scouted:

"They are all moving, shouldering their guns - ah, they are divided into two teams again, one team is going east, one team is going west - ah, they are running towards us along both sides of the river."

"Enough, enough, brave child, come down quickly, it's dangerous, we have to move too."

The child still wanted to climb higher, but bullets came in bursts. At first, his calf was hit by a bullet, and later his abdomen was also pierced by a bullet. Only then did he relax his hands, and fell straight down like a wounded bird. His hot blood flowed profusely, and his face changed color, but he still moved his small mouth and muttered:

"It doesn't matter, I'm doing it for our France."

The general was busy deploying troops, and had no time to pay attention to him. He lost too much blood, lay painfully on the ground, his brows furrowed, his eyes weakly open, his small mouth trembling, as if anxiously waiting for something. When the cheers of "Long live France" and the shouts of "Brave child, your spirit will never die" reached his ears when the French army returned in triumph after annihilating the Prussian army, he only saw the general standing solemnly in front of him, telling him, "Respectable child, I wish you ascend to heaven, we have won completely." After saying this, a trace of a satisfied smile appeared on the child's ashen face, and he slept peacefully wrapped in the national flag.

### Convection

— Zhen

On Sunday, Min'er asked his brother to visit the factory, because he had never been to a factory before. His brother, wanting him to gain more knowledge, readily agreed to his request. After they walked for a while, Min'er saw many tall chimneys in the distance. He knew that the chimneys were in the factory, but comparing them to the chimney in his own home, they appeared even taller, which made him wonder.

"Brother, aren't they silly? What's the use of building such tall chimneys? What if they get blown down by a big wind? Look, the chimney in my house is low and short, no matter how strong the wind is, no one can blow it down?"

"You're being silly again. All the equipment in the factory is beneficial to the factory itself, so of course the chimneys built so high are no exception. But what is the benefit of building them so high? It turns out that it makes the air have a kind of convection, which allows the furnace to have a continuous supply of fresh air, so it can burn vigorously. You need to know that combustion needs fresh air the most, because fresh air has more oxygen, and oxygen can help combustion, save fuel, and also make the fire in the furnace very strong.

"What is convection? What's the proof?"

"We've done a convection experiment before, and I can tell you about it: First, we took a glass bottle, filled half of it with water, then put in a few grains of red dye, and then burned it on a lamp. We could see the red color rising from the center of the bottom of the bottle and falling to the sides of the bottle. This happened several times up and down, and the water in the whole bottle turned red. This is because the water at the bottom of the bottle was heated and rose, and the water on the sides of the bottle was not as hot, so it fell, and brought the red water above down. So this went on and on, and finally the water in the whole bottle turned red, and at the same time the water in the whole bottle was also hot. This leads to a conclusion: The phenomenon of heat circulating up and down with the water is called convection, but it is not only limited to water, other things can also do it." Cong'er continued, "I want to ask you: Why does the refrigerator in my house put ice on the top of the box in the summer? This is also a very good example of convection. Putting ice on the top of the refrigerator makes the air around the ice cold, and when the air gets cold, it goes down, but the air at the bottom of the box is very hot, because it's in the hot summer, so it rises. This way, up and down, after a short time, the refrigerator is filled with cold air, and the food can be prevented from getting hot and spoiling."

They stopped discussing when they arrived at the factory gate and went inside to visit.

### Talking about Cows in the Year of the Ox (with illustrations)

— Dong Xun

This year is the Year of the Ox, so let's take it as a title and talk about it! The cow is a very important livestock among domestic animals. The total number of cows produced in the world is about 510 million, which is about one-third of the world's total population (the world's total population is about 1.8 billion). Among so many cows, according to their use, they can be roughly divided into three major categories: dairy breeds, meat breeds, and draft breeds.

Famous dairy cows include: 1. Holstein ㊀ This cow originated in the Netherlands, and was later improved in the United States. In addition to the dairy breed, there is also a dual-purpose dairy and meat breed. Its coat color has black patches on the back, and the abdomen, tail end, and limbs are all white. Its milk yield and weight exceed those of other cows, so it is raised in many parts of the world. 2. Ayrshire ㊂ This cow originated in Ayrshire, England. Its coat color is white with yellowish-brown spots, and its horns are high and upright. Its milk is suitable for making cheese. 3. Jersey This cow originated on Jersey Island in the English Channel, with a coat color of grayish-brown or blackish-brown and a white nose. Its milk is suitable for making butter. 4. Guernsey This cow is produced on Guernsey Island in the English Channel. Its body shape is similar to that of the Jersey, and its coat color is light yellow with brown, ochre, and white spots. Its milk quality is very rich!

The most famous meat cow is the Shorthorn ㊃. This cow originated in England and was originally bred from a dual-purpose dairy and meat breed. Its shape is as stout and fat as a pig, and its horns are very short. Male cows weigh from 1,200 kg to 1,400 kg, and its coat color is gray-white with some reddish-brown bristles. The meat tastes very good. Others such as the Hereford of England, weighing from 800 kg to 1,000 kg, the Aberdeen-Angus, weighing from 600 kg to 900 kg, and the Galloway, weighing around 800 kg, are all world-famous meat cows.

Draft cows include: 1. Yellow Cattle ㊅ This cow originated in China and various parts of Asia, and is generally used for cultivation or pulling carts. 2. Buffalo, Buffaloes are divided into Indian Buffalo ㊇ and American Buffalo ㊆. American buffaloes are mostly wild, with red and black colors; Indian buffaloes also have two types, one is wild, produced in the Malay Peninsula, and the other is domesticated, found in China, India, Taiwan, Malaysia, and various parts of Asia. This buffalo has a grayish-black or black coat color, and has very long horns (about one meter) on its head. The meat quality is very poor, but it is very strong, and is very suitable for plowing fields and carrying goods, because it likes to bathe in the river, so it is named buffalo! 3. The yak is a specialty of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China and is used to carry goods and operate. Its strength is very great! 4. Brown Swiss ㊁ This cow originated in the northeastern part of Switzerland in a cold climate. It is very strong and suitable for breeding in cold mountainous areas. Its coat color is brown-brown, and it is a Swiss mountain draft cattle breed. 5. Devon ㊄ This is the earliest improved breed of cattle in the world, originating in England, with a whole body of reddish-brown color and a smooth and soft coat. It is lively and vigorous, suitable for agricultural operations, its meat quality is also good, and its milk quality is also abundant, and because it is strong, it is used for bullfighting in Spain.

### If Your Clothes Catch Fire

— Qiong Bai

Children, if your clothes catch fire, how will you put it out? Here, I will introduce you to a few very convenient methods:

㊀ Be calm. Since your clothes have already caught fire, panicking will not help. The proper way is to try to put it out. Do not run or jump around, because this will only make the fire more intense.

㊁ Flames always go upwards, so when clothes catch fire, the face and hair are in the most dangerous position. You should immediately lie down on the ground, so that your face and hair will not be injured, and roll on the ground to reduce the flames.

㊂ We know that combustion requires oxygen, so we can also use this principle to put out the fire. Quickly take a quilt, blanket, or something similar, and tightly wrap your body, so that it is isolated from the air. The flame will go out because there is no oxygen supply. When wrapping, start from the head and neck and wrap downwards, otherwise if you wrap from below, the flame will surge upwards, burning your eyebrows, hair, and face.

### Cockfight

— Xie Jiasheng, 5th Grade Student, Zhiben Elementary School

This morning, when I got up, after washing, I was reading at home. Suddenly I heard someone outside shouting: "Look at that fierce one! Look at that fierce one"! I went out to take a look, oh! It turned out to be a rooster from the east neighbor fighting with a rooster from my house. At first, the east neighbor's chicken fought more and more bravely, and the chicken in my house gave way everywhere. Later, the east neighbor's chicken took an inch and wanted a mile, and was not satisfied. The chicken in my house knew that in order to survive, it had to cheer up and make up its mind to "fight to the death" to fight a decisive battle with it. After all, the east neighbor's chicken lost, and the chicken in my house won. I watched for a while, and then went home to write.

Later, the east neighbor's chicken never dared to invade again.

### Righteousness (4)

— Qing

In August of 1826, a small schooner named "Magpie" was sailing in this sea area, commanded by a young first mate, Edward Smith. They were searching for a pirate ship that had been rampant off the west coast of Cuba for a long time. The weather was very hot that day. At dusk, the "Magpie" anchored near the rocks of Colorados. At eight o'clock, a gentle breeze rose from the west, and the sails were unfurled. However, in less than an hour, the wind shifted to the south, and a small plume of greyish-yellow smoke could be seen in the moonlight. This was a sign of impending danger, as all seafarers knew. So, First Mate Smith immediately rushed to the deck and ordered the sails to be furled, preparing to resist the storm with all their might.

The clouds quickly multiplied, and within seconds, all was silent. Then, a charging, roaring sound came, first from afar, but in an instant, it grew closer and louder. The sea, which had been as calm as a lake, was now suddenly pushed by a black wall, which crashed into a large mass of white foam, flying like snowflakes. At that moment, it hit their ship! Amidst the roar of the raging waves, the first mate shouted to cut down the masts quickly, but it was too late. Their ship had already tilted to one side, and in the blink of an eye, it sank completely! A second mate named Melder, in a flash of lightning, saw his companions struggling in the water. He swam towards the rapids above the sunken ship and grabbed a paddle, then a second. The hurricane, having completed its work, blew away. The sea then calmed down again, as if the struggle with the waves had been just a dream.

Melder held his breath and listened for any sound from his companions nearby. After a while, he exhaled, because he heard a voice asking who was there. It was First Mate Smith and six other companions, who had grabbed a floating lifeboat. The other sailors, upon seeing this, were overjoyed and rushed towards it. Soon, twenty-four men were hanging onto the boat, with some lying on the keel. As a result, the lifeboat completely lost its effectiveness and was merely floating on the water.

First Mate Smith ordered them to let go together so that the boat could right itself. They obeyed the order and let go. Then, Smith sent two men into the boat to use their hats to bail out the water. He also told the others to hang onto the edge of the boat to reduce the weight so that everyone could get on board. Unexpectedly, while they were bailing water, a sailor suddenly cried out, saying he saw a shark's fin. Everyone panicked, fearing they would be eaten by the fish, and they all crowded into the boat. But with too much force, they capsized the boat again. The first mate firmly ordered them back into the water and to right the boat again. He also told them to vigorously move their legs in the water to keep the sharks away. Everything was going well, and four people could now fit in the boat. After dawn, hope was especially high, but around ten o'clock, someone shouted again: "Shark! Shark!" They saw not just one, but as many as fourteen or fifteen. Immediately, there was even greater panic, and they capsized the boat again. First Mate Smith quickly used a calm and firm voice to stop the sailors from panicking. He sent two men onto the boat again, and the others hung on outside. The sharks initially seemed to be playing around, swimming close and rubbing against the sailors' bodies, some even swimming over the boat. Finally, one man cried out in pain because a shark had bitten his leg. Once the fish tasted blood, there was no hope for that man. Smith held onto the stern of the boat, trying to calm the sailors and encouraging those in the boat to bail water quickly, while comforting those nearby to wait patiently so that everyone could get on board and escape danger.

### Six Days

— Me

As usual, this publication takes a six-day break for the winter vacation. The six days have passed in the blink of an eye, and today is the seventh day. According to custom, we will meet with readers every day again. This is originally a very interesting thing, but today, in the Lunar New Year, it is still the first time meeting with readers. What should we talk about with you all? National affairs? The matter that the Chinese people pay the most attention to is the Shaanxi Incident. Now, the Xi'an Incident has been completely resolved. This matter can certainly be reported to the Chinese people, but this matter had a trend of being completely resolved six days ago, so the news can be said to be old news and has no value. In addition to the upcoming opening of the Third Plenary Session tomorrow, there are no other new or joyful things that can be told. International affairs? The situation is changing unpredictably, and it is still in the "wait and see what happens next" category. Since there is nothing to say, there is no need to say it. What I am talking about now is the situation during the six days in my hometown. If I want to tell you about my life situation during those six days, I can summarize it in one sentence: I only spent the Lunar New Year busily.

However, the Lunar New Year is also said to be the Yin-Yang New Year. This kind of New Year has already been named as the abolished calendar and has been abolished for a long time. Even if one spends this troublesome New Year, what could be so busy about it, what could there be to do? Little did they know that the facts tell us that it is not so. In fact, the mainland only has the Lunar New Year and does not know the Solar New Year. The first reason for this is the ingrained habits of society, and the second is the stubbornness of the mind. Habits are not easy to eliminate in a short time, and the mind cannot be changed in a short time either. It is very easy to say, but very difficult to do. I will now write about some of the difficult situations in making changes. I cannot say it is based on experience, but it can be said that it happened because of circumstances.

Let me explain these situations one by one. As the abolished calendar's New Year approaches, relatives and friends will send New Year cakes or gifts. After the 20th of the lunar month, the sound of firecrackers offered to the Kitchen God and the Earth God will be endless, like arrows fired in succession. Assuming you have a weak mind, you will definitely not be able to close your eyes all night. Once the New Year arrives, there will be even more colorful displays. Every house will have tall red candles and bright red satin chair covers, which must be stretched taut, creating a magnificent scene. If you walk into someone's house, you will be served exquisite fruit platters with sweets, fruits, cakes, and other delicacies. The servants will also keep shouting "Congratulations" several times. At this time, how can I not stretch out my "waist" and dig out some money from my pocket? Also, when you meet friends on the street or receive relatives at home, they will bow their heads and offer auspicious words of "Congratulations and may you get rich," which are used appropriately. At this time, can you not say a word? If you walk on the street, no matter how big or small the stores are, many will display a 'closed for the New Year' sign and serve you a "closed door soup". You will only hear the sound of New Year gongs and drums, and almost nothing can be bought except in a few tobacco, paper, candy, and fruit shops. If you go to the temples, the people burning incense will be like mountains and seas, crowded and impassable, and the stalls of small businesses will be packed tightly, selling paintings, clay Buddhas, sweets, bowls, firecrackers, and vermicelli soup. Everywhere you look, there's something for sale. In such an environment, how can you jump out of the environment and not celebrate the New Year? Unless you don't live in this society. Assuming you don't live in this society and go to another society, it will be the same. Assuming you are not dominated by the environment, they celebrate their New Year, and you celebrate yours, people will either say you are being pretentious or say you are a monster. I ask you, do you have great ability to break this environment and resist this society? Not to mention the countryside, yesterday I came to Shanghai, the so-called New York of the East, and counted how many shops were open. If you go to the City God Temple, don't even think about having any room to stand.

### Happiness

— Ximei

Everyone wants happiness, but happiness can never come to find people; instead, people must go to find happiness.

The first condition for finding happiness is to have a strong body. People with weak bodies will not be happy even if they have wealth, fame, or status. Therefore, happiness is like a large building, and good health is the cornerstone of building the building. Since the relationship between good health and happiness is so important, people who want to find happiness must first improve their own bodies. If they suffer from anemia, they should take blood-boosting medicines. If they have a tendency to lung disease, they should take cod liver oil. Wuzhou Pharmacy's Zilai Blood and Benpai Cod Liver Oil are the most effective! Taking them regularly will make your body healthier day by day, and your happiness will be boundless!

### Confessions of a Socialite

— Feng

She is a socialite, and most people admire her very much.

Her face is so beautiful, and her skin is very fair. Her hair is very shiny and always emits a fragrant scent. Especially her teeth, which are as white as jade.

Someone asked her about her life, and she said: "Others must think that I am studying makeup, but in fact, my makeup is very simple. After washing my face, I apply 'Yipinxiang'. I only spray '131 Hair Tonic' on my hair, and I brush my teeth with '131 Toothpaste' every morning and evening. That's it."

She also said: "The era of using foreign goods is over. Using domestic goods in social circles is both beautiful and economical. Therefore, the several cosmetics I use are all products of Wu Da Pharmacy."

### Road Hero

— Luo Caiqing

Once the New Year arrives, there is indeed a New Year atmosphere. Even people who are overwhelmed by debts and worldly affairs on New Year's Eve, when they raise their hands and shout "Congratulations and may you get rich," seem to be reborn.

Celebrating the New Year is naturally joyful. It not only shows that everyone has aged by one year, but also that the future in the new year is unlimited. The owners in the shops want to welcome the God of Wealth, while the shop assistants take out gongs and drums and play them from the first day of the New Year until the Lantern Festival. It is possible that they will suddenly get excited and take a stroll on the road, which is quite lively, because the road during the New Year seems to be their territory. Playing New Year gongs and drums is still being responsible. Another type is to throw money crackers at women, "With a loud bang, clapping and laughing." It is a wonderful contrast to the ancient heroes "drawing their swords to help when they see injustice on the road." They are called: "Road Heroes," that's what it means. There is no intention to be deliberately mean to them.

I used to read many articles about "pushing," "kicking," and "trampling" in the newspaper. Now "throwing" may be a new kind of "art," because being thrown at, pushed, kicked, or trampled on can cause serious injury or make one blush. However, "throwing" only targets women.

I rarely spend the New Year in Shanghai. Even if I spend the New Year in Shanghai, I rarely go to the road to "join the fun." So, seeing "a loud bang" I thought it was a strange thing. Later I learned that "throwing money crackers" has been around for a long time. It is said that the road regulations in the concessions are quite thoughtful regarding rickshaw drivers' permits, such as walking on the left, traffic lights, and so on, because there is a risk of hitting pedestrians, but there is no prohibition on throwing money crackers, especially during the New Year, which is already a common "embellishment." This grace seems to be more closely linked to the name "Road Heroes."

But after seeing this situation, I began to think wildly. Playing New Year gongs and drums is a "fun for all," and people lean out of the windows when they hear you playing "clang clang," and those walking on the road suddenly stop to watch you dance, isn't that already "heroic" enough? But some people still want to throw money crackers. Being scolded as "a thousand cuts" may be regarded as "flirting," which is quite to the heroes' liking. If one day it "seriously injures the body," then instead of becoming a "hero," they become a prisoner, which seems too discouraging. In the end

I blamed those who made the money crackers. And I did read a piece of "heartwarming" news: a local man, Xu BaoBao, 26 years old, and his younger brother, BaoXing, 23 years old, who both lived at No. 146, Lane 14, Qiujiang Road, Hongkou, recently bought a large amount of raw materials for making firecrackers as partners, and worked day and night at home to make them, preparing to sell them during the abolished Lunar New Year in order to make a profit. Yesterday at 1:30 pm, when the two were making the firecrackers, the raw materials suddenly exploded. The two failed to escape, and both suffered severe burns on their faces and hands. Later, their family members took them to the hospital for treatment. It is said that Xu BaoBao was seriously injured and his life may be in danger.

This statement defends the road heroes a bit. However, when people buy scrap copper and iron to make bombs and buy silk cocoons to make airplane parachutes, I can't help but think of the artillery fire of the January 28th Incident, which is similar to "a loud bang." The Xu brothers did not die from the artillery fire of the January 28th Incident, but died from "the sudden explosion of firecracker raw materials," while those road heroes still aimed at the chests of women and threw money crackers, "With a loud bang, clapping and laughing." It feels like five years have passed too quickly!

### Hall

— Zhongbing

All there is is empty silence. Like a devout cultivator, the hall stands solemn and speechless all day.

On the fifty-two difficult stone steps, the hall is built in the distant void. Straight and slanted lines, even and clean arcs; the tile ridges as neat as fish scales, the orderly columned corridors, and the ancient, decaying wind chimes at the corners of the eaves, create a classic harmony.

Two stone lions with dancing claws and bared teeth guard the entrance of the hall, but all there is is empty silence. Inside the hall doors, the misty clouds of smoke, the fragrant clouds of smoke, and the clouds of light poured out by the ever-burning lamps diffuse. The dim light of the ever-burning lamps reflected on the hemp-yellow curtain is like the desolate light of the lamps in front of the feet of the dead before entering the coffin, reflected on the plain curtain of mourning, quietly and coldly congealing into a single piece.

Through the tassel-like embroidered edges of the curtain, the wooden idols stand humbly in the square inch of the Buddhist niche, and the clay idols sit on the pure and transcendent lotus petals. And the eyes of all the idols contain the classical ingenuity of the sculptor, releasing merciful gazes and caressing the devout disciples to transcend them.

The misty clouds of smoke, the fragrant clouds of smoke, and the clouds of light poured out by the ever-burning lamps, the hall is being smoked, infected, and enduring the cold loneliness and dead silence. In the air of the Buddhist hall, silence is like a delicate amplifier, amplifying the subtle sounds of the night lessons into loud and distant sounds. Thus, in the strict silence, the clear wooden fish sounds and the sonorous cymbal sounds continue, along with the harmony of praise.

The hall always stands solemn and speechless. All there is is empty silence.

Opening "Scenery of the Four Seasons"

A branch of "Jade Plum" heralds the return of spring, and the scenery of "Xin Garden" is reopened. The "tender green" color of the "Yangliu Green" shines, and the "bright" peach blossoms are like colorful clouds piled up. "Swallows" follow the wind and chase each other, and "butterflies" wear flowers and are not tired. In an instant, the whole garden is "competing for fragrance", and a "cuckoo" urges the spring to end. "Li Lian" blooms, "Qian Ping" flourishes, the moon is "juan juan," the wind is "xu lai," listening to thunder at the "Saizhen Tower," enjoying the cool at the "Ji Pavilion." Remember the "Lanjun Orchid" outside the window, "Ruxiang" fills the room and enters my heart. And again, the moon raises the "Minghui" and the Milky Way is clean, and the painted screen initially displays "Zhiyun" flying. A piece of "light illuminates" thousands of miles of white, how much "autumn heart" should be seen in this. Yellow flowers are thin, "enduring frost" and cold, the "lone goose" sings high into the clouds. Who knows, one night of "autumn wind" and autumn rain, adds several layers of "autumn marks" wet moss. "Hujia" plays, "Yiwei" turns, and the "ancient pine" stands towering in front of the wind. It is difficult to sleep alone on the quilt, and "Mengshi" is frozen and composes "Xuehuai" by the window. I only say that "Xianzhai" is cold and difficult to spend in loneliness, fortunately, the "Naifang" in the pot accompanies the cold years, and the meaning of "Drunkard" is enough to comfort.

Opening "New Year"

The wax goes and spring returns, and all things are new. The sound of firecrackers expresses joy. Every household changes peach charms, and in the sound of gongs and drums, they wish for peace. Everyone, big and small, is happy, and every congratulation brings a smile. Some have a glass of warm wine and family fun, and students and old friends talk together. Some have a Sheng and Xiao string ensemble, and Qing plays the flute and Sheng. Some write red with a pen in the New Year to take auspicious words, and may all things be as you wish. Some play eight rounds of clearing games, and it doesn't matter to relax and talk about winning or losing. Some go on a spring outing in pairs, and are more affectionate. Some have naughty children throwing small firecrackers, and every sound is a surprise. There are more tourists on the road than crickets, and every piece of clothing is dazzling. In fact, the New Year is the same old person, why must every piece of clothing be new. Although it is a custom passed down, it is considered a happy event once a year. If there is no New Year to decorate, on New Year's Eve, the total accountant will not be able to settle the accounts clearly. I wish everyone to start from scratch, and work hard to use the opportunity. The plan of the year lies in spring.

### The Clarion Call of Chinese Children's Drama

News of the Upcoming Establishment of "Our Children's Drama Society"

The Chinese theater world has always paid little attention to children's drama, but children's drama is indeed an important task in children's education. Therefore, the younger members of various theater troupes in this city feel that general theater troupes cannot provide them with opportunities for research or talent, and they deeply know that children's drama urgently needs to be promoted by children themselves. Therefore, they initiated the organization of "Our Children's Drama Society" in September last year. Preparing until now, they have been working hard with their own finances and strength. They rehearsed plays such as "In the Crossfire" and "Wild Children" in November last year, intending to participate in the founding meeting of the "Children's Friends Association" of the Shanghai Evening News. However, the script was banned by the concession authorities, and the "Bell Sounds of the Ancient Temple" of the "Children's Friends Association" was also banned. Therefore, most of the actors of "Bell Sounds of the Ancient Temple" participated, which greatly increased the strength of the society. And in December, during the Christmas holiday, they were invited by St. Duerte School to perform the play "Wild Children," which was well received. In December, they also initiated the "Shanghai Theater World Aid Sui Joint Performance," which was attended by more than 30 theater troupes in this city. However, due to the situation and the procedures for reviewing the scripts, the Social Affairs Bureau did not approve 26 scripts and ban 10 scripts until the end of January this year. At that time, the society was actively preparing for the founding meeting and the public performance of the three-act children's play "Love's Education." It was not possible to reconvene the theater troupes, so the "Aid Sui Joint Performance" was implemented. Later, due to the problem of the theater, the society decided at its ninth preparatory meeting: to postpone the public performance and convene the founding meeting in advance. The "Aid Sui Joint Performance" was also suspended because most of the scripts approved by the Social Affairs Bureau had been banned by the concessions before, and theaters in Nanshi, Zhabei, and other districts did not approve of theatrical performances. Therefore, the society also decided to suspend the process at the preparatory meeting. It is now heard that the society has more than 30 members and is about to hold a founding meeting, and has issued letters of origin and soliciting sponsors and supporting organizations.

### Recent News of the Forties Drama Society Rehearsing "Sai Jinhua" and "Qiu Jin"

"Sai Jinhua" and "Qiu Jin" are scheduled to meet with people in the capital at the Capital National Grand Theater on February 17, so all departments have been working extremely hard in recent days.

In the prologue of "Qiu Jin," the Qiu Jin couple had already clashed. The conflict intensified in the first and second acts. Due to the approaching date of the trip to Beijing, rehearsals were added, so Wang Xianzai, who plays Wang Tingjun, and Li Lilian, who plays Qiu Jin, argued several times a day.

### "Paradise Yearning for Earth" at the Great Shanghai Cinema

### Hua'an Broadcasting

The film "A Match Made in Heaven," directed by Shen Fu, has now been completely edited and submitted to Beijing for review. It will be released soon. The film was shot at 100,000 feet, with 9,000 feet of highlights selected. There are 85,000 humorous scenes that will make you laugh 300 times during the screening.

In "A Match Made in Heaven," the comedic superstar Han Langen plays a lonely worker, Bai Lu plays a street girl, Liu Jiqun plays a factory owner, and Yin Xiucen plays a worker, all with extremely moving performances.

The song "Carefree Ramblings" in "A Match Made in Heaven" was deemed too frivolous by the Film Review Board, so it was not included, a painful sacrifice and a great pity.

In "A Daughter Among Generals," Li Zhuozhuo is consistently portrayed as a beautiful, charming, patriotic woman who loves the party, while Li Qing plays a steadfast, courageous, and forward-thinking model party member.

The cast of "Daughter of a General" is as follows: Li Zhuozhuo as the general's daughter, Li Qing as a party member, Heng Li as a general, Han Langen as a soldier, Mei Lin as the old servant's daughter, Hong Jingling as the general's henchman, and Liu Jiqun as an old servant, a very appropriate combination.

"Daughter of a General" is a shocking and significant film directed by He Mengfu, and it is also the first collaboration between Li Zhuozhuo and Li Qing.

"A Pearl Lost in the Sea" is Zhu Shilin's new work, with a very compact and tortuous plot, full of dramatic value. What's especially wonderful is that it captivates the audience step by step.

In "A Pearl Lost in the Sea," Li Zhuozhuo transitions from youth to old age, from a progressive new woman to a kind and amiable mother. Throughout this transformation, she always fights against the harsh environment to the end. Zhuozhuo's performance is able to move people with emotion.
