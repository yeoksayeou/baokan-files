### The Hopes for a Peaceful Resolution in Shaanxi and Gansu Are Very Slim

Yang Hucheng's Letter is Vague; Li Zhigang Departs from Nanjing After Visiting He Yingqin; The Situation in Lanzhou is Not as Stable as Before

[Nanjing] The prospects for a peaceful resolution in Shaanxi and Gansu are dwindling. Yang Hucheng is stubbornly acting on his own, having ordered his troops to actively prepare. Military forces are deployed along all lines, indicating defiance to the end. The puppet political departments under the control of the Red bandit Zhou Enlai have moved to Lintong along with Yang's military headquarters. Several propaganda teams have been dispatched to various locations to spread propaganda to the soldiers. Military conferences are held daily in Xi'an, with senior Red bandit military officers and political personnel participating. When Mi Chunlin, Bao Wenyou, and Li Zhigang met with Yang Hucheng in Xi'an, Yang did not accept the central government's offer of leniency. Li Zhigang met with Minister He Yingqin and central authorities on the evening of the 21st to report on his meeting with Yang Hucheng, and presented a letter from Yang. The contents of both were extremely vague and impractical. Furthermore, the situation in Lanzhou is not as stable as before. The Red bandits in Hexi have largely retreated, but are blocked by the central army, preventing them from linking up with Lanzhou. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)

[Nanjing] Li Zhigang, representing Yang Hucheng, arrived in Nanjing on the afternoon of the 21st. After reporting to Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, he continued to consult with Minister He at 9:00 AM on the 22nd. He departed from Nanjing for Zhejiang at 10:00 AM to make a report, expected to arrive that afternoon. He will stay for a day or two before returning to Nanjing. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)

[Nanjing] Lei Baohua, the Director of the Construction Department of Shaanxi Province, and his wife, arrived in Nanjing a few days ago.

[Luoyang] There have been minor skirmishes along the defense lines for several consecutive days. (Special dispatch from the 21st)

There are also reports that the Red bandits in northern Shaanxi are attempting to cross the river and flee eastward. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)

[Xuzhou] According to railway news, there is little hope for peace in Shaanxi. The central army is adopting a defensive posture.

It is said that Peng plans to travel to Shaanxi soon. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)

[Nanjing] A telegram from Tongguan reports that the troops of Zhang and Yang on the front lines have repeatedly provoked the central army's defense lines in recent days. The central army is maintaining a strict defense, but no major battles have occurred. The Red bandits who entered Xi'an have suddenly withdrawn from the city and are densely distributed in the villages. Their pseudo-political workers are intensifying propaganda among the troops and work among the civilians. Yang Hucheng's troops stationed in Sanyuan have begun to move towards Xi'an, and the defense duties they leave behind are being taken over by the Red bandits. It is also reported that the Red bandit Xu Donghai's faction is now following pseudo-orders, taking the route through Shangxian County, and plotting to disrupt western Henan in order to divert troops. Their vanguard has reached Ziziguan. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)

[Beiping] Foreign sources say that due to Yang's deteriorating attitude, there is no hope for a peaceful resolution to the Shaanxi-Gansu problem.

### Wang Jingwei Broadcasts a Speech on How to Save the Nation from Destruction

Eliminating Internal Troubles and Defending Against Foreign Aggression - Proceed According to the Original Plan and Steps

[Nanjing] The Central Broadcasting Station invited Chairman Wang Jingwei to give a broadcast speech at 8:35 PM on the 22nd, entitled "How to Save the Nation from Destruction." The original words are recorded as follows:

Ladies and gentlemen, what I want to talk about tonight is how to save the nation from destruction. The so-called saving the nation from destruction is because the disaster of national subjugation is right before our eyes, and we must think of ways to save it. The disaster of national subjugation is so imminent because internal and external troubles are pressing in from all sides. First, let's talk about foreign aggression. After the September 18th Incident, we first lost the three northeastern provinces, and then Rehe. In between, there was also the Battle of Shanghai, the Battle of the Great Wall Passes, and northern Chahar, eastern Hebei, and Hebei are all in extremely difficult circumstances. Such gradual encroachment can lead to China's destruction. Then, let's talk about internal troubles. Wherever the communist bandits go, the people suffer. From Jiangxi, to Hunan, to Guizhou, to Yunnan, to Sichuan, and even to Shaanxi and Gansu, such devastation can also lead to China's destruction. If either of the above two occurs, it is already a disaster for the country, let alone that the two seem to have a secret agreement, using two knives to kill people from two different paths, and now they are gradually merging together? Some people say that it is better to be destroyed by the communist bandits than by foreigners. It should be known that destruction is the same, no matter who causes it. We should not sit idly by and watch it happen, but must save the nation. Some people say that Soviet Russia practiced communism and did not perish. It should be known that Russia's national environment is completely different from ours, and the revolution was also completely different from ours. Moreover, besides Soviet Russia, some countries in Europe that wanted to practice communism have all fallen into danger and destruction. Hungary after the Great War, because it wanted to practice communism, was invaded by Romania and occupied its capital. You must all remember that. Therefore, victorious Italy after the Great War, after a period of communist disturbance, quickly had fascism to counter it. Defeated Germany after the Great War, after a period of communist disturbance, quickly had the National Socialist Party to counter it. Spain has not even fully implemented communism, but is only close to communism, and has already suffered great chaos. The outcome of the chaos is still unknown, but Spain has already been divided into two, and the capital, Madrid, has been shattered. From all this, we can see that not only would China's current practice of communism lead to national destruction, but even being close to communist bandits and being manipulated by them would be enough to cause great chaos and lead to destruction. For several years, China has been struggling in the midst of these internal and external troubles, and when it could take care of eliminating internal troubles, it could not take care of defending against foreign aggression, and when it could take care of defending against foreign aggression, it could not take care of eliminating internal troubles. For several years, the government and the people have been trapped in this double attack, exhausted and overwhelmed, truly indescribable suffering. In such a double attack, it is very difficult to find a way to open up a path to survival. For several years, after accumulating countless painful experiences, we have finally formulated an overall plan and specific steps for saving the nation from destruction. Especially in the past year, this plan and these steps have been steadily moving forward and have been unanimously recognized by the whole country. If this plan and these steps are not unexpectedly hindered, we believe that internal troubles can come to an end in the shortest possible time, because it is well known that the communist bandits have gradually become impoverished after fleeing to Shaanxi and Gansu. If they repent and reform, it will not be difficult for them to comply. Otherwise, they can only be eliminated, and China can focus all its efforts on foreign affairs without worrying about internal affairs. Unexpectedly, there was the Xi'an Incident of December 12th last year, and even more unexpectedly, after Chairman Chiang Kai-shek returned to the capital safely, there was still a part of the army resisting orders and even taking actions towards redification. In this way, internal troubles become more complicated and foreign aggression becomes more rampant. Today, when we talk about saving the nation from destruction, I have no profound theories, but only a sincere appeal for the people of the whole country to recognize the environment, stand firm, and continue to follow the overall plan and specific steps for saving the nation from destruction. You must not be swayed by the communist bandits and fall for their divisive tricks, because although the plan and steps for saving the nation from destruction are multi-faceted, they can be summarized as nothing more than two slogans: "Defend the territory against foreign aggression" and "Unite the people internally." These two slogans have now been detected by the communist bandits and are being used to carry out their divisive tricks. First, let's talk about "defending the territory." We only need to look at the recent defense of Suiyuan against foreign aggression to see that considerable progress has already been made. This progress has not been easy to achieve. Since the two battles of Shanghai and the Great Wall, the government and the people have deeply felt various shortcomings and have been constantly working hard to remedy them, enduring and intensifying their efforts, only then to achieve this progress. The leadership of the central authorities, the concerted efforts of the local authorities, and the unanimous support of the people of the whole country have all been demonstrated in this instance. And at this critical moment, the Supreme Commander was suddenly almost met with misfortune, and the local separatism was about to be re-enacted. With such shaking in the rear and on the flanks, the front lines are also at a loss. What a painful thing this is. This kind of action is clearly dividing the territory, but the communist bandits insist on using the name of resisting Japan, using the name of defending the territory to carry out the reality of dividing the territory. Then, let's talk about "uniting the people." Since the outbreak of national crisis, from the National Crisis Conference to the upcoming National Assembly, all are manifestations of uniting the people. We must know that only the Kuomintang can unite the people, and the Communist Party can never do it. Why is that? The Kuomintang aims at national revolution. The so-called national revolution is to seek the survival and development of the entire country and the entire nation. Therefore, it is based on the common interests of the entire country and the entire nation, and seeks its unity. This is inevitable in reason and in situation. The Communist Party takes class struggle as its aim, advocating using one class to overthrow other classes. Therefore, dismantling the united front of the people is also inevitable in reason and in situation. Just look at the time when the whole country was united in defending the territory against foreign aggression, and suddenly they manipulated from the middle, causing rifts in the troops under the banner of the National Revolutionary Army, and causing rifts in the territory under the flag of the Republic of China. This is a very great evidence of dismantling the united front of the people, but the communist bandits insist on using the name of the "People's Front," using the name of uniting the people to carry out the reality of dismantling the people. What I just said about the divisive tricks is evident here. I believe that if we want to save the nation from destruction today, we can only work hard according to the original plan and steps in order to realize it. And to realize it, the people of the whole country must give the government their full support, without second thoughts, without detours, calmly, bravely, and vigorously moving forward, so that the divisive tricks have no place to be implemented, and the attempts of those who harbor ambitions to seize the opportunity to separate and govern will not occur. Only in this way can we eliminate internal troubles, and only in this way can we defend against foreign aggression. The most important thing for saving the nation from destruction at present is no greater than this. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)

### The Convention on the Use of White Lead in Painting is Approved Later

It should be implemented after the domestic production of substitutes becomes abundant. The Ministry submitted its findings to the Executive Yuan for referral to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. The Ministry has now received a reply from the Legislative Yuan, stating that it has been decided to approve the draft convention later. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)

### Economic Experts Discuss Inheritance Tax

[Nanjing] An economic expert stated that inheritance tax has been implemented for a long time in various countries around the world. It has a sound tax system and is extremely fair. Our country is still in its early stages of implementation, and the tax rate should be kept low to avoid the occurrence of evasion. However, the income tax has not been implemented for long, and the inheritance tax should only be levied after it has been effectively implemented. This will ensure that preparations are sufficient and investigations are accurate, and then proceed gradually. He added that current bank interest rates should be reduced to encourage those with surplus funds to invest in industrial construction. (22nd Special Dispatch)

### Record of a Trip on the Tongguan-Luoyang Train

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Mingxin

On my trip to Luoyang, I stayed for a morning and evening, briefly collecting local customs and writing them down. I gradually learned that there is a train westward from Luoyang to Tongguan every day, so I decided to take it. Since the train departs late, I had some free time, so I visited the Longmen Grottoes and the White Horse Temple, each located more than twenty miles from Luoyang, one to the south and the other to the east. Going south out of the west gate, I first passed the West Palace, which is the location of an important central plains town, with large-scale construction and abundant weapons. As it concerns military secrets, I did not observe further. Then I crossed the Luoyang River, passing Tianjin Bridge (Shao Yong's poem "The cuckoo cries on Tianjin Bridge" refers to this bridge). The bridge is an old structure, unable to bear heavy loads, and a new bridge is currently being built to its left, with the foundations already laid. It is expected to be completed soon. The bridge is located at Shao Yong's old residence, Anle Nest, where his descendants still live, and their virtuous reputation continues to this day. Further on is Guanlin, the tomb of Guan Yu after his head was returned after his death. Ancient cypress trees and red walls surround the palace halls. It was recently renovated by Liu Zhi. I briefly visited it before reaching Longmen. Longmen is building a new bridge, which is not yet completed, but it is magnificent in scale and can meet military needs. The Longmen Mountains stretch continuously, and were cut through by Da Yu to allow the Yi River to flow through, forming cliffs on both sides of the river, known as Yique. The Longmen stone carvings are only a few decades later than Yungang, but they are more damaged. There are small caves on every mountain, and almost every cave is empty. Broken heads and severed feet are everywhere. The cultural relics of more than a thousand years ago have been reduced to firewood by merchants, which is regrettable. Recently, there has been much talk about preserving the ancients, but even the remnants have been stolen recently. Officials have a duty to protect them, so how can they do their job well? I believe that in a few years, there will only be stone caves without Buddha statues. The most magnificent and largest is the Jiujian Palace on the mountainside, where Empress Wu once built a separate palace to escape the summer heat. The Great Buddha is more than fifty feet tall and is still intact. On the opposite bank is Xiangshan Temple, the former residence and burial place of Bai Juyi. He donated his house to become a temple after his death, but it is now in disrepair. Gradually following the road north, I turned out of the east gate to the White Horse Temple. Passing through the east gate, I saw the stele of Confucius entering Zhou to inquire about rites and music. The cultural relics of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty evoke deep thoughts of the past. Ahead is Jiama Camp, the birthplace of Zhu Yuanzhang. Zhu Yuanzhang founded the country with benevolence and righteousness, and his release of military power with wine is a beautiful tale for later generations. Thinking of it, thinking of it, it is far beyond my reach. Further on is the White Horse Temple, which has been destroyed for a long time. Recently, many benefactors have begun to renovate it, but the scale is still not open. The stone carvings are certainly not older than the Jin Tianxi period. This is the initial foundation of the great dharma that came east from ancient Yanhan, but it has fallen into disrepair. Those who promote the dharma should do more to make it clear. In front of the temple is the stupa, which is ancient in construction and square in shape. It has been repaired many times since the Han Dynasty, but it still stands tall in the clouds. The two holy monks, Kasyapa Matanga and Dharmaratna, who carried the sutras from afar, are also buried in the temple. I stayed for a year, but did not see any steles.

From Luoyang to Tongguan is 225 kilometers, and the train takes eight hours. The following are some things that can be recorded along the way: Jingu Garden Station is the old site of Shi Chong. The ruins of the fallen building cannot be found in the desolate smoke and grass. Mianchi is where the King of Qin struck the urn, which shows the way of befriending neighbors, which is very much in line with the spirit of today's equal standing. Arriving at Tongguan, the left is a majestic town, and the right is the Yellow River, with a myriad of scenes. The gate is towering, but it is severely dilapidated. There are many armored vehicles parked at the station, all waiting for orders in the rear. The main roads in the city are divided into four streets: east, south, west, and north. East Main Street has many shops, South Main Street has many grain shops and flower shops, and the walls are covered with red and green paper slogans. Some say Yang Hucheng is a public enemy of Shaanxi, some say Zhang Xueliang is a good man who is brave in correcting his mistakes, some say be careful not to be deceived by approaching bandits, and some say only by concentrating China's strength can we deal with foreign countries. These four items are the movements in politics and military affairs.

There are not many troops stationed in the city, because most of the troops have been ordered to go to the front line for deployment. However, many units on the front line have liaison offices in the city, plus those responsible for guarding and maintaining security. In this small place, there seem to be more soldiers in uniform than civilians. However, the military's training has been improving recently, so the citizens are not alarmed at all, and the market has been revitalized, and trade has become more frequent. There are many soldiers in the restaurants, either sitting alone or eating in groups of three or five, paying the price without demanding anything. Observing this coldly, I know that the progress of the country can be seen here. The soldiers also understand the great righteousness and know the truth. When talking to those sitting next to them, they say that the soldiers are serving their country and have nothing else to say. Every movement and gesture is a resource and vitality of the country. If we can turn perversity into peace, eliminate the communists, and get the other side to repent, then we can restore our strength and move north with even greater courage. The officers and soldiers come from all over the country, and they especially like to talk about the great victory in the Battle of Baiduishan, saying that although they did not participate in the battle themselves, they learned from the telegrams that our army was strong. They believe that it is not difficult to consolidate our country, but it is a pity that there are obstacles.

As for the military deployment here, due to the sensitive nature of the matter, I cannot say everything. Huaxian is in front of Chishui, and across the river is Weinan, which is the territory of Liu Duoquan's 105th Division of the Northeast Army. Liu's troops were originally in Huaxian. After the incident, the front line here immediately went to attack Huaxian, but it was difficult to defend with a small earthen city, so Liu's troops retreated. Fortunately, the area has not been greatly damaged. Now the arrow is on the string, and it is not impossible to rein in the horse before reaching the cliff, so we must wait and see the political operation and whether the other party repents. The phone and telegram lines to Shanxi'an are connected and then cut off. Recently, people have not been allowed to pass through, but there are still a few who can return home. According to them, the communist army did participate, but in small numbers. Currently, they have not carried out large-scale looting of the people. As for Yang's troops, during the incident, the order was chaotic. Two newly arrived blue steel trains of the Longhai Railway were not only completely destroyed, but also the velvet chairs and bedding inside were looted. Soldiers hung velvet blankets on the tips of their spears and sold them along the street for only a few cents each. Even the velvet cushions of the seats were cut off with bayonets, which can be said to be the ultimate in destruction.

In Tongguan City, the people are bustling as usual. Vendors sell food and cloth along the streets endlessly. The North China Hotel is the best in the area, and it is always full of customers. The ancient sites in the city, such as the tree that Ma Chao stabbed Cao Cao in the east street when he escaped. The stab wound is still in the tree, which has not withered to this day. In the Fuxing Medicine Store, soldiers go to see it, jostling and crowding. The Great Temple of Guan Yu, where the characters sometimes appear in intaglio and sometimes in relief. (This must be due to the reflection of sunlight. The locals say it is a sacred object.) Many people also go to see it. As for the Guanxi Academy, where Yang Zhen refused the legacy of gold in the Han Dynasty, thinking that heaven knew, earth knew, I knew, and you knew. There are fewer people who know it, and only those with a scholarly air go to seek the legacy of prudent solitude. There is a theater in the city, a thatched cottage with earthen steps, performing Shaanxi opera. The entrance is deserted, while the post office and telegraph office across the street are not very spacious, but people come to remit money and send letters. They are all soldiers in uniform with swords, and they are extremely crowded. Those who disassemble characters and write letters sell books in the open courtyard in front of the house, and their livelihoods are also thriving. People have the same heart, and the willow color on the street has been the same since ancient times. (Sent from Tongguan on the 18th)

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Meaning of Unity and National Salvation

— Gao

"Unity and National Salvation" is a newly emerging call. The cultural circles of this city once issued a joint declaration published in the newspapers. Expanding greatly on the meaning of national salvation, the many past movements of national salvation are not consistently aligned, but now the meaning of this slogan is clear and simple, the guiding principle is strict, and the appeal is swift. The borders are surrounded by enemies and the house is empty. Saving the country and surviving is on everyone's mind. Speaking of the steps to save the country, we must first seek unity. Speaking of the goal of unity, we must focus on saving the country. Unity is the prelude to saving the country, and saving the country is the conclusion of unity. The two are inevitably linked and cannot be easily separated. This is why the slogan of "Unity and National Salvation" has received unanimous support from all parties.

To say that a country with such a huge population cannot exert its full strength is unbelievable. To say that people with heads and feet would willingly sink into decline and not think of rising up is also difficult to believe. However, as a result of years of turmoil, the failure to concentrate strength is due to differences of opinion and insufficient understanding. A wrong thought can lead to endless sorrow, and a millimeter's mistake can lead to a thousand-mile deviation. There is nothing more regrettable than this. We must know that whatever benefits us, the enemy harms. Whatever harms us, the enemy benefits. We take saving the country as an important strategy for survival, and others try every means to sabotage our efforts to save the country. We take unity as the precursor to saving the country, and others try to undermine the formation of our unity. They exploit the weaknesses of the Chinese people and use their tricks of separate destruction. They threaten the willing, bait the greedy, intimidate the timid, and provoke the suspicious. Those who harbor suspicion are incited with false accusations. Until the snipe and clam fight, they reap the benefits. Past facts are too numerous to list. With a little reflection, it is not difficult to understand. From now on, everyone should be determined to unite and save the country, and everything should be based on unity and national salvation as a prerequisite. Sacrifice the interests of the individual to maintain the overall interests of the country. Abandon personal grievances and respect the authority of government decrees. Under the concentration of national will, jointly seek the realization of national salvation actions.

The ancients said that there is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart, and death of the body is second. Has the heart of our people died completely? Then the call for unity and national salvation will be in vain. If not, we dare to say that under the unified situation, there is nothing insufficient to save the country. At the same time, we also dare to say that under the call to save the country, there is nothing insufficient to consolidate unity. What have the sacrifices and struggles of some Chinese people been for in recent years? For saving the country. What have the forbearance and compromise of some Chinese people been for in recent years? For unity. Fortunately, the unified situation is beginning to take shape, and actions to save the country are advancing. There must be no more excuses to obstruct unity, undermine the country's lifeline, and increase the enemy's arrogance. The people of the whole country should take note of this.

### Rebel Aircraft Bomb Capital City

President Broadcasts Speech Urging People to Resist

Madrid Yesterday late at night and this morning, rebel aircraft bombed four times, dropping more than seventy bombs. The entire city was shaken. It is reported that there were many casualties. Rebel aircraft also dropped bombs in Malaga yesterday, killing fifty people. (22nd National Telegram)

At the same time, the Defense Committee ordered non-combatants to move out of Madrid within seventy-two hours, otherwise they will be forced to leave the city. Azaña said in his speech that the rebels have used Moors and foreign aid from certain countries, which has made the civil war a serious international problem, or may even escalate into a European war. The invasion of Spanish territory by foreigners is no different from attacking the Spanish Republic government. From 5:40 PM this afternoon, the rebels resumed shelling the capital with artillery.

### Bombs Explode in Various Parts of the Portuguese Capital

Ministry of Education Destroyed, Ministry of War Damaged, Twelve Bombs in Total, Fourteen People Detained

Lisbon Today, several bomb attacks suddenly occurred in the city and its suburbs. The first was in the center of the city, destroying a house that was formerly the Spanish consulate. A bomb also exploded at the Portuguese Radio Club, about ten miles from the city. A tower of the National Broadcasting Station in the suburbs was also damaged by a bomb. The greatest loss was at the Ministry of Education, a two-story building that was completely destroyed. When the ceiling collapsed, the minister and a secretary narrowly escaped. Only Captain Dulis was injured. When the bomb exploded, the Portuguese anti-communist army was holding a meeting inside the ministry, and several of its leaders were spared. The fourth bomb exploded in the Ministry of War, resulting in five injuries. The fifth bomb exploded near the oil depot of the Mobil Oil Company, but only destroyed a truck and slightly injured a passerby sleeping next to the house. Another bomb shattered the glass windows of the arsenal. So far, there have been no reports of deaths anywhere. It is reported that the authorities have now arrested fourteen suspects, including one Englishman and one woman. According to the Minister of Interior, these acts of violence are a reflection of international unrest, especially the Spanish incident. This must have been done by the communists, who must have been incited by foreigners and assisted by unscrupulous Portuguese elements. Until midnight, a total of twelve bombs exploded. (21st Reuters Dispatch)

Lisbon After the bombing in this city the day before yesterday, the House of Representatives immediately convened a meeting to discuss it.

The situation was serious, which was self-evident. Subsequently, the proposal by Speaker Dous Reis was passed, requesting the government to take various measures to maintain security, and declaring to the government that the House of Representatives was closely related to the government.

### Japan-US Cotton Industry Establishes Temporary Agreement

Restrictions on Japanese Goods in the US

Osaka The Japan-US cotton industry has recently reached the following temporary agreement: In addition to the agreement, the total amount of cotton cloth shipped to the United States by the Japanese side in the next two years will be automatically controlled as follows: In the two years of Showa 12 and 13, the total will be 355 million yards. (However, the amount shipped by Japan in Showa 12 shall not exceed 180 million yards.) Regarding the resolution of various issues in the Japan-US cotton industry trade, the Japan-US Cotton Industry Council will be established in New York and Osaka as a permanent organization. Other detailed conditions attached to this agreement will continue to be negotiated and decided from the 22nd. Looking at the contents of this agreement, considering that last year's US requirement for self-restraint before raising tariffs on Japanese cotton cloth was only 45 million yards, and that last year, Japan shipped 73,512,000 yards of cotton cloth to the United States, it is known that although this agreement is the result of concessions on both sides, it can be said to be quite successful for Japan. (22nd Allied Dispatch)

### Severe Flooding in the Midwestern United States

River Waters Overflow, Affecting Ten States

[New York] Ten states, including Pennsylvania, are submerged by floods. Electrical power is cut off, causing darkness and a shortage of drinking water. To date, in the Ohio River basin, 80,000 people are homeless. In Lawrence, Indiana, 7,000 people have fled their homes. The town's levee broke today, spanning half a mile, turning the entire town into a swamp. In Louisville, Ohio, factories sounded sirens today, ordering the public to quickly evacuate danger zones, as they prepared to open the sluice gates to save the million-dollar, tall-footed levee. Part of the town will be flooded as a result. The water has already breached the levee, and if the gates are not opened, there is a risk the levee will collapse. Authorities in the ten states are now reporting heavy snow losses, causing the river water to rise even higher. Flood damage in Cincinnati has reached one million dollars. All railways are unable to operate on schedule. The current water level of the Ohio River in that state is more than fifteen and a half feet higher than the last flood. The large and small rivers in the disaster areas have risen to unprecedented heights. All kinds of industries have come to a standstill. There are now fears of fires and epidemics, which will further exacerbate the hardships of the people. To date, the number of deaths caused by the floods has reached eighty-two.

Follow-up Dispatch The sluice gates in Portsmouth were opened at 3:00 AM to divert the floodwaters, flooding commercial areas to save the entire town. After the gates were opened, water poured into the streets, immersing shops and factories. 1,300 merchants and workers living in that area evacuated overnight. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Statement by the Japanese Military

Attacking Political Parties Hinders Japan's Progress

[Tokyo] The Army authorities issued the following unofficial statement late on the 21st, expressing their belief: "Observing the current state of existing political parties through the atmosphere and speeches within the Diet today, their attitude remains the same as before, disregarding themselves and focusing solely on attacking others. It is completely impossible for the military to carry out a renewal of general administration with such political parties. If existing political parties have concrete plans and oppose the current renewal of general administration, that could be forgiven. However, they verbally advocate for the renewal of general administration while forgetting the surging reform intentions that arose after the February 26th Incident, and they have no concrete plans. Such actions by political parties, using the renewal of general administration as a pretext to maintain the status quo, hinder Japan's progress and instead invite its decline. This not only impedes Japan's role as a stabilizing force in East Asia but also turns it into an isolated island nation. Whether Japan can fulfill the mission the Japanese nation should undertake in this state is a question that the 90 million citizens must resolve through criticism. Political parties that have traditionally used party interests and strategies as tactics, disregarding national and public welfare, have now been placed under national scrutiny and have completely abandoned their value for continued existence. The realization of true parliamentary politics that conforms to the Constitution, and that parliamentary politics correctly recognizes its position, must first address the solution of important issues such as clarifying the national essence, strengthening national defense, promoting industry, and stabilizing the people's lives. Is this not the only path for the regeneration of existing political parties? In short, the current situation is a conflict between maintaining the status quo and breaking the status quo. The victory of the faction that breaks the status quo is the victory of the renewal of general administration. If existing political parties do not recognize this current state, they will inevitably face a state of disintegration." (Allied Press, 22nd)

### Police Deployed

To Protect the Safety of Cabinet Members

[Nanjing] Today, the entire police force was ordered to deploy to protect cabinet members and those who spoke in the Diet yesterday. This indicates that the Japanese political situation is currently extremely tense. Army Minister Terauchi, Vice Minister Isoya, and other high-ranking officials consulted and then returned to Japan to meet with Chief of the Army General Staff Prince Kan'in. It is reported that the Army Minister reiterated his claim that if the political parties do not reconsider their attitudes, the Diet should be dissolved. Navy Minister Mizuno held a meeting last night with key officials from the Ministry of the Navy and resolved to support the Army Minister's attitude. (Reuters)

### Japanese Cabinet Yields to Military Pressure, Decides to Dissolve the Diet

Military Leaders Exhibit High Arrogance Major Blow to the Parliamentary System

[Tokyo] The Japanese Cabinet held an emergency cabinet meeting this morning and finally decided that the imperial decree to dissolve the Diet may be issued tomorrow. (Central News Agency, 22nd)

[Nanjing] The government decided on the 23rd to petition the Emperor of Japan to issue an imperial decree dissolving the Diet. (Allied Press, 22nd)

[Tokyo] The Cabinet's policy has decided to dissolve the Diet, and it will petition for the promulgation of the imperial decree on the 23rd. (Allied Press, 22nd)

[Tokyo] The Cabinet held an emergency meeting today that lasted for four hours and finally yielded to pressure from the military, resolving to petition the Emperor to issue an edict dissolving the Diet. However, it will hold another meeting tomorrow afternoon to confirm this, indicating that the Cabinet hopes to intimidate the political parties into abandoning their hostile attitude towards the government. However, the political parties are also not showing weakness, believing that the House of Representatives can hold a vote to pass a huge military budget, forcing Army Minister Terauchi, who is demanding the dissolution of the Diet, to comply. If the Cabinet does not petition for the dissolution of the Diet, the only option is to resign. If the Diet is dissolved, it will be a great victory for Army Minister Terauchi and other military leaders, and the parliamentary system will suffer a major blow. (Reuters, 22nd)

[Tokyo] Due to the intense debates between Hamada and Terauchi yesterday, the Japanese government decided late yesterday to suspend the Diet for two days. All direct conflicts between the Hirota Cabinet and the political parties have become unavoidable. The Diet had only convened for one day, and the questioning on general issues had not yet been completed when it was suspended for two days, which is almost unprecedented. The main point of Hamada's speech yesterday was to criticize the Hirota Cabinet for relying on the military as its sole driving force, thus creating a fear of fascism and dictatorial politics. It is reported that the Japanese government has realized that not a single Diet member defended the government in yesterday's Diet session, and although the attitude of the Minseito Party was relatively moderate, they also severely criticized the government on issues of tax increases and diplomacy. Other small parties expressed strong opposition to the government, sparing no effort. The idea of dissolving the Diet was rampant as soon as the Diet adjourned last night. It is said that because cabinet members belonging to the Seiyukai and Minseito parties opposed the dissolution of the Diet, the decision was made to suspend the Diet for two days. (Central News Agency, 22nd)

[Tokyo] At today's Cabinet meeting on the 22nd, it was decided to dissolve the Diet, but the formal decision must be announced at the Cabinet meeting on the 23rd. The government has now decided not to have any affiliated parties and to resolutely implement the dissolution. The reason for their consensus is that the military believes that if they want to urge the current political parties to reflect, there is no other way than dissolution. Their opinion is extremely strong. Furthermore, Prime Minister Hirota also expressed his agreement, as the government is not confident in obtaining a majority as a result of the dissolution. It is also possible that they will implement a total resignation as a result of the election. Some cabinet members believe that the division of political parties will change during this general election, and that the current military should seek coordination with other forces to achieve a renewal of general administration. There are also not a few who advocate maintaining the status quo, immediately reviving party politics, and causing a decomposition effect. In short, the division of political parties and the trends in the political world after the Diet is dissolved are extremely noteworthy developments in the future. (Allied Press, 22nd)

### Emergency Cabinet Meeting

Army Minister Terauchi Advocates Dissolving the Diet Struggles with His Own Resignation to Argue His Case

[Tokyo] After the House of Representatives meeting adjourned on the 21st, the government convened a temporary emergency meeting in the Diet. Army Minister Terauchi spoke first, stating that based on today's deliberations in the House of Representatives, the parties each sent two members into the cabinet and took an anti-government stance while in the position of the government party. Under these circumstances, it is difficult for the Diet to conclude satisfactorily, and the government should make a major decision. The Army Minister strongly advocated for the immediate dissolution of the Diet, urging the cabinet members to make a decision. Cabinet members from the parties, such as Maeda, Shimada, Yorimotoki, and Ogawa, unanimously opposed the Army Minister's argument for dissolving the Diet, saying that although there were some anti-government opinions in the Diet, they did not reach the point of no confidence in the current cabinet, so there was no reason to dissolve the Diet. The government should make efforts to pass the budget bill through the Diet. As a result, the atmosphere in the cabinet meeting was extremely tense. Army Minister Terauchi insisted on his own views and implied the issue of his own resignation while advocating for the dissolution of the Diet. However, the result was a decision to petition the Emperor of Japan to suspend the meeting for two days to seek reflection from the Diet. (Allied Press, 22nd)

[Tokyo] The cabinet meeting to decide whether to resign en masse or dissolve the Diet began at 10:30 this morning and has not yet adjourned as of 2:00 PM. Before the cabinet meeting, the general opinion of all cabinet members, except those affiliated with political parties, tended towards dissolving the Diet. Army Minister Terauchi held an emergency meeting with the heads of the Ministry of the Army at 9:00 this morning and decided on a tough proposal to submit to the cabinet meeting this morning. Terauchi then visited Chief of Staff Prince Kan'in to report on the military's proposal. Navy Minister Nagano also convened a meeting of the heads of the Ministry of the Navy before the cabinet meeting. The people across the nation are calmly awaiting the decision of today's cabinet, and the political atmosphere is extremely tense. According to general observations here, a total resignation of the Hirota Cabinet is more likely, and it is pointed out that the suspension of the Diet is sufficient to increase the suspicions of Diet members. Since the government has no political parties to follow its lead on one hand, and the Minseito Party is unwilling to support it on the other, there is practically no room for negotiation and compromise. If the results of the re-election after the Diet is dissolved are even more difficult to predict, it would be more legitimate to resign immediately rather than wait for a collapse. However, the attitude of the military is extremely tough, insisting on dissolving the Diet to avoid unfortunate incidents. The military believes that if the results of the re-election prove to be unfavorable to the government, it would not be too late to submit its resignation again. Which of the above opinions Hirota will accept is the biggest question at present. The political parties are sitting on pins and needles, neither ignoring the dissolution of the Diet nor seeking a compromise with the government. In short, the total resignation of the Cabinet or the dissolution of the Diet has a broad and subtle relationship to Japan's domestic politics today. A situation may now develop in which the government, while fully recognizing that it has no choice but to resign, still decides to dissolve the Diet first. (Central News Agency, 22nd)

### Political Parties Adopt a Tough Stance

Military Attempts to Break the Status Quo Hirota Cabinet May Not Last Long

[Tokyo] Although the Cabinet meeting decided today to dissolve the Diet, it did not formally pass a resolution to dissolve the Diet. A final decision will not be made until the cabinet meeting tomorrow afternoon, so there is still one day for compromise negotiations. The Seiyukai and Minseito parties are extremely agitated by the government's decision to suspend the Diet for two days and have convened meetings to decide on a tough stance, instructing their respective cabinet members today not to agree to the dissolution of the Diet. At this final moment, the possible attitudes of the four cabinet members from the political parties are attracting general attention. It is reported that at today's cabinet meeting, Army Minister Terauchi, Education Minister Hirao, Finance Minister Baba, and Colonial Affairs Minister Nagata advocated for the dissolution of the Diet most strongly, while Agriculture Minister Torda and Communications Minister Ogawa opposed the proposal. The reasons why the military insists on dissolving the Diet can be summarized as follows: It is extremely clear that the existing political parties are not suitable for jointly implementing the task of "renewing general administration." Therefore, the government should absolutely not compromise with the existing political parties. If the political parties do not change their attitudes, there is no alternative but to dissolve the Diet. Although the political parties use the renewal of general administration as a pretext, they are in fact attempting to maintain the status quo from a liberal perspective. From the perspective of both domestic and foreign affairs, this is equivalent to abandoning the entire continental policy, which is difficult for the people to approve. Regardless of the number of existing political parties, they clearly cannot represent the people of the entire country. Therefore, the military has determined that dissolving the Diet is extremely important. By observing the military's reasons for dissolving the Diet, we can understand the basis for the opinion to dissolve the Diet and the future trends of Japanese politics. The head-on collision between the military and the political parties is so urgent that it is difficult to predict the outcome. At the same time, the opinion of "breaking the status quo" is also extremely important. Since the government has no affiliated parties in the House of Representatives, and the majority of members in the House of Peers are also opposed to the government (as can be proved by the questions raised by the parties on the first day of the Diet's reopening), general observations here believe that the Cabinet has absolutely no hope of winning, and the act of dissolution is also difficult. It is also believed that the movement to create a new cabinet is currently quite active, attempting to seize the possible opportunity to disintegrate the existing political parties. If this movement is successful, the government, with strong support as its backing, may be able to gather some supporters. Although this hope is not entirely unfounded, it is unlikely to be realized, as organizing a new party is not easy, and obtaining a majority of support is even more difficult. Even if they can obtain some supporters, it will be of no help. Therefore, some people predict that the Hirota Cabinet will ultimately be unable to maintain its position and will be forced to resign after the general election. There are now various speculations about the candidates for the successor to the Cabinet. In short, the goal of this dissolution of the Diet is ambiguous and unclear, and the government's victory is also hopeless. It is generally believed that the goal of dissolving the Diet is inexplicable. (Central News Agency, 22nd)

### Seiyukai Party

Resentful of Government's Suppression of Speech Considering Future Actions to Be Taken

[Tokyo] The Seiyukai convened an emergency executive meeting at its headquarters at 1:00 PM on the 22nd. The party's elders, advisors, executives, secretary-general, and chairman of the Policy Research Council all attended. Focusing on the issue of the suspension of the Diet, the party unanimously resolved on the following items regarding the party's attitude: (1) The party believes that the Diet being suspended right at the beginning is an act by the government to suppress speech, and there is no greater illegality. (2) In view of the true meaning of constitutional government, cabinet members from our party must not agree to the dissolution of the Diet.

After the meeting passed the above two proposals, it continued to hold an emergency meeting of Diet members at the party headquarters at 2:00 PM, unanimously approving the above resolutions without any objections. The secretary-general then immediately visited the cabinet members from the party, delivered the above resolution documents, and requested that they act in accordance with their consistent policy. (Allied Press, 22nd)

### Minseito Party Temporarily Adopts a Wait-and-See Approach

[Tokyo] In order to decide on its attitude towards this dissolution of the Diet, the Minseito Party convened a general affairs meeting at its headquarters at 1:00 PM on the 22nd. Executive personnel all attended. First, Yorimotoki, Minister of Communications, reported on the internal situation of the government. He did not mention the delicate movements within the cabinet, the Minister's own advancement or retreat, or the relationship with the party, remaining completely isolated. Next, Saito Takao argued that what should be questioned by the government should still be questioned, and what should be reviewed should still be reviewed, and then an attitude should be decided. Finally, Koizumi Matajiro spoke of adopting a wait-and-see attitude and not acting rashly, which was endorsed by his colleagues. A meeting of Diet members was convened at 3:00 PM, and Koizumi's views were explained. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. (Allied Press, 22nd)

### Financial Circles Sympathize with Political Parties

Oppose Strengthening Dictatorial Politics Public Sentiment Unsettled, Market in Disarray

[Tokyo] The Diet, which reopened in a tense atmosphere on the 22nd, has shown a dangerous state due to the unexpectedly tough attitude of the political parties. The government has therefore petitioned for a two-day recess. The impressions received by the financial community, especially the industrial and financial sectors, are generally as follows: The financial community expresses sympathy for the attitude of the political parties and hopes that the huge budget and laws concerning various industries will be thoroughly revised. However, the government's two-day recess has deepened the state of anxiety in the political world, causing a major shock to the financial community, making it difficult to see through the future situation, and paying close attention to the development of the political situation. Since the past three or four years, industrial capitalists who have reaped huge profits by taking advantage of the wartime boom have been greatly alarmed by the government's unprecedented budget of 3 billion yuan. Although Finance Minister Baba's speech yesterday was optimistic about the future of finance, the current state of Japan's industrial economy is actually the opposite of the Finance Minister's speech, proving the fact that it cannot accept the current fiscal policy, and the ruinous phenomenon of malignant inflation is considered a sign that the wartime boom has reached a dangerous point. As a result, the financial community has resolutely adopted a general anti-government attitude, and this influence has affected the tough attitude of the political parties, making them increasingly anti-government. However, the Diet's sudden two-day recess and the instability of the political situation suggest that the financial community has no firm conviction or countermeasures for this. The financial sector has always opposed the government's strengthening of dictatorial politics and its disregard for the sudden policies of the economic sector. At the same time, it is very concerned about the attitude of the political parties and hopes to criticize the current cabinet's administration. However, the sudden deterioration of the political situation has greatly shocked it, and it is now making every effort to avoid the instability of the political situation. However, the stock market and commodity market are inevitably affected to a considerable extent. (Allied Press, 22nd)

[Tokyo] It is difficult to predict the future direction of the political situation after the dissolution of the Diet. Although the stock market is currently paying attention to its future, the high prices have led to a continuous sell-off by those who bought at high prices. As a result, mainstay stocks such as New Eastern have fallen from above 150 yuan to 49.10 yuan, a sharp drop of 14 yuan from the high price of 63.60 yuan a day or two ago. Kanebo stocks also fell sharply by around 10 yuan, and other stocks continued to fall to 3 or 5 yuan. As the future of the political situation is unpredictable, public sentiment is extremely shaken. In particular, rumors of the Army Minister's resignation have further fueled the selling pressure. The financial community is generally anxious, and this trend is quite strong. (Allied Press, 22nd)

### Japanese Diet Members Form a Neutral New Group

Named the Hokuto Club

[Tokyo] Diet members Hara Kinji, Imai Shinzo, Koyama Ryo, Tanaka Ko, and others gathered at Koyama's residence on the night of the 21st to discuss the formation of a purely neutral new group, named the Hokuto Club, and issued a statement announcing the establishment of this new association on the 22nd.

Concurrently Served by the Minister to Japan

[Mexico City] Foreign Minister Roa recently held talks with Chinese Minister Huang Yunsu, and it was agreed to send a minister to China, with Shanghai as the location of the embassy. As for the selection of the minister, it will likely be General Agilaras, the Mexican Minister to Japan, who will serve concurrently for the time being. (Havas, 21st)

### The Qingdao Match Merchants' Industry Dispute is Becoming Increasingly Serious

The Match Joint Office Opposes the Monopoly and Control of the Joint Venture Society, Submitting Appeals to Various Authorities and Sending Representatives for Petitions

A communication from Qingdao reports that the Qingdao branch of the National Match Joint Venture Society is about to be established. However, eighteen match factories including Luxi and Zhendong in Shandong Province are opposing the Qingdao branch of the joint venture, which they believe threatens the industry by monopolizing and controlling it. They have organized a joint office to prepare for resistance. Investigations reveal that the joint office agrees with the principle of establishing a joint venture society. However, they believe that the society's articles of association and the agreements made with foreign merchants contain elements of monopoly, control, and damage to national industry. They have repeatedly petitioned the central, provincial, and municipal authorities to order corrections, but the issue has not been resolved after years of contention. On November 16th and 17th last year, the Ministry of Finance convened a meeting at the Tax Bureau, with representatives from the Ministry of Industry and the Joint Venture Society attending. It was decided that all Chinese match factories that had not joined the joint venture must join by January 20th of this year. Otherwise, the Ministry of Industry would revoke their registration, and the Ministry of Finance would stop selling flower labels and issuing licenses. This decision was telegraphed to the Joint Venture Society headquarters, which forwarded it to the match merchants for compliance. After receiving this notification, the joint office of eighteen factories including Luxi and Zhendong in Shandong Province immediately convened an emergency meeting and decided to struggle and make a final sacrifice. They resolved to submit appeals to the Administrative and Supervisory Yuan, and send declarations of denial to the Ministries of Finance and Industry. They also sent representatives to the provincial and municipal governments to petition. Furthermore, they resolved that if the government did not understand their plight and proceeded to revoke registrations and stop selling flower labels and issuing licenses, leading to factory closures and unemployment, the joint office factories would not be responsible. Observing the current situation, the dispute between the two sides is likely to become increasingly serious. According to statistics, the eighteen factories employ directly and indirectly no less than 100,000 workers. If they are forced to shut down due to this dispute, society will be affected, which is an important issue that cannot be ignored. The petitions submitted by the joint office to various authorities are listed below.

Petition to the Administrative and Supervisory Yuan: Regarding the Match Production and Sales Joint Venture Society's Deceptive Reporting and Threatening of the Industry, a Critical Situation, and the Imminent Risk of Bankruptcy. A Humble Request for a Thorough Investigation and Protection, and an Order to the Relevant Authorities to Modify the Proposal and Seek a Fair and Appropriate Solution to Benefit Manufacturers and Maintain Industry. The eighteen factories unanimously agree with the principle of joint ventures. However, the society's articles of association and the agreements negotiated with Japanese counterparts contain elements of monopoly, control, subservience to foreign interests, and self-inflicted harm, making them difficult to accept. We have already refuted them point by point and submitted opinions in writing, requesting your esteemed Yuan to order a halt to and correction of these issues. However, after years of appeals, our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. Our legitimate requests have not been adopted by the society or addressed appropriately by the relevant authorities. The situation is deeply worrying, as it concerns our very survival. We have now received telegram No. 5770 from the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, forwarded by the National Production and Sales Joint Venture Society. Upon reading it, we were extremely perplexed and astonished. The reason why the eighteen factories have been cautiously considering and hesitant to join the joint venture is entirely due to the monopolistic policies of the society, in which powerful manufacturers collude with foreigners to suppress their domestic counterparts. This places the majority of small factories in a position of constant aggression and oppression, unable to breathe freely. Even the Huai Shang Minsheng factories in the Central China region deeply feel the insidious nature of these articles of association and agreements, making it impossible for small factories to survive. The facts are clear and can be proven. However, the society brazenly disregards this, showing no sincerity in repenting its errors. The articles of association are treated as if they were divinely ordained, with not a single word allowed to be modified. The measures are dictated unilaterally, with factories not allowed to express their opinions. They even use the fact that the Sino-Japanese agreement has been filed with the four ministries as their sole means of intimidation, leading to a long-term stalemate in the joint venture. The responsibility for this naturally lies with the society. At the Ministry of Finance meeting on November 16th and 17th last year, only the responsible personnel from the society were invited to attend and explain the situation, without notifying the factories to state their opinions. Since only one side was heard, it is no wonder that the society was able to deceive with false pretenses and malicious speculation. From a rational and reasonable perspective, how can this be considered fair? Furthermore, the so-called separate corrections and necessary rectifications mentioned in the meeting of the Ministries of Finance and Industry only relate to the production ratios of each district and factory and their calculation methods. The telegram does not mention how the articles of association will be modified or whether the agreement can be salvaged. The society's letter also does not mention this. Moreover, what is the extent of the so-called separate corrections? Will the preferential rights of the Japanese side be revoked, and will everyone be treated equally? And have the points that need to be corrected been corrected? And are they suitable for the balanced development of factories of all sizes, without containing monopoly, control, or selfish agendas? This is what we are worried about and cannot understand. The Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, without investigating the nature of this dispute and the reasons why the factories refuse to join, is using coercive means to force all factories to join the joint venture by February 1st. If they fail to join by the deadline, their registrations will be revoked, flower label sales will be stopped, and no further extensions will be granted. This seems to be complying with the requests of the powerful manufacturers in the society, completely disregarding the interests and survival of the eighteen factories, and does not seem to be the government's intention to treat all factories equally. If the society's organization of the joint venture is truly aimed at rescuing the industry, all factories would readily join without the need for government coercion. Otherwise, with so much capital and enterprise at stake, it would be better to struggle and make the ultimate sacrifice than to be forced to join, be controlled by others, and cut off our own means of survival. The factories have repeatedly stated that they will never join the society until its articles of association are corrected. We hope that you will understand that the Ministry of Finance is in charge of tax revenue and protecting manufacturers, while the Ministry of Industry promotes industry and focuses on people's livelihoods. Since we have already been registered, you should be able to clearly understand the reasons and difficulties of the factories that refuse to join and grant us your understanding. If you do not understand the situation and mistakenly believe the society's slanderous remarks that refusing to join is equivalent to opposing the joint venture and attempting to smuggle, and proceed to implement the decision and not grant any further extensions, we will only wait for the government's decision. However, for the sake of the future of industry and the social economy, the stakes are high. The unemployment of hundreds of thousands of workers is an extremely serious problem in the region. At a time when the rural economy is collapsing and the market is depressed, and after repeated disasters, small-scale factories should be encouraged and protected, not subjected to wanton destruction that cuts off their own means of survival. We have always admired your advocacy for industry and focus on people's livelihoods. You would never sit idly by and watch as the factories are manipulated and controlled by capitalists, leading to their demise, without lending a helping hand. The situation is critical, and we are presenting our case. We humbly request your esteemed Yuan to conduct a thorough investigation and protection, and order the relevant authorities to modify the proposal and seek a legitimate solution to benefit manufacturers and maintain industry. The livelihoods of the people and the stability of the region depend on it.

Petition to the Authorities of Shandong and Qingdao: Regarding the Match Joint Venture Society's Deceptive Reporting to the Government and Threatening of the Industry, a Critical Situation, and the Imminent Risk of Bankruptcy. A Humble Request for Prompt Protection and a Forwarding of the Proposal to the Relevant Authorities to Modify the Proposal and Seek a Solution to Benefit Manufacturers and Maintain Industry. The eighteen factories unanimously agree with the principle of joint ventures. However, the society's articles of association and the agreements made with Japanese counterparts contain elements of monopoly, control, subservience to foreign interests, and self-inflicted harm, which should be rectified and corrected to align with the original intention of rescuing the industry. Last year, when Liu Hongsheng came to Qingdao, we personally presented to you the illegal and power-abdicating points in the articles of association and agreements, refuted them point by point, and submitted reasons, requesting your government to provide relief and forward the request to the relevant authorities to order corrections. Whether the articles of association and agreements are fair and reasonable, whether there is truly no selfishness in exclusivity and subservience to foreign interests, and whether the reasons for our refutation are sufficient and have value for consideration, and whether we are truly attempting to subvert the joint venture with other agendas, as the society falsely accuses us of, will become clear through comparison and verification. This is something that Your Excellency will be able to discern clearly and does not need to be repeated. Unexpectedly, our legitimate requests have not been adopted by the society. Even if Your Excellency suggests a compromise between the two sides, Liu Hongsheng will not accept it. The situation is deeply worrying, as it concerns our very survival. On January 9th of this year, we suddenly received a letter from the Joint Venture Society stating that the Ministry of Finance had issued order No. 5770, and that the Ministry had convened a meeting at the Tax Bureau on November 16th and 17th, 1936, with representatives from the Ministry of Industry attending, to conduct a thorough study and impartial review, and had notified the responsible personnel of the society to attend and explain the situation. The two ministries decided that all Chinese match factories that had not joined the joint venture would be granted an extension until January 20th, 1937, and must join the society by February 1st. If any factories still failed to join by February 1st, the Ministry of Industry would revoke their registration, and the Ministry of Finance would stop selling flower labels and issuing licenses, and no further extensions would be granted. We were also informed that the order had been forwarded to the match factories for compliance. Upon reading it, we were extremely perplexed and astonished. The reason why the eighteen factories have been hesitating to join the joint venture is entirely due to the monopolistic policies of the society, in which powerful manufacturers collude with foreigners to suppress their domestic counterparts. This places the majority of small factories in a position of constant aggression and oppression, unable to breathe freely. Even the Huai Shang Minsheng factories in the Central China region deeply feel the insidious nature of these articles of association and agreements, making it impossible for small factories to survive. The facts are clear and known to everyone. However, the society shows no sincerity in repenting its errors and disregards the interests of the factories. Specifically, the society is unwilling to loosen its grip on the restrictions and oppression imposed on the factories through the articles of association and agreements, leading to a long-term stalemate in the joint venture. The responsibility for this naturally lies with the society. At the Ministry of Finance meeting on November 16th and 17th last year, only the responsible personnel from the society were invited to attend and explain the situation, without notifying the factories to state their opinions. Since only one side was heard, it is no wonder that the society was able to deceive with false pretenses and malicious speculation. From a rational and reasonable perspective, how can this be considered fair? Whether the society's articles of association have been corrected, whether the humiliating and power-abdicating points in the agreement have been salvaged, the minutes of the meeting have not been made public, and the society's letter has not notified us. The telegram only mentions that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, based on the above decision, have separately corrected the production ratio calculation tables submitted by the society, and extracted the details of the meeting and the points that need to be corrected, and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval and filing. How exactly are the calculation tables corrected? Will the Japanese merchants' increased production quotas be revoked, and will everyone be treated equally? And have the points that need to be corrected been corrected? And are they suitable for the balanced development of factories of all sizes, without containing monopoly, control, or selfish agendas? This is what we are worried about and cannot understand. However, the previous decision of the Ministries of Finance and Industry, in order to rescue the match industry and prevent smuggling and tax evasion, forces all factories to join the joint venture and revokes the registrations and stops the sale of flower labels for those who do not join by the deadline, so that the powerful manufacturers in the society can exploit them at will, while disregarding the interests and survival of the eighteen factories. This does not seem to be the government's intention to treat all factories equally. If the powerful manufacturers in the society and their articles of association and agreements truly aim to rescue the industry, all factories would readily join without the need for government coercion. Otherwise, with so much capital and enterprise at stake, it would be better to struggle and make the ultimate sacrifice than to be forced to join, be controlled by others, and cut off our own means of survival. The factories have repeatedly stated that they will never join the society until its articles of association are corrected. We hope that you will understand that the Ministry of Finance is in charge of tax revenue and protecting manufacturers, while the Ministry of Industry promotes industry and focuses on people's livelihoods. Since we have already been registered, you should be able to clearly understand the reasons and difficulties of the factories that refuse to join and grant us your understanding. If you do not understand the situation and mistakenly believe the society's slanderous remarks that we are opposing the joint venture and have other agendas, and proceed to revoke our registrations and stop the sale of flower labels without granting any extensions, the eighteen factories are financially weak and can only wait for the government's decision. However, for the sake of the future of industry and the social economy, the stakes are high. The unemployment of hundreds of thousands of workers is an extremely serious problem in the province and city. The factories will have unspeakable suffering. We have always admired our Chairman and Mayor for their care for manufacturers and their great concern. At a time when factories are being subjected to hardship and suppression, you would never sit idly by and watch as the eighteen factories are manipulated and controlled by capitalists, leading to their demise, without lending a helping hand. The situation is critical, and we are presenting our case. We humbly request Your Excellency to grant us protection and promptly consult with the relevant authorities to modify the proposal and seek a legitimate solution to benefit manufacturers and maintain industry. The livelihoods of the people and the stability of the region depend on it.

### Engineering Conditions of the Xuan-Gui Section of the Nanjing-Jiangxi Railway

The Engineering Bureau Sends Personnel to Inspect the Road and Bridges Along the Line. Construction of the Southern Qimen Road Can Also Begin Within Days.

A communication from Tunxi reports that the Jing-Quzhou Railway, which connects the Jiangnan and Zhejiang-Jiangxi railways, was changed to the Nanjing-Jiangxi Railway after Quzhou was abandoned. Except for the section from Nanjing to Sunjiabu in Xuancheng, which has already been opened to traffic, the northern section of the road from Ningguo to Qimen is progressing rapidly. It is scheduled to be completed from Ningguo to Xiuning by March of this year. The eastern part of Xuxi has already been built. The eighth section from Huizhou to Yansi has also started construction. The ninth section from Yansi (in Shexian County) to Xiuning is also being prepared. The Engineering Bureau of the Xuancheng-Guixi section, in order to understand the route and bridges along the line so as to speed up construction, recently sent engineers Wang Huaiyong and Li Rongzhai to Xiuning to inspect the tenth section from Xiuning to Yuting (in the territory of Huoxian County) and the eleventh section from Yuting to Jinzipai (in the territory of Qimen County). Construction of the southern Qimen road at Houtan, Guixi, Rongkou, and Daohu can begin within 20 days. Recently, the General Engineering Bureau shipped various materials to Qimen. The Twelfth Engineering Office of the fourth and fifth teams stationed in Qimen has hired a large number of road workers, about 10,000 people, from Beiping to wait for instructions. However, the northern section of the road from Ningguo to Xiuning will soon be laid with tracks, requiring a large number of sleepers. The Shexian sleeper procurement office plans to purchase a total of 10,000 sleepers, with each timber merchant responsible for procuring them separately, with 20% to be delivered in March and 40% in each of April and May (January 18th).

### Suzhou Urges the Remittance of 200,000 Provincial Funds

The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, with the Lunar New Year approaching and the province urgently in need of funds, specially sent Su Cengyi to Suzhou on the 22nd to urge the county government to remit 200,000 yuan in provincial funds. After negotiations with County Magistrate Deng, it was agreed that 200,000 yuan would be remitted before the end of January. After completing his mission, Su went to Kunshan that night to also urge the remittance of provincial funds.

Borrowing Funds to Build a New Suzhou

The Wuxian Construction Bureau, regarding the major construction plan for the Wuxian urban area this year, the reconstruction of the four city gates of Xu, Pan, Lou, and Qi, the opening and widening of major trunk roads in the city, and the reconstruction of bridges, estimates that the total cost will be over 290,000 yuan.

### Two Accountants from the Changzhou County Bureau Go Missing

Wu Nan (Zi Ziwen), the accountant of the Wuyi Education Bureau, is over 60 years old and has been working in the bureau for over ten years. Recently, due to heavy personal consumption, he embezzled the education funds he was in charge of. Over time, by the end of 1935, he owed as much as 12,000 yuan. The bureau did not notice. Starting in 1936, Jin Guoping was reassigned by the Department of Education to fill the position of accountant in the Education Bureau. Wu, unable to make up the shortfall and hand over the accounts, fled on the 15th of this month as the Lunar New Year approached. The bureau is investigating. At the same time, his son Wu Ruihua, who was the treasurer of the county government (also the accountant), who usually handled a large amount of money and was always conscientious, unexpectedly fled on the 17th of this month. Before leaving, he left a note in the office that read, "Alas! Alas! Alas! From now on, the world will have one less honest person." Afterwards, the county government summoned his guarantor to the government, and together they liquidated the funds he had handled. It was not easy to clarify for a while. The position of treasurer of the First Section has been temporarily filled by Zhuge Cheng. It is also reported that Wu Nan, the accountant of the Education Bureau, and Wu Ruihua, the treasurer of the county government (Wu Nan's son), have successively embezzled funds and fled. Wu Nan has been in the bureau for more than ten years. The director has changed nine times, but the accountant has not been changed, so there is no guarantor. The embezzlement is about 12,000 yuan. Director Sun Youguang telegraphed the county government and forwarded it to the Department of Education, requesting that personnel be sent to investigate thoroughly and requesting punishment himself. The county government has ordered Director Sun to find out Wu Nan's property in order to seal it up. The Department of Education immediately sent staff members Zhu Maogong and Rui Jun to Changzhou on the 21st. They inspected the accounts at the Education Bureau on the 22nd and will stay for several days. His son, Wu Ruihua, also has a deficit in the county government.

However, the amount of the deficit has not yet been clarified. The county magistrate took a car to the province early on the morning of the 22nd to ask for instructions on how to handle it.

### Zi Lin Cup Final Today: Youyou and Measurement Vie for the Championship

The Match will be at 2:30 PM at the Hongkou Park Stadium. In Group A, Jinnan Faces Portuguese Merchants, and Western Merchants Changed to Fighting St. Francis.

The two teams, Youyou and Measurement, which have won the right to compete in the Zi Lin Cup final, are scheduled to hold the final at the first stadium of Hongkou Park at 2:30 PM this afternoon. Youyou has had a good record since it started the competition. In the semi-finals, it defeated its only strong rival, Zhen Dan. At the same time, the Russian army, which formed a three-legged stance, was resolved by the Measurement team, which was unknown in the league, indirectly providing Youyou with a lot of convenience. The Russian army's record in the league is above Youyou's. Now that it has been eliminated by the Measurement team, and Youyou's strength is far beyond that of the Measurement team, Youyou can rest assured about the championship. There are three matches in Group A of the Western League today. The match between Western Police and Su Keer is expected to be a tough battle because Gaxu Dang will be absent. Although the Portuguese army is in decline, Jinnan Wang Nanzhen, Yin Guiren, Yan Lianjin, and other pillars are now on a grand tour to the south. It is bound to be supplemented by Group B players, so the victory may belong to the Portuguese merchants. In another match, the Western Merchants were originally scheduled to play against Lax. Because three players from the Lax team were selected for the inter-port competition, it will be difficult to attend the league at that time. Therefore, Western Merchants changed to fighting St. Francis. There is also a Group C match, between Yousheng and Savaia. The Savaia team has already won the championship in Group C, but Yousheng has also been very aggressive recently and has the ambition to defeat the Savaia team. The schedule and lineups of each team today are as follows:

Youyou Team (Zi Cup Final)

### News Communication Fails, Five Dragons Triumph

26 to 17 – Five Dragons Always Ahead

Originally, there were two basketball games scheduled for yesterday at Zhongyuan. However, the Division B Group 1 match between the Yidui team and Moore, scheduled for 6:30 PM, was postponed. Only the Group A game between Five Dragons and News Communication took place. News Communication recently gained success against Xiqing and didn't take Five Dragons seriously. Consequently, Lan Yin, Pisele, Shi Guiya, and others didn't play. However, Five Dragons was not a weak team. Wu Bixian and Xu Zhaoxiong coordinated their play with incredible skill, preventing Carson from performing effectively. After the match began, Xu Zhaoxiong scored first, followed by two baskets from Wu Bixian. Then, Wang Zhenlun added one free throw, giving Five Dragons a 7-0 lead. Although News Communication had Carson coordinating in the center, they were unsuccessful due to Five Dragons' tight defense. At 5-0, they urgently replaced Mao Nai with Walter, but it didn't help. When Lie Jingfeng committed a foul, Walter scored two free throws, finally adding some points to the scoreboard. Afterwards, Li Zude scored a basket, and Carson also contributed. Wu Bixian scored again, and Walter retaliated in kind, bringing the score to 11-6, with Five Dragons still leading by five points. The situation seemed quite balanced. Soon after, Li Zude scored two more free throws, and Pan Sisi also scored one out of two free throws. Time flew by, and the halftime break arrived. Five Dragons led 13-7 in the first half. In the second half, Wu Bixian successfully scored from the perimeter. Walter missed both free throws. After Carson scored, the veteran Nai Bo'er was brought on to replace Pan Ensi, but it didn't improve the situation. For Five Dragons, Xu Zhaoxiong scored a free throw, and Li Zude scored another basket. Lan Jin was unhappy with the referee Zhang Wenyuan, resulting in a technical foul. Xu Zhaoxiong missed the free throw. With victory in sight, Five Dragons called a timeout to maintain their lead. However, after the game resumed, News Communication attacked fiercely, resulting in numerous fouls on both sides. After Mao Nai scored a free throw, Xu and Liu quickly scored three points, bringing the score to 21-10, with Five Dragons holding a clear advantage. Later, Lan Jin and Li Zude each scored. News Communication then brought on Fusi Tuo. With only five minutes remaining, Li and Fusi Tuo each scored a free throw. Wu Bixian scored under the basket, and Carson also made a solo dash and scored. With even less time remaining, only one minute, Five Dragons, having secured the victory, replaced Xu, Wang, and Li with Zhao Shouchang, Wu Bixin, and Zhou Xuexian for rest. After Carson scored, the final buzzer sounded loudly. In the end, Five Dragons won decisively with a score of 26-17. This was the first time News Communication had lost in Shanghai, except for a loss to a visiting team.

### Amateur Billiards Group A Competition: Zhang Yingda Achieves Great Victory

Demonstrates Divine Skills, Securing Qualification for the Replay – Wins Against Wu Chengqi with 1000 to 571

Zhang Yingda, a leading figure in Chinese billiards, showcased extraordinary skills in two matches yesterday, defeating Wu Chengqi (previously mistakenly reported as Wu Chengxiang) with a score of 1000 to 571 in the Group A billiards championship, securing qualification for the replay.

Zhang's performance in the first half was already excellent, but his fluency and mastery in the second half were truly rare. With a cue in hand, he could do whatever he wanted. The ball would fall as he desired, and openings and other techniques were all under his control. He scored every time, and missing a shot became a rare occurrence. This was truly a masterpiece of Zhang's life. Wu's performance was less stable in the second half than in the first half, but his shots in the middle of the first half were even more brilliant. If he could have continued like that, he would have provided Zhang with a strong competition.

After Zhang scored 27, 29, and 26 in the first three shots, he took the lead. However, he faltered midway, giving Wu a good opportunity to accelerate and catch up. With a 40-point shot, Wu took the lead with 184 to 130. Later, Zhang regained the lead with 207 to 178. After that, it was all Zhang's show. Wu could only try to follow, hoping not to fall too far behind. At the end of the first half, Zhang had 500 points and Wu had 360.

The second half passed smoothly in a one-sided manner. Wu was constantly plagued by bad luck, unable to develop all his skills. Watching Zhang's miraculous shots, every shot was a revelation, and every time there was a way to score. Scores of 20 or more were achieved very easily. Occasionally, Zhang was careless, but good luck would help him, and he would always gain something. Therefore, it only took one and a half hours to reach 500 points.

Zhang Yingda (First Half): 27, 29, 48, 37, 32, 49, 30, 20, 30, 42. (Second Half): 41, 49, 25, 45, 43, 39, 60, 22. Wu Chengqi (First Half): 40, 40. (Second Half): 20, 26, 35.

### The Return of Students Studying in Japan Faces Problems

Those Who Have Not Obtained a Study Abroad Certificate Are Not Considered Students by the State – Japanese Students' Association Asks the Ministry of Education to Issue Certificates

(Tokyo Special Dispatch) Since the qualification issue of our students studying in Japan occurred, students studying in Japan have been running around all day. To this day, the Ministry of Education has not yet determined a convenient solution. Although the authorities also have reasons, the students studying in various universities in Tokyo are now in a great panic because their graduation is approaching and there are indeed problems with their qualifications after returning to the country, which is a great obstacle to their career development. The Federation of Chinese Students Studying in Japan also requested the Ministry of Education to revise the regulations on restrictions on students studying in Japan. The situations of all parties are recorded as follows:

Request to the Ministry of Education

In order to request the Ministry of Education to revise the regulations on restrictions on students studying in Japan, the Federation of Chinese Students Studying in Japan has explored the main points as follows (the original text is very long. For the sake of economic space, its main points are recorded as follows): ㊀ All Chinese students who have studied at schools in Japan, whether or not they have obtained a study abroad certificate, shall be recognized for their academic qualifications and shall be issued a certificate. ㊁ All Chinese students who have graduated from schools in Japan, whether or not they have obtained a study abroad certificate, shall be recognized for their graduation qualifications and shall be issued a certificate. More than two-thirds of all students studying in Japan have not obtained a study abroad certificate. Can the majority of students be ignored? Can the results of the hard work of the majority of students studying in Japan for several years still have no guarantee of life? Therefore, in addition to the above-mentioned main tasks, the Association also has two tasks: First, to request our country's educational institutions and other competent authorities in Japan to effectively protect the safety of all students studying in Japan; Second, to request our country's educational institutions and other competent authorities in Japan to give all students as much freedom as possible in cultural activities and academic research. In order to realize the latter two requirements, it is necessary to first obtain the formal and legal qualifications of students studying abroad (omitted below).

### The Ministry of Education's National Language Association Trains Teachers of Phonetic Symbols

Phonetic Symbol Class Has Started – Also Opens a Shorthand Training School

The Ministry of Education is vigorously implementing mass education this year, continuing to run short-term free schools, and stipulating that textbooks and reading materials must be printed in phonetic Chinese characters. At present, there is an urgent need to train teachers for this. Many teachers in ordinary people's schools and primary schools still lack research on national language phonetic symbols. Therefore, the National Language Alphabet Training School of the National Language Association of the Northern Ministry of Education is taking advantage of the winter vacation to open a phonetic symbol (ie, the first form of the national language alphabet) class. Those who are willing to also learn the national language Romanization (ie, the second form) can also bring lectures. Graduates in three weeks. After passing the exam, the Ministry of Education's National Language Association will issue a certificate so that they can serve as national language teachers in people's schools and primary schools. The Ministry of Communications is also preparing to implement national language telegrams, and there is also a great need for service personnel in this area. The class has already started at 7 o'clock last night. Those who are interested in lecturing can still sign up.

(Another News) The use of national language shorthand has gradually become more widespread. The National Language Shorthand Training School of the National Language Promotion Association of the Ministry of Education has recently been invited to serve as shorthand secretaries or translation talents. The 16th session was opened this time. When recruiting students, it was first thought that it was the cold winter, and the night classes would not be very popular. Unexpectedly, when the class started yesterday, many people joined the school. Those who are enthusiastic about promoting the second form of the national language alphabet, national language Romanization, and a Japanese man from the Institute of Business were also among the students. It is said that the principal of the school used the Wang Yi Simplified Shorthand, which he recently published, as a textbook, and used Wang Yi Simplified Shorthand transcriptions as supplementary tools. Although these books and films are consigned for sale in bookstores such as the Commercial Press and China Bookstore, it is thought that it would be easier to benefit from learning with personal instruction.

### Securities

Large Investors Suddenly Dump Huge Amounts - Class A Plunges Nearly a Yuan This Month

Other Prices Fluctuate Slightly Based on Supply and Demand

Yesterday, the public bond market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was quite lively due to the upcoming settlement period. The market atmosphere was firm and stable. Although there was a significant amount of selling by large investors, there were also many buyers, resulting in a very balanced and smooth flow of chips on the trading floor. Market prices also fluctuated slightly. Large investors suddenly dumped huge amounts, causing market prices to plunge by more than a yuan. Later, due to increased buying interest from retail investors, prices recovered slightly. Today is the last two days of the current month's contract. The battle between bulls and bears is expected to be intense. In the morning, the market opened with calm sentiment, and many retail investors also engaged in deferred transactions. Prices of classes E and D fluctuated by only a few cents. However, when a large amount of classes A, 54, and 10 were suddenly dumped, the market plunged by as much as 50 to 60 cents. In the second session, the market gradually weakened. Number 50 saw selling at every level, and numbers 23 and 37 saw a surge in deferred transactions. Number 35, however, absorbed a significant amount. Classes E and C fell back by 10 to 20 cents. Class A near-term continued to fall by 50.5 cents due to selling of number 77.

### Grains

April Flour also Enters the 4-Yuan Range

Yesterday's flour market saw prices rise first and then fall in the morning. As overseas wheat prices were reported to be up 48 points in Chicago, up 12 cents in Canada, and up 1 penny in Liverpool, prices opened higher, with market sentiment naturally boosted by the slightly higher overseas wheat prices, rising by 1 to 2 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. However, in the second session, the near-term remained stable, while the far-term saw little activity from both traders and buyers, and many who had profited took their gains, causing market sentiment to weaken again. By the afternoon, market sentiment took a sharp turn downwards. The current month saw short covering due to the approaching settlement date, while the far-term was dampened by the weak wheat market and the poor quality of current wheat, causing selling pressure to increase. Prices fell by 2, 3, and 4 cents for all months. As the settlement date is approaching, actual buyers are expecting a positive result, so the subsequent trend should be stable.

Millers' Buying is Very Sluggish - Wheat Futures Fall Back by About 10 Cents

Yesterday's wheat futures market saw near-term weakness and far-term firmness in the morning. Due to the upcoming settlement date, millers' buying interest was very sluggish, causing market sentiment to be weak. Far-term months saw market sentiment turn firm due to slightly higher overseas wheat prices. However, due to limited buyer interest, although prices initially rose by 3 to 4 cents, they later fell back. By the afternoon, the current month saw significant short covering, and rumors that millers were unwilling to accept the goods prepared for delivery by the bulls caused market sentiment to become even more bearish, causing prices to fall back by 12 cents. The far-term saw increased selling pressure due to the declining flour market, causing prices to fall by nearly 10 cents. The spot wheat market saw the standard price fall again, making it difficult to improve. Jiangbei wheat had fallen to 6.18 yuan, and Tiantai Shaoxing wheat was only 6.1 yuan. Approximately 3,000 bags were opened for sale. It is reported that millers need the price to fall to the 6-yuan level before buying interest can be stronger.

River Rice Market Down Slightly Again

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of more than 40 vessels arrived from various regions, carrying approximately 8,700 to 8,800 piculs of goods. Among them, 25 to 26 vessels carried thin rice. The thin rice market situation remained weak. As both street sales and bulk purchases were sluggish, with Qingdao merchants only buying approximately 2,000 bags, the market price fell slightly again. Thick japonica rice remained stable. Doyang pointed rice also saw little fluctuation. Yin Bian Yuan's supply exceeded demand, causing it to fall by -10 cents.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 31 to 32 vessels arrived from various regions downriver. Demand for various types of goods in the market was weak. White japonica rice was sluggish, with prices falling by a small number of cents to a slight drop. Early rice also showed signs of softening. Arrivals and sales of thin rice were balanced, with prices stable. Sheep pointed rice saw slightly more activity, with prices tightly pegged by a few cents. Du Bu customer pointed and white yuan saw average demand, with market situation stable.

Husked Rice and Polished Rice - Guangdong and Shantou Merchants Still Purchasing

Yesterday, the digestion of husked and polished rice was still good. Although cargo owners and brokers urgently sought to sell, the market was still able to support the prices. Although the demand from Guangdong merchants was not as strong as in previous days, there was still demand for 6,000 to 7,000 piculs of husked and polished rice. Shantou merchants also made some small purchases. Arrivals have been gradually decreasing recently. Some brokers are planning to adopt a passive approach and wait for a rally before resuming inquiries. The market may be able to remain stable. Today, 7,500 bags of Jiangxi rice, 5,000 bags of Hunan rice, 2,500 bags of Han husked rice, 1,050 bags of Wen Yong rice, and 100 bags of large squeezed rice were opened for sale.

### Dried Goods

Shallow River Water Levels Lead to Few Arrivals of Wood Ear Fungus

Selling Price of Sichuan Wood Ear Fungus Rises Again by 8 Yuan - Production Price of He Kou and Xing An Wood Ear Fungus Also Increases

Due to the shallow water levels in the Yangtze River, there have been very few arrivals of wood ear fungus, leading to repeated price increases. Yesterday, Sichuan wood ear fungus shops opened at 138 yuan for Eight-Link, an increase of 8 yuan compared to the previous day. At the same time, a telegram from Hankou reported that the production price of He Kou and Xing An wood ear fungus had also risen to 117 yuan, an increase of nearly 5 yuan. The trend is still tight, with signs of continued increases. The market price of Dingsheng Aviation brand small-package wood ear fungus was quoted at 136 yuan, a slight decrease.

### Piece Goods

Local Factory's Fine Cloth Prices are Surprisingly High

Ample Inventory of Fine Twill is Still Unable to Support Prices - Large Dong Piece White Goods Merchants Prepare to Advance Funds

Yesterday's cotton cloth market was flat. As yarn prices remained strong, prices for spring-season colored goods, poplin, linen, and far-term white goods, coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, and grey cloth were all higher than spot prices. Although current sales to customers are intermittent and very sluggish, this is a normal situation before the end of the settlement. Dong Piece white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill have seen significant consecutive price declines. Most retail merchants have already released their goods. Many large merchants are advocating not to sell and are fully prepared to advance funds at the end of the month, so their intentions are firm. Yesterday, fine cloth and grey cloth were quoted 5 cents higher per piece. Fine twill saw mixed price movements, with only a 5 to 7 cent range. The overall trend was flat. Most transactions were still with local and inland merchants, with approximately 300 bags transacted. Local factory's fine cloth prices were surprisingly high, but fine twill was still unable to support prices. With a large inventory, sales volume exceeded fine cloth by 5 to 6 times, so the market trend continued to be soft, with uneven selling prices. Most of the goods were for local and various customer group dyeing factories and gray cloth factories. Guangdong merchants gradually started to purchase, with a total of more than 400 pieces transacted, mostly for spot and current month goods. The Shandong and Yangtze merchant groups' business in patterned goods and colored goods became quiet. Printed goods, colored cloth, poplin, and woolen cloth markets were firm. Bleached cloth and yarn poplin grey cloth were particularly popular.

### Silk and Tea

Foreign Silk Prices Fall Back - Silk Dealers Mostly Seek to Sell

Yesterday, the overseas silk market turned downward. Silk prices in Japan and the US fell back again. Yokohama spot prices fell by 17 yuan, and futures prices fell by 27 yuan. New York near-term fell by a small 5 points, and far-term fell by 5.5 points. Lyon silk fell by half a franc. The remaining silk products were able to maintain their original prices. The Shanghai silk market also trended weaker. Although many manufacturers remained firm, most dealers sold. Therefore, yesterday, foreign firms had some transactions. American firms' silk prices fell by 10 yuan compared to the previous day. London firms' prices were quite good. For example, the price of 50 tans of Yongyu Jinfeng Tai brand white factory silk was 855 yuan, which was a clear example. User silk with a fineness of 7-8 sold for 820 yuan, which seemed firmer than foreign firms' prices. A total of 153 bales were sold yesterday.

Raw Silk Exports Decrease in the First Half of January

According to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's Silk Division of the Ministry of Industry, raw silk exports from Shanghai in the first half of January saw a significant decrease compared to the second half of the previous month. This period's exports included 968 bales to Europe, 530 bales to the US, 100 bales to India, and 216 bales to other ports, for a total of 1,814 bales. This was a decrease of 1,788 bales compared to the second half of the previous month. It is understood that this was due to fewer goods being released by foreign and silk merchants before the New Year on the 15th. The silk prices during this period were better than before. According to the average prices of various types of silk released by the Bureau for the first half of the month before the 15th, there were significant increases compared to before. The average price of high-grade white factory silk was 930 yuan, A-grade 13.15 was 900 yuan, B-grade was 850 yuan, B-grade 16.22 rough texture was 820 yuan, grey warp was 400 yuan, and zhili was 700 yuan. The details of various types of silk and the destinations are listed below for reference.

### Yarn and Cotton

Low-Grade American Cotton Weaker at Origin

Yesterday's opening of the American cotton market saw slow trading. Most transactions were between fellow traders. Due to good news from Liverpool and favorable conditions in the yarn and cloth market, factories actively bought, with all months rising by 1 to 6 pounds sterling. Foreign merchants sold near-term and bought far-term, while spot merchants did the opposite. However, the price for the March contract still encountered resistance at 12.5 cents. Current sales were better. Low-grade cotton was weaker at origin. The closing was firm. Spot prices fell by 3 pounds sterling, and futures prices fell by 1 pound sterling to rising by 3 pounds sterling.

### Wartime Finance (Continued from Previous Issue)

— Xi Dongshu

(II) Inheritance Tax: This tax is a type of wealth tax, levied once on the inheritance received by the heir. It is most consistent with the principle of fair tax burden and can use progressive tax rates. The United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries have been implementing this tax for a long time. We should implement it as soon as possible to complete the organization of this tax so that it can be fully utilized in the future.

(III) Wartime Profit Tax: During the European War, major countries all levied a type of wartime profit tax. When countless people are sacrificing their lives on the battlefield during wartime, a portion of people are instead reaping extra profits due to the government's massive purchases of materials and the sharp rise in the prices of necessities. The government should seize this type of unexpected gain. The United Kingdom and the United States both collect 80% of wartime profits tax, while France collects 60%. We should also adopt this tax during these extraordinary times.

(IV) Excess Profits Tax: The United States will implement this tax, using industrial and commercial organizations as the unit. For example, an annual interest rate of 8% is first listed as the standard profit. If it exceeds this level, then an excess profits tax is levied. The procedure for collecting this tax is more complicated.

(V) Temporary Property Tax: This tax is a one-time levy from personal property. On a certain date, a heavy tax is levied on the assets of individuals who exceed a certain limit. It is either paid in one lump sum or paid in installments. This is a pure tax on the property itself and is not based on annual income. This tax can limit the formation of small assets and enable the government to collect a large sum within a certain period. Germany has implemented a type of "Imperial Emergency Sacrifice Tax", which belongs to this category. This tax has not yet been widely adopted, but it can be reserved for use in emergencies. In terms of our current economic environment, the direct tax that can be utilized to the greatest extent is income tax, followed by wartime profit tax and inheritance tax.

In addition to increasing these types of direct taxes, the following methods can also be used to enrich the national treasury:

1. Price increases for state-owned enterprises: State-owned enterprises such as telecommunications, postal services, railways, and shipping can increase prices as much as possible, and tax collection is very fast.

2. Special consumption tax and increased entertainment donations: A special tax can be levied on all luxury goods, such as tobacco, alcohol, clocks, watches, motorcycles, and cosmetics. Membership fees and entrance tickets to entertainment venues can also be taxed. The burden of this type of tax falls on people with economic capabilities and does not hinder the lives of ordinary people. Taxes can be levied as much as possible on all consumption that contains luxury.

3. Increase in stamp tax, registration tax, business tax, etc.

4. Exemption tax: A corresponding tax amount can be levied on nationals who are subject to conscription but do not want to participate in the war.

5. Voluntary donations: People can be encouraged to donate during wartime, such as patriotic donations, national salvation donations, national defense donations, aviation donations, and food-saving donations.

6. Foreign debt: It is best to borrow foreign debt during wartime so as not to shake the domestic economy and immediately obtain a large supply of materials. They can then be repaid with materials in the future. This is the most beneficial to wartime finance, especially for our agricultural country. We must obtain the supply of foreign materials. Fearing economic blockade during the war, it is best to borrow more foreign debt before the war breaks out, but this also depends on the international environment.

In short, in addition to being able to utilize foreign debt, we should actively utilize various taxes to cover war expenses and utilize domestic debt as a regulator. Wartime public bonds must still be sold to the public and cannot be used as a reserve for issuing banknotes. Otherwise, as soon as public bonds are issued, banknotes will follow, creating extreme inflation, which will inevitably make our currency follow in the footsteps of the mark and the ruble. However, at the beginning of the war, new tax revenues have not yet flowed into the national treasury, and public bonds have not yet been issued. It is necessary to obtain emergency financing and temporary assistance from the national bank, but it cannot be regarded as a permanent policy to make the national bank provide unlimited supplies. As soon as the war begins, the government should make fundamental plans to increase taxes or borrow from the people.

War is a huge waste of human and material resources. When the fate of the country and the survival of the nation are decided by the victory or defeat of the war, countless compatriots will not hesitate to sacrifice their lives. All nationals with economic capabilities, in addition to maintaining the lowest standard of living, should make economic sacrifices as much as possible. Because if the war is lost, everything cannot be enjoyed. If the war is won, the nation can survive, the country's position can be improved, and the individual's economy can also be improved. Therefore, we should make all kinds of sacrifices in wartime in order to seek the final victory, and we should accept and support the various taxes and domestic debts implemented by the government for the war with the greatest enthusiasm.

Of course, war can be avoided if it can be avoided. In the event that it becomes unavoidable, the big problem is finance. There must be full preparation so that the war is not affected in the slightest. It is necessary to know that the methods of raising funds in extraordinary times are somewhat rigid and are different from peacetime financial management. If there are adequate preparations, it will not be a problem. Suppose that monthly war expenses are 200 million yuan, then the annual expenditure will be 2.4 billion yuan. If one-quarter, or 600 million yuan, comes from new tax revenues, then the remaining three-quarters, or 1.8 billion yuan, will naturally have to rely on public bonds. Our current per capita public debt burden is still less than 13 yuan, which is a very small number compared to the countries of the world. If allocated according to the proportion of the population, these 1.8 billion yuan in public bonds will only increase the burden by 4 yuan per person. Even if this amount of public bonds is issued again in the second year, it will only increase the burden by 8 yuan per person. Now that China is completely unified internally, and the author understands the patriotic thoughts of the general public and the enthusiasm for supporting military leaders, I believe that wartime finance can definitely be carried out smoothly. As for the new tax system and the methods of public bonds, there is no need to explain them in detail now. Today, I will just put forward an outline for you to use as a reference. (End)

### Prospects for the Revival of Jiashan Pottery Industry

— Tu Huizi

Jiashan pottery industry occupies a considerable position in the country, as recorded in local gazetteers. In the northern, northwestern, and northeastern regions of the county, chimneys stand like forests, and there are over eight hundred kiln mounds. Farmers rely entirely on this as their primary occupation. There are more than 460 pottery households, over 110,000 shaping households, over 220 mud-brick households, and over 14,000 others engaged in tasks such as transporting mud-bricks, loading kilns, and transporting goods. This truly affects the livelihoods of the entire county's 210,000 residents. Production includes bricks, tiles, and roofing slates, mostly made by hand. There are only four mechanized factories: Taishan, Huaxin, Taoxin, and Jinmen, with Taishan being the largest, having a branch in Longhua and the most distribution outlets. The main sales market is Shanghai, with the rest distributed throughout the Yangtze River basin, with an annual output of over 110,000 tiles and bricks, valued at 5.89 million. Since the economic downturn affected construction, the pottery industry was no exception. With sluggish sales, finances stagnated, and prices gradually fell. Pottery households reduced expenses by laying off workers and cutting wages, leading to frequent labor strikes. Goods deliveries and transportation came to a standstill, and competitors became jealous of each other, resorting to inferior materials and cutting corners to sell at lower prices. As the quality of goods deteriorated, reputation was lost. Potteries from other provinces seized the opportunity to capture the county's original market, causing the county's pottery industry to decline. When County Magistrate Yu Shuluan visited the county, accompanied by a representative from the Civil Affairs Department's Baojia (self-governance) Guidance Office, he recognized the pottery industry as the county's main production, indirectly related to the province's economy, and intended to revive it. After taking charge of county affairs, he convened pottery merchants from the entire county for detailed discussions and invited pottery experts to the county for on-site inspections to formulate a plan. This was submitted to the provincial authorities and approved at the 856th provincial administrative meeting. The county magistrate then went to Shanghai several times to discuss loans with bankers. With funding secured, a Pottery Industry Management Office was established, with the county magistrate serving as the director. Several engineering consultants were hired, and operations began on November 1st. The county was divided into seven kiln districts, each with an office and a resident manager. The Construction Department also dispatched pottery expert Hu Juewen to the county as a pottery industry instructor, stationed in the county to supervise the work. A Pottery Industry Research Association was also organized, with prominent figures from the party and government serving as committee members. Furthermore, a Pottery Industry Training Course was opened at the county government on December 8th, with all pottery merchants and staff attending. The main points of the revival are as follows: (1) Improving Quality: The county's pottery products are sold to a limited extent inland, with Shanghai being the largest market. In recent years, construction has predominantly used cement, steel, or new-style bricks and tiles. The county's pottery products still adhere to traditional methods and lack improvement, making it difficult to compete in the market. Moreover, the quality of goods varies, and the sizes are inconsistent, failing to meet the needs of engineers. At the same time, large quantities of goods cannot be produced to match the overall materials. Therefore, improvements are urgently needed. The methods include: (2) Technical Improvement: There are specific standards for the mixing and density of raw and cooked mud and the weathering time of new mud, striving to avoid looseness, roughness, or irregular edges in quality. Inspectors are regularly dispatched to the site for verification. The strength of the fire and the amount of water are recorded by supervisors at the kiln, and reward and punishment regulations are established. In addition, methods are devised to improve kiln construction and loading techniques, and demonstration kilns are designated as models for general guidance. (2) Inspection of Products: Brick and tile molds are made by mold merchants and sold to the shaping households. Now, mold merchants are registered and issued permits before being allowed to operate. Molds must have a specific design and be made of durable wood, with engraved trademarks. The management office will verify and stamp them. Shaping households are not allowed to freely modify newly purchased molds. New molds are re-inspected after production, and qualified ones are stamped for sale. All these matters are subject to inspection by inspectors at any time. (2) Controlling Production: All kiln mounds in the county are numbered, and the monthly output is checked. The management office will distribute and promote sales based on the consumption in various ports. The firing and stopping of kilns are also regulated, so that goods are not overstocked and meet the needs of the market. (3) Unified Transportation and Sales: Pottery households have traditionally sold their goods in small quantities and individually, often facing cutthroat competition. Now, each kiln district will organize a cooperative, with pottery households as production and sales members, and shaping households as manufacturing members. There are also basic cooperatives, divided into three types: mud-brick making, sales, and material purchasing. Supervisors are assigned to provide guidance at all times. The seven cooperatives will form a united association, which will handle transportation and sales. Sales offices will be set up in Shanghai and Hangzhou, with sales directors stationed there to report on market conditions and promote production. Secondly, cargo ships will be registered, and the sales system will be changed to a freight system. All kiln prices and freight rates will be set by the office and cannot be changed without authorization. In the future, water transport will be expanded to land transport, not only eliminating the profiteering and monopoly of brokers but also streamlining transaction procedures and eliminating the hassle of solicitation. This is a general overview of the pottery industry revival plan.

### Income Tax Research Association Continued Meeting Yesterday

Discussion of Business Income Completed, Discussion of Salaries and Remuneration Continued. New Voice Agency Reports: The Income Tax Research Association convened by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce held a group meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM and a plenary session at 2:00 PM to continue studying issues related to business income, salaries, and remuneration. Details are as follows:

Group Meeting

The group meeting was held at 10:00 AM. Attendees included Qian Sunqing, Chen Ziyi, Gu Suming, Chen Weiwen, Wang Yonghai, Wang Jian, Xu Yongzuo, and Yan E'sheng. Qian Sunqing chaired the meeting, and the following resolutions were made: (1) Reserve funds should include all reserve funds, such as retained earnings; (2) Reserve funds should be fully included in the calculation of capital, not just one-third; (3) The full progressive system should be changed to a progressive system with excess rates, and the starting point for taxation should be increased, starting from 10%, and the number of brackets should also be increased. The above three items should first be telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance by the various chambers of commerce in a joint name for amendment; (4) The following items listed in Article 12 of the Collection Guidelines should be revised: (A) Capital interest should exclude official interest; (B) Free donations should exclude those for public welfare and charitable purposes (such as donations for purchasing machinery, celebrating birthdays, etc.); (C) The phrase "or reforming equipment" should be deleted from the expenses for business expansion or equipment reform; (D) The phrase "or effectiveness" should be deleted from the repair costs for houses, factories, warehouses, machinery, tools, appliances, and ships that are sufficient to increase their original value or effectiveness. The above decisions should be submitted to the general meeting for approval before implementation.

Research Meeting

The research meeting continued at 2:00 PM, with 162 representatives attending. Gu Suming presided over the meeting, and Ye Zhizhong served as the recorder. The chairman first reported on the results of the group meeting, which were approved and accepted. Subsequently, the following motions were discussed: (1) Wujin Chamber of Commerce proposed that for dividends and profits from January 1 to February 10, 1937, those who settle accounts according to the lunar calendar should be given clear regulations. Resolution: Merged into a related case for request; (2) According to Article 13 of the Collection Guidelines, the income tax already paid from business income should be deducted from the income tax payable. For example, if a certain company paid a tax of 30 yuan on a surplus of over 1,000 yuan in a certain exchange, can this 30 yuan be deducted from the income tax payable after the company settles its accounts? Resolution: According to the interpretation of Article 12 of the Implementation Rules, individual temporary business income can be deducted by exchange brokers, but not by shop numbers; (3) If the company's articles of association do not stipulate dividends, but distribute bonuses from the surplus, will this not be regarded as interest on stocks in the second category of Article 1 of the Provisional Regulations? Resolution: Dividends are taxed, bonuses are not taxed. The Collection Guidelines for the third category have regulations; (4) The Hardware Guild proposed whether income tax should be listed as public expenses. Resolution: Income tax cannot be included in public expenses because taxes can only be calculated after pure profit is determined; (5) In addition to actual losses during the business period, bad debts should include reasonable forecasts of bad debt losses for accounts receivable at the time of settlement. Resolution: Principle approved, submitted to the group meeting for research; (6) The Sauce Garden Industry proposed whether the income from a business's real estate can be tax-exempt. Resolution: Whether a store has real estate income related to its main business or auxiliary business, it must be included in the total income for taxation; (7) The Silk and Satin Industry proposed that if a store has deposits in banks and money shops, and the interest has already been subject to income tax, should it be taxed again after being added to the store's total income? Is this duplication? Resolution: The Collection Guidelines have stipulated that refunds can be issued for those who have been taxed twice; (8) The Great China Match Company proposed whether the amortization of goodwill (purchased with cash) is not clearly stipulated in Article 15 of the Implementation Rules and Article 10 of the Collection Guidelines for the first category, can it be included in the profit and loss statement as an expense? Resolution: Goodwill is the right to operate a business, and Article 13 of the Valuation Method in the Collection Guidelines for the first category already has regulations; (9) If a legal entity whose purpose is not to profit from real estate invests in real estate and obtains income, should that income be excluded when calculating pure profit? Resolution: Submitted to the group meeting for research; (10) Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce proposed that the current accounts of stores are different from fixed deposits because they have both deposits and debts. Should interest income tax be exempted? Resolution: Submitted to the group meeting; (11) Submit a request to the Ministry of Finance to formulate regulations for the organization of the review committee as soon as possible so that it can be established as soon as possible. Resolution: The original proposal was adopted; (12) The Silk and Satin Guild proposed that stores should still retain the cash accounting system. Resolution: Submitted to the group meeting; (13) Chen Ziyi, representative of the bean and rice industry, proposed that the silver and money industry should receive a one-fifth bonus for withholding income tax, and all industries should request the same precedent and handle it uniformly. Resolution: Passed. After the discussion of the above first category of business income was completed, the discussion of the second category of salary and remuneration income continued. First, accountant Xu Yongzuo reported, summarizing the submitted proposals into six points: (1) Salaries starting from 30 yuan are subject to tax, which is too low. It should be changed to starting from 50 yuan; (2) The second category tax rate is too progressive, there are too few brackets, and the difference between each bracket is too large; (3) There are too few tax exemptions. The following should be added: (A) Tax exemption for family burden; (B) Tax exemption for all mandatory savings other than statutory savings; (C) Tax exemption for life insurance; (D) Tax exemption for pensions and alimony in addition to education savings; (4) Fixed allowances for food and lodging expenses, transportation expenses, and entertainment expenses should not be regarded as salary and remuneration and should not be taxed; (5) Commissions, handling fees, and remuneration that are taxed repeatedly should be refunded or not taxed; (6) Copyright royalties should be tax-exempt. After the report, the chairman announced that the second group meeting would be held tomorrow (the 23rd) at 10:00 AM, and the general meeting would be held at 2:00 PM. At 5:00 PM, the Income Tax Affairs Office will host a tea party for all representatives on the seventh floor of the New Asia Hotel. All representatives are requested to attend.

### Two Income Tax Suggestions

Please Extend the Capital Declaration Period; Please Do Not Limit Reserve Funds

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating, "Dear Sir, According to the announcement of your office, all income from items A and B of the first category should be reported and taxed by the persons in charge of the respective businesses after the end of this business year, starting from January of this year. According to the merchants of various industries, the Ministry of Finance's Geng telegram in response to our chamber on January 8 stated, 'We have received the Yan telegram of December. For income from business operations in items A and B whose settlement period is February 10, 1937, the income from January 1 to February 10, 1937, will be allowed to be reported and taxed at the same time after the next settlement. After that, the settlement will be made once a year according to the customary period of each industry.' Therefore, the end of each industry's customary period is recognized by the Ministry of Finance, and the fact that this year's settlement period is February 10 is also known to the Ministry of Finance. The amount of income should be reported after the annual settlement period, which is clearly stated in Article 8 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and in your office's announcement. However, item 3 of the announcement also states that the names of the persons in charge and the actual amount of business capital or share capital should be filled in and sent to the office for registration before the end of January of this year. Before the final conclusion, whether the business will continue, and whether the capital or share capital will increase or decrease, are still uncertain. Therefore, it is practically difficult to fill in the form and report before the end of January. If the business changes, this procedure will be futile and will have to be reported separately. We propose that your office consider making changes and allow the form to be filled in and reported within one month after the final conclusion on February 10, so that the handling will be more based on facts and the business situation will be more convenient. Moreover, since the Ministry has ordered that the tax payment for this year be extended to the next payment, making changes to the period stipulated in Article 46 of the Detailed Rules will not hinder the reporting procedures. We hope that you will investigate and reply. This is the most important thing." Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, He Xianggu, and Kong Rulin, representatives of the bean and rice industry and the miscellaneous grain and oil cake industry, submitted a motion to the Income Tax Research Association of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating the following reasons: "For thousands of years, the commercial customs of our country, regardless of partnerships or sole proprietorships, have always set aside reserve funds from the annual business profits. The reservation of this reserve fund is the same in nature and different in name as the public reserve fund stipulated in the Company Law. The purpose of setting aside is, on the negative side, to prepare for making up for future losses or to meet the needs of special events that occur temporarily, and on the positive side, to enrich the strength of the business so that its business foundation reaches a stable and long-term position. In practice, it participates in business activities with the same function as the original invested funds. Item 2 of Article 7 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations states, 'If there is a public reserve fund, one-third of the total amount may be included in the calculation of capital.' Also, Item 11 of the Draft Collection Guidelines for Income Tax for the First Category of Business Operations states, 'If the public reserve fund has reached one-half of the total capital, the public reserve fund set aside may not be used as a statutory public reserve fund.' This is enough to gradually reduce the strength of business operations and affect the shaking of the entire commercial foundation. To seek profits and avoid losses is human nature. If setting aside a public reserve fund is subject to strict restrictions and limitations in tax law, then those that were set aside in the past will be distributed before the income tax is levied. In the future, even if there are losses that need to be made up, we would rather add capital than set aside reserves to bear the current tax burden. Based on the above reasons, our association believes that at the beginning of the government's creation of income tax, it should give some consideration to the development of commercial self-reliance, quickly allow the public reserve funds of business operations to be included in capital, and cancel the restriction that public reserve funds that have reached one-half of the capital may not be used as statutory public reserve funds. We sincerely hope that this is appropriate. The proposers: Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Industry, Bean and Rice Industry Guild."

### Banks and Money Shops Return Withholding Income Tax Bonuses to Depositors

With the approval of the Ministry of Finance, the Silver and Money Industry Guild has followed through with the bonus policy for withholding income tax. A reporter from New Voice Agency withdrew money from a certain bank yesterday, and according to regulations, the income tax on deposit interest should have been withheld at a rate of 50 per mille. However, the bank actually withheld 40 per mille. According to the bank clerk, the income tax on deposit interest should be 50 per mille according to regulations, but the banks and money shops are now returning the withholding bonus given by the Ministry of Finance to the depositors. This is an extra consideration. The deposit income tax withheld by the bank or money shop is still calculated as 50 per mille.

### Soliciting Opinions on First Category Income Tax

Accountant Pan Xulun and others send a letter to the Income Tax Affairs Office, stating their opinions on revising the Draft Collection Guidelines for First Category Income Tax. "After reviewing the Draft Collection Guidelines for Income Tax, the Income Tax Affairs Office has published them separately to solicit opinions from all sectors. Yesterday, accountants Pan Xulun, Li Wenjie, Qian Naiheng, Li Hongshou, Chen Wenlin, and Tang Wenrui of the Lixin Accounting Firm in this city sent a letter to the Income Tax Affairs Office, stating their opinions on revising the Draft Collection Guidelines for Income Tax for the First Category of Business Operations based on the results of their research. The original letter is very long. The main points are excerpted below for reference and research by those in the industrial and commercial sectors who are concerned about income tax." (1) Article 5 of the Draft Collection Guidelines for the First Category (hereinafter referred to as "the Draft") stipulates that "the public reserve fund mentioned in Item 2 of Article 7 of the Detailed Rules for Implementation is limited to the public reserve fund stipulated by laws and regulations." After reviewing the rules and regulations, the item does not contain the meaning of this restriction, and the Collection Guidelines forcibly restrict it, which deprives the rights that have already been granted to business operators in the Detailed Rules for Implementation. It should be revised. (2) According to the provisions of Articles 9 and 10 of the Draft, the accounting systems of all business operations must adopt the accrual basis (i.e., the accrual basis) and not the cash basis. There may be many obstacles in implementation. In the United States, the accrual basis and the cash basis can be used together. With the immaturity and incompleteness of the level of industrial and commercial accounting in our country, it is difficult to require taxpayers to adopt a complete accrual basis uniformly. It is better to follow the precedent of the United States and allow taxpayers to choose any system. (3) Article 12 of the Draft stipulates that "free donations" cannot be regarded as necessary business expenses. In this case, all gifts, airplane donations, assistance to Sui donations, flood and drought donations, etc., given by various industrial and commercial organizations for entertainment and communication will not be able to be listed as expenses and will have to be taxed, which is too harsh. In fact, these donations are necessary expenditures for industrial and commercial operators to maintain their business reputation. Because they are related to business, they should be regarded as expenses. As for donations that have nothing to do with business, they can be disallowed as expenses. (4) Article 16 of the Draft stipulates, "If the remaining property of business operations in Items A and B of the Draft exceeds the actual amount of original capital after economic calculations due to mergers and dissolutions, the excess portion shall be taxed at the tax rate in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations." In this case, the public reserve fund, reserve fund, and retained earnings that have been set aside shall already be taxed for Items A and B of the first category during previous settlements. When they are liquidated and distributed, they shall be taxed again for Item C of the first category, which is undoubtedly duplication. Article 21 of the Detailed Rules for Implementation stipulates, "If business operations still have income after settlement due to mergers, dissolutions, and liquidations, they shall also be taxed." The income mentioned in this article should refer to the income during the liquidation period and should never refer to the voluntary public reserves that have been set aside and taxed before the liquidation period. Therefore, Article 16 of the Draft must be revised. (5) Article 23 of the Draft stipulates that taxpayers should present "the necessary account books of the current business year or the previous year, or a clear inventory of assets and liabilities, or other documents that can prove it" when being investigated. Observing that the word "or" is used several times in the article, it seems that if the taxpayer has presented any one of the listed documents, he does not need to present other documents again. This seems to be avoiding the opening of the door of convenience for investigators, which is inappropriate. All the words "or" should be changed to "or and" (i.e., "and/or" in English), and the clear inventory that belongs to the nature of profit and loss should also be ordered to be presented sometimes. (6) The asset valuation method attached to the Draft is too simple and rigid and should be supplemented and revised as follows: A. Article 13 of the valuation method stipulates that the amortization period for business rights and copyrights is 10 years, which sometimes cannot be consistent with the facts. It should be changed to a more flexible provision. B. The shortest useful life of each asset stipulated in the depreciation rate calculation table cannot be used as the shortest depreciation period in fact. The occurrence of depreciation is not only due to the durability of the material but also needs to take into account the two levels of "inapplicability" and "abandonment." For example, the table stipulates that the shortest useful life of steel-concrete or brick-built offices and buildings is 60 years. In Shanghai, it is rare for office buildings to be used for as long as 60 years. Therefore, the depreciation rate set by the table must be re-ordered according to the facts with more flexible provisions. C. Article 19 of the valuation method only recognizes the method of estimating bad debts individually and does not recognize the method of comprehensive preparation estimation. This causes significant difficulties for industrial and commercial operators with a large number of accounts in estimating bad debts and is incomplete. VII. There is also an important modification in the wording, that is, Article 7 of the Draft says, "Convert its capital amount in proportion to the entire year during the business period." The wording is really lacking in fluency. It should be changed to "Multiply the pure profit amount by a multiple of the length of time equivalent to the business period for the whole year" before it is fluent. Because the pure profit amount can be converted by the length of time, the capital amount only has a monthly and daily average and cannot be converted into other amounts by the length of time.

### Liang Hejun to Host All Sectors Today

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce convened an income tax research association, which held three meetings and studied problems in two aspects: legal and factual. In addition to the legal points, which were mostly answered by accountant Xu Yongzuo one by one, the factual points that could not be resolved were generally reserved and summarized for the competent income tax authority to review and instruct. Liang Hejun and others from the Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu Income Tax Offices are scheduled to hold a tea party at 5:00 PM today on the seventh floor of the New Asia Hotel to host representatives from the research association, as well as the Party Headquarters, the Chamber of Commerce, the press, accountants, etc., to provide guidance. It is reported that the number of participants is about two hundred and dozens of people, and there will be a grand occasion at that time.

### Yan Huijing Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

Plans to Visit Hangzhou; Returning North in Two Weeks

Former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Dr. Yan Huijing arrived in Shanghai at 7:40 AM yesterday on the Shanghai-Pingjin (Beijing-Tianjin) train from Tianjin and stayed at the International Hotel. According to those around him, Dr. Yan has been resting and recuperating due to stomach illness since resigning and returning to China, and has declined all parties' invitations. This visit is to reciprocate the visits of friends and plans to visit Hangzhou within the month, returning north in about two weeks.

### Female Dancers, Musicians, and Actresses: All Subject to Income Tax Withholding

Central News Agency reports: The Greater Shanghai Entertainment Co., Ltd. previously sent a letter to the Shanghai Income Tax Office for clarification regarding the method of withholding income tax for female dancers, accompanying dancers, musicians, and actresses. A response has been received stating that the income of all the aforementioned professionals is derived from direct labor. Therefore, regardless of whether they are employed by dance halls or are self-employed, and regardless of whether they receive salaries or split earnings by agreement, the organization receiving their income shall withhold income tax from the total amount of their monthly income, based on the salary income of other workers, at the time of distribution or payment. The Shanghai Office has notified all entertainment venues to implement this uniformly.

### The French Concession's Pharmacy Strike Trend Suddenly Eases Last Night

A Solution is Likely. The French Municipal Council Will First Restore Electricity and Fire This Morning. The Pharmaceutical Association Will Then Notify All Businesses to Resume Operations. The Tax Issue Has Been Resolved with Two Methods.

New Voice News Agency reports: The strike of Chinese medicine stores in the French Concession is easing after authorities negotiated with the French Municipal Council and persuaded the pharmaceutical industry. Last night, the situation suddenly became more moderate, with the possibility of an immediate resolution. New Voice News Agency reporters have learned that the French Municipal Council will first restore electricity and fire to all pharmacies today, and then the Pharmaceutical Association will notify all pharmacies to resume operations. Regarding the restoration of electricity and fire, a handling fee of seven yuan should be paid according to regulations, but the French side has also agreed to waive it. Regarding the payment of the pharmaceutical tax, in order to safeguard the budget of the French Municipal Council for the 25th year, it is permitted to pay half of the original amount. As for the 26th year, the French Municipal Council will submit a request to the board of directors for further reconsideration.

Yesterday's Situation Remained Serious. Yesterday, the situation of the Chinese medicine store strike in the French Concession remained serious. According to a New Voice News Agency reporter's investigation, although the detained clerk of Gaodetang has been released, the barbed wire fences in front of Mitianyi, Laotongren, Xiuxin, Rongren, and other stores have not yet been removed. The detectives stationed at each pharmacy have also not been withdrawn. Those whose electricity was cut off yesterday included Xu Chongdao on Avenue Joffre, Kangyutang on Rue Amiral Bayle, and Ye Shudetang on Avenue de l'Amiral Petit Thouars. As of yesterday, almost all had their electricity cut off. The French Municipal Council sent personnel to warn each pharmacy, stating that if the donations were not paid within three days, a complete blockade would be implemented and water would continue to be cut off.

Striking Colleagues Firmly Insist. The Pharmaceutical Association held a plenary meeting of executives and supervisors at 2:00 PM yesterday and decided to convene an emergency meeting of representatives from all colleagues in the French Concession to discuss all response measures. The meeting was held at 9:00 PM that evening. More than 100 representatives from colleagues in the French Concession attended, and all executives and supervisors of the Association also participated. During the meeting, representatives exchanged views and unanimously advocated adhering to the Association's resolution, persevering to the end, and not stopping until the goal of abolishing the exorbitant taxes was achieved.

The Association Decides on Negotiation Channels. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned that in order to alleviate the suffering of colleagues as soon as possible, the Pharmaceutical Association will follow the following channels to resolve the strike. In addition to requesting party and government authorities to continue negotiations, the French Municipal Council's imposition of exorbitant taxes and implementation of power outages were illegal. It was decided to proceed with legal procedures. It is also heard that the Association has sent personnel to consult with lawyers from Da Shang to proceed. In addition, appeals will be made to all sectors of society to help promote an early resolution.

Various Industries Support and Insist on Three Points. Various colleagues in the salted fish industry, aquatic wood industry, and fresh pork industry are deeply indignant because the French Municipal Council not only showed no intention of abolishing the exorbitant taxes but also continued to exert pressure. They intend to submit another request to the authorities to negotiate a resolution as soon as possible, insisting on three requirements: (1) Immediately restore electricity and fire unconditionally; (2) Guarantee the right to demand compensation for losses due to the strike; (3) Guarantee that the same situation will not happen again in the entire district in the future. If the goal is not achieved, they are prepared to take the most effective assistance measures.

The Municipal Government Negotiates with the French Authorities. Central News Agency reports: Yesterday at noon, Cen Zhiliang and Huang Huichang, representatives of the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association, went to the Municipal Government, where Secretary Geng personally received them and inquired about the events of the strike. The two representatives reported the details and requested a speedy resolution to maintain the market. Secretary Geng conducted preliminary verbal negotiations with the French Concession Police yesterday afternoon, believing that cutting off water and electricity would harm public order. Therefore, the Municipal Government intends to restore water and electricity first, and the Chinese pharmacies will also resume business first, and then negotiate the regulations and donations for Chinese medicine preparations. If the French Concession authorities can accept the Municipal Government's views, the situation may ease, it is said.

Such unreasonable actions and oppression are unbearable for businessmen. It is requested that your Federation uphold justice, seek liberation and fight for the dignity of Chinese taxpayers in the entire district, and conduct serious negotiations as soon as possible to abolish the new tax and immediately restore electricity and fire. In the event that this cannot be achieved, all businesses in the district are willing to provide strong assistance and will not hesitate to make any sacrifices, etc. How should this case be handled? It was resolved that: (1) Qu Zhenhua and Gong Jingyan will be elected as representatives to negotiate with Director Wei of the Municipal Council in person. (2) A telegram will be sent to the French Ambassador Nachia to correct the Municipal Council's illegal disconnection of electricity in order to avoid accidents. (3) A letter will be sent to the French Concession Taxpayers' Association to forward to the Chinese directors that the new tax rate for the National Pharmaceutical Industry should be submitted to the Municipal Council meeting for reconsideration and cancellation. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.

Telegraph to the French Ambassador Requesting Correction. The Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation decided to send a telegram to the French Ambassador for correction at a temporary emergency meeting yesterday. The telegram reads as follows: "To His Excellency Ambassador Nachia, The French Municipal Council of the Shanghai French Concession has cut off water and electricity because Chinese pharmacies cannot afford the new tax rate, causing a pharmacy strike. It has been three days and there is still no resolution. Cutting off water and electricity cuts off the lives of citizens, and the Municipal Council often uses this method to deal with citizens. Other shops are also very angry. If the Municipal Council does not restore water and electricity, it will cause resentment among all residents of the French Concession. Considering that Your Excellency has always cared for the citizens of the French Concession, we implore you to correct the Municipal Council's harsh behavior to avoid unexpected changes. Yours sincerely, Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation."

### Various Organizations Sent Telegrams Yesterday

Requesting that Zhang Xueliang be Sent to Court

After listing Zhang Xueliang's eleven major crimes of harming the country and the people, the Joint Conference of Various Organizations in this city submitted them to the Military Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Justice yesterday, requesting that they be dealt with according to the law, and telegraphed the whole country to unanimously advocate for this. The details are recorded separately below.

Submission to the Military Affairs Commission

The Joint Conference of Various Organizations in Shanghai submitted a document to the Military Affairs Commission, stating: "Submission for the sake of submission. Zhang Xueliang, a traitor, has committed notorious crimes against the country and the people. The public groups in this city are heartbroken by Zhang's betrayal and held a joint conference on [Date] to list Zhang Xueliang's eleven major crimes (attached). It was resolved to submit a request to the Military Affairs Commission to transfer Zhang Xueliang to the court for trial. It is noted that Zhang's rebellious mutiny in Xi'an, his acts of insurrection, his collusion with the Communist bandits, and his destruction of unity have previously led to the establishment of a special military court by your esteemed commission, which sentenced him to ten years of imprisonment. Although the National Government issued a special pardon, Zhang's rebellious nature has caused irreparable damage to the country's vitality. If he is not severely punished, how can the law be upheld and the foundation of the country be maintained? It is therefore reasonable to submit a request to your esteemed commission to transfer Zhang Xueliang to the court immediately for trial and to impose the appropriate punishment. We are overwhelmed with sincere prayer."

Submission to the Ministry of Justice

The Joint Conference of Various Organizations in Shanghai submitted a document to the Ministry of Justice, stating: "Submission for the sake of submission. Zhang Xueliang lost four provinces, humiliated the nation, kidnapped the commander-in-chief, and committed acts of insurrection. His crimes are too numerous to count. The public groups in this city are heartbroken by Zhang's betrayal and held a joint conference on [Date] to list Zhang Xueliang's eleven major crimes (attached). It was resolved to submit a request to the Ministry of Justice to order the Supreme Court to promptly investigate. In addition to submitting a request to the Military Affairs Commission to transfer Zhang to the court for trial, it is reasonable to submit a request to your esteemed ministry to instruct the Supreme Court to promptly investigate and punish him according to law in order to uphold the law. We are overwhelmed with sincere prayer."

Telegram to the Whole Country

"To all national agencies, organizations, and newspapers, The Joint Conference of Various Organizations has submitted documents to the Military Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Justice (see above). Please unanimously advocate to punish traitors and uphold the law. We hereby inform you and hope for your consideration. Sincerely, Joint Conference of Various Organizations in Shanghai."

### People's Whereabouts

### Students in Military Training Telegraph Request to Punish Yang

Central News Agency reports: All military training students and trained citizens in this city telegraphed the Central Government yesterday, requesting the suppression of Yang Hucheng, etc., stating: "To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Military Affairs Commission, The Xi'an Incident has aroused nationwide indignation, while the principal offender Zhang Xueliang has received the grace of special pardon, and the accomplices Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong have also received the leniency of being dismissed but retained in their positions. The Central Government's painstaking efforts to preserve national strength and protect soldiers are recognized by the people of the whole country. If Yang, Yu, and others have any conscience, how should they express gratitude and repay their kindness, make amends for their crimes, obey orders, and handle the aftermath? However, news has come that Yang, Yu, and others are prone to creating chaos and show no repentance. They have resisted orders in the past and are now resorting to arms and rebellion. Recently, they have even dared to commit heinous acts, colluding with the Communist bandits, spreading fallacies, and endangering the party and the country. There is nothing worse than this. If such traitors are tolerated again, not only will the unified situation of recent years be on the verge of collapse, but also the great achievements of past bandit suppression will be wasted in a month, and the fate of the country and the nation will be unimaginable. Therefore, we telegraph and request your esteemed departments (government) (commission) to accept public opinion and promptly order suppression in order to quell the source of trouble and restore discipline. Our entire body of 25,000 comrades is willing to serve as a backing and listen to orders. We are overwhelmed with urgent anticipation of your orders. Sincerely, All Military Training Students and Trained Citizens in Shanghai."

### Jardine Matheson Comprador Dispute Resolved Yesterday

The Seamen's Union mediated and decided on three methods.

The Jardine Matheson Company's compradors previously organized a association, arousing opposition from the "xizai" (Chinese clerks) and causing a dispute. Yesterday, Yang, a special representative of the Seamen's Union, sent Wang Jiyi and Wang Yalen to convene Li Zaichen, a representative of the compradors, and Wang Shanqing, a representative of the Tongyi Society, for fair mediation. Three methods were decided, which both parties considered satisfactory, and a resolution has been announced. The methods are recorded below: (1) Regarding the distribution of wine money received, the compradors will receive one share and the trainees will receive half a share. (2) If the compradors are transferred to different ships, the new compradors will receive the original compradors' supplies, food, etc., which will be estimated at market prices. (3) Unemployed workers from both sides must complete registration with the Seamen's Union within one month. Afterwards, the Seamen's Union will assign jobs to the unemployed in order of priority. The Tongyi Society shall not recommend. If the "xizai" are not working diligently, they must be suspended from work, and the compradors must first report to the Seamen's Union for approval.

### Crew of the New Peking Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning

According to reports, the ship is still stranded, but the goods were not damaged.

The New Peking, a ship of the British-owned Taikoo Steam Navigation Company operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, ran aground outside the Zhenhai port at 5:00 AM the day before yesterday. All 500 passengers and more than 2,000 pieces of cargo were rescued. The Shanghai company has hired the Sand No. 4 tugboat of the Wheelock Marden & Co. to the site of the accident for further rescue. At the site of the accident, the British warship Dantai happened to be passing by and berthed nearby to provide protection. The bottom of the ship's forward cabin has been breached by the reef and is still stranded there. If there are no major storms, it should not sink. It is also heard that work has begun to plug the hole, and after the tide rises, they will try to tow it to Shanghai for repairs in the dock. Because the company has no way to send a ship to replace it temporarily, the Shanghai-Ningbo route has been temporarily suspended. More than 200 employees in various departments of the ship, including the firemen, sailors, compradors, cargo clerks, middle cabin, and engine drivers, were rescued to Ningbo by ships such as the Tai'an warship and the anti-smuggling warship. A portion of the crew, 30 people, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning on the Ningshao. A New Voice News Agency reporter spoke with Chu Shengrong, a worker in the middle cabin department who arrived in Shanghai yesterday. He said that the ship left Shanghai for Ningbo on Wednesday (the 20th) and encountered danger at Laotaipo Reef at 4:20 AM on Thursday (the 21st). At 4:30 AM, a telegram was sent to all parties requesting rescue. The head cabin flooded to 11 feet 6 inches, then to 10 inches. The Ningbo company sent the Tai'an warship, the Zhejiang Provincial Foreign Sea Anti-Smuggling Warship No. 25, the Customs patrol boat, and the Jian'an and other tugboats to rescue the passengers to the Liyi, Donghai, Ningxiang, Zhenbei, Ningyu Zhen, and other five ships, and arrived in Ningbo at 2:00 PM. The second and third cabins did not flood, and the goods were not damaged at that time. Wheelock Marden sent two tugboats and a British warship to protect and rescue, etc. Yang Hu, a special representative of the Seamen's Union, sent Secretary Wang Jiyi and Section Chief Wang Yalen, as well as Lu Rongzhi, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch, and Peng Bowei also sent Lu Shuangxi, Mao Yu Feng, and Cheng Yongming, to express their condolences to the workers who came to Shanghai. The Seamen's Union decided to provide relief because the workers were rescuing passengers, and their personal belongings were not taken.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Experiments with Improving Child Laborers' Diets

The Factories Affairs Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council is currently cooperating with the Lester Institute of Medical Research to study the health problems of workers. The results obtained are very beneficial in preventing workers from getting sick. The office noted that many workers get sick due to insufficient nutrition, such as male child laborers often suffering from beriberi, which is especially severe in the summer. The reason is related to food, so it was decided to start improving the diet of child laborers to improve their nutrition. The first step of the experiment is to rent a city house in the factory area to establish a small canteen for child laborers. However, only about 50 people can be accommodated at the beginning of the establishment to simplify the equipment. The canteen will cost approximately 9,000 yuan per year, of which 2,520 yuan will be paid by the factory owners, 3,480 yuan will be donated by the Lester Institute of Medical Research, and the remaining 3,000 yuan will be borne by the Municipal Council. The bureau has approved the inclusion of this amount in the 1937 budget.

### Japanese Consul Suma Discusses the Guangdong Spirit of China

The Japanese Shanghai Daily reports: Consul Suma of Nanjing arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and is scheduled to return to his country on the Taiyo Maru today, the 23rd. He made the following remarks to Japanese reporters at the embassy: "I have been in China for eleven years. During this time, China's situation has changed dramatically, like a surging wave. What I feel most deeply is that the 'Guangdong spirit' is the center of the National Government and has spread throughout China. The characteristics of the Guangdong spirit are an indomitable soul and the recovery of national rights. Many important figures in the National Government are from Guangdong. Although Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei are not from Guangdong, they have also received training in the Guangdong spirit. This spirit has been deeply expanded year by year in the past eleven years, so the indomitable soul will gradually strengthen in the future. The recovery of national rights, that is, the so-called recovery of lost territories by force, cannot be carried out rapidly, but its speed will vary from time to time. This is what we should pay attention to regarding the future trends of China and recognize its true nature. From another perspective, China is a large market in the world. However, this market is now open to foreign countries except Japan. How should Japan develop this market? This is the most important awareness for Japan's policy towards China. I believe that Japan should not take a passive observation of China, but should actively understand and adopt appropriate policies to improve Sino-Japanese relations."

### Abyssinian Film Suddenly Stopped Showing

Shanghai Grand Theater Refunds Tickets, Asks Soviet and American Consuls to Negotiate

The Shanghai Grand Theater at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Qujiang Road, before the screening of the "Abyssinia" film at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, the Italian consulate in Shanghai requested a ban on the screening. The theater ignored this, stating that it had obtained approval from the Central Film Censorship Board and had a license. However, when it continued to screen the film at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Chen Zeliang, the chief of the North Sichuan Road Police Station of the Municipal Police Bureau, suddenly led police officers to the theater to dissuade the screening and ordered the theater, saying, "In order to comply with the order, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau has ordered that the screening of the 'Abyssinia' film be suspended immediately. This is the order, etc. Therefore, it is urgently ordered to obey this order." The theater had no choice but to stop the screening of the film and changed to screening a circus film. Disappointed, the audience members demanded refunds, which the theater immediately complied with. As the theater is run by Soviet merchants, it has reported the matter to the Soviet Consulate in Shanghai to request negotiation. It is also heard that although the film was produced by the Soviet Film News Factory, it is represented by the Asian Film Company, which is run by Americans. Therefore, the agent has also reported to the American Consulate in Shanghai to request negotiation.

### Police and Bandits Chase and Injure Each Other in East Jiaxing Road

Sanxing Leather Shoe Workshop Robbed, Guo Desheng Captures a Bandit and Injures His Hand, Xu Kangkang Wounded in the Abdomen by Stray Bullet

Sanxing Leather Shoe Factory Workshop at No. 35, Lane 166 (Hengfeng Lane), East Jiaxing Road, was opened by Cao Bingsheng from Pudong. The upstairs is where Cao's family resides. At about 5:40 PM yesterday afternoon, suddenly eight bandits went to rob the workshop. Six bandits, carrying pistols, entered the door and first guarded all the partners, apprentices, and women in the workshop. Four bandits went upstairs to search Cao's bedroom, but there was nothing in the room. They only robbed twenty yuan in paper money. The bandits were not satisfied and noticed a gold ring on Cao's wife's hand, so they ordered her to take it off and put it in their pockets and escaped. The apprentices and partners in the workshop noticed the bandits leaving the house and followed them out on tiptoe. The bandits did not notice and continued along East Jiaxing Road towards Fengtian Road. The pursuers saw a guard post there and shouted loudly to catch the robbers. The bandits, hearing the alarm, were greatly panicked and quickly turned into Diswei Road to escape. At this time, the guard post had also arrived and chased and fired shots. The bandits also returned fire to resist arrest. By the time they reached the intersection of Oujia Road, the bandits had successively escaped, leaving only one bandit, hoping to flee towards the Chinese Concession. He was spotted by Guo Desheng, a Hubei native, No. 2440 guard post of the North Sichuan Road Police Station there, and he rushed forward and grabbed the bandit's waist. The bandit, in a panic, pulled out his gun and fired at Guo's left hand. The bullet pierced the back of his hand, grazed his abdomen, and Guo was seriously injured. His strength gradually failed, and he was about to release his hand. Fortunately, the concession guard post had arrived, and the bandit was captured and a pistol was seized. Upon inspection, it was discovered that the bandit's hand had also been shot earlier. The bandit was first taken to the police station and then transferred to the 工部局 (Gōng bù jú) Hospital for diagnosis and treatment before further investigation. Guo Desheng, the injured policeman, was also sent to the hospital by the police station to receive treatment. Fortunately, the injury was not serious and there was no danger. However, during the fierce battle to capture the bandit, Xu Kangkang, a local man, 30 years old, a member of the Fourth Brigade of the Zhabei Security Team, was injured in the abdomen by a stray bullet because he could not escape in time. The injury was very serious and he was also sent to the Tongren Hospital for treatment afterwards. His condition is very critical. The escaped bandits are currently being pursued.

Jiang Futian and Li Xianyang, inspectors of the 法捕房 (Fǎ bǔ fáng) Special Agency, and Zhou Bingcheng, Xie Guangming, Shen Jinshu, Bu Zhenglong, and Tao Ronglin, detectives, received a confidential report at about 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, stating that there was a counterfeit money manufacturing agency that printed a large number of fake 中央 (Zhōngyāng) and other bank notes and used elderly unemployed people to transport and sell them. Today, someone is sending them to Fuxing Lane in East Zilaihuo Street, please send someone to guard and arrest them.

After receiving the report, the detectives disguised themselves and went to Fuxing Lane and the entrance of No. 29 in the alley in East Zilaihuo Street to wait. Before long, they saw two elderly men walking around, looking around suspiciously. The detectives immediately stepped forward to arrest them and found 98 fake one-yuan 中央 (Zhōngyāng) Bank notes and 400 two-jiao Chinese Farmers Bank transfer notes on the two men. All of them were

taken to the police station.

One confessed that his name was Wang Zengjin, 65 years old, from Shaoxing, living at No. 18, Huining Road, 华界 (Huá jiè). He used to run a firewood shop and is now unemployed. These counterfeit notes were taken from Zhao Yixian at Han Yanjing's place and given to me to send to No. 29, Fuxing Lane, stating that I would be given a reward of five yuan. The other confessed that his name was Zhao Yixian, 52 years old, living at No. 8, Xingshun South Lane, Gansi East Road, and also confessed the addresses of many accomplices. The

original group of detectives

continued to go to No. 60, Yuelaifang, Caishi Road, and arrested Han Yanjing (44 years old, from Shaoxing). Han's family has a large scene and is equipped with a telephone to report information. At that time, Liu Yuxuan (31 years old, from Shandong, living at No. 9, Lane 31, Lujia Ferry, Pudong) went to Han's house to collect a membership fee. Han gave Liu a five-jiao 中央 (Zhōngyāng) Bank counterfeit note, so he was also arrested. They then went to No. 30, Chengyu Lane, Lane 221, Lafayide Road, and arrested Yang Fusheng (49 years old, from Ningbo), and brought them all to the police station. They confessed that the

manufacturing agency

was located in the pavilion room at No. 22, Kangyi Lane, Kangdi Road. The boss is Xie Amao, who lives on the front floor, etc. The detectives immediately rushed to the address. Xie Ba fled upon hearing the news. Only Xie's mistress, Xie Xiuzhen (23 years old, from Suzhou), was captured, and two printing oil rollers and a No. 100 patterned printing plate were seized (the patterned plate was found to have been purchased from the

Heiyue Company

of 石田旭山 (Shítián Xùshān) Co., Ltd. on Zhapu Road) and other items were taken back to the police station together. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Second Court. Chen Daqi, the judge, interrogated them. Yuan Jiahuang, the lawyer of the Police Department, requested a two-week extension to investigate the details of the case and then sue for interrogation. Then, the handling detectives reported the process of solving the case. The court verified the report, briefly interrogated the defendants, and decided to reschedule the interrogation to the morning of February 1. The defendants were detained.

### Wang Baolu is Not a Pastor

Further Trial of Caustic Soda Case, Investigation Reveals Debt Dispute

Wang Baolu, an old man from Yangzhou who claimed to be a pastor in the church, 59 years old, living at No. 7, Sida Lane, Shigao Tower Road, took a bottle of caustic soda on the afternoon of the 12th of this month at 7:40 PM to No. 26, Shoupin Lane, Huade Road, and poured it on the face of Qin Gengtao, a young clergyman from Chuansha, Pudong (26 years old). Qin also resisted at the time, causing Wang's forehead to be injured. Wang

saw the disaster he had caused, and fled back home. Later, Shan Huihai, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road Police Station, rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm and investigated the incident. He immediately sent the defendant Qin Gengtao to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. Wang's address was located on a road built beyond the boundary and belonged to the 华界 (Huá jiè). The police officers of the competent police station cooperated to arrest Wang and take him to the police station. His forehead was also

injured by caustic soda. He was sent to the patrol hospital for treatment. The next morning, the police station sent the case transfer form along with an empty bottle to the First Special District Court to prosecute Wang Baolu for injury under Article 278, Section 3 of the Criminal Law. Because both parties were in the hospital and could not testify in court, the reason for the incident was unknown. An extension was requested to allow Qin and Zhu to be interrogated after they recovered from their injuries. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing

visited the Third Criminal Court to investigate the case. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the 工部局 (Gōng bù jú), stated that the victim Qin Gengtao had arrived at the case and his injuries had slightly healed. It was found during the rescheduling that the defendant Wang Baolu was not a pastor. Jiang Changchuan, the chairman of the Shanghai Christian Preaching Federation, sent a letter to the police station stating, "After investigation, there is no Wang Baolu among the pastors in Shanghai. The churches cannot tolerate a pastor who is so unaware of offending others. However, Wang is probably just some

German servant, or he has recently suffered from mental illness. This is related to the reputation of the church, etc." The letter was presented for inspection. It was also found that the defendant had purchased a bottle of the caustic soda used in the incident from a pharmacy on Baoxing Road, Zhabei before the incident. His purpose at the time was to go to Qin Gengtao's house and blind his eyes with the caustic soda to vent his anger. Shan, the detective, and the Zhabei police officers

arrested the defendant and he readily admitted to his intentions, etc. The defendant confessed that he had known Qin Gengtao for more than seven years. At that time, he met him preaching at the entrance of the Baitu Bridge Gospel Church and introduced him to work as a staff member at the Sacred Book Society at No. 58, Hong Kong Road. Later, when his salary was not enough to cover his expenses, he often borrowed money from me to help him. He often came to my house for meals. Recently, on January 1 of this year, I entrusted a friend surnamed Cai

to arrange a marriage for him. I advanced him one hundred yuan before the marriage, and I was the guarantor. However, after he married his wife, he never came to my house again and broke off relations with me, saying that we should not have any contact. It was also heard from his mother-in-law that he now wanted to convert to Buddhism. That day, I went to his house to persuade him without success, and he poured caustic soda on me. I snatched it away and injured his face. The rest of his confession was evasive. The victim Qin Gengtao stated that he

worked at the Sacred Book Society on Hong Kong Road. He is a preacher at the society. We have known each other for many years. The hundred yuan he borrowed when I got married was guaranteed by him and has not been repaid. I have always been on good terms with him. People in our church respect Christ and aim to love and save people. The defendant should not have committed such a malicious act, etc. Judge Zhong ruled that Wang Baolu be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing to call witnesses for further investigation.

### Bus Overturns in Shanghai-Taizhou, Causing Disaster

Twelve Passengers Injured, Cause Due to Driver's Carelessness

A long-distance bus No. 17 of the Shanghai-Taizhou Bus Company, which departed from Jiading for Shanghai at 11:10 AM yesterday, overturned on the side of the road near Shixianggong Temple due to the driver's carelessness. Twelve passengers in the bus were injured, four of whom were seriously injured, with head injuries, skull damage, and life-threatening conditions. They were subsequently sent to various hospitals in Shanghai, Jiading, Liuhe, and Taijiabao for treatment. The cause of the accident was that the top of the bus was overloaded with goods, and the driver was not a formal driver, but a copper worker who repaired cars, resulting in the accident.

### Part of Li Guojie Case to be Executed First

50,000 Yuan of Stocks Pledged to Bank, Part of Maolu Farm Still Under Investigation

Li Guojie, the former general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, embezzled 700,000 taels of public funds. The local court is now executing the case, with a total of more than 1.2 million yuan in principal and interest. He has been summoned and pursued many times, but has not paid a penny. Because he escorted the remains of former Executive Duan to Beiping, the deadline was yesterday. Judge Wang Fengqiu of the execution court held a hearing in the Eighth Court for execution. Li Guojie did not arrive. Lv Shifang and Jiang Yiping, two lawyers, appeared in court as agents, stating that Li had returned to Shanghai, but was unable to attend court due to illness. The stocks investigated by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company did exist, but they had been pledged to the Siming Bank in 1933. A total of 30,000 yuan of stocks had been pledged and could be handed over for execution. In addition to these stocks, there was no property that could be seized. They requested that the court issue an execution license in accordance with Article 7 of the Execution Law. If Li could work in society in the future, he would slowly find a way to repay the debt (just like the 民間興隆票 (Mínjiān xīnglóng piào)), which would benefit both parties. They asked the plaintiff to forgive him, etc. Jiang Hechun, the agent lawyer of the plaintiff, stated that according to the defendant's lawyer, the stocks had been pledged to the Siming Bank. He requested that the execution be carried out first. According to a report, it was found that Li had a Maolu Farm in Jintan County, which proved that Li was not without property. It was difficult to agree with the provision in Article 7 that the debtor had no property that could be executed. At this point, lawyer Lv Shifang again stated that the Maolu Farm was run by Qian Renzu, with Ji Zhenggang as the manager. Because the management was poor, he had requested to take over the farm. Li could not develop the farm because there was no investment, so he did not take it over, which led to the outside world knowing that Li had run the farm. In fact, he had not taken it over and could be investigated. The stocks were worth 50,000 yuan, with 30,000 yuan pledged to the Siming Bank. There was also a commemorative watch worth 5,000 yuan, pledged to Zhou Shuwen, with approximately 3,000 yuan pledged. At this point, lawyer Jiang again stated that he did not oppose what the defendant's lawyer said, but he could not agree either. He could not express any opinion at this time and would report to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which would then report to the Ministry of Communications for further review. At this point, the court ruled that the first part, the stocks of the Siming Bank, should be handed over for execution first. The second part, the Maolu Farm in Jintan, should be investigated by both parties. The court would issue an official letter to the Jintan County government to be responsible for the investigation. After the reply was received, a hearing would be scheduled again.

### Wife Dies and Loses Job, Xiong Ping Commits Suicide

Extremely Miserable Situation

Xiong Li, a young woman from Yunnan, 23 years old, graduated from the Tongde Obstetrics Hospital. She recently set up her own hospital at No. 1013, Huade Road, Hongkou. On January 18, for some unknown reason, she secretly took sleeping pills and committed suicide. Her family discovered her and sent her to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment, but she died on January 21. Her husband, Xiong Ping, 26 years old, also from Yunnan, used to work in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is currently the editor-in-chief of a bookstore. Recently, the bookstore declared bankruptcy due to the sluggish market. Xiong Ping was deeply traumatized by his wife's tragic death and the recent business failure. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, he suddenly had a suicidal thought and stabbed himself in the throat with a sharp knife. He was injured and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. He was sent to the Tongren Hospital for treatment by his family. It is said that the injury was very serious.

### Illegal Gambling Den on the Waters of Xuejia浜

Twenty-Five Gamblers Caught on the Jinbaotai Coal Ship

Yesterday morning around two o'clock, Wei, the Chief of the Municipal Police Water Patrol Team, dispatched officers Zhang Guanyun and others to patrol the Huangpu River. When they reached the waters off Xuejia浜, they suddenly heard a cacophony of voices from the Jinbaotai coal ship. Upon investigation, they discovered a group of people gambling inside. They immediately reported back to the Chief, who ordered Inspector Pan Xiutong to lead a large contingent of police to the scene. The gamblers, engrossed in their games, were caught completely off guard by the police raid. Twenty-five gamblers, including Jin Lianghai and Ruan Gengquan, were apprehended on the spot, along with gambling paraphernalia and confiscated gambling money. The entire group was taken back to the station for interrogation. Given the late-night nature of the gambling and the gathering of a crowd, orders were issued yesterday afternoon to prepare a formal report, including witness statements, to be sent to the General Bureau for further investigation.

### National YMCA Mourns Yu Rizhang Yesterday

The National Association of Chinese Christian Youth held a memorial service yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to commemorate Yu Rizhang, the former General Secretary of the Association. Attendees included Association staff, Yu's family, and Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, who also sent a wreath. Pastor Yu Ensi presided over the service, with Bishop Wu Shide delivering a speech and Fu Ruoyu offering condolences.

### Paramount Employees Sue Directors After Bankruptcy

Claims are for Unpaid Wages and Breach of Contract; Court Will Summon Witnesses for Further Investigation

The Paramount Grand Hotel, established by Dacheng Co., Ltd., which also operated a dance business, went bankrupt on August 5th of last year, owing more than 300,000 yuan. After being sued by various creditors, the company also filed for bankruptcy with the First Special District Court, where the matter is still being processed. Now, sixteen of its creditors, including foreign employees like Omore, allege that the company's bankruptcy was a fraudulent act. Through their lawyers, they have filed a criminal self-indictment against Zhang Qinbo, Chairman of Dacheng, Zhu Ruhong, Director and General Manager of Paramount, and Directors Zheng Xitao and Gu Liancheng with the First Special Court, requesting that they be investigated in accordance with Articles 152 and 154 of the Bankruptcy Law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Fu Lin opened the court to hear the case. Only Zheng, Gu, and Jin, three of the defendants, appeared; the others were absent. The plaintiffs' lawyers presented their arguments, stating that the amounts owed to the plaintiffs were either for unpaid wages or for breach of contract, and that separate civil suits had already been filed. However, the company has failed to fully submit its accounting books, and the minutes of the board meetings have been concealed. The defendants, as those responsible for the company, cannot evade responsibility. Furthermore, it was argued that by the end of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), Dacheng's capital had already been almost entirely depleted, yet the defendants failed to declare bankruptcy as required by law and continued to operate, causing losses to third parties. This conduct clearly violated the provisions of Articles 152 and 154 of the Bankruptcy Law. The plaintiffs requested that the civil lawsuit files be reviewed and that the bankruptcy administrator be examined to clarify the matter. As for the defendants who failed to appear, they requested that arrest warrants be issued. In court, Zheng Xitao testified that he and the other defendants were directors of Dacheng, with Zhang as chairman and Zhu concurrently serving as general manager. However, Jin had resigned. Board meetings were held in the general manager's office, and there were meeting minutes. These records may have been lost when the company's assets were auctioned off. All other records have been handed over, and there has been no concealment. Judge Fu stated that the case still required further investigation and ordered a continuation of the hearing on the afternoon of the 29th of this month.

### Pawned Everything, Attempted Suicide but Failed: Driven to Crime by Circumstances

Chen Kaiyuan Frauds Post Office Deposits Due to Desperation; Law is Not Devoid of Human Sentiment, Sentence Suspended

Chen Kaiyuan, a Cantonese man, is 25 years old, graduated from Peking University, married a woman named Wang, and has a two-year-old child. Chen recently brought his wife and children to Shanghai to make a living, residing in room number six of the Zhongshe Dormitory at 656 Weihaiwei Road. Being unfamiliar with the place and without relatives, he has been unable to find work for several months, while daily necessities cannot be dispensed with. As a result, all valuables have been

pawned to exhaustion. The Zhongshe dormitory fees are owed for as long as four months, but because Chen is normally amiable and of upright character, the Zhongshe supervisor not only did not pursue the matter but even lent him more than seventy yuan. Now Chen's wife is six months pregnant and about to give birth, requiring money for medical expenses, placing Chen in a situation no different from a living hell. He repeatedly considered suicide, but because of his love for his wife and child, he could not bear to do so. Therefore, after racking his brains, he decided to

take a risk. On the morning of the 18th, he managed to borrow ten yuan and, using the name of Lü Yanshen, deposited it at the Seymour Road Post Office. That same afternoon, he withdrew nine yuan from the Fujian Road Post Office, leaving a balance of one yuan. Then, Chen had three stamps made at the Mingzhi Engraving Shop at 1319 North Sichuan Road, by Wu Zikun, an apprentice from Changzhou, replicating the post office stamp and the two staff stamps on the deposit book. He then filled in a deposit of

two hundred yuan on the deposit book for the 19th and, at 9:30 AM yesterday morning, again went to the Fujian Road Post Office to attempt to withdraw fifty yuan. However, the post office detected the fraud and reported it to the Laozao Police Station. Chinese Detective Zhang Yuanjing and Detective Xue Youwen arrested Chen. Subsequently, Wu Zikun, who made the stamps, was also apprehended. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court, Criminal Division. Police Barrister Ru Baoyi explained the case and charged Chen with

attempted fraud and forgery of seals under Article 339, paragraph 3, and Article 218 of the Criminal Law. Chen Kaiyuan was defended by Barrister Le Junwei. When questioned, Chen Kaiyuan confessed that he had resorted to this desperate measure due to the pressure of life. Wu Zikun stated that when he made the stamps, he did not know that they were forgeries. Then, Police Barrister Ru stated that the facts of the defendant Chen Kaiyuan's crime were very clear, but he was a highly educated man who had

been forced by circumstances to take a risk, leading him to break the law. Furthermore, he had no prior criminal record. He asked the court to consider this point when sentencing and grant him a suspended sentence so that he could reform. Barrister Le, defending the defendant, said that he had learned about the matter yesterday while at Zhongshe and, seeing the defendant's pitiful situation, knew that it was not intentional. Therefore, he was providing his services free of charge today. He asked the court to

show leniency and impose a lenient sentence. Chen Kaiyuan and his wife and children, who were in the audience, were all weeping silently, a truly tragic scene. Chief Judge Feng Shide reviewed the case and announced the verdict: Chen Kaiyuan was sentenced to six months imprisonment for attempted fraud, suspended for two years. Wu Zikun was acquitted, and the forged stamps were confiscated.

### Shanghai Postal Workers' Union Elects New Executive and Supervisory Committees Yesterday

The term of the 13th Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union expired in September of last year. Elections should have been held immediately, but they were repeatedly postponed due to the election of representatives to the National Assembly and the Xi'an Incident involving Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Finally, the 14th First Representative Assembly was held at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon in the hall on the third floor of the Shanghai Postal Administration, and the 14th Executive and Supervisory Committees were elected at the same time. A total of 117 representatives attended, and Cui Buwu, representing the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Zhu Xuefan, representing the National Postal Workers' Union, attended and gave speeches. After formal greetings, the chairman first reported on the purpose of the meeting, followed by reports on the important union affairs of the past year by the 13th Executive and Supervisory Committees. Then, Cui Buwu, representing the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, stating that he was very honored to participate in the meeting and had always admired the union. After hearing the chairman's and other comrades' reports on union affairs, he was even more convinced that the union's work had been outstanding. People across the country know that the Postal Workers' Union is the most well-organized and excellent union. This is the result of the union comrades' hard work and efforts. He was confident that the union would continue to maintain its past glory and carry it forward. Next, Comrade Zhu Xuefan of the National Postal Workers' Union delivered a speech, stating that the purpose of the representative assembly was to elect new executive and supervisory committees. What everyone should pay attention to, of course, are the words "elect new," but it must be known that electing new is only a formality. What we should pay more attention to is the spirit. Merely having a form without a spirit will never be able to relieve our pain or fulfill our original intentions. The success of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union is not based on its long history, but on the spiritual unity of all postal workers. If we want to preserve and promote past glory, we must value the word spirit. In the future, we should still follow the three major goals of serving the country, serving the organization, and serving the members, and continue to work hard. Finally, Comrade Zhu put forward the following three points: ① Promote thrift, ② Promote postal worker welfare, ③ All member disputes should be resolved by the union. He sincerely hoped that all representatives and the next committee would heed these three points. The speech was lengthy, so we will omit the rest. Finally, the election was held. The election results are recorded below: (A) Formal Executive Committee: 1. Xiao Qingshan, 2. Fan Caicong, 3. Lu Keming, 4. Cheng Zuoqing, 5. Zhang Zuoqi, 6. Wang Kai, 7. Wu Yaxiong, 8.

### Cook Murder Case

Struck in the Abdomen with a Fist, Chef Dies Tragically

Gan Zhongyi, a chef from Songjiang who worked at the Yushuntai restaurant at 5 Cichang Lane, Sichuan Road, was 52 years old. The day before yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, he had a work-related dispute with his colleague Zhang Xiaomao (a 26-year-old from Ningbo). Zhang struck Gan's abdomen severely. Afterwards, the restaurant owner, Li Longchang, took Gan to Renji Hospital, but treatment was ineffective, and he died at 6:45 PM that evening. The hospital reported the death to the General Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. Zhang was arrested and detained at the police station, and Gan's body was transported to the Fielun Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, Judge Tang of the First Special District Court, accompanied by two medical examiners, Wei and Zhang, and a clerk, arrived at the morgue. After examining the body, they took their seats in court. According to Zhang Xiaomao's statement, at 8:30 AM the day before yesterday, Gan was peeling shrimp in the restaurant, and he was cutting tofu. Gan suddenly told him to cut potatoes, but he refused because the wok was not empty. Gan then used foul language, and he struck him once. Li Longchang and Xu Xiaodi testified to the situation at the time. Judge Tang then ruled that the deceased, Gan Zhongyi, was a male who had died from being struck in the abdomen by Zhang Xiaomao while alive. The body was handed over to his nephew, Gan Futao, who signed a receipt for the corpse.

### Female Police Officers in the City Begin Outside Patrols

Uniforms Identical to Male Officers

According to the Guomin News Agency, female police officers in the city began their duties nearly a month ago and have had very good results, which have been praised by their superiors. However, they were previously only working in internal affairs, and were not seen much on the streets. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter passed by the West Gate and saw a group of female police officers, led by a police officer, patrolling the area along the West Gate Wenmiao Road, Zhonghua Road, Zhaojiabang Road, and Jingxiu Road. They were cracking down on street vendors and illegal stalls to avoid obstructing traffic, and patiently persuading people, which attracted the attention of passersby. Their uniforms are identical to those of male police officers, except that they are slightly shorter and have the words "female police" on their shoulder badges.

### Three Rice Industry Associations Issue Notice to Stop Illegal Deductions

The Shanghai Rice Grain Merchants' Trade Union, the Shanghai Northern Jiangsu Rice Transporters' United Association, and the Shanghai Changshu Guild jointly announced: Notice is hereby given: According to reports from the members of our associations, the Jiangsu, Nanjing, Shanghai, and County Rice Industry Associations Federation illegally entrusts the Bean and Rice Industry Trade Union to deduct a fee of one cent per stone (unit of measurement) as membership dues, which has caused unanimous opposition from rice merchants. The membership dues of that federation should legally be borne by the members who have joined that federation. To deduct dues from rice merchants is a violation of current laws and regulations. After appealing to the Party and government agencies to stop this practice, we received instructions from the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Zhizi No. 4822, stating, "Regarding the request to stop the Jiangsu, Nanjing, Shanghai, and County Rice Industry Associations Federation from illegally deducting membership dues," "Noted. We have already issued orders to the said federation and the Bean and Rice Industry Trade Union to stop this practice and have also sent a letter to the Bureau of Social Affairs to investigate." In accordance with these instructions, we have recorded and promulgated the case. We hope that all rice merchants will be informed. This notice is hereby given.

### YMCA Comforts Wounded Soldiers in Suiyuan

Since the establishment of the YMCA National Association's War Zone Servicemen's Center in Suiyuan, various programs have been launched. Yesterday, the Association received a letter from Suiyuan reporting that a Comfort and Entertainment Gala for Wounded Soldiers had been held on the 17th, lasting three days at the Public Assembly Hall. The wounded soldiers were transported by car, and over 7,000 soldiers and civilians attended over the three days, creating much excitement. Although Suiyuan already has one silent film projector, they hope to watch a sound film. Therefore, they hope to raise funds in Shanghai to purchase a sound film projector and transport it to Suiyuan. Due to budgetary constraints, the Association has decided to raise funds from all sectors. Furthermore, the wounded soldiers in Suiyuan are in urgent need of towels and daily necessities. Upon receiving the report, the Association has separately requested donations from large companies in this city such as Wing On, Sincere, New New, and Amoy. It is expected that those who love the country and do not want to fall behind will generously donate. The Suiyuan Service Center urgently needs these supplies to be transported so that they can be distributed to the wounded soldiers. The Servicemen's Center has recently sent people to start new operations in Datong Pingdiquan and has already begun work.

### Capital Express Refund Policy and Cabin Occupancy Regulations

The Beijing-Shanghai Railway's Capital Express operates on the principle that each passenger receives a seat. After this policy was implemented, all passengers who purchase tickets must have a seat reserved for them. However, if a passenger requests a refund or changes to another train after the train has departed, the seat reserved by the railway will inevitably be wasted. Therefore, it is proposed that passengers with tickets for the Capital Express who need a refund or change to another train must contact the ticket office half an hour before the train departs. Otherwise, the ticket will be considered invalid. In addition, the Capital Express has three cabins. If four passengers, they can reserve one cabin. If there are fewer than four people but they want to occupy a cabin, they will be required to purchase tickets for the actual number of people plus pay half price for the unoccupied seats. After this bureau submitted the above two methods to the Ministry of Railways for review, it received Order No. 405 from the Industry Department, stating that the proposed Capital Express refund method has been approved and placed on file. Regarding the cabin occupancy regulations, it is instructed to comply with the provisions of Article 31, Paragraph 1 of the seventh edition of the Passenger Car Transportation Regulations, which requires the purchase of four full tickets to reserve one cabin.

### Chinese Female Pianist Xia Guoqiong Will Perform Tomorrow

The Municipal Council Music Band will hold a concert tomorrow (the 24th) afternoon at the Lyceum Theater on Pu Shi Road. Chinese female pianist Xia Guoqiong has been invited to be the main performer of "Hungarian Fantasia," accompanied by the entire band. This is the first time the band has collaborated with a Chinese artist. Ms. Xia is a top student of the famous Russian piano professor Zakharov in this city. She has studied piano with Zakharov for nine years and is not only skilled but also highly praised by Zakharov. Last year, she traveled to Japan, where music authorities such as Omaki Masao and Yamane Ginji also expressed their admiration and invited Ms. Xia to return to Japan this spring to hold a solo concert. This shows the high praise from international figures. The piece that Ms. Xia will perform tomorrow is a work by the 19th-century Hungarian Romantic composer Liszt. The performance of this piece will last for thirty minutes. The work is beautiful in content, powerful in expression, and magnificent in spirit. It requires profound cultivation to perform successfully. Ms. Xia has already practiced with the Municipal Council Band once, and the entire band praised her unanimously. They also hosted a banquet after the practice to celebrate her success, showing how wonderful her performance is.

### Zhu Xiaoheshang Gets a Large River Pig

Completely Black, No Scales, No Hair; Weighs Over Ten Loads

Zhu Xiaoheshang of Chongming saw an object on the beach a few days ago, completely black and as big as an ox. At first, he thought it was a dead fish. After carefully observing its shape, he realized it was not dead. The creature, because of its huge size, had mistakenly entered the shallows and lost its ability to move automatically, making it unable to withdraw from the beach. He immediately summoned the villagers to carry it onto a boat and transport it to the city center to try to sell it. Because no one inquired about it, it was transported to the Yunzao浜 in Wusong to be docked. For a time, crowds of people gathered. Those who were curious hired ferry sampans to go to the boat to watch it, as a result the many dozens of sampans were too few to keep up with the demand. The sampan boatmen took the opportunity to make a lot of unexpected business. It is said that this object is called a river pig, and its size is very different from those seen in the Huangpu Port. Because it is produced in salt water, it is so big, weighing about ten loads. It is completely black, without scales or hair, its head is like a pig, but its nose is longer. Although there were many viewers, there were also no buyers. Afterwards, Zhu Xiaoheshang still took it back to Chongming, intending to boil it for oil and sell it.

### Accusation of Obscene Conduct Against Zhang Sheng

Zhang Shengzhi, a 45-year-old man from Jiangxi residing at No. 52 Baoxing Li, Dongxinqiao Street in the French Concession, runs a cotton business in Shanghai. Zhang, misled by rumors and the art of "collecting yin to supplement yang," employs young maids, always selecting young women, to carry out his inhumane and selfish practices. To date, he has employed and replaced nearly twenty women. Approximately two days ago, he hired Zhang Cuizhen (21 years old), a woman from Suzhou, through a broker to work at his residence. Finding her appearance pleasing, Zhang attempted to act indecently. When she refused and wanted to quit, Zhang forcibly withheld her gold ring as blackmail. The woman reported this to the French police station the day before. Detective Wang Zhihao investigated and discovered the concealed details. Zhang was arrested and brought before the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday. The legal counsel for the police requested an extension for investigation. Judge Chen Daqi questioned both the plaintiff and the defendant. The defendant requested a lawyer for defense and asked to be released on bail. The court ordered a rescheduled hearing on the 26th.

### Letter to the Editor

To the esteemed editors: The report on the case of Lu Xingrong suing Lu Youchen for alimony, published in your newspaper on the 17th, does not match the facts. This case was initiated by Lu Xingrong's relative, Wang Liangyu, who accompanied Lu Xingrong to this lawyer's office on August 18, 25th year [of the Republic], where she personally signed the engagement contract and power of attorney. Later, due to the application for litigation assistance, Lu Xingrong personally handed over many pawn tickets, which this lawyer submitted on her behalf. These pawn tickets all belonged to the woman herself, as she stated and retrieved them in court. Her relative did not entrust the engagement. There are records of the engagement contract and power of attorney to prove this. Accordingly, we request your newspaper to make a correction. Sincerely, Lawyer Xu Jiashi, January 21.

Women's Special

### How to Raise Your Children

— Luo Zheng

Some say: Children are the foundation of the nation, and the nation is the basis of the country. If we want to talk about saving the country, we should naturally first strengthen the foundation of the country. To strengthen the foundation of the country, we need to cultivate the foundation of the nation. Therefore, our research on children's issues is the only urgent task at hand. Now, whether it is from the perspective of education, health, or even thought and movement, we should guide them forward on the path of the times.

Raising children is not an easy task. It is more important than undertaking any work because in early childhood, we only need to pay attention, and then we can discover how every normal child should spend the years before entering school. During this period, all kinds of healthy habits and all the physical and mental characteristics necessary for being a person in the future must be formed and perfected. Until entering school, all their habits and characteristics must undergo a degree of transformation and training. Because children are just a kind of larvae in humans, in terms of health, what they need is proper sleep, proper food, and a considerable amount and kind of play. At the same time, a certain amount of time should be set aside to carry out physical examinations to prepare for preventing the occurrence of diseases.

Every child is rich in creativity and imitative ability, but also rich in destructiveness—no matter what paper or object they get, they will make it into a shapeless thing, and they will also imitate others' every move, but at the same time, they will also destroy a good thing. Especially they are good at liking the new and disliking the old. No matter food or toys, when they first get them, they are always happy, but after playing with them for a while, they will hate and abandon them. Their desire for knowledge is also very strong, which can be seen anytime and anywhere. Whenever they see something or get something, they always like to get to the bottom of it with adults; so, at this time, as long as adults enlighten them with correct knowledge, they will definitely understand it easily. Therefore, general parents should adopt the following attitudes towards their children: ① Maintain a calm attitude. If young children are disobedient, if you yourself become excessively tense and excited as a result, it will cause children who like stimulation to often be disobedient. ② Give children their own playgrounds and toys. If children spend too much time with adults, their creative and spontaneous nature will be limited by imitation. ③ When children see something interesting and reach out to take it, do not stop them or take the object away. Because at this time their independence is destroyed, and the child feels that they must rely on adults. ④ Make the child's daily life disciplined and let him follow a daily routine, not allowing him to overstep it; because adhering to routines is the shortcut to success in future life.

Now, I have tentatively made a daily routine schedule for general school-age children below.——Some points in this article have been referenced from "Child Rearing Maxims" written by Ms. Ahme Hostlo, Professor of Nursing at Western Reserve University in the United States, translated by Wen Zhenjun.

Get up at 7:00 AM every morning, wash your face and brush your teeth yourself, the less help from others the better, after washing up, have breakfast immediately. At 8:30 AM, take a spoonful of cod liver oil, then go outdoors to play. At 10:00 AM, drink a small cup of orange juice. At 11:00 AM, take a bath and prepare lunch. Rest for twenty minutes before lunch. Lunch should be eaten by oneself and not fed by others. Around 1:00 PM in the afternoon is nap time. At 3:00 PM, drink a cup of milk and go out to play again. At 5:30 PM, have dinner, after dinner, stay indoors for small games until bedtime. Go to bed at 7:00 PM. Every day, you should go to the suburbs or parks to absorb fresh air.——

But unfortunately, such a simple and complete life table cannot be enjoyed by general Chinese children: if there is such a nanny or parent in China, then only the sons and daughters of a small number of bourgeoisie can implement it. But I hope that every Chinese child will have this right; so I would like to present this "Children's Life Procedure" to every child in the new China.

Children's issues have always been highly valued in European, American, and Japanese countries. Even Hitler, who advocated dictatorship, once promoted eugenics, and the world's old man Mussolini also rewarded childbirth last year. Japan's efforts in children's education are even more vigorous. Even our ancient country paid attention to early childhood education, "Once, Mencius' mother chose to live near a cemetery," is one example, but in some periods before, such a serious fundamental problem was ignored by the people of the country. But in this extraordinary period, please, women, transform the environment of these future masters!

### The Homespun Cloth Skirt and Jacket of Hunan Female Students

— De Lin

Women's vanity is greater than that of men. They are always fantasizing: "Clothes must be brocade," "Residences must be magnificent": otherwise, it is not enough to show their extravagance and wealth. In recent years, due to the sluggishness of my country's industry and commerce, the influx of foreign goods, and the alarming trade deficit, some people believe that women are the most powerful members in promoting foreign goods; if you don't believe it, just look at their daily essential cosmetics, perfumes, and clothing made of cotton and wool fabrics, most of which are imported goods, but their deeply rooted vanity is also an undeniable fact, which they see as more important than anything else. However, we cannot generalize with one stroke: only the homespun cloth skirts and jackets of Hunan female students are worthy of admiration and should not be overlooked.

Under the political leadership of Chairman He Yunqiao in Hunan Province, the development of education is unmatched nationwide. Just in the first session, schools are everywhere, and those in charge are able to work hard and implement complete measures. The spirit of the students is also full of vitality, and especially the simple student uniforms are eye-catching in the prosperous streets. The students you see, regardless of gender, wear a uniform made of plain homespun cloth all year round, but rarely wear silk and wool fabrics; especially female students not only wear the same homespun cloth skirts and jackets, but also do not use cosmetics. As for the homespun raw materials for making clothes, they are purely self-spun, self-woven, and self-dyed from the countryside, which can be called completely domestic products.

Their clothing is mostly a kind of short jacket and short skirt. The upper body wears a plain homespun cloth jacket, and the lower body is matched with a knee-length plain homespun cloth skirt. The hair covering the forehead and bright eyes are on the right part of the chest, embroidered with the name of the school and the number listed in the school with white floss. Although they do not apply rouge or powder, that kind of light makeup and plain attire has a unique style and reveals a natural healthy beauty, which is unmatched by the female students in Jiangsu and Zhejiang who cut their hair and wear fashionable clothes.

### Heroines in the Spanish War (Part Two)

— Bo Ken

Ms. Victoria had never been to the front lines. She was too frail. But her thinking was very progressive. She argued that women joining the army not only encouraged male soldiers to want to perform meritorious service in front of women, but also made them work even harder. So as to maintain the traditional advantage of men over women in war.

Probably because she had always been good at organization, she is currently serving as the general manager of recruiting women's armies. The recruitment office is located in a new-style hotel in Barcelona, ​​with a wooden sign hanging at the door: "General Office of the Catalan Women's Camp" Inside, typists and stenographers were busy working. A long table was placed in the center, with four female committee members sitting at the top; they were reviewing about twenty prospective female soldiers arranged at the bottom. Among these Spanish women who volunteered to join the army were factory women in tattered clothes, smart and petite female shop assistants, female students who had studied education, and even luxurious socialites. One by one, they were summoned to the female committee members. Physical examinations are not required; a simple oral test and a quick look are enough. As a result, half were sent to the front lines and half remained in the rear to serve.

Women serving in the rear are divided into groups to perform three tasks—cooking, nursing the wounded, and taking care of the children of women who went to the front lines. Women who went to the front lines were also divided into groups and incorporated into three armies—infantry, artillery, and air force.

On the side of the Spanish rebels, there was also a prominent female warrior. Her name is Senorita Dolores. She was the daughter of the late Diec Teto. Of all the Spanish female warriors, she was the most beautiful.

It is said that Ms. Senorita Dolores once worked as a chauffeur for the "Death Patrols." In the Catalan provinces and cities occupied by the government forces, government military officers patrolled in cars every night. The death patrols on the rebel side wore clothes that imitated government military officers and rode in cars painted with the emblems of the government forces, mixed into the city. Seeing a government patrol car speeding towards them, they threw a bomb under its wheels. After the smoke cleared, only a pile of scrap iron and dismembered bodies remained. In this way, they galloped around, waiting for the patrol car to attack. When the whole city was rioting, they abandoned their cars and fled.

In this Spanish civil war, there was also a generous female warrior who died as a martyr. This is Ms. Anila Lopez. She was originally a clerk at a pharmacy in Merida, but later became an important assistant to Ms. Xifanlian and Ms. Victoria Gantuo. Her face was as ugly as a village woman, but she was a scholar. "She knows Latin," her villagers often praised her. She also knew Spanish history well. She remembered the story of Queen Isabella—Columbus's benefactor—leading the army to drive the Moors out of Spain.

When she heard the news that General Franco was leading the Moors to seize Merida, the traditional terror of Muslims made her begin emergency measures. She gathered the villagers and organized a defense team. She arranged to install landmines under streets, squares, and public buildings. She knew that by simply pressing a button, she could kill the enemy troops cleanly, although the entire village would also be turned into scorched earth.

However, when the enemy troops arrived, the idea of ​​cherishing the lives of the villagers immediately made her change her mind. She left the button and walked to the enemy troops, boldly captured. The savage Moorish soldiers tied her up unceremoniously, and merciless bullets instantly ended her life. Her last words were: "At least, I died too young." This shows that she was not afraid of death, but regretted dying without fulfilling her responsibilities.

### Japanese Bride Schools

— Shadow

Japan has bride schools, and although they have only existed for a few years, they have developed at a high speed in recent years, and their establishment has already affected general girls' high schools. The only reason why Japanese girls are unwilling to enter high schools and instead want to go to bride schools is that the tuition fees of bride schools are lower, and they can receive training in all the subjects required to be a Japanese wife in a very short period. The curriculum includes sewing, housework, flower arrangement, tea party preparation, and various etiquette for housewives. As for ordinary girls' high schools, it takes at least three years to complete all the subjects, saving both money and time, so that after graduating from middle school, most girls want to enter these bride schools.

According to Japanese newspapers, a girls' high school that had as many as four hundred students a few years ago now has only a little over one hundred. This is undoubtedly influenced by the bride schools, at least the length of the school year is a major reason. Therefore, the main way for Japanese girls' high schools to deal with these bride schools is to shorten the graduation period. It is said that some of the bride schools are founded and taught by female graduates of high schools. Now, except for medical and obstetrical schools for women, general girls' high schools have been affected, and the number of students is decreasing rapidly.

At the same time, we also know that in Japanese girls' middle schools, when students are about to graduate, a period of time is usually designated as bride training in the year before graduation. This is because these girls are about to graduate, and although some of them want to continue their studies after graduation, most of them are afraid that they will not be able to continue their education and will have to enter society to find a job to support themselves. Some of them are already of marriageable age, and it is even possible that they will get married. Although there are courses such as domestic science, sewing, and cooking in the curriculum during normal school hours, the Japanese school authorities believe that these are not enough, so they designate a period of time for specialized bride training to supplement the usual deficiencies.

The matter is very interesting. The female students do not even go home during training, but live in the school. They cook their own food, wash their own clothes, sweep the classrooms, and tidy the rooms. All the housework has to be done. In other words, everything a new bride should do has to be practiced. Japanese women have a natural obedience that is unmatched by women in any other country. The reason why schools implement new bride training is of course to hope that all female students can become good wives and mothers after marriage, and that after undergoing considerable training in school before marriage, they can handle everything in terms of housework without having to learn from their in-laws. Not only is this the case in Japanese girls' schools, but Japanese schools established by overseas Japanese also have special courses in new bride training in the final semester.

### Common Knowledge of Women and Bathing

— Cao Yixuan

Bathing is very effective for the health of body and mind. However, developing the habit of bathing and common knowledge of bathing are essential requirements for housewives. Now I will roughly talk about the points to pay attention to when bathing and the benefits of bathing: First, when you come back from outside after being blown by the cold wind, you must never take a bath immediately. Before bathing, you must warm your body first, because when the body is cold, the blood vessels in the skin are all contracted. Suddenly walking into the bathtub will cause the blood vessels to expand rapidly, then the contraction and expansion of the skin's blood vessels will be damaged, which is the cause of vascular diseases. If there is no bathing equipment in the home, and you go to a public bathhouse to take a bath, you should rest for twenty minutes after entering the bathhouse before taking off your clothes and entering the bath. Second, you should not take a bath immediately after strenuous exercise or mental labor. You should first calm your body or rest for an hour to restore your mental fatigue before taking a bath. Second, pay more attention to the temperature of the bath water. Do not immediately immerse yourself in very hot water. First, use low-temperature water of 38 to 40 degrees to soak your whole body for five minutes, then increase the water temperature to 42 to 43 degrees. For the elderly, women, and people with chronic kidney disease and arteriosclerosis, 40 degrees is appropriate, and 28 to 29 degrees is enough for children. Therefore, the bath water should be tested with a thermometer first. Fourth, you must never take a bath when you are hungry or full. You should wait eleven or twelve hours after eating. Winter is best before going to bed, because it is easy to fall asleep. After a normal bath, you must keep your body warm for an hour. Pregnant women should not soak in hot water for a long time, because prolonged high temperature in the lower abdomen will cause the uterine muscles to contract, often causing miscarriage. As for the reason why bathing can protect the health of body and mind, it is that bathing stimulates the skin and can promote the activity of internal organs. Generally, when living in a cold climate, the skin of the whole body is tense, and the spirit feels tired. At the same time, in order to prevent the loss of body temperature, the blood vessels of the whole body contract to the extreme, and the blood is sent to the internal organs. Because the blood vessels of the skin contract, the blood vessels of the brain also contract, so the blood circulation in the brain is also slow. That is, the nutrition in the brain is not good, and old waste accumulates and does not move. At this time, the spirit is tired, the nerves are excited, and the whole body feels more tired. On the other hand, the various centers that coordinate the functions of the internal organs lose nutrition due to the sluggish blood circulation, and the functions of the lungs, stomach, intestines, and endocrine organs are all adversely affected, and the body is naturally uncomfortable. Therefore, housewives should pay full attention to their children's bathing. Originally, the strength of children's bodies is entirely the responsibility of housewives. It is really shameful for housewives not to understand the common sense of bathing in modern society. The physiological effect of warm water bathing is of great significance to the skin, that is, there are many blood vessels in the skin, like a fine net. About half of the total amount of blood in our whole body is on the skin. Because after a warm bath, the skin is stimulated by warmth, then the many blood vessels in the skin expand at once, and a large amount of blood gathers on the surface of the skin. At the time, the blood distribution of the whole body undergoes a major change. In other words, when the blood vessels of the skin expand, the blood in the internal organs will contract. Therefore, bathing with warm water every day can make the functions of all parts of the body vigorous, increase appetite, and at the same time, the many nerves distributed on the skin have a close relationship with the internal organs. After bathing, because stimulating certain skin nerves can stimulate certain internal organs and increase their activity, that is, enhance the body's resistance and endocrine, as well as red and white blood cells, promote the body's metabolism, and because the blood vessels of the skin expand, the blood circulation in the brain is also good, increasing the nutrition of the brain, the spirit will be calm, the trachea of the skin will not be blocked, and the sweat and fat on the surface of the skin can be removed. This significant physiological phenomenon should be understood clearly.

### Things to Pay Attention to When Doing Beauty

— (Max Factor)

Almost every woman has to practice beauty, but the method of beauty must be noted, and there are also a few points to be aware of when doing beauty:

㊀ Do not do beauty in front of men. Many men say that women's beauty is unique to them. In other words, it is also their secret, so they cannot publicly break their own secrets in front of men. Logically speaking, when a man sees that a woman's beauty is obtained through beauty products, the impression of the woman's beauty will be fundamentally different.

㊁ Do not do beauty in public places. At banquets or on the street, it is not a place for beauty. It is best to be in a formal beauty salon or washroom.

㊂ Do not borrow other people's beauty products. Borrowing other people's beauty products to do beauty is not only unsanitary, but also enough to make people annoying. In addition, everyone's appearance is different, and the color of the beauty products is matched with each person's appearance, so it will naturally not be suitable for another person to use. Therefore, if every woman practices beauty, she should prepare her own set of beauty products.

㊃ Prepare beauty products for female guests. If you often have female guests visiting your home, it is best to prepare some beauty products for them to use when they accidentally lack beauty products. This is actually some etiquette of the host family, and it is something that a housewife should know.

### Women and Planting Flowers

— Wu Qiaofang

Flowers are beautiful in shape and bright in color. Women love flowers because their natures are similar.

Therefore, for women who love flowers, understanding the fun of planting flowers can increase the noble style in society and cultivate diligence in the family. The benefits are great and cannot be expressed in words. Europe, America, and Japan have been encouraging home gardening for decades, so women in these countries all have gardening knowledge. Even the application of floral decorations, such as corner flowers for dining tables, flowers for bottle feeding, and the collection and insertion of flowers in baskets, are all well-versed and can be done without asking for help. However, gardening is originally divided into three parts: fruit trees, vegetables, and flowers. Among the three, fruit trees and vegetables may require a large area of land, a lot of labor, abundant capital, or sophisticated technology, or it may take ten years to see the results, or it may require the mobilization of equipment to do it well. Why not flowers, which are the easiest to plant, require little effort, and are effective quickly. And flower beds are set up according to the amount of land, and flower pots are arranged everywhere. Even if it is only a garden of several bows, once planted, it is enough for morning and evening walks and appreciation in all seasons. The advantages are listed in the following four points:

Purifying the air. Generally, plants absorb carbon dioxide during the day and release oxygen at night. If people can make good use of it, their bodies will become healthier day by day. Women are simple and live in seclusion, and the air is easy to feel stale. Planting flowers at home can naturally purify it. Bottle feeding and potted plants are beautiful decorations, which is just extra. This is the hygienic benefit of planting flowers.

Expressing depression. Family affairs cannot always be satisfactory. Women are gentle and often accumulate depression, which is the root of disease. What can you do to relieve your worries if you are unfortunately in adversity from time to time? Only flowers, watching them contain fragrance and spit out beauty, competing for beauty and vying for beauty, as if seeing them, you will feel happy and suddenly eliminate your troubles. Roses contain smiles, and daylilies relieve sorrow. This is the second benefit of planting flowers for nourishing the mind.

Using nature. There are many kinds of plants in nature, and all are beautiful. If they are used properly, they can greatly increase the happiness of the family. For example, among the flowers, Sophora japonica in Jiangnan can eliminate shock and poison, Saxifraga stolonifera can cure injuries widely, roses can be used to make perfume, Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium is a medicine for repelling mosquitoes, fragrant jasmine causes a gentle breeze, and Bianzhu and Peilan quietly eliminate summer heat. There are countless colors and shapes. Only those who plant flowers can enjoy endless medicinal benefits. This is the third benefit of flowers regarding nature.

Verifying science. Since entering school, girls have learned a lot about planting, but due to the lack of teaching materials and incomplete specimens, academic theories are often empty and practical objects cannot be seen. If flowers are cultivated at home, they can be watched at any time, and unique categories can be extended. For example, the characteristics of anemophilous and entomophilous can be distinguished immediately, and the properties of woody and herbaceous plants can be known. By analogy, the physiological functions, organizational outlines, and propagation methods of plants can all be tested in practice, which benefits people's intelligence. Only those who plant flowers can easily receive such effects. This is the fourth benefit of flowers regarding the scientific world.

Others, such as sowing seeds and thinning seedlings, watering and fertilizing, and weeding and removing insects, are done every day, activating all the muscles and bones of the body, practicing labor and service, and being friends with flowers, cultivating aesthetic concepts. Those who are good at painting use it for sketching, and those who can write poetry use it for composing poems. With the help of beautiful flowers, the genius of women is further developed, and the two are beautiful and complementary, adding to each other's brilliance. Every family has a daughter who loves flowers. Women like flowers, and it is appropriate to plant them. In the future, the development of gardening in our country will start here, and family harmony will originate here. If we ask the women, there will be no different opinions. I hope you will take action quickly.

Last spring, the American Women's Association organized a women's gardening tour group (all aristocratic women) to travel around the world to investigate the gardening conditions of various countries. They visited Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and other places. In all the places they visited, only the local governments provided banquets as usual, and no other actions were heard. When they arrived in Japan, in addition to the local government's reception, gardening groups from various places held grand joint celebrations and gave fresh flowers produced in various places every day. It was very active and very enthusiastic. It is said that the tour group had a very good impression in Japan. As a result, after the group returned to their country, they purchased a large number of peonies and other floral gardening plants from Japan. From this, we can see the enthusiasm and interest of the American women's community in gardening research and the Japanese people's skill in doing business. (For information on flower planting materials and methods, you can write to Songxia Gardener of Songyin, Songjiang. You will surely receive a satisfactory answer.)

### Third Letter

— Zhuo Dai

Ms. B:

In your letter last week, you asked me: "What kind of flowers should I plant in the garden so that there are flowers to enjoy all year round?" This is indeed an interesting question!

Is it probably you yourself who want to plant more flowers and trees in the garden of your house? I have had this experience before. I planted a few flowering trees. Of course, they look good when they bloom, but sometimes there are no flowers to enjoy, and I feel that the garden is too lonely, especially in winter, which is even more boring. So later, when planting flowering trees, I often made their flowering periods connect, so that when flower A finishes blooming, flower B blooms again, and when flower B is about to fall, flower C is budding. Even in winter, there will not be no flowers to enjoy.

However, after studying it now, I realize that there is a problem with it. Having flowers in all seasons is completely unreasonable from the value of the garden. Our country has always called gardens flower gardens, but this statement is also problematic. You must know that most of the trees that bloom are deciduous trees, and very few are evergreen trees. If many flowering trees are planted in the garden, then many deciduous trees will be planted. Spring and summer are certainly lively, but when autumn comes, the leaves fall, and when you look at the garden, you only see many bare branches facing the sky. Isn't this a big eyesore? Therefore, modern gardeners often plant more evergreen trees and fewer deciduous trees, which is a very common formula. Planting more evergreen trees will prevent the sight of desolation in winter. If all evergreen trees are planted, it will be too monotonous, so you must add a few flowering deciduous trees to make it have different scenes in all seasons. The problem is not when there are no flowers to enjoy, but when you cannot even see the leaves, it is a big problem on the garden. Therefore, you must follow this formula. As for how to arrange evergreen trees and deciduous trees and what proportion to use, it depends on the direction, environment, and location of the garden. There cannot be a fixed number.

If people who like to see flowers find it too quiet because there is a time when the flowers are not blooming, there is also a good way to remedy it. You can draw a position in the most prominent place in the garden and make a flower bed. In this flower bed, plant many herbaceous flowers, which is lively. Originally, when looking at flowers, you don't necessarily have to look at woody flowers. Herbaceous flowers also have great appreciation value, and especially the herbaceous flowers planted by foreigners recently are very splendid. The garden really cannot do without them. Ordinary herbaceous flowers are often divided into two types, one for spring and one for autumn.

Then, a flower bed only blooms twice a year in spring and autumn. Isn't there still no flowers to see at other times? There is also a very wonderful way to make it have flowers constantly throughout the year.

It is best to have other open space to plant these herbaceous flowers, and only when they bloom, move these flowers to the flower bed for people to enjoy. At that time, another kind is planted in the open space again. When the flowers in the flower bed are about to wither, they are immediately taken away and replaced with other flowers. In this way, the flowers in the flower bed will never be cut off. Although herbaceous flowers are divided into spring and autumn, if some are planted early and some are planted late, they can also be connected.

With this method, the flowers can be forever continuous. Then the leaves that can permanently decorate the garden will also not be invisible at times. Why don't you try my method!

### Draining the Pond to Catch All the Fish is Not a Good Method

— Meng Ruo

Recently, the Shanghai French Concession authorities provoked a strike by all the national pharmacies in the concession because of urging the collection of the "Regulations on the Sale of Chinese Medicines in Retail Stores" tax, and the situation is quite serious. On the one hand, the Public Concession authorities also have a proposal to increase the municipal tax from this year, which has aroused panic among various industries in the concession, and they have sent letters requesting a stop. These two matters are of great importance to all industries. Now I will come out as a third party and say a few words.

The reason for the Public Concession's increase in tax is said to be because of financial exhaustion, so it will implement an increase in tax to help it. As for the reason for the French Concession's collection of new tax, it has not yet been announced, but it is probably no more than a financial problem. It is originally possible to collect new tax or increase tax due to financial exhaustion, but this must be subject to conditions. ㊀ It should be based on the law, ㊁ It should take into account the ability of the counter-taxpayers.

According to the national pharmacies, the authorities' collection of the "Regulations Tax" is not based on the law, but the authorities say that this is implemented according to the Public Works Bureau's method. This point belongs to the legal aspect, and I don't want to say much. As for asking whether the various industries currently have the ability to pay the new tax, I dare to say that they cannot afford it.

The fact is in front of people. The Shanghai market has been declining in recent years due to the impact of the economic panic. This can be seen from the successive bankruptcies of various industries and the flags of store sales. Therefore, now various industries do not say that they are unable to pay the new tax or increased tax. I am afraid that even other taxes have the pain of being unable to bear them. It can be seen that under the current situation, collecting new tax or increasing tax is no different from draining the pond to catch all the fish. No matter how sufficient the reasons held by the authorities are, the method is extremely inappropriate.

As for the French Concession authorities' use of water and electricity cuts to oppress the national pharmacies, it is even more illegal to provoke a strike by all the same industries. Because the issue of collecting the Regulations Tax, even if it must be implemented, must be resolved through proper methods. Cutting off water and electricity is really enough to affect people's business and life. Moreover, since the national pharmacies have no arrears in water and electricity bills, the authorities have no right to cut them off.

Now the Public Concession's proposal to increase tax has not yet been implemented. I hope the authorities will take into account the difficult situation of the various industries and stop it automatically. And the French Concession's urging to collect the new tax has provoked a strike by all the national pharmacies in the concession, and the matter has a dogmatic trend. We hope that both parties will discuss a solution as soon as possible.

### Mist

— Shen Jiaqian

The sky congeals with milky white water vapor, heavy like a lead block pressing on the chest, making breathing urgent. This is the third day of heavy fog.

A tram fresh from the factory lit its electric lamp, the conductor repeatedly ringing the bell to warn pedestrians and vehicles ahead. There were no passengers in the vehicle. The electric lamp seemed like a star in the sky. A blurred black shadow collapsed in the corner of the carriage, probably the ticket seller dozing off? The rickshaw pullers hunched their backs, tucking the rickshaw frame into their waists, staggering along the roadside, slithering along. There was a small food stall there, an oil lamp trembling in the rising fumes, the rickshaw pullers all parked their vehicles here, surrounding the stall to buy snacks; there were also one or two rickshaw pullers casting their sharp eyes, searching for their first customer on the pier and sidewalk—they often left home without a penny, and only bought their breakfast after doing a business.

The street cleaner in the red vest, leaned against the telephone pole, gazing at the distant Huangpu River, where a warship flying the Union Jack was docked. Perhaps this was not his goal, he was reminiscing about his blurred home across the river, where there was an elderly mother or a child being breastfed, waiting for him to earn money to buy winter clothes! He was lost in thought, his fingers, stiff with cold, stuck in the pocket of his vest, standing still, the broom like an abandoned woman, lying at his feet.

In the congealed air, the bell rang again. Now it was not the bell on the tram, the street cleaner's hearing was still very sharp, he knew that his companion had already led the garbage donkey cart from across the street. He immediately warmed his fingers with his breath, grabbed the broom from the ground, as if someone was about to snatch it from him, diligently sweeping in the middle of the street, and by the time he could see clearly the face of the person leading the donkey cart, a high pile of garbage had already accumulated next to the telephone pole.

They nodded in greeting, the one pulling the donkey cart searched out two crumpled cigarette butts from his pocket, they lit them in the direction of the windbreak, and as two streams of thick smoke mixed into the fog layer, they talked in low voices about some irrelevant things, almost forgetting that their work was not yet finished, while the donkey was shaking the copper bell on its neck to warn them.

The rickshaw puller who had just been pulling an empty cart had done business and returned, and brought another guest, who was obviously catching the first liner to the inland rivers. Although the clock on the Jianghai Customs could not be seen, the sailors on the liner had not neglected their duty and had already sounded the second echo.

People had gathered from who knows when and where, crowding on the pier, where a true picture of life was on display: there were sons seeing their fathers home, and wives reluctant to part with their newly married husbands, those who had made a fortune were indeed smiling, dreaming of returning home, and those who had borrowed a final sum from relatives and friends in their hometown were perhaps cursing Shanghai for not having room for them!

The ruthless liner sounded its third echo, separating joys and sorrows on the pier, bravely breaking through the thick fog layer and heading towards the center of the river, the hearts left on the pier hanging in the air. As the ship's shadow gradually sank into the milky white air, they turned around, and the rickshaw pullers surrounded them like a swarm of bees.

The thick fog gradually thinned, and chaos and haste revealed the original shape of the city.

A group of urchins curled up in the corner of the wall of a warehouse, covering their bodies with newspapers, they had fortunately survived another winter night!

But, "Three days of heavy fog bring west winds," perhaps heaven is brewing a "lucky snow" for the wealthy to celebrate the New Year!

### Historical Materials on the "Number One Dish in the World"

— Fan Gen

Recently, major newspapers across the country have carried many news reports about the "Number One Dish in the World" invented by Chairman Chen of Jiangsu Province. Because the author is acquainted with Mr. Chen, I met with him a few days ago, inquired about the details, and quickly recorded the general outline for the readers.

The "Number One Dish in the World" is made of shrimp meat, chicken soup, tomatoes, and pot rice (some newspapers mistakenly wrote "tomatoes" as "chilies"). It was not originally invented by Mr. Chen, but he discovered its advantages, improved it, and gave it its name. It happened in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China when Mr. Chen went to Hangzhou. He was dining at a small restaurant and found this dish. However, it was not yet the combination of the four ingredients. Mr. Chen saw its bright color, the crispness of the pot rice, the delicious taste, and the pleasant sound of the pot rice entering the soup, with a fragrant aroma. He thought it was a good dish with sound, aroma, color, and taste, and its price was only a few cents, so he often remembered it when eating. A friend invited him to a banquet at Jufeng Garden, and Mr. Chen proposed using this dish instead of shark fin. Usually, shark fin is used as the main dish in banquets to show respect to guests. However, shark fin is expensive, mostly foreign goods, and only tastes thick and greasy, not as delicious as this dish. Afterwards, Mr. Chen often promoted the benefits of this dish to his friends, but he had not yet given it a name. Mr. Chen had a cousin studying in Belgium who was not used to foreign food and cooked her own meals. Mr. Chen wrote to her telling her how to make this dish, its various advantages, and said that if it was prepared well, it could be called the best dish in the world. His cousin followed the method and was very satisfied, telling her foreign friends about it. Everyone was surprised by its four perfections, and they all competed to make it. Thus, this dish was introduced to foreign countries at that time. Later, after Mr. Chen took charge of Jiangsu Province, the Jiangsu Goods Exhibition closed. A grand banquet was held for the guests, and he ordered the chef to make pure Jiangsu dishes to entertain them, in line with the meaning of Jiangsu goods. The dishes were complete, which can be said to be a culmination of Jiangsu cuisine. At the same time, this dish was also included, and it was determined that the ingredients would be shrimp meat, chicken soup, tomatoes, and pot rice, without adding other ingredients, and its name was set as "Number One Dish in the World." Many people thought that the "Number One Dish in the World" and "Jiangsu Cuisine" were born at the same time, but this dish already had a history of several years. The news reports in the newspapers recently are actually old news.

After that, Mr. Chen always prepared this dish for banquets, so most of those who had attended Mr. Chen's banquets had tasted it. At the end of the year, he personally wrote a eulogy, pointing out the advantages of this dish and adding many sentences that encourage ambition based on the ingredients. The wording was grand, and the eulogy said: "This is called the Number One Dish in the World, with color, sound, aroma, and taste all complete. Banquets are not only for the benefit of the mouth, but also for the eyes, ears, and nose. This dish is nourishing and not expensive, and can replace swallow's nest or shark fin. Tomatoes, pot rice, chicken, and shrimp are not only delicious but also good for the stomach. Dry and wet, moving and still, Chinese and foreign, land and sea ingredients are gathered together. Be brave to fight the enemy and be able to yield and stretch. Ambition can be inspired by things. I solemnly promote it today, hoping to enjoy it with every meal." For the sake of popularization, he printed the eulogy on small pieces of paper and distributed them to the guests at the New Year's Day banquet this year. A reporter from the local newspaper obtained it and published it in the newspaper.

Recently, Zhenjiang people have boasted that there are three things in Zhenjiang that are the best in the world: one is the best river and mountain in the world, in Beigushan, inscribed by Yan Lu Wu Ju; one is the best spring in the world, near Jinshan Temple, which seems to be inscribed by Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty; and the other is Chairman Chen's Number One Dish in the World.

### "Smuggling" and "Our Hometown"

Premiering at the Penglai Grand Theater

"Smuggling" and "Our Hometown", performed by the Torch Drama Society, are scheduled to premiere today at the Penglai Grand Theater across from the Penglai Market in Nanshi.

The cast is extraordinarily solid, including Xia Xia, Qian Feng, He Bin, Ding Ning, Ma Hu, Zhao Shan, Zhang Hong, Zhang Yi, Wang Di, and Huang He. In addition to Xia Xia's excellent acting skills being recognized by all sectors, the others are all key members of the Shanghai Theater, Suzhou Film Studio, Jinan Film Company, and Haiyan Drama Society, and have been engaged in theatrical work for many years. With the serious direction of Mr. Ling He and Mr. Liu Liu, the performance effect must be good. However, the society is not complacent about this, and plans to hold a trial performance this afternoon to invite the press and theater circles to give guidance and assistance.

### Cathay Screens "Commoner Emperor"

George Arliss's New Work

Silver Screen Jester George Arliss has been away from Shanghai for a long time. Now his work "The Commoner Emperor" (The King's Vacation) is scheduled to open today at the Cathay Grand Theater, which is not a good news for the film industry. George Arliss plays a king with a peculiar personality in the film. Because the life of the emperor is too restrictive, every move cannot be free. When a revolution breaks out in the country, he actually rises up and joins hands with the revolutionaries, preferring to abandon the throne. The plot is satirical and the performance is humorous. Arliss's acting skills are, of course, transcendent and need no further comment. In addition to Arliss, there are also big stars such as Dick Powell, Mrs. Arliss, and Patricia Ellis co-starring, which adds a lot to the film.

### About Amateur Actors

The third major performance of amateur actors has been decided to be staged at the Carlton Theater in the city starting on the 24th of this month. The programs include three plays, "Demon of Desire", "Thunderstorm", and "Living in a Dream", all of which are world famous works. The definite news is: two theaters in Nanjing have contacted the Actor Association to negotiate the matter of going to Nanjing to perform over the years. The amateur has sent people to make contact and carry out the matter, and plans to re-stage "Nora" and "The Government Inspector" together. The picture above is Wang Weiyi's makeup in "Demon of Desire".
