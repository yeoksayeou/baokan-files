### Liu Guitang Organizes North China Puppet Anti-Communist Army

Secretly Receives Huge Sums of Money from a Certain Party. Airplanes Send Him to the Border to Harass

[Tianjin] Liu Guitang has recently accepted huge sums of money from a certain party and organized the North China Anti-Communist Army. Liu is the Commander-in-Chief. On the 26th, he and his old subordinates were sent by a certain party by airplane to the border of Suiyuan and Mongolia to command the bandit troops and resist the Righteous Army of Chahar North.

### Legislative Yuan Meeting Passes National General Budget for the 26th Year

Central Reserve Bank Law Discussed in Closed Session. Resolved to Approve with Amendments Based on Review Results of the Three Committees

[Nanjing] The Legislative Yuan held its 109th regular meeting at 8 AM on the 25th, with 61 members including Wei Tingsheng present. Chairman Sun Ke and Secretary-General Liang Hancao read the minutes of the previous meeting. Then, the Chairman announced a change in the agenda, first reviewing the General Budget of Ordinary Revenue and Expenditure for the 26th year. It was resolved to approve the draft and adopt the review opinions of the Finance, Economics, Legal, Foreign Affairs, and Military Affairs Committees, with four attached recommendations to the National Government: 1. The issue of special funds for construction projects: A. According to Article 5 of the current budget regulations, "National and local budgets are divided into ordinary accounting and business accounting." Now, a separate estimate is compiled for the special funds for construction projects and only sent to the Legislative Yuan for reference, which is inconsistent with current laws and regulations. It seems that the estimate for the special funds for construction projects should be compiled into a budget and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. B. According to the Budget Law, which will be implemented on July 1, 27th year, special funds for construction projects should be included in the general budget. The parts that should be kept secret can be "not published" in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 2 of Article 45 of the Budget Law. 2. The business budget has not yet been compiled and submitted for review. Starting from the next fiscal year, it should be prepared and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review in accordance with the law. 3. The budget for the Boxer Indemnity and other special funds should be prepared and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review in accordance with the law starting from the next fiscal year. 4. The total amount of financial fees is more than 69 million yuan, accounting for 6.92% of the total expenditure. Except for military affairs and debt expenses, financial fees are the highest. It should be recommended to effectively reduce them to save expenses. Then, the first supplementary budget for ordinary revenue and expenditure of the State for the 25th year was reviewed. It was resolved to approve the supplementary budget based on the review results of the Finance, Economics, Legal, Foreign Affairs, and Military Affairs Committees. The supplementary revenue and expenditure were 79,911,626.833 yuan each. At this point, the Chairman announced a change to a closed meeting to review the Central Reserve Bank Law. It is reported that it was resolved to approve the amendments based on the review results of the Finance, Economics, and Commercial Law Committees. The full text consists of 12 chapters and 61 articles. In addition, the Provisional Measures for the Reorganization of the Central Bank were also resolved to approve the amendments based on the review results of the Finance, Economics, and Commercial Law Committees. The full text consists of 12 articles. At this point, it was already noon, and the Chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting, scheduling a temporary meeting to be held at 3 PM to review other routine cases. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)

### Experts' Views on the Budget

[Nanjing] The General Budget of Ordinary Revenue and Expenditure of the State for the 26th year has a revenue and expenditure of 1,000,649,496 yuan each (according to the figure, 18 yuan more than previously announced). According to a certain financial expert, the budget has special funds for construction projects of 70 million yuan on the expenditure side, and there are no debts or hypothetical revenues on the revenue side. The revenue and expenditure figures are indeed able to balance, which is truly a new era in our country's financial history. The revenue budget lists customs duties, salt taxes, consolidated taxes, income taxes, tobacco and alcohol taxes, mining taxes, etc., all of which have a significant increase compared to the previous year, and also lists 2 million yuan for the estate tax currently being planned. Other business income and administrative income have also slightly increased. If there are no major unexpected events in the domestic economic situation and the recovery of agriculture, industry, and commerce in recent years, there should be no shortage. Also, although the increase in military expenditure in the expenditure budget is large compared to the previous year, 70 million yuan of military expenditures in various provinces are either transferred from subsidies or are newly added, which is of great significance to the unification of military administration and military orders. The Ministry of Military Administration has always had disagreements in managing regular military expenditures. Before preparing the military expenditure budget this time, the military administration and financial authorities consulted and settled on it, and mutually declared that they would follow the budget from now on and no longer request funds or add budgets in case of emergencies as in previous years. This method is indeed a feature of this case. Secondly, although debt expenses have also increased, the increase is based on laws and contracts and is an unavoidable expenditure. In addition, all other expenditures have generally increased slightly, which is actually because political construction has been actively promoted in recent years, and in fact there is no way to reduce it. Looking at the spirit of the entire budget, there has been progress compared to previous years. We should also say that the government should instruct all agencies to strive for frugality in administrative expenses within the scope of the budget, so that there will be a surplus to use for construction projects and actively engage in production so that their funds can be circulated. It is also heard that the Legislative Yuan is currently rushing to prepare a memorial to submit the General Budget of Ordinary Revenue of the State for the 26th year to the National Government for promulgation before the fiscal year to comply with the spirit of the budget.

### Further Hearing of Shen Junru's Case

Awaiting Further Investigation Before Rescheduling

[Suzhou] The case against Shen Junru and others, accused of endangering the Republic of China, was re-heard yesterday morning at 9:30 AM. The court adjourned for lunch at noon, resumed the hearing at 2:30 PM, and concluded the court session at 4:35 PM. The presiding judge immediately retired with the jurors to deliberate. At 6:05 PM, they returned to the court and announced that they would await further investigation of the evidence before rescheduling the hearing. The details are as follows:

Rehearing

The defendants Shen Junru, Zhang Naiqi, Wang Zaoshi, Li Gongpu, Zou Taofen, Sha Qianli, Shi Liang, and Luo Qing were brought to the court at around 9 AM. Defendants Gu Liuxin and Ren Songgao also reported to the court and waited in the criminal waiting room. At 9:30 AM, Zhu Zongzhou, the presiding judge of the Second Criminal Court of the Jiangsu High Court, along with jurors Li Yue and Zhang Zepu, prosecutor Weng Zannian, and clerk Guan Lifei, arrived at the First Court to begin the rehearing. Apart from news reporters and family members of the defendants, all other spectators were prohibited from attending.

Individual Interrogation

After the court was called to order, the defense attorneys for Shen Junru, Qin Liankui, Liu Chongyou, and Li Zhaofu; the defense attorneys for Zhang Naiqi, Zhang Zhirang, Lu Hongyi, and Wu Zenshan; the defense attorneys for Wang Zaoshi, Jiang Yong, Li Guozhen, and Li Yujun; the defense attorneys for Li Gongpu, Yu Zhong, Luo E'sen, and Chen Zhigao; the defense attorneys for Zou Taofen, Liu Chongyou, and Sun Zuji; the defense attorneys for Sha Qianli, Jiang Yiping, Xu Zuoliang, and Wang Baoji; the defense attorneys for Shi Liang, Yu Chengxiu, Yu Zhongluo, and Liu Zuwang; the defense attorneys for Luo Qing, Zhu Siyao, and Xie Ju; the defense attorneys for Ren Songgao, Li Wenjie, and Jing Shujian; and the defense attorneys for Gu Liuxin, Tang Hao, and Zhuang Xiang, all took their seats in court. Presiding Judge Zhu Zongzhou first called each defendant and asked them their age, occupation, and address. Then, Prosecutor Weng Zannian stood up and read the indictment. Subsequently, the presiding judge ordered all the defendants to leave the courtroom, leaving only Shen Junru in the court for individual interrogation.

Main Points of the Court Hearing

The main points of the presiding judge's interrogation of the defendants included: ㊀ the organization of the various National Salvation Associations; ㊁ the meaning of "uniting all parties and factions" and "establishing a unified anti-Japanese regime" in the declaration of the National Salvation Association; ㊂ the sentences in the book "Several Basic Conditions and Minimum Requirements for Unity Against Insults" that were suspected of being pro-communist; ㊃ the difference between the People's United National Salvation Front and the People's Front; ㊄ the relationship between the National Salvation Association and Mao Zedong and the Communist Party; ㊅ criticism of the draft constitution; ㊆ whether the defendants were involved in the strikes in Japanese-owned yarn factories and student strikes; ㊇ what relationship they had with Zhang Xueliang and whether there was a causal relationship with the Xi'an Incident; ㊇ the publication of national salvation intelligence; ㊉ the main purpose of releasing political prisoners. The presiding judge repeatedly questioned the above issues with an unusually amiable attitude. The testimonies of the defendants were largely the same, and the main points of the testimonies were exactly the same as those given during the first court hearing on the 11th. However, they all stated that the points listed in the prosecutor's indictment were taken out of context and deliberately fabricated. (Central News Agency)

Question and Answer Record

First Interrogation of Shen Junru
Official (Q): When was the Shanghai Cultural Circles National Salvation Association established?
(A): December of the 24th year.
(Q): How many standing committee members are there in the Shanghai Cultural Circles National Salvation Association? Are you a member of the standing committee?
(A): I can't remember clearly. I am a member of the standing committee.
(Q): When was the Shanghai All Circles National Salvation Association established?
(A): During the March 8th anniversary in the 25th year.
(Q): Does the Shanghai All Circles National Salvation Association include the Professional National Salvation Association, the Cultural Circles National Salvation Association, the Women's Circles National Salvation Association, and the National Crisis Education Society?
(A): Yes, and there is also a University Professors National Salvation Association.
(Q): When was the National All Circles National Salvation United Association established? Where was the meeting held?
(A): May 31st of last year at the YMCA.
(Q): What is the purpose of the National Salvation Association?
(A): Very simple, to resist Japan and save the country. There is no other purpose other than resisting Japan.
(Q): Were the declarations and outlines of the National Salvation Association passed by the general assembly?
(A): Yes.
(Q): Who drafted them?
(A): Several people.
(Q): Were you one of them?
(A): I was one of them.
(Q): What is the content of the declaration?
(A): It requires all parties and factions in the country to abandon their prejudices and quickly resist Japan under the leadership of the government.
(Q): What does the outline mean?
(A): It is a suggestion, hoping that all parties and factions will unite to resist Japan from the perspective of the people.
(Q): What is the difference between the "People's Front" you mentioned and the "People's National Salvation Front"?
(A): The two are not the same. "People's Front" is for domestic use and cannot be used casually. For example, the "People's Front" in France and Spain is completely against domestic fascism. "People's National Salvation Front" advocates national unity against foreign aggression. Moreover, we have never used "People's Front." Zou Taofen even taught readers in the newspaper last July not to use this term to avoid causing misunderstandings. It is wrong to use this term in the indictment to slander us.
(Q): Which parties and factions are you referring to when you say unite all parties and factions?
(A): It refers to the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the so-called Third Party. Factions refer to the Nationalist faction. I am a member of the Kuomintang.
(Q): Do you oppose the suppression of communists when you advocate stopping the civil war?
(A): We believe that internal friction consumes too much power, and the situation in Guangdong and Guangxi is often tense. Therefore, we advocate that all parties and factions should unite to resist Japan.
(Q): Does your advocacy of releasing political prisoners refer to communists?
(A): It includes all those who are arrested for different political views, not just communists. This has always been a general proposition in recent years. For example, at several meetings of the Kuomintang Central Committee, some central committee members also made this proposal.
(Q): What is the meaning of introducing negotiations between the various parties and factions in the National Salvation Association's program, and how should it be introduced?
(A): This is just a suggestion to the various parties and factions, with the intention of discussing ways to resist Japan.
(Q): Does the program say that establishing a unified anti-Japanese regime means forming another government?
(A): No, unified means that the government unites all parties and factions, and the people resist Japan under the leadership of the government. This is supporting the government and does not mean opposing it.
(Q): What guarantee is there for the united anti-Japanese effort of all parties and factions?
(A): The National Salvation Association is not a political party, it's like glue. It binds all kinds of forces together to unanimously resist foreign aggression.
(Q): The outline says that if one party does not comply, sanctions will be imposed. How exactly will sanctions be imposed?
(A): We advocate that the central government should come out to lead the national resistance against Japan. If one party does not comply, only the central government can stop it.
(Q): Can the Communist Party abandon its ideology when resisting Japan?
(A): This is a matter for the Communist Party and has nothing to do with the National Salvation Association. The National Salvation Association only asks whether one resists Japan or not. In the past, some people said that the Communist Party would not give up their ideology to resist Japan. However, after the Xi'an Incident, the facts proved that the Communist Party was willing to abandon its previous class struggle policy to unite and resist Japan. This is entirely the hope of the people, and the right to unite or not lies with the central government.
(Q): The Communist Party has an ideology, I'm afraid it can't be united?
(A): The union refers to resisting Japan, not discussing ideology.
(Q): Your four's pamphlet advocates uniting all parties and factions, mainly the Communist Party. What does that mean?
(A): Apart from the Kuomintang, of course, the Communist Party is one of the largest political parties in China, but the Kuomintang is in the highest position.
(Q): You also said that the Communist Party has an indication of resisting Japan, how do you know?
(A): I saw it in the newspaper.
(Q): When did you receive Mao Zedong's letter?
(A): June or July last year.
(Q): Did your pamphlet send to Mao Zedong first?
(A): No, he said he saw it in the newspaper himself, which is proof.
(Q): Is the Spark Reading Club a Communist Party organization?
(A): I don't know. The National Salvation Association does not have such a group participating.
(Q): Did you incite the strike at the Japanese yarn factory in advance?
(A): We did not incite it. We only found out about it in the newspaper.
(Q): Is the Shanghai student strike related to the National Salvation Association?
(A): Please specify which one.
(Q): December of the 24th year.
(A): Where? If the presiding judge asks us, of course he has evidence. Please point it out. (The defendant's attitude was agitated, and the presiding judge flipped through the files for a long time.)
(Q): Luo Qing, did you meet at Zou Taofen's house?
(A): I have not met him. The indictment says that I met him at Zhang Naiqi's house. Is it at the Zou's house or the Tong's house! The presiding judge just said the strike, which time does he refer to? Please explain clearly.
(Q): (The judge flips the file for a long time) December 23 of the 24th year.
(A): Which Shanghai strike is it? Is it one school? Please find out.
(Q): You requested to investigate Zhang Xueliang. What do you mean?
(A): We have nothing to do with the Xi'an Incident, but the indictment insists that we have a major relationship. If we are convicted like this, we will not accept it.
(Q): What else do you want to investigate?
(A): There are many things. I have already submitted a petition to the Criminal Division of the Junyuan. There are a dozen items, the declaration of the Third Plenary Session, etc. As for the strike, please be sure to explain the facts. (The prosecutor stood up and asked,) During the Xi'an Incident, did Zhang Xueliang's proposal to convene a national salvation conference similar to your national salvation conference? (The presiding judge asked) Is it the same? (A): This requires asking Zhang Xueliang. (Lawyer Zhang Zhirang stood up and spoke) Whether the national salvation conference proposed by Zhang Xueliang is the same as the national salvation conference advocated by the National Salvation Association, it is necessary to compare the opinions of both parties. It is necessary to investigate Zhang Xueliang. (Q): Do you advocate that the establishment of a unified anti-Japanese regime means that Zhang Xueliang reorganized the government? (A): All documents of the National Salvation Association never mentioned reorganizing the government. It is wrong for the indictment to insist that we have the same views as Zhang. Regarding the strike, please investigate and clarify whether it is the entire Shanghai or one school. Who is instigating?

Second Interrogation of Zhang Naiqi
(Q): What is the meaning of the National Salvation Association's declaration and program?
(A): They are almost the same. They all explain the meaning of unity and resisting insults.
(Q): How to explain the joint formulation of a national salvation program and the establishment of an anti-Japanese regime?
(A): It is hoped that the central government will have a unified regime, not that we will "establish" it. The words "promote" and "non-controversial regime" before and after this sentence can prove that its intention is not to reorganize the government.
(Q): Do you oppose the constitution?
(A): Resisting Japan is the priority, and the constitution is secondary. If the country is destroyed, there is no way to implement the constitution.
(Q): You said that the main parties and factions are the Communists?
(A): The Kuomintang leads the various parties and factions. Among the various parties and factions being led, the main one is the Communist Party.
(Q): Is your advocacy of resisting Japan the same as that of the Communist Party?
(A): I think the presiding judge also advocates the same as me.
(Q): You said that the National Assembly is "closed-doorism"?
(A): The election of the National Assembly was originally designated. Now it has been revised. It can be seen that our criticism is not without reason.
(Q): This is a legal issue. You said that there is no need for a constitution at all?
(A): We only stand on the people's point of view and criticize it.
(Q): Is your proposal the same as the Seventh Congress of the Third International?
(A): I don't understand. Which point is the same?
(Q): Do you advocate a national defense government?
(A): I have never said that. This is taking the indictment out of context.
(Q): Are you a member of the Kuomintang?
(A): I have been working in the financial industry and have not joined a political party.
(Q): What is the meaning of petitioning for the 3 million people of Shanghai?
(A): Last October, Japanese soldiers were stationed all over Hongkou, Shanghai. The Japanese soldiers sent a large number of traitors to carry out activities. We were likely to be deceived, so we had to train them as our own strength.
(Q): Do you support the Communist Party's anti-Japanese policy?
(A): Everyone in the country agrees to resist Japan. I'm afraid the presiding judge also agrees.
(Q): Did Xi'an have National Salvation Associations participating in the National Salvation Congress?
(A): No.
(Q): What evidence do you want to investigate?
(A): ㊀ Investigate Zhang Xueliang for collusion. ㊁ Ma Xiangbo will guarantee with his head that national salvation is innocent. Please investigate Ma.

Third Interrogation of Wang Zaoshi
(Q): Did you join the Production Party?
(A): I don't know what the Production Party is at all.
(Q): Did you join the China National Revolutionary Alliance?
(A): I don't know this organization at all.
(Q): Do you know someone named Hu?
(A): I don't know him.
(Q): He has already surrendered and confessed you.
(A): I don't know.
(Q): What is the purpose of the National Salvation Association's declaration and program?
(A): "Resist Japan and save the country" are the four major characters.
(Q): Is the method to unite with Russia and tolerate the Communists?
(A): We advocate uniting all countries in the Far East that are in conflict with Japan's interests, including Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. As for tolerating the Communists, we have never said that.
(Q): The Communist Party is international and has no motherland. What sincerity do they have in resisting Japan?
(A): They used to advocate class struggle. Later, I saw in the newspaper that they were willing to unite and resist Japan under the leadership of the central government.
(Q): Do you know that the Communist Party wants to organize a national defense government?
(A): This is a matter for the Communist Party.
(Q): Do you advocate the establishment of a unified regime, which is to reorganize the government?
(A): No, the first purpose of unification is to resist Japan. (The rest of the answers are the same as Shen's)

Fourth Interrogation of Li Gongpu
(Q): What is the purpose of the National Salvation Association's declaration and program?
(A): Resist Japan and save the country.
(Q): Is uniting all parties and factions tolerating the Communists?
(A): Different. Uniting all parties is the common proposition from top to bottom since the National Crisis Conference after September 18th. The content is to eliminate prejudices and resist Japan together. The prosecutor is making a fuss and involving it in tolerating the Communists. It's really ignorant.
(Q): Does the Communist Party also advocate resisting Japan?
(Q): Yes. (A): Does the Communist Party want to establish a national defense government?
(A): This has nothing to do with us.
(Q): Is the so-called establishment of a unified anti-Japanese regime referring to that national defense government?
(A): I didn't have the opportunity to see the Communist Party's proposal. I only learned about it after seeing the indictment. Fundamentally, the two have no relationship at all.
(Q): Isn't there the establishment of an anti-Japanese regime in the National Salvation Association's declaration and program?
(A): I am very surprised that some people now think that if the Communist Party says something, others cannot say it. If the Communist Party says to resist Japan, others cannot say to resist Japan. The country is in such a crisis. Since the Communist Party is willing to resist Japan, we certainly welcome it. As for the Communist Party's determination to resist Japan, that is not something I know. I don't think even the presiding judge and the prosecutor would know. It is too far-fetched to say that the establishment of a national defense government proposed by the Communist Party is related to the anti-Japanese regime we proposed.
(Q): Your proposition is to tolerate the Communists?
(A): We take resisting Japan as the biggest premise. We must unite with all anti-Japanese forces at home and abroad.
(Q): What if the Communist Party doesn't give up its ideology and makes trouble in the rear?
(A): We have the power of the people to sanction it.
(Q): Do you know that you are being used by the Communist Party?
(A): 400 million people want to resist Japan. I believe that the presiding judge also resists Japan. Are you also being used by the Communist Party?
(Q): What guarantee does the Communist Party have to resist Japan?
(A): During the thirteenth year, Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated tolerating the Communists. Was Mr. Sun Yat-sen wrong? It is not wrong. Whether to unite or not depends on the situation. Unite when necessary and do not unite when not necessary. National policy is different from ideology.
(Q): The rest of the questions and answers are the same as Shen Junru.

Fifth Interrogation of Zou Taofen
(Q): Did you participate in the founding meeting of the National All Circles National Salvation Congress?
(A): I was running the Life Daily in Hong Kong and did not participate. I only found out that I was elected as an executive committee member when I returned to Shanghai in August after receiving a notice. (Zou's answer was unusually loud and his attitude was extremely激昂)
(Q): Do you agree with the Congress' declaration and political program?
(A): I completely agree.
(Q): What is the purpose of the National Salvation Congress?
(A): There is a sentence in the declaration, "Our only purpose is to concentrate all our efforts to deal with Japan."
(Q): Does advocating the union of all parties and factions mean tolerating the Communists?
(A): It refers to all parties and factions, including the Communist Party. There are words about the solidarity of all parties and factions in the oath of the National Crisis Conference in the 23rd year, in the declaration of the Third Plenary Session, in the words of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and in the letter of the Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. It was already 12 o'clock. The lawyer requested to rest and have lunch. At 2:30 in the afternoon, the court continued and continued to question Zou Taofen.
(Q): The Life Daily says that the People's Front is the same as the People's National Salvation Front, is it?
(A): I remember very clearly that last July, a reader wrote a letter and used the four characters "People's Front." I replied in the letter that it is good to unite and resist Japan, but there is something wrong with using the four characters "People's Front." It should not be used again in the future to avoid misunderstandings. The indictment says that I talked about the People's Front, isn't it taking things out of context and fabricating crimes?
(Q): Is your advocacy of establishing a unified anti-Japanese regime the same as the Communist Party's national defense government?
(A): In terms of words, they are not the same.
(Q): Do you know that the Communist Party does not give up its ideology, but just changes its strategy?
(A): This is a matter for the Communist Party. We only ask whether it resists Japan or not. As long as the Communist Party can resist Japan, the central government should lead them.
(Q): Do you know about the Spark Reading Club?
(A): I didn't know anything about it before. I only learned about it in the Public Security Bureau.
(Q): Does the National Salvation Association have secret organizations?
(A): Since it is secret, of course, I don't know about it.
(Q): What does establishing a unified regime mean?
(A): The declaration of the Third Plenary Session this year said, "Since July last year, a unified regime has gradually formed." This shows that it was not unified before July. (The prosecutor stood up and spoke) The defendant just said that this prosecutor is taking things out of context and fabricating crimes, which is wrong. You gave Zhang Xueliang a telegram and told him to send troops to resist Japan. He did not get the order from the central government. How could he resist Japan? Moreover, he is very far away from Suiyuan, and in fact he cannot resist Japan. This prosecutor represents the country in exercising his powers. The defendant cannot arbitrarily criticize. (A): I just said that taking things out of context and fabricating crimes refers to the People's Front, but the prosecutor involved the issue of Zhang Xueliang, which is completely irrelevant. (He spoke very激昂) If the presiding judge thinks the prosecutor's words are correct, then please don't say anything more. (The presiding judge repeatedly shook his head to stop him from speaking, but the defendant ignored it and continued to say) The defendant was just speaking, but was refuted by the prosecutor, so I have the right to defend myself. The presiding judge chose the telegram sent by the National Salvation Congress to Zhang to Zou to read. After Zou finished reading it, he said again, "The content of this telegram clearly said to ask him to send troops to resist Japan, not to ask him to carry out a military谏, and the National Salvation Congress often sent the same telegram to the National Government and Chuan Han Song. Why doesn't the prosecutor take a closer look?" (The inspector stood up and spoke again) "Because the telegram you gave to Zhang Xueliang caused the incident, while the telegrams to the National Government and Song Han did not cause the incident. (A): "Please explain what is the causal relationship between援綏 and the Xi'an Incident in the telegram." (The prosecutor was silent) Zou finally proposed a book of recent works, "Looking Ahead", and asked the prosecutor to study it. The sixth and seventh interrogations of Sha Qianli and Shi Liang, the questions and answers were roughly the same as Shen 鈞儒, but the defendants' attitudes were very激昂. Later, Luo Qing, Gu Liusheng, and Ren Songgao were also interrogated. After the interrogation, lawyer Tang Hao stood up and said, "In the indictment, Gu and Ren were holding leaflets endangering the Republic of China, please show them to the prosecutor." The prosecutor opened the file and only took out the National Salvation Congress' notification of willingness, which was submitted to the court one month after the defendant was arrested. At this point, all the lawyers stood up and protested to the prosecutor. Also, regarding the evidence of Zhang Xueliang, the prosecutor declared that he did not want to investigate, and all the lawyers stood up to protest. The friction was very intense. At this time, Zhang Naiqi spoke, "The prosecutor himself does not investigate the evidence and prevents the judge from investigating the evidence, which is wrong. The prosecutor just said that he represents the country in exercising his powers, which is correct, but we hope that the person who represents the Republic of China will speak with dignity and not make the people lose face." During this period, the lawyer also questioned the prosecutor, "Shaanxi and Suiyuan are connected to each other, but the prosecutor just said that they are far away and there is no need to assist them, which is too ignorant of geography." Wang Zaoshi and Shen 釣儒 both requested to speak, but were prohibited by the judge. It was already 5:30. The court adjourned for deliberation. After 6 o'clock, the judge appeared in court and announced that the file would be investigated by the Military Committee regarding Zhang Xueliang's affairs. Other evidence need not be investigated. Although the lawyers repeatedly requested the investigation of evidence from Ma Xiangbo, Song Zheyuan, Han Fuqu, Chuan Zuoyi, etc., they were still rejected. They adjourned the court immediately.

### Zhao Pilian Returns to Nanjing to Discuss the Consolidation of National Defense on the Suiyuan Front Line

Mongolian and Suiyuan National Elections May Be Held as Scheduled

[Nanjing] Zhao Pilian had been away from Nanjing for three months. He left Ping on the 19th and arrived in Nanjing on the 25th. Zhao said that the two provinces of Jin and Sui had been unusually peaceful for half a year since the victory over the bandits last winter. Military and political circles are full of vigor, and the general public is especially excited. Currently, the national troops are closely deployed on the front line of the Sui border, and the bandits and puppets dare not invade. National defense is very solid in spirit and armament, which is gratifying to the whole country. The election of representatives from various Mongolian regions is being carried out according to the election procedures. The preliminary election has been completed. The representatives of the various leagues and banners under the jurisdiction of the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Council can hold the second election as scheduled next month. The representatives of various regions under special circumstances can also be produced as scheduled in accordance with legal procedures. Vice Chairman Ge has recently been overworked in handling military and political affairs, resulting in a recurrence of old illnesses. According to German doctors, it is chronic enteritis, and all other symptoms are caused by this. After a long period of recuperation, he should be able to recover. Japanese person He Xinji once went to Bing, but Ge did not meet him because he was ill. Since the suppression of bandits in Jin Province the year before last, the people have gradually been able to live and work in peace after actively handling post-disaster relief. However, twenty counties in southern Jin have not rained for several months this year, and the drought is severe. Relief is urgently needed. It is heard that the central government intends to allocate funds to cooperate with the province in providing relief to benefit the victims. (Central News Agency, 25th)

### Germany and Italy Withdraw from the Surveillance Plan and British Diplomacy

— Fu

The Spanish rebel army captured Bilbao, and then Germany and Italy withdrew from the naval surveillance plan, as if there was a connection between the two. The reason for Germany and Italy's withdrawal from the naval surveillance plan, according to the statements issued by the German and Italian governments, is that the German warship "Leipzig" was attacked by two submarines of the Spanish government forces on the 19th. Although it was not hit, the fact is obvious. Therefore, in accordance with the four-nation agreement reached by Britain, France, Germany, and Italy on the 12th, they proposed to the British and French governments to take joint action and send warships to the ports belonging to the Spanish government for a joint demonstration. However, the British government advocated first investigating the truth and then discussing countermeasures. Before the truth was clarified, it rejected the German proposal. As a result, Germany believed that the related and consistent relationship in the four-nation agreement had been damaged and immediately announced its withdrawal from the naval surveillance plan. Italy then adopted a consistent attitude with Germany and took joint action. Thus, only Britain and France remained as countries responsible for naval surveillance work.

Germany and Italy's actions, observed from their own statements, seem to be justified. However, if we study the actual situation, we can immediately discover that their actions are a kind of most vicious application of diplomatic tactics. Their purpose is to win over Britain to jointly destroy the fighting power of the Spanish government forces.

To explain the truth of this diplomatic tactic, we must start with the bombing of the German warship "Deutschland." At the end of last month, Spanish government aircraft bombed the "Deutschland" because it was subjected to its artillery fire, killing more than 20 German sailors. A few days later, several German warships, under the pretext of retaliation, suddenly shelled the port of Almería, which belongs to the Spanish government. This illegal action once aroused international outrage. However, Germany was not satisfied with this and further threatened to withdraw from the international surveillance plan. At this time, Britain was also not very satisfied with the Spanish government's attitude. Therefore, it took the opportunity to expand its power under the name of mediation and signed a four-nation agreement with Germany, Italy, and France, requiring the Spanish government to do its best to protect the naval vessels of various countries engaged in surveillance work and to expand the safety zone. At the same time, it was also agreed that if warships of any of the four countries were attacked by the Spanish government, they must consult each other and take joint action. The attacked warship still retains the right to self-defense. The conclusion of this agreement was, of course, a victory for Fascist diplomacy, and it was extremely unfavorable to the position of the Spanish government forces.

Germany baited the hook for Britain. When Bilbao fell, it manufactured the "Leipzig" incident, demanding that the British and French governments take joint action in accordance with the four-nation agreement and send warships to the ports belonging to the Spanish government for a joint demonstration. This joint demonstration is actually equivalent to sealing off the ports of the Spanish government forces or attacking the artillery positions of the Spanish government's seaports, because if it is not so, the effectiveness of the joint demonstration is very small. If this plan is implemented, the Spanish government will be greatly hit, and Fascist diplomatic tactics can be fully realized.

However, British diplomats have always been known for their cunning. At this critical juncture, they immediately saw through Germany and Italy's vicious methods. Therefore, they advocated first investigating the truth and then discussing countermeasures. However, Germany refused to investigate, while the Spanish government expressed its willingness to facilitate the investigation. This made Britain see Germany's ambition more clearly and immediately rejected Germany's joint demonstration proposal, causing Germany's plan to fail. Seeing that their plan failed, Germany and Italy announced their withdrawal from the naval surveillance plan and prepared to further intervene in the Spanish Civil War.

After Germany and Italy withdrew from the surveillance plan, the future of the non-intervention plan will of course be even more pessimistic. However, the non-intervention plan was not a very thorough method in the first place. Its establishment was mostly due to Britain's ambiguous attitude. This time, Germany's action was also the result of Britain's wavering policy. If we hope that the Spanish Civil War can end soon and the European political situation can be clarified soon, then the British people must first demand that their government adopt a firm policy to maintain justice.

### Ambassador Kawagoe Departs Japan for Shanghai, Saying China and Japan Should Understand Each Other

Advocates Maintaining the Status Quo in North China; Plans to Stay Briefly at Lushan After Returning to His Post

[Tokyo] Japanese Ambassador to China Shigeru Kawagoe boarded the Asama Maru this afternoon and departed from Yokohama for China to return to his post. My country's Chargé d'Affaires in Japan, Yang Yunzhu, personally went to the pier to see him off. Ambassador Kawagoe did not bring his family with him this time and plans to stay in Nanjing and Shanghai until around July 10, after which he will go to Pingjin for inspection. Before Ambassador Kawagoe set off to return to his post, he met with Ishii, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kogu, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, and Toyota, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy, yesterday to exchange final opinions on China policy. Last night, Ambassador Kawagoe met with reporters and made a statement, saying, "I think the saying that we should re-recognize China is enough to cause various misunderstandings. According to my intention, new recognition should be given at all times to countries that are in the process of strengthening and developing, so as to avoid the danger of making wrong decisions. Japan has now given China a new recognition. I will request that China now re-recognize Japan as Japan has done. What is called recognizing Japan is to recognize Japan's right to survival and development, as well as the inevitable connection between 'Manchukuo' and North China. North China exists to adapt to the inevitable destiny of 'Manchukuo's' survival and development. Regarding the issue of economic cooperation, the Nanjing Central Government does not seem to recognize the local cooperation between North China and Japan and requests Japan to cooperate with the Central Government. On this point, its decision completely depends on the nature of each economic issue. Matters belonging to the central government should naturally be handled through cooperation with the central government. Matters belonging to the local government should still be realized through cooperation with the local government. The stationing of the North China Garrison in that area is stipulated in the 1901 treaty and should not be abolished. The Tanggu and He-Umezu Agreements should not be abandoned either. Adjustments to trade, aviation, and customs systems are necessary. Stern measures will be taken to crack down on the operation of drug trafficking. The flight of Hua-owned Japanese aircraft has already been realized, so no matter how the Nanjing government argues, it will not help. If China requests it, Sino-Japanese negotiations can be held at any time, but we do not expect to solve everything in the near future and would rather open a path that turns in a better direction at this time." (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Tokyo] Ambassador to China Shigeru Kawagoe returned to his post by the postal ship Asama Maru at noon on the 25th from Yokohama. Before his departure, he made a statement at his home, saying that after arriving in Shanghai, he plans to meet with Ambassador Xu Shiying, but this is a matter of etiquette and not a special matter for negotiation. After staying in Shanghai for two days, he will enter Nanjing, but the matter of meeting with Minister Wang Chonghui has not yet been decided. After arriving in Beijing, he will go to North China again, but this also has no significant meaning. Key figures in the Chinese government mostly live in Lushan, and I have also rented a house in Lushan, so it is not known whether I will go to Lushan in the future. The recent remarks reported by Foreign Minister Wang seem to be Wang's expression of the Chinese government's policy toward Japan based on the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session. Regarding the economic issues in North China, the Chinese government advocates that the Japanese government should not negotiate with the Hebei-Chahar Political Council but should take the central government as the negotiating partner. However, Japan has always proceeded with the policy of implementing economic cooperation with the local governments of North China. According to my opinion, if the people of North China benefit from economic cooperation, then the Chinese government seems to have no reason to stop this matter. The adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations should not only be resolved through political negotiations between the two governments, but also improve the atmosphere between the two countries first and deepen mutual understanding, which is extremely important. Regarding future Sino-Japanese relations, there is no need to have pessimistic feelings. (25th Dōmei News Agency Dispatch)

### Japan's First Ambassador to China, Akira Ariyoshi, Passed Away Yesterday Morning

First to Propose Recognizing New China; Died Suddenly After Falling in the Bathroom

[Tokyo] Japan's first ambassador to China, Akira Ariyoshi, suddenly had a severe attack of gastric ulcer this morning and died at 7:30 AM at the age of 61. He is survived by one son, who is currently studying at the Imperial University. His wife passed away about two months ago, and his private residence was destroyed by fire shortly thereafter. His experience can be described as tragic. After the news of Ariyoshi's death spread, diplomatic circles in China and Japanese people here expressed deep condolences. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Tokyo] Akira Ariyoshi's remains are scheduled to hold a Buddhist funeral at Aoyama from 10:00 AM to 12:00 noon on the 27th. (25th Dōmei News Agency Dispatch)

[Tokyo] Former Ambassador to China Akira Ariyoshi suddenly collapsed in the bathroom while bathing at his home at 7:00 AM on the 25th and passed away at 7:30 AM. He was appointed as the ambassador to Brazil. In July of the seventh year of Showa, when Sino-Japanese relations fell into a difficult situation due to the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents, he was appointed as the Minister to China and entered the stage of Sino-Japanese diplomacy. With his silent efforts, he reconciled the feelings of China and Japan, which led to the name of "water bird diplomacy." In the tenth year of Showa, because China and Japan exchanged ambassadors, he took office as the first ambassador to China. During his tenure, various problems occurred in North China. The ambassador was able to endure hardship and diligently avoid friction between China and Japan, and he was quite relied on by the Chinese side. When he stepped down and returned to China in February last year, he resolutely said, "We should recognize the national character of a country, just like recognizing the personality of a person. Mr. Ariyoshi's words are the precursor to what is now called a new understanding of China by all parties. After the ambassador returned to China, he contributed to various news magazines and expressed his insightful views on Chinese issues. It is a pity that he passed away suddenly today.

### Anglo-Japanese Negotiations Respect Chinese Interests

British Foreign Secretary Makes Another Statement in the House of Commons; Pushes for the Realization of the Pacific Pact

[London] The British House of Commons held a meeting this morning to debate foreign policy. Sir John Simon, leader of the Liberal Party, repeatedly raised the issue of China, Japan, and Spain, followed by a brief speech by Prime Minister Chamberlain. Simon began his speech by saying that restoring the old friendship between Britain and Japan under honorable conditions would be warmly welcomed by the general public. However, he did not believe in supporting the methods published in the Japanese newspapers, namely that Britain recognizes the status of Manchuria and Japan's special interests in North China, and that Japan recognizes Britain's sphere of influence in return. The method of the Anglo-Japanese alliance cannot be exclusive, nor can it sacrifice Chinese interests, nor can it involve denying the League of Nations' resolution on Manchuria, but Japan should recognize the legitimacy of the demands regarding improved markets and raw materials mentioned by Japan. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that in his opinion, the overall international situation in the Far East now has clear and encouraging signs of progress. The British government has held talks with representatives of the Japanese government, and there is a possibility between the two countries of obtaining a better understanding and enhancing all aspects of each other's relationship. The progress of this conversation gives us hope, and we will be able to continue to make progress after we have made more concrete exchanges of views. The Foreign Secretary then informed the House of Commons that he expected that a review of concrete proposals could begin shortly, continuing the aforementioned Anglo-Japanese talks. Some quarters are worried that an Anglo-Japanese understanding will be established at the expense of Chinese interests. I now wish to reiterate the assurances I have given before, that the British government is determined not to have such behavior. The Foreign Secretary continued, saying that the relationship between Britain and the Chinese government is extremely good, and said that in the future, we will hope and strive to increase friendship and mutual trust between countries in the Far East. We also firmly believe that an understanding with Japan, under certain conditions, can indeed promote that kind of purpose. Regarding the issue of the Pacific Pact, Mr. Eden pointed out that the purpose of the Australian Prime Minister Lyons, who first proposed it, was to request consideration of whether such a method is possible and how to implement it, and there was no argument for a detailed plan. At that time, the Imperial Conference unanimously recognized this kind of agreement as a necessary goal and had considered the various possibilities and difficulties of the various countries in detail, but this matter must be approached through subtle means. It would be unwise to proceed with negotiations before the understanding of the governments of certain countries is quite certain. Eden later added, "We hope to begin seeking opinions from the main parties concerned soon, and then decide whether to put forward concrete suggestions and hope for their success."

### Britain Clarifies Stance on the Spanish Issue

Efforts to Prevent the Spread of the Spanish Conflict; Britain and France Negotiate to Maintain the Surveillance System; German Warship Movements Said to Be Intended for Escort

[London] The House of Commons debated foreign policy today. Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech touched on the Spanish incident, saying that the overall situation in Spain has strange characteristics, which make it present a particularly dangerous atmosphere. In the eyes of many outsiders, the Spanish war itself is a war between two opposing systems, each system gaining enthusiastic support from its comrades within each other's borders. The result is that the supporters of these two opposing systems are powerless to determine which side wins or loses in the Spanish war. This is a long-standing danger. If any country or government is enticed to intervene and crosses a certain point, then it will be clearly difficult, if not impossible, for other countries to stay out of it. If this is the case, it will inevitably lead to a war, and no one dares to predict what the outcome will be. The British government's policy is solely to limit the war to Spain, thereby maintaining peace in Europe. Although there have been interventions after the non-intervention agreement was established, the British government has so far succeeded in achieving the purpose of its policy. Among the various countries, some want this side to win the Spanish war, and some want the other side to win, but no country wants to see a major European war break out. We should maintain a calm mind, not make careless remarks, and not take reckless actions to promote a catastrophe. Regarding the case of the "Leipzig" warship, Germany's claim that it could no longer allow its warships to encounter danger is quite in line with popular sentiment. When considering the German Navy's encounter and the natural resentment caused by the "Deutschland" case, the German government's withdrawal of its warships and its view that the "Leipzig" case has ended, it is felt that the German government has shown its patience. This is what we should acknowledge. Now that the Italian and German warships have withdrawn from the Spanish sea, there will be no danger of such cases occurring on subsequent ships. The most appropriate thing we can do today is: ❶ To fill the gaps caused by the withdrawal of Italian and German patrol ships, ❷ To renew efforts to seek the withdrawal of foreign volunteers from Spain. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 25th)

[Rome] It is reported that the United States is also willing to support the prudent policies pursued by Britain and France on the Spanish issue, so that Germany can understand the importance of the responsibilities it bears. Italian political figures are very concerned about this news and said that although Italy does not intend to take serious measures at present, it still recognizes that it has a related and consistent relationship with Germany. (Central News Agency, Havas, 24th)

[Paris] After Germany and Italy withdrew from the Spanish naval surveillance plan, French Foreign Minister Delbos and British Foreign Secretary Eden have been constantly negotiating to maintain the naval surveillance plan so that it can continue to be implemented. According to news from the French responsible authorities, France has suggested to Britain that the area previously under the surveillance of the German and Italian navies should be monitored by the British and French navies, and it also advocates sending neutral observers to board British and French warships so that the surveillance plan can obtain the greatest guarantee. The responsible authorities also believe that after Germany and Italy withdraw from the surveillance plan, if a unilateral surveillance method is still implemented in the waters under the jurisdiction of the Spanish Republican government, it is tantamount to counteracting it, which is contrary to international law, and the countries along the Mediterranean coast, especially Britain and France, cannot accept it.

### Zhang Zizhong Goes to Leling to Visit Song

Shen Ke Accompanies Zhang to Dispel Outside Rumors, Longyan Mine to Resume Operations

Tianjin Correspondence: Song Zheyuan returned to his native Leling on May 11th, nearing his 50th birthday. Although Hebei-Chahar and Tianjin affairs are being handled by someone, without any interruption, the lack of the leader's return has led to numerous rumors. Among them, the rumors between Song and Tianjin Mayor Zhang Zizhong are particularly numerous. At the beginning of the month, there was even a rumor that Zhang (Zizhong) would resign and Zhao (Dengyu) would succeed him. On the 20th of this month, Shen Ke, commander of the 106th Division, visited Song in Leling out of fraternal relations with the Northwest Army. On the 22nd, he returned to Tianjin to convey Song's opinions to Zhang Zizhong. At 11:00 AM on the 23rd, Zhang and Shen together took the Jinpu Railway express southward. Before leaving, to avoid outside attention, they announced that they were going to Machang Jinghai to inspect the army. Shen then went to Kaifeng. However, according to reports obtained here in the evening, at 2:30 PM on the 23rd, Zhang and Shen changed to cars from Cangzhou to Leling. Zhang met with Song in Tianjin on April 24th, then went abroad to Japan for inspection, and had not met Song since his return, a total of two months. This trip should dispel all outside rumors.

Regarding the economic development issue between China and Japan in North China, the central government's intention is that if political issues are not resolved, it would be inconvenient to discuss anything. In particular, the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway and the Longyan Iron Mine are related to national plans and cannot be promised without authorization. It is heard that the construction of the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway seems to have temporarily cooled down, while the restoration of the Longyan Mine has entered the stage of realization. The other day, President Sogawa of Japan and China Company contacted Li Sihao and Lu Zongyu in Pingjin, and exchanged views with Ikeda, a staff officer of the Japanese Army stationed in North China. It is almost completely decided that the issue of "joint operation and loan" which was the focus of dispute between the two parties in the past has been resolved recently. That is, the joint Sino-Japanese investment limited liability company system is adopted, with a capital of 14 million yuan. In addition to the existing property of Longyan valued at 4 million yuan, another 10 million yuan will be raised. China will bear 3 million yuan in cash, and the Japanese side will bear 7 million yuan. China lacks cash and will borrow from the Xingzhong Company at interest. If the Xingzhong Company has no funds, it will be assisted by the Japanese Toyo Colonization Company. The other day, Japan spread the word that Toyo Colonization and Xingzhong would divide their boundaries and invest in North China. Xingzhong will borrow from Toyo Colonization, which refers to this. Sogawa went to Dalian on the 22nd, met with Matsuoka, President of Mantetsu, and then returned to Japan to contact Toyo Colonization Company. He will return to Tianjin around mid-July. At that time, the mining of the Longyan Mine will become more active. Last week, the steel mill of the Tangshan Mine in western Pingxi transported a large amount of brick and tile materials to repair everything. The railway from Longguan to the Yantongshan Mine will be transported to the materials at the end of the month to facilitate repairs. (June 23rd)

### After the Revision of the Guangdong Monetary System, the Finance Department Convenes a Financial Conference

Key Members of the Provincial Financial Community Attend, Department Director Explains Matters Requiring Attention

Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the Ministry of Finance issued an order stipulating the ratio between mill notes and legal tender, the province's currency has been unified, and the financial situation has become stable. Finance Department Director Zeng Yangfu, in order to promote the completion of the central government's unified currency policy and consolidate the financial market, specially convened representatives from the Banking Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Commercial Federation, and the Silver Industry Association at the Finance Department at 4:30 PM on the 20th to discuss matters. Those present included Department Director Zeng Yangfu, presidents of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Provincial Bank Zhong E, Chen Yuqian, Wen Wanqing, Shen Jing, Gu Yiqun, Banking Association representatives Wu Kejia, Zhao Pushan, Dao Zhongtao, Lu Yanming, Silver Industry Association representatives Chen Weiwen, Liu Junzhu, Guo Zhuohua, Municipal Chamber of Commerce representatives Zou Dianbang, Mao Shaoqing, He Shaohai, Liu Chenglong, Liang Peiji, Hu Songtang, Feng Taolu, Huang Zhongda, Zhi Ziqing, Provincial Commercial Federation He Jiping, and Finance Department Financial Affairs Special Office Director and Secretary Gui Jingqiu, Dong Zhongding, Advisor Huang Yinpu, and many others. Chairman and Department Director Zeng first put forward opinions and methods, saying in essence, "The purpose of the province's conversion to silver dollars is to support the country's unified monetary system and stabilize the province's financial situation. The key lies in recovering mill notes in the shortest possible time and allowing national currency to circulate in the province. To achieve this goal, the following regulations must be observed: ㊀ From August 1st, all banks and from September 1st, all silver shops must pay all deposit and remittance items in national currency and can no longer pay in mill notes or foreign currency. ㊁ Although mill notes can still circulate at the legal price of 144 within this year, no difference in price is allowed. In addition to exchanging legal tender from the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Provincial Bank, they are not allowed to engage in any other currency exchange transactions. ㊂ Various prices should be changed to silver dollars at a ratio of 144 and should not be increased, which would affect people's lives. ㊃ It is hoped that the commissioners of the provincial and municipal chambers of commerce and the banking and silver industry associations will do their utmost to persuade their respective industries and merchants to respect government orders and strive to implement them." He also explained in detail the reasons and implementation steps of the above methods, in order to promote construction, increase production, prosper the economy, and improve people's lives. All those present spoke successively, believing that the central government's revision of the province's monetary system policy, the financial department's regulations, and the supplementary items proposed by Director Zeng were in accordance with the situation and were extremely satisfactory. Everyone was willing to abide by the government's orders and promote the great cause of a unified monetary system. The meeting did not end until six o'clock.

### Fuzhou Suffers Five Floods

The Most Recent Flood Was the Largest, Construction Department is Preparing a Flood Control Plan

Fuzhou Correspondence: Since late May, the upper reaches of the Min River, Nanping, Jian'ou, Jianyang, Shaowu, Shaxian, Yong'an, Mingxi, and Qingliu counties, have experienced continuous heavy rain, causing the Dongxi (in Shaowu) and Xixi (in Mingxi) rivers, which are the sources of the Min River, to swell simultaneously. The Dongxi flows down from Jian'ou, and the Xixi flows down from Shaxian, merging at Nanping and surging downwards. Fuzhou, located in the upper reaches of its confluence with the sea, has suffered greatly. From May 29th to June 19th, within two weeks, it has been hit by five floods in a row, especially the most recent one (June 18, 19, 20, and 3 days), which was the largest. Except for a corner of the northern city, the three cities of the east, west, and south were submerged in water. In low-lying areas, the water reached the roofs of houses. The countryside was a vast expanse of water, becoming a huge immersion. On the 18th, the water gradually increased. On the 19th, the water was at its highest. More than three-quarters of the city could be navigated by boats. On the 20th, the weather cleared and the water began to recede. At the height of the flood, party and government organs and charitable organizations organized relief teams and used boats to transport food to the disaster areas for relief. In recent days, the Minhou County Government, according to reports from the chiefs of the first district (outside the South Gate), the second district (outside the East Gate), the third district (outside the South Gate), and the fourth district (outside the West Gate), has stated that the loss of fields, crops, and seasonal fruits due to the water in each district is more than 300,000 yuan. They have requested that the county government send personnel to investigate and request relief from the county and provincial governments. According to a certain engineer from the Water Conservancy Engineering Office, "The reasons for the large flood in Fuzhou this time are: ㊀ The upper reaches of the various counties are discharging large amounts of water, ㊁ It happened to coincide with high tide and tsunami, but the fundamental reason is the silting of the commercial port in the provincial capital. In the previous major flood, the Construction Department planned to dredge the South Port to reduce the flood in the North Port, but the plan was stopped due to opposition from the villagers. Recently, the waterway in the South Port and the Hongtang area have become increasingly silted up, resulting in this major flood, which is even more severe than the previous year. In recent days, personnel from the Water Conservancy Office of the Construction Department and the Works Department of the Provincial Capital have drafted a flood control plan for the provincial capital based on the results of water measurement. The main points of the plan are as follows: ㊀ Implement dredging works in the South Port as soon as possible. ㊁ Build high dikes from Huaian in the west gate to Wanbian in the south gate to prevent the water from the South Port from backflowing into the North Port. ㊂ Rebuild the Jiangnan Bridge, dismantle the original stone bridge, and build a one-hole iron bridge. ㊃ Open a new canal from Sihe through Chating to Datiegang. ㊄ Raise the Chating Road and build more water diversion bridges and culverts. ㊅ Continue to dredge the various sections of the river. It is also heard that due to traffic considerations, it is planned to widen the roadway of the Wanshou Bridge in Taijiang and add sidewalks, and to change the rebuilt Jiangnan Bridge into a two-story bridge, so that vehicles can go directly to Cangqian Mountain from the upper level of the bridge, reducing the congestion in Guanyin Well. However, the entire project cannot be completed without 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. If it is to be completed in two or three years, it must be borne by the entire city of the provincial capital and the beneficiaries of the fields. The entire plan has now been completed and will be submitted to the Construction Department for approval by the Provincial Government for review of the funding methods. It is also planned to build several reservoirs in the various small streams in the upper reaches of the Min River, and the funds will be allocated from the Minbei Water Conservancy Fund. (June 23rd)

Counterfeit Serial Tickets for Tax Collection

Zou Shun, a collection policeman hired by the Wuyi County Government, had been serving for many years and was still considered competent.

The matter was learned by Xie Yingfu, the chief of the eighth district, who rushed to arrest the policeman and searched out the forged serial tickets.

### City Scouts Mobilized for Disaster Victims Yesterday and Raised Funds in the Rain

Continuing Today to Solicit Donations on Various Roads, Hoping All Sectors Will Generously Donate to Relieve the Disaster Victims

The city's charitable organizations' joint disaster relief association, for the severe drought victims in Sichuan, Guizhou, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Shanxi provinces who are crying out for food, although the government and all sectors have allocated funds for relief, the disaster area is too extensive to cover everyone. They have specifically requested the city's scout council to order the city's scouts to go to various locations in the International Settlement for fundraising for two days, yesterday and today. Although there was heavy rain yesterday morning, the scouts still proceeded in the rain. The details are recorded as follows:

Notice from the Association

The association specifically issued a notice saying, "This year, the drought in Henan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Shanxi provinces is exceptionally severe, with tens of millions of disaster victims and thousands of miles of barren land. The tragic situation has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers, which is presumably known to all sectors of society. Our association is coordinating relief efforts and doing our best to appeal. We are grateful that the central government has issued disaster relief funds and that enthusiastic people have generously donated. We have already distributed the funds to the disaster-stricken provinces for relief. However, the disaster area is too extensive, and it is difficult to provide thorough relief. We have repeatedly received letters and telegrams from various provinces stating that hundreds of millions of disaster victims are on the verge of death. Unless continued relief is provided, they will all perish in ditches. We have decided to ask the city's entire scout force to mobilize on the 25th and 26th of this month to collect donations in the International Settlement to provide relief. We hope that people from all walks of life will generously donate, no matter how much or how little, donate according to your ability. Donating even one more cent will save one more life. We respectfully request your consideration on behalf of the disaster victims in various provinces."

Fundraising in the Rain

The scout council accepted the request from the charitable organizations' joint association and immediately ordered the entire scout force to mobilize on the 25th and 26th to conduct fundraising on various roads in the International Settlement. They also established a temporary office within the charitable disaster relief association to facilitate command. Yesterday morning, the weather was not favorable, and it rained heavily. The scouts all rushed to report and receive donation booklets, and they automatically divided into groups of several people each to go to various roads in the International Settlement to raise funds in the rain. However, due to the torrential rain in the morning, there were few pedestrians. It was not until the weather cleared up in the afternoon that the scouts actively proceeded. This spirit is admirable, and we hope that people from all walks of life will generously donate to support this righteous cause.

Appeal for Help

The Shanghai Charitable Organizations' Joint Disaster Relief Association is appealing for help for the drought victims in Sichuan, Guizhou, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Shanxi provinces, and requests people from all walks of life to generously donate. They have specially published a fundraising appeal: (1) One yuan saves one life. Donating one more yuan saves one more life. (2) Please save on unnecessary consumption and donate to disaster relief to create blessings for future generations. (3) Relieving disaster victims is cultivating national strength. (4) Disaster relief and national salvation are equally important. (5) Please have mercy on the suffering of the disaster victims and unite to help them. (6) Now that we are in a position to save people, wouldn't that be a great blessing? (7) Everyone, save on food and clothing to save our compatriots in Sichuan, Guizhou, Gansu, Henan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces. (8) We have plenty of food and warm clothes, we should think of the disaster victims who have no food or clothing, enduring hunger and starvation. (9) The disaster victims who have no food are eating leaves, grass roots, and fruit. (10) Disaster victims are filling their stomachs with stones, causing abdominal distension and death, which is truly pitiful. (11) Hundreds of millions of disaster victims are on the verge of death. (12) Disaster victims are selling their wives and children everywhere. A small child is worth only one yuan, how pitiful!

### Silk Weavers in Various Districts Continued to Petition the Municipal Party Headquarters Yesterday

Satisfactory Result, Labor Strife Expected to Be Resolved, Most Workers at Mei Ya and Jingwei Factories Resume Work

According to Da Gong She, the labor strife in the city's silk weaving industry has been prolonged and unresolved. A few days ago, constitutional agencies sent personnel to the Hongkou area to persuade the workers to resume work, but the workers insisted that the detained workers must be released before they would agree to resume work, so it was not resolved. At 10 a.m. yesterday, silk weavers from the Hongkou and Zhabei districts sent representatives to the Municipal Party Headquarters to petition again. The result was quite satisfactory, so the labor strife is expected to be resolved. The details are recorded as follows:

Workers from Various Factories Petition the Party Headquarters

Since the city's silk weaving labor strife was once resolved through party and government mediation, it was revived by agitation by radical elements, and now most of the forty-odd silk weaving factories in the Hongkou district have gone on strike, and a part of the Zhabei special district has also gone on strike. After the party and government agencies sent personnel to Hongkou to persuade the workers a few days ago, because some workers insisted that the detained workers, Wang Hao and others, must be released, there was no result. At 10 a.m. yesterday, the silk weavers of the Hongkou district sent Chen Rusheng and Ding Zuiyuan from the Mei Ya No. 4 Factory, Xu Jian and Huang Chengyun from the Jinsheng Factory, and Wu Ziyu from the Meiwen Factory, while the Hongkou district sent Dong Chenggao and others from the Jinsheng Factory as representatives to petition at the Municipal Party Headquarters in Fenglinqiao. They were received by Zhang Sheng, director of the Labor and Peasants Department. However, the workers still demanded the release of Wang Hao, secretary of the silk weaving trade union in the three districts, and it was said that work would resume immediately. Mr. Zhang explained to the representatives that (1) workers dismissed from various factories, except for those who had already been approved for dismissal by the party and government, could return to work in the factory; (2) the demand to release the detained workers must wait until the entire labor strife is resolved, and the workers who are not involved in the case will be released and allowed to work in the factory. The worker representatives were satisfied and agreed to go back and persuade the workers in various factories to resume work quickly, so the labor strife is expected to be resolved soon.

Most Workers at Mei Ya and Jingwei Factories Resume Work

After the party and government agencies jointly issued a notice to the Mei Ya Jingwei Factory and the main factory on Rihui East Road in the Hongkou area, ordering them to resume work by 6 p.m. on the 19th of this month, the factory has complied with the order and started work, and most workers have also returned to work. However, there are still bad workers who are intimidating and obstructing them outside, so many workers are still afraid to return to the factory. The situation has improved in the past two days. More than 400 workers have resumed work at the Jingwei Factory, and more than 300 at the main factory. The factory has submitted a request to the party and government agencies to allow the arrest and prosecution of bad workers outside the factory who are obstructing work, and it is said that the party and government have agreed.

### Labor Strife at Shanghai Brewery in Stalemate

The Factory Insists That It Is Difficult to Resolve, All Workers Make a Major Petition

The labor strife at the Shanghai Brewery, a British-owned factory in the Hongkou area, remained in a stalemate yesterday. The 93 new workers hired by the factory (including 30 White Russians, 24 male workers, and 39 female workers) were able to enter the factory to work at 8 a.m. yesterday under the protection of a large number of detectives from the police station. However, most of these workers were not familiar with the work, so they all left the factory after 11 a.m. At 2 p.m., except for a part who voluntarily gave up and did not go to work, there were still more than 60 people who went to the factory, and they left the factory at 4 p.m. Before the new workers entered the factory, all the old workers, upon learning of the situation, gathered in the Hongkou area at about 10 a.m. to hold an emergency meeting. They all advocated using force to prevent the new workers from entering the factory to work. After the chairman repeatedly persuaded them, saying that they should wait for the party and government agencies to mediate and not expand the matter excessively to avoid incidents and to maintain order in accordance with government orders, they did not cause trouble. After the meeting, they still sent Xu Xueqing and two other representatives to the Sixth District Party Headquarters to meet with Pan Guoren, requesting immediate assistance to stop the new workers from entering the factory to maintain the status of the old workers. Mr. Pan advised the workers not to take actions outside the established channels. The Party Headquarters also paid special attention to the labor strife and is now sending Cao Peizhi to negotiate with the factory based on reason, waiting for a resolution. According to a reporter from the Huadong News Agency, the labor strife at the factory is due to the factory's rejection of all eight conditions proposed by the workers, and its attitude is firm, so it is not easy to resolve at the moment.

### Real Estate Association Investigates Water Supply Situation

Inquires about the actual situation from members, requesting replies within a week

The Real Estate Association of this city sent letters to its members yesterday stating: "We are writing to you regarding a letter from the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, stating that the Shanghai Municipal Council's collection of patrol fees should exclude water fees for households whose water is supplied by landlords, as previously announced by the Municipal Council. However, in reality, most households in the concession have their water supplied by landlords, and residents are unaware of the regulations and often include water fees in their rent, resulting in significant invisible losses. Our association wishes to understand the water fee situation for residents in the concession and is specifically inquiring with your association. If you could kindly provide a list of the water supply arrangements and whether the water fees are excluded from the rent when residents pay their taxes, it would be greatly appreciated as a basis for negotiations. Upon investigation, the water supply situation for households in the Public Concession varies, with some supplied by landlords and others paying their own water fees. Therefore, we are specifically inquiring with your association whether water is supplied to residents. If so, is the water fee excluded from the tax calculations? We kindly request that you investigate and reply within one week."

After the committee was established, it established the Central Cotton Production Improvement Institute to oversee the implementation of improvement work and study improvement technologies. Subsequently, cotton production improvement institutes or cotton planting guidance institutes were established in Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, Hubei, Shanxi, Shandong, and other provinces, with twenty affiliated cotton test fields, totaling 10,146 mu of land, and forty guidance areas were established. The work can be divided into three parts: research work, promotion work, and cotton industry economy. (A) Research Work, ㊀ Cotton cultivation and introduction of Si Zi cotton were studied. Each improvement institute and cotton field is responsible for breeding work. In the past three years, the most significant achievement has been the introduction of Si Zi cotton, which is better than the original American cotton and more suitable for the climate of the north, increasing the yield by 35 to 53 catties per mu. ㊁ Research and prevention of cotton pests, especially the method of controlling aphids with tobacco water and cotton oil emulsion, has been very effective. Last year's aphid control in Hebei was very popular among cotton farmers. ㊂ Research and prevention of cotton diseases. ㊃ Research on cotton cultivation chemistry. ㊄ Investigation of national cotton varieties and cotton cultivation methods. ㊅ Breeding of disease-resistant Chinese cotton. (B) Promotion Work: Each province has directly promoted American cotton on a total of more than 2.6 million mu. In Shaanxi Province, after the prohibition of opium cultivation, cotton has become the most profitable crop, and the cotton field area has increased significantly. Before the establishment of the improvement institute, the cotton field in the province was less than 2 million mu, and now the institute directly promotes 1.02 million mu. (C) Cotton Industry Economic Work: A total of over 1,200 cooperatives have been established, with over 70,000 members and nearly 1 million mu of cotton fields. The nature of the cooperatives is divided into production, transportation, sales, and credit. Over the years, it has introduced loans from various banks or syndicates, totaling about 5.9 million yuan, and has established over 20 cotton gins to preserve good seeds and reduce ginning costs. This year, other important works are being carried out, including: ㊀ Conducting large-scale aphid control, designating Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, and Shandong provinces as the main aphid control areas, with a prevention area of 2 million to 5 million mu. Based on last year's experience, each mu can increase revenue by 5 yuan, increasing revenue from 10 million yuan to 25 million yuan. ㊁ Conducting a national cotton production estimate, divided into four categories: cotton production overview investigation, rural cotton production investigation, growth situation investigation, and market investigation. The estimated results will be published three times in August, December, and January. No less than tens of thousands of people at all levels will participate in the investigation and report. ㊂ Increasing the number of cotton seed management areas to centralize management. Currently, three locations have been established at the Henan Improvement Institute, one at the Shaanxi Improvement Institute, and three at the Shanxi Improvement Institute. ㊃ Promoting well drilling. This work has been most successful in Hebei and Henan, with over 1,000 wells drilled in Hebei and over 500 wells drilled in Henan. Currently, all northern provinces are actively promoting this. ㊄ Promoting chemical fertilizers. Currently, it is cooperating with Yongli Chemical Industry Company to promote chemical fertilizers and conduct fertilizer demonstration experiments. In summary, in the past two years, raw cotton production has increased from over 9 million dan to over 14 million dan. In the future, we will work even harder to increase production by 3 million dan each year for five years, which will not only enable the national total output to increase to 20 million dan, but also allow for surpluses to be exported abroad, increasing the country's revenue by tens of millions of yuan each year, which will greatly benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood.

It also mentioned the crackdown on water and adulteration in cotton and grading work, stating that water and adulteration in cotton have been deeply rooted malpractices. Since its establishment, the committee has formulated regulations and implementation rules for cracking down on water and adulteration in cotton to improve cotton quality and enhance international reputation, which were promulgated in July and September 1934, and established the Central Cotton Water and Adulteration Crackdown Institute and provincial crackdown institutes in Henan, Shaanxi, Hunan, Hubei, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangxi, Anhui, and other provinces, as well as the Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Municipality Crackdown Institutes, which were jointly led by the Central Crackdown Institute. Each provincial crackdown institute has district branch offices to handle inspections. Regarding the work situation, ㊀ From the start of operations to November 1936, the number of inspections and spot checks was 742,950.1 dan. The average moisture content at the beginning of operations was over 15%, and the average impurity content was 10%. Since then, they have decreased year by year. In 1936, the average moisture content was 11.04%, a decrease of 4%, and the average impurity content was 1.32%, a decrease of 8%. According to the Hubei Crackdown Institute, previously, it took about 500 pounds of cotton to spin a yarn, but now it takes only about 460 pounds on average. ㊁ 2,691 cases of substandard cotton were processed and handled according to law. ㊂ 18,131 cotton merchants have registered. ㊃ On-site inspections were conducted at factories. Last winter, 110,000 bales were inspected at machine packing factories in Henan and Shaanxi provinces. Regarding the cotton grading work, a grading and inspection department was established within the Central Improvement Institute to formulate cotton grade standards, conduct grading inspections, and train grading personnel.

Li's Report

Briefly stated that improving the cotton textile industry can be divided into three parts: cultivating technical talents, establishing research institutions, and guiding operational technology. (A) Cultivating technical talents. The immaturity of China's textile technology is due to various reasons, and the lack of talent is the main reason. Therefore, in 1934, the textile department of Nantong College, the senior vocational dyeing and weaving department of Hebei Provincial Industrial College, and the dyeing and weaving department of Jiangsu Provincial Suzhou Industrial School were selected and provided with financial assistance to add spinning machines and other equipment to enrich their content and complete their courses to create practical and useful talents. To improve technology, personnel were also sent abroad for research. (B) Establishing research institutions. Textile and dyeing research institutions are indispensable equipment for improving technology and enhancing quality. When the committee was established, it jointly established a textile and dyeing experiment hall with the Academia Sinica, using the latest equipment as a common research institution. It was originally planned to complete the textile, dyeing, and three parts in phases with a budgeted expenditure of 1.2 million yuan. The first phase raised 400,000 yuan to purchase various textile machines and equipment, and to pay for land purchase and construction costs. Three textile factories and test rooms were established, with about 1,000 yarn spindles, about 60 power looms, and over 20 test instruments. The hall is located next to the Institute of Physics and Chemistry of the Academia Sinica in Shanghai, covering an area of about 17 mu. (C) Guiding operational technology. ㊀ Compiling textile reference books and compiling a book on operating standards for cotton textile factories and distributing it to various factories for them to follow. ㊁ Sending personnel to implement guidance to textile and dyeing factories. A total of 17 textile and dyeing factories in Tianjin, Shanghai, Jinan, Jiujiang, Shashi, and other places requested the committee to send personnel to investigate prices, inspect equipment, and draft reorganization or expansion plans, totaling 1,172,261 spindles, 89,736 thread spindles, and 10,391 looms. ㊂ Guiding the improvement of native cloth, first implemented in Nantong County. ㊃ Conducting investigation and statistics. The ones that have been made include the manufacturing status of national cotton textile factories, labor status, statistical data on the number of machine parts, production and sales statistics, and cotton market price surveys. Other important plans, such as applying to the government for funds to subsidize low-interest working capital, such as improving and enriching yarn factory equipment, establishing model yarn factories, establishing textile machinery factories, and completing the equipment for the cotton textile and dyeing experiment hall, are all related to the progress plan of the entire industry. In the future, we deeply hope that political and economic forces can be used to realize them. Then the revival of China's textile industry can be expected soon.

### Economic Hardship Greatly Afflicts The North China Branch Of The Royal Asiatic Society

Founded nearly eighty years ago, the museum makes many contributions to society

The North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society held its annual meeting on Thursday afternoon at the Wu Lien-teh Hall of the Society, presided over by President Su Wei-bi, with a total of fifteen people including the president and staff in attendance. The chairman stated that the association had exhausted all methods in recent years in order to eliminate the bank overdraft of 58,000 yuan. This debt interest is one of the major expenditures of the association each year. Recently, an anonymous person was willing to provide a grant of 10,000 yuan to pay off the association's debts, but stipulated that the association must raise the remaining funds required. Unfortunately, there has been a lack of generous responders. Thus, just before the opening of the meeting, this gentleman canceled his offer. Last year, a total of 24,424 people visited the museum affiliated with this association. The association also holds lectures on a regular basis and is currently discussing various plans to clear debts and raise funds to expand the scope of the association's work. If successful, the future will be long-lasting and prosperous and will benefit the public. Otherwise, the situation will be very difficult. The association will have been established for nearly eighty years and has been the only cultural group in China for a long period of time. More commendably, the association is the oldest cultural group in China with remarkable achievements over the years. I firmly believe that the people of Shanghai and the members will not allow the association to lose its former glory due to a lack of financial assistance. The future of the association even has the hope of being brighter than in the past. I would like to suggest that special efforts should be made to celebrate the association's eightieth anniversary so that the association can be placed on a permanent and solid financial foundation. Subsequently, Honorary Secretary Kersey suggested that the Municipal Council should consider whether to formulate a policy for cultural development in Shanghai, which should include an important part for the Royal Asiatic Society. Then, Honorary Curator of the Museum (Su Wei-bi) reported on the achievements of the Museum, stating that most of the visitors to the museum last year were schoolchildren. This is a gratifying result of the museum's employment of an educational supervisor who is in constant contact with the principals and teachers of various schools in this city and disseminates the educational benefits of the museum. Most of the visitors are students from universities, middle schools, and primary schools, and the number is increasing day by day, which greatly demonstrates the value of the Shanghai Museum and its contribution to public service. In order to facilitate the purchase of various specimens by visitors, the museum has set up a museum store in part of the ground floor to sell bird and animal specimens, as well as various artworks and archaeological items at low prices. After the officers finished their reports, the new officers were elected and the meeting was adjourned, with Su Wei-bi as the president, and Abraham and Wu Lien-teh as the vice presidents.

### Military Weapons Seized On A Smoking Bed

Two Criminals Arrested

Recently, Patrol Officer He Ji of the Hongzhen Substation in Zhabei learned that a gang of bandits had been hiding in House No. 14, Fanjiazhai, Dongshi Shao, Hongzhen, privately storing military weapons and plotting wrongdoing. At about 7:30 PM the day before yesterday, he led the patrol police to search the premises. When the officers arrived, they saw two bandits lying on a bed, puffing away and smoking opium. They were immediately arrested. Then, on the brown canopy of the smoking bed, they found an Eighteenth Model six-inch Browning pistol, six bullets, a magazine, and seventeen pawn tickets, which were all confiscated. The case was transferred to the Linping Road Police Station for strict interrogation. According to the two bandits, ㊀ Fan Jindi, a local, 25 years old, ㊁ Fan Jinbao, a local, 25 years old. Regarding the private storage of military weapons, they initially quibbled, but when the evidence was conclusive, they admitted that the pistol was stored by a person named Xiaogen who lived in Zhangjia Lane. Because the case involves the private storage of military weapons, which is a serious offense, the police sent it to the local court for trial.

### Xu Qianlin's 60th Anniversary of Living in Shanghai

### All Principal Culprits In Robbery And Murder Case In Pudong Have Been Apprehended

Because the location of the crime was in Pudong, the Municipal Police Bureau requested that the three criminals be transferred.

Chen Tingzhang, the owner of Huamei Electrical Material Store on Fuzhou Road, lives at No. 187 Yangjiazhai, Pudong. In 1928, he was kidnapped by bandits. The City Police Bureau arrested one of the kidnappers, Jin Lifu, and handed him over to the local court for sentencing. Now that Jin has been released after serving his sentence, believing that his years of imprisonment were bestowed by Chen, he gathered a gang of accomplices at 2:00 AM on the night of May 4 and went to Chen's house to extort money. Unexpectedly, when Jin and others arrived at Chen's house, another group of bandits also went to Chen's house to rob. Chen's family fired bird guns in resistance, causing the bandits to fire their guns and kill a member of the family. Now, Chinese detectives Yang Chengcai, Wang Jiaju, Pang Rui from the Laozha Gate Patrol Room, and detective Zhu Shanghe, etc., have successively arrested Zhang Pingjiang, Chen Zhenghe, Chi Tiemin, a woman Zhao Juju, Xie Jindi (i.e., one of Jin Lifu's gang), Wang Dian, Wang Amao, Jia Youquan, and Li Jinsheng (i.e., a bandit from the other gang), and other nine people, seized one Mauser pistol, two bullets, and two iron bars, and handed them over to the First Special District Court. After questioning, the court detained them. Wang Dian and others confessed that Xu Yougui, a Jiangbei native who works as a carpenter at the Gaochang Temple and Jiangnan Shipyard, was also an accomplice in the case. The detectives, together with detectives from the City Police Bureau, arrested the suspect Xu and found a wooden fake Mauser pistol at No. 262, Lao Guangdong Street, and together with the nine suspects Zhang Pingjiang and others, they were sent to the First Criminal Division of the Special District Court. Criminal Judge Qian Hongye interrogated them immediately. The Patrol Room lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that the crime committed by the suspects was in Pudong, so today the City Police Bureau sent personnel to the court to request a transfer. However, after investigation by the Patrol Room, Wang Dian, Wang Amao, Jia Youquan, and Li Jinsheng have committed numerous crimes in the concession and are currently under investigation. It should be requested that the transfer be temporarily postponed. Zhang Pingjiang, Chen Zhenghe, and Chi Tiemin have not committed any crimes in the concession. It is requested that they be transferred to the City Police Bureau. The two female suspects Zhao Juju and Xie Jindi have been investigated and found to have no connection with the robbery and murder case in Pudong and should be released. Subsequently, the representative of the City Police Bureau submitted an official letter requesting permission to transfer Zhang Pingjiang and other suspects for interrogation and investigation. After Criminal Judge Qian reported to the superior, he ordered that the cases of Wang Dian, Wang Amao, Jia Youquan, Li Jinsheng, and Xu Yougui be heard at a later date. Zhang Pingjiang, Chen Zhenghe, and Chi Tiemin were allowed to be taken away by the personnel of the Shanghai City Police Bureau for investigation and trial. According to news from the Patrol Room, all the principal culprits in the robbery and murder case of the Chen family in Pudong have been apprehended, so the investigation of the suspects in the case has come to an end.

###洪昌 Silk Factory Owner Accuses Workers of Rioting and Destroying the Entire Factory

After investigation, the prosecutor filed a public prosecution. Few defendants were present and all denied the charges.

Lao Zhennan, owner of the Hongchang Silk Factory at No. 369, Lane 3, Kangnao Road, Caojiadu, West Shanghai, hired lawyer Wu Peng and accused in the local court that at 8 p.m. on May 3, workers Qian Jin’gen, Wang Junming, Jiang Jinsheng, etc., colluded with representatives Qian Bajin, Bu Yinhuai, Xu Yacheng, Zhu Shengtai, Zhang Xiangtang, etc., of the Silk Weaving Industry Union of the Third District of this city, and led thirty to forty members of the union to rush into the factory, claiming to be acting on the order of the Third District Union, and immediately ordered Hongchang workers to stop work, forcibly shut down the motors, and assisted the union in surrounding the Caojiadu Police Station. At that time, the plaintiff was away from the factory due to business. Chen Zufang, from a neighboring factory, came to inquire about the situation and was mistakenly identified as someone interfering, and was severely beaten. They then returned to the union, gathered several hundred people, and repeatedly came to the factory to destroy the machinery, raw materials, and other items. They even rushed to the plaintiff's home, but fortunately, he was not home and avoided being beaten, but the gate was destroyed. They also threatened that the plaintiff must surrender to the union, otherwise the entire factory would be destroyed. Later, because the plaintiff did not go to the union and was deemed disobedient, they gathered a thousand or more people and rushed to the factory again, destroying everything. The location was on an area where roads were being built beyond the concession limits. A Western patrolman immediately notified the Gordon Road Police Station, which sent a large number of Western and Indian policemen to suppress the riot before it dispersed. It is said that Wang Hao instigated the riot, so they requested that Qian Jin’gen, Bu Yinhuai, Zhu Shengtai, Zhang Xiangtang, Qian Bajin, Xing Xiaolin, Lü Zaiyue, Zhao Hongfa, Jiang Jinsheng, Xu Yacheng, Zhang Tianbao, Wang Junming, etc. be prosecuted under Articles 304 and 306 of the Criminal Code for obstructing freedom of speech, Article 354 for destruction, and Article 283 for injury, with an additional claim of 2,930.08 yuan in losses. The prosecutor has clearly investigated and filed a public prosecution on the charge of destruction. Yesterday, Judge Zi Dongling of the court opened the hearing. The plaintiff, accompanied by his agent lawyer Wu Peng, appeared to request legal action. Only Qian Bajin, Lü Zaiyue, and Zhang Tianbao appeared in court and denied the charges. The court summoned police officers such as Lu Yunxiang to testify to the facts. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning, and the defendants were released on bail.

### Wang Xinggao Leaves Shanghai; Shanghai County Resubmits Indictment; Investigation Suspended

Yesterday, only the manager of the Asia Hotel appeared in court. The court is now investigating Chen Yong, who came forward to lease the shop.

Wang Xinggao from Funing was accused of instigating the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World, by Zhao Guangfu, the principal offender who was arrested. The French police arrested Wang and brought him to the Special No. 2 Court for prosecution. The first instance court sentenced Wang Xinggao to life imprisonment for murder, depriving him of his civil rights for life. Wang appealed the verdict. The Third Branch of the High Court reviewed the case, overturned the original verdict, and acquitted him. During the appeal period, he was ordered to pay 20,000 yuan as bail, with the surety to ensure his presence when summoned. Later, the French Police Department refused to accept the acquittal and petitioned the prosecutor of the Third Branch of the High Court to appeal to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court overturned the acquittal verdict of the Second Instance of the First Branch of the High Court and remanded the case to the Third Branch of the High Court for a retrial. However, Wang had already left Shanghai and his whereabouts were unknown. The judgment was delivered to the guarantor for forwarding. The Third Branch of the High Court issued a notice for the court hearing scheduled for yesterday. Wang Xinggao's summons could not be delivered because he was not in Shanghai. Yesterday morning at around 10 a.m., Judge Chen Daqi of the Criminal Court of the Third Branch of the High Court presided over the investigative hearing at the Second Court. Only Sun Jinlang, the manager of the Asia Hotel on Edward Road, reported. He stated that he was 49 years old, from Wuxi, and had been the manager of the Asia Hotel since 1935. The hotel was leased in July 1932. The previous manager was Chen Wenyi from Guangdong, who had since passed away. The lease agreement was signed by Chen Yong, who used to work at the Asia Steamship Ticket Bureau on Xinkaihe Road and also worked as a comprador on a steamship. Due to business failure, this person's whereabouts are now unknown. Asked if the revolving register of the Asia Hotel before you leased it still exists? The answer was, no. Asked if there are any old employees or old waiters still working in your store? The answer now is that only Chuan Qingrong is still working in the store. The court then summoned Detective Wang Rusong, who handled the case at the time, to testify. He was instructed to investigate the whereabouts of Chen Yong and summon Chuan Qingrong to testify. It was announced that the investigation of the case was suspended and a new trial would be scheduled later. The court then adjourned.

### Zhang Yuanfan, Accountant of the Sichuan Cuisine Department of the Former Nanjing Hotel, Assassinated

Five axe wounds to the head, blood flowing freely. The incident occurred in the early morning; the assassin escaped with ease.

Liao Haicheng from Sichuan used to run the Doyichu Sichuan Cuisine Restaurant in this city. Due to poor business, he leased it to others. Later, he contracted the Sichuan Cuisine Department attached to the Nanjing Hotel at No. 200, Shanxi Road. He hired Zhang Yuanfan from Shaoxing (31 years old this year, formerly a medicinal herb merchant) as the chief accountant, and Liao Youshan, a distant nephew of Liao, as the deputy accountant. Liao Haideng died two years ago. The Sichuan Cuisine Department of the Nanjing Hotel, which he contracted, was also closed at the end of last year due to sluggish business. Zhang Yuanfan and his colleague Shu Jiajun from Ningbo are now staying at Liao Haicheng's home at No. 11, Fuxianfang, Lane 411, Ladu Road, in the French Concession, clearing accounts. Liao Youshan returned to his native Sichuan. Unexpectedly, at 5:30 a.m. on May 4, Zhang Yuanfan was suddenly attacked with an axe in Liao Haicheng's home, suffering five wounds to the head, blood flowing freely. Because there were few people in the Liao household, and it was early morning, the assassin escaped with ease. Liao Guo, Liao Haicheng's widow (34 years old, from Sichuan), and Shu Jiajun sent the injured Zhang Yuanfan to Zhongshan Hospital on Fenglin Bridge for treatment. Due to the severity of the injuries, he died at 4:30 p.m. that afternoon. Liao Guo reported the incident to the French Police Department for investigation. The body was sent to the Tongrenfu Jiufentang for examination. Yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Special District Court and forensic doctor Wei visited the site and confirmed that Zhang Yuanfan had been attacked and died before his death. After questioning Liao Guo and Shu Jiajun about the circumstances of the victim's murder, as the victim's family was still in Shaoxing and would arrive in Shanghai in the next day or two, the court ordered that the body be examined and received by Tongrenfu Yuantang, pending receipt by the family. The police are currently investigating and arresting the murderer.

### Confirmation of Paternity Case Reopened for Debate and Concluded

The mother and son were expelled after the father had an affair early on; now that he is an adult, he cannot be a fatherless child.

Zheng Changshan, a 61-year-old man from Jiangbei, who lives in Jianyuli, in front of the Haichao Temple in the South City, used to be very poor. In recent years, he has become rich by renting rickshaws and has become a small wealthy family. Therefore, Zheng Afu (35 years old) filed a lawsuit with Zhou Yingjie, a lawyer, in the local court, requesting confirmation that Zheng Changshan is his biological father. He also stated that his mother was surnamed Sun. Because his father had an affair with a woman surnamed Xiong, the mother and son were driven out. Now that he is an adult, he cannot be a fatherless child. Zheng Changshan also hired Xu Heling, a lawyer, to argue that Sun was his concubine, and Afu was the son of her former husband. Sun used to dislike him for being poor and had an affair with another man. Now that she sees him rich, she wants to share the wealth and cannot recognize this son. The debate has already concluded, but because some key points were unclear, Judge Yuan Xiaogen reopened the debate yesterday. According to Zheng Changshan, he is from Yangzhou. He lived in Liujiabang, within the Lumen of Suzhou, when he was 30 years old. At that time, there was a neighbor who sold fruit, Qian Guan, who died of illness. His wife wanted to return to her hometown to find a way to make a living, so she entrusted her three-year-old child, Afu (the plaintiff), to Zheng Changshan's wife, Sun, to raise until he was seven years old. The judge asked, why did you say in your previous statement that the concubine Sun wanted her husband's son, Afu, and what you said today is completely different? What is the reason? You should know that stepchildren and adoption are different. Therefore, the debate was reopened. The answer was that it was indeed a foster relationship. The judge then questioned whether the words "son of the former husband" on the lawyer's statement were said by the party concerned or inferred by the lawyer. The answer was that the manuscript stated that Sun brought a son named Afu, so it was inferred that he was the son of Sun's former husband, etc. At this point, Zheng Changshan said, he said he is my son, please identify him. The judge ordered a recess. Then, the judge questioned the witness Wang Hainan, who testified that he rented rickshaws at the Wang Foji Rickshaw Company on the railway station road. Asked if Zheng Afu made a statement on February 20, 1930, and if he was there. The answer was that because Xiong gave birth to three children, the family was divided and Afu was given two rickshaws. Asked if he knew whether Afu was his biological son. The answer was that Zheng Changshan said he was adopted at the age of three. The judge also questioned Wang Hainan's brother, Wang Haiqing, as to whether he was a biological son. I am not a public relative, so I don't know. At this point, Zheng Afu testified that he was originally unwilling to sign the family division, but several elders said that father and son would still be father and son in the future, so I signed it. Now my father has 23 rickshaws with small licenses, 2 British licenses, 5 bungalows for rent, and 8 rooms built on leased land. I am also willing to have a blood test. At this point, Zheng Changshan testified that in 1923, Sun left him because she saw that he was poor and had an affair. Afu claimed that his father had Xiong and drove his mother away. The judge said that blood tests cannot be verified. This case is now clear, the debate is over, and the verdict will be announced on the 26th.

### Tramway in South City Temporarily Stopped Yesterday

Moldy Rain and Damaged Wires

Due to continuous moldy rain, the Nongquan tram line on Minguo Road in South City was suddenly damaged yesterday, causing the trams on Huashang Second Road, Third Road, and Yuan Road to be completely stopped. Although the China Electric Company ordered the repair of the wires, it took time due to the rain, so the trams inside and outside the circle from Dadongmen to Xiaonanmen were blocked. The tram cars on Zhonghua Road were still completely stopped. It was not until noon that the wires were repaired and resumed normal operation.

### Pawnshop on East Jiaxing Road Robbed Last Night

At 8:30 p.m. last night, two guests suddenly arrived at the branch of Huade Road Yunfei Automobile Company and rented a car from the company. The company sent a driver to drive car No. 12344 out. The two guests boarded the car and ordered it to drive towards Zhabei. When they reached Qingyun Road, one of them suddenly pulled out a pistol and forced the driver to sit in the back seat. The other person drove the car himself and turned south onto North Zhejiang Road and Tiantong Road. The car stopped in front of the Qianheng Pawnshop. One of the robbers got out of the car and planned to enter the shop to rob it. Later, he saw that the pawnshop's anti-theft equipment was very strict and there was no way to start, so he took the original car to the front of the Ruikang Pawnshop at No. 241, East Jiaxing Road. One robber walked into the pawnshop, broke into the shop, and threatened with a gun. The pawnshop was robbed of more than 30 yuan in legal tender. The robber carried the stolen goods out and fled in the original car. When the car reached the Xiaocai Market on Wuzhou Road, the two robbers got out of the car, paid the driver a fare of two yuan and several cents, and then fled separately. The driver went to the police station to report the case and then drove the car back to the company.

### Rickshaw Pullers Accused of Violating Industry Regulations

Since July 18 of last year, the Shanghai rickshaw industry has decided through the industry association in conjunction with the representatives of all the contractors in this city to discuss and agree on the regulations for rectifying the industry. After the regulations were implemented, the industry was again disrupted. Now, Ge Jingshan, Dai Fengshan, Bai Zhengang, and other contractors in Zhabei are working hard to restore the original plan for rectification. It is in the process of positive action. Yesterday morning, Zhu Lianke, a fixed rickshaw puller of Ge Jingshan, was sold at a lower price by Zhu Deyao. While operating on Datong Road, Ge Jingshan found out and immediately called the police. The rickshaw puller and vehicle No. 382 were taken to the police station together. It was found that they had violated industry regulations and hindered business operations. Zhu Deyao was ordered to appear in court. After a brief questioning, he was released on bail and the vehicle was returned. Ge Jingshan separately sued Zhu Deyao in the local court for disrupting business operations.

### Municipal Wharf Office Widely Seeks First Aid Medicines

For the Benefit of Workers

Since its reorganization, the Municipal Wharf Office has been working very hard. Recently, with the approach of the hot summer and the rampant spread of epidemics, the number of wharf workers in this city is large and their work is hard, making them particularly susceptible to seasonal epidemics. The office has sent letters to various charitable organizations and major pharmacies, widely seeking first aid medicines to be distributed to workers to prevent seasonal epidemics. The Yuanxia Guild Hall has sent 200 bottles of Yuanxia Shashi medicine, the French Pharmacy has sent 100 bottles of Seasonal Epidemic Water, Longhu Rendan has sent 100 packets, and Pengshoutang Chinese Medicine Store has sent 1,000 bottles of Shashi medicine. They are currently being properly distributed for forwarding.

### Qingyun Road Fire: Three Fire Starters Handed Over to Court

At the Xinchang Lane on Qingyun Road (intersection of Song Park Road) in Zhabei, a Shuntai Stationery Factory, established by Ningbo native Chen Shunchang, suddenly caught fire around 10 PM the night before. Various fire brigades were alerted and drove belt-driven pumps to extinguish the fire. It took over an hour to put it out. Subsequently, officers from the Zhongxing Road Police Station of the Xinzha Police Bureau were dispatched to arrest the factory owner Chen Shunchang, the cook Xie Fuchun (from Suzhou), and the factory worker Zhou Baochu (also from Ningbo). After being brought to the station, they confessed that the fire was caused by Zhou Baochu carelessly setting fire to firewood while stir-frying beans in the kitchen. A total of six buildings, including tall flat houses and lead-roofed houses, were destroyed, along with six machines, with an estimated loss of five to six thousand yuan. However, the factory had fire insurance of 14,000 yuan with Huaxin Insurance Company. After verifying the confession, the police station immediately sent the fire starters to the Xinzha Bureau. After further interrogation by the bureau officers, the two fire starters were handed over to the Shanghai Local Court for trial at around 4 PM yesterday.

### Yangtze River Reported Increasingly Flooded by Jianghai Customs

Hankou Water Level Approaching 40 Feet; Water Conservancy Bureau Strictly Orders Dike Protection and Flood Control

The Yangtze River's floodwaters are becoming increasingly critical. The Jiangnan Water Conservancy Engineering Office has strictly ordered all counties along the river to step up dike protection projects. The details are as follows:

Critical Situation

According to the river water level reports received yesterday morning by the Jianghai Customs, the situation is extremely critical. The Hankou water level is rapidly approaching 40 feet, not far from the water level during the major flood of 1931. The water levels in Jiujiang, Anqing, Wuhu, and other areas downstream from Hankou are also continuing to rise.

Water Level Report

The river water levels received yesterday morning by the Jianghai Customs are listed below: Hankou: 39 feet 9 inches; Jiujiang: 36 feet 6 inches; Anqing: 34 feet 1 inch; Wuhu: 23 feet 6 inches. The above are all downstream areas. The water levels in Changsha, in the middle reaches, have also risen to 21 feet 7 inches, and Yichang's water level has risen to 24 feet 6 inches.

Dike Protection and Flood Control

The Jiangsu Provincial Jiangnan Water Conservancy Engineering Office also considers the Yangtze River's rising water level to be serious and has issued a general order to Baoshan, Qidong, and other counties along the river to pay attention to dike protection projects. The county magistrates should personally inspect and send river water level readings to the office at any time. They have also set July 1 as the date for the start of flood control. According to observers concerned with the Yangtze River's water conservancy, the major flood has not yet begun, and the river has already flooded to this extent, which is cause for great concern.

### More on "A Fortnight in Xi'an"

— Zhong

Since the publication of "A Fortnight in Xi'an" by Chairman Chiang, this newspaper has written articles praising it, believing that this matter is not only a question of Chairman Chiang's safety but also a matter of our country's survival. Therefore, the popularity of this book does not need promotion; it has already spread rapidly. Here are some additional opinions to share with those who read this book.

When the Xi'an Incident suddenly occurred, the whole country was shocked and panicked, as if a great disaster was imminent, and the survival of the nation was in danger. Who knew that in less than three weeks, Chairman Chiang had safely escaped? This kind of miracle is unprecedented in Chinese history, and probably also in the history of other countries. Therefore, I say that this matter has three miracles.

Given Chairman Chiang's great personality, no unruly person would dare to commit such a reckless act, yet Chairman Chiang was kidnapped by rebels in Xi'an, which is the first miracle. After the kidnapping, the people of the whole country were worried about Chairman Chiang, believing that the rebels, having made the decision to kidnap him, would have no reason to regret their actions. Unexpectedly, Chairman Chiang safely escaped within two weeks, which is the second miracle. When the Xi'an Incident occurred, although no real news came out, general speculation held that Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng were responsible, with Zhang being the main culprit. Who knew that when Chairman Chiang returned south, Zhang Xueliang would follow him, which is a miracle on top of a miracle.

The most difficult thing was that when Chairman Chiang was kidnapped, he remained unyielding, spoke sternly, and vehemently rebuked the rebels, causing them to initially fear, then repent, and finally surrender. His spirit and righteousness were so moving and awe-inspiring that he truly embodied the character of an ancient minister facing death with integrity and unwavering principle.

Chairman Chiang's kidnapping by rebels was a serious matter, yet the central government officials were calm and composed, giving orders decisively. On one hand, they reorganized internally, and on the other hand, they sent troops to suppress the rebellion. Although they regarded Chairman Chiang as the sole leader of our country, they had to assert national power and enforce justice during his kidnapping. This was also the painstaking effort of the central government officials and the steps they had to take.

Madam Chiang prioritized saving lives, and her advocacy was consistent. Because Chairman Chiang is the sole leader of our country, saving Chairman Chiang is saving our country. If Chairman Chiang were in mortal danger, the country would be in dire straits. Furthermore, Madam Chiang is a woman, yet she dared to fly to Shaanxi and enter a dangerous place, ultimately returning safely south with Chairman Chiang. This kind of enthusiasm, courage, and strategy is rare in the biographies of women in our country.

Chairman Chiang is also very interested in literary research. Even amidst military affairs and busy schedules, he still reads books constantly and dedicates himself to the classics. Even during this ordeal, he was still studying the book of Mozi. With Chairman Chiang's innate intelligence and love of learning, his writings can undoubtedly serve as a model for scholars.

Therefore, I say that the book "A Fortnight in Xi'an" also has three miracles: not only is the event miraculous, but the person is also miraculous, and not only is the person miraculous, but the writing is also miraculous. In other words, it is a miraculous person, a miraculous event, and a miraculous book.

### The North

— Especially

It's summer, and the swallows with forked tails, impatient with the North's aridity and heat, fly over, chirping. Their wings carry a breeze, and the breeze carries a heavy letter: it says my hometown has changed, changed in ways that may be hard for me to believe. All sorts of ads are plastered all over the streets, and those harmful companies and restaurants have two or three locations on the street where we used to live. Of course, that's not all. At midnight, when people have sunk into the depths of sleep, hobnailed leather boots break the silence of the night, shaking your weary heart.

At this time, a very familiar sound sweeps across the vast wilderness, beginning to swirl in your ears—boom! Boom boom! The sound is very muffled, like muffled thunder on a cloudy day. However, there is a flash of light behind the muffled thunder, and a cloud scatters that light in a direction the eye cannot see.

Someone once said: "The ancient capital is suitable for living." At the time, you couldn't deny it. It wasn't noisy. It had spacious courtyards with houses that could accommodate all sorts of people quite comfortably. It had palaces that were dilapidated but still magnificent. It had summer resorts and mountain scenery and springs. Most importantly, the people who lived there mostly had simple, straightforward, and warm hearts because of ingrained habits. This feeling made people cherish and respect each other.

But precisely because of this, those who are treacherous and cunning easily "attack the weak points" and seize this territory. Now, if you could come back and walk through the hutongs or alleys just once, you would definitely be surprised. The iron hammer of reality shatters your past beautiful dreams. You would never imagine that strong bodies could become hunched over, and that faces built of muscle could become so thin and gaunt that they no longer look human. Of course, there's much more. Is the ancient capital suitable for living? Never mind!

We used to eat fried meat pies together at "Flower Market" at Dongcheng Root. The old man who sold the pies was very polite to us, always adding more oil and frying them until they were golden brown. And now? He's dead. His son has taken up another occupation. I've only seen him twice. And "Flower Market" has become even more desolate...

It is cloudy outside the window, and it is raining lightly. After reading this letter, I was "sad for a long time." I never imagined that in these short eight years, the devil's claws would stretch from the vast fertile fields outside the Pass into the lovely ancient capital and its surrounding areas. What can I say? My heart feels like it's being weighed down by a piece of iron, and my mood is the same as the cloudy sky.

Lying in bed, bedbugs attack from all directions, biting me so that I can't sleep. So I opened my mind and took out the sweet dreams of "Flower Market"—

At most, I was only seven or seven years old at that time. At the end of the previous year, I braved the danger, taking a covered wagon in the fierce wind and snow, rushing to my hometown along the Longhai and Jinghan lines. My legs and feet were swollen so badly that I couldn't get out of bed for two months. Later, when spring arrived, I got better. It happened that a relative's family had someone die, and they called me to keep them company, so I lived in the "Five Elders Hutong" middle school.

Leaving the hutong and turning a corner, you would arrive at Hadamen Street. At Hadamen, there was a train track that surrounded the city root and stretched past, and "Flower Market Street" was located on the south side where the track didn't reach. This street was diagonally straight. Gradually, as you walked past the opening, the houses became fewer, and the jagged city piles threatened the snakelike track, forming a big encirclement. At that time, there weren't many flowers on this street. The collapse of the royal family took away its "good fortune." However, women in my hometown were particular about wearing "head flowers," so there was a considerable scene on "Dishi" (that is, the fourth, fourteenth, and twenty-fourth days of the month). This scene had nothing to do with us. We only knew that every day we would take a few coins, sneak to the Flower Market to buy two meat pies, and then sneak back, afraid that our relatives would see us and say something about hygiene. Afterwards, we would wipe our mouths clean, leaving no trace!

Now, Flower Market has become even more dilapidated, and the old man who sold meat pies has transcended the human world. And leather boots break the silence of the night, advertisements and companies crisscross the streets, there are pale faces, a gloomy atmosphere, and the rumble of artillery... "The North" has changed. What kind of scene is needed!

### Where Do the Slum Dwellers Go? How Do the Slum Dwellers Live?

— Zhong

The slum dwellers, who have always been forgotten, have fortunately been brought to people's attention by the demolition carried out by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession.

Pilgrimages and visits are taking place, and newspapers have many reports.

It's just that everyone is describing it so conceptually, giving people the impression that it is still just a "poor and miserable" image. This image is easily forgotten and cannot serve as a basis for targeted relief and improvement.

From the slum household survey statistics below, their life outlines are clearly revealed. They are now listed as follows:

Zhang Family Residence Slum Population Age Statistics:

(Male) (Female) Total

Under 5 years old 39 40 79

5 to 10 years old 48 43 91

11 to 20 years old 84 74 158

21 to 30 years old 60 50 110

31 to 40 years old 66 42 108

41 to 50 years old 51 45 96

51 to 60 years old 31 30 61

Over 60 years old 11 12 23

The entire area has 150 households, with a total population of 726 men and women. The average is less than five people per household.

In terms of age ratio, the most numerous are children under ten years old to young people up to twenty years old, followed by young people from twenty to thirty years old, and then adults from thirty to forty years old. The elderly are the fewest, which shows that blind childbearing is prevalent among them. As for why there are so few elderly people, we can say that part of their lifespan has been taken away by their impoverished lives. (Note: The average lifespan of rickshaw pullers is five years).

In terms of gender ratio, there are only 54 more men than women.

Zhang Family Residence Slum Origin Statistics:

(Male) (Female) (Total)

Yancheng, Jiangsu 293 253 546

Gaoyou, Jiangsu 17 10 27

Funing, Jiangsu 21 18 39

Dongtai, Jiangsu 15 9 24

Taizhou, Jiangsu 19 25 44

Xinghua, Jiangsu 4 1 5

Haizhou, Jiangsu 2 3 5

Yangzhou, Jiangsu 5 3 8

Qingjiang, Jiangsu 4 2 6

Suqian, Jiangsu 2 3 5

Changzhou, Jiangsu 0 1 1

Shandong 3 2 5

Anhui 5 4 9

Beijing 1 0 1

Jiaxing, Zhejiang 0 1 1

Total 391 335 726

From this table, we can see that those from Yancheng, Jiangsu, account for 80 percent. Taizhou, Funing, Gaoyou, Dongtai, Yangzhou, Qingjiang, Xinghua, Haizhou, Suqian, and Changzhou are also numerous. Shandong, Anhui, Beijing, and Zhejiang account for only about 2 percent of the total. Why are there so many from Jiangsu and so few from other provinces? This can be explained from the following aspects:

㊀ The closer the place is to Shanghai and the more convenient the transportation, the more people come. The fact that there are five people from Shandong and one from Beijing is because they are too far away.

㊁ The more severe the rural bankruptcy, the more people flee to the cities to survive. I don't know how bankrupt the counties of Jiancheng, Taizhou, Funing, and Dongtai are, but Zhejiang's Jiaxing is very close to Shanghai, and the reason why there is only one person is because Zhejiang's rural areas are much richer than those in northern Jiangsu.

Zhang Family Residence Slum Household Monthly Income Statistics:

Under 5 yuan 12 households

5 yuan to 10 yuan 65 households

11 yuan to 15 yuan 35 households

16 yuan to 20 yuan 25 households

21 yuan to 25 yuan 1 household

26 yuan to 30 yuan 10 households

31 yuan to 35 yuan 0 households

36 yuan to 40 yuan 1 household

41 yuan to 45 yuan 0 households

The grass shacks in the Hudong District of the Public Concession were demolished not long ago, and now the grass shacks in the Huxi District are about to be demolished. "Where do the slum dwellers go?" This question will be raised again by those who care.

Here, we publish the statistics of 150 slum households in Zhang Family Residence in the West Gate. The slum dwellers of Zhang Family Residence are somewhat luckier than the slum dwellers in the Hudong and Huxi Districts. They have not yet suffered the misfortune of "being displaced," but how are they living? I ask readers to think about this again after reading this.

As for those who are not even allowed to live such a poor and miserable life and are even ordered to demolish their homes, it is hard to know where to begin. (Editor)

46 yuan to 50 yuan 0 households

51 yuan to 100 yuan 1 household (Note: This household rents out rickshaws for a living and earns 80 yuan a month. They own their grass shack.)

Total 150 households

This table tells us that 77 households have a total monthly income of less than 10 yuan, accounting for more than half of all households. If we calculate based on an average of five people per household, each person has less than two yuan per month for living expenses!

Sixty households have an income of 11 to 20 yuan, accounting for 40 percent of all households, and each person has less than four yuan per month!

Eleven households have an income of 20 to 30 yuan, accounting for nearly 10 percent of all households, which means that each person has six yuan per month for living expenses.

A person, a worker who sweats and bleeds, expends so much energy every day, and yet their food supply is only two yuan per month!

I'm afraid the noble gentlemen and ladies don't know this, do they?

Zhang Family Residence Slum Household Debt Statistics

Under 10 yuan 1 household

10 yuan to 15 yuan 10 households

16 yuan to 20 yuan 13 households

71 yuan to 80 yuan 10 households

81 yuan to 90 yuan 0 households

91 yuan to 100 yuan 17 households

101 yuan to 150 yuan 3 households

151 yuan to 200 yuan 2 households

201 yuan to 400 yuan 2 households

401 yuan to 600 yuan 1 household

No debt 44 households

Surplus 1 household (Note: This household earns 80 yuan a month)

Total 150 households

Debt is their only remedy, but how cruel is the sucking they receive from usury systems such as big and small loan sharks! There are no numbers to prove usury, so I won't discuss it. If you don't owe any money, there are only 44 households, accounting for 30 percent of all households. There is only one household with a surplus, which is an exception. Debt reaches 70 percent of all households. The most common debt is 90 to 100 yuan, followed by 20 to 30 yuan. Why do they carry it down with a "falling rain, straw heavier and heavier" load? Do they want to?
