### Our Loyal and Brave First Battalion of Isolated Troops Received Orders This Morning to Endure the Pain and Withdraw from Zhabei

After four days and nights of fierce fighting, more than thirty brave soldiers were injured. We held our original positions in Guangfu and Xiaonanxiang. The artillery battle on both sides of the West Suzhou River was also intense.

The heroic soldiers of the First Battalion of the 88th Division, led by Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan and Battalion Commander Yang Ruifu, who vowed to shed their last drop of blood and fight to the death against the enemy to defend the nation's supreme dignity and promote the nation's awe-inspiring righteousness, have been defending the Sihang Warehouse in Zhabei for four days. This magnificent feat, worthy of song and tears, has aroused worldwide respect and sympathy. Our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, deeply appreciated and was moved by the fact that this battalion of brave soldiers regarded death as home, were loyal and brave, loved the country, and lived up to the purpose of their usual training and teaching. However, considering the current long-term war of resistance, the nation has high expectations for these loyal and brave soldiers. If they are allowed to defend their isolated army to the death and make heroic sacrifices, it would also be a great loss to the nation. It would be better to endure the pain and abandon this last position in Zhabei, so that these brave soldiers can find other ways to serve the country. Therefore, he ordered Yang Hu, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, to guide the regiment to withdraw voluntarily. It is reported that after receiving the order, Commander Yang, together with Sun, the commander of the 88th Division, conveyed the secret order in extremely difficult circumstances. Our battalion of loyal and brave soldiers were all moved to tears by the supreme leader's sincere care for his comrades. They had to obey the strict military orders and prepare to endure the pain of abandoning this precious last position. Last night, the enemy repeatedly launched a general attack on the Sihang Warehouse, and the sound of gunfire was very fierce. Our loyal and brave soldiers remained calm and ignored it. After two o'clock, our brave soldiers, amidst the enemy's heavy encirclement and strict guard, with mysterious and unpredictable actions, braced themselves, reorganized their ranks, and safely withdrew from this last fortress in Zhabei. About two hours later, the entire team arrived in a safe area. In summary, our brave soldiers fought fiercely for four days, annihilating more than a hundred enemies. More than ten of our brave soldiers also died. This heroic feat has left a deep and indelible impression on the world, and our brave soldiers will show their heroic skills even more in the future in resisting the enemy and defending the country.

The enemy army attempted to force our army to withdraw from the Shanghai area. After advancing to the north bank of the Suzhou River in western Shanghai, they temporarily stopped crossing the river to advance south for fear of being threatened by our Nanxiang area. They are now actively attacking Nanxiang. On the front line of Xiaonanxiang, the enemy attacked in two routes. After holding out all night, the enemy's right-wing troops were repelled by us at three o'clock this morning. The enemy suffered about several hundred casualties. By dawn, their frontal troops also made no progress and retreated completely. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy was also active along Zhenbei Road. Around seven o'clock in the evening, the enemy had approached our warning positions in the area of Lujia Ku, Lizhai, and Xiajiazhai. Our army immediately outflanked from both wings, echoed with the front, and launched a group attack, starting a fierce battle that did not stop until late at night. Our army had a clear advantage. At the same time, enemy artillery continuously bombarded our positions from the Toyota Mill to Zhoujiaqiao on the south bank, and we also returned fire from time to time, aiming to destroy the enemy artillery positions. After our army retreated to the second line of defense, the positions between Xiaonanxiang and Jiangqiao were strengthened yesterday, becoming more consolidated. Moreover, because the Luoyang Bridge Zhennan Road section was too prominent, it has now been withdrawn and moved backward, forming a vertical line. There were no changes to the positions on the south bank of the Suzhou River.

### Our Loyal and Brave Soldiers Talk About the Four Days of Fierce Fighting

Prepared various defensive works inside the building. Guarded day and night, and did not feel tired from killing the enemy. Two national flags have been carefully carried out.

This newspaper's reporter went to the Xinlaji Bridge area again after one o'clock this morning to inspect the situation. At that time, the bloody battle between the two sides was in full swing, and stray bullets were flying everywhere. Nearby residents were awakened from their sleep and gathered in the streets to inquire about the situation. At exactly two o'clock, the sound of gunfire suddenly stopped. The reporter went up to the roof of a building and looked into the distance, and saw that the top floor of the Sihang Warehouse on the opposite bank was burning brightly. The Continental Bank godown next door was unharmed, and there was a flashlight shining on the roof. Not long after, there was a sudden noise, and listening carefully, it seemed to be speaking Japanese. At that time, it was speculated that our loyal and brave soldiers must have received orders to withdraw safely. He hurried to inquire nearby and learned that they had indeed all withdrawn at 2:10 this morning. The reporter also tracked them down and rushed to the scene, where reporters from various countries were gathered to interview them. Some of our brave soldiers were resting on the ground on the scene. The reporter stepped forward to greet them. Our brave soldiers were in high spirits and showed no signs of fatigue despite having fought for several hours. According to them, we had already made up our minds to die and coexist with the last position in Zhabei. Various defensive works had been prepared inside the Sihang Warehouse building, which was sufficient for us to defend it to the death. All of us had not slept for four nights, and we guarded and killed the enemy day and night. Because everyone was too excited, we did not feel tired at all. Tonight (that is, last night), the enemy launched a fierce attack, and we responded calmly. The enemy soldiers could not get close. Finally, we received the order from our Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to withdraw, and we reluctantly said goodbye to our last position in Zhabei. Regiment Commander Xie directed the battle with great spirit and is now resting upstairs. Battalion Commander Yang suffered a minor leg injury, and more than ten brothers were injured, and four died. The national flags hanging on the roofs of the Sihang and Continental warehouses have been carefully carried out. From now on, we will still adhere to our determination to sacrifice ourselves and fight the enemy to the end, fulfilling our responsibility to defend the country, etc.

### Our Loyal and Brave Isolated Army Fought to the Death Last Night

Gunfire and artillery roared like thunder on the banks of the Suzhou River. All parties sent telegrams to express their respect to the soldiers.

At 10:30 last night, the enemy army launched a large-scale attack on our Sihang Warehouse in Zhabei. Our eight hundred loyal and brave soldiers immediately rose up to meet the enemy. For a time, the sound of machine guns was as dense as a string of beads, and the sound of hand grenades exploded like thunder. This newspaper's reporter went to inspect the scene in person. Stray bullets flew across the Suzhou River. Tang Fulin (57 years old, from Suzhou, butcher), a resident of Room 174 in Hongfuli, Xinzha Road, was hit in the right hip by a stray bullet and was taken to the hospital by ambulance. The battle situation became increasingly fierce until 12:30 this morning. Not only did the sound of hand grenades explode continuously, but it was also mixed with the extremely fierce sound of steel cannons. The Chinese and Western detectives standing at the intersection of Xinzha Road were shaken to the point that they could not stand and moved south towards Avenue Edouard VII. The fierce battle stopped around 2:00 am.

According to the Central News Agency, the battalion of loyal and brave soldiers who have been defending the Sihang Warehouse in Zhabei to the death for four days suddenly encountered a fierce general attack by the enemy army last night. Our brave soldiers fought hard in the rain of bullets and guns, fighting the enemy with blood and hardship, unyielding and indomitable, which is inspiring and indescribable. The enemy army began to attack at around 9:00 last night. For a time, the sound of machine guns and rifles was loud, which greatly alarmed the residents of the nearby concession, but it soon stopped. At 10:30, the enemy army launched a large-scale attack. Our brave soldiers remained calm and did not waste valuable ammunition. When the enemy approached, they threw hand grenades at the enemy fiercely. More than fifty enemy soldiers were killed. Therefore, the enemy's ferocity flared up and they attacked incessantly. At 1:00 this morning, they used three-inch flat-fire cannons to bombard the Sihang Warehouse fiercely. At the most intense moment, they fired one shot every second. The rumbling sound shattered the silent air of the long night. At that time, the reporter drove to the intersection of North Xizang Road and Xinzha Road to inspect the situation. In the rumbling sound of artillery, he only heard the sharp stray bullets whizzing over his head. Because one person was hit and seriously injured by a stray bullet that penetrated the roof, the nearby residents, carrying the old and the young, scrambled to escape, and the scene was very miserable. Stray bullets flew everywhere in the concession, and even the western district was not spared. Although our army was in a difficult situation, its combat attitude was obviously very calm. The reporter identified the sound of gunfire and determined that the dense sound of machine guns was fired by our army to prevent the enemy from approaching.

### The Enemy's Attack on Guangfu Has Been Repelled

The damaged fortifications have been repaired despite the artillery fire. The enemy's attack north of Caowang Temple has also been driven back.

According to a Central News Agency reporter accompanying the army in Guangfu at 10:00 am on the 30th, the enemy's attack on Guangfu was even more urgent. They bombarded it continuously from 2:00 am yesterday morning to 6:00 pm, firing more artillery than in the past ten days. Part of our fortifications were destroyed, but they were repaired by our army despite the artillery fire, and the original number was restored immediately. At about 2:00 pm, about several hundred enemies charged our right-wing positions five times in a row, but they were all repelled by us. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, and we captured one prisoner.

According to a Central News Agency reporter accompanying the army in Guangfu at 10:00 am on the 30th, at 2:00 am this morning, more than a hundred enemies, under the cover of artillery fire, attacked our Zhao Family Block position north of Caowang Temple. Our army responded calmly and launched a trench attack. By dawn, the enemy had been driven back.

According to a Central News Agency reporter accompanying the army in Guangfu at 10:00 am on the 29th (delayed), yesterday (the 28th) afternoon, the enemy released a smoke screen east of Guangfu to cover their engineers carrying wood to build fortifications. Several hundred enemies attacked our Majiazhai area. After our courageous counterattack, many enemies were killed, and less than half of the enemies survived. At night, the enemy also attempted to build a pontoon bridge near Zhujiazhai north of Guangfu, hoping to cross the Yangjing River to attack, but they were also repelled by our army. Also, enemy artillery continuously attacked our positions from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm, firing hundreds of shells, but our fortifications were not damaged and we ignored them.

According to a Central News Agency reporter accompanying the army in Guangfu at 10:00 am on the 29th (delayed), the enemy troops in the areas of Zadian West, Wujiazhai, and Yanjiazhai,

Took advantage of the dark night to build a communication trench parallel to our positions. At 8:00 am this morning (the 29th), enemy armored vehicles and heavy trucks suddenly appeared near Wujiazhai, carrying several enemy officers, and spied on our Shixianggong Temple area. After our artillery attacked, several shells hit, and the enemy's heavy truck was overturned. The enemy officers fell into the field and were extremely embarrassed. Their armored vehicles immediately opened fire to cover their retreat.

According to a Central News Agency reporter accompanying the army in Guangfu at 11:30 pm on the 30th, our positions on the line from Nijiayuan to Sunjiaqiao north of Guangfu were attacked by about three companies of enemies starting at 4:00 am. Our army bravely counterattacked, repeatedly charging, and fighting fiercely. The two sides fought fiercely for four hours, advancing and retreating many times, and finally defeated the enemy. The enemy army suffered many casualties.

### There Was a Fierce Battle on Zhenda Road Yesterday

After three hours of bloody fighting, more than 400 enemies were killed. The enemy artillery bombarded the Toyota Mill, but we still held on. The artillery battle along the Suzhou River was intense.

According to a Central News Agency reporter accompanying the army at 1:00 pm on the 20th, another battle for positions broke out on Zhenda Road at 3:30 this morning. The enemy used more than 20 tanks to cover 5,000 enemy troops, who attacked south along the highway from Xujiazhai South Ku to Jijiaku, Panzhai, and Daijiazhai. The fire line was about 2 kilometers long. The two sides fought bloody battles for three hours. At dawn, our army charged the enemy head-on from the highway and drove the enemy back. At the same time, the left and right wings coordinated their advance and forced them to retreat. In this battle, the enemy suffered more than 400 casualties, and we captured 5 small cannons and more than 20 rifles.

According to a Central News Agency reporter accompanying the army at 1:00 pm on the 30th, the enemy's Toyota Mill is located on the south bank of the Suzhou River, west of Zhongshan Road. The enemy army originally built solid fortifications there. Now our army is stationed there, and it is one of the important strongholds. The enemy army concentrated its mortars on the area last night and bombarded it, hitting more than ten shells. One part was destroyed and another part was burned. After we rearranged it, it was extremely strong.

According to Huadong News Agency, Toyota is the base camp for enemy capitalists to suck our blood. It was founded in the 10th year of the Republic of China and has seized more than 100 million yuan in cash from us in the past 16 years. At the time of its establishment, it had a capital of 10 million taels of silver, and now it has a public reserve of 40,907,000 yuan. It is organized by Japanese tycoons Toyoda Risaburo, Nishikawa Akitsugu, and Kuroda Akami. Now that it is being destroyed by enemy warlords, it is no different from being enemies with those tycoons.

According to a Central News Agency reporter accompanying the army at 9:00 pm on the 30th, there were no battles along the Suzhou River, but the enemy army's artillery fire continued to bombard the south bank. The sound of artillery was especially dense at night. Enemy aircraft were unusually active, circling over the Xujiahui area to spy on the situation, and dropped several bombs behind our army's positions in the western district, but our fortifications were not damaged.

### Last Night, Enemy and Our Forces Engaged in an Artillery Battle Across the River

The enemy's base in eastern Shanghai was hit by multiple artillery shells from our forces. Enemy aircraft bombed Pudong and spied on the Nanshi area all day long.

At 7:40 last night, the enemy flagship Izumo, which was docked at the No. 2 pontoon in the Huangpu River, suddenly led five or six large and small enemy warships docked at the Mitsubishi Wharf, the Pudong water surface, and the No. 1 and No. 4 pontoons to fire artillery at our Pudong area. Our Pudong artillery positions also immediately fired back. For a time, the rumbling sound shook the entire city of Shanghai, and there were intermittent machine gun sounds, mutually guarding and attacking each other until after 9:00, when they stopped. It is reported that the enemy's base in the eastern Shanghai area was hit by multiple artillery shells from our forces and suffered heavy damage.

Also, at 1:30 yesterday afternoon, two enemy aircraft flew to the sky above Pudong to circle and reconnoiter, and then dropped many bombs in the areas of Yangjiadu, Lujiadu, and Tangqiao, destroying more than 20 civilian houses. The Zhang Wanxing Shipyard in Tangqiao Town was bombed and caught fire, burning fiercely. At about 4:00, the two aircraft escaped. In addition, another nine enemy aircraft took turns, each time with three aircraft at most and one at least, circling back and forth in the sky over the Nanshi area, spying all day long, and did not leave until late at night, but did not drop any bombs.

### The Enemy Suffered Losses in Troops and Equipment in the Attack on Qingshui

The wind direction suddenly changed after poison gas was released. Our army reinforced and killed more than 100 enemies.

According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 30th, according to military news, the Shanghai battle report: ㊀ Since the night of the 28th, the enemy has been engaged in fierce skirmishes with a certain unit of ours in the Jinjia Xinjing area on the northern front along the railway. There were no particularly fierce battles on the rest of the front line. ㊁ At 3:00 pm on the 28th, the enemy attacked our Qingshui Town and Xinluzhai positions, releasing poison gas. The guards of a certain unit of ours were poisoned, their eyes watering and unable to see. The enemy broke in. Later, because the wind turned towards the enemy, our reinforcements counterattacked, killing many enemies. A certain unit of ours captured three enemy light machine guns and more than 30 rifles. Our army also suffered more than 100 officer and soldier casualties.

### Large Numbers of Enemy Aircraft Wreaked Havoc Everywhere

Machine guns fired indiscriminately, and refugees were killed and injured. Huiling Railway Station was also bombed.

Starting at 1:00 pm yesterday, large numbers of enemy aircraft again wreaked havoc everywhere. Nine giant twin-engine heavy bombers went to western Shanghai, four light bombers went to the Nanshi area, and three seaplanes went to Pudong. More than 20 bombs were dropped in total, and machine guns were used to indiscriminately sweep downwards in the Pudong and western Shanghai areas, so many refugees were injured. However, our army's fortifications were not damaged at all.

Starting at 7:00 yesterday morning, two or three enemy aircraft often circled and reconnoitered in places such as Zhongshan Road and Caoxi Road. At 10:50, three enemy aircraft continuously dropped six bombs near the Huiling Middle School Railway, which were all barren land with no houses or few pedestrians. Although one bomb exploded, there was no loss.

Enemy aircraft reconnoitered in the Nanshi area for days. Yesterday morning, three aircraft circled, and at 2:00 pm, nine aircraft circled, but they flew quite low and did not drop bombs, and flew towards western Shanghai.

### Investigation into the Tragic Bombing of Songjiang by Enemy Aircraft for Several Days

More than 200 bombs were dropped, destroying more than 2,000 houses. American churches and schools were all reduced to ashes.

The reporter went to the countryside the day before yesterday for some business and returned to Songjiang by special boat this morning (the 30th). The tragic situation of the bombing along the way into the city was heartbreaking. About 2,000 houses were bombed and collapsed. The number of deaths was not easy to investigate at once. It was truly an unprecedented catastrophe. The following is a brief record of what I saw and heard:

At about 3:00 pm on the 28th, several enemy aircraft came to Songjiang and dropped 34 bombs in the city, destroying more than 200 houses. The losses in the areas of the County Normal School, Suodi Gaojia Yan, etc. were very heavy.

Fortunately, the residents were calm, and there were fewer deaths and injuries. They also fired machine guns for 30 minutes. At 9:05 on the 29th, a total of 12 enemy aircraft came one after another and dropped bombs twice inside and outside the city, totaling nearly 200 shots. Eight bombs landed in the county government in the city, destroying the front and rear gates. Several people were killed or injured.

### During the past month, our army fought bloody battles near Chuanshakou and Sucun and captured various spoils of war.

### 20,000 Overseas Chinese from Taiwan Have Not Returned

Many Fujian and Taiwanese people have restored their nationality.

Fuzhou Communication, there are a total of more than 50,000 overseas Chinese residing in Taiwan, most of whom are from Fujian. Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, they have returned to China one after another because they cannot bear the oppression of the Taiwan government. There are now more than 20,000 people. There are still more than 10,000 people, who are specially hired by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the British ship Rorore Malle, transporting 5,000 people each time, and it will take more than a month to leave Taiwan completely. The British ship is berthed at Kaohsiung, but the enemy actually charges each overseas Chinese 8 or 9 yuan for the ride from Keelung to Kaohsiung. According to a returnee, the situation in Taiwan's interior is extremely chaotic. Because they are afraid of our army's attack, people are very restless. The explosion of the arsenal on Penghu Island caused extremely heavy losses. The Taiwanese people who were conscripted into the army were initially only assigned to be porters, and then they were successively incorporated into the supplementary service. The families of those who were conscripted were plunged into a state of helplessness, suffering on the starvation line, and complaining. They all naturally had the idea of ​​the motherland, but because the Japanese were extremely vigilant, they have not been able to raise the flag of revolution immediately. After our air force showed its great achievements, the enemy was deeply frightened. The Taiwan side, because it is close to our country, was especially flustered. Currently, coastal areas such as Keelung, Kaohsiung, and Tamsui in Taiwan are covered with thatched houses and equipped with electric lights as fake markets to prevent our air force from attacking, etc.

The number of Taiwanese people residing in Fujian who are unwilling to return to their hometowns and request to restore their Chinese nationality is increasing day by day, and they are enthusiastically donating money as funds to resist the enemy. In order to guide the actions of these Taiwanese people who have restored their nationality, the Provincial Anti-Enemy Support Association has specially convened relevant agencies to organize the Overseas Chinese Naturalization and Renationalization Guidance Committee, which is specifically responsible for handling guidance and review matters. In addition to the committee preparing the application form, volunteer form, and guarantee form in accordance with the Implementing Regulations of the Nationality Law for use, it also sent a letter to the Department of Civil Affairs yesterday to check and order the Provincial Police Bureau, the Minhou County Government, the Xiamen Municipal Government, and the minority county governments with resident overseas Chinese to transfer the names, ages, occupations, and family conditions of the Taiwanese people residing in their jurisdictions to their subordinate Lianbao directors for registration in advance to facilitate the process. The provincial government recently sent Sa Zhenbing, Hu Zhaoxiang, Ye Daoyuan, Zeng Jianping, Huang Wan, Guo Hongzhong, etc. as special economic commissioners to Nanyang to investigate Singapore, Penang, Java and other places to comfort the overseas Chinese and to enrich the economic strength of the rear in our country's long-term war of resistance. It is extremely important to conduct the following tasks ㊀ Invite overseas Chinese to invest in various economic construction matters, ㊁ Solicit national salvation bonds, ㊂ Solicit donations to relieve wounded soldiers and victims in the war zone. Sa et al. have already left the province for Hong Kong to go abroad, and will probably be able to return to China by the end of the lunar year (October 21).

### Enemy Giant Aircraft Shot Down in Nanxiang

The pilot and six others were captured by our forces and the enemy aircraft worth 500,000 yuan was destroyed.

According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Suzhou on the 30th, according to a report from a reporter on the front line, at 9:00 am on the 29th, the enemy used six heavy bombers to fly to the Nanxiang area to bomb wantonly in an attempt to destroy our positions. Our army densely fired anti-aircraft guns at them, and one of them was hit in a vital point and fell on the spot near the northern section of Nanxiang. The enemy pilot and six others were captured by our forces and will be escorted to Beijing. It is said that the enemy aircraft is a three-engine aircraft, worth more than 500,000 yuan, and is a rare giant aircraft in the enemy's air force.

### The enemy made six reinforcements, and the fifth batch of more than 1,000 people arrived in Shanghai.

According to the Central News Agency, at about 7:00 am yesterday (the 30th), the enemy's 21st transport ship and the transport ship Ikuta Maru, which was rebuilt from a merchant ship, sailed to Shanghai one after another and docked at the Qiujiang Wharf and the Zhaoshangju North Warehouse, carrying the fifth batch of the enemy's sixth reinforcements, about 1,000 people, and more than 1,000 boxes of military supplies, which were immediately landed and unloaded ashore. In addition, there were also the transport ships Longjiang Maru and Belfart Maru No. 343 at Qiujiang Wharf, which were also unloading military supplies and wood. As for the rest of the transport ships, they have all left Shanghai and returned to Japan.

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Reiterates Firm Stance, Resolves to Vigorously Proceed According to Original Plan

Japanese Aggression Promotes Our Revival and Unification　Ambassador Gu States Our Nation's Determination to Resist to the End　Japan Probes for Peace Negotiation Atmosphere, but No One Pays Attention

[Paris] General Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Executive Yuan of China, gave an interview to Mr. Hélsey, the China correspondent of the local "Daily News." The newspaper has now published the interview, along with a brief biography and recent photographs of Chiang. Hélsey first described the events of the past few years and the important tasks undertaken by Chiang, quoting the London Sunday Times to say that the future of China should be based on nationalism, socialism, and democracy. Chiang's remarks included, "Regardless of how the situation of our resistance to Japanese aggression develops, the unified state will inevitably become stronger as a result. Japan's unjust war against us is precisely accelerating the completion of our nation's revival and unification. China's predetermined national construction plan will continue to be vigorously pursued, and nothing can hinder it. The patriotic sentiment of the Chinese people is so passionate, and the morale is so strong; we can overcome all difficulties through it. Our current resistance is not only for our own interests but also for the justice of the entire world. If the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact are allowed to be torn up by Japan, the foundation of world peace will inevitably be shaken. We must continue to fight until complete victory for justice is achieved." Furthermore, other important figures in the Chinese government also stated that although the current situation is serious, China will certainly achieve final victory. (Central News Agency, 30th, Havas dispatch)

[Paris] A Reuters reporter today visited Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to France, to ask if reconciliation between China and Japan was still possible. Ambassador Gu's answer was very firm, stating that while China loves peace, it is unwilling to exchange peace at any cost. Today, there are rumors of Chinese military defeats, but observe how the Chinese army is demonstrating its power, already able to resist Japanese aggression. This is contrary to what most people expected. China is prepared to resist to the end, and the issue of Japan's special rights will not be tolerated. When Chinese territory is under Japanese invasion, cooperation with Japan is absolutely impossible. Consider how we can cooperate with a country that is causing China to bleed. It is regrettable that Japan is unwilling to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. If Japan has any justification, it should participate in this conference without hesitation. The reporter asked whether China expects political or material assistance from the Brussels Conference. Ambassador Gu replied that China did not convene the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. What China expects is respect for treaty rights. This not only concerns China's future but also the principle of respecting treaties. Dr. Gu will travel to Brussels on Sunday as China's chief representative to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, which opens on November 3rd. (Central News Agency, 30th, Reuters dispatch)

[London] According to reliable sources, Japan is now eager for a ceasefire in Shanghai. Even Japanese warlords are becoming increasingly anxious about Japan's huge commitments in North China. However, it is widely believed that China will not agree to a ceasefire in Shanghai, as this would allow the Japanese army to focus its efforts on North China. A prominent member of Parliament expressed his opinion to a Reuters reporter, saying that Japan's expenditures are enormous and its strength is weakening daily, which other countries are pleased to see. If Japan realizes this, the best opportunity for peace will have arrived. As for China's surprising resilience, it is known to all. At the same time, military observers are paying close attention to the Sino-Japanese conflict, unanimously praising the skill and order of the Chinese army's retreat in Shanghai, and believing that the new Chinese positions are more solid than the old ones, making it even more difficult for the Japanese army to break through. (Central News Agency, 30th, Reuters dispatch)

[London] Today, Far Eastern securities on the stock exchange showed an upward trend, but well-informed circles remained cautious, and trading was very limited. The Financial Times editorial today stated that while the stock market is more optimistic, this cannot be attributed to news from the Far East. Although Chinese and Japanese securities were slightly stronger yesterday, the moves to explore peace are not being taken seriously at this time. Japan clearly wants to occupy a dominant position in the five northern provinces of China, but a China that is becoming more united is unable to make such concessions. Therefore, the stock market is unlikely to be affected until there is greater hope for a peaceful atmosphere. (Central News Agency, 30th, Reuters dispatch)

### Soviet Russia to Participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference

Brussels Prepares Venue, Expected to Be Ready Soon　Representatives from Various Countries Largely Appointed

[Moscow] Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union recently sent a note to the Belgian Embassy in Russia, accepting participation. The note stated that although the Soviet Union is not a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty, it is deeply concerned about the Far East issue. Furthermore, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is convened in accordance with the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly on October 7th. Therefore, the Soviet government declares its readiness to send personnel to participate. (Central News Agency, 29th, Havas dispatch)

⊙Brussels The Nine-Power Treaty Conference is scheduled to open on the third of next month at the Tongru College here. The Belgian authorities are now actively engaged in preparations and are expected to be ready within days. It is estimated that the total number of delegates, secretariat members, and other personnel from various countries, along with journalists from various countries, will be in the hundreds. The college's facilities may be slightly insufficient at that time. The press seating area in the conference hall is located next to the platform and is equipped with 22 temporary telephone booths for the use of the journalists.

[Berlin] Regarding Germany's refusal of the Belgian government's invitation to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, political figures here expressed their opinions, pointing out that the Belgian government invited the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to participate in the conference in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of the treaty. Germany, not being a signatory country, although later invited to join, did not ratify it. Furthermore, the Beijing Conference was convened at the urging of the League of Nations, and Germany is not a member of the League of Nations. Therefore, the political circles believe that the German government's refusal to participate is the only appropriate attitude. (National Haitong Telegraph, 29th)

[Berlin] The Deutsche Diplomatisch-Politische Korrespondenz published an article today commenting on Germany's decision to refuse to participate in the Beijing Conference. It first stated that Germany's desire to clarify the Far East situation and maintain international trade in the most satisfactory way is no less ardent than that of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. However, it pointed out that the reason Germany is unwilling to participate in the conference is that Germany is not a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty, and the conference was generated by a resolution of the League of Nations. It then mentioned that Germany's equal status in the Far East with the great powers after World War I has been stripped away. This action by the great powers clearly indicates that they no longer need their inherent unity, but now that difficulties are imminent, they welcome this kind of unity again. The newspaper concluded by saying that Germany's attitude of refusing to participate in the conference does not indicate that Germany disregards its humanitarian responsibilities. As long as an appropriate opportunity arises, it will do its best to assist in the peaceful resolution of the Far East dispute. (National Haitong Telegraph, 29th)

Says British and Japanese Are on the Verge of Conflict　Chamberlain Discusses with Cabinet Members

[London] Although Prime Minister Chamberlain is currently ill and resting at his country villa, he is still discussing the situation in Shanghai with cabinet members over the phone.

Resolution Passed at Meeting

[Tokyo] The informal organization known as the Current Affairs Discussion Group, composed of members of the Japanese House of Representatives and key figures in the industrial world, today passed a resolution advocating the immediate launch of a national movement to sever diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom. The resolution strongly attacked the attitude taken by the United Kingdom in the Sino-Japanese conflict, and the brewing of anti-British sentiment in Japan has become increasingly evident as a result. Today's meeting also passed a declaration stating that since the "China Incident" occurred, the United Kingdom has failed to maintain neutrality and that "the United Kingdom has openly adopted an arrogant and insulting attitude towards Japan and thoroughly assisted China in resisting Japan." It further pointed out that the United Kingdom is the central force behind instigating other countries to convene the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, "the purpose of which is clearly to provoke international intervention in the Chinese situation." The declaration solemnly stated, "Japan has always been faithful to the past Anglo-Japanese Alliance, but its endurance has now been exhausted. Therefore, Japan cannot allow the United Kingdom to continue its improper behavior without suffering damage, as this action will encourage China's spirit of resistance against Japan and promote cooperation between China and the Communist Party," thereby preventing and delaying the establishment of peace in East Asia. The declaration continued, "If the United Kingdom's improper attitude remains unchanged, we dare to declare that the friendly relations of the past sixty years really need to be discussed and severed." The meeting was held today at a certain club in Japan, with the participation of one hundred people, including members of Parliament, industrial magnates, military leaders, and educators.

### The World Should Not Condone Barbaric Acts

Herriot Reiterates Justice, French Radical Party Passes Political Program

⊙ Le Les, France. The National Congress of the Radical Socialist Party of France continued today. Senate President Herriot delivered a speech, stating that since the outbreak of war in both China and Spain, not only have soldiers been killed and wounded, but women and children have also been tragically murdered. These are savage acts of a barbaric era, and the countries of the world should not condone them. Herriot then discussed the Mediterranean issue, stating that if the work of the London Adjustment Committee fails, he believes Foreign Minister Delbos will be able to take the necessary measures to deal with it. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recently gave a speech in which he said that all of Europe would be fascist in the future. "As far as I know, at least one country in Europe will not be like this. There is a large country with a population of 200 million. It is unreasonable to try to isolate it. I hope that the Soviet Union can move towards a democratic system." Foreign Minister Delbos then spoke, explaining France's current foreign policy, stating that this policy is entirely based on the ideals of the Radical Socialist Party and the entire democratic nation, that is, what President Herriot has been practicing since 1924. In short, France's main goal is to maintain peace. "All reckless and weak actions should be avoided," because showing weakness to others can often lead to crises. France has promoted all past peace efforts, whether in Geneva, London, Nyon, or elsewhere. "Not only that, but France will also participate in the Nine-Power Treaty conference in Geneva to discuss the atrocities that have occurred in the Far East, which are unanimously condemned by just people around the world." France will not participate in any ideological groups. Although France knows that whether any agreement can be effective depends on whether the countries concerned respect their promises, it still does not hesitate to prepare to make friends with other countries and sign agreements. If not, barbarism will replace civilization. As for the principle of non-interference in the Spanish Civil War, France was the first to put forward this idea and is proud of it. In short, "Our country will never take any provocative actions towards other countries, but this compromise attitude should not be regarded as abandoning rights. It must be known that if France's dignity and security are threatened, we will never back down." Finally, Delbos expressed optimism about the future of the international situation, saying that so far, the crisis of world war has been avoided. If France can maintain its strength and remain united, the peace situation will not be broken. (Central News Agency 29th Havas Dispatch)

⊙ Le Les. French Finance Minister Pomaret gave a speech at the Radical Socialist Party conference today on France's financial position, stating that in a few days, a ship will arrive from New York carrying gold to France. The French Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas has gradually increased its gold reserves in recent months. The debt repayment fund can be reduced by the end of this year, and public debt can be reduced by 400 billion francs. In conclusion, he said that he believes that the next budget will be balanced.

⊙ Le Les. The National Congress of the Radical Socialist Party passed the draft resolution proposed by Congressman Caillaux this afternoon in order to end the diplomatic debate. The main points of the resolution are as follows: ㊀ France remains committed to all international obligations; ㊁ The party expresses its sympathy for the democratic system; ㊂ War has already broken out in a certain country in the world, and international peace, the security of French territories, and traffic on the Mediterranean Sea have all been threatened. France must resolutely protect the security of all territories; ㊃ France should strengthen cooperation with the United Kingdom and the United States; ㊄ Regarding the Spanish Civil War, the party believes that the policy of non-interference will not be able to continue unless all foreign volunteers are withdrawn.

⊙ Le Les. The National Congress of the Radical Socialist Party continued to meet here this morning to discuss colonial issues. It passed a resolution rejecting the return of Germany's pre-war colonies to Germany and asked the government to pay attention to the fact that if a certain great power occupies strategic military locations on the Mediterranean coast, it would be extremely dangerous for traffic between France and its North African colonies.

### Resolution on Spanish Question Passed

Recognition of Belligerent Status Issue, Soviet Attitude Remains Tough

[London] The subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee on the Spanish Civil War continued to meet at 5:30 PM today to discuss the draft resolution prepared by the subcommittee on the 26th of this month. The representatives of the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and Czechoslovakia accepted it without reservation. The representatives of Germany, Italy, and Portugal also expressed their approval, but on the condition that all other related countries also accept it. Only the Soviet representative continued to object to the issue of recognition of belligerent status. The subcommittee adjourned at 8:50 PM and scheduled a meeting for early next week to discuss the technical issues raised by the draft resolution. It is expected that the Adjustment Committee will hold a plenary meeting next Wednesday and entrust the United Kingdom to negotiate with both sides of the Spanish Civil War to urge them to accept the draft resolution. In the meantime, the Soviet Union may change its attitude so that the draft resolution can be established. Soviet representative Maisky said, "The current so-called non-intervention policy is unfair and useless. It only rewards aggressor countries. The Soviet Union can no longer bear responsibility for this policy. Therefore, the compromise proposal put forward by the United Kingdom on July 14 and the suggestions put forward by France on the 16th of this month based on the compromise proposal cannot be fully accepted by the Soviet Union. However, if the subcommittee adopts any secondary proposal that can indeed benefit the non-intervention system, the Soviet Union will be prepared to accept it." As for sections 3 and 4 of the subcommittee's draft resolution (namely, sending an international investigative team to Spain to investigate the number of foreign volunteers and study withdrawal methods, and restoring the monitoring of Spain's land and sea borders at the same time as the withdrawal of volunteers begins), the Soviet Union can accept it, but section 2 advocates that once a large number of volunteers have been withdrawn, the two sides in the Spanish Civil War will be recognized as belligerent parties. The Soviet government has always believed that the issue of recognizing belligerent status is completely unrelated to the withdrawal of volunteers and the issue of non-intervention. Therefore, he has been ordered to abstain from voting. Maisky concluded that the Soviet government reserves the right to make suggestions when the monitoring issue is submitted for discussion in the future. The purpose of these suggestions is to enhance the efficiency of the monitoring methods. German representative Ribbentrop said that the Soviet Union's attitude is equivalent to a firm refusal to recognize the two sides in the Spanish Civil War as belligerent parties, "which is a real threat to the Adjustment Committee and the European situation. Since the Soviet Union is unwilling to discuss the issue of recognizing belligerent status and refuses to pay for the monitoring methods, its actions are intended to delay the day. Is the Soviet Union willing to participate in the non-intervention system, or does it intend to openly intervene in the Spanish Civil War?" The chairman of the subcommittee and certain member states must advise the Soviet Union to comply. As for the situation caused by Maisky's speech today, he will report to the German government. (Central News Agency 29th Havas Dispatch)

[London] After the subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee on the Spanish Civil War continued to discuss the draft resolution yesterday, it immediately issued a communiqué stating that regarding the withdrawal of foreign volunteers, the recognition of belligerent status, and the restoration of monitoring methods, some of the methods contained in the British compromise plan have been accepted by the representatives of various countries. The representatives of various countries also agreed to authorize the chairman to contact both sides of the Spanish Civil War to obtain the assistance of both sides on the following issues:

㊀ Once the international investigative team goes to the country to investigate the number of foreign volunteers and studies the withdrawal methods with the country's authorities, and determines the withdrawal quotas of both sides, the warring parties must cooperate with it.

㊁ Notify the warring parties that the countries concerned will grant the warring parties certain belligerent rights within the scope and conditions stipulated in the British compromise plan. The scope of the British compromise plan is as follows: (A) The lists of prohibited goods drawn up by the warring parties should be completely the same as those drawn up by the Adjustment Committee; (B) The warring parties should allow ships carrying international inspectors and flying the flag of the Adjustment Committee to navigate freely without interference; (C) Ships of various countries do not sail to Spain, but the warring parties may not interfere with ships sailing close to the Spanish coast in certain areas. As for the conditions stipulated in the British compromise plan, once the Adjustment Committee confirms that the withdrawal methods of foreign volunteers have been carried out satisfactorily and have made substantial progress, the warring parties should be granted belligerent rights.)

㊂ Several days before the withdrawal of foreign volunteers begins, the Adjustment Committee will decide on a date to restore the land border monitoring methods between Portugal and Spain and between France and Spain, and strengthen the monitoring methods for ships of various countries. The countries concerned will also reaffirm that foreign volunteers and munitions are not allowed to cross the border into Spain. The representatives of the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Sweden, and Czechoslovakia have accepted the above-mentioned methods unconditionally. The representatives of Italy, Germany, and Russia delivered speeches separately. The representatives of various countries then decided to send the above-mentioned draft resolutions to their respective governments for review again so that a compromise could be reached on the 2nd of next month and a plenary meeting of the Adjustment Committee could be convened on the 3rd to make a decision. (Central News Agency 30th Havas Dispatch)

[London] Before the subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee met this afternoon, French Ambassador to the United Kingdom Corbin and British Foreign Secretary Eden had talks with Soviet Ambassador Maisky one after another, urging the Soviet Union to accept the proposal to recognize the two sides in the Spanish Civil War as belligerent parties. It is reported that if a large number of foreign volunteers can be withdrawn from Spain and all foreign pilots on both sides are withdrawn, the Soviet Union's attitude may change, and the compromise plan may be established. (Central News Agency 29th Havas Dispatch)

### Germany to Follow Italy in Levying Capital Tax

Schacht Resigns but Cancelled, Hitler's Intervention

[Berlin] Those in charge are currently considering levying a capital tax to pay for the four-year economic plan. It is reported that it will be stipulated that joint-stock companies will be taxed 10% of their total capital. (Central News Agency 30th Havas Dispatch)

[Berlin] According to official announcements here, the prices of certain daily necessities will be reduced starting from November 15. This step was proposed by the Price Commission, and its purpose is to increase the purchasing power of workers. It is claimed that the result of this decree will save consumers 100 million marks annually. The prices of items to be reduced include soap, washing powder, cosmetics, photographic equipment, medical supplies, and electrical materials, which will be reduced by 5% to 10%. Gasoline will be reduced by 6% to 12%, and other paper and metal products will be reduced by 5% to 15%. (30th National Telegraph Dispatch)

[Berlin] The rumors about Dr. Schacht resigning as Minister of Economics but remaining as President of the National Bank are still unclear. Official circles indicate that this claim was fabricated by rumor mongers. However, regardless of the truth of the matter, German leader Hitler seems to have personally presided over the issue yesterday and resolved the difficulties encountered by Dr. Schacht. Therefore, Schacht remains the Minister of Economics and President of the National Bank. It is reported that in recent days, it has been widely rumored that Schacht decided to resign due to the dissatisfaction of certain key figures in the National Socialist Party with his economic plan, and the reorganization of the Ministry of Economics has not yet been completed. Therefore, official circles have temporarily not announced Schacht's resignation. (Central News Agency 30th Reuter's Dispatch)

### 英法就敵軍砲擊斃英兵案進行嚴正交涉

英國當局親自前往視察 　 將舉行莊嚴葬禮

據申時社報導，前幾天，敵軍從蘇州河北岸陣地猛烈砲擊蘇州河南岸我方陣地，導致極司非爾路兆豐公園一帶越界築路區域流彈紛飛，死傷衆多無辜民衆。前晚七點半，有數枚砲彈落在英軍防地，造成三名英兵死亡，兩名英兵受傷。經查明，這三名身亡的英兵分別是梅龍，24歲；荷華特，26歲；施勃爾，23歲。現已將遺體移至萬國殯儀館，即將舉行莊嚴的葬禮。至於受傷的兩名士兵，分別是梅克雷和特雷賽，目前都在英軍醫院接受治療。事後，英國駐軍當局立即派員前往該地調查詳情。昨天上午，英國駐滬總領事費利浦以及駐華艦隊司令李爾等人，也親自前往該地勘察情況。據悉，該處駐軍原本共有七人，如今竟有五名死傷，僅有兩人倖免於難。

另外，據悉敵軍海軍當局對於上述事件強詞狡辯。英國艦隊司令親自拜訪日本出雲艦，告知其下午九時在防區內有砲彈落下，導致英兵死傷，並要求日方停止射擊。但敵方竟稱當日傍晚以後完全沒有射擊。日方更接到通知，稱法租界霞飛路也有砲彈落下，敵方則無言以對，詭辯稱該地超出日陸軍陣地的射程。目前，英國當局等已決定依據調查的確鑿證據，嚴正交涉。中央社報導，日本駐滬總領事岡本偕同海軍武官本田、陸軍武官原田及領事岡畸，昨天拜訪英國總領事費利浦、艦隊司令李德爾、陸軍司令司馬萊，就29日砲擊英兵事件表示歉意。據岡本稱，現已有詳細報告送達政府，並稱調查仍在進行中。英文大美晚報報導，昨日極司非爾區有三名英兵被砲彈炸死，另有數人受傷。今日中午，英國軍事當局會同中日代表徹查此案，以便决定應由何方負責。目前尚不能發表意見。據聞，調查事務由英防軍司令司馬萊特陸軍少將親自指導進行。日軍發言人今晨接見新聞記者時，極力否認當時日軍曾向華軍開砲。

### 租界西區領團防禦會集議英軍加建工事

凱旋路口新建堡壘一處 　　 敵機仍在附近飛繞轟炸

自戰事西移後，租界當局正加固西區一帶的防務，情況尚無變化。但自昨晚敵軍砲轟梵皇渡車站，竟波及白利南路，造成英駐軍及我平民多人死傷，故該處已陷入死寂之境。除英軍及警捕等在白利南路口駐防外，絕少行人。公共汽車也只到愚園坊附近就停止。記者今晨前往視察時，路經愚園路、億定盤路、海格路等地，英軍正加建工事，並有用水泥加固的。凱旋路口也新建一處堡壘。記者通過該處時，有敵機兩架由南向北飛行，還有一架由北向南飛行，後者飛行較低，在西南方向約一千公尺之處投下兩枚炸彈。記者不顧一切地到了梵皇渡車站，放眼望去，只有樹木茂盛，田野青翠，尚未受到倭寇的蹂躪。雖然聽到附近間斷的槍聲，也不覺得已身處戰火之中。回程經過兆豐公園，門庭冷落，遊人絕跡。其對面有一家小咖啡館，昨夜被敵軍砲擊中，門窗全毀，用木板遮擋，而台階前的玻璃碎片和木片還未清掃。

### 巨值春期絲繭紗交經紀人續認推銷海外

總數值達 　 八百萬元

今年巨額價值的春繭春絲，因均受戰事影響，現尚存儲於銀行。現已開始由生絲推銷會設法推銷出口，以利疏通資源。茲探錄其實况如下：

滯銷數量

江浙兩省未繅春繭約有二萬擔，春絲約七千餘擔。上述春繭、春絲，因今年上春開工的絲廠不多，故繅製延緩，以致未能於戰事以前行銷，殊堪惋惜。

議銷海外

上述春繭，計向江浙兩省銀錢業押款（每擔約十五元）約三百萬，春絲押款（每擔六百至七百元）約五百萬元，總計所做押款數值達八百萬元左右，資金流動上殊受影響。故生絲推銷會昨日特在滬召集江浙兩省絲繭商會議，討論推銷出口辦法。

定標準價

生絲推銷會方面特規定生絲標準價為每擔七百元，生絲勻度規定為七十八分。惟全體絲繭商則希望能增至七百五十元，因即以七百五十元價格，除去轉口稅費用，亦僅足償還銀行之押款，故尚在向推銷會要求之中，藉以維持商人的艱難，此事大致不久即可解決，則於靈活國際生絲貿易及資金流動均有重大裨益。

收成歉薄

至今年的秋繭收成極為不佳，蓋受氣候影響。即以浙省而論，繭統會自將秋期鮮繭委托絲廠代收代繅以來，當時向銀錢業押款計為八百五十萬，但迄至現在止，收繭用款僅用去三百八十萬，可見秋繭收成不及預計之半，蠶農均遭虧損。

開工寥寥

至於上述秋繭代收後，迄今未開繅，其原因實由戰事關係，致都市及沿鐵路絲廠均無法開工，（上海現在開工者祇有二家，）至於湖杭鄉鎮絲廠，則因燃煤缺乏，同時絹絲廠停止，相輔繅絲之蠶娥已難供應。至浙省蠶統會所定繅工，每擔祇有二十分、二十一勻度至八十一分勻度，祇有八十元的標準，絲廠認為太低，深恐虧損，此亦為一重大原因。

### 紗交經紀人續認救國公債

國光中學師生 　 分隊出發勸募

本市紗布交易所經紀人公會全體同人，對救國公債的認購非常踴躍。前已向市民勸募總隊第一特區組報告認購數目兩次，計七萬六千餘元。據悉該會同人中續有認購，計長豐榮記五千七百六十元、長和二千四百元、源興一千六百元、晋康一千六百元、同昌一千三百元、新昶一千四百元、陳瑞生一千一百二十元、聚興一千元、恒昌九百六十元、生源八百元，共續認一萬六千九百四十元，連同之前該會同人認購公債，已近十萬元。又本市國光中學師生，近鑒於救國公債之重要，爰於今日起利用休閒時間，共分十二小隊出發勸募，其勸募手續係勸導各界熱心人士填寫認購書，由認購人向指定銀行交款，對於現金及物品絕不直接收受。

### 前綫需要大量篷車

前綫現需要數十輛篷車，（即夏季遊覽車，該項車輛行駛迅速，煞車靈活，可察看各方情形，進出自如）希望各方面人士將此夏季遊覽日備車，在此秋冬之交捐輸前方，如需代價，亦可與軍事當局接洽。

### 弔閘北戰場

— 寄萍

（本報特寫：從上海特區到吳淞、寶山、劉行、羅店、南翔、江灣、閘北等地，遠的四五十里，近的不上半里路，在平時大家來去自由，瞬息可達；然自“八一三”以來，除我們新聞記者不常實地觀察外，一般人早已視為禁地，惟有心嚮往之。所以對這些地方被敵人蹂躪到怎樣田地？被碎成如何景象？簡直是個“謎”了。不講遠的，就說閘北吧，從蘇州河崖至大通巷，寶山路口，麥根路站，這區域内的形形色色，已很够我們深深體味了！昨我曾訪問了一位參與閘北抗戰的×長，說起這位戰士，精神眞值得佩服，到現在還留守閘北一塊地，準備灑最後一滴血，弭頑寇週旋到底，我們談的時間並不長，但是有些材料可以解答這個“謎”的。　　　“有人說此番閘北大火，是我軍掩護退卻的策略，也有人說是敵人焦土政策的手段，究竟眞　如何？我鄭重的問他徵答。”

他聽了我這問話，語氣很沉重的說：“當然是敵人慘酷惡辣的毒計，在廿六日夜晚十時，我軍奉令撤退，立刻準備移動，除我們這部隊擔任掩護外，其餘依次後退，秩序非常嚴肅，至翌晨四時半，我閘北方面已撤退完畢，敵人於六時半開入開北，而大火是七時半攙發生的，依時間推算，便可證明。你想：閘北究是我們的閘北，有如此鉅資的資源，我們怎肯燬滅自己的財產？敵人的心理，總是想削減我們的生命財産，如目地一把火，可以根本肅清我們的部隊，比什麽也來得爽快，所以有常識的人一定會理解的。反正這麽來，閘北是焦土了，什麽地方維持會等漢奸醜態，也不能　形，倒是一件好事。”

“這兩個半月之中，敵機每日轟炸，投彈在四五千以上，我方工事及戰士損害的情形如何？”

“我們絕對不怕轟炸，在陣地上始終沒重大損失、不過燬壞些民房，像兩路局四周，炸得全是窟窿，而屋頂祇中了幾顆小型炸彈，從頂至四層，稍有爆炸，下四層若無其事。記得有一天，敵機一架，盤桓於北站上空，最後五分鐘内，投二千磅　炸彈一枚，着地時四周電線震斷，路起裂痕，管理大厦，左右擺動，宛如地震，幸而投擲不凖，落在寶山路汽車站，穿成丈餘周圍之巨穴，彈　露出路面三四尺，如果爆炸必成巨災。敵機在閘北不敢低飛，我防空部隊偶爾射擊，前後擊落兩架。”

“記得九月十四及二十一兩晚，北四川路方面槍砲齊發，聲如連珠，是不是我軍所施的威力？”

那兩晚是我軍總反攻，我們只聽得一聲砲響，便開始行動，把各式武器，齊活動起來，如輕機槍，重機槍，手榴彈，迫擊砲，小鋼砲等，約模在一小時之內，不停的向敵人厮殺，終於把敵人打得落花流水，狼狽而逃。

後來我向他　於留守閘北部隊的前因後果、他說這些軍機恕我不能評答，所可奉告的道次死守，上有長官密令。下有全體將士誓死守土的决心：纔有此舍身衛國的表示。”

這幾件事實出諸於可愛的戰士之口，彌覺珍貴，故拉雜寫來，聊國讀各之參考。

時評

### 比京會議與我國的運命

— 宜

比京會議就要開幕了。大家所關心的問題是這個會議是否會產生於我國有利的結果。

據蘇聯消息報說：“倫敦會議早經證明僅與侵略者的目的相符。故對於此次比京會議。吾人實亦難妄想能有更佳的結果。”的確。比京會議之不會產生怎樣美滿的結果。從召集的方式上。就可以窺知一二了。不過我們也不能否認。目前我國的國際友人比日本要多。只要在外交上好好的努力。這個會議的機會當然很值得利用。而且蘇聯及美國在這個會議上可能發生的主導作用。我們也是不能輕經看過的。

總之。在比京會議開幕以前。我們對於這個會議。固然不能有什么奢望。但也不能不加以密切的注意。要知道國際關係是複雜而變動的。我國如果堅守自己的立場。在這個重要會議中間。隨機應變地盡着外交的努力。一定多少有成效可言。卽使外交的努力不能使這個會議產生好的結果。我們也不必悲觀與失望。因為民族的運命。完全寄托在自身的奮鬥。比如蘇聯土耳其兩國。在革命時期。所處的國際環境。比我們現在要壞多少。可是奮鬥的成功。終于打破不利的國際環境了。現在决定着我國的運命的當然也只是奮鬥。只是抗戰。無論國際環境怎樣。我們的抗戰意志絲毫不鬆懈。我國的前途總是光明的。

### The Korean Independence Movement Group Requests the Nine-Power Conference to Punish Japan with Military Force

Empty Words on Paper Cannot Guarantee Korean Territory; Only an Inch of Blood and Flesh Can Recover an Inch of Land and Protect the Balance of Power in the Far East.  Hopes for the Immediate Launch of Military Force.

The Joint Propaganda Committee of the Korean Independence Movement Group yesterday telegraphed the Chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, requesting effective sanctions against Japan's aggression in the Far East.  To the Esteemed Chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, We humbly believe that your esteemed conference, for the sake of the safety and peace of the nations of the Far East, especially for the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and administrative unity of China, has provided protection and guarantees, and has long been a wellspring of historical international justice.  This time, to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute, you have reconvened, invigorated your authority, and a new situation in the Far East is about to unfold.  Our association, on behalf of our 23 million people, sincerely extends our congratulations.  Japan is a public enemy of humanity and a habitual violator of international treaties.  It first forcibly occupied Korea, the peaceful cornerstone of our Far East, as a bridgehead for its advance into the mainland.  Subsequently, it has been eager to completely expel the power and interests of European and American powers from the entire Far East and the Pacific Ocean.  Its strategic advancement is roughly divided into four stages: the annexation of Korea on August 29, 1910, was the first step; the forcible occupation of Manchuria on September 18, 1931, was the second step; the invasion of China with its entire national military force, including the navy, army, and air force, since July of this year, is the third step; and once the third step is successful, it will successively invade Siberia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Indochina, the South Sea Islands, the Philippines, and Java as the fourth step.  This is the traditional ultimate goal of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters.  Your esteemed conference has long seen through this point and should not allow the bankruptcy of the Far East and the conquest of China to occur.  However, if the outcome of the conference is limited to peaceful means or economic sanctions, Japan's bestial behavior cannot be stopped.  Our 23 million Korean revolutionary troops and China's 500 million armed people have long been closely linked, with a unified will like a fortress.  We vow not to stop our joint resistance until our homeland is completely restored.  Empty treaties on paper have not been able to guarantee the territory of Korea.  We have long tasted the bitterness of this. Therefore, we believe that an inch of blood and flesh is the only way to recover an inch of land.  The revolutionary forces accumulated and brewed within Korea over the past decades, and the national independence movement fronts distributed abroad, have been completed.  Mass uprisings and battles by armed forces will erupt imminently.  We believe that peace in the Far East cannot be maintained until China and Korea have fought to a decisive victory.  To complete the autonomy and independence of Korea, to protect the territory of China, to protect the right to survival of the 2 million Korean residents currently in Manchuria, for the free development of our friendly nation of China, and to uphold the eternal peace and balance of power of the Far East, we, as a nation of the Far East, offer our opinions on resolving the Far East dispute to your esteemed conference, which holds the only key to resolving the Far East problem.  We humbly request that effective sanctions be implemented, that is, by launching military force to punish the thieving Japan, and that assistance be urgently provided for the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty and the completion of Korea's independence and autonomy, thereby establishing eternal peace in the East.

### Dai Baoliu's Radio Speech

The Japanese Side Uses Anti-Communism as an Excuse; Dai Bitterly Refutes It

Dr. Dai Baoliu, Secretary-General of the International Problems Research Association, gave a radio speech last night refuting the Japanese invasion. He first stated that Japanese warlords have been openly promoting their continental policy in recent years, often taking advantage of the fear of communization in certain European and Western countries, wantonly slandering, and spreading malicious propaganda, using anti-communism as an excuse to invade our country. Yesterday, the Tokyo Foreign Ministry refused to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and issued a declaration involving the so-called anti-communism problem, reversing right and wrong and confusing international opinion, which should be resented by those with knowledge. He then stated that since the founding of the Republic of China, political and economic progress has been rapid, and the Japanese have used our opportunity to suppress communism to promote various conspiracies for development on the mainland. For example, the military suppression of communism in 1931 could have ended earlier, but the Japanese forcibly occupied the Northeast to prevent the development of the Central Army. Recently, the Japanese conspiracy to encompass North China has become increasingly evident. The Communists, feeling that the country will be destroyed soon, resolutely abolished the Soviet area, dissolved the Red Army organization, and obeyed the Three Principles of the People. At the same time, they are making the greatest contribution to resisting the Japanese invasion. Therefore, there is no so-called communist force in China today. The Japanese malicious slander is not recognized by those with knowledge and ridiculed by them. Moreover, according to the Japanese themselves, there was absolutely no communist force in the four northeastern provinces before the Shenyang Incident, but the situation today is completely different. According to Japanese newspapers, the expansion of communist forces in the Northeast in recent years is alarming and has become a major problem for the puppet organization. Japanese military violence not only cannot prevent the influence of communism but is even the source of communism. Finally, he stated that our country's economic policy has always been based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood. As for how to implement concrete plans, it is a matter of our internal affairs and does not allow interference from other countries. The people of our country have the freedom to choose socialism or capitalism. What does it have to do with the Japanese? The Japanese violent military invasion cannot be used as an excuse.

### The Municipal Coal Committee Controls Coal

Flags, Licenses for Vehicles and Ships are Unified Under the Management of Associations

The Municipal Coal Consumption Management Committee has been established in compliance with orders to handle all coal control matters in this city. It is reported that the committee has ordered the coal industry, mechanized coal ball industry, and other trade associations in this city to implement control in accordance with all the regulations of the committee and has submitted a request to the Military Affairs Commission to order the Songhu Garrison Headquarters that all flag licenses and control matters related to coal transportation in this city shall be handled by the committee to unify authority and facilitate progress. From now on, all flag licenses, vehicles, and ships used for coal transportation will be managed by the committee.

### The War Zone Refugee Relief Association Relieves Refugees in West Shanghai

All shelters are full; those awaiting relief continue to arrive in an endless stream; hoping all sectors will allocate funds to set up shelters

The Municipal War Zone Refugee Relief Committee reported that since our army moved to the new defense line, residents along the north bank of the Suzhou Creek have lost their support and have fled south, gathering in the area of Great West Road, Brennan Road, and Triumph Road awaiting relief. Upon hearing the report, the committee immediately dispatched the director of the shelter group, along with all staff, to provide relief. They also risked going to the war zone area of Zhoujiaqiao to rescue more than 50 refugees, who were gradually sent to various shelters for supplies by the committee, now totaling more than 4,500 people. The Red Swastika Society rescue team also set off for the front line with stretcher teams, rescuing 13 wounded soldiers in the Hongqiao Road area and sending them to the committee's hospital for treatment. The team also rescued more than 130 refugees from Beixinjing, Zhoujiaqiao, and other places, escaping from danger and sending them into the concession. In addition to some who went to relatives and friends, the rest were sent to various shelters. However, all shelters are now full, and those awaiting relief continue to arrive in an endless stream. It is hoped that all sectors will provide relief quickly. Allocating funds to set up additional shelters is especially welcome.

### Foreign Merchants' Remittance Drafts are Smooth

Foreign Merchants Deposit Remittance Funds in the Bank of China, Approximately One Million Yuan at an Annual Interest Rate of Two Percent

Since the foreign banks, HSBC and Mercantile Bank, opened remittance accounts at the Bank of China, foreign merchants have been able to receive and accept remittance drafts as usual. Therefore, among foreign merchants, remittance drafts can still circulate smoothly without obstruction, but there is still a discount of one percent of the face value of the draft. According to reliable information obtained by the Xin Xin News reporter from financial circles, the amount of remittance funds from foreign banks in August was approximately one million yuan. Recently, it is also around one million yuan. The Bank of China pays interest at an annual rate of two percent.

### Various Comfort Goods are Urgently Needed at the Front

The Shanghai Comfort Committee has been entrusted by various armies to collect a large number of sacks, barbed wire, motorcycles, bicycles, first aid kits, cotton vests, etc. It is hoped that all sectors will donate continuously for application. For the new style of cotton vests, you can write to the Shanghai Comfort Committee on Yu Qiaqing Road to obtain them. Those who donate more than 500 pieces can obtain a piece of national hero cloth to sew inside as a souvenir.

### Stamp Duty Application During Extraordinary Times

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Compiles and Prints a Table for Reference and All Tariff Rules for Transit Tax

Since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the Provisional Measures for Collecting Stamp Duty During Extraordinary Times on the 11th of this month, the method of affixing stamp duty is different from the rate table attached to the previous Stamp Duty Law. Now, for the convenience of merchants to check, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has specially compiled the Table for Reference of Stamp Duty Application During Extraordinary Times and published it in the Special Issue No. 4 of the Commercial Monthly Report. The issue also prints all tariff rules for transit tax for various industries to check.

Commentary

### Long-Term Resistance and People's Livelihood

— Sun Huairen

The Nine-Power Treaty Conference will soon be held in this capital. How the conference will turn out, we naturally have no way of knowing for sure at the moment, but judging from the general situation, a portion of the participating nations seem to want to try hard to get China and Japan to peacefully resolve the current war situation in this conference, which is quite obvious. However, is there any possibility of realizing this kind of mediation attempt? Judging from our common sense, the possibility may not be very great. We know that our resistance war this time is fundamentally in a passive position. If Japan can not infringe on our sovereignty, can completely withdraw its troops stationed in China, and can hand over the four northeastern provinces to me, we may not be able to cease fire. However, the facts show that this is impossible. Japan's rampant behavior everywhere this time, disregarding the Nine-Power Treaty, and refusing to participate in the conference are all no different from indicating that it will not repent and stop until it has achieved the ultimate goal of aggression. These situations, on the one hand, will make the attempt of this Nine-Power Treaty Conference equal to zero, and at the same time, on the other hand, it also shows that our resistance war this time can never be stopped. Moreover, in fact, since our resistance war this time has already begun, the future result will not matter whether it is a victory or a defeat, but it must not be interrupted halfway without any gain or with a loss. Therefore, the determination of long-term resistance cannot be abandoned from beginning to end. Especially in the current situation on the day when the Nine-Power Treaty is about to begin, this determination should be insisted on unremittingly.

However, in reality, so-called long-term resistance is not enough to have determination alone, it is even more necessary to create an environment for long-term resistance. "Chinese people must resist Japanese aggression in order to have a way to live," other than the traitors who are willing to work for the tiger, I think every citizen thinks so, but just thinking is useless, it must be able to be put into practice to produce an effect. According to the experience of the three months of resistance, it is very painful that traitors are found everywhere, setting off rockets, sending signals, and acting as spies, they have done almost everything bad. When these traitors are caught and asked why they want to be traitors, they are almost all for money and life. Recently, in many news reports from the front lines, or in narrations from friends from the front lines, the reason why traitors are as numerous as cows is almost all pointed out as the general poverty of people's lives. Even if these people sincerely want to resist Japan in their conscience, their lives force them to undermine the resistance. Therefore, if we want long-term resistance, and we want to make the resistance smooth, then we should pay special attention to the livelihood of the people at the bottom of society. In other words, we must make the people at the bottom of society have the opportunity to survive in wartime as much as possible.

The above is only discussed in terms of the lower class of society. In fact, the livelihood of the middle class people also needs to be paid attention to. These people are still educated in peacetime, so they will not become traitors for the time being, and to be honest, the people who can support the resistance the most now can also be said to be this level of people. Therefore, for long-term resistance, their livelihood must also be guaranteed, otherwise, even if they will not become traitors after they have difficulty in life, they are prone to producing a kind of war-weariness mentality. A war-weariness mentality towards long-term resistance can be said to be as dangerous as undermining resistance.

Summarizing the above, we can summarize it like this: Now that we want long-term resistance, it is no longer allowed to have doubts, but in order to make long-term resistance possible, we must always pay attention to the people's livelihood, so that all factors that can undermine resistance will be eliminated.

### The Enemy Army Attempts to Seize Postage Stamp Printing Plates to Disrupt Our Entire Postal Service

Inevitable Brewing of Unfortunate International Incident; The North-China Daily News Editorial Believes It a "Major Error"

The North-China Daily News published an editorial yesterday, entitled "Major Error," which stated that the Superintendent of Postage Stamp Printing at the General Post Office, Mr. Thomaier, was arrested by the Japanese military authorities in the Legation Quarter of Beijing and ordered to hand over various postage stamp printing plates. He is currently still in custody. Because Mr. Thomaier refused, he was subjected to torture. This matter has aroused great public indignation. The magnitude of this crime by the Japanese authorities is very clear, because if they obtain this plate, they can use it to print in large quantities and sell it widely, greatly damaging China's postal revenue, and even temporarily completely disrupting China's entire postal service. In wartime, any country can do its utmost to harm the enemy country. Confiscating postage stamp printing plates may be regarded as an appropriate act of war, but the Japanese government insists that its actions in China are not a recognized state of hostility. Therefore, its current actions constitute a criminal offense, because without the permission of the Chinese government, unauthorized printing of postage stamps, even if from the original plate, is no different from counterfeiting. The Japanese authorities seem to have done this because the establishment of the North China Autonomous Region requires this item. There is no doubt about the Japanese's future plans. This kind of counterfeit mail, if it does not have the right to mail without stamps recognized by the Postal Union, if Japanese stamps are sold in North China, it is tantamount to declaring that Japan holds sovereignty over North China, because actually the place is going to be developed for Japanese postal service. Japan encountered difficulties in this matter after forcibly occupying Manchuria, so it attempted to seize the printing plates to avoid encountering the previous difficulties again. However, this time it may be difficult to negotiate a solution like last time. Judging from the current state of world opinion, once this new autonomous region is established, this partial recognition may not be as easy to solve as last time. (The following advises the Japanese authorities to release Mr. Thomaier quickly, which can at least mitigate the condemnation from all parties, and that the printing plates are not in Mr. Thomaier's custody and are now stored in a certain foreign bank, and the Japanese cannot obtain them without causing another unfortunate international incident. The Japanese have already caused many unfortunate international incidents, how can they add another one? The text is omitted).

### Students Going to the United States Arrive in the United States

Hu Zuyin, a member of the student delegation on the Lincoln liner bound for the United States this year, wrote to Zhu Shaoping of the Global Student Association yesterday, saying that Hu Zuyin and others departed from Shanghai on the Sphinx liner on September 4 and transferred to the Lincoln liner in Hong Kong to come to the United States. They did not land at either Singapore or Honolulu. When passing Honolulu, they were received by Consul General Mei. They arrived safely in San Francisco on the 28th. The next morning, they took trains to various schools. Everything was safe and comforting along the way. Those on the same ship were Chen Shidun, Chen Gongyu, Qiu Zhiyun, Tu Ningyi, Xu Zhenyuan, Hu Kai, Hu Zuyin, Hui Lianjia, Lin Handa, Shen Kui, Shen Jinzhen, Tan Yi, Tao Shaoyuan, Qian Qipeng, Wang Yujing, Wu Shanyang, and Xu Ren, totaling seventeen people.

### Performing Arts Circles Broadcast to Raise Refugee Relief Donations

The Shanghai Performing Arts Circles Relief Association and the Shanghai Branch of the Extraordinary Period Refugee Relief Committee are organizing a joint broadcast to raise donations for refugee relief from November 1st to 5th at the Oriental Hotel and Oriental Radio Station on Yu Qiaqing Road. Because of the large number of refugees from Zhabei, Jiangwan, and other areas who have fled into the concessions, men, women, old and young are crying for hunger and cold, and the situation is extremely tragic. The work of refugee relief has become more serious, and funds are urgently needed. A large-scale fundraising is necessary. Every day from 1:00 PM to 3:30 PM and from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM, more than 100 actors from the entire performing arts circles of the city, including Zhang Ye'er, Yi Fangshuo, and Liu Chunshan, will speak for the refugees in front of the broadcast microphone.

### The People's Sanatorium Provides Free Consultations for Poor Women

The People's Sanatorium at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Chongqing Road has been established by the famous doctor Yang Zhongfu for many years. The medical affairs are busy, and the equipment is comprehensive. Previously, it was handling the rescue of wounded soldiers and had no time for consultations. Now it has temporarily ended and will resume its old state of outpatient and inpatient services. Considering the large number of poor pregnant women, the hospital has specially hired female doctor Wang Huizhen to specialize in obstetrics, providing benefits to poor women without calculating the cost.

### The Medical and Pharmaceutical Circles Salvation Association Provides Free Consultations and Medicine

The Chinese Medical and Pharmaceutical Circles Salvation Association, seeing the extreme suffering of sick refugees, has dispatched members to shelters to provide free consultations and medicine to provide relief. For the sake of popularization, it has also established a clinic at No. 23 Zhenpingli, Songshan Road intersection, Carter Road, where it will provide medical treatment from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day. Refugees from various shelters can go for medical treatment and receive free medicine from the association.

### Qin Guoding Beaten to Death by Passersby

Qin Guoding, a technician at the architect's office of the Municipal Central District Construction Committee, was walking with a friend, Duan, on the morning of October 29th, passing the intersection of Xinzha Road and Wenzhou Road. At that time, a large crowd was watching our heroic isolated force fighting in the Sihang Warehouse. Suddenly, some citizens mistakenly identified Qin and Duan as traitors. The two immediately produced identification documents to show the crowd. Duan was spared from being beaten because he held his certificate in hand, but Qin's employee certificate, which had his photo on it, was passed around among the crowd. Soon, it disappeared. Those who came later began to beat him, and the crowd joined in. The police were unable to stop it, and he was beaten to death on the spot. It is reported that Qin was from Liaoning, 31 years old, and lived at 16 Rue Paul Beau in the French Concession. He had studied architecture in Germany and returned to China. Because the Northeast had fallen, he had no home to return to and took a job in Shanghai. As a lonely guest in a foreign land, he always felt a strong antipathy toward the enemy. He was indeed a promising young man. Now, he has lost his life under the false accusation of being a traitor. This is not only a tragedy for Qin but also a loss of talent. The public must be more careful and abide by order to avoid making wrongful accusations. It is also reported that after Qin Guoding was beaten and injured, he was rushed to Baolong Hospital by police car, but he died before arriving at the hospital. His body was transferred from the Xinzha Police Station to the coroner's office. This morning, Song Genshan, a prosecutor from the First Special Court, and forensic doctor Zhang Yan arrived to examine the body and ordered it to be prepared for burial.

### Household Goods Trading Society

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, all our compatriots have wanted to save money and donate to the country. To facilitate its members and save on household expenses, the Women's Christian Temperance Union has established a small-scale household goods trading society. Anyone who wants to sell used clothing, used household goods, and homemade household items at a lower price (not exceeding 50 yuan) can have the society sell them on their behalf. Those who want to buy household goods at a low price are welcome to view the goods as soon as possible. Details can be found in the by-laws of the Household Goods Trading Society, located at 999 Jing'an Temple Road.

### Guangyuan Preserved Meat Shop Offers Free Preserved Meat

Guangyuan, located near Avenue Edward VII and Park Road, is a famous preserved meat shop in Shanghai. Its products, such as preserved duck, preserved sausage, and preserved meat, are of excellent quality and are made by renowned chefs, making them delicious and popular with diners. Its added selection of roasted and braised foods is also considered excellent side dishes. During this extraordinary period, for the benefit of the greater cause, for every pound of preserved sausage purchased, half a pound of preserved meat will be given away (proportional for other amounts), so that everyone can enjoy the delicious taste, and those managing household expenses can save a little.

### Enemy General Masaki Jinzaburo

— Zang

The enemy has been invading Shanghai for almost three months. The commander-in-chief of the enemy forces, General Iwane Matsui, has requested reinforcements from Tokyo six times and launched five general offensives. The result so far is that 50,000 to 60,000 soldiers have died and 700 million yuan of military expenses have been wasted. This has greatly dissatisfied the military authorities. Rumor has it that the military authorities have transferred Matsui back and sent Masaki Jinzaburo, a military councillor, to Shanghai to take command. What kind of person is Masaki? He is from Saga Prefecture and, along with former Chief of the Army Technical Department Major General Ogata Katsuiichi and former Vice Minister of the Army Lieutenant General Yanagawa Heisuke, was the leader of the Saga military clique and the leader of the fascist young officers. During the Russo-Japanese War, he served as the company commander (transportation chief) of the 46th Infantry Regiment (regiment) with the rank of captain. After the war, he studied at the Army University. In 1907, he graduated with Araki Sadao (former Minister of the Army), Abe Nobuyuki (former commander of the Taiwan Army), Sumisawa Jun, Haraguchi Hatsutaro, and others. Later, he went to Germany and, upon his return, was promoted to battalion commander (battalion commander) of the 42nd Infantry Regiment. In 1917, he became the chief of the Second Section of the Directorate General of Military Education. Soon after, he served as the chief of the Military Affairs Section of the Ministry of the Army, the commander (regiment commander) of the 1st Guards Infantry Regiment, the chief of the undergraduate course at the Military Academy, and the director of the teaching department. In 1931, he was promoted to the president of the Military Academy. This was the period when he cultivated his influence. Later, he was promoted to the commander of the 8th Division (commander). During the cabinet of Kazushige Ugaki, he was appointed as the commander of the Taiwan Army. At this time, the Manchurian Incident occurred. He gained the favor of Prince Kan'in Kotohito, the Chief of the General Staff, and was summoned to Miyakezaka, where he became the Vice Chief of the General Staff. Later, because he offered cunning plans for the invasion of Manchuria, during the January 28 Incident in Shanghai, he contributed the strategy of encircling the rear from Liuhang, which was highly praised by the military authorities, and he was promoted to general. During the era of Araki's army, due to their close relationship, he was appointed as the Director General of Military Education. He is very cunning in nature, fond of alcohol, and always gets very drunk. He looks down on everyone and often despises the ministers in the parliament. He is also very ambitious. When he was the president of the Military Academy, he often incited students to oppose the liberal faction and advocated governing the country with fascism. He even considered himself as Saigo Takamori, who died in the Siege of Shiroyama, and was therefore trusted by young officers, who regarded him as the leader of fascism. However, the control faction within the military authorities regarded him as a dangerous figure, and after the May 15 Incident, he was transferred to the position of military councillor.

On the night of the May 15 Incident, when Masaki was the Vice Chief of the General Staff, a large group of young officers heard that they had entered the official residence of the Minister of the Army. He was discussing with Minister of the Army Araki about the inappropriateness of the liberal faction and the Seiyukai. Hearing that the young officers were coming in droves, he pretended not to know that the incident had occurred. At that time, Mori Kaku, an elder of the Seiyukai, was one of the most ardent opponents of fascism. He held the deepest grudge against him. To vent his anger, he immediately summoned Mori Kaku to his private residence and scolded him severely. Mori Kaku was unarmed and endured the insult without daring to answer. At the same time, he incited the young officers to launch an armed riot. As a result, Tsuyoshi Inukai and Mori Kaku were brutally murdered. Inukai Tsuyoshi had always been committed to upholding constitutionalism, and Mori Kaku was Inukai's most trusted protégé, serving as the Chief Cabinet Secretary. Mori and Inukai's constitutional spirit opposed the army's tyranny and rejected fascism. Their deaths can be said to be due to Masaki's initiative, and it can also be said to be a major conflict between fascism and liberalism.

Masaki's influence began around four or five years before and after the Great Kanto Earthquake, which was during his time as the president of the Army Military Academy. About 4,000 young officers graduated under him. These 4,000 are all the backbone of today's army, so Masaki's influence can be said to surpass all parties in the military authorities. When he was at the Military Academy, because the students' thoughts were divided into left and right wings, internal conflicts often occurred. Masaki specialized in advocating Emperor worship and Japanism, and the left wing was gradually suppressed. Therefore, his opinions on politics, diplomacy, and national defense advocated defending against Russia and invading China externally, and internally advocated using violence to destroy parliamentary politics, hinder the unity of political parties, overthrow veteran ministers, and create a fascist dictatorship.

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, Japan has suffered losses in troops and generals, and has been at a loss. Not only has there been conflict between the navy and army over responsibility issues, but also fierce undercurrents have arisen within the army. Masaki, as the leader of the young fascist faction, has the potential to control young officers. The military authorities have transferred him to Shanghai to supervise the war for this reason.

### Five Days and Nights on the Suzhou Creek

— Ximin

At around 10:00 AM on October 20th, when the turbid tide water in the Huangpu River flowed into the Suzhou Creek, the sailboat we were on set off from the Old Garbage Bridge and sailed west.

A Suzhou Creek divides two worlds. On the north side of the river is a symphony of cannon fire and exploding bombs, while on the south side of the river, it is still bustling and full of the noisy city sounds of peacetime. The silver bombs dropped from enemy planes clearly swayed in the air, followed by huge explosions. A thick black smoke billowed up, followed by mud, sand, and scraps of paper flying into the sky above the river, and falling on us. Our boat happened to be traveling on the dividing line between heaven and hell.

After the boat passed Caojiadu, we all felt a little nervous. Because beyond that point, both sides of the Suzhou Creek are our territory, and enemy planes can carry out slaughter without restraint. Considering the safety of people and boats, the boatmen rowed out of the dangerous areas of Yujidun and Beixinjing overnight. A bright autumn moon and a string of gunshots sent us west, breaking the silence of the night. There were more and more sunken ships destroyed by enemy planes along the way. I stood at the bow of the boat, gazing at those sacrifices half-floating on the water. The night wind blew, a little cold, and a surge of thoughts rose in my heart.

By the time dawn broke the next day, the boat had already passed Beixinjing, and the river water was not as turbid as near Shanghai. A gentle breeze rippled the green waves, and the morning sun shone on both banks. Golden rice fields swayed. Wild birds sang from time to time. It was a good harvest year. I stood on the boat, looking at a field of rice waiting for the farmers to harvest, enjoying the fresh morning breeze and the melodious bird song. I felt very happy. This beautiful natural scene is something that people who have lived in Shanghai for a long time cannot enjoy. After two months of living a tense and rigid life in the air of war, suddenly changing to such a gentle and peaceful environment, I couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief. However, although the autumn fields of Jiangnan attracted us, who had been living in the city for too long, the whirring sound of airplanes flying overhead broke the beautiful scene early in the morning. The many tragic scenes of sunken ships I had seen last night involuntarily湧up into my mind. Fear tightly gripped my chest, and my uneasy mood followed the teams of enemy planes coming and going.

It is true that Japanese soldiers like to make trouble with our common people. As the sailboat approached the stone bridge of Huangdu, two enemy planes were showing off their skills in the town of Huangdu, which was very close to us. The enemy planes could fly low and circle freely over this unarmed town. The planes made strange noises, and then swooped down, flying so low that they could almost touch the mast of the boat. They dropped two bombs in a row before veering away. At this time, the pitiful rice-carrying sailboat in front of us was sacrificed under the bombs. In this situation, we had no choice but to dock the boat and hide in the cotton fields on the shore.

After the enemy planes finished their work of slaughtering the people and their flying work, we strolled into the town. The lingering fear of the people in the town still remained on everyone's faces and had not dissipated. An old woman, holding a small grandson in her left hand and shielding her forehead from the sun with her right hand, stretched her neck and looked up at the sky. Her hunched posture and terrified face aroused my infinite sadness. The crew of the bombed rice boat were not killed because they jumped into the water early. They squatted by the river, all wet, looking at the remains of the boat that was their lifeline, with unspeakable grief on their faces. The word "humanity" seems to have no shadow in the enemy's vocabulary.

From Huangdu westward, the scenery along the way is still beautiful and moving. However, there were more and more boats along both sides of the river. The five boats of books from the Zhonghua Book Company were blown into pieces by enemy planes, and many small steamships were also bombed. The bodies of passengers who died under the bombs and machine guns of enemy planes floated along the water from time to time, passing by our boat. There were old women, old men, and children. Their pale faces were still exposed on the surface of the water. Their children, their parents, were probably still thinking about them, looking forward to their elderly parents and children returning home, right? Even if there are no parents, who has no children? Human society will eventually produce such bloody beasts. This is truly a disgrace to humanity.

The small towns along the way are mostly clustered by the water. And the largest shop in the town must be a rice mill, which shows how rich the grain production in Jiangnan is. When the boat docked, I always liked to wander around the town for a while, silently observing the reactions of the residents in this area near the war zone and the dynamics of the national salvation work. However, I was very disappointed. In every town, we never saw any slogans or cartoons related to national salvation. The villagers were also indifferent to current affairs. There were no bulletin boards. It was very remarkable to find one Shanghai newspaper in a large town. Fortunately, the enemy planes threatened them from time to time, making them feel the cruelty of the enemy in peaceful villages. However, the response they gave to this living material was sadness exceeding indignation. They were indeed still living a muddled life. "The decline of the people's spirit" is the most painful thing. But whose fault is this?

Every day, under the threat of enemy planes, sitting in this fifteenth-century means of transportation, we traveled west, again and again, avoiding several dangers, and finally arrived in this ancient Suzhou. Suzhou is paradise on earth, but under the moon it is precisely hell on earth. Enemy planes attack several times a day. About half the time of the day, some of the people of Suzhou are spending it in cellars. The market is particularly depressed, and the faces of the people of Suzhou are anemic, yellow and somewhat dull.

Suzhou is an important rear area. Although some support work has been done for the people, it is not always satisfactory. Some people say that the work spirit of the support association is "not seeking merit, but seeking no fault." Perhaps this is not just the case in Suzhou alone. Now is the time to mobilize all the people to participate in the great national liberation war. We hope that the leaders of Suzhou's civil organizations and patriotic compatriots will step up their work. What was most gratifying in Suzhou was meeting good friends Liu Yinmo and Wu Dakun. They are cadres of the Youth Association's Military Service Corps, working hard to provide voluntary service to wounded soldiers, with remarkable results. They repeatedly told me that their scope of work is vast, but the tools (such as books, newspapers, and radio) are insufficient. Everything in China needs to be worked hard from extreme difficulties. With their spirit of hard work and the lack of materials, I don't think it will hinder the development of their work.

### Stray Bullets Flying in the Fanwangdu Area, Fierce Fighting on Both Banks of Zhoujiaqiao

Enemy Attempts to Force Crossing the Suzhou Creek Under Artillery Cover Fail. Artillery Fire Resounds Throughout Shanghai From Morning to Noon. Enemy Continually Harasses From Yaojiadu to Xiaonanxiang.

Starting at dawn this morning, a fierce battle unfolded in the Zhoujiaqiao area west of Shanghai. Enemy troops, entrenched in small villages and near buildings and universities on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, launched attacks against us. Our troops on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek, along Zhongshan Road and the Zhoujiaqiao line, immediately responded with fierce bombardment. After 10:00 AM, the situation became even more tense. The sounds of cannons, machine guns, and rifles mingled together, echoing throughout Shanghai. Stray bullets flew in the area of Avenue Haig and Avenue du President Doumer near Fanwangdu. Residents in the vicinity all evacuated. The British defense forces south of the Fanwangdu iron bridge encountered enemy stray bullets, and two soldiers were injured. Another report stated that three people were killed on the spot. Whether this is true remains to be verified. Currently, Avenue du President Doumer west of Zhaofeng Garden has been closed to pedestrians, and the intersection with Yuyuan Road has been barricaded with barbed wire, cutting off traffic. The fighting was particularly fierce west of Fanwangdu to the Zhenbei Highway area. Both sides fired cannons loudly. By noon, it became more dense, like a string of beads. Under the cover of intense artillery fire, the enemy attempted to force a crossing of the Suzhou Creek. Our troops concentrated machine gun and rifle fire to deliver a fierce barrage, killing countless enemies. Seeing no opportunity to take advantage of, the enemy hid in defensive positions, indiscriminately attacking across the river and using cannons to bombard our positions in an attempt to destroy our fortifications. Our troops also opened fire in retaliation. At around 1:00 PM, the sound of cannons from both sides continued to roar. Also, along the central front line from Yaojiadu to Jiangqiao and Xiaonanxiang, the enemy troops appeared to be urgently reinforcing their positions from last night until before dawn this morning and actively building fortifications, hoping to invade westward. Fearing that our troops would take the opportunity to attack, more than a dozen small units harassed our lines, attempting to provide cover. At that time, our troops saw through their trick and initially ignored them. After their gunfire subsided, we immediately launched a counterattack. The enemy was caught off guard and hurriedly fired dense fire to stop our advance. Our troops, knowing that this was not our objective, returned to their original lines. However, the enemy came again shortly after and was repelled by our troops. This happened more than a dozen times. Dozens of enemy soldiers were killed before the enemy retreated. Our positions remained as solid as a rock, and we had nothing to fear. There was no fierce fighting all day yesterday on the Guangfu to Caowangmiao line.

### Fierce Artillery Battle at Zhoujiaqiao

Enemy Suffers Over One Hundred Casualties

A correspondent from the Central News Agency reported from the front lines at 1:00 PM on the 31st that at 2:00 AM this morning, the enemy in the Songjiata, Chenjiadu, and Jiangjiazha areas shelled our positions in the Zhoujiaqiao and Meijiazhai areas continuously, firing a total of six to seven hundred shells until about 4:30 AM. The enemy then released smoke screens to cover their troops crossing the river. Our troops swept them with concentrated machine gun fire as soon as they started to deploy their positions, causing the enemy to collapse and suffer over one hundred casualties. At around 11:00 AM, a fierce artillery battle broke out again between the enemy and our forces in the Zhoujiaqiao area and continued until noon.

### Enemy and Our Forces Clash Four or Five Times in the Zhenbei Road Area

A correspondent from the Central News Agency reported from the front lines at 1:00 PM on the 31st that at around 4:30 AM this morning, the enemy charged from Zhenbei Road, crossed Lizhai, and went straight to our positions at Huangjiazhai. Our soldiers cut them off bravely and fought back and forth four or five times. The battle temporarily ceased around 8:00 AM.

### Four Artillery Battles on the Huangpu River Last Night

Enemy Positions in Zhabei and East Shanghai Heavily Damaged. Enemy Attempts to Secretly Cross the Huangpu River to Pudong Using Rafts Fail.

At 7:30 PM last night, our troops stationed in Pudong received reports that the enemy would use rafts to secretly transport troops in an attempt to land. They immediately ordered strict vigilance along the entire Pudong line. First, the artillery batteries bombarded enemy positions in East Shanghai. Enemy warships on the Huangpu River hurriedly returned fire, and the battle was quite fierce. At about 8:00 PM, our observers discovered dark shadows on the Huangpu River near Taitong Wharf and the New Mitsui Warehouse east of Lujiazui. There were about a dozen rafts, each carrying fifteen soldiers, piled with sandbags in front, and armed with machine guns, towed by several small boats, attempting to rush toward the Pudong beaches in those areas. Before they approached, our garrison troops on each port used heavy machine guns to sweep the river fiercely. The enemy also returned fire, and the sounds of cannons and machine guns played a symphony, which was extremely fierce. At around 9:00 PM, the outposts reported that the enemy rafts had been repelled. The sound of artillery fire from both sides diminished. At 9:45 PM, our artillery once again displayed its power and continuously fired shells into enemy positions. The X artillery unit in the east joined the battle, while more than a dozen warships, from the Japanese Consulate on the west side of the Huangpu River to the Fish Market on the east side, jointly bombarded, extending the battle line for more than twenty miles. The fierce fighting stopped after 10:30 PM. Then, at around 11:00 PM, our enemy forces launched a third artillery battle. Chinese and foreign people were awakened by the rumbling of cannons at midnight. Our artillery focused on the vicinity of the enemy warships. It was heard that the flagship Izumo was hit by our artillery fire, which shows the chaos and embarrassment of the enemy warships at that time. The damage was indescribable. The fighting stopped at 2:00 AM this morning. Enemy positions in Yangshupu and Zhabei were also heavily damaged. At around 3:00 AM, enemy warships fiercely bombarded Pudong again in an attempt to retaliate. Our side, with its mission accomplished, ignored them. After the enemy fired for half an hour, seeing that we were unmoved, they gradually stopped at around 3:30 AM. In the four artillery battles last night, enemy warships fired a total of three to four hundred shells indiscriminately. Only a few civilian houses were knocked down. More than a dozen civilians, including Shen Wenkui, were injured by shrapnel. Zhang Fengzhi died because his intestines flowed out and he could not be saved in time. As for our military fortifications, they were not damaged at all.

### Enemy Shells Land in British Barracks Again

Three British Soldiers Wounded

At around 11:00 AM today (the 31st), enemy shells suddenly landed on the British barracks near Jessfield Park (i.e., Zhaofeng Park) west of Shanghai. Three British soldiers were injured. Two were slightly injured, and one was more seriously injured and may be in danger of death.

### Our Cannons Hit Enemy Destroyer

The Central News Agency reported that enemy warships anchored in the Huangpu River had engaged in fierce artillery battles with our Pudong artillery positions twice last night. The rumbling sound echoed throughout Shanghai. Our Pudong artillery positions, because of accurate targeting, often hit the enemy Destroyer No. 1 anchored at Buoy 37 in the Huangpu River. Many enemy soldiers on the ship were killed or wounded, and there was chaos on board. The extent of the damage was evident.

### Enemy Aircraft Carrier Arrives at Songkou Again Yesterday

At around 3:00 PM on the 29th, an enemy aircraft carrier sailed from Sasebo to Shanghai and docked at Sanjia Water outside the Wusong Estuary. It carried 45 of the latest type seaplanes and over 2,000 bombs.

There are over 300 enemy soldiers stationed at Tongjiaqiao Village, west of Beizhu Jiawan of Datong University. Two heavy cannons have been set up in the woods south of the front of the village in the south of Zhenru River. Also, a heavy cannon has been set up in the bamboo garden of the village.

The enemy has built a cement fortress southwest of Zhujiawan, behind the Central Mint. It has been completed and a heavy cannon has been erected there.

### Heroic Retreat from Sihang Warehouse: Our Brave Soldiers Move to New Positions

After Four Days of Bitter Fighting, Over Eighty Enemy Soldiers Killed; Our Casualties in Four Days of Fierce Battle Exceed Ten

—Sihang Warehouse Set Ablaze by the Enemy—

Our brave soldiers who steadfastly defended the Sihang Warehouse in Zhabei, left the safe zone at exactly 12:00 noon today to rest for a while in a certain location, and will then proceed to a new position. This reporter personally visited the aforementioned location this afternoon to meet with Deputy Commander Xie and Battalion Commander Yang. As a result, it was learned that in the past four days, our isolated army in Zhabei killed more than eighty enemy soldiers. Battalion Commander Yang sustained a minor injury while personally killing the enemy multiple times. Fortunately, the injury was to his foot, so his life is not in danger. In the past four days, over ten of our brave soldiers in Zhabei sacrificed their lives for the country. Originally determined to coexist with the defense line, they followed the orders of the supreme leader and withdrew at 3:00 AM this morning after packing their belongings. During the withdrawal, the Japanese side bombarded them with guns and cannons, resulting in several more of our soldiers being injured.

Holding Fast to Zhabei

The eight hundred brave soldiers of Deputy Commander Xie's and Battalion Commander Yang's forces in the Sihang Warehouse, following the orders of the supreme leader, retreated this morning around 2:00 AM under intense enemy fire with swift and disciplined action, reluctantly abandoning this last and most valuable defensive position. This reporter went to the Jiangyuan Lane area of Xinzha Road around 7:00 AM this morning to observe, and saw the Sihang Warehouse still standing tall on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, but

Empty

Increasing people's admiration for the brave soldiers. The western wall of the warehouse was riddled with bullet holes, and several places had been pierced through, showing the intensity of the enemy's artillery bombardment. After the enemy set it on fire, the inside of the warehouse was ablaze, which could be seen through the bullet holes. The enemy flag has been hoisted on top of the warehouse, and passersby are glancing at it askance. This reporter then learned from related sources that,

Sihang Warehouse

Initially cost over 200,000 yuan to build, but after so many years, it is now estimated to be worth around 500,000 yuan. The goods stored in the warehouse are mostly wheat, flour, soybeans, sesame, and other grains deposited by grain merchants. The quantity is quite large, worth about a million yuan. However, it is said that the Sihang authorities and grain merchants have each taken out their own insurance. The total loss is estimated to be over 1.5 million yuan. According to another report, after our heroic isolated army of over eight hundred in Zhabei withdrew at 2:00 AM this morning on the orders of the supreme authority, the enemy

Remained Unaware

Therefore, until around 5:00 AM this morning, as dawn was breaking, the enemy army still fired at the Sihang Warehouse with rifles. After seeing no movement, they sent several enemy soldiers crawling along the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, feeling their way forward. Only when they reached the entrance of the Sihang Warehouse did they discover that our army had withdrawn. Then a large contingent entered. Their

Fear of Our Bravery

Of the isolated army was such that, the Sihang godown had been hit by bullets and set on fire, and the items stored inside had been burned and rendered unusable. Therefore, even though the enemy has now entered the area, they have gained no benefit. Furthermore, when this reporter went to Xinzha Road again this morning at 8:00 AM to inspect, I saw more than ten enemy soldiers carrying the bodies of enemy soldiers who had

Died from Gunfire

On the rubble field between the Sihang godown and the Jiangsu Bank godown. In less than half an hour, there were twenty or thirty bodies, which were loaded onto two trucks and transported to Hongkou. From this, it can be seen that the enemy army suffered heavy casualties in the past four days of resistance from our heroic isolated army, and it increases our boundless respect for the eight hundred brave soldiers.

### Enemy Plans to Destroy Obstacles in the Huangpu River

Several days ago, a Japanese transport ship arrived in Shanghai and docked at the NYK Line wharf, bringing six diving experts and unloading special explosive torpedoes to destroy the obstacles in the Huangpu River. Four fast boats, each with a load capacity of twenty tons, were also unloaded and are now docked at the fish market.

Today (31st) at 7:30 AM, two more enemy transport ships of unknown number and transport ships converted from merchant ships, the Shanghai Maru, successively sailed into Shanghai and docked at the China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf and the Wayson Wharf, carrying food, bombs, and other large quantities of military supplies. They were immediately unloaded and taken ashore.

### Enemy Aircraft Activity Hindered

Starting this morning, the city has been covered with drizzling autumn rain and dark clouds, which has greatly hindered the activity of enemy aircraft, forcing them to stop. Therefore, until 10:00 AM, no enemy aircraft were spotted over the city. However, around 11:00 AM, an enemy seaplane was active in the Pudong area, but because the air pressure was too low, it could not carry out its tricks and fled in less than five minutes.

### Enemy Notifies Consulates of Planned Bombing of Nanshi

It is reported that the enemy notified the consulates of Britain, the United States, France, and other countries in Shanghai this morning, asking them to inform churches, schools, and organizations in the Nanshi area to order foreign residents living there to move out immediately, saying that they would bomb Nanshi this afternoon. It is heard that the French side has sent the navy to Nanshi to protect the main water pipes of the waterworks.

### An American Youth Serving Our War of Resistance

Renounces His Position by Taking Chinese Citizenship; Determined to Stand With the 50th Boy Scout Regiment

Our country's war of resistance to uphold the dignity of human justice and world peace has received the great sympathy and assistance of peace-loving people around the world. In the transportation team of the 50th Boy Scout Regiment of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, there is also a compatriot from a friendly nation who is willing to sacrifice everything for our war of resistance. He is an American, in his thirties, named H.F. Lowler. He used to work at the Ford Motor Factory in Pudong. During the January 28th Incident, he participated in our rescue work. After this August 13th War of Resistance, he volunteered to join the transportation team of the 50th Boy Scout Regiment as a car driver and repair technician, and took on the work of rescuing wounded soldiers on the front lines.

He is a man of determination and courage, with a very amiable attitude. For more than two months, he has been working in the line of fire, braving enemy planes and artillery. He has not flinched, but has instead strengthened his determination to serve our war of resistance. He recently worked on the front lines for three days and three nights without rest. When others advised him to come back, he refused to leave the front lines. Now, he is determined to devote all his energy to working with the Boy Scout Regiment and sacrificing himself to the end. He has already resigned from his position at the factory, taken Chinese citizenship, and changed his Chinese name to "Lu Huifeng." His spirit truly makes us admire and thank him.

### Germany Reaffirms Its Attitude Toward the Nine-Power Treaty Conference

Willing to Participate in Cooperation at Any Time When Conditions Are Met; Unexpectedly, the Foreign Minister Decides Not to Attend in Person

⊙Munich German Foreign Minister Neurath delivered a speech at the annual meeting of the German Academy of Law today, clarifying Germany's attitude towards the Beijing Conference. Neurath first analyzed the views of group politics, then stated that the Nine-Power Conference is a practical opportunity to consider ways to resolve international disputes. Germany did not accept the invitation because the conference was convened to implement the terms of the 1922 Washington Treaty. Since Germany is not a signatory, it cannot be expected to participate necessarily. However, the reply has clearly stated that when the time is ripe and the main conditions are met, Germany is willing to participate in the cooperation to mediate the Sino-Japanese conflict at any time. Regarding the prospects of the Beijing Conference, Neurath declared that the League of Nations had very little of the composition of group politics when convening this conference, and its progress may not be very smooth. He (Neurath) believes that no matter what the attitude of each country towards the Sino-Japanese conflict, it is difficult to achieve the purpose of mediation if they are in the position of moral arbiters when mediating the war. (30th Haitong Telegraph)

[Rome] It is heard that the Italian representative to the Beijing Nine-Power Treaty Conference will be Count Marescotti. Foreign Minister Ciano has decided not to attend in person. It has been verified that Marescotti is an expert on Far Eastern affairs at the Italian Foreign Ministry and participated in the Lytton Commission as the Italian representative in 1932.

### New Belgian Cabinet Stillborn

⊙Brussels Since the resignation of former Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland, no new government has been formed.

Therefore, the whole country hopes that a new government can be produced before the opening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. (30th Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency)

### Italian Ambassador to France Suddenly Recalled

Paris Greatly Surprised

[London] Due to the sudden recall of Italian Ambassador to France Cerruti, various European countries are speculating. Paris is particularly surprised. According to the official explanation from Paris, Italy took this action because Rome lacks a French ambassador. It is because Ambassador Chamberlin, stationed in Italy, has not had a successor since his retirement last year. And if France must send an ambassador to Italy, it must recognize Italy as the Emperor of Abyssinia. Another saying claims that the speech delivered by the French Radical Socialist Party at the conference convened in Le Lelly last Friday has greatly angered Mussolini. However, this saying is now untenable. When the former Italian ambassador was recalled, Le Lelly's speech had not yet been conveyed to Rome. It has been verified that during the session of the Radical Socialist Party conference, former Prime Minister Herriot implied ominous progress in Africa and asked, "The flag hanging in Balmadi, who knows it is the Spanish flag?" At the same time, Foreign Minister Delbos also compared the matters of Manchuria and Abyssinia, saying that the destruction of the treaty has made imperialism bolder and more anxious for the threatened countries. On the unofficial side in Rome, it is believed that the ambassador's recall is due to the increasingly deteriorating friendship between the two countries last year, and it is felt that the current poor feelings between France and Italy have reached the extreme point after French Foreign Minister Laval's visit to Italy in 1935. However, on the official level, it is only said that Cerruti's return to the country is because Cerruti wants to spend his Christmas holiday in Rome. Furthermore, it is rumored that there will be a large number of personnel changes in the Italian diplomatic staff, and Cerruti intends to be given other appointments, while the French embassy will be headed by a chargé d'affaires.

### German Red Cross Assists Our Medical Care

Relieving Wounded Soldiers and Refugees

[Berlin] After the Chinese government issued an appeal to European countries to relieve wounded soldiers and refugees, the German Red Cross is now collecting a large number of medical equipment, smallpox vaccines, bandages, and other relief supplies, preparing to transport them to China in the shortest possible time and donate them to the Chinese Red Cross to help with the relief needs.

### Soviet-Manchurian Border Conflict Incident: The Soviet Union Protests to Japan and the Puppet State

[Moscow] Regarding the recent conflict on the Soviet-Manchurian border, the Soviet Foreign Affairs Committee has also instructed its ambassador to Japan and consul-general in Harbin to protest to both Japan and the puppet state. According to reports received by the Soviet side in Boli, on October 28, a team of Manchurian troops crossed the border in the Boslai area and opened fire on Soviet border guards. The guards immediately returned fire, forcing the puppet troops to retreat. However, the Japanese side has denied all of the above, claiming that Soviet troops crossed the border and fired on Manchurian troops stationed in the Tumen River. The Manchurian army immediately repelled the invaders. (31st Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency)

### Miscellaneous Comments

— Phases

Mr. Herriot, Speaker of the French House of Representatives, said during a speech at the Radical Socialist Party Congress. Roughly stated. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Once said that the entire Europe should be fascism in the future, as far as I know, at least one country must not be like this. These words are very strong and interesting. I can extend his saying now. If Fascism is so unscrupulous. Exhausting military force. I am afraid that the world will be completely democratized. I am afraid that there will be fascist existence in any corner of the world. Because the promotion of a doctrine or a theory. Written speeches and other propaganda. It is indispensable. And the creation of the times. Compared with writing speeches and other propaganda, it has a thousand times more power. Because now fascist kinds of behavior. All are creating opportunities for democratic governance. Now the democratic people only need to unite their forces. Strive forward. There is no need to talk about it again.

Youth in Wartime, 27th Issue

### The Situation of Students Under the Iron Heel

— Guo Woli

Since 'July 8th', our army has been fighting bloody battles, and everyone has been burying themselves in the work of national salvation under 'perseverance', vowing to never coexist with the vicious international bandits. This atmosphere excites us to tears! Otherwise, our existence would be meaningless, and how could we face the millions of martyrs who sacrificed themselves? The enemy bandits and traitors in the Pingjin area have exhausted all means of cruelty against our people! Especially young students feel special suffering!

The youth's blood is passionate, and their actions are radical. They are only concerned with the nation and the country. Except for a very small number of villains who agree to 'recognize the enemy as their father' and compete for merit, they only know how to work hard, without compromise, only know how to resist, without yielding. Therefore, the enemy hates our youth to the bone, and either brutally kills them or secretly eliminates them with 'bloodless killing' methods.

After the occupation of the city of several thousand years of culture, the traitors rampaged. Their only behavior to please the enemy bandits is to assist in cultural aggression and eliminate our national consciousness. The actual situation broadcasted successively by telegrams is very numerous, and here I only briefly provide a summary.

Pan Yugui, the infuriating head of the pseudo-Ping Police Bureau, and Niu Chuanshan, an important member of the Tianjin Municipal Pseudo-Maintenance Association, claim to be outstanding figures in the Pingjin traitor front. They brazenly ordered all books that were supposedly 'harmful to friendly relations' to be burned within a time limit. They also offered rewards for arresting students and activists in the cultural world. They raped the will of the youth, slandered the personality of the youth, and established various absurd youth advancement traitor work groups to curry favor with the enemy bandits.

Recently, Tianjin has intensified its efforts, pandering to the enemy's preferences, and in order to eradicate reactionary thoughts, openly forced all schools to implement 'ideological reporting'. Regardless of teachers or students, if their words, actions, or thoughts have anti-Japanese tendencies, the school's traitor authorities will thoroughly report them, arrest them, and send them to pseudo-officials for punishment. As a result, they kill indiscriminately. Furthermore, they are 'meticulous' in replacing all slogans containing national meaning and patriotic sentiment in all libraries, reading rooms, and civic education institutions, as well as public gathering places, with alarming words such as: 'Realize the Autonomy of North China', 'Promote Sino-Japanese Friendship', and 'Create a Happy Land of Autonomy in North China'.

Hearing these absurd acts of 'serving as accomplices to the tiger' and 'assisting the tyrant', we think of the youth restrained under the iron heel. Even if they don't die, their souls have been lost everywhere!

It is a small matter to have no clothes to wear or food to eat. Being deprived of freedom is equivalent to being a corpse. 'Natural human rights', 'give me liberty, or give me death', what are they for? Even the freedom of thought has been completely deprived. Their madness is an unprecedented example in world history. If we do not quickly rise up and 'exterminate these enemies before breakfast', assist history in following the wheels of the times, and advance gloriously, the Chinese nation will be finished from now on!

We are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor, brothers of the same blood. Their situation is so critical! If we cannot rescue them from danger in the shortest possible time, and delay it any longer, will we still be able to hear their last gasps?

Without sufficient preparation, how can we shoulder the long-term and arduous mission? Therefore, the youth in the rear should be especially vigilant. 'Those who walk on extremely dangerous paths cannot be safe with ordinary methods.' We can no longer be indecisive and perfunctory, wasting time and indulging in useless dead books. General Li Zongren advocates that 'university students, except for those in science and engineering who should focus on manufacturing military supplies, the remaining students in liberal arts must all go deep into the countryside to organize the masses...' This is indeed what the war of resistance urgently needs at present. Therefore, we must quickly rouse ourselves, temper ourselves, and enrich ourselves with practical tools. Those who have money should contribute money, and those who have no money should contribute strength, even reducing clothing and food, and work together wholeheartedly. Form a tight front, a strong united force, and lead the restoration of the mass organizations of the Northern Expedition era. Believe in the government, concentrate under the command of the supreme commander, fight to the death with the enemy, sweep away the dark clouds and create a bright path, recover all lost territories, save them from fire and water, and ensure the eternal independence and freedom of the Chinese nation.

### Soviet Youth (II)

— Yu Yuansheng

In the past, the Soviet Union was a country with backward production. Since the revolution, the authorities have intensified their efforts to train young people. The reason why the Soviet Union has become so strong today is that training young people is the greatest achievement.

Regarding the situation of youth training in the Soviet Union, this is of course what the general readers urgently need to know. Here, I will briefly describe it:

There are two youth training groups in the Soviet Union, one is the October Children's Group, and the other is the Young Pioneers. For the former, all children aged seven to ten are members, and the organization is based on the 'division'; the latter's members are boys and girls aged ten to sixteen, and the organization is based on the 'team'.

Youth training in the Soviet Union focuses on spontaneity and initiative, starting with the actual life habits of young people. They often use discussions, debates, lectures, dramas, games, travel, etc. to instill correct concepts in young people, to promote the upward spirit of young people, and to improve the pure thinking of young people.

The tasks of the October Children's Group and the Young Pioneers are very great. In peacetime, they teach family members to read and write, help farmers eliminate pests, and assist military police in maintaining order at meetings. In wartime, they also mobilize a large number of young people to donate everywhere, or take on rescue and transportation work at the front. They have all made great contributions to the country.

When we look at the enthusiasm of Soviet youth for being loyal to the country, what kind of feeling should be aroused in our minds?
