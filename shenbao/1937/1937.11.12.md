### Our Troops Vow to Recover Songhu, Shanghai Compatriots Become More Resolute and Strive Forward

Never Forget the Tragic Deaths and Injuries of Soldiers and Civilians Over the Past Three Months. We Should Encourage Each Other to Continue to Promote the Spirit of the Martyrs. A Letter from the Military Affairs Commission to the People of Shanghai

The Political Training Department of the Military Affairs Commission yesterday issued a letter to the people of Shanghai, saying: "Dear compatriots of Shanghai, our army is temporarily withdrawing from the vicinity of Shanghai due to strategic considerations. On the one hand, we are making every effort to consolidate the second line of defense and will actively advance within the shortest possible time to recover our Songhu. This retreat of our army is a planned strategic retreat and is by no means a defeat in the war. Moreover, the real war of resistance against Japan has actually only just begun at this time. This is something that our compatriots have already clearly recognized and can be even more diligent about. Our army is parting ways with the people of Shanghai. Recalling the three months of resistance, our Shanghai compatriots, regardless of danger and day and night, worked hard to assist the front line. All the needs of the front line were met as soon as they were requested. The sacrifices near the war zone were extremely tragic, and the spirit of cooperation between the military and the people to resist the enemy became stronger and stronger. This kind of righteousness and enthusiasm is something that all our officers and soldiers will engrave in their hearts and never forget for the rest of their lives.

Although our army is temporarily withdrawing, we must not forget our compatriots for a moment. When our army retreats from Shanghai, the enemy will inevitably use all kinds of oppression and temptation against you compatriots. This is very sad and very worrying for us. But we believe that the patriotic Shanghai compatriots, although they are in a very difficult situation now, their will must be firm. We sincerely hope that the people of Shanghai will always uphold the spirit of sacrifice and resistance, help each other, encourage each other, and treat everyone as if they were soldiers on the battlefield, vowing to resist the enemy to the end. The people of Shanghai will certainly not forget the tragic deaths and injuries of the military and the people during the past three months, and will continue to promote the spirit of the martyrs. Shanghai is the center where our national spirit is concentrated and promoted. The people of Shanghai must be determined to build a Great Wall of national spirit.

Compatriots, our army is temporarily parting ways with you. Our hearts are filled with memories of the suffering and sacrifices of all of you. We cannot express our gratitude for the patriotic spirit that you have already shown. We will always remember the encouragement of our compatriots, and we must continue to work hard and fight to the end. Although we have left Shanghai, our army can still see Shanghai from the positions in Jiading and Nanxiang. The souls of our martyred soldiers are still entrusted to Shanghai. Our heart, which is full of enthusiasm for the nationwide war of resistance, is always inseparable from the people of Shanghai. Our spirits and those of our fellow countrymen are forever connected to each other. We will unite as one and fight with one heart and one mind. The war of resistance will surely be victorious, and the rejuvenation will surely be successful. Our army will surely recover Songhu in the shortest possible time to repay our compatriots. We will never let down the ardent expectations of the people of Shanghai." Political Training Department of the Military Affairs Commission.

### The Exhausted and Starving Garrison of Nanshi Retreated

The Military Authorities Ordered the Retreat Yesterday, But a Few Soldiers and Police Officers Vowed to Resist to the Death

The Central News Agency reported that after our army moved back from western Shanghai and Pudong, Nanshi had fallen into the encirclement of the enemy army. The residents of the area were about to be humiliated by the enemy army. In order to defend the people, our military authorities strictly ordered the Zhang Brigade of the 55th Division to join forces with the Police Headquarters and the Special Operations Detachment of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Committee to defend the area to the death so that the residents could retreat safely. Under the fierce attack of the enemy's naval, land, and air forces, although the Rizhao Port position was broken through, our loyal and brave soldiers still fought bravely. After a hard struggle until late last night, they were finally outnumbered and their water and food supplies were exhausted. They had fought to the last moment, and the military authorities ordered a retreat. However, there were still a few troops who vowed to resist the enemy to the death. The details of the battle situation are recorded as follows:

Enemy Launches Fierce Attack

The brutal enemy launched a general attack on our Nanshi starting at noon the day before yesterday. Our lone army brigade and the Police Headquarters were ordered to take charge of the defenses along Rizhao Port and the Huangpu River, and immediately engaged in a desperate battle with the enemy to defend this last position in Songhu. Although the enemy used its powerful naval, land, and air weapons and launched a fierce attack on the 16th Pier and Rizhao Port along two lines throughout the day, our army fought loyally and bravely, and was able to hold the position and inflict heavy damage on the enemy. The enemy was unwilling to give up, so they continued to attack yesterday morning. At about 6:00, more than 30 enemy planes were seen bombing over Nanshi, dropping no less than 100 bombs, causing almost all the houses in the city to be destroyed and many fires to break out, burning fiercely. After 7:30, the enemy concentrated artillery fire from Longhua, Xujiahui, Pudong, and warships in the river to bombard us fiercely, firing more than a thousand shells.

Our Troops Fight Hard

Under this fierce bombardment, the fortifications of our front-line positions were inevitably damaged, but they were repaired at any time, and we calmly responded to the enemy, preparing and guarding without懈怠. About 100 enemies who secretly crossed Rizhao Port were killed by us. Near noon, the enemy used smoke screens to launch a large-scale attack, causing our positions between Pingyin Bridge and Kangqu Bridge to be broken through by the enemy. The troops stationed there were threatened by artillery fire, and it was difficult to replenish them. After several hours of hard fighting, more than half of them had been killed or wounded, so they had to retreat to the second line of defense. The troops along the Xiexu Road line were cut off from contact and had no way to retreat, so they were chased back to the concession. However, there were still a few people who were determined to kill the enemy and were still ambushed in the alleys, attacking the enemy. Therefore, at about 4:00 in the afternoon, there were still sparse rifle shots in the area.

Exhausted and Starving, Troops Retreat

After the enemy troops crossed Rizhao Port, they led with five tanks and advanced south along Quzhenren Road and Kangqu Road, passing through Zhizaoju Road and Fangxie Road towards the city. Our army defended the streets and alleys, fighting bravely to meet the enemy. Brigade Commander Zhang also devoted himself to the country, personally went to the front line to command, and strictly forbade his subordinates to retreat, vowing to coexist and die with the position. He also said to his subordinates, "I am determined to defend Nanshi to the death. Even if there is only one gun and one bullet left, I will fight to the end. Even if it has reached the point where nothing can be done, I vow to die with the position." After he finished speaking, he joined the soldiers in battle. His subordinates were moved to tears when they saw that he acted as he spoke, so they were unusually motivated. In the evening, there was still fierce fighting near Tangjiawan. On the 16th Pier, although the enemy secretly crossed with many small boats, they were not successful because of our strict defense. Later, the water supply in the area was cut off and the food supply was exhausted, so we had to obey the order of the military authorities to retreat. However, there were still a few police officers and soldiers who vowed to resist to the death. Their loyalty and determination were moving.

Brief Biography of Brigade Commander Zhang Bin

Zhang Bin, the brigade commander who was ordered to defend the position, whose courtesy name is Wenxuan, is a graduate of the Japanese Military Academy. He has held various military positions and is known for his calmness, bravery, and loyalty. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War on August 13, he has been commanding his troops and artillery teams in Pudong. The enemy has repeatedly tried to land in Pudong, but has been repelled. For more than two months, the position has not changed. His achievements in the war of resistance have long been praised by the people of the country. This time, he was ordered to personally lead his troops to defend Nanshi. His heroic spirit and determination to resist the war are truly admirable. However, due to the fierce artillery fire of the enemy, he was broken through. Brigade Commander Zhang's ambition has not been realized, and his whereabouts are still unknown, which is very regrettable.

Real Record of the Hard Fight Yesterday

The Central News Agency reported that the lone army defending Nanshi fought a bloody battle with the brutal enemy for the third day yesterday. From early in the morning, the sound of artillery was incessant, shaking the houses. At 10:00, it became even more fierce. At the same time, more than 20 enemy bombers took turns flying and dropping bombs over Nanshi. Where the explosions sounded, black smoke soared, allowing the Chinese and foreigners living in the concession to have an unprecedentedly clear understanding of the enemy's brutal and poisonous behavior. At noon, the reporter called Cai Jinjun, the director of the war command, to inquire about the battle situation. Cai's voice was hoarse, which shows that he and all the loyal soldiers and officers were working hard. According to him, the enemy army yesterday used two small warships with dozens of soldiers on board to approach our blockade line. A small number of enemy troops climbed onto the Zhonghe Wheel, which had been deliberately sunk, and exchanged machine gun fire with our army. The fierce fighting continued from the night before until yesterday morning. In Pudong, the enemy army has now landed. In addition to spying on the situation in our Nanshi, transporting coal, looting, and burning, they have also set up 40 artillery pieces to bombard our large piers. It is estimated that more than 960 shells were fired yesterday morning. Fortunately, the areas along the river are all tall buildings, as strong as fortresses. Although the enemy's artillery fire is fierce, it can only pierce a few holes in the walls. As for Rizhao Port, the enemy is also attacking fiercely. Our army is calmly responding to the enemy, and the enemy has not succeeded so far. The reporter then asked about the casualties of our army in the three days of hard fighting. According to him, although the enemy's planes and artillery are fierce and have caused many civilian houses to be bombed and collapsed, our fortifications have not been destroyed. Our loyal soldiers and police officers have been fighting hard day and night for three days, and only three people have been injured. Cai finally told the reporter in a firm tone that although all our loyal soldiers and police officers are in a difficult situation surrounded by the enemy on all sides, their morale is high and unmatched. The enemy's fierce artillery fire can threaten our fortifications, but it can never threaten our resolute spirit. We vow to carry out a scorched-earth resistance war with the enemy on our last position in Shanghai, firing the last bullet and shedding the last drop of blood.

### Our Troops Firmly Defend Songjiang City

Fierce Fighting Near Shihudang

Military News: Our army along the Jinghu Road is currently holding the line from Nanxiang to Huangdu. The enemy army does not dare to attack, so there is no fierce fighting on this line. In the Jiangqiao area, our army has moved slightly to the west. After the right-wing defense line retreated from western Shanghai, it moved to the line from Sijing to Songjiang. Before dawn yesterday morning, a part of the enemy army approached Sijing in several ways from the Qibao Town area, and fierce fighting took place there. Our army has established close contact from Sijing to Songjiang. As of yesterday noon, Songjiang was still firmly defended by our army. As for the enemy troops in areas such as Tuanlaimiao, Jinshan, and Quan Gong Pavilion, although they attacked north and west in an attempt to occupy the two key points of Pinghu and Zhapu to relieve the siege of Shihudang, our army had already mobilized heavy troops to launch a strict attack, and the enemy's conspiracy was doomed to fail. According to official sources, Pinghu and Zhapu were still being secured by our army as of yesterday morning.

Central News Agency, Military News: Our army's new defense line between the Suzhou River and the Huangpu River has been deployed according to plan, holding the Huangdu Town on the north bank of the Suzhou River and Songjiang on the north bank of the Huangpu River. The contact point between them is Sijing Town, which protrudes eastward. The entire line is 32 kilometers long. The enemy army's westward attack has already resulted in fierce fighting near Sijing. Our position is stable, and the city of Songjiang is also being firmly defended by our army.

Central News Agency Military Correspondent's report at 13:30 on the 11th: Fierce fighting broke out again near Shihudang at about 19:30 last night. The artillery fire was extremely fierce and did not stop all night. By about 6:00 this morning, the enemy's deaths and injuries had reached more than 500 people. We also had considerable casualties, but the situation has stabilized.

### Mayor Yu's Letter to the Citizens

Do Not Be Discouraged by the Slight Shift in the Battlefield; Rather, Be More Loyal Due to the Changed Environment

Mayor Yu issued a letter to the citizens yesterday, saying: "The war of resistance in Shanghai has lasted for three months. Our citizens have been running around, displaced and analyzed, enduring hardships without complaint, and not hesitating to face dangers. They have followed the Supreme Leader's instruction to fight a long-term war of resistance and have pledged the entire society's commitment to shared destiny. As a result, the military has been able to fulfill its duties, and the soldiers have been more courageous and inspired. In these 90 days, we have inflicted huge losses on the enemy and won the sincere praise of friendly countries. Hongjun has been ordered to respond to this crisis and humbly contribute his meager efforts to the most admirable army, slightly reducing his shortcomings in his inescapable responsibilities, all thanks to the greatest sacrifices and efforts of all our citizens and leaders from all walks of life. Speaking of this, I feel both grateful and ashamed. Now, in order to strengthen the strategy of resistance, the front line has left the city, and the progress of municipal administration will be hindered. Hongjun recalls the past and silently considers the future, and there are things that he cannot help but say. He respectfully expresses his sincerity and tells everyone:

Our past achievements in this war of resistance, which were arduous and outstanding, not only changed the views of foreigners, but also enhanced our self-confidence, which is even more important. Because a nation that loves peace is forced to fight against a militaristic and powerful enemy, what it relies on is this firm and unyielding will, and this calm, decisive, and agile behavior. As long as every inch of land that is advanced or retreated has a price to be paid, then the current small victories and small defeats have nothing to do with the measurement of the final gains and losses. This is the spirit and meaning of a long-term war of resistance, which must be thoroughly understood, without any need for hesitation or consideration. The duration of the war of resistance in Shanghai has been sufficient to prove the accuracy of our people's understanding and the accuracy of our estimates. Our experience in these three months should be further explored. Everything that we have done, which can be used as a method, which can be used as a warning, which organization is not yet fully understood, and which measures are not yet fully confidential, should be used as a warning and encouragement in one corner, and as a reference for the overall situation. Then, the spirit of resistance of the citizens of Shanghai will be sufficient to become the spirit of resistance of the entire nation, and the experience of resistance of the citizens of Shanghai will be sufficient to become the experience of resistance of the entire nation. Our millions of people have this belief, which can enable the hundreds of millions of people across the country to adhere to this belief without wavering. Therefore, I earnestly hope that the people of Shanghai will not be discouraged by the slight shift in the battlefield; rather, they should be more loyal due to the changed environment. Hongjun is in an unworthy position and deeply regrets his shortcomings. Now, I would like to tell the people, who are tired and struggling, about the spirit and belief of a long-term war of resistance. I hope that you will think deeply and encourage each other."

### Detailed Account of the Fall of Pudong

The Enemy Landed in Five Routes and Entered the Pudong Avenue; Traitors and Plainclothes Teams Were Actively Involved

The Central News Agency reported that after our army withdrew from Pudong, the enemy began to land there yesterday. First, at about 2:00 AM, 20 people in a small motorboat landed at the New Mitsui Wharf to reconnoiter. Seeing no movement, another group landed at about 5:00 AM. By about 7:00 AM, they had dispersed to areas such as Lujiazui and Lan Nibo. In addition to inspecting passers-by, they also set fires. The warehouses along the river were all torched, and the fires had not been extinguished by nightfall. It was also reported that there were enemy traces in the Fangxi area of Tangqiao.

Since the Launch of the Songhu War of Resistance

Due to its geographical location, Pudong fell into the war zone. We deployed considerable troops along the Pudong border, supplemented by powerful artillery teams, to fight against the enemy for three months, inflicting heavy losses on them repeatedly, smashing the enemy's dream of landing into pieces. The enemy had no other choice but to change its strategy. Until recently, it secretly landed at Jinshan Mouth and advanced to Songjiang. The Pudong garrison was ordered to go to southern Pudong to kill the enemy. Therefore, on the evening of the 6th, the original Pudong border positions were abandoned on the way to the battle. The remaining defense was strictly guarded by a five-page squad, together with local police and security team members. Therefore, a disturbance arose on the following day. Only because the enemy was focusing all its attention on Huxi and southern Pudong, it was completely unaware of the change in the situation in Pudong. Therefore, for the next eight, nine, and three days, it continued to send planes to bomb. The enemy warships in the Huangpu River also continued to fire their guns to prevent our army from attacking. Their fear and timidity were the same as in the past. After the transfer of the war situation in Huxi, our military and police authorities expressed their determination to defend Nanshi. The enemy army, in view of our army's great past achievements, did not dare to attack lightly. Therefore, it ordered the mobilization of the three services of the navy, army, and air force to attack with all their strength. At about 5:00 PM the night before last, it also dispatched the "Niiken" gunboat to sail into the fleet of various countries, directly approaching the Huangpu River blockade line. Then came several small motorboats, attempting to attack the Ningshao Wharf. Our garrison fired at them with machine guns, making it impossible for them to advance. Since there was no movement at the Pudong Dongchang Wharf, at about 7:00 PM, an enemy boat sailed to the wharf to reconnoiter. Several enemy soldiers crawled ashore.

Our Police Team Acted Calmly

The enemy soldiers snaked to Laiyi Wharf Street, only to find that it was an empty position. They returned to the ship to report. Yesterday morning, just as dawn broke, a large part of the naval infantry in yellow uniforms was transferred and landed on the docks of Qichang Warehouse, Taitong Warehouse, Fenshan, Chunhong, and Dongchang in five routes. At this time, our police team, after receiving the report, had safely withdrawn in advance. Therefore, the enemy soldiers did not encounter any resistance after landing and went deep into Pudong Avenue, setting up machine guns at the key intersections and arranging posts at the street corners. Plainclothes teams and traitors were all active. At that time, a security team member who had stayed behind was arrested by an enemy soldier and forced to lead the way. The team member had a pistol hidden on his body, but the enemy soldier did not notice it. When he was about to arrest the second person, the team member had a sudden idea, took out his gun, and shot the enemy.

Pulled the Enemy Down

and fled away. Then, the enemy soldiers in the distance became furious and shot at anyone wearing a coppersmith's uniform or a student's uniform. Even those who wore yellow pants or running shoes were not spared. There were many corpses lying in front of the Xiaoyangjing Temple. The residents who had not had time to escape were in extreme chaos. The enemy soldiers blocked them from all sides, preventing them from advancing or retreating. About 200 or 300 people were arrested as plainclothes teams and tied to the utility poles in various streets. The largest number were detained in Sanwanchang. At that time, because a large number of enemy troops were heading south, they were not harmed. It was not until noon that the enemy plainclothes team members who were familiar with Shanghai took charge and brought all the arrested people to the Shifanli in Dongchang Road for detention. A small number were released, and the rest were

Severely Tortured

and forced to reveal the residences of the local leaders of various organizations and groups so that they could be set on fire. Several men on Lujia Ferry Road tried to escape after seeing the enemy soldiers. They were arrested, stripped of their clothes, and their bellies cut open. After their intestines flowed out, they were hung on utility poles to be shown to the public. The second type of destruction carried out by the enemy troops after landing was arson. Yesterday, from morning to night, thick smoke covered the sky everywhere. There were more than 20 places that were set on fire. As far as the reporter knows, Yangjing Town was the most hated by the enemy. The enemy planes bombed it dozens of times, but they still felt it was not enough. The remaining houses were also burned down yesterday. The city houses of Gongchang Warehouse, the Yang Family houses in the east and west, the Lu Family houses, and the houses south of Sanwanchang, all the way to the Garden Stone Bridge and the Pudong Grand Theater, thousands of civilian houses were turned into scorched earth. Hundreds of houses were also burned down at the southern end of Dongchang Road. The old residence of Chen Tingzhang, a wealthy man in the East Yang Family house, was

Magnificent

and was occupied by the enemy as a command post, with two large and small Japanese flags hanging from the roof, so it was not burned. On all the streets, the enemy soldiers have dense outposts. Even the old and weak residents who have stayed behind have lost their freedom. In addition, a large part of the enemy troops gathered on Pudong Avenue yesterday afternoon and headed south, led by traitors, heading separately towards the boundaries of Chuansha and Nanhui, and entering Fengxian County to join up with the enemy troops in southern Pudong and advance towards Minhang. In addition, the Taikoo Huatong Warehouse, a British merchant in Laiyi Ferry, was occupied by the enemy soldiers yesterday afternoon. It is said that the Taikoo authorities will negotiate with the enemy on the grounds of destroying the rights and interests of third countries.

The Pudong Garrison

was originally guarded by the ××th commander, the 2nd and 5th Regiments of the Security Corps, and the police of the Pudong Police Sub-bureau, all under the command of the ××th Division. When our troops in Huxi withdrew westward the day before, a part of the troops and the police of the Security Corps stationed in Pudong were ordered to go to Nanshi to garrison. At that time, the branch director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, Zhang Yongzhu, and more than 50 policemen and members of the Security Corps were stationed in Lan Nibo. They were all willing to defend Pudong to the death and were unwilling to leave. Therefore, they still held on to the Lan Nibo Police Station. However, they also deployed police force in Lujiazui and other places to guard and clearly

Engage in a Desperate Battle with the Enemy

The enemy went to land several times on the 8th and 9th, but were attacked and routed by the dozens of brave men. Until 11:00 PM on the (day before yesterday), the 10th, hundreds of enemy soldiers landed again at the Dongchang Wharf and were again killed by dozens of people. Only because a large number of enemy troops landed at the Qichang Warehouse, Branch Director Zhang ordered the troops to withdraw from Pudong and retreat to Nanshi. As a result, Pudong completely fell into the hands of the enemy. It is now reported that Zhang has also retired to Pudong and joined the defensive line in Nanshi. Zhang, with his loyal and courageous spirit, led dozens of soldiers and was able to resist the enemy's large army for three days and nights, truly a model for our soldiers. It is said that yesterday the enemy used many small motorboats to travel back and forth between the Huishan Wharf and the New Mitsui Wharf all day long, transporting the enemy troops in eastern Shanghai to Pudong in batches. In addition, there were

Enemy Destroyers

The warship Rquga, the supply ship Shiretoko, and the gunboat Ataka, a total of three ships, traveled back and forth between the enemy's Hua Wharf in the Dong District and the Zhao Shang Hua Warehouse, the New Okayama Wharf, and the New Mitsui Wharf, unloading war horses, large and small artillery, bullets, tanks, armored vehicles, and other artillery military supplies. After 4:00 PM, one of the gunboats sailed to the Mitsubishi Wharf to dock, one of the supply ships sailed to the Zhao Shang Bureau North Warehouse to dock, and one of the destroyers remained moored at the Zhao Shang Hua Warehouse in Pudong. Yesterday, the enemy continued to use the supply ship Nara and Ma to sail to the Zhao Shang Bureau Central Warehouse, carrying a large number of heavy weapons such as enemy armored vehicles and tanks.

### The Daily Mail Reporter Stephen Was Killed

Stephen, a special correspondent for the London Daily Mail, was sent to Shanghai to work after the outbreak of the Shanghai War. At about 2:00 PM yesterday, while observing the battle situation in Nanshi on the water tower of the French Water Company on Rue Lubin in the French Concession, he was unfortunately shot and killed by enemy soldiers with machine guns. There were a total of nine people observing at the site. Due to his professional duties, he stood in the front, holding a camera to capture the battle situation. The enemy soldiers concentrated their machine gun fire, which lasted for several minutes. He was hit by dozens of bullets in the head, chest, and abdomen, and was killed immediately. At the same time, Prario and Amelcher were seriously injured, and Thurauskv and Berg were slightly injured. The other four people were spared, but they were all frightened and fell on the tower, at a loss. According to reports, Stephen was British, only 33 years old, adventurous, and diligent in his duties. He had previously covered the war news in Spain and had made considerable contributions. He was transferred to Shanghai this time and had only been here for two months. He had recently received a telegram from London summoning him back to the country via the Siberian Railway, but he was sacrificed at the end of his mission. Chinese and foreign colleagues were deeply saddened and stood in silence for three minutes at 6:00 PM yesterday to express their condolences.

### Our Defense Line North of Guangfu Has Not Moved

Central News Agency Military Correspondent's report on the morning of the 10th (delayed): Our defense line north of Guangfu has not been affected by the changes in the battle line on the south bank of the Suzhou River. From yesterday on, the enemy began to attack our entire line fiercely, firing more than a thousand shells, as dense as machine guns. At the same time, hundreds of enemy troops attacked our line from Wangjiazhai and Zhangjiacun southwest of Luodian. After our army bravely fought back, they were finally defeated. This morning, the enemy near Guangfu again carried out harassing fire on our positions. Our army calmly returned fire, and every shot hit the target. The enemy suffered heavy casualties.

### The Loyalty and Bravery of Our Covering Troops

A special correspondent of the Central News Agency reported from the front at 1:30 PM on the 11th: Our covering troops encountered as many as 9,000 enemy soldiers at approximately 9:00 PM last night in areas such as Yangjia Yan, Yanjiatang, Wangjia Shi near the East Memorial Monument Road and Hongqiao Road of Hongqiao Airport. The enemy troops were forming ranks and advancing from Luobiegen Road and Hongju Road. Our troops, taking them by surprise, launched a sudden attack. The enemy dispersed and engaged us in a confrontation. After midnight, the battle intensified. The sound of artillery was very loud, and residents in the western district were awakened from their sleep. By 4:00 AM this morning, our troops had safely retreated. The enemy suffered heavy casualties in this engagement.

### Uncertainty Regarding Enemy Landing at Guanhaiwei

The news of enemy troops landing at Guanhaiwei on the south bank of the Qiantang River and advancing towards Yuyao has been published in newspapers, causing great concern among various parties. Yesterday morning, reporters inquired with relevant departments, and it was stated that telegrams had been received from the area, all stating that the event had not occurred. Yesterday morning, a newspaper reported that enemy troops had landed at Guanhaiwei in Ningbo (on the south bank of Hangzhou Bay). It is understood that Guanhaiwei is one of the three northern market towns, so-called because it is located in the northern regions of Yuyao, Cixi, and Zhenhai counties. Therefore, after the aforementioned news reached Shanghai, Ningbo natives residing in Shanghai were greatly alarmed, and the Ningbo Natives Association in Shanghai was particularly concerned. Yesterday morning, they telegraphed responsible parties in Ningbo to inquire. By noon, they had received a reply stating, 'To the Shanghai Ningbo Natives Association, the report of troops landing in Guanhaiwei is false. Do not worry.' After receiving the telegram, the association posted a notice in front of their building to reassure the Ningbo people in Shanghai. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, a certain shipping company in this city also received a telegram from the Deping vessel, currently in Ningbo, yesterday afternoon, confirming that the news of Japanese troops landing at Guanhaiwei was not factual.

### Chamber of Commerce Announces All Guilds Should Inspire Patriotic Sentiment

No Changes to Original Organization Permitted

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday announced to all industry guilds: Considering that this war of resistance is a sacred war to protect the motherland, all people, whether in war zones or non-war zones, should inspire patriotic sentiments, invigorate the spirit of resisting the enemy, and provide various material assistance to the soldiers at the front as a backing for the government's long-term resistance. All industrial, commercial, and other legally established civilian organizations in this city bear the responsibility of leading activities in society. During this extraordinary period, they should be unyielding and intensify their work. Regardless of how the war situation evolves, no changes to the original organization or cessation of work are permitted without the orders of the responsible authorities. Furthermore, to avoid personnel disputes, responsible personnel of all organizations, such as executive committee members, supervisors, directors, etc., should temporarily suspend re-elections and continue to be responsible, sharing the national crisis and completing their tasks to achieve final victory. The Chamber has high hopes for everyone's efforts to achieve final victory.

### British and American Military Leaders Officially Visit Matsui

### In the Waters of Daxie, Our Air Force Bombs Enemy Aircraft Carrier

Two Enemy Planes Shot Down Over the Capital

[Nanjing] A squadron of our air force flew to the waters of Daxie offshore on the morning of the 11th to bomb an enemy aircraft carrier. When our planes approached the airspace above the enemy ship, the enemy frantically fired guns and cannons. Our planes continued to circle, and after discovering thirteen planes parked on the ship, they formed a line and dropped bombs on the target simultaneously. The bombing was swift and the bombs ignited fires. When our air force began to return to base, they could still see flames from the stern of the ship rising high into the clouds. (Central News Agency dispatch, 11th)

[Nanjing] Nine enemy heavy bombers and nine fighters attacked Nanjing at 1:00 PM on the 11th. At 1:30 PM, seventeen enemy planes were spotted around Nanjing, flying very high. After careful firing by our anti-aircraft guns, several heavy bombers fled in panic to outside Guanghua Gate, dropping dozens of bombs before leaving. The remaining planes circled and scouted in the airspace above Nanjing. Six of them flew westward, and three flew southeast from the north. As they flew over the area outside Guanghua Gate, they flew higher. Our anti-aircraft guns aimed and fired. An enemy heavy bomber was hit and struggled to fly higher, attempting to escape. However, the fuselage was already on fire and could not be sustained. It gradually fell from the sky, with two red lights and a wisp of thick smoke, creating a spectacle. Observers praised it. The remaining planes, seeing the situation, fled in panic. After investigation, the wreckage of the plane fell near the Daxiao Field, the fuselage was completely destroyed, and the combat crew and pilot were killed. (Central News Agency dispatch, 11th)

[Nanjing] Enemy planes attacked the capital again today. An alert was issued at 1:40 PM. Fifteen minutes later, nine heavy bombers and six fighters flew in from the east. Three heavy bombers went straight to the south city, bombing the airfield at Guanghua Gate and a certain point several miles outside the south gate. A large fire broke out, with thick smoke rising. Another three heavy bombers bombed various locations outside the south city. At the same time, six fighters circled the northwest sky to protect the bombers. Although the anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely, they did not seriously threaten the enemy planes. Before long, the planes flew away, and then another bomber flew directly to the center of the city from the south. The plane was one of those participating in the bombing of the airfield outside Guanghua Gate. Because there were still bombs left in the plane, it returned to the airfield to unload them. Therefore, the anti-aircraft guns on all sides targeted the plane and fired at it. As the plane was flying back south before reaching its destination, an anti-aircraft shell passed straight through between its wings. The plane immediately emitted orange flames and fell downwards, exploding in the sky and splitting into three sections. The three trails of smoke rising from the landing site were met with applause from observers on the ground. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch, 11th)

### Seeking Allies and Uniting the People

Chairman Wang's Published Essay

[Nanjing] Chairman Wang published an essay today entitled "Seeking Allies and Uniting the People." The original text is as follows:

During the war of resistance, two things need to be paid attention to: seeking allies and uniting the people. These two things are necessary in ordinary times, and even more urgent during the war of resistance. First, let's talk about seeking allies. In the declaration of the Third Plenary Session, there is a sentence, "Advance along the path of international peace." This sentence indicates our current diplomatic policy. So-called international peace is not general, its greatest meaning is to oppose aggression, and its manifestations include the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, etc. China has never had any facts of aggression against others in history. In the current environment, China is working hard to complete the construction of a modern country, just as President Sun Yat-sen declared when he took office as the first president that China should fulfill the obligations that a civilized country should fulfill and enjoy the rights that a civilized country should enjoy. It is also as stated in his will that China's freedom and equality. Therefore, China sincerely abides by the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact in order to maintain world peace and justice, and at the same time to strive for China in the environment of maintaining world peace and justice, to complete the task of building a modern country. Since the September 18th Incident, China has submitted the Sino-Japanese issue to the League of Nations, and to this day China is participating in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, all based on this consistent policy. To summarize, it is to advance along the path of international peace. This is not general, it is to oppose aggression. Now the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has begun in Belgium. Let us first discuss this point. Why was the Nine-Power Treaty convened at this time? Since the September 18th Incident, some people have advocated submitting the Sino-Japanese issue to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, but later it was submitted to the League of Nations. The reason is that the League of Nations Covenant has sanctions against violating countries. If Japan is judged to be an aggressor and Japan refuses to obey, economic sanctions will be imposed on Japan, etc. On the other hand, the Nine-Power Treaty does not have sanctions provisions. According to Article 7, disputes can only be discussed. At that time, the reason for submitting the Sino-Japanese issue to the League of Nations instead of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference was really this. When the League of Nations sent an investigation team, it also invited a representative from the United States to participate. After the Lytton Report was submitted, although the League of Nations did not judge Japan to be an aggressor and impose sanctions, it had already judged that Japan's advance into Northeast China was not out of self-defense. Conversely, if it is not out of self-defense, what is it if not aggression? At this League of Nations meeting, Japan's advance into the Hebei provinces of China and Shanghai, as well as the abuse of aircraft to bomb the capital of China and other places, have been effectively condemned. The firm resistance of China has been given deep sympathy, but Japan has still not been clearly judged as an aggressor and given economic sanctions. The reason is that last year's economic sanctions against Italy's invasion of Abyssinia were not effective, so it is so cautious. However, Japan's recklessness not only harms China, but also harms world peace, which is what all countries that advocate peace and justice cannot tolerate. Therefore, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference was initiated. This is worthy of attention for peace and justice. Now, some people are optimistic about the future of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, and some people are pessimistic. The optimistic view is that this conference, in addition to the original signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, also invited the Soviet Union and Germany to participate. These powerful countries, when they meet, will definitely strive for peace and justice to the end, so that aggressive Japan can no longer act wildly. The pessimistic view is that the purpose of this Nine-Power Treaty Conference is to mediate. How can this mediation case be established? If it is acceptable to China, it may not be what Japan wants to hear. If it suits Japan's taste, it may not be what China can tolerate. If Japan is forced to compromise with China, strength must be used. If China is forced to compromise with Japan, it is not justified in terms of principle. These two different views can be said to be well-founded. However, the reason why China is determined to participate in the conference this time is that it fully believes that the motive of this conference is to maintain peace and justice. In this conference, Japan will be increasingly isolated due to Japan's barbaric aggression, and China will receive more sympathy from the world due to China's firm resistance and strike at the aggressor. Japan has now brazenly refused to participate in this conference, and its isolated state has been fully exposed. In the future, if the countries propose reasonable plans in the conference, and Japan still ignores and refuses them brazenly, then its willingness to be a criminal who destroys justice and peace will be fully exposed and become an enemy of the world. In this way, China's war of resistance this time is to oppose Japan's aggression, not only to fulfill its responsibility for its own survival, but also to fulfill its responsibility for the world's justice and peace. It is precisely following the consistent diplomatic policy of advancing along the path of international peace, and the purpose of all countries in convening the Nine-Power Treaty Conference at this time is to maintain the situation of international peace. No matter what words it uses, such as mediation or arbitration, its purpose is to oppose aggression and maintain peace, which is extremely upright and clear. Therefore, China today is in line with Mencius' saying that "the virtuous have many helpers." Seeking allies is a more favorable trend. At present, there are the signatory countries of the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact supporting the international peace situation, and Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union are the center of gravity. Since the September 18th Incident, Britain, the United States, and France have been opposing aggression and maintaining peace, and Japan's aggression against China not only harms China, but also threatens Britain, the United States, and France, and there are common points of interest. The situation in the Soviet Union is even more urgent. In the past, both countries have undergone the work of preparing themselves. For example, in the twenty-first year, although China and the Soviet Union had restored diplomatic relations, the Soviet Union had sold the Chinese Eastern Railway to Japan because it was immersed in the two five-year economic construction plans, and had exchanged consuls with the puppet state of Manchukuo. Because China was immersed in unification construction and various necessary preparations, since the Tanggu Truce Agreement, it often could not bear the gradual aggression of Japan, but still endured it. These are all due to the situation. However, since China's all-out war of resistance began, the Soviet Union has signed a non-aggression treaty with China, and the diplomatic relations between the two countries have been further combined. The aggression of Japan makes China and the Soviet Union feel common interests. This feeling is undoubtedly becoming increasingly deep due to the increasingly fierce aggression of Japan. Recently, quite a few people have held the view that China must abandon its trust in capitalist countries in order to obtain the real assistance of the Soviet Union. This view has been seen in several publications in Shanghai. Your brother believes that this view cannot clearly see the current path of international peace, and cannot clearly see that China must advance along the current path of international peace. Not to mention anything else, I am afraid that the Soviet Union will be startled when it hears this, and it will shrug its shoulders and stick out its tongue. Without looking at anything else, just look at the diplomacy of the Soviet Union. Why did the Soviet Union join the League of Nations? Why did the Soviet Union sign a mutual assistance agreement with France? Why is the Soviet Union so eager to improve friendship with Britain and the United States? There is no country in the world that does not pay attention to its own survival. If it pays attention to its own survival, it will not prevent itself from falling into isolation, especially no country. (To be continued)

### Cultural Street Scenes Since the War of Resistance (Part 2)

— Huai Qing

㊂ Periodicals

During the first two weeks of the war, the large and small bookstores along Henan Road to Fourth Horse Road were tightly shut with iron gates, some only 'half-open.' Clearly, there were no customers. Publications and magazines had also come to a standstill; one could hardly find a fresh publication at the newsstands. Of course, in a suddenly erupting era of turmoil, temporary disorder and disarray are unavoidable. However, before long, the publishing industry gradually struggled back to its feet.

The wartime special edition of "Guo Wen Zhou Bao" (National News Weekly) and "Kang Zhan" (Resistance), edited by Tao Fen, were the first to appear on the streets. Their content was also quite rich, and those who usually enjoyed reading magazines felt as if they had found a treasure. Later, new publications emerged one after another, and the existing magazines also jointly released wartime special editions. There were at least five or six types of pictorials with similar names such as "War Pictorials" and "Resistance Pictorials." Undoubtedly, these publications were the best spiritual sustenance for the public during the War of Resistance.

Among the temporary special editions of various magazines, the joint ten-day edition of "World Knowledge," "China Tribune," "National Weekly," and "Women's Life" was comparatively superior in printing and content. Unfortunately, it was always late, and its sales were far less than those of "Guo Wen Zhou Bao." The first two or three issues of "Cultural Warfront" were very popular, but later it received little attention. "Kang Zhan" has now been renamed "Di Kang" (Resistance), presumably in preparation for long-term publication. The content seems a bit empty, far from the popularity of the former "Popular Life," "Life Weekly," and others.

Soft publications are clearly in a state of decline. "Wen Xue" (Literature), "Guang Ming" (Light), "Yi Wen" (Translation), and "Zhong Liu" (Midstream), although jointly publishing a weekly (initially named "Na Han" (Outcry), later renamed "Feng Huo" (Beacon Fire)), a small publication with a newspaper sheet folded into a booklet, seems unlikely to attract attention even with brilliant production. In addition, there is another "Guang Ming" of the same type, but its content is even inferior to "Feng Huo." Now "Wen Xue" has been separately changed to a small special edition, and its quality is much more substantial than "Feng Huo." Sales should be quite good. In the past, the literary and art circles shouted slogans such as 'National Defense Literature.' Now is the time for practical application. Writers should unite more and seize the current great and extraordinary period to produce more genuine and valuable anti-Japanese literature! I believe that if China is to produce great works, then this is precisely the time when writers should earnestly strive to create great works!

What should be especially mentioned here is the 'Special Joint Issue for Extraordinary Times' of "Cosmic Wind," "West Wind," and "Yi Jing." It is indeed outstanding among soft publications, maintaining its style of 'saying something of substance.' Moreover, "Cosmic Wind," like 'a flower on a lonely cliff,' was soon relaunched, changing from a bi-monthly to a ten-day publication, and its quality remained the same. Recently, it has added two major works, 'Feng Yuxiang's Autobiography' and Chen Duxiu's 'Shi'an's Autobiography,' which will undoubtedly add many new readers. Each issue also has several excellent essays on the War of Resistance, which are well worth reading. "West Wind" has also been relaunched recently, changing from a monthly to a bi-monthly. It is the best translated Western magazine. "Yi Jing" will also be restored soon. In short, the spirit of the "Cosmic Wind" series is something that all magazine publishers should admire. They truly practice the motto of 'doing things earnestly.' And their 'business sense' is also particularly brilliant. A friend said: 'Running a magazine should be like "Cosmic Wind,"' which is indeed not an overstatement.

"Wen Zhai" (Literary Digest) has reduced its size, changed to a ten-day publication, and continues to be published. The content is still very good. "Yue Bao" (Monthly) has ceased publication. Subsequently, a "Kang Zhan Ban Yue Kan" (Resistance Bi-monthly) was produced, following the style of "Yue Bao." It is said that the editor is a member of the "Yue Bao" editorial team and is published by Beixin Bookstore. The size has been reduced considerably.

Now "World Knowledge," "National Questions," "Women's Life," and other magazines of Life Bookstore have also returned to their original state. The Zhongshan Cultural and Educational Center's "Current Affairs Compilation" also publishes a "Wartime Special Issue," indicating that orthodox political and diplomatic publications are slowly recovering. The Literary Monthly of Zhengzhong Bookstore also continues to be published. This is the first recovery of pure literary publications. The cultural street scene is presenting a vibrant atmosphere again!

### Tokyo Government's Reply Expected to be Sent Today

[London] Japanese sources here have confirmed that their government will submit a reply to the application submitted by the Nine-Power Treaty Conference at the end of this week, generally refusing it with euphemistic words and explaining two points: ㊀ This application is likely an expression of countries with no direct relation to the Far East interfering in Japanese affairs; ㊁ It is necessary to obtain sufficient information on whether the Chinese government hopes for peace. These Japanese sources also said that it would be more convenient if one or several major countries could come forward individually to mediate. Although the rumor that Germany is mediating the Sino-Japanese dispute is unbelievable, the German government may be welcomed by the Japanese government if it has this intention, but China is likely to reject it.

China, the most peace-loving country in the world, has been invaded by a strong neighbor. Not only invading, but even massacring civilians and violating treaties and international law. If such acts of aggression are still tolerated, other countries will inevitably suffer the consequences immediately, because the modern world is an international society with shared interests. What is hoped is that peace-loving countries will rise up to pursue the aggressor and prevent aggression, and formulate an economic, moral, and diplomatic sanctions plan against the forces of violence and chaos, so that those engaged in war cannot profit from it.'

It is said that the three politicians believe that there is no certainty about the Japanese reply to the application submitted by the Nine-Power Conference a few days ago, so they should agree on recommendations so that when the Japanese reply is received, they can be presented without wasting time. There is now little doubt that the Japanese government will bluntly reject the application. What is undecided is whether the door to continued negotiations is still open. The Japanese side said that it will not stop military action without complete victory, but China is also determined to continue the war and will not show weakness.

[Moscow] The Soviet government newspaper "Izvestia" recently commented on the Anti-Comintern Pact between Italy, Germany, and Japan, stating, "It is well known that Italy only occupies a secondary position regarding the German and Japanese preparations for war against the Soviet Union.

### Czech Foreign Minister Explains Foreign Policy

Maintain Friendship with France and Russia

⊙Prague: Foreign Minister Krofta gave a speech to the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses of Parliament today, stating, "Since I last delivered a diplomatic speech, the various difficulties in the diplomatic field have increased day by day. The principles of the League of Nations have been gradually abandoned, and the principle of non-interference has taken its place. Regional agreements are prevalent for a time, and the principle of collective security is bleak. The Spanish incident is an example. In the Czech Republic, its foreign policy should still be based on respecting the Covenant of the League of Nations and international law. Regarding the Spanish issue, it should especially respect the 'Spain belongs to the Spanish' principle. In short, the ideals embraced by the Czech Republic in diplomacy are in line with the views expressed by the US President in Chicago. As for the relationship between the Czech Republic and other countries in the region, it is generally satisfactory. Foreigners often say that the Little Entente is internally scattered, which is absolutely unbelievable. The relationship between the Czech Republic and Hungary has greatly improved. Representatives of Hungary and the Little Entente held talks in Geneva during the League of Nations General Assembly. The friendship between the Czech Republic and Austria is also very close. As for the relationship between the Czech Republic and the Soviet Union, it is evolving on a normal path. There are no new facts to report regarding the relationship between the Czech Republic and Poland. Finally, regarding the Czech Republic and Germany, although German newspapers have recently attacked the Czech Republic, it has not affected the Czech Republic. The Czech and German governments still maintain normal relations financially, technically, and economically. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 11th)

Current Commentary

### The Obligation to Aid Fellow Countrymen in Distress

— Yi

Since the start of the all-out War of Resistance, those of our fellow countrymen in the war zones who are under the trampling of the enemy, struggling in starvation and cold, just in Shanghai and its surrounding areas, number no less than several millions. Although Chinese and foreign charitable organizations have made efforts to provide relief and resettlement, it is merely a drop in the bucket, and the effect is ultimately limited. If the lives of these refugees are not resolved, the consequences are unimaginable.

We believe that for this issue, the government should make overall plans and seek proper solutions. But every national citizen with ample means must also ask themselves whether they are indifferent to this issue, and whether they have fulfilled their responsibility to rescue the unfortunate fellow countrymen in distress. If they have not fulfilled their responsibility, they must economize on food and clothing, save money, and maintain their lives. This is what it means to be worthy of the country and worthy of the nation.

Everyone must know that our entire nation is one body. During this sacred all-out War of Resistance, the disasters suffered by our fellow countrymen in the war zones are all the price of exchanging for national survival and national glory. In other words, they are suffering for the benefit of all our people for generations to come. Therefore, helping them is not just charity, but an unavoidable obligation. If one only cares about one's own personal and family pleasures and ignores the displacement of fellow countrymen in the war zones, then one cannot escape the serious condemnation of conscience.

### Commemorating Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Birthday Amidst the War of Resistance

— Zhang Zhirang

The Chinese nation produced the great leader Mr. Sun Yat-sen, which propelled decades of revolutionary torrents and waves.

Now, as we are adhering to Mr. Sun’s principles and carrying out the national war of resistance, and coinciding with Mr. Sun's birthday, how should we reflect on Mr. Sun's teachings and how should we commemorate him?

We should commemorate Mr. Sun by striving to complete the unfinished cause he undertook!

The starting point of Mr. Sun's cause was to restore the nation's status and save it from extinction. To achieve this goal, there are two tasks that need to be carried out with all our might. The first is to overthrow the Manchu Qing Dynasty, and the second is to seek liberation from the oppression of imperialism. The first task was completed twenty-six years ago under Mr. Sun’s great leadership. The second task is precisely the matter that Mr. Sun instructed us to attend to in his will.

Because of Japan's unique and fierce aggression over the past six years, this matter has evolved from complex to simple, and from scattered to concentrated—the source of oppression suffered by our nation has converged on Japanese imperialism alone. The expansion of Japan's aggressive forces in the Far East not only threatens China, but also makes the great powers with larger interests in China feel uneasy. Because these great powers feel threatened from various quarters, they have been striving to maintain peace and are no longer obstacles to our national revival. The goal of our country's national revolution from now on is only Japanese imperialism. The day of final victory against Japan will be the day the national revolution is accomplished.

However, the cause Mr. Sun Yat-sen wanted to complete was not limited to the single matter of national revolution. In addition, democracy and people's livelihood are also equally important issues. Moreover, the War of Resistance is not about putting everything else aside and only focusing on military affairs. I remember that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, in his speech to the Lushan Summer Training Corps on July 18th this year, particularly emphasized that our country should now build the nation based on the Three Principles of the People amidst the War of Resistance. This statement is indeed profoundly insightful in terms of political philosophy. Now that the War of Resistance has long begun, our country should follow the path pointed out by Generalissimo Chiang, and promote the realization of the Principles of Democracy and People's Livelihood in the midst of the national war.

On the birthday of this great revolutionary leader in the history of the Chinese nation, we see that the Japanese imperial army has entered Shandong from the Jinpu Railway, Henan from the Pinghan Railway, and Shanxi Taiyuan from the Zhengtai Railway in North China; surrounded Greater Shanghai in East China, and directly scurried along the Huhang Railway from Jinshanwei. The situation of the War of Resistance has unfolded a new situation due to the daily expansion of the battle lines. To cope with this new situation, our country must immediately expand from the entire army's resistance to the entire people's resistance. This is a crucial key to determining the success or failure of the War of Resistance. In the midst of carrying out the entire people's resistance, our country should, based on the Principle of Democracy, implement democratic politics during the War of Resistance, so that the entire country is united as one; and should, based on the Principle of People's Livelihood, solve the people's livelihood problems during the War of Resistance, so that the people of the whole country can work together to resist the enemy. Only in this way can we cooperate with the military to ensure the final victory of the War of Resistance. Only in this way can it be considered the implementation of Generalissimo Chiang's instruction to build the nation amidst the War of Resistance.

From today onwards, we should vow to complete Mr. Sun Yat-sen's unfinished cause in this way to forever commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen's annual birthday!

### Sudden Coup in Brazil Establishes Dictatorial Regime

President promulgates new constitution

Capital of Brazil: A sudden coup took place here today. President Vargas has implemented a dictatorial system with immediate effect, and issued a letter to the army generals in the evening, saying that a new constitution should be promulgated, and the principles on which it is based should be adapted to the international situation. If we only revise the original democratic system, it will not be enough to cope with the current situation. (Central News Agency, Havana, 16th)

Capital of Brazil: All public institutions in Brazil, such as the National Congress, State Assemblies, and City Councils, have now been dissolved by the newly promulgated constitution. According to the official gazette, this new constitution aims to protect national peace and will be submitted to the National Assembly for decision. The new constitution stipulates the establishment of a National Economic Advisory Council in addition to the National Congress. Brazilian President Dr. Vargas announced in a radio broadcast that foreign debts would be temporarily suspended. Dr. Vargas assumed the presidency and presided over the provisional government after army uprisings in various places on November 3, 1930, forced the former president to resign. In July 1934, a new constitution was passed, declaring the establishment of the Second Republic of Brazil. The difference between this Second Republic and the First Republic lies in granting great power to the state, which can control industry, gradually nationalize banks and insurance companies, and exclusively operate any industry when deemed necessary. Great power is concentrated in the House of Representatives, with a total of 300 members, serving a four-year term, of which 150 are elected by direct vote of the people, and the remaining 50 are representatives of vocational groups such as agriculture, industry, and commerce. The Senate has only 42 members, with two members elected from each state and special district, serving an eight-year term, and important legislative powers belong to it. The president serves a four-year term and cannot be re-elected after the term expires. This time, Dr. Vargas suddenly promulgated a new constitution, causing the Senate and House of Representatives to dissolve automatically. Some say that Dr. Vargas's move stems from personal ambition to protect his power and create a corporatist state, but this has nothing to do with European fascist countries. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 12th)

Capital of Brazil: After the promulgation of the new constitution in Brazil, President Vargas and his cabinet have apparently implemented a dictatorial regime. All government organizations produced by electoral methods, such as the National Congress, the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the councils of various states and cities, have been completely dissolved by the President. This change in the political situation is closely related to the coffee issue. The President has reimplemented the martial law that was cancelled in mid-September. As for important opposition figures, they have already fled to other countries. (10th, National Telegraph)

Democratic politics exist only in name

[New York] Information about political parties in Brazil received here is quite scarce. It is reported that President Vargas will serve as president for life. After the implementation of the new constitution in Brazil, the country will become an omnipotent state based on vocational groups, and will moderately maintain the form of a republic. It is rumored that Brazil will join the Anti-Comintern Pact of Italy, Germany, and Japan. This claim has been denied by the Brazilian Embassy in the United States. (Central News Agency, Havana, 10th)

Major blow to Pan-Americanism

[Washington] American observers have commented on the Brazilian coup, saying that the country has always been inclined to democratic governance, but now it has changed course, which is of great importance. As far as the United States is concerned, Secretary of State Hull's achievements at last year's Pan-American Peace Conference were based on democratic systems and combined with countries in Central and South America. If Brazil establishes a dictatorial system and becomes ideologically closer to Italy, or even joins the Anti-Comintern Pact of Italy, Germany, and Japan, then Pan-Americanism will suffer a major blow. (Central News Agency, Havana, 10th)

People in Rome are very satisfied

[Rome] Regarding the coup in Brazil, the general public in Italy, after hearing the news, believes that this is the result of the development of fascism and is therefore very satisfied. They also believe that although Brazil will not join the Anti-Comintern Pact of Italy, Germany, and Japan for the time being, judging from the country's political evolution, the matter of joining is likely to be realized sooner. (Central News Agency, Havana, 11th)

Most state governors remain in office

After Brazil implemented a dictatorial system, except for the governors of the two states of Bahia and Pernambuco, who left their posts, the rest remained in their original positions. Justice Minister Campos recently gave an interview to a Havas reporter. (Brazil is now extremely quiet. The people of the whole country have accepted the new situation after the coup and expressed satisfaction and trust. The new constitution promulgated by the government adapts to Brazil's economic and social needs. According to the new constitution, people of all classes should be reorganized in accordance with the principles of the vocational group system. Although we do not seek to be radical, we should seek practical results. (Central News Agency, Havana, 11th)

### Former Belgian Foreign Minister Fails to Form Cabinet

Because the Catholic Party refuses to cooperate, the activities of the Fascist leader are noteworthy

Brussels: Two weeks have passed since the Zeeland Cabinet resigned, and a new cabinet has not yet been formed. Mr. Spaak, the current chairman of the Nine-Power Conference, was the fourth person ordered to form a cabinet. He originally had hopes of success, but at the last minute, there was a sudden setback, so Mr. Spaak has now given up. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 11th)

Brussels: The reason for Mr. Spaak's failure to form a cabinet is the Catholic Party's refusal to cooperate. Mr. Spaak had invited Mr. Pierlot to serve as foreign minister. Mr. Pierlot had once failed to form a cabinet and refused to join the cabinet. Therefore, the Catholic Party all seem to have a trend of not cooperating with the Socialist Party. In this regard, people are generally paying attention to the Belgian fascist leader Degrelle, who has been frequently interacting with Catholic Party and conservative politicians in recent days.

### Anglo-American Trade Agreement Negotiations Proceed Smoothly

[Washington] Assistant Secretary of State Welles declared today that he is very optimistic about the prospects for an Anglo-American trade agreement. It is said that the trade agreement negotiations are progressing quite smoothly. British Trade Minister Stanley recently stated that the important points of this trade agreement negotiation should lie in the direct factual commercial impact and in the exploration of various commercial issues between Britain and the United States. The difficulty lies in the fact that American interests are similar to those of the British Commonwealth and the signatories of the Ottawa Agreement. "But the United States is also well aware that the principles of the Ottawa Agreement do not cause problems because of this, so there is no intention to abandon the system of imperial preference."

### Fierce Winds Rage in the Philippines

[Manila] A fierce wind occurred here tonight, causing hundreds of office workers to be unable to return home. The streets were flooded, many trees were blown down, and telephone and electricity supply was partially cut off. Traffic was almost completely interrupted. According to the latest news, the hurricane is fifty miles outside the port and will not blow here. The British ship "Kinnear Weir" sent out a request for assistance this morning, saying that it had been blown ashore by a hurricane at Cape Dinaguan on the Pacific coast of Luzon. It is currently impossible to send a ship to rescue it. The ship is obviously stranded on the beach and is currently not in danger. The ship's wireless machine was damaged, so the details of its distress cannot be ascertained. The coastal freighter "Atlantic Gulf" is currently closest to the ship and has been asked to go to rescue it. According to earlier reports, the wind and waves at sea are treacherous. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 11th)

Manila: The fierce wind that occurred here last night stopped at 8 pm tonight. When the wind was at its strongest, the speed was over sixty miles per hour. The most severely affected areas were the central and Luzon provinces. However, traffic was interrupted, and the details are unknown. As far as is known, several people have died in this disaster, including four who were electrocuted to death by broken power lines, and three fishermen who drowned in the bay.

### Anti-British Sentiment Runs High in Japan

[Tokyo] The Yomiuri Shimbun stated in an article today that "Japan's main enemy in the current conflict is actually Britain." This declaration is undoubtedly doubtful in the eyes of conservatives, but it is enough to prove the recent surge in anti-British sentiment in Japan. The newspaper continued to say that unless this enemy behind the scenes is demoted to a considerable position, all attempts to stop the conflict will be ineffective because of its obstruction.

### The Situation When Fengxian Retreats in Pain Under Attack on Three Sides

Avoiding artillery fire but encountering looting, refugees are displaced and request provincial subsidies

According to reports from refugees who escaped from Fengxian, heavy troops were stationed in Fengxian. Now, because they are attacked on three sides, and limited by the situation, they are unable to resist and have retreated in pain. When the enemy at Jinshanwei landed, it coincided with the redeployment of a certain general headquarters and a certain division. The enemy took advantage of the situation and entered the void, and the momentum spread like wildfire. For several days on the 5th, 6th, and 7th, enemy planes dropped bombs everywhere (all newly built in July 1937, with extremely powerful explosive force). The local area had long been in chaos. At 6 pm on the 6th, a certain division suddenly retreated. At 2 am on the 7th, a certain brigade was ordered to rush from Chuansha on foot to reinforce. A certain division also returned overnight, deploying defenses on the left and right wings in Xinxin City, west of Zhuanghang, to encircle and suppress. On the other hand, County Magistrate Yu Xilai, together with the Security Brigade Captain Zhou Zhizhen, was ordered to defend strongholds along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway and the newly built highway from Tinglin to Nanqiao, planning to carry out guerrilla warfare when necessary. Unexpectedly, before they could gain a firm foothold, they suddenly received reports of enemy tracks on Tuolin, Qianjiaqiao, and the coast. Our army, in view of the strategic situation of being attacked on three sides and unable to resist, retreated first at 1 pm on the 7th. At 5 pm, a certain division continued to cross the Pu River. The Liu Brigade of that division also retreated under cover at 7 pm. At the same time, the commando disbanded the strong men and retreated to Zha Port. County Magistrate Yu, with the permission of a certain division during the general retreat of the army, took more than 100 security police at 2 am on the 8th, first destroyed the highway bridges, and then automatically burned down the various important agencies before retreating to Beiqiao. Zhang Xinjian, a member of the Standing Committee of the county party department, also felt unable to maintain the situation and was forced to retreat to Shanghai. After the enemy army fought at the Xiaozhoujia Tomb, they gradually probed from Shengzimiao, Daijiaqiao, Zhuangxing Town, and the coastal enemy teams of Tuolin Qianjiaqiao, all adding reinforcements to Zhapu and Songjiang, but did not deploy a real attack force. Even in Nanhui and other places, there were no traces of the enemy, because the situation had been created as if they were turtles in a jar, and it was possible to swallow them without spending a single bullet, so there was no need to rush to advance. This incident was unexpected. Although the people did not suffer from the disaster of artillery fire, bandits rose up everywhere and looted everywhere. Even in remote rural areas, it was difficult to avoid. This is the inevitable stage in the midst of chaos, and there is nothing to mention. However, the most painful thing is that when the enemy fiercely attacked Jinshanwei, Caoging, and Xiaozhoujia Tomb, our army bravely resisted and suffered many casualties. However, there were no burial and treatment facilities nearby. Only the Hujiaqiao Red Sub-Association and the emergency rescue team organized in Zhuanghang were short of medicine and unable to distribute them. This caused the bodies of the brave men who sacrificed for the country to be exposed, and the wounded groaned along the road, unable to be rescued. When the entire retreat took place, the wounded soldiers in Nanqiao and other places were not able to be transported out one by one due to the haste, which was heartbreaking and tragic. How can we comfort the loyal souls? Thinking of this, I cannot help but shed tears. Although the county's land tax for this period has been levied, the people competed to pay it in the midst of the tense situation, and more than half of it has been exceeded. In addition to borrowing 40,000 yuan for national salvation bonds, cash purchases have also reached 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Other donations are also numerous. The heart of serving the country is still comforting. It is heard that all important documents of various agencies, as well as Xinhua, Nongmin, and Puhai Banks, were completely removed in a hurry. Postmaster Tao Longming handled it especially quickly and without any damage. As of yesterday, tens of thousands of refugees have fled. County Magistrate Yu has joined local people such as Cai Jianfu to set up a refugee relief center. However, due to the difficulty in raising funds, he telegraphed Chairman Chen Wen last night, saying, "Enemy troops are pressing in, and Shangsong has fallen one after another. Fengxian has suffered even more. The refugees have fled in a hurry and only saved themselves. They are wandering in Shanghai and number in the tens of thousands. They are eating wind and sleeping in dew, and are suffering from cold and hunger. The county magistrate is heartbroken to see this. He has joined with local gentry in Shanghai to organize a relief center. However, under this situation, there is no way to raise funds. Everyone agreed that the county treasury is extremely tight and has to allocate a portion of the provincial funds of more than 30,000 yuan under the temporary deposit account of the treasury to subsidize the relief of the disaster victims and maintain their lives. The local people in Shanghai have also telegraphed to the provincial government to appeal. On the one hand, they have pushed Shen Menglian and Cheng Weiyu to the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association to request assistance. If this is achieved, then the lives of tens of thousands of refugees in the shortest period of time may have a glimmer of hope."

### Large Group of Students in Brussels Demonstrate at Japanese Embassy

Thousands of people sign letters to the Japanese ambassador, protesting the destruction of our cultural institutions

Brussels: A large group of students here demonstrated outside the Japanese embassy today. Many people were subsequently arrested by the police, including the president of the Student Union and many other staff members. Students in Brussels originally planned to organize a parade to present the Japanese ambassador with a protest signed by a thousand students, opposing the systematic destruction of educational and cultural institutions by the Japanese army in China. The students then gathered at the police station again to hold a demonstration, causing the police to have to request military police to suppress them before dispersing the students. It is also heard that after the student protest, the Japanese embassy issued a statement saying, "Japan has done its utmost in humanitarian and cultural work in China," and that the sections mentioned by the students are "despicable and ridiculous." What Belgian students should be concerned about is the resolution of the existing disputes in Europe. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 10th)

### Refugees in Nanshi are in a Tragic Situation

The French Concession Iron Gate is Tightly Closed Separating Traffic - Tens of Thousands of Refugees Awaiting for Two Days and Nights

Cries of Hunger and Cold, a Miserable Scene - Father Jacquinot Experiences the Suffering Himself

The Shanghai war has shifted westward, affecting Nanshi. Yesterday, enemy planes bombed indiscriminately from morning till night. Residents in the southern part of the city moved north to take refuge. In order to maintain security within the concession, the police authorities of the French Concession closed the iron gates at the Sino-French border in turns. At the Lao Beimen (Old North Gate), refugees were allowed to pass through the iron shed to enter the concession. However, at the Nanyang Bridge iron shed, only residents of the concession were allowed to pass through the iron shed to enter the Chinese territory. This cycle of separating traffic resulted in tens of thousands of refugees thronging on the side of the Minguo Road, with some of them having escaped the morning before and waiting for two days and nights without being able to enter the concession. Women, children, and infants cried out for hunger and cold, a miserable scene. Among them were five or six hundred refugees from Caohejing. At 2 pm yesterday, the town's municipal committee managed to purchase food, which was lowered and delivered from a small shop counter on the French Concession side bordering the Chinese territory. The propertied class and charitable organizations in the French Concession also purchased bread, pancakes, and steamed buns and sent people to throw them out from the iron gate to distribute to the refugees for their hunger. At 3 pm, the organizers in the refugee area ordered the opening of the gate of the foreign cemetery outside Dongxin Bridge Street, outside Nine Acres (a location in Shanghai), along Minguo Road, and took in more than 2,000 refugees to await placement. In the refugee area in the city, about four or five hundred refugees crossed into the concession from the iron gate on Dongzi Laihuo Street. The refugee area north of Fangbang Road, which was established at noon on the 9th, has only been three days old. Water and electricity were cut off, and food was not supplied. It housed about 50,000 refugees, who have not had a meal for dozens of hours, which is of great concern to people at home and abroad in the city. The Shanghai International Relief Committee convened a meeting of various reception organizations at the YMCA at 4 pm yesterday. Chairman Qu Wenliu reported that the refugees in Nanshi had not had a meal for three days and the tragic scene of waiting outside the iron gate. It was immediately decided that: ㊀ Father Jacquinot, a member of the International Relief Committee, should request the French Concession authorities to open the iron gate as much as possible to facilitate the delivery of food to relieve the starving people. ㊁ The refugees already sent to the refugee area will be responsible for reception by the Relief Committee Shanghai Branch, the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association, and the Charity Federation. ㊂ The food supply of various charitable organizations should be concentrated in the International Relief Committee so that the committee can send it to the refugee area. It is heard that the tap water in the refugee area was cleared last night. Yesterday was the Emperor of Italy's birthday. The Italian commander stationed in Shanghai also accompanied many adjutants, carrying a large number of bread and canned food, to the reception center of the Municipal War Zone Refugee Relief Committee to distribute to the refugees. The chairman of the committee, Qu Wenliu, and the director of the negotiation department, Yu Xiangqin, accompanied and received them, expressing deep gratitude for the loving spirit of the Italian people.

The North China Daily News reported that the Nanshi Civilian Safety Zone Management Committee held a meeting yesterday (10th) at the committee's Nanshi office. The committee plans to have one member stationed at the office at all times to ensure the implementation of the various conditions in the committee's statements. Yesterday, bombs dropped by Japanese planes and artillery shells fired by the Japanese army landed near Fangbang Road, the southern boundary of the Civilian Safety Zone. Red Cross flags are hung high around the area. When Nanshi was attacked, Father Jacquinot, the chairman of the committee, never left Nanshi.

### No Food in the Refugee Area

According to reports from Cai Yunsheng and Hu Donggen, members of the Seventh Rescue Team last night, there are currently more than 40,000 refugees in the refugee area in the city. Men, women, old and young are gathered in one place, a tragic scene. In particular, food is cut off, and they have not had a meal for two days. Life is on the verge of danger, and many children have starved to death. Yesterday, Lu Bohong negotiated with the French Concession authorities to open the iron gate, but to no avail. It is hoped that philanthropists and kind-hearted people will quickly find ways to provide relief and negotiate appropriate solutions with the French authorities so that tens of thousands of lives will not all become starving corpses. It is a work of immeasurable merit.

### City Chamber of Commerce Urges Grain Businesses to Diligently Regulate Food Supply for the People

Measures to Unload Rice Ships Docked in the Nanshi Area, Concessions Authorities Resume Procurement from Overseas, Social Bureau Strictly Prohibits Price Gouging

The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, in accordance with an order from the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, states that the Civil Food Regulation Committee has now concluded its work. The Chamber of Commerce will now be responsible for matters related to civil food regulation, and will oversee various grain industry associations in handling these matters carefully. Although the Regulation Committee has ended, during this period of tense situation and obstructed transportation, civil food regulation remains crucial. Subsequently, the city's Rice and Bean Industry, Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry, Rice Shop Industry, and Flour Factory trade associations should consult with each other at any time and handle all matters carefully to maintain the food supply for the people.

Shanghai Flour Stock Adequate

After the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce received orders to supervise various rice industry groups in regulating the food supply for the people of Shanghai, the Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Rice Shop Industry Association not only publicly announced that rice prices should not exceed fourteen yuan, but also took measures to unload rice from rice ships that had arrived in Shanghai and were docked at the Nanshi rice industry docks. At the same time, they sought to purchase rice from inland areas and transport it to Shanghai for regulation. Yesterday, rice shops in the Public Concession and the French Concession limited rice sales to one yuan. A few rice shops even publicly announced "rice stock sold out, temporarily closed." Rice shops such as Yuchengtai on Fujian Road and Wanchang on Baxianqiao, to maintain the food supply for ordinary people, sold as much as possible, resulting in crowded conditions for rice buyers. Temporary police were dispatched to maintain order. As for the flour market, retail prices have risen to four yuan and two jiao per bag. However, according to reporters' inquiries with the rice industry, although rice stocks in Shanghai are low, wheat and flour stocks are sufficient, and flour factories such as Fuxin have started production. At the same time, the concession authorities have ordered a large batch of foreign rice from outside factories to be transported to Shanghai. Therefore, the food supply in Shanghai will definitely not face a shortage panic. According to the North-China Daily News, the Municipal Council received news from responsible parties that it had ordered foreign rice last week, sufficient for three to four weeks, which is now being loaded onto ships and transported. In the near future, it can be supplied to the residents of Shanghai. Currently, Shanghai's rice stocks are sufficient for three weeks, so there is no other concern about the food supply in this port.

Strictly Prohibit Deliberately Raising Prices

The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, in view of the fact that food, fuel, and vegetables are daily necessities for the people, in addition to ordering various rice industry groups and the Fuel and Vegetable Management Committee to take measures to transport and regulate them in Shanghai, strictly prohibits various sellers from deliberately raising prices. Those who violate this and are verified to be true will be severely investigated.

Preparing Supplies and Purchasing Rice

The Shanghai Branch of the Emergency Period Refugee Relief Committee held its fifth executive committee meeting at 3:00 PM on the 10th of this month. The chairman was Pan Gongzhan, and the recorder was Lei Kenan. There were a total of nine reporting items, omitted. Discussion items: ① The repatriation group drafted a list of repair costs for ships damaged on duty and compensation for distressed boatmen, which was handed over to Kui Yanfang, Zhang Binghui, and Zhou Xuexiang for review. ② The fuel for each refugee camp will be temporarily purchased by the reception group. ③ Request the municipal government to issue a purchase certificate to explore and purchase 100,000 shi of rice from various places, omitted.

### The Poor Find it Difficult to Buy Rice

Recently, various rice shops in the concessions, due to the interruption of supply, sell their limited stock in small quantities. The rice was sold out the day before yesterday. Yesterday, those with empty stocks could not cope with customers and closed their doors, declaring that there was no goods, causing poor people who had no overnight food to buy rice for cooking, wandering in the streets, feeling very difficult.

### Battlefield Ambulance Team Moves to Nanshi

Since its establishment on August 13th, the Chinese Battlefield Ambulance Team has rescued no less than a thousand wounded soldiers. After the fall of Dachang, in addition to a part going to the inland to work, the rest moved to Nanshi. The General Office of Military Ambulance also moved into Nanshi the day before yesterday to defend the land with our army. The armbands and symbols issued by the team, bearing the seal of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, have been lost in large numbers recently. In addition to reporting them as invalid, staff cards will be used from today onwards.

### Fierce Fighting in Southern Shanghai, Stray Bullets Flying

Enemy Bullets Fly into the French Concession, Killing Twelve Men and Women

As the war moved to southern Shanghai, enemy artillery shells flew into the Xujiahui Road area of the French Concession during fierce fighting in the Huigang area yesterday, causing many casualties. The injured were sent to the Deci and Renji hospitals by the French police for treatment. Those who were killed by shrapnel on the spot included Mrs. Zhang (35 years old, Ningbo native) who died on the first floor of No. 67, Hengqing Lane, Beile Road; an unknown man, about 40 years old, who died at the entrance of No. 21, Tongfu Lane, Xujiahui Road; an unknown boy and girl who died in Hengqing Lane, Beile Road; You Gengnian, a man in his thirties, who died at the back door of No. 677, Malang Road; and Wang Adong (34 years old, Huangyan native) who died in front of No. 19, Anlin Lane, Xujiahui Road. Also, in the afternoon, two women and two girls were killed by stray bullets on Xiaodongmen Street. The bodies were sent to the coroner's office to await reporting to the court for examination.

Also, Hua Hongyuan, a detective of the Political Department of the French Concession, No. 356, 30 years old, from Jiangbei, was assigned to perform his duties in the refugee area of Niecheng yesterday to protect refugees. At 2:45 PM, he and two colleagues went to the Changxing Restaurant at No. 36, Minhang Road, outside Xiaodongmen, French Concession, for lunch. Just as the enemy was attacking Nanshi, the left temple of detective Hua was hit by a flying artillery shell, and Wang Xiangdao, an apprentice at the restaurant, was injured in the leg. Both were rushed to the Guangci Hospital by the police. Hua died in the hospital due to serious injuries. The body was transferred to the Talas Road coroner's office to await a report to the court for examination. It is reported that the political minister of the French Concession, Salih, mourned the detective's death in the line of duty and heard that detective Hua was destitute, leaving behind young children and a weak wife. The French Concession decided to give preferential treatment to his family.

### Rice Merchants in the Northeast Areas Take Note

All rice merchants with rice stocks in Hongkou and Yangshupu, regardless of the quantity, please go to the Food Transportation Office, Room 602, Municipal Council, on the morning of the 13th of this month (Saturday) to discuss matters. Do not miss it.

### American Red Cross's Righteous Act Donates Ten Million to Rescue Refugees

According to the Continental Newspaper, according to a telegram from the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Wang Zhengting, the American Red Cross is now discussing raising 10 million US dollars to relieve the people of China who have suffered from the war. All preparations have been completed. The detailed measures for the fundraising campaign are not yet known here, but it is said that it will be carried out according to the American Red Cross's fundraising and relief methods after the Tokyo earthquake. The American Red Cross has recently remitted funds to China to relieve refugees and provide hospital medical expenses. Yesterday, an official of the Chinese Red Cross stated that the scope of the war is expanding, so there is an urgent need for funds and medicines. The news of the American Red Cross's continued assistance is appreciated. At the same time, medicines weighing more than 100 tons, transported by two American warships and one merchant ship, will arrive in China soon, some of which were donated by the American Red Cross, and will be distributed to various war zones for application after arrival.

### Charity Organizations Exert Themselves to Rescue Refugees in Western Shanghai and Pudong

More Than Four Thousand Refugees Rescued in Western Shanghai, Two Difficulties in Crossing Refugees Sent to Safe Zone

After our army defended the new position, the residents of the western Shanghai area and the Tushanwan area of Xujiahui lost their support and moved to safe zones. Except for a part of the young and strong, who have all escaped to the border between China and the concessions, and were distributed by various charities to the refugee camps for resettlement, there are still a large number of women and children waiting for rescue. When the charity organizations heard the news, they sent a large number of trucks and ambulances to rescue at the risk. As of noon yesterday, more than 4,000 refugees have been rescued. In the afternoon, they continued to rescue, but they felt that there was a shortage of vehicles and many refugees. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will lend or donate them.

The World Red Swastika Society rescue team has been rescuing refugees crossing the river on the Bund for the past few days. The current team has transported more than 1,800 refugees out of the Bund area and sent them to safe zones. They also negotiated with the French Concession Authority at the junction of Fahua and obtained the assistance of the French Public Works Bureau, opening the iron gate for one hour. More than 10,000 refugees escaped, crowded and shouting, in a very tragic state. There are still refugees who have not been able to escape, hungry and cold, gathered around the iron gate, unable to move forward or backward, with a tendency to sit and wait for death. The team transported more than 10,000 steamed buns and scattered them to provide relief.

### Recent News from the International Committee of the Red Cross

Since its establishment, the Shanghai International Committee of the Chinese Red Cross has been working very hard. In addition to planning and setting up refugee camps in Nanshi, it has also been widely soliciting donations at home and abroad to cover relief expenses. From the 1st to the 10th of this month, the donors included the American Asia Insurance Company, various departments, donating a total of 3,000 yuan, the Fujian Christian Federation, 1,558 yuan and 52 cents, the Yiyuan Dog Racing Track, 1,211 yuan and 52 cents, the Netherlands Hong Kong Company, 1,000 yuan, the Huifu Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in Mozhi Province, 974 yuan and 74 cents, Mr. Anonymous, 900 yuan, Mr. Xue Kelun, 100 yuan, Mr. Bian Nad, 50 yuan, and Mr. Tian Bolie, 25 yuan. Together with the previous donations, the total is 1,076,264 yuan and 9 jiao. According to the inspection report of the health group of the association, some refugees in the refugee camps in the city have beriberi, scabies, smallpox and other diseases due to unsuitable food and malnutrition. In addition to notifying the various organizers to strive for improvement to maintain health, the association's reporting committee also discussed the issue of organizing a general refugee hospital on the 9th of this month. Because of the financial constraints, it is still hoped that caring people from all walks of life will contribute generously. If there are donations, they can be sent to the office of the general manager of the association at No. 505, Henan Road. The association believes that the war has a tendency to spread, and the scope of relief will also expand accordingly. It is necessary to prepare in advance, and a sub-committee office has been established, and Rev.R.D.Rees is appointed as the director, Shi Siming, Cai Zengji, and Baker are appointed as members, to strive for progress. The wounded soldier hospital run by the New Drug Industry Institute has been listed as the fifth wounded soldier hospital by the association for coordination. According to Mr. Yan Fuqing, director of the association's wounded soldier committee, all 24 wounded soldier hospitals in Shanghai lack medical supplies and hope that all sectors will generously donate.

### Great Fires in Nanshi and Pudong

After the enemy landed in Pudong, they deployed many heavy artillery pieces in various places, and three heavy artillery pieces were also set up near the Jinyi Road and Xie Shi Road in western Shanghai. A heavy artillery piece was set up on the southeast corner building of the Zhongshan Hospital in Fenglinqiao. Yesterday, the combined firepower bombarded our Nanshi area all day long. At the same time, more than 20 enemy planes also went to bomb indiscriminately yesterday. Therefore, the intensity of the bombing in Nanshi yesterday and the amount of donations and destruction were unprecedented. Dozens of fires broke out in various places that were hit. For a time, the flames soared into the sky, and the fire was shining on the sky. When the reporter sent the manuscript, it was still burning.

Since the enemy troops landed in Pudong, they have been setting fires and burning them everywhere. For a time, the smoke and smoke rose into the sky in the Chunjiang Wharf and Lan Nidu areas, covering the sky and the sun. The situation was fierce and unprecedented. At the same time, a large number of enemy planes threw a large number of incendiary bombs over Nanshi, west from Rihui Port, east to the 16th Pu, Dongjiadu, and the South Railway Station. Therefore, local houses also caught fire and extended immediately, causing smoke to fill the air, echoing the great fire in Pudong, extending for several miles. The houses, factories, and cultural and commercial institutions in Nanshi and Pudong were mostly destroyed. In addition, it is reported that some refugees in Nanshi failed to evacuate and were mostly killed and died. The sad and miserable situation could not be worse.

### Thoroughly Implement the Prime Minister's Anti-War Proposition

— Tong Xingbai

The great Prime Minister was born in China, which has suffered many disasters. Today marks the seventy-second anniversary of his birth. Because of the birth of him alone, the history of the revival of the Chinese nation has been divided into several great eras, creating many glorious deeds, making an old and declining China move from conservatism to reform; from decadence to vigor; from feudalism to revolution; from a dark and chaotic society to a country with endless hope. Although he has passed away for twelve years today, his great spiritual legacy still dominates the minds of the entire nation; controls the actions of the entire nation; striving and inheriting in every possible way, until today—the day of the war of resistance.

When China was advancing on the path of revolutionary construction shown by the Prime Minister, it suddenly encountered the enemy—the aggression and sniping of Japanese imperialism. The people of the country were angry and unanimously advocated resistance. If we try to explore its roots from the process of historical evolution and the influence of ideological development, we can know that it is a necessary result of being summoned and inspired by the Prime Minister's political thought. Otherwise, since the Opium War, China has experienced many aggressions, why have we never heard of the people's advocacy of resistance as universal and fierce as today? This is the effect of the accumulation of revolutionary history, the result of the development of the Prime Minister's thought, and the symbol of the new China marching towards the road of revival.

Why do we say that our advocacy of resistance today is a resonance caused by the Prime Minister's revolutionary thought? We can get this without waiting for imagination, as long as we open the revolutionary history of China in the past 20 years, we can understand clearly. After the Guangzhou Shaji Massacre, China only suffered some insults, but the Prime Minister personally presided over the famous Hong Kong strike movement to deal with it. When Chen Jiongming rebelled in Guangzhou, although the Prime Minister avoided boarding the Yongfeng warship, he still sent troops to quell the rebellion and insisted to the end. As for nationalism, it is even more thoroughly explained, saying that China is a sub-colony and China should seek its own liberation. We should help weak nations and resist aggressive nations; how kind and clear it is! Today, since the enemy wants to destroy our country and exterminate our race, the people of the country naturally unconsciously sing out the proposition of resistance to maintain the survival of our country and nation. Even if we lose troops and land, and our families are destroyed, the people of the country never regret it, nor do they complain, but clench their teeth and endure it. We only hope that one day we can avenge this great revenge! Snow this great shame! Is this kind of perseverance and great spirit accidental? This is the great symbol of the revolutionary people who have received the Prime Minister's spiritual legacy! Today is the Prime Minister's birthday again! Especially when the enemy cavalry is pressing down on the border, we meet the Prime Minister's birthday! Revolutionary people! What kind of method shall we use to commemorate our great Prime Minister? We can only deal with the current enemies of our nation by understanding the Prime Minister's spirit and will of "struggling when oppressed and resisting when invaded." Although we are in the besieged city today, "the three armies can be deprived of their commander, but a common man cannot be deprived of his will"! We swear to fight to the end with an unyielding spirit to thoroughly implement the Prime Minister's consistent anti-war proposition. At the same time, it is also the best way to commemorate the Prime Minister in the most meaningful and valuable way.

### Letter to Citizens on the Prime Minister's Birthday

Shanghai All Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association

Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Prime Minister of the Chinese Kuomintang, with his prescience and indomitable spirit, has been constantly fighting for the national revolution for forty years. Its purpose is to seek the liberation of the nation, the extension of civil rights, and the equal satisfaction of people's livelihood. The final hope is to advance mankind to equality and mutual assistance and lay the foundation for peace and happiness in the world. Such a great proposition is not only adapted to the laws of historical evolution, but also the ultimate in socialism.

In the past, although there were many naive patients with insufficient understanding who misinterpreted or doubted the revolutionary Three People's Principles, some were bound by feudal consciousness and had weak faith in the doctrine. However, the development of facts has proved that the Three People's Principles are absolutely necessary and absolutely correct. Now, the trend of international pacifism and the trend of the revolutionary thoughts in the country are all included in the Prime Minister's doctrines and policies. If we had been able to have consistent faith and thoroughly implement it earlier, China would have been able to quickly embark on the road of freedom and equality, and would never have created such a serious situation as it is now.

This year's Prime Minister's birthday commemoration is held in the enemy's artillery fire that envelops the entire China. The glory of the Three People's Principles is shining deep into the hearts of 450 million people. The angry tide of national revolution has made the world history unfold a new page. Looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, we have to put forward four important contributions:

㊀ Firm Common Belief: Doctrine is a rational thought, but this thought is by no means created out of thin air. It is the highest principle to guide the revolution that is inevitably produced due to the contradiction and conflict of social relations. Faith in doctrine is by no means blind obedience or utilization, but because we have to solve the realistic national problems, political problems, and economic problems, and have to produce common requirements and collective forces. Since we believe that the Three People's Principles are the revolutionary principles that reflect the objective environment and subjective life of China, then the collective force produced by this should make it more substantial and able to achieve the ultimate goal of the Three People's Principles.

㊁ Consolidate the United Front: Although China has encountered unprecedented suffering in history, it has also achieved unprecedented unity. The establishment of the national united front is certainly due to the brutal aggression of Japanese imperialism, and it is also the result of the arduous struggle of the supreme leaders, government authorities, and revolutionary elements across the country over the years. This epoch-making glorious unity is not only the only cornerstone for sweeping away the Japanese army and recovering the lost land, but also the main factor in forming a modern country. We can only stand on the bright cornerstone that has already been successful, with one heart and one mind, and move forward to complete the revolutionary tasks left to us by the Prime Minister.

㊂ Strive to Fight to the End: The Prime Minister clearly pointed out in nationalism that "we should help weak nations and resist aggressive nations." From this, it can be seen that resistance to Japan is the Prime Minister's proposition. China is now at the final juncture where there is an enemy but no me, and there is me but no enemy. Since the war of resistance has been launched, all men, women, old and young across the country can only do their best and sacrifice for the country, and must not hope to live in peace and start diligently and end lazily. It must be known that compromise is a dead end, and only fighting to the end is a way out. The gains and losses of one place and the advance and retreat of one strategy are inevitable phenomena in the process of resistance and have no shadow on the overall situation and final victory. Since the central government has made up its mind to break the cauldron and sink the boat, we should also insist on the will of rather dying than surrendering, and use organization and action to destroy the enemy's conspiracies and fantasies.

㊃ Comfort the Soldiers at the Front: Our army's heroic battles over the past three months have given the enemy a serious blow, and have also won supreme honor in the international community. China's international status is increasing day by day, and the number of friends who sympathize with China is increasing day by day. Needless to say, it is the price of blood and flesh paid by the soldiers at the front. Although we live in the rear, our hearts are always on every soldier who defends the country. When it is raining heavily, they are still wearing soaking clothes, standing in trenches with knee-deep water, resolutely killing the enemy. This kind of arduous and outstanding spirit is not possessed by soldiers of any country. Therefore, on the Prime Minister's birthday, we specially hold a rain coat fundraising campaign, hoping that people from all walks of life will raise more money to reduce the suffering of the soldiers at the front and increase their combat effectiveness.

The Prime Minister was born for revolution and died for revolution. Today, on the Prime Minister's birthday, I only feel that his legacy is inspiring us, and his spirit is encouraging us. We can only commemorate the Prime Minister in the practical work of resisting the enemy and saving the country, which is meaningful.

### The City Celebrates the Prime Minister's Birthday by Hanging Flags Today

The City Party Headquarters Raises Raincoats to Comfort the Soldiers

Today is the anniversary of the birth of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the late Prime Minister of the Kuomintang. In order to commemorate the great spirit of the Prime Minister, the City Party Headquarters specially notified all groups and individuals to hold celebration ceremonies. The whole city will also hang flags for one day to celebrate. At the same time, in order to comfort the soldiers at the front during the war of resistance, it has launched a campaign to raise 50,000 raincoats, which will be sent to the front by members of the department today and distributed to various combat troops for application.

The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce issued a public announcement yesterday that today is the Prime Minister's birthday commemoration, and all shops in the city should hang flags to celebrate. The Public Concession Municipal Council is also closed for one day to show its celebration.

### The National Salvation Donation Committee Sorts Out Receipts

The Shanghai National Salvation Donation Raising Committee, in order to raise gold and silver articles to be transferred to the National Salvation Donation, originally designated the Bingzi Society, Tongyi Middle School, Laofengxiang, Kui Cheng, Fang Jiuxia, and silver shops to collect them. Now, in order to sort out the receipts for these gold and silver articles, so that donors can exchange them for national salvation public bonds in the future, special measures have been formulated. The summary is as follows: ① The gold and silver articles mentioned refer to gold and silver and their products, silver standard coins, and silver shop coins and foreign currencies. ② For the receipts issued by the two collection points designated by the association and the three silver shops, donors are requested to bring them to the following locations and times to exchange them for formal national salvation donation receipts. ③ For the national salvation donation receipts issued by Xingzhuang newspaper and magazine, and those that contain gold and silver articles, donors are requested to bring them to supplement the number of national currencies worth the articles. ④ For the gold and silver articles collected by the newspapers and magazines, the receipts prepared by the newspapers and magazines themselves, rather than the national salvation donation receipts of the association, because the newspapers and magazines will guarantee that the articles will be valued by themselves and the funds will be remitted to the association, the weight, fineness, etc. of the gold and silver articles donated by each household cannot be verified, so the national salvation donation receipts stating the number of national currencies cannot be exchanged for each household. ⑤ All gold and silver articles that the Central Bank does not accept or redeem, or their accessories (such as platinum jewelry, gold watches, silver watches, fountain pens, diamond rings, gems, silver plated gifts, etc.) will be disposed of separately and used for consolation, etc. The original receipt will not be exchanged for the national salvation donation receipt. ⑥ The place for exchanging receipts and supplementing the value is Xu Yongzuo Accounting Shuai's office at No. 123 Aiduya Road, Shanghai. The time is from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day (except holidays), from now until November 30th of this year. Those who fail to exchange or supplement the record after the deadline will be regarded as waiving their rights, and the silver dollars obtained from the sale will be directly paid to the national treasury.

### Shuai Shufen and Hu Laiji Public Service

Our museum received 2,000 yuan in national currency from Mr. Shuai Shufen yesterday, instructing us to forward it to the Shanghai Relief Committee to relieve refugees. Hu Laiji also donated 400 yuan in national currency, 200 yuan each, to be allocated to rescue wounded soldiers and relieve refugees. People like Mr. Shuai and Hu are truly admirable for their enthusiasm.

### The Small Vegetable Market Still Lacks Products

Meat Prices Slightly Fall, Vegetable Prices Remain Firm

Since the prices of food in Nanshi have been showing a slight upward trend, it is a temporary excitement phenomenon. Therefore, yesterday's pork price has slightly recovered. One yuan in national currency can buy one jin and two taels of meat. The day before yesterday, only one jin and seven taels could be bought. However, the vegetable price is still showing an upward trend. It is a little difficult to pick into the concession, and the supply is slightly lacking. The rarity of goods is also an inevitable result. It was found that the price of cabbage yesterday was 6 cents per jin. Other market prices such as celery, bean sprouts, and water chestnuts also increased considerably. Compared with weekdays, they have increased by three or four tenths. According to the reporter of Datong News Agency, he went to various small vegetable markets for inspection yesterday morning. In general, the quantity of various foods seemed to be less than usual, so stall vendors closed the market early, causing customers who entered the market a little late to return with empty baskets. However, this situation is purely a temporary phenomenon and I believe that normalcy can be restored within days.

### Apprehension of Kidnappers Solves Schoolboy Abduction Case

Lawyer Yuan Shuaidan, a native of Xiangtan, Hunan, residing at 979 Foch Road, reported that his eldest son, Shaozeng, 13 years old, was on his way to Xie Jin Elementary School at 150 Jing'an Temple Road at 7:55 AM on the 8th of this month when he was suddenly kidnapped by several thugs at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hardoon Road. They forced him into a parked car, license number 1780, and sped away. Yuan reported the incident to the police, requesting their investigation. Yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM, Yuan Shuaidan received a letter from the kidnappers, requesting that someone be sent at 4:00 PM, carrying a document and a box by rickshaw to near Connaught Road and Xiaoshadu Road. They stipulated that no more than two people should come. The report was made to the police station, and detectives Tang Jian and Tang Shihong rushed to the area to keep watch. Detective Qiao, disguised as Yuan's representative, went as scheduled. Subsequently, a man from Tongzhou, Pan Aru, repeatedly circled the area on a bicycle, paying close attention to Detective Qiao's movements. Undercover detectives arrested him and brought him back to the police station. During interrogation, Pan confessed that he was indeed sent by the kidnappers and that the hostage was being held in a pavilion room at 263, Lane 638, Zhongxin Gate Road. The detectives rushed to surround the building. Detectives Tang and Tang personally led the charge, and found the hostage, Yuan Shaozeng, inside. The guard, Yan Baogen, from Shanghai (also known as Chen Maohan and Chen Liansheng), attempted to escape by jumping out of the window and over the roof. Detective Tang fired a shot, hitting him in the thigh, and he was captured. Subsequently, Detective Tang also discovered a car, number 8461, on Tongfu Road, which was used in the kidnapping. However, the license plate number did not match, which was suspicious. It was discovered that the car belonged to Xu Maxiang (also known as Xu Afu) from Tongzhou. Xu was arrested at 1730 Kangjia Bridge, and two fake documents with the number 1780 were seized, revealing the truth of the matter. Xu also confessed to being the mastermind of the case. This morning, the two suspects, Pan and Xu, were sent to the First Special Court. Lawyers Wang Yaotang, Qian Xunjiu, and Chen Ming reported the details to the court. Because the suspect Yan was injured and in the hospital, he could not be brought to court. A request was made for a postponement of his hearing. Judge Dai Rongyi questioned them and ordered them to be detained and the hearing postponed.

### Commemorating Premier Sun's Birthday and Comforting Wounded Soldiers and Refugees

Today is the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth. The Service Department of the Shanghai Occupational Circles Salvation Association, to commemorate the great spirit of the Premier, sent representatives with a large number of daily necessities to various shelters to comfort the refugees. At the same time, they accompanied refugee representatives, including young children, to various military hospitals to comfort wounded soldiers, in order to promote the Premier's great spirit.

### Occupational Circles Continue to Solicit Cotton Clothing and Quilts for Refugees

Regardless of New or Old, No Matter How Much - Ha Ning Foreign Firm Donates Raincoats

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, refugees from various places have fled to seek refuge. There are more than a hundred shelters in Shanghai, housing more than one hundred thousand refugees, all of whom fled the war zone in thin clothing. The weather is gradually getting colder, and hundreds of thousands of refugees lack cotton clothing and quilts, making starvation and exposure a concern. In view of this, the Shanghai Occupational Circles Salvation Association has been soliciting donations since March. It has received generous donations of clothing and quilts from all walks of life, but there are not enough to go around. Therefore, it is specially requested again that kind-hearted gentlemen from all walks of life generously donate, regardless of new or old, large or small, no matter how much. Saving refugees is a great merit. Please notify the association by phone or letter, and they will send someone to collect the donations. The association's telephone number is 96597.

All employees of the Ha Ning Foreign Firm at 146 Bund, Fourth Road, donated 62.40 yuan the other day and purchased 39 raincoats. The money has been donated to the Municipal Executive Committee. The enthusiastic donation of the firm is commendable.

### All Circles Continue to Donate Comfort Items

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation Committee for Comforting the Anti-Japanese Soldiers continued to receive donations of comfort items from all circles yesterday. These included 1,000 pairs of straw sandals from the Yarn Exchange Brokers Association, 50,000 packs of Men's brand cigarettes from the Fuxin Tobacco Company, 100 first-aid kits from the Hengfu Silver Store, 10 dozens of towels from the Yaohua Medicine Factory, one bicycle from Sun Weixian, 50 pairs of rubber shoes from Huang Longtai Wang Kaichuan, 19 raincoats from the Room Department of the Huamei Apartment, 1,000 first-aid kits collected by Ding Huikang and Zhu Wenjie of the Wan Tai Foreign Firm, and 180 cotton vests from Ding Jinsheng and 25 others.

### Foreign Nationals Celebrate Peace Memorial Day

Yesterday was the European Peace Memorial Day, also known as Thanksgiving Day. The consuls and military personnel of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, Germany, and other countries stationed in Shanghai held a celebration in front of the Goddess of Peace on the Bund in the French Concession at 9:00 AM, laying wreaths. Warships of various countries stationed in the Huangpu River and consulates and public institutions of various countries stationed in Shanghai all flew flags in celebration. Various foreign charities sent young women to sell red paper flowers on the streets to commemorate the day and use the donations to comfort disabled veterans and for charitable causes. The image on the left is an overview of the Goddess of Peace, courtesy of the International Society.

### Banking Industry Permitted by Ministry Order to Withdraw Cash for Cotton Purchases

Must Follow Application Procedures

The Shanghai Banking Industry Association received Instruction No. 88 from the Ministry of Finance, stating that: "According to the Shanghai Cotton Ginning Industry Association's request for permission to file and a request for the Shanghai banking industry to allow the withdrawal of banknotes for cotton purchases to alleviate the plight of farmers, this year's weather has been favorable since summer, and the cotton harvest in the cotton-growing areas is not bad. However, due to the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai, farmers in the Pudong area, fearing the rampant bombing by Japanese invaders, and due to the inconvenience of land and water transportation, the cotton harvest has been difficult to transport and sell. If measures are not taken to transport and sell the cotton as soon as possible, the impact on the rural economy will be significant. The members of this association are deeply concerned about this, and fortunately, the Pudong Native Place Association shares the same view. Therefore, the association invited cotton ginning industry colleagues to form the Pudong Cotton Transportation and Sales Association to send personnel to various villages to purchase cotton and clear the backlog. However, farmers are accustomed to receiving banknotes for their cotton sales, and the members of this industry are deeply afraid that the money deposited in the banking industry cannot be withdrawn as banknotes at this time of urgent need to purchase cotton, which is of great concern to the future of the industry and the livelihood of farmers who depend on this for a living.

### Official Discusses Defending Nanshi to Retreating

Still Two Lone Army Routes Making Last Struggle - Qingpu and Songjiang Still in Our Hands, No Change in Nanxiang

(Reported by this newspaper) After our army strategically abandoned various positions in Pudong and West Shanghai, one brigade of the 55th Division and the entire Shanghai South Police Brigade were ordered to defend Nanshi in order to show the defense of the last piece of Chinese territory in Shanghai and extract a corresponding price from the enemy. After the enemy invaded the Xujiahui Longhua area on the morning of the 9th, they began to surround and approach Nanshi. Our army, led by Brigade Commander Zhang Bin and Police Chief Cai Jingjun, led all loyal military police officers and soldiers to defend to the death. From the 9th to last night, they fought fiercely for three days and nights, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. It was not until about 9:00 PM last night that Zhang and Cai received an order from the supreme leader to retreat. Only then did our loyal soldiers retreat with tears in their eyes. By about 1:00 AM this morning, they had all withdrawn in an orderly manner. However, in the Nanshi Wharf Dongjiadu area, there were still about 300 police brigade members who had not received the order last night. This morning, they were still fighting bravely in the area, preparing to make a heroic sacrifice. This reporter interviewed a senior official in charge of the command this afternoon, who recounted the details of the bitter battle. According to him, after receiving the order to defend Nanshi, we immediately mobilized all the military police, allocated defense responsibilities, and prepared to deal with the enemy. The position from Rihui Port next to Xujiahui Road to the Huangpu River, and then eastward along the river to the Inland Waterworks Company was defended by the 55th Division, with a total force of six battalions. The position from the Inland Waterworks Company along the river to Dada Wharf (East end of Fangbang Road) was defended by the Police Brigade, with a total of about 3,000 policemen. From the evening of the 9th, enemy troops and enemy warships from the Fenglin Bridge area and the Huangpu River began to attack our defense line, resulting in skirmishes. Repeated attacks were repelled by our army. From the morning of the 10th, the battle gradually intensified. Our army fought bravely to meet the enemy and prevent them from advancing. The position was also very stable. However, from 6:00 AM on the 11th, the enemy mobilized a large number of artillery and aircraft to launch a general attack on us. In the fierce battle until noon, most of our Rihui Port east bank and riverside fortifications were destroyed. At 1:30 PM, the enemy used smoke screens on the Pingyin Bridge side of Rihui Port and forced their way across the river at 2:00 PM. At the same time, four enemy tanks also crossed the river. At that time, due to the enemy's artillery bombardment and the increasing ferocity of the attack, our formation disintegrated and fell into chaos. They had to retreat to the Jumen Road. At about 4:00 PM, the enemy tanks advanced and forced our troops. The situation was very critical. They immediately dispatched the Police Brigade along the river to rush to support and hold the line of Lujiabang, uniting with the National Army in the Jumen Road Manufacturing Bureau Road area, advancing step by step and resisting section by section. In the fierce battle until about 6:00 PM in the evening, the Manufacturing Bureau area was broken through by the enemy's center. Our army was forced to retreat to the left and right at the same time, and then dispatched a large team of police from the Dada Wharf to concentrate on the small east gate Dongmen Road, Dananmen, Xieqiao, Huining Hall, and other strongholds to fight the enemy to the death until about 9:00 PM in the evening. Then they received the order to retreat. Then we ordered to start retreating to the small east gate and Nanyang Bridge. By about 1:00 AM this morning, the retreat was completed. However, there were still about three to four hundred policemen in the southern Huangpu area who failed to retreat and were surrounded by the enemy. They are still fighting hard in the area, and are currently trying to convey the order, ordering them to withdraw as appropriate. In short, this time our army was ordered to defend Nanshi, and fought fiercely for three days and nights, but failed to succeed. It can not be said they have made a heroic sacrifice. As a defeated general, it is a shame to the people of the country. He also said that during the fiercest battle, tens of thousands of refugees were in the combat area, and I do not know how many died in the chaos, the tragic situation is painful, he sighed.

### Besieged, Calmly Resisting

According to the Central News Agency, Zhang's brigade and the police headquarters, which defended the last position in Nanshi, fought hard under enemy artillery fire and rain of bullets. The fortifications were destroyed, and they were cut off from water and food. Therefore, they received an order to retreat yesterday afternoon. Most of them had retreated late at night. However, there was still a part of the unit guarding the city warehouse and Ning Shao Inn along the outer Ma Road south of the Guan Bridge. Because they did not receive the order, they were still calmly resisting in the encirclement of the enemy, vowing to use the last drop of blood to protect their country and defend their land. The enemy's artillery bombardment did not stop all night, but their infantry did not rush in. This morning, several enemy rubber boats sailed near the area from the Huangpu River, but were shot away by our machine guns. At noon, our army was still calmly holding on. After Nanshi fell into the hands of the enemy, they set fire to it. By noon, there were still three places of black smoke rising up, burning. (Central News Agency)

### Unyielding Loyalty and Admirable Courage

According to the Central News Agency, south of Lujiabang Road in Nanshi, east of the railway station, and near Bansongyuan on the riverside, there was another part of our garrison, about several hundred people, who continued to fight hard against the enemy because they had not received the order. At the moment, our army in the area has been heavily surrounded by the enemy on three sides since last night. In addition to using heavy artillery to bombard fiercely, the enemy also used armored vehicles to protect them, and charged our garrison several times. However, because the garrison was determined to coexist with the position, they were determined to extract a corresponding price from the enemy. Therefore, they occupied the high-rise buildings and densely fired machine guns at the enemy. Even if there was only one bullet and one soldier left, they would fight to the death. Therefore, as of noon, the two sides were still fighting fiercely.

### Enemy Artillery Shells Nanshi All Night from Pudong

After 6:00 PM last night, they launched artillery bombardments towards Nanshi all night, destroying many warehouses and houses south of the 16th Pier. This reporter took a small ferry of a certain foreign shipping company to Pudong Wharf at 8:00 AM this morning, and looked south from afar. South of the 16th Pier Huangpu River blockade line, the enemy was still intermittently shelling, and the Nan Huangpu was filled with smoke. There were three steel cannons at the entrance of Dongchang Road, and the sound of firing was very loud. The Uba warship anchored on the Huangpu River also frequently shelled Nanshi.

### Unprecedented Disaster in Nanshi

Houses Burned to the Ground, Almost a Scorched Earth - Concession Connecting Water to Prevent Spreading to Refugees

Since yesterday, the Nanshi area, west of Xieqiao, has been almost completely scorched due to the indiscriminate throwing of incendiary bombs. The area east of Xieqiao Lujiabang to Haichao Temple was indiscriminately bombed by more than a dozen Japanese aircraft from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM yesterday, so the houses were not intact. The area near the Nanshi Railway Station was also half scorched. The Family Industry Association (i.e., the Invincible Tooth Powder Factory) west of the Local Court was destroyed, and the Disabled Institute in front of the Local Court was also destroyed. The houses in Huiren Lane on Huining Road behind the Local Court were completely destroyed. In the Liyuan Road area, many houses were destroyed, and even the annexes of the westward guild halls were affected. The houses between Lujiabang and Nanshi Railway Station are no longer intact. The buildings within Nanmatou, Dongjiadu, Damatou, Dadongmen, and Xian Gua Street have also been bombed quite a bit. Dozens of houses in Taiping Street in the city, on both sides of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association and Fuxingyuan Restaurant, caught fire. Fortunately, the fire was brought under control by the French Concession, so the fire only spread to the whole street of Taiping Street, and the fire did not spread to Dadongmen and Xiaonanmen, but many houses were still destroyed. The area was almost a pile of rubble. The wharves south of the cordon were completely burned, and the ships on the river, including rice ships, were completely destroyed and sunk. The fires at Manufacturing Bureau Road, Huining Road, Gaochang Road, Longhua Road in Nanshi, and Sanpailou in the city have not subsided and are still spreading fiercely. The black smoke in the sky is rising straight, winding and visible, and the scope of the fire is still spreading by noon.

### Father Rao Sincerely Comforts Refugees

Expresses Determination to Do His Best to Ensure Refugee Safety - Various Charities Are Trying to Rescue Them

Since the refugee area in Nanshi was realized, the various charities have accommodated a total of forty to fifty thousand refugees. However, the situation in Nanshi suddenly became tense, so there were occasional stray bullets in the area, causing great panic among the refugees. In addition, the French authorities issued a notice temporarily suspending traffic at the border, so the various relief organizations could not transport supplies. Father Rao, the initiator of the refugee area, in view of the dangerous situation of the refugees, disregarded everything and personally comforted the refugees at various refugee camps on the 11th. He did not return to the concession until late at night, and completed the negotiations with all parties on the supply of food. This morning, he escorted seven large trucks of bread and other food and tried to transport them to the area. According to Father Rao, he is determined to continue to maintain the safety of the refugee area, hoping that people from all walks of life will donate more supplies to prevent tens of thousands of refugees from starving to death.

The refugee areas in the city are full of refugees. It is hard to imagine. There are more than ten thousand of them. There are no less than twenty to thirty thousand homeless people along Minguo Road, all sleeping on the ground. At present, the refugee area not only has no rice, but also no flour, sweet potatoes, etc. Even if there is money, there is no place to buy them. Water and electricity have been cut off for two days, so tea houses and water boilers cannot open. The old, the weak, and the young are injured by squeezing through iron gates, and are dying of cold and starvation. There are also those who are injured by stray bullets, displaced and suffering, extremely tragic.

In the Nanshi area, there are still a small number of our troops resisting the enemy, so traffic at the border between the Chinese and French Concessions continues to be suspended. As a result, residents gathered on Minguo Road, Lao Beimen, Nanyang Bridge, and other areas have not slept for three days and three nights, and are all sleeping in the streets. Not only is the tap water cut off, but also the food supply has been cut off. This reporter went to inspect the iron gate at the border this morning and saw that the refugees were haggard and some were sitting on the ground crying silently, which was heartbreaking. Although various charities and philanthropists in the concession delivered sesame cakes and bread through the iron gate for relief, but there was not enough to go around and it was not enough to help. It is reported that various charities are making every effort to communicate with all parties in order to rescue the refugees from danger and maintain humanity.

According to the Dagong News Agency, tens of thousands of refugees gathered at the iron gates on the border between the Chinese and French Concessions on Minguo Road, enduring hunger and sleeping in the open air for two days without being able to eat. Therefore, some refugees have caught colds and illnesses, some have fallen to the ground due to hunger and cold, some have starved to death on the roadside, and some have cried loudly, the situation is tragic and heartbreaking. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will quickly take measures to help so that hundreds of thousands of compatriots can be reborn.

### (Brief Comments)

— 相

Brazil suddenly underwent a coup d'état, establishing a dictatorial regime. Various British observers commented on this, saying that the country has always tended towards democracy, and now it has changed its course. Its relationship is extremely important. I have said before that the prevalence of epidemics can only be eliminated by using strong disinfectants. If only isolation methods are used to avoid them, the epidemics will become more and more prevalent and spread further and further. The United Kingdom and the United States are deeply afraid of the spread of the fascist disease and are seeking ways to avoid it everywhere, without thinking of fundamentally eradicating it. Then the fascist disease will definitely spread everywhere and be all-pervasive. The sudden rise of the coup d'état in Brazil may be a major blow to Pan-Americanism.

In Shanghai, which has completely fallen into enemy hands, the significance of commemorating Sun Yat-sen's birthday is even deeper and more significant. After the report, everyone stood in silence for three minutes for the fallen soldiers of the country. Then, they shouted slogans and adjourned the meeting. Although the commemorative ceremony was short, the atmosphere at the venue was very solemn, tense, and dignified.

Also, all banks and money shops in the city will be closed today in commemoration of Sun Yat-sen's birthday to show their celebration. The Jianghai Customs will be closed today, and all customs clearance will be suspended. The Shanghai Postal Bureau, parcel and remittance departments, will also be closed all day. The other departments will handle business according to the Sunday office hours. The branches will also handle business according to the above time. The First Special District Local Court will also be closed for one day as usual. Yesterday, the court authorities notified the public concession police to stop releasing criminals for one day.

### Reconsidering the Method of Buying Bonds with Rent

The First Special Group Sends a Letter to the Real Estate Association

The First Special District Group of the National Salvation Public Bond Citizens' Fundraising Team sent a letter to the Real Estate Association yesterday, stating that the purchase of national salvation public bonds with rent is unanimously expected by all sectors. The association has previously resolved to notify landlords to use one month of September rent to buy public bonds, which shows enthusiasm and patriotism, and is deeply admired. However, because the market situation in Shanghai has been depressed in recent years, most tenants are in arrears with rent. It is difficult to exchange the bank bond receipts for September rent tickets before the arrears are cleared. At the same time, although the association has published notices in the newspaper to landlords, few landlords have announced it to tenants. As a result, most tenants are skeptical and fear that the landlord will refuse to accept them after buying public bonds with rent. As a result, the movement to buy public bonds with rent has been noisy for several months, but the effect is very fresh, which is a major regret for public bond fundraising. After discussion at the meeting of the team leaders of this group, all agreed that in this serious national crisis, it is the landlord's undeniable responsibility to contribute money to save the country. The Real Estate Association should reconsider as soon as possible, revoke the provision specifying September rent, and allow tenants who use one month's rent to buy public bonds for the landlord to exchange them for the most recent month's rent ticket. The landlord should also announce this method to the tenants in advance to facilitate promotion, etc., which is recorded in the records. In addition to suggesting it to the National Salvation Public Bond Fundraising Association, a corresponding letter is sent to your association for inspection and immediate reconsideration. Also, in order to understand the real estate situation in the First Special District, so as to advise the tenants, please provide the association with a copy of the membership list and a statement of the assets of the members for reference.

### Li Rensheng, Lost to All Moral Sense, Skims Rice and Grains Intended for Refugees

Li Rensheng, a Ningbo native and director of the Xinheng Shelter in the southern part of the Shenyuan Ball Field, skimmed off the food intended for refugees and privately filled his own pockets. After being informed on, he was arrested by Chinese Detective Zhang Mingde and detective Huang Fusheng of the General Patrol Room and taken to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. It has now been found that Li had 50担 of rice obtained from skimming hidden in the back room of the living room he rented at No. 3, Lane 196, Xiqiao弄, and then sold it. The police also learned that the food was sold to the Sanmao Rice Shop at No. 259, Shanhai Pass Road. When Li Rensheng went to peddle it, the shop owner was afraid that the origin was unclear and did not dare to buy it, but bought it after Li showed his card with the letterhead of a certain bookstore where he worked, claiming that the rice was purchased and stored by a friend before the war, and led the shop owner to a certain bookstore to prove that what he said was not false. As a result, it was purchased on the 27th of last month at a price of 669 yuan. The detectives went to search his workplace at No. 154, Yutuan Road, and found a leather bag belonging to Li, containing a sample of rice. They also went to search the pavilion room of his concubine at No. 15, Lane 290, Muer鳴 Road, but found nothing. As for where Li put the 669 yuan he obtained from selling the rice, he refused to reveal it, only admitting that the rice involved in the fraud was only more than ten担. The police summoned Li's introducer, Shen Binhan (director of the supply group of the Charity Organizations Relief Association) to the police station, briefly questioned him, and ordered him to leave. The case will be further investigated by the First Special Court in the near future. Last time, because the police investigation was not yet clear, they only requested the court to detain Li, and did not file a lawsuit. Now that the investigation has been completed, a formal indictment has been filed. The next trial will be conducted in accordance with the law for the crime he committed.

### A Corner of the Iron Gate at the Intersection of Laobeimen is Opened

Food is Transported to Distribute to Refugees to Alleviate Hunger

The Shanghai International Relief Association, because 60,000 to 70,000 refugees gathered in the area of Minguo Road in the south of the city have been without food for several days, the situation is very miserable, especially requested Father Rao to contact and dredge the French Concession authorities. As a result, they have agreed to open a corner of the iron gate at Laobeimen. Therefore, the association, together with various charitable organizations, is transporting supplies through this place to distribute to the refugees in the war zone to alleviate their hunger. Many citizens have volunteered to send tea, water, and food, which are being forwarded by the Boy Scouts.

### Various Food Organizations Strive to Maintain the People's Food Supply

Finding Ways to Dredge Sources and Adjust Prices

The New Voice News Agency reports that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in view of the current tense situation and transportation obstructions, considers it most important to regulate the people's food supply. It has ordered the four trade associations of bean and rice industry, rice shop industry, flour mill industry, and miscellaneous grain and oil cake industry to find ways to dredge sources and adjust prices. The above four associations have notified their member firms to do their best to maintain the people's food supply. Yuchengtail, Shunfeng, Wanchang, and other rice shops are selling as much as possible, but limiting each person to one yuan. The price of top-grade rice is 14 yuan per stone. Fuxin and other flour mills are rushing to produce flour to supply the market's needs. The retail price of flour this morning is between 4 yuan and 4.1 yuan per担. The concession authorities have found a way to transport the rice stored in the warehouses in the Hongkou district. As for the foreign rice ordered from abroad, it is heard that it has arrived in Shanghai. Therefore, there is no need to worry about Shanghai's food supply.

### The Hu Society is Planning the Food Supply Problem in Huzhou

It is Feared that There Will Be a Shortage Next Year; a Telegram is Sent to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to Coordinate Preparations

The Hu Society of this city believes that there should be sufficient preparations for the people's food supply in the rear during the war of resistance. Huzhou's rice production is not enough to be self-sufficient and relies on supplies from other ports. Although farmers have had a bumper harvest this year, due to the war, the money supply is extremely tight. Silver shops are making fewer loans, and the rice industry has not been able to store a large number. Farmers are also selling as much as possible because they need cash. It is feared that there will be a shortage next year, which is very important to the security of the rear. A telegram was sent to Zhejiang Provincial Government Chairman Zhu requesting him to coordinate preparations to maintain the people's food supply.

### The Unemployed Workers Assistance Association Solicits Skilled Workers

Unemployed Workers Who Have Registered Should Promptly Report Changes of Address by Letter

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Unemployed Workers Assistance Committee has registered five or six thousand qualified workers. Previously, in order to expand the scope of vocational introduction work, the association had separately sent letters to the provincial and municipal governments to introduce occupations to inland factories on their behalf, and sent letters to the provincial and municipal party departments and local newspapers to post free advertisements for publicity. Recently, the association has received telegrams from Nanjing and other inland factories one after another, requesting a large number of skilled workers, and has sent personnel to contact them. It is also heard that the skilled workers who enter the factory to work will be paid according to their technical level. It is now heard that the association still feels that the number of registered skilled workers is not enough to allocate. If there are unemployed workers in this city who have not registered, they must promptly go to the registration offices set up by the association to register, and must not miss the opportunity.

The area of Husi and Nanshi in this city has now fallen into the war zone. The Unemployed Workers Assistance Committee believes that the original communication addresses of the unemployed workers registered in the past have recently changed, especially strictly notified in various newspapers. Unemployed workers who have registered with the association and have changed their addresses must promptly send a letter to post office box 902, stating the registration number and the new address in the letter. The association will correct it accordingly.

### Guerrilla Warfare and Public Organization

— Nian Ci

First, I must state that I am neither a military scientist nor a literary figure. There are already many books on guerrilla warfare, with abundant materials, but their content is profound and not easily understood by the general public. Therefore, my purpose in writing this piece is solely to awaken the general public, to clarify their thinking, to thoroughly understand the advantages and disadvantages, and to prevent them from being exploited by the enemy again. Therefore, in terms of writing style, I aim for maximum accessibility.

In the past few years, the activities of our guerrilla forces have frequently been seen in newspapers; however, few people know about the organization and mission of these forces, or their living conditions. What good is merely knowing the term "guerrilla warfare"? Now that we know that China has such a formidable—great—special army that strikes fear into the enemy, we should further understand their organization, mission, and living conditions. The major task of the guerrillas is not only to prevent the enemy from having peace of mind, but also to deeply penetrate the population and closely connect with them—to organize the population. Therefore, our people cannot neglect to understand them. Now, let me outline their internal organization, mission, and history, as I know them, for the reference of our countrymen.

History of Guerrilla Warfare

The term guerrilla warfare seems to have been heard only in recent years; however, its history is quite long. In the past, Napoleon of France and Barclay of Russia both adopted this strategic approach. However, neither fully adopted it. Napoleon, when marching, advocated carrying few supplies, with all military supplies being requisitioned on the spot. But after encountering Barclay's "scorched earth" strategy, although the French army once occupied Moscow, they were unable to obtain food, causing temporary military unrest, and as a result, had to retreat immediately. The Russian army, upon learning of the French army's general retreat, immediately divided up to pursue them; at the same time, the French army fell into ambushes organized by local people everywhere and were already exhausted and demoralized from hunger, resulting in repeated defeats. By the time they retreated back to France, only over ten thousand soldiers remained out of an army of four hundred thousand! Napoleon's demise was hastened by this event.

Mr. Yang Jie, a renowned military scientist in our country, also mentioned "detachment tactics" in his discussion of strategy. This involves dispersing a group's forces to various locations to attack the enemy. This tactic probably refers to guerrilla warfare. Since the "September 18th" Incident, the volunteer armies in our Northeast have all adopted this tactic.

What is most hateful in our country now are the traitors, who are as numerous as feathers! If we do not intensify the training of the people, strengthen their will, and stabilize their lives, then this disorganized mass of people, due to their unstable lives, will take risks and easily be exploited by the enemy. Because there are so many traitors, preventing and eradicating them is particularly difficult. However, I believe that if our guerrilla forces can become widespread, the number of traitors may decrease. Because guerrilla forces organize the people everywhere, and once the people are organized and their understanding is clear, who would still want to be a traitor? Such a great guerrilla force, is it not worthy of our support and love?

Initially, our guerrillas used outdated weapons to resist the enemy. However, later, the enemy's artillery and machine guns gradually became their spoils of war. They are now almost exclusively using the enemy's guns to kill the enemy. How satisfying is that!

Organization of Guerrilla Forces

We must understand that the organization of guerrilla forces and regular armies differs due to different environments. Their numbers are also not fixed. They do not have airplanes or artillery, let alone armored vehicles and tanks. They only use a few types of light firearms such as: rifles, machine guns, wooden shell guns, automatic rifles...etc. They have separate command posts, enabling close communication between various units.

Tactics

㊀ Ambush and Assault: After discovering the enemy's marching plan, they pre-emptively ambush a considerable force at a strategic location. When the enemy passes by, they launch a sudden attack, catching the enemy off guard. Therefore, the timing and opportunity for guerrilla warfare are always when the enemy has just begun to move or has not yet established a firm foothold, using elusive tactics to launch surprise attacks.

㊁ Encirclement and Sniping: If they encounter a strong enemy, they immediately retreat, but not to escape, but to quickly detour via another route to attack the enemy's flank or rear, achieving the goal of gradual annihilation.

㊂ Avoiding Strength and Attacking Weakness: The number of guerrillas is not very large, so the most important thing is to preserve one's own strength, so they have to avoid strength and attack weakness. They must thoroughly scout out the enemy's troop strength, combat effectiveness, location of stockpiles of military supplies, and their communication and distance, before deciding on a method of attack. After driving away or eliminating the enemy, they take away what they need from the supplies, and then try to destroy the rest.

㊃ Feinting East, Attacking West: The most important thing for guerrillas to avoid is head-on combat, because their goal is to eliminate the enemy's main force. Once they encounter a strong enemy, they immediately divide their troops into skirmish lines, making the enemy hear gunfire from all directions and feel threatened from all sides, to intimidate the enemy.
