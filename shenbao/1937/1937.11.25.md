### Our Entire Front Line of Eastern Battlefield Positions Gradually Becoming Stabilized

Jiangyin Fortress Under Our Army's Firm Defense; Fierce Battles at Wuxing and Changxing on the Shores of Taihu Lake

According to news obtained from various sources yesterday by this newspaper, our army, starting from the Jiangyin Fortress on the south bank of the Yangtze River, passing through Wuxi, Wuxing, Yue Chongde, and reaching Zhapu Battery in Hangzhou Bay, spans a total of over 500 li. After several days of reorganization and replenishment by our highest military authorities, all units have established close communication, and the positions have gradually become stabilized. Although the Japanese army has been gathering substantial naval, land, and air forces in recent days, adopting strategies such as "central breakthrough" and "left and right flanking maneuvers," advancing simultaneously, attempting to seize all strongholds in one fell swoop in order to directly approach Nanjing, this plan has been clearly difficult to achieve due to obstruction by our various heavy troops. In the past two days, the center of gravity of the war situation seems to have shifted to the Beijing-Shanghai line and the south bank of Taihu Lake. This is because the Japanese army has fully realized that our river defenses in the Jiangyin area are solid, making a frontal attack difficult, and has therefore changed to a strategy of central breakthrough in order to achieve the effect of encirclement. In the past two days, although battles have been constantly evolving at the Duan Shan and Zhapu strongholds on the left and right flanks, they have only involved shelling and bombing, without major force engagement, so the situation is not very intense. However, from Fenghuang Mountain, north of the Xichang Highway, south to the line of Zhoujing Lane and Xin'anzhen on the Beijing-Shanghai Road, the Japanese army has been able to attack with heavy forces due to the convenient transportation in that area, and the fighting has been extremely fierce, with both sides suffering extremely heavy losses. As of the night before last, fierce battles were still raging on the arc-shaped line southeast of Wuxi. As for the Wuxing area on the south bank of Taihu Lake, bloody battles are still unfolding in the suburbs near the north, east, and south of the city. Although Japanese aircraft have continuously carried out large-scale bombings of key points on the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, it has not had a significant impact on our military. At the same time, the Japanese army has sent hundreds of marines to attack Jiapu Town through the Taihu Lake waterway, attempting to invade Changxing and put pressure on the rear of Wuxing. However, as that place is the center of the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway and the terrain is extremely important, our side has long been prepared, and a small number of marines will definitely not succeed. It is rumored that battles have occurred in the lake area east of Yixing, but this has not yet been verified. On the Tongxiang, Wangdian, and Zhapu line, our army has consistently defended its original positions. Also, it was widely rumored in Shanghai yesterday that Suzhou had not yet fallen, but after various investigations, it could not be verified due to traffic obstruction.

After our army abandoned Fushan, Langshan was indeed not lost. A large number of Japanese warships immediately advanced westward, gathering on the river surface east of the Jiangyin Fortress, actively attacking the Jiangyin Battery, attempting to break the blockade line. The artillery fire was extremely fierce, and aircraft assisted in the bombing. Our Jiangyin Battery also launched a fierce counterattack, and the defense was extremely tight, and the Japanese army ultimately failed. It is reported that the loyal and brave general ×××, who "defended Wusong to the death" in the 1932 Shanghai Incident, is the one who is holding the Jiangyin Fortress, and there is definitely no mistake. Heavy troops are deployed from Duan Shan east of Jiangyin to Zhoujing Lane east of Wuxi, and the fortifications are solid, so they can be defended for a long time.

The Japanese troops who invaded westward along the Jiahu-Jia Highway, seeing that our army has already built fortifications relying on the mountain danger around Shengshan City and Bali Store, about four kilometers west of Shengshe Town, for the purpose of solid defense, the Japanese army is bound to cross the mountains if they attack from the front of the highway, and they know very well that our large army is gathered around Wuxing. In order to avoid major sacrifices, they have changed their plans to take Changxing through the waterway. The night before last (23rd), a large number of motorboats carrying hundreds of marines suddenly attacked Jiapu Town, which belongs to Changxing County on the southwest bank of Taihu Lake, attempting to land, hoping to cut off the traffic on the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, attack Yixing to the north, go south to Changxing, and strike the back of Wuxing. However, we have already deployed heavy troops around the lake area, and the Japanese army's attempt may not be achieved in a short period of time.

[Nanjing] According to Chinese sources, there are fierce battles underway between Wuxing and Changxing on the shores of Taihu Lake, and there are also fierce battles in the Yixing area. The Japanese troops attacking Yixing crossed Taihu Lake from Wujiang and landed within the territory of Yixing County, attempting to break through Yixing and then go straight to Liyang to invade the capital. However, the Chinese side has gathered heavy troops in that area. This morning, a large number of Japanese aircraft were soaring in the sky over Danyang, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, and other places, carrying out bombings. The artillery battles in the Jiangyin area are still fierce. The rumor that the battery has fallen is extremely unreliable. (Quick News Agency dispatch, 24th)

[Nantong] A total of sixty-one Japanese warships on the Yangtze River off Langshan repeatedly shelled Liuhaisha. Japanese aircraft spied along the river four times on the 23rd. (Special dispatch, 23rd)

### Wuxi City Suffers Repeated Bombings

[Nanjing] According to reliable sources, Wuxi city is still in the hands of the Chinese army to this day, but the fighting is extremely fierce and the situation is very tense. Many Japanese aircraft bombed Wuxi five or six times yesterday, dropping many incendiary bombs. Fires have broken out in many places in the city. A unit of Japanese troops charged to the outskirts of Wuxi the day before yesterday and engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army, leading to rumors of the fall of Wuxi. The large number of Japanese warships gathered in the Yaogang area have been constantly bombarding the Jiangyin Fortress, attempting to break the blockade line, but because the Chinese army's defenses are solid, they have not succeeded to this day. (Quick News Agency dispatch, 24th)

### Suzhou Refugees Flock to Guangfu

Yesterday, the Shanghai Suzhou Fellow Villagers Association released news about Suzhou, saying that our army gradually left Suzhou on the 17th and 18th. Suzhou wounded soldiers moved to Wuxi on the 18th, and Suzhou gentleman Zhang Yi also went there at the same time. Another Suzhou clergyman arrived in Shanghai yesterday, coming from Suzhou to Yixing via Nanjing. He said that a large number of Suzhou refugees are in Guangfu. The Wuxian International Relief Society is already in Nanjing, requesting the American ambassador to send telegrams to Washington and Tokyo to negotiate the demarcation of Dongshan and Xishan on Taihu Lake and Guangfu as refugee zones for Suzhou. Fourteen buildings of Soochow University have been destroyed by bombing. Doctors and nurses from Suzhou Bo Xi Hospital and Changzhou Hospital, who are nursing wounded soldiers, are now going to Guizhou to serve.

### Fierce Fighting at Zhapu and Xiashi

On the entire line of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Roads, it is reported that our army has completed its counter-offensive posture. On the front of the Beijing-Shanghai Road, both sides advanced and retreated in fierce battles yesterday at Wangting Zhoujing Lane south of Wuxi, and we have gained the initiative. It is reported that the sounds of gunfire and cannons can be faintly heard near Suzhou, very clearly. On the left flank, with the Jiangyin Fortress as the starting and ending point, more than 20 Japanese warships gathered and bombarded our blockade line. Our land and naval forces launched a fierce counter-offensive, and it was also heard that the air force had been in action. On the right flank, the Zhapu-Xiashi section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road is also fiercely counter-attacking, maintaining close contact with Wuxing and Wuxi. The details are as follows:

㊀ Beijing-Shanghai Line: The mixed battles on this line have been going on for more than a week. Initially, because our army's deployment was not fully completed, the movement of Qingyang Port and Kunshan to the rear affected the lineup on the left and right. Later, a new defense line was set up between Zhengyi, Suzhou, Weiting, and Wangting in Suzhou to cover the rear. Now, it is gradually being properly sequenced, and advancing and retreating are free. Near Tiger Hill on the outskirts of Suzhou, there are also occasional guerrilla-style charges. ㊁ Sujia Line: The Sujia Line has now become a liaison point for the Japanese army, but the enemy troops advancing westward from Wangjiangjing seem to be afraid to advance boldly in recent days. Between Zhenze, Nanxun, Tongxiang, and Shimen, there are occasional contacts that are like fighting but not fighting. The Japanese army is particularly afraid of our army in Zhapu and Haiyan, threatening the rear of Gongjiashan and Jiaxing. ㊂ Shanghai-Hangzhou Line: On the entire right flank, our army still holds forward troops in Wangdian and Tongxiang northeast of Xiashi, except for the movement of Jiaxing, a stronghold. In recent days, the military strongholds connecting Xiashi with Jiaxing and Jiaxing with Shimen have been destroyed, which is sufficient for long-term resistance. (Huadong News Agency)

### After Japan Makes Demands to Concessions, Britain and America Clarify Stances

Any Treaty Issues Must Be Submitted for Review; Customs Matters Do Not Fall Under the Purview of the Shanghai Municipal Council

Reasonable Demands Can Be Accommodated

Reuter's London dispatch, 24th: According to well-informed sources in London, there is no need to be overly concerned about the overall situation in Shanghai. The Japanese authorities' demands to the Shanghai Municipal Council to prohibit anti-Japanese and other malicious activities, and to dissolve the organs of the Chinese government, including the Kuomintang branch, are not regarded here as coercive measures, since the Japanese army has now occupied Greater Shanghai and naturally does not want to see the Public Concession as a center for anti-Japanese activities. In addition, there are still about one million Chinese living in the Concession, so the Shanghai Municipal Council is responsible for finding ways to accommodate the Japanese demands to a reasonable extent without abandoning any fixed rights. In the future, if issues arise that affect treaties signed between China and foreign governments, they must be submitted to the US government and relevant European governments for review. As for local matters involving consultation with Japanese officials, they are within the purview of the Shanghai Municipal Council.

Reuter's Washington dispatch, November 23: The US State Department has not formally considered the Japanese demands regarding the Shanghai Public Concession. The State Department is now handing this matter over to the local US authorities for handling.

Customs Issues Cannot Be Handled

Havas Washington dispatch, 23rd: Regarding a certain request made by the Japanese military authorities, US Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement to reporters, saying that the Shanghai Municipal Council has directly consulted with the consuls-general of the countries concerned. All items proposed by the Japanese side have been agreed to be handled at discretion, except for one item regarding Chinese customs, which is not within the scope of the Shanghai Municipal Council. It is heard that the Japanese military authorities have expressed satisfaction.

American Consul Gauss to Deal with Matters Expediently

National News Agency Washington dispatch, 23rd: According to the State Department today, if the Japanese attempt to control the Shanghai Concession, the United States will consult with other countries to jointly respond. However, under the current circumstances, the State Department believes that the US Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, can deal with matters expediently without the need to issue special instructions.

Washington Star Comments

National News Agency Washington dispatch, 23rd: The Washington Star said in an editorial today that the various demands made by Japan to the Shanghai Public Concession "include several points that are an act of unparalleled effrontery to Western countries." The newspaper also discussed Japan's demands to control customs and to guarantee tax payments for foreign debts, and said, "It is hoped that countries will not kowtow and comply with these demands, but in view of the recent state of inertia, it is feared that Japan will still be able to take whatever it wants."

### Capital and Guangzhou Attacked Again Yesterday

Anti-Aircraft Guns Roared Like Thunder; Extremely Heavy Damage to Houses and People

[Hong Kong] Seventeen Japanese aircraft, in two groups, took off from Lian Shawan at 6:30 a.m. on the 24th. One group of eight aircraft, via Humen and Huangpu, arrived in the province. They were fiercely attacked by our anti-aircraft guns and dared not fly low. At an altitude of over 10,000 feet, they dropped more than ten bombs over Dashatou and Henan, and attempted to bomb the Haizhu Iron Bridge, but failed to hit it. It is estimated that more than ten houses were destroyed in Dashatou, with more than twenty people killed and injured. One bomb landed on Zhijie Street in Mengsheng Xiakeng, Henan, two bombs landed in Jushili, Ma Chong Bridge, and one bomb each landed near the 31st Elementary School in Xiaogang and the Donghua Yarn Factory in Nanyou, destroying more than one hundred houses and killing or injuring more than four hundred people. Dozens of corpses have been unearthed, and more than one hundred seriously injured have been hospitalized. Another group of nine aircraft flew to bomb the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, and fled the province from the north at 11:00 a.m. The early train from Guangzhou to Hong Kong was attacked by Japanese aircraft three times, but there were no losses. Six Japanese aircraft arrived in Guangzhou at 8:00 a.m. on the 24th, dropping nine bombs, destroying houses and killing people. (Special dispatch, 24th)

[Hong Kong] Eight Japanese aircraft attacked the Guangzhou-Kowloon Road at 3:00 p.m. on the 24th, causing no losses. (Special dispatch, 24th)

[Guangzhou] At 10:45 this morning, five large Japanese aircraft flew over the sky above the city. At one point, the sound of anti-aircraft guns roared like thunder. Many shells exploded around the aircraft, but none seemed to hit. At that time, dense clouds covered the sky, which was very conducive to air raids. The Japanese aircraft dropped bombs in the northeastern part of the city, and soon flew south. According to Hong Kong news, Japanese aircraft dropped many bombs on Henan across from Shamian. It is heard that at least one hundred and sixty-two people were killed, injured, or missing, and thirty houses were destroyed. Also, when Japanese aircraft bombed the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and Guangdong-Hankou Railway in Guangzhou City, about one hundred people were killed or injured in various places. (Reuter dispatch, 24th)

[Nanjing] The capital was attacked again by Japanese aircraft today. About 20 light bombs were dropped on the vicinity of the city center and on both sides of East Zhongshan Road. The number of deaths and injuries has not yet been ascertained by the authorities. It is currently believed that about seven people have died and twelve have been seriously injured. At 1:30 p.m. in the afternoon, the alarm sounded again, which was the third alarm of the day. No Japanese aircraft flew in the first two times. Two Japanese heavy bombers, flying very fast, appeared in the sky at the ringing of the bell. They were followed by two fighter planes. The Japanese aircraft flew over the city and then advanced toward the southeast. At that time, the sound of anti-aircraft guns rumbled loudly. The Japanese aircraft may have dropped bombs at the same time. One bomb fell on the southeast corner of the square of the National Assembly Building, collapsing a wall and shattering many glass windows. The second bomb fell in the middle of East Zhongshan Road, also collapsing a wall and damaging several shops. The third bomb hit the buildings of Li Xi (transliteration) Middle School and severely damaged them. The school is named after a famous Chinese Christian and is managed by American and French persons. The remaining bombs fell in slum areas, and most of the deaths and injuries occurred there. It is said that the Japanese aircraft were forced by very accurate anti-aircraft guns to drop bombs without aiming and flee. (Reuter dispatch, 24th)

[Guangzhou] At 11:45 this morning, eight more Japanese aircraft flew over Shamian and advanced toward the Guangdong-Hankou Railway line, but did not drop bombs. It is believed that the planes must be operating in more distant locations. At 12:35 p.m., the alarm was lifted. In the morning, Japanese aircraft dropped several bombs near Dongshan. One of the bombs fell near the Italian consulate, and the building felt the tremor. Newman, a British official at the Salt Tax Office, who witnessed the bombing of Henan by Japanese aircraft, told Reuter's reporters that he inspected the affected area a few minutes after the bombing and estimated that a total of one hundred people had died. The Japanese aircraft dropped a total of four bombs, and he estimated that each bomb weighed about 500 pounds. Red Cross stretchers and cargo trucks were filled with coffins, and gathered together at one point. Newman highly praised dozens of young Chinese nurses who disregarded the danger and made every effort to rescue the wounded. He also said that Englishman Lancaster and a friend were driving to Henan when a bomb landed in front of their car, only fifty yards away. Both were uninjured, but quickly turned back, also saying it was dangerous. (Reuter dispatch, 24th)

### A Glimpse of Suzhou Creek

Trams Run but Few Pedestrians; Bullet-Ridden and Desolate

Since our troops withdrew from the outskirts of Shanghai, refugees have fled, gathering in the International and French Concessions. Fearing danger in the Shanghai suburbs, most refugees dare not return, leaving the areas outside the concessions almost deserted. This is also the case along Suzhou Creek. Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, a gentleman specifically inspected the Public Concession section of Suzhou Creek, passing through North Xizang Road. He saw that the Route 18 trolleybuses still ran as far as the southern end of the New Rubbish Bridge. Although the north side of the bridge was passable, one had to detour via the Old Rubbish Bridge. West of the New Rubbish Bridge, on the river, apart from a broken boat moored by the Four Banks Warehouse, there was nothing else. However, the section from east of the bridge to the Old Rubbish Bridge was impassable, with boats tightly packed together. Most were empty rice barges or large barges carrying coffins. According to the coffin boatmen, these coffins contained the remains of compatriots of the propertied class, mostly killed by stray bullets and bombs, numbering about several thousand. Crossing the Old Rubbish Bridge, Zhejiang Road to the north could reach Haining Road. Route 6 trolleybuses stopped in front of the First Special District Court. From Haining Road, taking Keneng Hai Road north led to Avenue Edward VII. A small number of children were attending classes at the Chinese Children's Public School there. Taking Keneng Hai Road to North Shansi Road, heading north to the boundary of the North Railway Station, one could see the North Station Grand Hotel in the distance, which had been bombed by Japanese aircraft. Across the street, the houses in Shengshun Lane in the Chinese area were badly damaged. Behind the North Station Grand Hotel (within the concession) and on either side, many buildings were also struck by artillery shells. Returning, still via Avenue Edward VII heading east to North Henan Road, Route 14 trolleybuses were seen running directly to Bazilu intersection, but passengers boarded and disembarked at the Avenue Edward VII intersection. East of Bazilu, pedestrians were nowhere to be seen, with Japanese soldiers guarding the boundary between the Chinese and concession areas. Heading south from North Henan Road, via Haining Road, Wengjian Shi Road, Qipu Road, and Tiantong Road, one could directly reach North Sichuan Road, but pedestrians generally only went as far as North Jiangxi Road. Taking North Jiangxi Road to the waterworks bridge, along North Suzhou Road westward, passing Tianhougong Bridge, to the Old Rubbish Bridge, many boats were also moored in the river. The busiest areas for pedestrians were the Pintangnong Bridge, the Old Zhabei Bridge, and the Old Rubbish Bridge.

### Fragments of American Policy Toward China

— Translated by Ang Ruo

According to those familiar with the inside story, when U.S. Secretary of State Hull converses with people, and there are no diplomatic figures present, the mention of the word "Japan" causes his eyes to widen, even dispelling his relaxed Tennessee country manner. In other words, he is prepared to adopt a tougher policy toward Japan than other cabinet members. The U.S. Ambassador to China hurriedly left Nanjing last time to escape the bombing by Japanese planes because Hull was not in Washington but in New York attending the American Legion convention. Otherwise, this event would not have occurred. On the day Hull rushed back to Washington, the U.S. Ambassador to China also returned to the Nanjing embassy, and the clues are clearly traceable.

Hull's policy on Far Eastern issues can be gleaned from his attitude toward the Treaty of Versailles. He is a fervent supporter of the League of Nations created by the late U.S. President Wilson. When he was a senator, he vigorously supported Wilson's participation in the Triple Entente, with the United States, Britain, and France jointly guaranteeing peace in Europe. Ambassador Bullitt testified in the U.S. Senate against ratifying the Treaty of Versailles, and Hull has never forgiven him for this, which shows the extent to which Hull adheres to Wilson's policies.

When the Sino-Japanese war was intense, the United States was holding the American Legion convention, and amidst the excitement, news from the Far East was inevitably affected. However, Hull still delivered a speech at a banquet, elaborating on his Far Eastern policy, saying, "We have stated that while we are determined to use all methods to avoid war, we cannot 'ignore' those international lawless events that could lead to war or disrupt peace."

You can understand between the lines that Hull, though a sincere believer in peace and a patient man, also believes that there will be an "end" to the Far Eastern situation that cannot be tolerated.

U.S. President Roosevelt holds the same views as Hull on the Far Eastern situation, but with a slight difference. We remember Roosevelt as a major navalist who served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy for eight years during President Wilson's administration. Since being elected president, he has expanded the U.S. Navy to an unprecedented scale within four years, so his views on the Far Eastern issue can be said to be similar to those of the naval faction.

This view is that if Japan occupies China, it will inevitably pose a serious threat to the living standards of white people on the other side of the Pacific.

The difference between Roosevelt and Hull is that Roosevelt still believes that American public opinion is not yet prepared to take a tough stance against Japan, and he is unwilling to get ahead of it. However, Hull recently told his advisors, "As far as public opinion is concerned, you can often wait for Japan to make trouble." We can see that Hull's views are correct by the great uproar caused by Japan's bombing of Nanjing.

We know that the order for U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson to leave the Nanjing embassy and take refuge on a U.S. warship was given by Moore, the 80-year-old Acting Secretary of State. Moore's greatest concern in life is American neutrality. For this reason, he also issued a notice prohibiting the issuance of passports to American doctors and nurses who wanted to serve the government forces in Spain. The prohibition of relief personnel from serving abroad had never happened in American history. When Hull discovered this, he immediately rescinded Moore's notice. The return of the U.S. Ambassador to China to Nanjing was also influenced by Moore's return to Washington from New York.

### Soviet Central Authorities Discuss Foreign Policy

U.S. Invites Russia to Send Representatives to Washington; Expected to Be Related to Dealing with the Overall Situation in the Far East

[Berlin] Today, the "Berliner Tageblatt" reported that Stalin, Voroshilov, Litvinov, Molotov, and Kalinin held a meeting at the Kremlin. It is said that foreign policy was the focus of this meeting. Although the content of the meeting has not been disclosed, it is known that Litvinov's plan to visit various countries next month has been completely cancelled. This change is worth paying attention to. According to the newspaper, the United States still expects Litvinov to accept the U.S. invitation to visit the United States, as this invitation was delivered to Moscow in person by a senior U.S. official. Moreover, this invitation will definitely have an impact on the overall situation in the Far East. It also stated that Soviet Russia recently recalled its ambassadors to foreign countries, such as China, Turkey, Poland, and the Baltic states, all of which are countries bordering it. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)

⊙ Warsaw: Local newspapers published rumors from Moscow diplomatic circles that Litvinov will resign from the post of Foreign Minister. It is said that Litvinov will go to Crimea on the first of next month and will not return. His post is currently temporarily held by Krestinsky, and from next year, it will be officially taken over by Potemkin. It is rumored that Litvinov's resignation was caused by a sharp conflict between him and Yezhov. Yezhov is the Minister of Internal Affairs and head of the political police, and is in charge of the Soviet purge movement. (Haitong News Agency Telegraph, 23rd)

⊙ Moscow: It was announced here yesterday that all final decisions on economic issues will be handled by the newly established "Economic Conference" of the People's Committee. This Economic Conference is composed of the chairman and vice-chairmen of the People's Committee and one representative from the Central Labor Conference, and is chaired by the chairman of the People's Committee. The main task of the new conference is to review and approve all administrative matters related to economic issues, such as determining prices, deciding wages, and various economic plans. Petitions against the decisions of the conference should be submitted to the People's Committee within two days, and to the Soviet republics within one month. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)

### Japan's Anti-British Sentiment

Is Increasingly High-Pitched

[Tokyo] The Kokumin Shimbun commented on the anti-British sentiment in various parts of Japan, saying that the anti-British resolution passed by the public assembly at Hibiya Park on Sunday is a representation of the national sentiment of Japan. The Beijing Conference has failed, and the Chinese government is now in a difficult situation. Britain should reconsider its attitude. Unless Britain recognizes Japan's position in East Asia, abandons its policy of supporting China's anti-Japanese and communist activities, ends its aid entering China from Hong Kong, and recognizes Japan's rights as the victor in Shanghai, Japan will regard Britain as an enemy. (Reuters, 24th)

### Discussing the General International Situation, the Center of European Diplomacy Shifts to London

French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Scheduled to Visit Britain at the End of the Week; U.S. Representative Davis Is Also Invited

[London] Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Eden recently sent invitations to French Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos to come to London this week or early next week to conduct talks on the international situation. It is noted that Lord Privy Seal Halifax recently held talks with German leader Hitler. Now, the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary have invited the French authorities to Britain again. The nature of this is extremely important. It is conceivable that Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Chautemps have never met. (Havas, 24th)

[London] The news from Paris that the British government has invited French Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos to visit London has been confirmed here. It is widely believed that the British government has asked them to come to Britain on Friday and stay in London for two or three days. Whether the date of the visit to Britain can be as the British government wishes will depend on Paris. It is rumored that the Prime Minister and others will come here to have a general discussion on international issues related to the two countries. (Reuters, 24th)

[Paris] When French Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos visit London at the end of this week, they will discuss the attitudes of Italy towards the Sino-Japanese war and other issues with British authorities. The British government has invited French politicians to discuss the situation arising from Halifax's recent talks in Germany with Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Eden. It is now believed that Hitler's demands made to Halifax and the Spanish War are other important issues to be considered. According to London news, these talks will be held on Monday and Tuesday. (Reuters, 24th)

⊙ Brussels: It was learned today that British Prime Minister Chamberlain has invited U.S. representative Davis to London to continue discussions on the Far East issue, and hopes that Davis can visit Britain this Friday, at which time French Prime Minister Chautemps and French Foreign Minister Delbos can also be invited to London, so that the British, French, and American authorities can have further talks. However, it is rumored that Davis has not yet replied, probably waiting for instructions from the U.S. government. (Kokumin, 24th)

[Paris] Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos are scheduled to hold talks with British political figures in London on the 29th and 30th of this month. According to informed sources, the Franco-British talks will report on the results of British Lord Privy Seal Halifax's visit to Germany, and will give Delbos broad powers before he visits Eastern and Central European countries to contact the governments of the relevant countries on the various issues raised by German leader Hitler. In short, the British invitation to the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister to visit Britain this time is sufficient to prove the close relationship between Britain and France. (Havas, 24th)

[London] Regarding the British government's invitation to French Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos to come to London for talks, informed sources recently stated, "This move is an expression of extreme friendship towards France. The main topic of discussion in the Franco-British talks will be the issue of Germany's demand for colonies. The German government believes that from now on, Germany's colonial rights must be recognized. As for whether Britain decides to continue negotiations with Germany or stop them, France's attitude is actually decisive." (Havas, 24th)

### The Beijing Conference Is Postponed; Our Representatives Await Instructions

The Declaration Contains Thirteen Points; We May Propose Important Amendments

⊙ Brussels: The Nine-Power Treaty Conference, originally scheduled to open at 3:00 PM today, has been postponed until this evening because the Chinese delegation has not yet received instructions from its government. King Leopold III received U.S. Chief Representative Davis today. (Havas, 24th)

⊙ Brussels: The report and declaration of the Beijing Nine-Power Treaty Conference have now been agreed upon in principle by all countries' representatives except for the Chinese representative, who has not yet received instructions from Nanjing. However, there may be slight modifications in the wording. Chinese Chief Representative Gu Weijun may apply for another short adjournment at this afternoon's meeting. It is widely believed that Gu may not actually do so, but if he does, it would be expected. The declaration has thirteen points as follows: ㊀ States the importance of international treaties; ㊁ These treaties are institutions to guarantee security and peace; ㊂ The convocation of the Beijing Conference aims to study the Sino-Japanese dispute based on Article 7 of the Washington Treaty; ㊃ China has stated that its military actions are purely defensive in nature and has participated in this conference; ㊄ Japan refuses to participate in the conference; ㊅ The conference seems to have no opportunity to continue carrying out its mission, so it believes that there is a need to temporarily suspend the conference. This move does not imply that the countries have reduced their attention to the Far East; ㊆ Solutions imposed by force cannot be durable solutions, just as direct negotiations cannot produce durable solutions. Any solution must take into account the interests of all parties in the Far East, and when necessary, consult with other countries; ㊇ Reiterate the principles of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty; ㊈ Rapid cessation of hostilities is most beneficial to all parties; ㊉ Advocates stopping hostilities and adopting peaceful procedures to seek solutions; ㊉㊀ The possibility of such peaceful procedures should not be dismissed; ㊉㊁ Time is needed to exchange opinions and seek methods, so the conference has decided to adjourn indefinitely; ㊉㊂ The conference meeting can be convened by the chairman or any two members. This report is dedicated to narrating past events and does not have any new features. (Reuters, 24th)

### Striving to Seek Peace, U.S. Policy Remains Unchanged

[Washington] Someone recently asked President Roosevelt how the Beijing Nine-Power Treaty Conference was going, and Roosevelt replied that he would continue to work hard to consolidate world peace. (Havas, 24th)

⊙ Brussels: U.S. Chief Representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Davis, originally planned to depart for home immediately after the conference announced its indefinite adjournment tomorrow, but has now decided to postpone his departure until December 2. British representative MacDonald has already returned home this afternoon because his father's remains are being transported back to London, and the country's Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Cranborne, is acting as chief representative. (Havas, 23rd)

### British Cabinet Meeting

Listening to the Report of the Privy Seal

[London] The cabinet held a regular meeting this morning. Lord Privy Seal Halifax will present a report on his talks with German leader Hitler. Prime Minister Chamberlain will then attend the House of Commons after the meeting to explain. It is said among people in Congress that, based on Halifax's impressions after visiting Germany, it seems that there is no possibility of immediate negotiations between Britain and Germany. According to the latest news obtained from another source, the German authorities believe that the formal consultation on the trade agreement between Britain and the United States has political implications and therefore do not welcome it. As for various European issues, Hitler seems to have issued a statement that Germany is willing to discuss relevant matters with all countries, but the colonial issue discussed with Halifax this time is limited to those related to Britain and Germany. (Havas, 24th)

[London] British Prime Minister Chamberlain made a statement in the House of Commons today regarding Lord Privy Seal Halifax's visit to Berlin, saying that Halifax's talks with German leader Hitler and others were of a confidential nature and he could not disclose them at this time. However, he was pleased that this trip was valuable and could increase the hope of establishing closer understanding between the two countries. The Prime Minister continued to answer a question from a member, saying that the British government would not make any promises until the House of Commons had the opportunity to discuss it. As for the speculations about Anglo-German negotiations published in various morning newspapers, they were purely irresponsible and inaccurate news. (Reuters, 24th)

[Paris] Regarding the details of British Lord Privy Seal Halifax's recent talks with the German authorities, it was learned that the British government has notified the French government, but French officials refused to comment, saying only that the content of the talks could only be disclosed by the parties involved. (Havas, 23rd)

### German Suggestions

Contain Five Key Points

[London] Informed sources recently stated that when German leader Hitler recently met with British Lord Privy Seal Halifax, he explained Germany's position as follows: ㊀ Germany has always advocated adopting mutually agreed methods; ㊁ Germany is not opposed to the League of Nations and is prepared to rejoin the League of Nations, but with conditions, namely that the League of Nations Covenant, especially Article 16 of the Covenant, must be amended; ㊂ Germany has no territorial ambitions in Central Europe; ㊃ Germany is willing to maintain good relations with the Czech Republic and sign an agreement with the Czech Republic similar to the German-Austrian Agreement of July 11 last year; ㊄ Germany lacks raw materials and must both allow its people to colonize abroad and guarantee its prestige, so it must have colonies. However, Germany can be satisfied at present if it can recognize Germany's right to own colonies, but the colonies must be redistributed later. Although the opinions of Britain, the United States, and Germany on the above issues are very different, how to satisfy Germany's colonial demands in the future will depend on the joint consultation of French Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos with British dignitaries after their visit to Britain. (Havas, 24th)

[Paris] Diplomatic circles learned today that German leader Hitler had proposed five ways to maintain peace in Europe to Lord Halifax: ㊀ Officially recognize Germany's legitimate right to colonies, as a condition for Hitler's promise not to recover the original colonies within six years; ㊁ Britain and France guarantee not to interfere in the peaceful relations between Germany and Austria and the Czech Republic; ㊂ Reiterate Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's claim that the four powers of Europe should preside over the political situation, and the four countries of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy can consult on international issues at any time; ㊃ Britain and France should not take any action to economically attack Germany's existing political system; ㊄ If the above conditions are met, Germany will agree to return to the League of Nations. It is said that Britain is deeply uneasy about Germany's demands and does not know what action to take in the future. At the same time, Foreign Secretary Eden has also notified the French Ambassador Corbin of the content of the demands. (Kokumin, 24th)

### Franco-British Consultation

Berlin Expresses Approval

[Berlin] Regarding the saying that French Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos are going to Britain, political figures here expressed their appreciation, saying that after British Lord Privy Seal Halifax visited Berlin, the politicians of Britain and France will hold consultations on international cooperation, which will naturally strengthen it. It is hoped that the talks between Britain and France will find a solution to help ease the European situation. The implication seems to be that France is an important key to the establishment of negotiations between Britain and Germany. (Havas, 24th)

### Anglo-German Reconciliation

Rome Feels Unhappy

[Rome] Regarding British Lord Privy Seal Halifax's visit to Germany, Italian officials refused to comment, but newspapers reported that Halifax's talks with the German authorities were fruitless and that the trip was of no benefit. The words between the lines were not without a hint of satisfaction. It is noted that during Halifax's visit to Germany, the dispatches sent by reporters stationed in Berlin from various Italian newspapers were very cautious and limited to describing Halifax's itinerary. Only the Giornale d'Italia published an article by a reporter stationed in Paris, advocating that France and Italy promote friendly relations. After this article was published, foreign newspapers generally speculated that relations between Italy and Germany were cooling and that Italy was expressing unhappiness with the attempts at reconciliation between Britain and Germany. The Italian authorities were very angry after hearing about it and ordered the Giornale d'Italia to be detained and the newspaper's reporter stationed in Paris to be recalled. At this time, Italian political figures strongly stated that the political axis between Italy and Germany is stronger than ever, and that the talks between Britain and Germany may not yield concrete results. Regarding the relations between Britain and Italy, it was said that since British Prime Minister Chamberlain recently delivered two speeches advocating the promotion of friendly relations with Italy, there has been no development to date. (Havas, 23rd)

### German Newspapers Praise Our Army's Strategy

Heroic Deeds Will Be Admired by Future Generations Forever

[Berlin] The "Frankfurter Zeitung" military correspondent wrote an article describing the strategy of the Chinese military, declaring that the battles that occurred near Shanghai have brought glory to the young Chinese soldiers, and their heroic deeds will be admired by future generations forever. The correspondent pointed out that the Chinese army engaged in war with a calm and scientific attitude, avoiding large-scale decisive battles in the Japanese army's base areas on the one hand, and inducing the enemy to penetrate deep on the other hand. On the other hand, it paid extraordinary attention to discipline and order. These two factors have made China a truly unified country and strengthened its belief in resisting the enemy. The article concluded that the Chinese government's command of its vast territory at this time is more flexible than it was at the beginning of the war. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)

### Wang Zhengting Appeals to the United States

International Illegal Acts; How Can the Powers Sit Idly By?

[New York] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting rebuked the countries that love peace for placing too much emphasis on the gains and losses of aiding China's resistance against Japan at a youth association luncheon today, saying, "The majority of countries in the world love peace, and their economies and strength are far above those of the countries that love to fight. It is not impossible to stop all illegal acts in the international arena. Although there are sacrifices in stopping illegal acts, these sacrifices are not without cost and use. If a neighbor is careless, we still try to help put out the fire to avoid it spreading. Now that a neighbor is in trouble, should countries that love peace sit idly by and not help?" He continued, "The international attitude has reached the extreme of stagnation, and countries that love peace are willing to see treaties broken. What can we do..." (Kokumin, 23rd)

### Ugaki's Remarks

Expose Territorial Ambitions

[Tokyo] Former Governor-General of Korea, Ugaki Kazushige, one of Prime Minister Konoe's ten councilors, said today when talking with foreign reporters that the Japanese government is still abiding by its repeated declarations that Japan has no territorial ambitions in China, but if the war is prolonged and Japan's sacrifices and deaths increase as a result, then the wishes of the Japanese people will inevitably change.

### Chen Gongbo Discusses European Mission

Will Travel to Paris from Brussels

Brussels After arriving here yesterday, Chinese Special Envoy Chen Gongbo spoke to reporters, stating that the purpose of his trip is to inform Chinese ambassadors to European countries about the situation in the Far East. He met with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Rome yesterday, and regarding Italy's participation in the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact, Italian political figures have said that this action is not related to the Sino-Japanese dispute. Since the dispute has been submitted to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference for handling, the conference should promptly seek a satisfactory resolution in accordance with the principles of the treaty. Chen is scheduled to travel to Paris within days. (Havas, 23rd)

### Britain and Italy Actively Deploy in the Mediterranean

[London] The "Standard Evening News" recently reported that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is expected to travel to the Italian-controlled island of Rhodes in the eastern Mediterranean within a few weeks to inaugurate a newly constructed naval and military base. This action demonstrates the extreme importance of Italy's position in the Mediterranean and will prompt Britain to promptly conduct direct negotiations with Italy on the issue of the eastern Mediterranean. Regarding this matter, well-informed sources recently stated that Britain is actively reinforcing its defenses on the British-controlled island of Cyprus in the far eastern Mediterranean. Once completed, the entire project will become the newest type of fortress in the Mediterranean, standing alongside Gibraltar and Malta. However, the progress of the project is highly confidential. When the House of Commons was in session, members of various parties raised questions about this matter, but all cabinet members remained tight-lipped. Italy's construction of a naval and military base on Rhodes is in response to this British action. (Havas, 22nd)

[Rome] Reports that the Italian Prime Minister will travel to Rhodes to inaugurate a newly constructed naval and military base have recently been denied by officials. (Havas, 24th)

### Yugoslav Prime Minister Scheduled to Visit Rome

Rome Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović is scheduled to visit here on the fifth of next month. Italian authorities will host him with a grand ceremony. (Havas, 24th)

### China National Aviation Corporation Opens New Hankou-Hong Kong Route

Via Chongqing, Guiyang, and Wuzhou

[Tokyo] According to a telegram received from a certain source on the 24th, China National Aviation Corporation, a Sino-American joint venture established in 1928, has opened a new air route from Hankou via Chongqing to Hong Kong. The route runs from Hankou to Yichang, then to Chongqing, and then to Guiyang in Guizhou Province, then to Longzhou in Guangxi Province, and from Wuzhou to Hong Kong. The route from Longzhou to Annam (Vietnam) is connected to it, thus connecting air transport between Annam and Hankou. This is considered highly important from a military standpoint. (Domei, 24th)

### French Government Announces Truth About Political Conspiracy

Masked Group's Military Plan Exposed, Plotting to Overthrow Republic and Restore Empire

[Paris] After a thorough investigation by the police over several days, the French Ministry of the Interior today issued a public statement, disclosing the shocking news that a masked group had secretly plotted to cause internal unrest, overthrow the republican government, establish a dictatorship first, and then restore the empire. The police also discovered a topographic map of the residence of former Prime Minister Blum in the group's documents, as well as a plan for a joint attack on the Chamber of Deputies. However, the documents did not specify when the attack would begin. The police obtained signatures and seals of approval from several cabinet members, as well as a list of cabinet members and deputies they intended to arrest. It is reported that this organization is divided into general offices and four sections (numbered 1-4), and the members are divided into divisions, brigades, regiments, and battalions. The police also discovered ⑴ equipment for producing false identification documents, ⑵ instructions for transporting weapons, ⑶ information on the names of commanders and units stationed in Paris and its vicinity, ⑷ information on equipment of several armies, ⑸ blank army forms stolen from military agencies, ⑹ a map of the Paris sewers and the routes leading to the Chamber of Deputies, ⑺ maps of left-wing newspaper offices, and ⑻ maps of the residences of socialist deputies. The police also seized plans on how to seize vehicles from the Paris transportation bureau and transportation workers on canals and highways outside Paris to use them as offensive weapons. The statement said that although the conspirators' plans were meticulous, they were ultimately exposed due to the government's diligent prevention efforts. The Republican government has the trust of the people, and the conspiracies of the rebellious parties are not to be feared. Judging from what the police have discovered, this secret organization is entirely managed by the army. The police are still conducting a thorough search and will severely punish the rebels. The government has the confidence to contain them. The government has issued arrest warrants for five people, including Talanker, the current president of several shipping companies, and a certain Mr. So-and-so, a former captain in his sixties. (Reuter, 25th)

[Paris] Regarding the case of the masked group secretly storing weapons and plotting rebellion, the left-wing "Evening News" recently reported that the police had conducted a search of the villa owned by the late French perfume magnate Coty in Rouvray-Saint-Denis. There, they discovered several steel-reinforced concrete cellars sixteen meters underground and a secret tunnel more than one hundred meters underground. The structure was extremely sophisticated, equipped with electric lights and leading to several halls. Although there were no windows on the outside, there were special air regulation devices. Every ten meters along this tunnel, there was a square board connected to the sewers, leading directly to the Seine River. The newspaper also stated that after Coty acquired the villa more than ten years ago, he immediately renovated and transformed it according to ancient castle designs found in the National Library. To maintain secrecy, the workers used were selected from foreign workers and were dismissed after fifteen days of work, with new workers being hired in their place. In addition, according to the right-wing "Paris Evening News," the police, after discovering a secret cellar in an apartment in Place Vendôme a few days ago, arrested five suspects related to the construction of the cellar this afternoon. (Havas, 23rd)

### New Belgian Cabinet Formed

Liberal Party's Janson as Prime Minister, Spaak Remains as Foreign Minister

Brussels The new cabinet, organized by former Liberal Party member Janson, has recently been formed, including three Liberal Party members, six Socialist Party members, three Catholic Party members, two Catholic Democratic Party members, and one non-partisan member. The list of key cabinet members is as follows:

This is the first time since 1884 that a Belgian cabinet has not been led by the Catholic Party. All members of the new cabinet took their oaths before King Leopold III this morning and are scheduled to attend Parliament next Tuesday to deliver the new cabinet's policy statement. (Havas, 24th)

Brussels New Prime Minister Janson was born in Brussels in 1872 and is one of Belgium's most famous lawyers. He was first elected as a Member of Parliament in 1910, served as Minister of the Army in 1920, and as Minister of Justice from 1927 to 1931. After 1931, he served as a Minister without Portfolio and repeatedly served as a Belgian representative to the League of Nations. He was appointed as a Senator from 1932 to 1936, and after his term expired in 1936, he abandoned political life. After the resignation of the Theunis cabinet, negotiations to form a cabinet lasted for three weeks without success. In the end, Janson's comeback resolved the cabinet crisis and led to the formation of the new cabinet. (Havas, 24th)

### Italy Establishes Special Court for National Defense

Trying Espionage Cases

[Rome] Regarding the recent trial of spies by Italy's special court for national defense, the authorities are being extremely secretive, not allowing newspapers to disclose any information about the case.

Foreign Ministry Denies, Establishing a Neutral Zone

[Hankou] It is rumored that various ambassadors have suggested to both China and Japan that a neutral zone be established in Nanjing. A spokesperson for our Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement to this newspaper, saying that foreigners have suggested establishing a safety zone in Nanjing to prevent conflicts between Chinese and Japanese troops in the area to protect civilians. This suggestion is purely charitable and has no political implications. Our government has not officially received the suggestion and has not considered it. The so-called establishment of a neutral zone is completely out of the question. (Special Dispatch, 24th)

### Joint Association of the First Special District Promotes Relief Work

The Civic United Association of the First Special District of this city, in view of the surge in refugees in the concessions in the three months since the Shanghai war, although various sectors have enthusiastically donated and provided extensive supplies, still feel unable to manage the situation. With the harsh winter approaching and refugees facing starvation and cold, if the entire citizenry is not mobilized to jointly devise relief efforts, the future will be unbearable to contemplate. Therefore, it has been resolved to organize a Refugee Relief Committee to cooperate with the municipal authorities and various relief agencies to carry out relief efforts. It is understood that the association is scheduled to hold its first plenary committee meeting today to elect officials, formulate various measures, and actively promote relief work.

President Taki is currently preparing to make it specific, and it is expected to be completed by the end of December. This bill is to prepare for future wars or other major emergencies, with national defense and national policy as the center, to mobilize all people and materials in the country. It will include all laws related to the current situation, such as exchange controls, restrictions on exports and imports, and the Temporary Funds Adjustment Law and the Military Industry Mobilization Law, under the same plan so that the law can be enacted with an implementation order in the event of an emergency. (Domei, 24th)

### Strategies of Both Sides in the Sino-Japanese War

— Written by Upton Close, Translated by Someone

The Sino-Japanese War, like a two-headed dragon in the East, has two faces—one is a local war in China, and the other is an international struggle that is just beginning.

First, let us consider the local war aspect. China's tactics are special, but her vision is far-reaching. Her plan is to prepare for defeats everywhere, but to prepare for continued resistance everywhere. This is the same plan that the Russians used to burn Moscow before Napoleon attacked, and ultimately defeat Napoleon. Although this plan will cause great losses to China, its losses to Japan may be even greater. Because vast China has cities that can be burned and lives that can be taken, as long as the price is that each burned city can tie down more than 50,000 Japanese soldiers, it can trap all Japanese soldiers in the quagmire of the vast Chinese interior.

This is the "flypaper" tactic. If this tactic works, the superior Japanese army will be stuck in trenches thousands of miles away from its homeland, scattered along various front lines, without sufficient transportation and supplies. Then, like insatiable flies, they will be unable to escape. The more the Chinese army can lure the Japanese army deep, the longer the Chinese government can make the Japanese front line, the more concentrated its forces, and the greater the Japanese financial burden, the greater China's hope of victory.

The "brain" directing this strategy of resisting aggression is a small but determined group of Chinese patriots who are uniting a previously loosely organized country and inspiring a national enthusiasm for resisting Japan.

It is the tactics of this group of people that are overturning Japan's intended plan of aggression. Because what Japan initially expected to be a secondary local war in the north has now become a primary war throughout China, requiring it to fight not only the slightly inferior army in the north, but also the best central army, which is simultaneously aided by modern air force.

Making Shanghai a second Pompeii (an ancient Roman city destroyed by a volcano) is the second important condition for completely overturning Japan's initial plan. Japan's main reason for attacking Shanghai was to destroy commerce and finance, but secretly, and without any publicity, Shanghai's bankers shipped cash south several weeks before the war broke out. Therefore, 600 million yuan in gold was stored in Hong Kong's treasury, so even if the central government lost Shanghai, it could not cause China to collapse financially, especially after Finance Minister Kong obtained huge loans in Europe.

This is the tactical web woven by Chinese patriots. The military leaders in Tokyo have already swallowed more land than they planned to digest, and they are still struggling to expand the war, blockading 2,150 miles of Chinese coastline, and searching foreign merchant ships for wartime contraband. These things naturally make them feel a little overwhelmed, even though they are self-deceptively thinking that this is not a war, but merely a kind of "punishment."

This situation has caused serious international disputes. Westerners will naturally become anxious when the war develops to Guangzhou in the far south. Because nearby British Hong Kong is extremely unwilling for Japan to destroy or annex the trade in that area, which is of great benefit to Britain. If the British lion sees the superior Japanese army occupy Guangzhou, which is only a cannon shot away from Hong Kong, it will definitely roar madly (though not to the point of rising up to devour).

If Guangzhou is lost and no longer a Chinese port, France will also be drawn into the center of the vortex. Because from the map, with Guangzhou destroyed and the Chinese coastline blockaded, large amounts of Chinese military supplies will have to be transported from the port of French Indochina (Vietnam) in the far south of China, through that railway into the Chinese interior. With China's military supply imports from Britain and the United States cut off, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will inevitably rely more on French and Soviet supplies of aircraft parts. As the war continues, the reduction of Chinese aircraft is to be expected, and China must remedy this deficiency. The strengthening of Sino-Soviet friendship therefore has two aspects of significance. First, it is enough to make Japan limit its air force strength used in China to around 1,000 aircraft, in order to defend against the Soviet Siberian air force. Second, the Sino-Soviet treaty can not only increase the morale of the Chinese army, but also, if China can tie down 300,000 Japanese troops within its borders until the Japanese economy collapses, then the extent of Soviet assistance will be able to expand. If Japan attacks Outer Mongolia, then the Soviet Union will have to provide more assistance due to treaty relations.

Therefore, China's opportunities are very favorable, as long as the Chinese army fights on and continues to replenish itself. What the future of the Sino-Japanese War will be remains a question, but the appearance of the Soviet bear may turn the entire situation around. General Vasily Blyukher (Galen), the commander of the Soviet Far East Army, is naturally a powerful figure in this. Blyukher has 700 of the best aircraft under his command, and 250,000 mechanized troops at his disposal. In Vladivostok, he also has many secret midget submarines under his control.

In this regard, Blyukher is a notable figure. On the other hand, the main international aspect of the current war is that Japan's offensive, as well as eliminating Western interests, trade, and privileges in the East. Japan disregards Western protests, forcibly deals with foreign concessions and leased territories, oppresses the British and American people, shoots British ambassadors, and adopts illegal blockades of foreign transport imports—all of this tells the white man that his days on the Chinese coast are numbered, unless he uses force to maintain them. Translator's note: This article was published in the American magazine "China Weekly Review." The original author is quite familiar with the situation in China. However, the attitude of this original author is not what the translator agrees with. There are many places that distort the facts. Of course, a white man, from his own standpoint, can make such observations about China's resistance, but such an attitude, from the perspective of a Chinese person, feels somewhat uneasy. Therefore, I have completely deleted many of the parts that distort the facts. This should be stated in the accompanying note at the end.

### Rice Continues to Arrive, Food Supplies Gradually Increasing

Rice Shops in Both Concessions Can Open for Retail Today; Second Batch Has Arrived, Third Batch Arriving Today; First Batch of Tribute Rice Allocated to Relief of Refugees

The Jia Ying vessel, which imported a large batch of rice on the 21st of this month, is moored in the Huangpu River off the Bund of the French Concession. Since the barges hired were too small, only over a thousand bags were distributed to the various shops by the Rice Merchants Association on the 23rd, starting at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, only to the twenty-five rice shops in the French Concession. It is reported that larger barges have been used for unloading starting yesterday. Before 2 o'clock in the afternoon, about 150 shops were dispatched to the French Concession, and about 100 shops were dispatched to the International Settlement. Therefore, by yesterday, there were already more than 200 rice shops in both concessions selling rice at retail. The remaining two hundred plus stores will be able to distribute rice to each store to meet public demand. These tribute rice is transported by the Rice Merchants Association in trucks and distributed to the rice shops in the two concessions for retail sales. It is estimated that unloading will not be completed until tonight, and the rice will be delivered directly from the docks without going to the warehouses.

Rice Shops Reopen

Two hundred rice shops, including Wanchang, in the French Concession reopened completely before 6 p.m. yesterday after receiving the foreign rice. Three hundred rice shops, including Deng Rentai, in the International Settlement are scheduled to reopen this morning after receiving the foreign rice. Retail sales at each rice shop are limited to one yuan per person, but the congestion of buyers is unprecedented. The police department temporarily sent Chinese and Western detectives to maintain order in front of each rice shop. In general, demand exceeded supply, and the forty bags of rice allocated to each shop were sold out soon after being retailed.

Second Batch Arrives

The second batch of 29,000 bags of rice, carried by the British vessel Fuson, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and began to be unloaded yesterday morning. The Concession authorities dispatched police to protect the unloading and distribution to the warehouses in the two concessions. The rice will be distributed to the registered rice shops by the Rice Merchants Association for retail sales. The third batch of 30,000 bags of rice is scheduled to arrive today, carried by the vessel Kodason, sailing from Hong Kong. Subsequent batches of rice will also arrive in Shanghai one after another, so the Shanghai public need not worry about food shortages.

Continued Distribution

The Rice Merchants Association issued an urgent notice today regarding the distribution of the second batch of rice: "It has been verified that the first batch of registered rice distribution has been sent out one after another. The second batch of rice ships has arrived at the port waiting to be unloaded, and the rice distribution procedures urgently need to be handled. All registered rice shops in the International Settlement and the French Concession in the first batch must register with this association from the 25th to the 27th of this month. If you miss the deadline, the third batch of procedures will be handled. The second batch of registration methods are as follows: ⑴ When coming to the association, bring the official store name stamp and pay 10 yuan in miscellaneous car fees. After review by the association, a rice purchase application will be issued. ⑵ Each member must prepare sufficient funds within the time limit and pay the full amount at the Office of the Bank of China at No. 276 Sichuan Road to await distribution. Do not delay."

Relief for Refugees

According to a notification from the French Municipal Council received by the International Relief Committee yesterday, 800 bags of foreign rice loaded by Jia Ying vessel were allocated to the shelters run by various groups in the French Concession to meet the needs of refugee relief. The Association will immediately notify the persons in charge of the various refugee shelters in the French Concession to bring the shelter's seal and the original letter to the Association to obtain the warehouse receipt.

### Two Thousand Starving in Refugee Camp

International Relief Committee Distributes Dry Rations for Emergency; Chinese Red Cross Sets Up Medical Clinic to Treat Sick Refugees

The International Relief Committee, in view of the impoverished households in the Nanshi refugee area, where traffic with the French Concession is cut off, and food supplies have long been exhausted, with no place to buy grain within the area, resulting in widespread starvation, has specially arranged for registration. As of recently, the number of households in the area without food who have registered has reached three thousand, totaling approximately twenty thousand people or more. The committee has also set up food distribution points at Yishengtang, the paper trade association on Kaiyou Road, and Shangzhi Primary School in Jiumudi, where each person can receive two pieces of bread and two Guangbing biscuits daily with a food voucher. It is also learned that there are at least another sixty to seventy thousand residents in the area, whose food supplies are only sufficient for a few days, and in the future, they will all need to be supplied by the committee. The 1,600 bags of foreign rice purchased have already been transported in, but there is a shortage of fuel, salt, and vegetables, and it is hoped that all sectors will donate to provide assistance. In addition, the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, considering the suffering of refugees in the area due to illness, has, through the efforts of Mr. Yang Yanjin, reached an agreement with the Relief Committee to have Chinese medicine practitioners provide joint diagnosis and treatment in the area starting immediately, and provide 200 doses of Chinese medicine daily free of charge. Furthermore, the China-Belgium Entertainment Association has also established an obstetrics hospital in the area to benefit refugee pregnant women.

### China Child Welfare Association Expands Accommodation

### Children's Shelter Finds New Location

According to a recent survey, there are a total of 200,000 people in the Nanshi refugee area, including approximately 20,000 children aged one to three, and approximately 35,000 children aged four to fourteen. The China Child Welfare Association had already established a children's shelter at the Jinye Vocational School on Baker Road, accommodating over 180 children. Recently, it plans to expand operations and also accommodate children from the refugee area, so it is actively seeking a spacious new location and preparing to relocate as soon as possible. It is learned that, through the introduction of Mr. Zhao Jinqing, the association's Deputy General Secretary, Chen Tiesheng, has consulted with Mr. Qu Bohe, the principal of St. John's Middle School for Boys, who has generously agreed to temporarily lend the school buildings. The children's shelter will move to the new location at the beginning of next month, with the capacity to accommodate 500 to 1,000 children.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Announces Refugee Population Statistics

According to a report from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department, as of the 23rd of this month, the refugee shelters inspected by the department numbered 147, accommodating a total of 87,641 people.

### Ningbo Authorities Permit Shanghai-Ningbo Line to Continue Operating as Usual

Shanghai-Tianjin Line Collects Winter Surcharges; Portuguese Merchants Plan to Open Inland River Route

The Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route, after the Ningbo native association in Shanghai dispatched a special representative, Wu Yaqin, on the De Ping ship of the Wah Yih Company the other day to Ningbo, to request the Ningbo authorities to maintain the Shanghai-Ningbo navigation, it is heard that it has been approved by the Ningbo authorities to temporarily continue operation. The Wah Yih Company's De Ping ship returned to Shanghai from Ningbo at 3 PM yesterday and entered the port at 7 AM this morning, docking at the Jinliyuan wharf. It is scheduled to sail to Ningbo again at 3 PM today. The company's announcement reads: "The Wah Yih Company's De Ping ship will depart from Jinliyuan wharf at 3 PM on the 25th of this month (Thursday) for Ningbo. From November 24th, tickets will be sold at the company's ticket office at 123 Guangdong Road."

Shanghai-Tianjin Line Collects Winter Surcharges

The steamships operating on the Shanghai-Tianjin line, such as the Shun Tian, Sheng Jing, De Sheng, and Ze Sheng of the British Swire and Jardine Matheson companies, are now, due to the arrival of winter, collecting winter surcharges as per annual practice. The two companies jointly announced yesterday: "Starting from December 4th, 1937 (Republic of China Year 26), all goods shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin will be subject to an increased winter surcharge, levied at 15% of the water freight rate. We hope that our esteemed customers will take note."

Shanghai-Taizhou Line Approved to Sail Today

The British-owned Shenfu ship, operating on the Shanghai-Dinghai-Taizhou line, is scheduled to set sail from Shanghai for the first time at 3 PM today. For cargo booking and ticket purchases, please contact the Taiji Business Company at 37 Avenue Edward VII. No tickets will be sold elsewhere.

Portuguese Merchants Plan to Open Inland River Regular Ships

Inland river ships have been suspended for a long time. It is now heard that Portuguese merchants have organized the Deqi Inland Navigation Company, which has established an office at 612 North Suzhou Road. More than a dozen small steamships and company ships flying the Portuguese flag are docked in the Suzhou Creek. It is reported that the shipping routes will be to the inland areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and planning is currently underway. Once finalized, an announcement will be made to commence operations, so that transportation to various inland locations can be partially restored first, and then gradually expand the routes.

Shanghai-Tongzhou Line Unobstructed

Recently, transportation between Shanghai and the inland areas has been entirely maintained by the Shanghai-Tongzhou line. All mail and other items are mostly transferred through this line. Due to the outbreak of war in the Fushan Port-Changyinsha area, all seaports along the Yangtze River were closed. Therefore, all sectors were concerned that the shipping line might be interrupted. However, according to an investigation by a New News Agency reporter, the foreign ships operating on the Shanghai-Nantongzhou line include the British Swire Company's Wuhu and Wuxue, the Jardine Matheson Company's Ping He and Tong He, and the Italian Wah Yih Company's En De, among other five ships, running back and forth as usual. Although there is warfare along the Yangtze River in Tongzhou, the above five ships are still operating as usual. Although the mouths of the various rivers have been closed, the authorities, in order to maintain transportation, have reopened the west wharf of Tianshenggang to allow ships to pass. It is also learned that Swire's Wuhu ship sailed as usual yesterday morning, with both passengers and cargo being very crowded.

### Foreign Ships Resuming Service to Shanghai Will Take Time

Since the August 13th Incident, inland river and ocean-going ships have been suspended. Now that the battle lines have moved westward, the various shipping routes will gradually resume operations. The details are described separately below.

Darrah Negotiating Wharf

The President liners of the American-owned Dollar Steamship Lines, operating between the Pacific and Shanghai, number more than seventeen. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, the Shanghai line has been suspended for more than three months. Recently, because the battle lines have moved westward and Wusong has temporarily become peaceful, the company must first prepare the Bailianjing wharf in order to allow ships arriving in Shanghai to dock. The blockade line at the Bund has been destroyed by the Japanese army, but the ban on traffic between Bailianjing and Shanghai is very strict. More than a dozen staff members are trapped inside the wharf and unable to come to Shanghai. In recent days, they have had difficulties with food and drink, and supplies of oil and salt have been cut off for more than ten days. The company has repeatedly tried to negotiate with the Japanese side, but to no avail. Even requests to the American Consul for travel permits are not granted, so the wharf cannot resume operations, and the resumption of President liners to Shanghai is difficult to achieve in the short term.

Each Ship Resuming Service to the Far East

Shanghai is a major port in the Far East. In the past, the average number of foreign ships from Europe and the United States entering Shanghai each month was between 450 and 500. After the outbreak of the war, nine-tenths were diverted to Hong Kong, and some were diverted to Manila. Only ships from France, Italy, and Java still came to Shanghai, but only five or six ships per month, accounting for only 1% of the previous amount. Although several companies have now resumed operations, it is still less than 5% compared to before the war. According to various foreign shipping companies in Shanghai yesterday, although the war risk insurance rates of European and American insurance companies will be reduced, the Sino-Japanese war is spreading, and shipping companies generally believe that business in Shanghai is slack and there is no need to resume service. It will be necessary to wait another six months before resuming service, generally starting from March next year. Starting from next month, only a few temporary services will be opened on a trial basis.

### Wounded Policeman Finally Dies a Martyr

French Troops Enthusiastically Provide Care; Truly Inspiring Awe

Tian Xinshan, a young man from Anhui Province, twenty-three years old, served as a first-class policeman in the 10th platoon of the 2nd company of the machine gun squad of the Shanghai Police Brigade. On the 12th of this month, during the battle in southern Shanghai, he was shot in the waist by enemy machine gun fire and fell to the ground. He was rescued by French naval soldiers stationed nearby and sent to a French warship anchored in the Huangpu River. The military doctor carefully treated him, but his injuries gradually worsened, and he was transferred to the isolation hospital of Guangci Hospital on the 19th. He eventually died of his injuries the other day. The hospital notified the French Concession Police, who transported the remains to the coroner's office, and reported to the Second Special Court to send personnel to verify the cause of death. The remains were coffined and buried by the Tongren Fuyuan Branch. The French troops stationed there enthusiastically rescued and treated our wounded soldiers on the battlefield, and their reputation is commendable, causing the Chinese people to feel awe and respect.

### Rumors of Suspension of Shishi Xinbao and Other Newspapers Inaccurate

According to Shenshi News, yesterday, foreign newspapers in Shanghai reported that five major newspapers had successively suspended publication. It has now been learned that, in addition to the Min Bao and Li Bao, which have voluntarily suspended publication, the Shishi Xinbao, Zhonghua Ribao, and Shenzhou Ribao are still continuing to publish today, so the rumors of suspension are inaccurate.

### Japanese Side Agrees to Reopen Hongkou and Yangshupu Areas

Allowed Westerners to Retrieve Winter Clothing

According to Shenshi News, British and American expatriates residing in the war zones of Hongkou and Yangshupu, due to the increasingly cold weather, have not retrieved much of their winter clothing and supplies. Consuls-General of various countries in Shanghai have repeatedly requested the Japanese military authorities to open the areas so that they can go and retrieve their clothing. It has now been learned that the Japanese side has agreed to open the areas from the 27th of this month to the 1st of next month. All Westerners who previously resided in the area can go to retrieve their clothing or furniture. It is stipulated that the Hongkou area will be opened on the 27th and 28th, and the Yangshupu area will be opened from the 29th to the 1st of next month.

### Obstacles on Avenue Edward VII and Other Locations Removed

When the war situation was urgent, the French Concession authorities closed the iron gates at the intersections of the Chinese and French concessions and added defensive materials such as barbed wire to maintain the peace and security within the Concession. At the intersections of Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Foch, and other streets at the junction of the British and French Concessions, barbed wire was also placed and sandbags were piled up for protection. Now that the focus of the war has shifted westward and the situation in the Shanghai Concession is gradually returning to normal, the barbed wire and sandbags at the intersections of Avenue Edward VII and other streets at the junction of the British and French Concessions have been removed to facilitate transportation.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Food Panic Problems

— Liu

In the recent ten days, the Shanghai food market suddenly fell into an extremely tense state. The doors of most rice shops are posted with "Rice is sold out. Will be sold again upon arrival." Even restaurants are posted with "No rice available. Only noodles." The most painful ones are the catered meal businesses, who are facing the risk of being out of food. Even if they send their associates to the rice shops to buy rice for "one dollar," it is still difficult to meet the needs of the catered meals. Therefore, those who eat catered meals often have no rice to eat, suffering without food. As for the crowds of rice buyers in front of the rice shops, although they are repeatedly whipped, the cries of pain from men, women, old and young are ignored, and they do not retreat slightly in order to obtain this "one dollar" of rice to maintain their current lives. "To get it is to live, to not get it is to die." Gold, diamonds, and jewelry are ashamed of it.

The biggest reason for this rice shortage is the sudden outbreak of war in Nanshi. Since the abandonment of Zhabei and the retreat to western Shanghai, rice boats from the north and south have gathered in Nanshi. Unexpectedly, the war in Nanshi broke out again. Although the rice merchants have tried their best to appeal for permission to release the civilian ships, it was only after several consultations that permission was granted, but the sound of gunfire had already begun. On the one hand, this large supply was lost, and on the other hand, people were panicked and competed to buy rice to ensure their meals. As a result, the rice shops were emptied, and finally closed their doors and ceased operations. The severity was even greater than during the initial outbreak of the Shanghai war. In addition, the war zone has expanded, and many people have fled to Shanghai, increasing the population and cutting off the food supply, which has inevitably led to panic.

Fortunately, in recent days, Saigon rice has arrived, but it is only a drop in the bucket. Therefore, most rice shops still cannot open for business. Even with the "one dollar" low-priced sale, the rice merchants sell at the original cost without adding any markup (equivalent to 13.6 yuan per market right). Other rice shops have changed to selling flour and sliced noodles to meet the demand. This is a truly unprecedented phenomenon. It is heard that the leaders of the rice industry in our country have been negotiating with all parties for days to provide relief to the Shanghai food market, making great efforts and obtaining the assistance of all parties. The food panic should gradually be alleviated. In the next ten days, foreign rice will continue to arrive, and more than 400,000 bags of foreign rice have been ordered. A month later, the food supply will be abundant. If the Nanshi rice boats can be released early, after these rice boats return empty, it will not be difficult to transport rice to Shanghai again to meet the sales. It is believed that all parties know the importance of food for the people and have no intention of increasing panic.

### Investigation of Nanshi Fire

Most of the Buildings Were Burned Down, Only Over Two Thousand Structures Intact

Since the withdrawal of our army from Nanshi, the great fire has raged for ten days. It is not related to the war, but still burns repeatedly, causing most of the houses to be destroyed, destroying the property of merchants and civilians, and the purpose is unknown. The following is a general survey of the situation: The area from southeast of Fenglin Bridge, Xuxu Road, Xietu Road, Jumen Road, West Zhalan, Gaochang Temple, to South Railway Station Road, turning towards Hugunying, Lujiabang, Daxing Street, Huangjiaque Road, Xiaoximen, Xiaonanmen, east of Dongjiadu Catholic Church, east of Wangjia Wharf, entering the city from the Big Wharf, and bounded by Zhaojiabang, Sanpailou, and Sipailou, can be said to have been completely reduced to ashes. Except for the Huashang Tram Company, Waterworks, Qiuxin Factory, etc., which suffered no damage, the Dongjiadu Tianquan Church was also preserved. Among the cultural institutions, Minli Middle School and Qingxin Girls' Middle School were also unharmed. The dormitory of the local court and the large cooking pot in the detention center have now been transformed into a cooking center. The Nanshi Fire Brigade, including the Southeast, West, and Dongjiadu Catholic Church Fire Brigades, were either bombed or burned, and none are intact. The Confucius Temple Park was also destroyed, but the temple buildings alone were able to remain. Therefore, north of the local court to Lujiabang, only Liyuan Road was burned in the middle, and there was no other loss. The Lishe vegetable market in Lujiabang was bombed. The Zhonghua Vocational School and Datong University, the highest and best schools in Nanshi, were also completely destroyed. The Zhonghua Iron Factory was also destroyed. Near the Bund area, the area around Laiyi Wharf and Dongjiadu was not destroyed, but the Nanhui Guild Hall and Wanyu Street Wangjia Wharf on both sides were destroyed. On the Big Wharf side, the Bund at the very edge is still intact, but inside, all the way to Xian Guajie outside the East Gate is a scorched earth. In the city, the area from Sanpailou and Sipailou to Zhaojiabang Taiping Street was almost completely burned down, west to Chuanxinhe Bridge Shipinong, and east to Caiyi Street east of Xianji Bridge. Xiaoqiaotou, Hongqiao, Penglai Road, and Ninghe Road also suffered nine out of ten disasters. What is completely intact in the city are the East Street, Yuhang Bridge, and the area around Fangbanqiao Laoximen Heping Road. The Tangjiawan area did not suffer a single disaster. The number of houses currently inhabited is only about two thousand. Cultural institutions and schools, apart from Qingxin and Minli, number no less than a hundred, whether public or private, and have all been destroyed. In the area of Xiqiao Liyuan Road, which was originally a district of guild halls and side houses, most have also been affected by the fire. In total, the detailed situation of the Nanshi fire needs to be thoroughly investigated, but the total loss of the entire city is incalculable.

Furthermore, in the Nanshi area, starting at 1 PM yesterday, six more houses were set on fire. For a time, black smoke billowed into the sky, and the situation was fierce. The fire locations included Xiaodongmen, Xian Guajie, Dananmen, Linyin Road, Qiaojia Road, etc., with the Xiaodongmen area being the most severe. As of dusk, it had not subsided slightly.

### Silver and Banking Trade Associations Extend Coupon Contract with Ministry of Finance for Two Years

And Notify Central, China, and Communications Banks

After the Ministry of Finance announced the new currency system on November 3, 1935 (Republic of China Year 24), commercial banks and money shops were allowed to obtain legal currency from the Central, China, and Communications Banks with 40% securities and 60% cash. The purpose was to increase the liquidity of funds in the market and invigorate industry and commerce. A coupon contract was established, with a term of two years, expiring at the end of November this year. The Silver and Banking Trade Associations, considering that the circulation of coupons by member banks and shops has gradually invigorated industry and commerce and stabilized finance, especially during this extraordinary period, jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to request that the coupon contract be extended for two years, and sent a letter to the Central, China, and Communications Banks for reference.

### Wusong South Has Become a Marsh

Affected by Huangpu River High Tide

In recent days, there has been a sudden high tide in the Huangpu River. The area south of Wusong, along the Zhou Tang, is a low-lying area, so the area has become a marsh.

### Cold and Sunny Weather Yesterday After Shanghai's First Snowfall

Frozen Corpses on the Road Aided by Medical Relief

After the first snowfall in Shanghai the other day, the weather yesterday was sunny, but the cold was extreme and winter was perceived to have arrived. Ditches and water storage containers began to freeze with thin ice yesterday morning. The refugees wandering the streets, unable to withstand the cold, froze to death. Near 6th Malu Yunnan Road, the frozen corpse of a man was found. A child was frozen to death on the sidewalk of 4th Malu Shilu West, and the body was abandoned on the steps.

### Great World Shelter Introduces Refugees to Work

Since the establishment of the vocational guidance section at the Great World First Shelter in Shanghai, most of the refugees with skills have registered and been classified into more than thirty categories. Among them, workers in textiles, sewing, and rug hooking are the most numerous, and those who volunteer to serve as wet nurses and maids are also quite a few. Moreover, the shelter provides them with strict training, and their knowledge is relatively high. It is now heard that various manufacturers in Shanghai are striving to resume business to maintain the people's livelihood and stabilize society. The section is willing to take responsibility for introducing various skilled workers to be employed by various manufacturers. If various manufacturers and institutions (including local and foreign areas) need various employees, they can directly contact the vocational guidance section of the Great World First Shelter for employment, and the result will definitely satisfy the employers.

### Sudden Increase in Demand for Flour, Prices Soar Again and Again

4.40 Yuan Per Bag

Due to the recent shortage of rice in Shanghai, people's food has been greatly affected. Many people have switched to cooking with flour, causing the price of flour in Shanghai to skyrocket. The price rose from 4.05 yuan per bag to 4.15 yuan the other day, then to 4.25 yuan on the 23rd, and yesterday it rose to 4.40 yuan. Retailers are selling for as much as 4.60 yuan per bag. The price has risen by half a yuan in three days, more than one-third of the original price. It is said that there are 300,000 bags of flour in storage in Shanghai, so there will be no shortage.

### Pudong Vegetables Blocked from Transporting to Shanghai

After various parties intervened, the source of vegetables in Pudong poured in large quantities a few days ago, so the prices of vegetables such as cabbage and turnips plummeted, returning to normal prices. However, starting the other morning, the transport of vegetables across the river was blocked again at the Pudong ferry. The blockade continued yesterday morning. Although a small number of vegetable vendors came to Shanghai on small ships of foreign shipping companies through hidden paths, the number was very small, so the vegetables in the market have decreased again.

### Justifiable Homicide of a Chinese Detective at San Daotou

His Usual Conduct Was Extremely Reliable, Proven by the Chinese Detective Chief

Wang Jingting, Chinese Detective No. 2423 of the Lao Zha Police Station, because Wang Ruoshan, No. 1676 of San Daotou, repeatedly created difficulties for him and repeatedly reported to his superiors that the detective was derelict in his duties. Detective Wang repeatedly pleaded, but ultimately failed to obtain the forgiveness of No. 1676. Thereupon, he became overly angered, leading to a mental breakdown. On the morning of the 16th of this month at 7:00 AM, he suddenly used his service pistol to fire six shots at the aforementioned San Daotou, killing him. Detective Wang was also apprehended and sent to the Special No. 1 Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng opened court for further interrogation. According to Chinese Detective Chief Sun Maishan's testimony, the detective's usual conduct was excellent, and he was diligent in his studies of both Chinese and English. This time, he had a misunderstanding with the aforementioned No. 1676 San Daotou and had stated to me that I would explain to the aforementioned San Daotou and he had agreed not to report to his superiors. Why he suddenly reported to Chief Detective Liu Yaying later is unknown. When asked, Wang Jingting, No. 2423, stated that he had no prior animosity with the deceased. However, the deceased repeatedly created difficulties for him, and when Chief Detective Liu instructed him to prepare a report, he actually deleted the parts favorable to him and added all the unfavorable parts. He had pleaded bitterly, but was not allowed to change it. Because his superiors recently issued an order that anyone reported for dereliction of duty twice would be suspended from duty, he suffered a mental breakdown. He did not know what happened when he fired the shots. Following the mutual debate between the police station's lawyer, Li Zhishan, and the defendant's lawyer, Fan Gang, the court debate concluded, and the verdict was scheduled to be announced on the 27th.
