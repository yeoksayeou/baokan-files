### Chiang Submits Report on Xi'an Incident

[Nanjing] Chairman Chiang submitted a report to the Third Plenary Session on the Xi'an Incident, and attached a booklet of "Half a Month in Xi'an" compiled by hand. At the fourth general assembly of the plenary session on the afternoon of the 19th, a resolution was made on Chairman Chiang's report. The report and resolution are recorded separately as follows. (Chairman Chiang's Report) I respectfully report that, in December of last year, Zhongzheng was overseeing the military operations to suppress the bandits in the Northwest, which were expected to be completed in half a month to a month according to the planned schedule. I made a special trip from Luoyang to Shaanxi to personally supervise and urge the progress. Unexpectedly, Zhang Xueliang and others suddenly caused chaos, resulting in the Xi'an Incident on December 12. They launched an attack in Lintong and Xi'an simultaneously, using the name of "military remonstrance" but carrying out the reality of abduction. The central military and political officials in Shaanxi were also detained, disrupting discipline and shocking both domestic and international communities. Zhongzheng was excessively sincere and lacked foresight, only carrying a small number of guards, who all died resisting. At that time, in the chaos of the incident, I was cut off from contact with the outside world, and only resolved to sacrifice my life for righteousness, seeking to be worthy of my revolutionary duty. I also deeply believed that our central government would uphold the spirit of General Li's legacy and make appropriate decisions regarding suppressing the unrest and consolidating the foundation of the country. Later, thanks to the appropriate decision-making of the central authorities and the unity of the military and civilians throughout the country, justice was proclaimed, causing the instigators of the rebellion to repent and change their ways, and the incident was quelled. Zhongzheng returned to Nanjing on December 26, and Zhang Xueliang surrendered himself and wished to receive the punishment he deserved. The details of the incident should be reported in detail, but since December 12, although Zhongzheng has been generously tolerated by the central authorities and has not been condemned, my dereliction of duty has been so serious that I have already regarded myself as a criminal awaiting punishment and have not dared to report on the position of public office. I will only record the situation I experienced at the time on a daily basis and compile it into a booklet to answer the inquiries of my comrades. I respectfully submit it for your review. Upon investigation, the individuals involved in the Shaanxi Incident at that time issued a circular telegram, stating their so-called national affairs propositions, which aroused considerable attention from the outside world. On the day the incident occurred, Zhongzheng sternly reprimanded Zhang Xueliang, so he could not fully express what he wanted to say. It was not until the third day after the incident that I learned that he had eight propositions, namely: ㊀ Reorganize the Nanjing government and accommodate all parties and factions to take responsibility for saving the country; ㊁ Stop all civil wars; ㊂ Immediately release the patriotic leaders arrested in Shanghai; ㊃ Release all political prisoners in the country; ㊄ Guarantee the people's freedom of assembly and association; ㊅ Open up the patriotic movement of the masses; ㊆ Faithfully follow Sun Yat-sen's will; ㊇ Immediately convene a national salvation conference. Zhang Xueliang insisted that Zhongzheng allow them to implement these as their common propositions. Zhongzheng always ordered him to immediately repent and send Zhongzheng back to Nanjing. In addition, I did not want to listen to any statements, except to point out the absurdity of his actions and the meaninglessness of these propositions. I also lectured him that the party and the country have a definite organization and system, and even if there are opinions, they should be submitted to the central government for legal petition. Zhang asked to submit it to the central government after returning to Nanjing. Zhongzheng immediately explained that even if it could be submitted to the central government, I would declare that I did not approve of the propositions in the telegram. The details of this conversation are also detailed in the booklet, but this section is more important and must be specifically mentioned to draw the attention of all comrades present. Now that the plenary session is open, there must be definite instructions on the aftermath of the Northwest, and there must be a detailed review of national affairs. All choices of what to take and what to discard, and what is permissible and what is not, should be decided by the consensus of the public. Therefore, I have specifically described the process of Zhang Xueliang's presentation of the eight propositions to Zhongzheng, in order to provide reference. In addition to Zhongzheng's handwritten booklet, "Half a Month in Xi'an," which is submitted for your review and distribution to all comrades present, this is a special report. Respectfully submitted to the Third Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, Chiang Zhongzheng, March 18. (Resolution of the General Assembly) After the General Assembly accepted Comrade Chiang Zhongzheng's report on the Xi'an Incident and the booklet "Half a Month in Xi'an" compiled by him, it deeply recognized that the incident occurred suddenly at that time. Fortunately, Comrade Chiang was able to maintain an inviolable integrity and a fearless spirit in the face of extreme danger, causing the instigators of the rebellion to sincerely submit, be moved, and repent. Therefore, he was able to support the crisis, stabilize the situation, and quell the great unrest. The General Assembly expressed its deep admiration and comfort for his unwavering loyalty to the party and the country in the face of danger. The civil and military personnel who died in this incident for resisting and refusing to yield, or who risked their lives for righteousness, or who loyally resisted and died in their posts, all displayed a righteous spirit and are worthy of praise and lamentation. The General Assembly also expressed its admiration and condolences. As for the so-called eight propositions of the instigators of the rebellion, when they asked Comrade Chiang to submit them to the central government, Comrade Chiang resolutely declared his opposition with a solemn attitude. The General Assembly expressed its deep admiration and comfort. Regardless of its content, this proposition, since it was made through the behavior of rebellion and the method of coercion, is clearly a pretext for creating chaos and cannot be tolerated by national law and military discipline. The General Assembly is willing to ignore it in order to prevent imitation. However, our party adheres to the legacy of General Li's magnanimity and compassion, and the spirit of doing good to others. Those who are lost and know how to return, repent, and extricate themselves can generally be treated with sincerity and without any further investigation. We only hope that those who have repented this time can truly turn over a new leaf, thoroughly awaken, and pledge their loyalty to repay the party and the country. (Central News Agency telegram on the 19th)

### Request to Reiterate Resignation

[Nanjing] After Chairman Chiang returned to Nanjing from Xi'an, he repeatedly submitted requests to the Central Government to resign, but they were not approved. He has now submitted another request to the Third Plenary Session to reiterate his resignation in order to take responsibility for the Xi'an Incident. The Fourth General Assembly of the Plenary Session on the afternoon of the 19th unanimously resolved to reassure and retain him. Chairman Chiang's letter of resignation and the General Assembly's resolution to reassure and retain him are as follows:

### Original Text of Chiang's Resignation to the General Assembly

Respectfully submitted, since the Xi'an Incident last year, Zhongzheng has deeply grieved over the destruction of discipline and felt deeply guilty before the gods. In addition, due to accumulated fatigue and accumulated transgressions, I am unable to bear the burden. I have repeatedly submitted requests to the Central Government to be relieved of my various concurrent posts, but they were not approved. Instead, I was consoled and given a leave of absence to recuperate. Zhongzheng, feeling grateful for the Central Government's kindness, and knowing that the Plenary Session would be held soon, temporarily accepted the leave of absence and did not dare to continue to submit requests. Now, after spending over fifty days in the mountains reflecting on my faults, although the Central Government's authority has quelled the unrest, the people's hearts have been shaken for a long time, and the national vitality has been visibly damaged. Reflecting on the cause of the chaos, I am even more aware of the weight of my sins. If I had not lost my way in leading and guiding correctly, and had not been able to fully exercise my skills in appeasing, how could I have allowed subordinates who had been taught for many years to dare to commit such an act that endangers the foundation of the country? Zhongzheng, entrusted by the party and the country with important military and political responsibilities, cannot shirk my responsibility. Therefore, even though I have requested that the ringleaders be specially pardoned for their deserved crimes, I dare not evade my own immense transgressions. Since retreating to reflect on my errors, I have been filled with remorse at all times. I deeply believe that if I bear the responsibility for even one more day, I will not be able to find peace of mind for even one more day. For the party and the country, there is no way to demonstrate the strictness of rewards and punishments. For myself, I will only deepen the fear of falling into ruin. Now, on the occasion of the Plenary Session, I once again express my sincere feelings and earnestly request to be allowed to resign from all my posts as Vice-Chairman of the Central Standing Committee, Vice-Chairman of the Central Political Committee, President of the Executive Yuan, and Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, so that the laws and disciplines of the party and the country can be upheld and my original intention of taking responsibility can be fulfilled. I am filled with the urgency of awaiting orders. Respectfully submitted to the Third Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, Chiang Zhongzheng, February 18.

### General Assembly Resolves to Reassure and Retain Him

The General Assembly, upon reading Comrade Chiang Zhongzheng's letter, deeply considers that for more than ten years, Comrade Chiang has been in charge of the central government and commanded the troops, with outstanding sincerity and having endured great hardships. As for the Xi'an Incident, it was an extraordinary event. Comrade Chiang, upholding General Li's fearless spirit, was able to awe his subordinates and prevent the seeds of chaos. The manifestation of his great personality is unprecedented. At this time, when the country is in great difficulty and everything is waiting to be managed, it is hoped that Comrade Chiang will lead the masses, work hard to move forward, complete the unfinished work of the revolution, and comfort the hopes of the people. The party's future deeply relies on him. The request to resign from his various concurrent posts should not be considered. (Central News Agency telegram on the 19th)

### Chairman Chiang's Broadcast Speech Last Night

Elaborating on the Meaning of the New Life Movement; Hoping That the People of the Country Will Conscientiously Implement It

[Nanjing] The New Life Movement General Association will broadcast Chairman Chiang Zhongzheng's speech on the 3rd anniversary of the New Life Movement at the Central Broadcasting Station on the evening of the 19th. The full text is as follows:

Fellow compatriots, today is the third anniversary of the New Life Movement. I would like to take this opportunity to further explain a few important meanings of the New Life Movement to my fellow compatriots. First, we must understand the dire situation our country is in now, which is the so-called time of both internal and external troubles, one after another, and the national crisis is serious. If we do not want to sit idly by and wait for death, we must bear the responsibility of reviving the nation. The cause of reviving the nation is not the cause of an individual, nor is it the cause of a small number of groups, but the cause of every compatriot in the country. How can this cause of everyone succeed? Simply put, there are two elements: First, is to make the general public have national morality and his spirit. Second, is to make the general public have national knowledge and his skills. The higher the morality and the stronger the spirit of the people, the easier it is to make society progress. The broader the knowledge and the more sophisticated the skills of the people, the easier it is to improve life. Progress in society and improvement in life are the prerequisites for reviving the country and the nation. The promotion of the New Life Movement is to achieve this goal, to improve social customs, cultivate national vitality, and create the foundation for our survival and national revival. The meaning of the anniversary is originally to review the achievements of the past and to encourage future work. In the past two years, I have often gone to various provinces and cities to inspect, and I feel that in many places, there have been significant achievements in the two items of rules and cleanliness. As for improving the countryside, promoting domestic goods, paying attention to hygiene, and promoting frugality, there have also been considerable achievements. In addition, there was also the summer internship program for university students in rural areas, as well as the summer literacy schools automatically organized by university and middle school students in various places. Although it was a pioneering initiative, there were 66 university student representatives from universities in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Suzhou who used their summer vacation opportunities to participate in universal voluntary work in rural areas, improve the lives of farmers, and awaken farmers' awareness of the country and the nation. At the same time, students also gained a lot of experience in serving society and familiarized themselves with the actual lives of farmers, which is indeed a win-win situation. This is very gratifying. However, we cannot be satisfied with this. The promotion of our New Life Movement cannot achieve the intended goals. Therefore, I would like to contribute the following points to the comrades who are promoting the New Life Movement. (To be continued) (Central News Agency telegram on the 19th)

Psychologically, it is manifested as the enhancement of the national concept of the national people and helping the government to pacify the country and resist foreign aggression. In action, it is manifested in the fact that the general social life habits of the Chinese people have gradually embarked on a bright future. The more remarkable achievements of the New Life Movement in the capital are labor service, health movement, thrift movement, rectification of the city appearance, and new life education. To commemorate the New Life Movement, we should implement this movement and must be more sincere and united to support the leader." Subsequently, Qian Dajun reported on the work of the New Life Movement General Association in the past year, and then Kong Xiangxi, Zhang Ji, Deng Jiayan and others delivered speeches one after another, all of which were extremely pertinent.

### Extracurricular Notes from the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee

— Qian Hua, Reporter of This Newspaper

Since the opening of the Third Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee in the capital on the 15th, it has been in session for five days, and most of the important proposals have been settled. The closing declaration is now being drafted with great solemnity to make a general conclusion. The declaration drafting committee met once on the 18th to conduct a thorough discussion of the declaration and decided that Wang Jingwei would preside over the drafting of the declaration. This conference was convened after the victory of the suppression war and the resolution of the Xi'an Incident. How to gradually repair our broken rivers and mountains to achieve the goal of restoring our integrity? Regarding the aftermath of the Shaanxi Incident and other internal issues, how can we make the national will unified and gather the national strength and people's strength to bury ourselves in the work of saving the country and preserving our existence? On these issues, the Central Committee is indeed bearing a very serious responsibility. Now that they are gathered together to decide the future domestic and foreign policies, the expectations of the people of the country are self-evident.

During the conference, the reporter visited the capital for several days. From the surface, the conference did not have any tense atmosphere, which is obviously a manifestation of the national calmness. However, the bosses of major hotels smiled and all the hotels were full. Some of the Central Committee members lived in the Capital Hotel, some lived in the Central Hotel, and the rest were scattered in the official residences, Beijing offices, and overseas Chinese reception centers. During the meeting, the hotel was as quiet as usual, but after the meeting, from 4:00 or 5:00 PM until the evening, countless streamlined cars were lined up outside the hotel, and the corridors inside were crowded with guests who came to visit, which was very lively. Usually, small rooms in the hotel are easy to sell, and large rooms are always empty, but this time it was the opposite. The more luxurious rooms were already full. Some Central Committee members led a lot of adjutants and guards, so they usually opened two rooms, and those with more attendants opened three rooms. He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, opened six large rooms, and a row of "He" characters on the passenger board was very beautiful. As far as the members attending this meeting are concerned, it is more enthusiastic than any previous session, which symbolizes the national unity and the spirit of resisting foreign aggression. Although the military and political figures that the whole country is watching, such as Yan Xishan, Song Zheyuan, Gan Fuju, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Liu Xiang, etc., are sick or have something to do, and asked the conference for leave and could not attend in person, which is unavoidable, but they all sent very important plenipotentiary representatives to contact outside the meeting, which is not much different from attending in person.

Now it is time to talk about the news industry itself. This conference was more strict about news control than any previous session. When the conference was in session, a special security line was set up near the Central Party Headquarters. The first step was to obtain a special vehicle pass, otherwise, you could not cross the Leichi line. The second step was to need a special badge to enter the venue, otherwise, you could only sigh at the door, and even the staff of the Central Party Headquarters had to follow the rules. And news reporters do not have the right to obtain such passes and badges. So, there is absolutely no trace of news reporters inside or outside the venue. In the past, although news reporters could not attend the meeting as observers, there was a reporter reception room outside, and they could still meet with the members when the meeting adjourned and took photos. Since the assassination of Mr. Wang two years ago, there has been a deep invisible separation between reporters and dignitaries. Of course, this conference is no exception. The conference news is prepared by the secretariat and handed over to the Central News Agency for publication. On the one hand, it does save a lot of manpower and financial resources for the newspapers, but many newspapers still sent people here and had to find a few attending members after the meeting to get a little bit of news. A certain member said to the reporter with a smile that the news industry always holds the concept of recording everything they hear, but this is actually wrong. After asking, you have to distinguish right from wrong, choose, and then publish it. Sometimes, a person in the venue is excited and makes a speech. If the newspaper writes it down and records it, things may grow from small to large. If you don't write a word, small things can become nothing. So, sometimes it is better to publish less news. You can save trouble, and the government can save trouble too. This kind of philosophy of doing nothing is one end of our country's native culture, and peace and reconciliation all start from this point, which is indeed a great truth.

### Wu Siyu Temporarily Replaces Director of the Military Affairs Commission Office

The Issue of Zhu Peide's State Funeral Will Be Submitted to the Standing Committee of the Military Affairs Commission for Discussion

[Nanjing] After Zhu Peide's death, the position of Director of the Military Affairs Commission Office that he left behind is now temporarily replaced by Wu Siyu, Deputy Director of the Office, by order of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. It is widely believed that the issue of Zhu's state funeral will be submitted to the Standing Committee of the Military Affairs Commission for discussion this week. In addition, Li Du, a veteran of the Northeast Army, had a very deep personal friendship with Zhu. Hearing the bad news of Zhu's death, he was extremely saddened and has telegraphed his representative in Beijing, Liu Buguang, to go to Zhu's spiritual altar to express condolences and to send a telegram to his family.

It was also decided that the coffin would be moved to the Piro Temple at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 21st, and the date of the memorial service would be determined after the coffin was moved. In addition, on the 19th, those who came to the hall to express condolences were still very enthusiastic. The chief mourner, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, also visited the hall in person at about 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 19th and inquired about the preparations for the coffining from Huang Shi, a member of the funeral committee. He left the hall after half an hour. After Zhu's body was injected, dressed, and moved to the preparation room, it was covered with the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Party Emblem of the Kuomintang. The chanting group invited lamas and senior monks to chant sutras beside him. It is reported that all the Central Committee members in Beijing will participate in the coffining on the 20th.

### Britain Increases Defense of Hong Kong

— Hua

According to recent reports from Reuters, the British government has recently paid great attention to the defense of Hong Kong. From November to December last year, there was a long-term exercise in the sea, land, and air in Hong Kong. According to reports from London, the cost of building new barracks in Hong Kong reached a huge amount of 1.1 million pounds. On the 18th of this month, a Hong Kong telegram also reported that the British authorities had designated two square miles of Stanley Peninsula in southern Hong Kong as a military zone and built secret fortresses. According to the 16th telegram, the largest-scale defense exercise will be held in Hong Kong in the middle of next month, with the participation of the army, navy, and air force, including 2,500 soldiers, the entire fleet of the Chinese waters with 25 ships, 1,000 soldiers from Singapore, and one squadron of flying boats. There are also island air defense forces and the newly established naval volunteer team. Not long ago, the British army had a large-scale exercise in Singapore. Now Hong Kong is also showing the same military activities. What is the significance of this in the development of the situation in the Far East?

Hong Kong and Singapore are both important British military bases in the Far East. In terms of their original status, Hong Kong's importance is actually greater than Singapore's. However, due to the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922, which stipulated that Hong Kong was within the scope of non-fortification, Britain took Singapore as the military center of the Far East. But at the end of last year, the Washington Treaty was abolished and invalidated by Japan's statement. The Pacific's non-fortification regulations were also canceled. So, in the turbulent waves of the Pacific, Britain began to extend its maritime military activities from Singapore to Hong Kong again.

Britain's active increase in the defense of Hong Kong is mainly due to three motives. First, the gradual advancement of Japan's economic power into the South Pacific. Now, Britain's markets in Hong Kong, Malaya, and India have been almost entirely taken away by Japan. This situation has caused great threats to the capitalists of Lancashire. The competition for the market is easy to develop into the competition for territory. Therefore, the British colonial authorities have to prepare for defense as soon as possible. The first is the southward advance of Japan's military power, which has now become increasingly clear. The development of Taiwan's naval and air ports, the secret military construction of the South Pacific mandated group of islands, the conspiracy to obtain the right to excavate the Siamese Canal, and Japan's coveting of our Hainan Island are all sufficient to arouse the fears of the British military authorities. Therefore, the strengthening of Hong Kong's defense this time is also very significant in the struggle between the two major powers of Britain and Japan. The third is that the development of the entire Far Eastern situation has aroused Britain's active attention. In 1936, the British diplomatic authorities had explored Japan's views on the Far East compromise several times, but all ended in failure. And the establishment of the Japan-Germany alliance at the end of November gave a serious blow to Britain's position in the Far East. Due to this vast international diplomatic impetus, Britain's policy towards the Far East seems to have gradually changed. Especially in its relations with China, the United States, and the Soviet Union, Britain has somewhat abandoned the narrow attitude of the "die-hard" conservatives of the past and adopted a friendly and cooperative policy. The advancement of this policy will naturally make Hong Kong's status gradually increase in importance. Since the completion of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway last year, the longest railway communication line in the world from Hong Kong to England has almost been formed. And Pan American Company's trans-Pacific air route will also directly reach Hong Kong on the 24th of next month, connecting with China National Aviation Corporation's route. All of this is enough to show the importance of Hong Kong in future Far Eastern transportation and international cooperation. We hope that the British authorities can promote the collective security link on the Pacific Ocean based on this policy change and jointly oppose the greatest aggressor.

### British House of Commons Approves National Defense Loan Bill

Prime Minister Defends Policy Forcefully; Strengthen Military to Prevent Aggression; League of Nations Mechanism to Create Peace

[London] The British government's plan to issue a national defense loan of 400 million pounds was debated in the House of Commons today. Despite opposition from the Labour and Liberal parties, it ultimately passed by a large majority of 329 votes to 145. This occurred after Prime Minister Baldwin made a vigorous defense of the government's policy, after which the vote began. Prior to this, both the Labour Party and the opposition Liberal Party had indicated they would vote against it.

In his debate speech, Baldwin stated that the sole purpose of this expenditure was to enable the nation's strength to reach a standard that could guarantee the safety of Great Britain and the Empire, "so that it can contribute its modest efforts to the maintenance of world peace." Baldwin further stated that the nation's financial strength was fully capable of implementing this plan without endangering social undertakings or causing excessive price fluctuations that would affect the people's standard of living. Baldwin reiterated Foreign Secretary Eden's statement that Britain's military power would never be used for aggression, but only for the defense of the Empire and those who are invaded. All parties now aim to maintain peace, and the government has previously exerted its utmost efforts to create peace within the framework of the League of Nations. If it unfortunately fails, the government certainly cannot accept failure as the final outcome. However, the government has not yet abandoned its hope and aim for peace. What it is currently striving for is to conclude a new agreement with the countries of the former Locarno Treaty to replace the old Locarno Treaty.

According to Baldwin's opinion, the greatest hope in the near future lies in the conclusion of regional agreements. Baldwin continued that the greatest cause of unrest in Europe in the past two or three years has been the imbalance between Britain's burden and responsibilities and its lack of strength. That is, in collective security, if one wants to contribute even modestly, one must first have the ability to maintain oneself. Baldwin firmly believes that if a mutual assistance treaty can be established in Western Europe, peace can be maintained; otherwise, once it breaks down, "what will be before us will be European military and air combat countries of the first rank." Moreover, Britain also has territories in the East. On the one hand, Britain should have the ability to take care of itself at sea, but if unfortunately things exceed this scope, Britain must also have the ability to take care of itself. If Britain does not actively cooperate with other countries or have the ability to take care of itself, then joining collective security is a very dangerous thing. Therefore, the government's proposal today is to avoid this danger. "What we are discussing tonight concerns our security and the safety of our people," he said.

Questions from the Opposition

The first speaker in the opposition's debate was former First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander. The main points of his speech were as follows: ㊀ The reason why the military expansion program is needed is because the government has missed many opportunities in the scope of its diplomatic policy in the past few years. ㊁ The government has not provided evidence that it has obtained the legitimate value of the funding it intends to request from Congress. ㊂ The method of raising debt to finance this expenditure goes against the path of stable finances, which is the weapon used by the political opposition to resist the 1931 MacDonald government.

Inskip's Reply

Next, Minister for Coordination of Defence, Sir Thomas Inskip, rose and stated that he had not seen any speaker ask about any item of the armaments program contained in the White Paper on Tuesday. Inskip also answered Alexander's question, saying that when the budget is submitted to the House of Commons, the House will naturally have ample opportunity to protect the economy.

Government Foreign Policy

Regarding foreign policy, Inskip quoted Foreign Secretary Eden's speech on January 19, saying, "The government is now actively engaged in the reorganization and rearmament of military affairs. We deeply feel that this move is something we cannot avoid in order to achieve our goals. However, this move itself is not our goal. What remains is to negotiate a solution for Europe and consolidate the authority of the League of Nations. We are prepared to cooperate with the powers in the joint work of political appeasement and economic cooperation."

Four Military Plans

Inskip then mentioned that during Wednesday's debate in the House of Commons, he criticized the government's program for lacking genuine coordination, citing the four plans that had been agreed upon as evidence. The Navy, Army, and Air Force are cooperating in these four plans. He hoped that this would alleviate public concern about this matter. ㊀ The coastal defense problem has been thoroughly studied, focusing on the vulnerability of each port to attacks from the sea or the air. The actual defense measures required for each port in modern conditions have been specified, and the allocation of various weapons has been discussed with local authorities. ㊁ The national air defense problem has been studied in detail not only by experts from the Navy, Army, and Air Force, but also by experts from relevant departments, to reach the precise level of protection that needs to be given to each specific location. As a result of this study, the total amount and nature of the defense expenditure have been determined, so that the expenditure mentioned in the White Paper can be based on precise planning. ㊂ The accumulation of munitions. ㊃ The potential of industry.

Lessons Learned from Incidents

Inskip continued that the House of Commons was probably not aware that the government had conducted a thorough investigation into the ability of various factories to manufacture weapons and ammunition. For example, the government discovered that there were shortcomings in certain needs of the Army, and immediately set about remedying them. In the Tyne and Wear region, it is engaged in mechanical engineering to ensure that production capacity can meet any emergency needs. As for higher strategic matters, Inskip was pleased to reiterate the experience and intelligence gained by experts from the Navy, Army, and Air Force, whether they were operating on their own or under the Committee of Imperial Defence. He also mentioned that attention had been paid to the lessons learned from the incidents in the Eastern and Western Mediterranean last year. Inskip also cited several important issues that his department had organized and cooperated in studying, namely the import of food, the transformation of wartime transportation, the organization of transportation in ports and inland, the distribution of wartime rations, the storage of food, and the storage of raw materials.

Regarding the storage of raw materials, Inskip said that the government had acted in a timely manner and had planned to store as much as possible of the important materials needed for the manufacture of armaments. Inskip continued, "You cannot measure security in small ways. Any government worthy of the name must ultimately make it its duty to ensure that no foreign country can subdue us. Britain's inviolable credit is its priceless treasure," he said.

Relationship with the Dominions

Inskip did not agree with the opposition party's criticism of the policies of the Dominion governments. He said, "When the Imperial Conference is convened this year, we will have ample opportunity to consult with the representatives of the governments of the various Dominions. At that time, the policies of the Dominion governments should be presented by their representatives. We cannot force them to be bound by our constraints." As for the opposition party's claim that Great Britain is paying the price for the defense of the Dominions, Inskip said, "The reason why we must have the government pay for the defense costs of certain colonies and dependencies in the Empire is because these places are within our sphere of responsibility and because we rely on these places as sources of raw materials. Moreover, the Dominions also realize the value of their connection with Great Britain. For their own safety, they are using their own money to prepare themselves," he said.

Labour Party Speakers Again

After Sir Thomas Inskip finished speaking, Labour MP Wedgwood took the floor. Wedgwood said that if Britain faces any danger, the danger must come from Germany. Therefore, "we must consider the need for an alliance with France and Russia." Wedgwood further said that in the Spanish war, Britain should send people to both sides to inspect the latest lack of progress in the war and avoid wasting military expenditure. Wedgwood said that the reason why the Labour Party opposes this military expenditure is not because the party is unwilling to fulfill its responsibility to protect the nation, democracy, and the working class around the world, but because it still has doubts about whether this kind of tool can achieve peace. Labour MP Cripps continued that he acknowledged the need for armaments because the Labour Party currently recognizes the National Socialist Party as the primary public enemy. However, if the British people want to obtain a guarantee against National Socialism, they must first grant the Labour government the power to manage foreign policy and military force. Labour MP Montagu then indicated that the opposition Labour Party would vote against the National Defense Loan Bill. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters)

### Britain Expands Navy, US Generals Hasten to Catch Up

Believe it is Necessary to Adopt New Procedures; Japan Pays Great Attention to Actions of Britain and America

[Washington] Senator Walsh, Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee, declared today that if the British Navy continues to expand, the United States will need to adopt new naval procedures. Walsh also requested that close attention be paid to the naval movements of Britain and other powers. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)

[Washington] Britain's new naval plan, which plans to increase the number of capital ships by three and cruisers by seven, according to the remarks made by US Undersecretary of the Navy Edison after his meeting with President Roosevelt today, will not have an unfavorable impact on the United States. Edison also stated that the counterattack on the American side in this matter is two-pronged. On the one hand, Britain's purchase of new materials from the United States will naturally bring considerable benefits to American commerce. However, the United States' own naval construction plan is currently stalled due to a shortage of steel and copper materials, and this situation is likely to be further impacted. According to Edison, if the current dispute between the government and the steel industry cannot be resolved soon, some shipyard workers will be laid off in March of this year. This is because the American steel industry, in opposition to the implementation of the Healy-Snyder Act, which mandates a 40-hour work week, has adopted the strategy of refusing to supply each department with the steel materials needed for shipbuilding as a form of resistance. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)

[Washington] The Senate Naval Affairs Committee today passed a bill prohibiting idlers from taking photographs or making surveys of naval and military fortresses. (18th, National News)

[Tokyo] The Japanese Foreign Ministry believes that Britain's plan to expand its military will incite European and American countries to expand their armaments and will have a significant impact on Japan. According to the Foreign Ministry's opinion, the British government's inclusion of a five-year military plan in the budget this time is completely different from the previous form of the budget. It seems to be a plan based on the anticipation of a major crisis within three or four years. The goal of this plan is to expand the Air Force and the Navy. As far as the Navy is concerned, the British government plans to build three capital ships, seven cruisers, and two aircraft carriers in 1937 and 1938. The United States has always advocated equality with Britain, so it is obvious that it will actively build warships to counter Britain. From this point of view, Britain's naval expansion will not only promote the strengthening of the US Pacific Fleet, but if its capital ships come to the Far East to strengthen the defenses of Singapore, it will have a major impact on East Asia. Japan cannot but pay attention to the future of Britain's plan. (19th, Domei News)

[Rome] It has recently been learned that Turkey will soon order several warships from Italian naval shipyards, and will supply Italy with high-quality coal from the Erigli mining area on the Black Sea coast to offset the cost of the warships. This arrangement was reportedly agreed upon during the talks held by Foreign Minister Rüştü Aras and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Milan. (18th, Havas)

### Japanese Army Minister Explains Reasons for Military Expansion

Parliament Will Accept Budget; Finance Minister Plans to Transport Cash

[Tokyo] The House of Representatives Budget Committee held a closed-door meeting today. Army Minister Sugiyama Gen presented a special map of the military situation in eastern Siberia and North China to explain the necessity of expanding Japan's military preparations. Based on the map and statistics, he provided detailed examples of the Soviet Union's military preparations in the Far East and the transportation capacity of the Siberian double-track railway. At the meeting, Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa also explained the reasons why Japan must expand its naval power and gave a detailed explanation of the naval construction situation in the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. There is great concern here about Britain's recent announcement of a five-year plan to increase military preparations by 1.5 billion pounds. The goal of this plan is to compete with the total strength of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and to increase Britain's naval strength in the Far East. (Central News Agency, 19th)

[Tokyo] The various political parties in the Diet, in the current environment, may have no choice but to accept the revised budget for the next fiscal year proposed by the Hayashi Cabinet. Its characteristic is the issuance of public bonds to reduce the amount of the shortfall. The budget drafted by the former Finance Minister Baba had a shortfall of 802,400,000 yuan. The current Finance Minister Yūki has reduced this number to 725,400,000 yuan. The revised budget requires a total of 2,769,400,000 yuan, a reduction of 269,100,000 yuan compared to what Baba had proposed. The largest item of austerity is the 220,000,000 yuan that the Hirota Cabinet planned to allocate to the governments of various counties to reorganize their finances. Now, 150,000,000 yuan has been cut. Other austerity items total 19,100,000 yuan. This is because various undertakings planned for implementation have been delayed by one year, of which the Army and Navy account for 23,000,000 yuan. Before the revision of the budget, ordinary taxes were estimated at 2,236,100,000 yuan. Because Yūki's draft estimate changes the tax rate, this item is only 2,044,000,000 yuan. There is no doubt that the actual amount of the budgetary cuts is only 120,000,000 yuan and will be criticized, because the cut in the delayed implementation of the reorganization of county finances is merely empty talk on paper. However, farmers will certainly have many complaints about the delay. In short, the heavy burden of Japan's Army and Navy expenses has now been strengthened. The Finance Minister's revised plan to increase taxes to cover a portion of the government's increased expenses has abandoned the plan of the previous Finance Minister to increase several new taxes that would hit capitalists. This is quite commendable. Today, the financial community is satisfied with the budget, so the investment market has become firm. The business community is quite dissatisfied because the government levies heavy taxes on them, which they regard as contrary to the government's policy of promoting the expansion of Japan's productive capacity. The Farmers' Committee wrote that the new budget takes more from the farmers than it gives and ignores the plight of many rural areas. The Army wishes to state that the reduction of Army expenses in the next fiscal year (23,000,000 yuan) does not mean the cancellation of what the Hirota Cabinet had promised to give, but only because of technical difficulties, what cannot be used this year will be delayed until next year. (Central News Agency, 19th)

[Tokyo] In a response to Nakano Seigō's question in the House of Representatives on the 18th, Finance Minister Yūki stated that if necessary in terms of exchange policy, cash transportation can be implemented. This measure will not have a harmful impact on Japan's gold reserves. Finance Minister Yūki acknowledged that the exchange market has stabilized since the government announced the exchange control order, but because the Yokohama Specie Bank holds a meager amount of foreign loans, for future exchange policy, it has been decided to use the method of transporting cash to promote the development of trade through close contact between the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Bank of Japan. As for the timing and method of cash transportation, the Finance Minister intends to entrust the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Bank of Japan to decide.

Bank of Japan Governor Ikeda Seihin, regarding the issue of cash transportation, issued a statement saying that Finance Minister Yūki's response can be interpreted as preventing exchange rates from falling. If necessary, the government will not hesitate to implement cash transportation. The time for its implementation will be when the current system of import exchange permits cannot be maintained. After the implementation of cash transportation, the import exchange permit system will still be difficult to abolish. Currently, the amount of foreign currency held by the Yokohama Specie Bank has decreased slightly, so in order to maintain the benchmark exchange rate of one shilling and two pence, the Bank of Japan must transport the legal tender it holds abroad. In that case, the Bank of Japan must start by transporting new gold production, and on the Bank of Japan's side, because it has a position of encouraging gold production or alleviating private cash smuggling, it may also increase the gold purchase price.

### Internal Struggles Between Political and Civil Parties

Possibility of Disintegration

[Tokyo] As the Japanese House of Representatives begins to examine various bills today, concrete issues are being discussed. The Budget Committee meets every day in the morning to examine the budget, and heated debates are inevitable. However, the public is not allowed to attend, so the content is unknown. The trend of this session of the Diet has been determined, and serious disturbances are unlikely to occur. What is currently worthy of our special attention is the possible developments after the Diet adjourns and the concrete diplomatic policies adopted by the Hayashi Cabinet. Due to the resignation of President Suzuki of the Seiyūkai, fierce struggles between the various factions within the party are already in progress, causing the party's disintegration to come sooner and facilitating the emergence of new parties. Although the situation in the Minseitō is not serious, the clamor for reorganization is also high. In the future, after the Seiyūkai collapses, the Minseitō may also disintegrate. Therefore, the liberalists and protectors of the Minseitō and Seiyūkai and those who advocate controlism will all seek their own way out. As a result, two major opposing camps will be formed. The most difficult problem to solve will be the selection of the leaders of these parties. Currently, there is a shortage of leading figures in the two major camps. Without suitable leaders, the development of the new movement will be delayed. In the future, the most promising leaders of the Minseitō and Seiyūkai are undoubtedly Ugaki Kazushige and Konoe Fumimaro, but it is extremely questionable whether Ugaki and Konoe believe that the time is ripe and whether they can truly bear this great burden. Also, the Hayashi Cabinet's foreign policy is based on the principle of coordination. This was made even clearer when Hayashi answered Nakano's questions yesterday. As for the concrete plan for policy towards China, it may not be established until after the Diet adjourns. It is still difficult to predict whether the Hayashi Cabinet will seek a full-time Foreign Minister, because it is widely believed that Hayashi's concurrent position as Foreign Minister can facilitate the implementation of his policies.

### Japan Absorbing Manchurian Funds

Osaka Tomita, president of the Manchurian Industrial Development Bank, attended a懇談会 sponsored by the Japan-Manchuria Industrial Association on the 18th and stated that the Manchurian Industrial Development Bank's operating policy must strive to absorb the deposits of the Manchurian banks. However, because "Manchurians" are unwilling to deposit, they have no choice but to absorb funds by issuing special bonds. Manchuria's nine-year economic plan requires 300 million yuan in funding. The funds transferred from Japan to Manchuria have traditionally been 250 million yuan per year. If it can be increased by 100 million yuan, then it will be sufficient. (19th, Domei News)

### Spanish Rebels Reinforce South of Capital, Launch Major Counteroffensive

Government Forces Resist Vigorously but Fail to Succeed; Aerial Battle Occurs in Madrid

Madrid Special dispatch from our reporter: Yesterday, the Nationalist Army had 10,000 fresh troops arrive from the cities of Seville in the south and Badajoz in the west, southeast of the capital. Most of them were Germans. At about 3:00 PM, they joined forces with the original garrison and launched a counteroffensive against the government army's positions in the town of Maranoza near the Jarama River. The fierce battle lasted for three hours. At the same time, twenty-one Nationalist Army bombers, escorted by several fighter planes, dropped bombs to assist in the battle in the sky above the battlefield. Several government army planes immediately took off to engage them, shooting down seven Nationalist Army planes. Four government army planes were also shot down. As a result, the government army's line of defense remained unyielding because the hand grenade squads fought to the death. The Nationalist Army ultimately failed to succeed. (19th, Havas)

Avila According to a statement released by the Spanish Nationalist Army, the government army and the Nationalist Army's planes engaged in two air battles in the skies over Madrid yesterday. The first battle involved a total of forty fighter planes, about two and a half miles from the ground. A total of nine government army planes were shot down and crashed, and another plane was shot down in the afternoon battle. In addition, when Nationalist Army planes attacked the Tituynia airfield, they destroyed five government army planes. No Nationalist Army planes were lost. Cuenca, which is now gradually becoming an important base for the government army's rear defense line, was also bombed by a Nationalist Army plane. Only one government army plane was lost. It also claimed that the government army had attacked the fortified positions held by German soldiers in the Malaherida-Tajuña area. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters)

### Spanish Rebels Join Anti-Comintern Pact

Conspiring With Germany and Japan

[Paris] 事業報 The diplomatic reporter, Madame Tabouis, recently declared that the leader of the Spanish Nationalist Army government, General Franco, has concluded an agreement with Germany stipulating that General Franco will join the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany and Japan (established on November 26 of last year) so that each country will provide mutual assistance in the event of a conflict with the Third International. In exchange, Germany will allocate 1,500 members of the National Socialist Party's Brownshirts to General Franco to form a special police force. In addition, General Franco has promised that once he wins the civil war, he will declare his withdrawal from the League of Nations on the grounds that the League of Nations should not support the republican government of Valencia.

### Recent Situation in Xi'an After the Shaanxi Incident

Rumors of Xi'an Becoming a Realm of Terror are False; Gu Zhutong is Responsible for Handling All Aftermath

Xi'an Special Dispatch: Since the Shaanxi Incident occurred, dragging on for two months without resolution, various parties have become increasingly suspicious. While rumors may be unavoidable, this reporter, in order to understand the truth, left Pingyang the day after Guangyuan and came to Shaanxi, arriving in Xi'an after two days and nights. I saw firecrackers exploding and drums beating incessantly in the city of Chang'an, shops closed for business, and tourists bustling about, filled with the strong atmosphere of celebrating the Spring Festival. The citizens' enthusiastic display of celebrating the lunar new year was the same as in other places. The rumor that Xi'an had become a realm of terror was proven false. The Northwest aftermath is entirely under the responsibility of Gu Zhutong, the head of the Administrative Office. Gu follows the Central government's peaceful policy and generous attitude, using political means to handle everything. Upon arriving in Xi'an, he immediately convened senior cadres of the Central Army and senior personnel of various agencies for a speech, stating that the Xi'an Incident had come to an end. There is no need to criticize the past, but individuals should reflect on past mistakes, correct past arrogant attitudes, adjust emotions, and unite in spirit to walk the path of saving the country and the people. After the February 2nd Incident was pacified, the Northeast generals, after expelling the few radical instigators such as Sun Mingjiu, Miao Jianqiu, and Ying De, all recognized the national crisis and should support unity, peace, and national salvation. The person in charge is Yu Xuezhong, the chairman of Gansu Province. Yu is known for his overall awareness and indifference to personal gain. He has a deep sense of national and ethnic identity. He received a handwritten note from Zhang Xueliang when he escorted Chairman Chiang to fly to Beijing, ordering him to command the Northeast armies. During the February 2nd Incident, Sun Mingjiu and others used violence to force him to issue orders for resistance against Japan. Wang Yizhe died for this. Wang never succumbed to their pressure. His desire for peace and support for unity can be imagined. He Zhuguo went south to meet Chairman Chiang a few days ago and flew to Fenghua yesterday to meet Zhang, reporting on the situation in Xi'an and requesting instructions on how to handle the aftermath. He will return to Shaanxi in the coming days to convey the central government's intentions. The details of the negotiations and the conditions of each party may not be disclosed in advance because the timing is too early or because they involve military secrets. After He Zhuguo returns to Shaanxi in the coming days, a peaceful resolution can be expected to take shape. This reporter left Pingyang on the night of the twelfth, arrived in Zhengzhou on the thirteenth, went west that night, and arrived in Xi'an on the evening of the fourteenth. The scenery along the Pinghan and Longhai Railways was completely different. I will briefly describe a few aspects for the readers. The common scene along the Pinghan Railway from Shenyang to Zhengzhou was that each station was decorated with firecrackers to celebrate the New Year. From time to time, I saw mule carts full of men and women dressed in red and green heading to relatives and friends to wish them well in the old year. Even today, in the 26th year of the Republic of China, the abolition of the lunar calendar has not been fully implemented. It can be seen that old habits are hard to break. The white snow along the way gave a sense of a bountiful year. The scenery seen along this route was entirely peaceful. The scenery along the Longhai Railway from Zhengzhou to Xi'an was completely different. What I saw at each station were crowded troop trains, fully armed troops, rows of tanks and weapons, centralized railway locomotives, destroyed railway bridges, and remaining trenches. The Weinan station was the most severely damaged. The station building and warehouses had their roofs blown off, the railway bridge was destroyed and lay across the riverbed, and more than ten miles of railways were destroyed. The rails were cut into pieces, the sleepers were lost, and barbed wire and electric fences were scattered along the road. On the platform of Chishui Station, the wooden sign indicating the station name only had the character "赤" (chì, red) remaining. The place where the character "水" (shuǐ, water) was written had a bullet hole. The people along the road were busy filling in the trenches, hoping that after the civil war ended, they could cultivate the spring fields to maintain their lives. On this road, cruelty and the ferocity of the god of war were revealed everywhere, and the feeling became two different worlds. Fortunately, the central government is broad-minded and sincere. The generals regretted the war and supported unity, turning hostility into friendship. It is the good fortune of the country and the blessing of the people. (16th)

### Kwantung Army of Japan Implements Military Training for Northeast Youth

Initial Stage: 15,000 People Aged 16-19; To Be Driven to the Front Lines as Cannon Fodder When the Far East War Occurs

Changchun Correspondence: In order to permanently consolidate its illegally seized Northeast, the Japanese Kwantung Army has adopted measures beyond using force to ensure both external and internal suppression of resistance. They have also created various novel systems to create an inseparable relationship between the people of the Northeast and themselves, such as promoting the 麻醉 (mázui, anesthesia) policy of harmony and friendship between Japan and the puppet regime, and actively promoting enslavement education. More recently, they have implemented military training for Northeast youth. The intention is that when the Far East War occurs in the future, the trained youth will be driven to the front lines as cannon fodder. Currently, there are 49 locations throughout the Northeast where youth military training centers are established. The initial intake capacity is 15,000 people. The training method is divided into five terms per year, each term lasting two months. During this time, they must study Japanese spiritual civic courses and coaching courses. The civic course is further divided into five parts: the spirit of Japan-Manchukuo harmony, legal system, welfare, industry, and Japanese language. The coaching subjects and curriculum focus on coaching and physical exercise. The basic conditions for the youth admitted are that they must be between 16 and 19 years old and physically strong. After the training is completed, if there is no war externally, they will be sent back to their hometowns to serve as instructors in rural areas, so as to achieve the excellent result of farmers obeying the Japanese spirit and completely eliminate the roots of anti-Manchukuo and anti-Japanese resistance. All instructors in the training centers are filled by members of the Japanese Harmony Society, who must be between 25 and 35 years old. The training of these instructors will be completed within the Harmony Society from the 20th of this month to the end of the same month. As for the textbooks used in the training centers, according to the true information leaked by the Japanese, they are currently being compiled by authorities on military education within the Kwantung Army. Generally, they can be completed by the end of this month and printed around the 20th of next month.

### Songjiang

Mechanic Killed in Car Accident

Zhang Jiarui, a sock repair mechanic from Taihe Sock Factory in Gaojiayan, this city, is from Pudong, 29 years old. He arrived in Songjiang yesterday and started working at the factory. Unexpectedly, today, during work, he suddenly felt like going out for fun and hired a bicycle to stroll along the Songhui Road. Traveling from west to east, a car driving from Sijing to Songjiang in the afternoon at 1 PM encountered him head-on at Shajia Bridge. Zhang's bicycle should have yielded to the right, but in a moment of confusion, he yielded to the left and collided with the car with a loud bang. The person fell to the ground. The car driver, Yin Jiangguan, was unable to brake in time and ran over Zhang Jiarui's head and right hand. His skull was crushed and his brains gushed out. He died instantly. The city police substation has detained the car driver and notified the factory. On the one hand, they reported to the local court and sent a prosecutor to the scene for inspection. It was determined that the deceased did not understand the method of yielding to traffic and tragically met his end. The factory has claimed the body for burial and notified the deceased's family.

### Changshu

Sudden Incident of Water and Land Guards in Tangshi

The town of Tangshi in this county has a long-standing gambling problem, which is especially rampant during the Lunar New Year. Because of the location being a water area, it is difficult for land police to make arrests. The authorities had previously informed various teahouses and written agreements to refrain from gathering for gambling. However, the general gamblers seized the opportunity to gather near the water area. Since they were beyond the reach of the land police and the water police could not go ashore to make arrests, they have been at peace for ten days. However, the water and land police have become suspicious of each other, each suspecting the other of protecting the gamblers. Trouble-makers have also been stirring up trouble and spreading rumors. After the land police cracked down on three gambling cases in Jinzhuang Harbor the day before yesterday, the water police and land police had a sudden conflict, disrupting the market for a time. Subsequently, Xu Henian, a detective of the land police, was arrested by the water police. The two sides resisted each other and engaged in a fierce fight. Xu has now been temporarily released on bail by local figures. Both sides have submitted reports to their superiors for review and instructions.

### Huaiyin

Citywide Air Defense Drill

Today (the 16th) at 2:00 PM, the city of Huaiyin held an air defense drill. About ten minutes after the alarm sounded, five enemy planes flew in from the east.

In addition, the Huaiyin Normal School Affiliated Primary School and the County Anti-Smoking Hospital were designated as shelters. If there were any injured civilians, they would be taken to those locations for treatment. After about twenty minutes, two civilian houses in Zhang Garden inside the city and Li Tan outside the city were set on fire by bombs dropped by enemy planes. In addition, a poisonous gas bomb was dropped by enemy planes inside the Dabeimen gate. At that time, all the fire brigades and the Red Cross were mobilized to carry out rescue work. When the enemy planes left at 2:40 PM, a blackout drill was practiced for twenty minutes after 8:00 PM that night. The results were excellent.

### The True Meaning of National Salvation Through Unity

— Liu Shi

A Review of "The Truth About the So-Called Chinese People's Front and a Review of its Theory"; Seeking Advice from Mr. Luo Huanmei

Half a month ago, I heard that a newspaper in Nanjing published an article criticizing the "Chinese People's Front," which involved me. I was very skeptical at the time. I thought, I have never talked about any "Chinese People's Front," why would someone drag me in! It must be that my friends were mistaken, and I did not believe it was true. At that time, because I did not know which newspaper in Nanjing the article was published in, I could not find the original text, which was quite disappointing, but soon I forgot about this rumor.

During the Lunar New Year, I went to Suzhou to see the plum blossoms at the invitation of a relative. Although the plum blossoms were not yet in full bloom and there was no elegant plum blossom viewing event, I did not even get a good look at the daily newspaper during my few days as a guest. After returning to Shanghai, I heard from a friend about the article criticizing the Chinese People's Front, and it was republished in the Shen Bao on February 15, 16, and 17, titled "The Truth About the So-Called Chinese People's Front and a Review of its Theory," which did involve me and assigned me as a "theorist of union." After hearing this news, I was truly delighted and hurriedly searched through the pile of old newspapers for these three days' issues. I was fortunate enough to find them, and I realized that the words of wisdom I had long admired were bestowed upon me by Mr. Luo Huanmei.

After reading Mr. Luo's "Review" in one breath, I only felt that Mr. Luo had wasted his efforts. Because Mr. Luo is reviewing the "Chinese People's Front," but no one in China today is advocating the "People's Front." Then, Mr. Luo's so-called "truth" is naturally not "true," so there is even less to say about "theory" and "review." As for the part that involves me personally, I only feel extremely apologetic. I have nothing to do with the "Chinese People's Front" and have never talked about "Chinese People's Front." Facts speak louder than words, so why should I waste my words? Originally, Mr. Luo's "Review" this time was a complete miss, and there was no need to "review" it again. However, at a time when the call for national salvation through unity is high, Mr. Luo's remarks will actually hinder the great cause of unity. They are very harmful to the public, who are still vague about the true meaning of national salvation through unity. Therefore, I feel that I still have to come out and argue. I think that in today's world, where the whole country is forming an iron unity, it is not a complete waste of words.

First of all, I want to sincerely ask Mr. Luo and his like-minded friends to restrain their emotions a little. When discussing national affairs, please do not bring any anger. We know that only truth can persuade people, and the most cruel debate is the current facts. Today, China's "national destiny is in danger," as stated in the declaration issued on the night of February 16 by the Shanghai All Circles United National Salvation Grand Alliance. Without national unity, there is no way to stop the "enemy's aggression" and "recover lost territory. Without national unity, there is no way to save the countryside." In terms of construction, only the peaceful "completion of the nation's true unity can save the country." These words reflect the greatest demands and most common desires of the national public. Last year's special changes in Guangdong and Guangxi and the Xi'an Incident were all peacefully resolved by the government. We cannot deny that this is the government taking into account public opinion and implementing the will of the people. We cannot help but be moved. At the same time, this also shows how the people of the whole country are expecting unity and peace. But unity is not empty talk. The so-called unity is because it recognizes that there is still division and opposition within the country. If we avoid talking about the division and opposition in reality, that is not sincere talk about unity. If we fundamentally deny that there is division and opposition in the country, since reality is "one," then there is no need to talk about "unity." Because we have division, we demand "unity." There is not only one way to promote "unity." In the past, some people used force to seek "unity," but the lesson we learned is that using force to seek unity, in this process of unity, both sides have a lot of power consumption, which only eliminates national power and is not enough to manage "concentrated national power." Therefore, the people's demands do not advocate unification by force, but tend towards the road of peaceful unification. Today, if we do not talk about saving the country, then that is that. If we talk about saving the country, we must be a "truly patriotic Chinese." If he opposes saving the country through unification, then he is either a traitor or an idiot. If he also advocates saving the country through unification by force, then he is either ignorant of the domestic political situation and the demands of the broad masses of people, or he has ulterior motives. What explanation should peaceful unification be given? (To be continued)

### Fifth Sino-British Billiards Tournament Concludes, China Retains Championship

Zhu Qiliang Loses to Nie Kell Yesterday; China Wins by a Total of 418 Points

The fifth Sino-British billiards tournament concluded yesterday. In the five groups' scores, the Chinese team scored 2,866 points, and the British team scored 2,448 points. China won by a total of 418 points and won this year's championship.

Yesterday's Recap

Yesterday was the first group match for both sides. China's Zhu Qiliang played against Britain's Nie Kell. Zhu's skills were superior to his opponent's, but the result was a loss of three points because Zhu did not want to win too much and casually shot. The last two times he sent the red, he could end it, but the ball was near the pocket, and he was too hasty and failed again and again. Otherwise, there would be no such unexpected setback. Zhu Qiliang was the first to reach 300 points, exceeding Nie Kell by more than 110 points. However, he showed mercy on the gun, giving Nie Kell a chance to catch up, creating a situation where they were side by side. After 500 points, Zhu Qiliang stepped up his efforts, shooting out various methods one after another. When he reached 31 points, the enemy ball fell into the pocket, but he used the red ball to continuously shoot and pocket eight shots, reaching 55 points, a total of 597 points. With only one shot left, he could have finished the 680 points. Suddenly, he lost his mind. Nie Kell also had a score of more than 565 points, so he rose up and made a final move, but Zhu sent the red twice again without scoring, so Nie Kell was able to win 600 to 597. (Nie Kell) 200, 30, 25, 38, 21, 31, 12, 27, 25, 45. (Zhu Qiliang) 21, 20, 42, 20, 33, 36, 20, 33, 42, 27, 20, 50.

In the Sino-British billiards competition, China has won five consecutive tournaments. This year, it won three and lost two. The overall score is on the left.

### New Life Movement Third Anniversary Celebration

Attended by Over Six Hundred Representatives from All Circles, Emphasizing the Great Significance of the New Life Movement

Yesterday marked the third anniversary of the New Life Movement. The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association held a commemorative meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce auditorium at 10 a.m. yesterday morning, gathering over six hundred representatives from various institutions, organizations, and schools. Instructor Wu Tiecheng, due to official duties in Nanjing, sent Zhang Yuanruo to deliver the address. The proceedings of the meeting are recorded as follows:

Chairman Zhang Shouyong's Opening Remarks

At 10 a.m., the ceremony commenced. Chairman Zhang Shouyong delivered the opening remarks, stating, "Today is the third anniversary of the New Life Movement, which was initiated by Mr. Chiang Kai-shek and has become popular throughout the country. This afternoon at 8:30, Mr. Chiang will deliver a speech, which will surely offer valuable lessons for everyone. Today, I will draw upon what Mr. Chiang usually advocates – the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean – to elaborate on the meaning of the New Life Movement. I am not sure if what I say will be correct. If it is, please pay attention; if not, please forgive me or offer criticism. Because although the New Life Movement was initiated by Mr. Chiang, it requires everyone's efforts to implement it in order to live up to his teachings. First, let me discuss the relationship between the Great Learning and the New Life Movement. The Great Learning teaches people to proceed from the investigation of things and the extension of knowledge to sincerity of intention, rectification of the heart, cultivation of the person, regulation of the family, ordering of the state, and peace of the world. This means that things have roots and affairs have ends, and it is a consistent whole. These eight items must be based on the three cardinal guides: to manifest illustrious virtue, to renovate the people, and to rest in the highest excellence. The word 'to' in these three is crucial, requiring much effort and action to achieve the goal. Regarding 'renovate the people,' Master Cheng said that 'renovate' should be taken as 'new,' the 'new' in New Life. Zhu Xi said that 'new' means reforming the old. It is clear that manifesting virtue should extend from oneself to others, so that they too may be able to remove the stains of old habits. The stains of old habits have reached their peak today. The meaning of revolution today is to remove these stains. The meaning of construction today is to rest in the highest excellence. Zhu Xi said that 'rest' means inevitably reaching this point without wavering. The highest excellence is the ultimate in what is naturally right and proper. For example, the four virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are lethal. Is this not the ultimate in what is naturally right and proper? If everyone knows the ultimate in what is naturally right and proper, why should we worry about the country not being unified or the nation not being revived? Therefore, the first of the three cardinal guides is to set an example oneself, which is 'manifesting illustrious virtue.' The second is 'renovating the people.' The Book of Documents says, 'Renew the people.' The Book of Poetry says, 'Although Zhou was an old state, its mandate was new.' The third is to rest in the highest excellence, which means 'the superior man leaves nothing undone.' Zhu Xi said that from renovating the people, all rests in the highest excellence. Resting in the highest excellence takes various forms. In terms of self-cultivation, it involves cutting and polishing; in terms of function, it means that the superior man cherishes the worthy and is close to his kin; in terms of knowing the root, it ensures that there will be no lawsuits; in terms of sincerity within, it cautions against idleness and doing evil in solitude, and not to be like the inferior man who hides his evil after seeing the superior man; in terms of anger, fear, fondness, joy, sorrow, and worry, none should fail to be correct. Finally, in terms of the way to generate wealth, it emphasizes producing much and consuming little, which is tantamount to killing production. The Doctrine of the Mean speaks of the strength of the South and the strength of the North, emphasizing tolerance and gentleness in teaching, and not teaching people militarization. It speaks of kites flying and fish leaping, dressing in brocade and donning silk, which is tantamount to teaching people art. This is a brief explanation of how the Great Learning relates to the New Life Movement. Let me now discuss the Doctrine of the Mean. The Doctrine of the Mean is a characteristic of the Chinese people. Seeking the hidden and drawing on the strange is contrary to the Doctrine of the Mean. Confucius also said that the superior man embodies the Doctrine of the Mean, while the inferior man acts contrary to it, referring to this point. The wise exceed it, and the foolish do not reach it, hence the way is not practiced. Shun was very wise, but he used the Mean among the people, and everyone said, 'I know,' driving them into nets, traps, and pitfalls without knowing how to avoid them. The Song scholar Yuan Mengqi said, 'They do not know the nets, traps, and pitfalls, and simply take them to be broad dwellings and safe homes. How pitiable!' The practice of ordinary virtue and the expression of ordinary words, this is propriety; when there is something lacking, one dares not but strive, this is righteousness; when there is something extra, one dares not exhaust it, this is integrity; words accord with actions, and actions accord with words, this is a sense of shame. If people can always embody these seven sentences of the Doctrine of the Mean, they will naturally know propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. Everyone can be a superior man, and no one will be an inferior man. In their respective positions, whether rich or poor, in ease or hardship, there is no one who is not content. The root lies in being able to know propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, for dwelling in ease and awaiting destiny is vastly different from seeking danger and striving for greatness. The superior man has the three virtues of wisdom, benevolence, and courage, and also the nine standards for ordering the world and the state: cultivating the person, honoring the worthy, loving one's kin, respecting great ministers, being considerate of all officials, cherishing the common people, attracting artisans, treating distant peoples with kindness, and cherishing the feudal lords, all returning to the principle that without sincerity, there is nothing. Extending this to reviewing the old to gain new knowledge, this 'new' is the 'new' in the New Life. Zhu Xi's commentary is the best, saying that the old is what has been heard before, and the new is what is gained now. The Great Learning speaks of renovating the people, and the Doctrine of the Mean speaks of gaining new knowledge, echoing each other from afar. Continuing with the statement that being honest and generous is to attach importance to propriety, this propriety is the propriety of the four virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame in the New Life. With one propriety, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame can all be encompassed. Therefore, today I speak of the New Life Movement, presenting Mr. Chiang's frequent advocacy of learning the Doctrine of the Mean for everyone. The New Life Movement is the way of a true king. Although the way of a true king has no immediate effect, if everyone knows the importance of the New Life, then the way of a true king can be practiced. All ultimate excellence is contained within this. I hope everyone will live up to Mr. Chiang's fundamental meaning of saving China. As the Doctrine of the Mean says, introspect without guilt, have no evil in your will. Please everyone introspect, fulfill your responsibilities as citizens, each make a resolution, and have no evil in your will. The so-called having no evil in your will is to unify your will to defend the country, seek national order, and achieve peace in the world. This is what is expected of the people and gentlemen of the country."

Representative Wu, on Behalf of the Instructor, Delivers a Speech

After the chairman's report, Representative Zhang Yuanruo delivered a speech on behalf of Instructor Wu Tiecheng, stating, "Today is the third anniversary of the New Life Movement, and representatives from all circles are gathered here to hold a grand commemorative meeting. Mayor Wu, as the instructor of this association, originally intended to attend in person, but he had to go to Nanjing to attend the Third Plenary Session, so he could not be present. Therefore, I, Yuanruo, am representing him and delivering a rough speech. The New Life Movement has several major meanings. First, it is a revolution in life. Second, it is a construction movement for a new citizenry. Third, it is a movement for national revival. In terms of the first point, the revolutions in various countries of the world each have their own special meanings. There are political revolutions, industrial revolutions, and social revolutions. The Chinese National Revolution, due to different historical backgrounds, national spirits, needs of the times, and social conditions, contains many different meanings. It not only has the comprehensive nature of political revolution, industrial revolution, and social revolution, but also has the side effects of psychological revolution and life revolution. The New Life Movement, launched in Nanchang in 1934, is a revolution in national life. Although the initial meaning of this revolution is only moral and spiritual, its ultimate goal and its corresponding effects are greatly related to social reform, political innovation, and economic construction. In terms of the second point, the New Life Movement is a construction movement for a new citizenry. The purpose of revolution is not only limited to the destruction of the upper-level external things, but also focuses on the fundamental internal transformation. The conditions for establishing a country are not only limited to material development, but also value the encouragement of the national spirit. Although China is a cultural nation with the longest history, the thoughts, spirits, and living habits of the general population are now decadent and disorganized, unable to cope with the changes of the world and compete with others for survival. The New Life Movement, on the one hand, takes our country's inherent morality as the standard, so that the daily life of the people should conform to the spirit of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. On the other hand, it also takes the rationalization of life as the principle, so that all life actions should conform to the conditions of 'orderliness, cleanliness, simplicity, and punctuality.' It is indeed a basic construction movement for training modern new citizens. In terms of the third point, the New Life Movement is also a movement for national revival. The highest goal of the New Life Movement is to seek the militarization, industrialization, and artisticization of the people's lives. Advocating artisticization, transforming crude, violent, vile, and wretched behaviors, so as to seek the nobility of the people's lives; advocating industrialization, transforming the people's behaviors of stealing, fighting, laziness, and complacency, so as to seek the affluence of the people's lives; advocating militarization, transforming the behaviors of disorganization, fear of difficulty, and cowardice, so as to seek the consolidation of the people's lives. If the life of a nation can be consolidated in terms of national defense, affluent in terms of material, and noble in terms of spirit, this nation will undoubtedly be able to strive for its superior position in the international arena and develop its infinitely long and great life in the track of human evolution. The meaning of the New Life Movement is so profound and great, but the true essence of the New Life Movement is not here, because the philosophical basis of the New Life Movement lies in 'action' rather than in 'knowledge.' The basic essence of the New Life Movement values practice and does not advocate empty talk. The guiding principles of the New Life Movement, as everyone knows, are propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are not new or strange principles, but a kind of traditional thinking, the crystallization of our country's inherent moral civilization. Therefore, in promoting the New Life Movement, we really do not need to elaborate on the theory too much and engage in empty talk, but rather value the practical implementation and especially start from each person's own practice.

Our Chinese nation has always boasted of its spiritual civilization and prided itself on being a nation of propriety and righteousness. The ruling class and scholars of China for thousands of years have also regarded propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame as the ultimate principles for governing the country and teaching the people. However, as a result of thousands of years of empty talk and boasting, not only has propriety disappeared and shame been swept away, but also because the spirit of discipline and organizational ability are not as good as others, we have been ridiculed by 'rising nations.' This is not because we have no education, but because the principles of governing the country and teaching the people that our former sages and philosophers gave us have only become empty words and have not been transformed into practical actions, so that any profound theory cannot transform actual life. The so-called propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame have only become empty words boasted on the lips and have not become the creed practiced in life. Therefore, the principles of the sages teaching the people for thousands of years, because scholars who falsely defend the Way know but do not act, have not produced any practical effects in governing the country and promoting society. During the May Fourth Movement, some people shouted 'Down with the man-eating ethics,' but how could ethics eat people? It is only because knowledge and action are separated that the so-called ethics have long lost the true essence of the sacred Way. Therefore, during the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, a Mr. Yan Xizhai severely criticized those false scholars who engaged in empty talk about nature and principles and misunderstood the sacred Way, believing that their crimes were to mislead the people and that the harm they caused was even worse than Qin Shi Huang's burning of books and burying of scholars. Yan Xizhai said that spreading chapters and sentences is not the sacred Way, and competing to advocate empty talk is even less the sacred learning. The true essence of sacred learning is to teach the people to 'practice things,' hence it is said, 'Learning and practicing them constantly,' and 'Diligent practice is close to benevolence.' The two words 'practice' and 'action' are the true essence of sacred learning and the basic effort to implement the sacred Way. The New Life Movement is to implement the inherent moral principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame into the actual lives of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, which is most in line with the true essence of sacred learning and most sufficient to implement the spirit of the sacred Way. Therefore, the New Life Movement is absolutely not empty talk, but practical; not frivolous, but solid; not empty words, but diligent practice. The true essence and basic requirements of the New Life Movement lie in consistency between appearance and reality, consistency between words and actions, unity of heart and mouth, and unity of knowledge and action. For thousands of years, the principles of governing the country and teaching the people of the Chinese sages and worthies have been too numerous to count, but they have all become ornamental empty words and have not been developed into practical actions. Since modern times, the actions of patriots and people with lofty ideals who have run around to save the country have been even more vigorous and sensational for a time, but they have only had a momentary excitement and have not had a lasting force. They have only seen the advocacy of a few leaders and have not been practiced by the general public. Although the reasons for this failure are extremely complex, to summarize, it is due to being frivolous and not practical, so that words and actions cannot be consistent, and knowledge and action cannot be unified. All perfect theories cannot be developed into real power. The leaders of the New Life Movement, in shouldering the mission of their time, promoting the wheel of this movement, and leading the entire nation forward, should deeply remember this historical lesson and not repeat the mistakes of the past. On the anniversary of the New Life Movement, I put forward three hopes. The first hope is that the government should clearly define rewards and punishments and revitalize discipline. The second hope is that the society should clearly distinguish right from wrong and uphold justice. The third hope is that individuals should set an example and sincerely practice diligently. These three hopes are certainly necessary conditions for the success of the New Life Movement and have a related relationship. However, the third point is especially the root of the three, because the New Life Movement, in the most practical sense, is actually a movement of self-awareness and self-renewal. Its main purpose is to encourage the spirit of every citizen, so that they can love themselves, respect themselves, value themselves, be aware of themselves, strengthen themselves, and renew themselves, becoming citizens who strive upward, are enterprising, are self-reliant, and are constantly renewed. Therefore, I hope that every advocate or believer of the New Life Movement must first start from self-transformation, self-training, self-cultivation, self-effort, and self-practice. In this way, the New Life Movement can extend from oneself to others, from near to far, and achieve practical and universal results."

Li Tingan and Others Deliver Speeches in Succession

After Representative Wu delivered his speech, Director Li Tingan delivered a speech, stating, "Today is the third anniversary of the New Life Movement. The meaning of the New Life Movement has been explained in detail by the chairman and the representative of the instructor. I will briefly describe to you my observations. The matter of cleanliness advocated in the New Life Movement seems very simple, but it is of great importance. Cleanliness in the individual is the starting point for seeking personal health. Cleanliness in business is the starting point for seeking great results in business. Cleanliness in the country and society is the starting point for seeking discipline and order in the country and society. In all the guidelines of the New Life Movement, we feel that none are unimportant. In short, the New Life Movement is an essential element for the revival of the nation, so we must strictly follow it." Finally, Director Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech on behalf of Zhang Binghui, stating, "Because of the great importance of the New Life Movement to the nation and the people, the New Life must be promoted to the general public. Now, the Social Bureau not only requires all schools to follow the New Life Movement, but also tries to arouse the attention of the industrial, agricultural, and commercial sectors." Finally, slogans were shouted, and the meeting adjourned.

In the Afternoon, Divided into Four Groups for Inspection

The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association divided into four groups in the afternoon to inspect the implementation of the New Life in various institutions, schools, and organizations. The inspection situation will be compiled into a report and stored in the association. In recent years, various institutions, schools, and organizations have been very active in promoting the New Life Movement, so the results have been very good.

Solemnly Declares That the Rumor of Issuing Customs Gold Unit Notes is Inaccurate

A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Xi Demao, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, yesterday morning to inquire about the reorganization of the Central Bank.

### Representatives Attending the Chicago World's Fair Return Home and Arrive in Shanghai

Fujian Province Made a Profit of 30,000 Yuan at the Chicago World's Fair, Discussing in Detail the Inspection of Child Welfare Programs in the United States

Mr. Dong Kunfan, commissioner of Fujian Province's participation in the Chicago World's Fair, and Mr. Dong Guangying, director of public relations for the Products Association, representatives of our country's participation in the Chicago World's Fair, left the United States on January 19 and visited Japan on the way to see the country's education industry. They arrived in Shanghai by boat yesterday. According to Mr. Dong Kunfan, Fujian Province's participation in the Chicago World's Fair, with the Chinese-American silk lacquer statues and other products created by the Fujian Huier Hospital, promoted our country's culture and art, and won high praise from European and American people. The authorities of the Chicago World's Fair rated it as an international top-grade product. The total operating surplus for two years reached about 30,000 yuan in national currency (the expense of soliciting goods in 1934 reached about 19,000 yuan in national currency). Although lacquerware is a handicraft, it accounts for a large proportion of foreign exports. The Japanese lacquer industry has reward and research institutions in the country, as well as industrial and commercial associations, and foreign trade control, and the sales volume is amazing. It is reported that Mr. Dong has a foreign trade plan, but the hospital has been affected by the local economic exhaustion in recent years. At the same time, the hospital affairs are presided over by the current chairman, Mr. Shen Yongtiao, who can't take care of everything, and used about 40,000 yuan of the Chicago World's Fair fund. After the Chicago World's Fair closed, the two gentlemen ran around the United States, on the one hand, to promote our country's culture and art, and to plan the hospital's expansion plan, and on the other hand, to inspect the facilities of child welfare undertakings in the United States, and to investigate the organization of the New York World's Fair. The various groups of overseas Chinese in New York also paid attention and exchanged opinions with the two gentlemen, and wrote a letter, entrusted to the Executive Yuan of the National Government. Mr. Dong Guangying graduated from Shanghai Great China University, and later studied education at the University of Iowa in the United States. According to the two gentlemen, although the education system and social organization of various states in the United States are not completely the same, the national policy of health care is consistent. No matter how remote the countryside is, there are children's health stations to promote the work of maternal and child protection without hesitation. Ten years ago, the infant mortality rate was one hundred per thousand within one week. Through the efforts of the health station, it has been reduced to more than forty per thousand. Now, pregnant women die on the day of childbirth, only four per thousand. At present, American social figures continue to rise up in the movement to eliminate maternal and child mortality, with the aim of achieving the goal of reducing mortality. Since Japan started the Children's Health Consultation Center, the mortality rate of infants and young children has also decreased significantly. The central government is working hard to formulate a national health policy, so as to realize the plan to improve the physical fitness of the people and make them strong and beautiful. Looking back at our country's high mortality rate, it is impossible to calculate. Especially in this extraordinary period, the cultivation of national defense personnel is really urgent. The way of cultivation is to focus on children's health. The two gentlemen had long discussions with experts in various fields in the United States, and observed in many ways, and wrote an outline of the plan for the Children's Health Experimental Station in China, including ten plans from women's pregnancy to children's growth, starting with experiments to find the standard for health work. Ambassador Shi in the United States expressed deep sympathy and wrote a long preface to vigorously promote it. Ambassador Xu in Japan praised it very much and promised to be the initiator, so that domestic people could advocate this work, which is planned to set up a station in Nanjing and proceed step by step.

### Postal Savings Business is Developed

The Total Amount of Savings Last Year Reached More Than 50 Million Yuan

Last year, the domestic rural Zhaosu, industry and commerce were active, and the government made every effort to rectify, so the financial organization was stable, and the deposits of various banks increased sharply, which has been repeatedly recorded in various newspapers. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, since the Savings business was ordered to be handled by the post office concurrently, because its bureaus are generally set up in various places, and the procedures are also very simple, so the business has developed very rapidly. A reporter from the Central News Agency inquired from the bureau that as of the end of December last year, the total amount of savings in various bureaus across the country reached 55,715,765 yuan, including more than 39 million yuan in passbook savings, more than 11 million yuan in term savings, more than 4.7 million yuan in check savings, more than 70,000 yuan in lump-sum deposit savings, and children's savings, because it has only been open for two months, so the number is the smallest, with more than 6,000 yuan. If calculated by region, the total amount of various deposits is the largest in the Guangdong region, with 9,538,548 yuan, followed by the Shanghai Postal Savings Bureau, with 7,650,377 yuan, followed by the Shanghai and Peiping regions, with about 5 million yuan each, and the Shandong, Fujian, and Jiangsu regions with about 3 million yuan each, and the Henan and Hubei regions with about 2 million yuan each. Those with more than one million yuan include the Hankou and Nanjing remittance bureaus, and the Hebei, Shanxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Hunan postal districts. The other four districts, Jiangxi, Xichuan, Dongchuan, and Shaanxi, are within one million yuan. The Guizhou district is the smallest, with about 80,000 yuan.

Those who are old and over 55 years old, have worked for 15 years, are thrifty and loyal to their work, and are approved by the company. ㊂ Promotion: Those who work as ticket sellers for 25 days a month will get an increase of two promotion days, plus the two days already in place (for a total of four days). ㊃ The company should prepare two fixed buses, day and night, to be dispatched from the new and old factories respectively, to pick up and drop off drivers and ticket sellers. ㊄ The annual bonus should be issued by the company seven days before the lunar New Year's Day.

### Wang Chonghui Speaks of His Excellent Impression of the Third Plenary Session

President Jiang's Health Recovered; Tooth Extraction Before Returning to Beijing

Mr. Wang Chonghui, a member of the Central Committee, recently went to Beijing to attend the Third Plenary Session. Due to personal matters, he returned to Shanghai on the 18th. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Wang at his private residence yesterday and recorded the following conversation: "This Third Plenary Session was held in Beijing with more attendees than previous sessions. The impression was very good. Moreover, the Xi'an Incident was completely resolved peacefully before the opening of the plenary session, without any side issues, which is especially a good phenomenon. I returned to Shanghai due to personal matters, so I do not know the details of the proposals and the results of the discussions."

President Jiang's Health Recovered

"President Jiang's health has recovered and his spirits are much better than before. However, the injury to his back and spine has not fully healed. He wears a steel brace to prevent any vibration of the injured bone. Therefore, he cannot sit for long periods and was unable to attend the Third Plenary Session. Mr. Li Zongren originally planned to come north to attend the Third Plenary Session, but he was unable to do so due to pressing political affairs. The proposals he intended to make were also handed over to Mr. Huang Xuchu to take to Beijing and submit to the Congress for discussion. As for the report that Mr. Li Zongren and Mr. Bai Chongxi will come to Beijing in the next few days, I have not heard of it."

Current Japanese Cabinet Understands China

"The current Japanese cabinet's understanding of China is more realistic than in the past. The Japanese Prime Minister, Hayashi Senjuro, repeatedly expressed his intention to be friendly to China in his speeches and answers to questions from members of parliament, and hoped that the governments of China and Japan would become closer day by day, and that the people of the two countries would become more and more intimate. I deeply agree with Prime Minister Hayashi's words. If we want to seek the rapprochement of the two governments, we must first seek the intimacy of the people of the two countries. If the feelings between the people of the two countries are like fire and water, then the two governments will not be able to seek rapprochement. I sincerely hope that Prime Minister Hayashi's words of goodwill toward China will be proved by facts as soon as possible. As for the diplomatic policy of the current Japanese cabinet, there is no concrete decision yet. Before I have studied it, I do not want to make any criticism."

Will Go to Beijing After Tooth Extraction

"After returning to Shanghai, I went to see a doctor yesterday (the 18th) because I had a loose tooth on the left side, and took an X-ray. It was found that the diseased tooth was festering and spreading into my left cheek. Today (the 19th), I went to see a doctor for a nasal ailment and learned that the diseased tooth was related to the nasal ailment. Therefore, I decided to have the diseased tooth extracted within the next few days and then return to Beijing."

### Juxingcheng Bank to Increase Capital

Capital to Be Increased to 10 Million Yuan; to Be Reorganized as a Limited Company

Juxingcheng Bank is the earliest commercial bank established in Sichuan Province. It was founded by the wealthy merchant Yang of the province and is a limited partnership with a capital of one million yuan. In recent years, its business has been extraordinarily developed. In view of the fact that construction projects in the province are actively underway, in order to enrich the bank's funds and assist in construction, it will increase its capital to ten million yuan and will be reorganized into a joint-stock limited company in accordance with the bank law promulgated by the ministry. The head office is currently planning this. According to information learned from the Shanghai branch, the bank was originally the Juxingcheng Trading Company, which engaged in import and export operations and made considerable profits. In 1915, it was reorganized into a bank. In 1929, it applied to the Ministry of Finance for a license. Its capital of one million yuan was divided into limited and unlimited shares, each half. All unlimited shares were subscribed by the Yang family, and a portion of the limited shares was also subscribed. The remainder was sold to relatives and friends. Over the past twenty years, due to effective management, a solid foundation has been established. Twenty-one branches and offices have been established in Sichuan Province and along the main ports of the Yangtze River. In 1920, 400,000 yuan was allocated and approved by the Ministry of Finance to establish savings, and the scale has been further expanded. Recently, the bank is determined to develop construction in the province, so it has decided to increase its capital by nine million yuan to ten million yuan.

### International Industrial and Traffic Safety Conference Invites Chinese Representatives to Attend

The Preparatory Office of the First International Industrial and Traffic Safety Conference in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, has repeatedly sent letters inviting the Shanghai Industrial Safety Association to send representatives to participate in the First International Industrial and Traffic Safety Conference to be held in Amsterdam starting on April 20 of this year. It is learned that the conference was initiated and resolved by industrial safety organizations from more than ten countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, and representatives from the International Labor Office at a meeting in London in early 1935. The first international conference will be held in Amsterdam in 1937, inviting governments of various countries and industrial or traffic safety organizations to send representatives to participate. The Dutch representatives were appointed to be responsible for all preparatory matters. In recent years, China's industrial and transportation industries have become increasingly developed, resulting in daily increases. The annual losses from disasters are extremely large. According to estimates from last year, the losses in property alone exceeded 50 million yuan, and the number of deaths and injuries exceeded 10,000, which has a profound and significant impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. However, disaster prevention work is purely a specialized technology, and there is still a lack of considerable knowledge of this skill in China. It is reported that the Shanghai Industrial Safety Association will hold a meeting on the tenth of this month to discuss the dispatch of representatives to attend.

### Workers of the Public Welfare Yarn Factory Presented Six Demands Yesterday

### The Dispute Over the Exercise of Authority by the Outgoing Spanish Consul Ferreira

The Consulate Secretary Wei Shengqu Accused Ferreira of Being a Rebel; The Consular Corps Reported to Our Government for a Decision

The New Voice News Agency stated that the Spanish expatriates in the city, numbering about 130, originally enjoyed consular jurisdiction. Since the country's Consul General in Shanghai, Ferreira, and Vice Consul La Rakeksi, resigned successively, they have fallen into a state of being unrestrained, and there is nowhere to appeal if they encounter anything. Unexpectedly, Ferreira, the country's Consul General who had already resigned to the Madrid government, suddenly notified the French Concession Patrol (the consulate is on Avenue Joffre) to continue issuing passports to Spain and exercise his authority as Consul General. At the same time, Wei Shengqu, the former secretary of the Spanish Consulate, has been acting as Consul General since Ferreira's resignation, loyal to the Madrid government, so he also notified the French Patrol that Ferreira is now serving the rebel government, but at present, China and most other countries still recognize the Madrid government as representing Spain, so Ferreira's actions have no diplomatic standing, etc. This has caused a fierce dispute between the two sides. The Consular Corps heard the news, and the leader of the corps, the British Consul General, Britanan, also had no way to resolve this problem. He has sent letters to the consuls of various countries and our government, requesting our side to decide how to deal with this matter.

### Shanghai Circles Will Hold the Fifth Anniversary of Short's Death

And Visit His Tomb at Hongqiao

### The Criminals' Conspiracy Process in the Jiangsu Bank Robbery Case

Long Spying on the Inside Story of Jiangsu Bank; Continued Hearing by the First Special Court Yesterday

The Jiangsu Bank branch on Xinzha Road was robbed by several bandits at 5:00 p.m. on the first of this month, attempting to steal more than 7,000 yuan that was being escorted to the head office. As a result, a shootout occurred between the bank's bodyguards and the robbers. Shi Jinzhi, a watchman of the bank's Security Office No. 194, was shot and killed, and bodyguards Jiang Ziqin and Gu Wenlin and rickshaw puller Chen Youru were all shot and injured. One of the robbers was also shot, so they failed to steal the money.

Abandoning a Gun

And Fleeing; afterwards, the Hua Chief Inspector of the Laoza Gate Patrol Room, You A'gen, Detective Wang Shanqing, Ye Yusi, detective Zhu Shanghe, etc., found the robbers Chen Changfu, Chen Li's, Zhang Shaoqing, Zhao Jinrong, Zhao Youren, Bai Fugui, Qian A'rong, Bao Hemen, Shi A'mao, Xiang Renlin, Yang Yuchun, etc., a total of eleven people, and seized two guns, many bullets, and a cane gun at 44 Lane 353, Xinzha Road and 920 Hart Road. They were handed over to the First Special District

Court for Interrogation and Detention

Yesterday morning, this case was continued by Judge Feng Shide in the first criminal division. The patrol room's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the patrol room is now requesting the release of Chen Li's and He Chunlin because it has been found that they have no direct relationship. He also requested the disposal of the household appliances, etc., seized in the robbers' den. Judge Feng then ordered Chen Li's and He Chunlin to be released. The seized furniture, etc., should be temporarily stored in the patrol room. If it is inconvenient to preserve them, they should be allowed to be auctioned off, and the

Sale Price Paid to the Court

Lawyer Ru continued to state that, in addition to the Jiangsu Bank case, the defendants were also involved in ㊀ the robbery of Ding Zihua's property worth 576 yuan at 39 Lane 997, Haining Road, at 6:15 p.m. on January 9; ㊁ the robbery of He Qingsheng's house at 45 Hexing Lane, Wuzhou Road, for 100 yuan at 7:30 p.m. on December 23 last year. Now, he first stated the Jiangsu Bank case. The reason is that the defendant Chen Changfu, with Zhang Zhensheng, who is at large, came to Shanghai with two guns at the beginning of last month and met a Mr. Ren, who used to run a car dealership. Ren also had a gun, so they

Conspired to Rob

The Jiangsu Bank, so Chen rented 4 Lane 353, Xinzha Road, about 30 yards away from the bank, to find out the truth. Later, Chen learned that the bank must have a large amount of money delivered to the head office every day at 5:00 p.m., but the bank has watchmen and bodyguards guarding the delivery, and there is also a Chinese patrol station on the Zhenlu Bridge pier opposite the bank, so if they have to take action, it must be with a large number of people. So he invited Zhang Shaoqing, Zhao Jinrong, Zhao Youren, Bai Fugui, and the fleeing Lao Wei, Li Kunshan, to join them. Bai

Has His Own Gun

At 4:00 p.m. on the 3rd, Zhao Jinrong, Mr. Ren, and Ren's concubine A'ying rented a car No. 12314 from Yunfei Car Company and drove to Lincoln Road. Zhao immediately took out a gun and drove the driver Yao A'nan down. Zhao Youren and Li Kunshan, who were waiting there, tied him up and robbed him of 8 and a half yuan of banknotes in Yao's pocket. Then Ren drove the car straight to the scene of the incident, stipulating that Zhang Shaoqing would rob the money, Zhao Jinrong would deal with the watchman, Zhang Zhensheng would deal with the bodyguard, Bai Fugui would monitor the Chinese patrol on the bridge pier, and Ren would act as the driver. When Zhu Renhai

Carries the Money Out

They opened fire separately. As a result, Zhao killed the watchman, Zhang Shaoqing injured the rickshaw puller, Chen Youhai injured Gu Wenlin, and Zhang Shaoqing was also shot and injured, but Zhu Renhai fled to a woman's house after seeing the robbers firing, and the money was spared from being robbed. Now, each defendant has written a confession and should be interrogated. The court questioned the witness Yao A'nan once. As it was almost noon, there was not enough time to continue the interrogation, so it was decided to reschedule the hearing.

### Wife Filed for Divorce Due to Husband's Drug Addiction

The Debate Has Ended and a Date Has Been Set for the Verdict

Zhu Weixiang, a native of Haimen, is currently 36 years old and works as the head of a rickshaw at Yongfeng Brick and Tile Company, No. 366, Rue Siccawei in the French Concession. He first married a woman surnamed Chen from the same hometown, and after Chen's death, he married another woman surnamed Zhang from the same hometown as his step-wife. Then, in January of 1930, he took a woman named Wu Xiuzhen (26 years old this year) from the same hometown as a concubine and lived with her until now. She gave birth to a boy, who is 5 years old this year, and lives with Zhu in Shanghai, while Zhang lives in the countryside. Recently, Wu Xiuzhen believes that Zhu is addicted to drugs, so his monthly income is not enough for the family's living expenses. There are often disputes between husband and concubine, and their relationship has broken down. Wu Xiuzhen, unbearable to live with him to grow old, left Zhu's residence and temporarily resided at her relative's place at No. 3 Avenue Joffre. On the one hand, she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Special Court's Civil Division against Zhu for the termination of their cohabitation agreement. According to the lawsuit, the court notified the defendant, who also hired lawyer Tang Hao to file a defense, and raised the issue that the court had no jurisdiction over the plaintiff's status as a concubine in Haimen. The case was heard once and then rescheduled. Yesterday, Judge Li Liang continued the hearing in Civil Division Seven. The plaintiff arrived with her lawyer, but the defendant and his lawyer did not. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, the defendant has been legally summoned several times and has not appeared. Because he is addicted to morphine, he was previously sentenced to one month in prison by the court. He does not know how to repent, but goes a step further and sells drugs, fearing punishment, so he dare not appear in court. He requested permission to hold a unilateral debate and render a judgment. The court also summoned the witness Zhang Baoliang to testify about the defendant's marriage to his cousin Zhang. According to the testimony, his cousin has not returned to her natal home since she married Zhu Jixiang and is now in the countryside. After verifying the situation, the court declared the debate closed and set a date for the verdict.

### Lawyer Li Jichuan Accused of Seduction

Qu Yinong Was Angry Because She Was Insulted and Glared at Li When She Left the Court

Lawyer Li Jichuan, residing at No. 12, Xixiang Kang Lane, Maibige Road, was residing at Yongfeng Fang, North Sichuan Road, between the autumn and winter of last year. Qu Yinsong, a youthful and beautiful woman from Guangdong married to Feng Weichen, a Cantonese, suspected that Li was having an affair with her. After Feng discovered Li's love letter to Qu, he hired a lawyer to file a

Criminal Private Prosecution

Against Li Jichuan in the First Special District Local Court for Seducing His Wife. During the court hearing, Li denied the alleged facts. He also presented a written agreement of Feng and Qu's cohabitation, claiming that Qu was Feng's concubine. The judge ruled that Feng had no right to file a personal complaint according to the law and dismissed the case. However, Feng was not convinced by the ruling and has appealed to the Second Branch Court. Qu Yinsong's mother, Qu Luo's, was originally in her hometown in eastern Guangdong. Hearing the news that the lawsuit had failed, she

Came to Shanghai from Guangdong

And acting as her daughter's legal guardian, she also hired a lawyer to file a criminal private prosecution with the First Special Court against Li Jichuan for seducing her daughter and causing her to leave her family. She claimed that her daughter was born at Zi hour on the fifth day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar in 1918, making her only 19 years old last year. From October 30 to December 21 of last year, Li Jichuan used aliases such as Liang Xing, Zhang Jin, and Wang Zhen to lure her to the

Nanjing Hotel

And New Asia Hotel. She slept with him for six times in a row, making it impossible for the plaintiff to supervise her, which constitutes a crime under Article 240, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shijie opened the court to hear the case. The plaintiff, Qu Luo's, through her representative lawyer, finished stating the intention of the lawsuit. Then Qu Yinsong testified that she married Feng at the age of sixteen in the

Dongyang Buddhist Hall

The wedding was held at the Old Bazi Road, and the wedding officiant was a Dongyang pastor. She then recounted the time and place of her six adulterous affairs with Li Jichuan. Finally, she said that her husband only found out after discovering the love letter that Li gave her and firmly denied that she was Feng's concubine. When the court questioned the defendant, Li Jichuan, he absolutely denied having any adultery or communication with Qu and claimed that he was being

Framed Due to a Grudge

Etc. Afterwards, the lawyers for both the plaintiff and the defendant debated each other to the end. The court then decided to set a date for sentencing next Friday morning. When Qu Yinsong was leaving the witness stand and passing in front of Li Jichuan, she could not help but widen her almond eyes and glare at Li. Her cherry lips were also trembling frequently. This kind of posture was especially beautiful.

### Yang Ruisheng Kidnapping Case Concluded

Sentencing Scheduled

Yang Ruisheng, owner of Yang Rui Construction Company at No. 15, Lane 332, West Soochow Road, was kidnapped on the morning of January 9th at the entrance of the lane, with a ransom of 60,000 yuan demanded. Subsequently, the authorities of the two districts of Shanghai and Nanhui cracked the case, arresting six kidnappers: Lu Mufa, Diao Hailin, Fei Wangshi, Wang Changsheng, Hua Mutan, and Diao Mulin. Yang Ruisheng was rescued and all were transferred to the General Police Department for interrogation at the First Special District Court. This newspaper has already reported on the matter. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng continued the hearing at the Eighth Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated that the handgun and six bullets seized at the time have been transferred from the Nanhui County Government to the police, and the forensic department has verified that the gun has not been involved in any other cases in the Settlement. Judge Huang repeatedly questioned each defendant, and the court concluded the debate in the case. Sentencing is scheduled for the 26th of this month. The defendants remain in custody separately.

### Asiatic Petroleum Company's Chinese Staff Donates Funds to Aid Suiyuan

Although the Suiyuan war has temporarily calmed down, the bandits will certainly not give up easily. The enemy is currently busy reorganizing and training, actively preparing for another invasion. It is believed that the enemy's third invasion will be the biggest crisis in Suiyuan Province. Therefore, our frontline preparations seem to be fading away along with the silence of the frontline. Now, the Chinese staff and workers of the Asiatic Petroleum Company have stepped forward, voluntarily donating 800.05 yuan in legal tender, which has been handed over to the Shanghai Wentong Bank for remittance to the front lines. This is enough to arouse public sentiment for continuing to aid Suiyuan. It is hoped that all sectors will strive together.

### Abundant New and Old Copper Coins, Exchange Rate Gradually Stabilizing

The Tobacco Exchange Industry Consults with the Central Bank and Revises the Method of Issuing Subsidiary Coins

At the end of the lunar year, the national currency price in this city fluctuated because of the shortage of old copper coins. It was rumored that some people were monopolizing and manipulating the market, causing the exchange rate to shrink and become inconsistent. For the sake of stabilizing the exchange rate, the Tobacco Exchange Industry Association consulted with the Central Bank and agreed to distribute 55 boxes of new copper subsidiary coins, totaling 11,000 yuan in national currency, to its members throughout the city every day to facilitate exchange. At that time, the mint did not ship many coins, and it was still felt that the supply was insufficient. However, since the Lunar New Year, it has been observed that the supply of new and old copper coins on the market has gradually become abundant, and the income from door-to-door sales and exchanges is sufficient to meet the demand, so the exchange rate has also stabilized. Chen Liangyu, chairman of the Tobacco Exchange Association, re-negotiated with the Central Bank a few days ago to change the exchange date, temporarily setting it on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and distributing the coins as usual. The Shanghai South Office of the Association announced yesterday that "In order to facilitate the exchange of one-cent new copper subsidiary coins for the benefit of members, the Association previously consulted with the Central Bank and originally planned to entrust the Association to distribute 55 boxes to members, totaling 11,000 yuan, every day. Members were to go to the Association to exchange coins at 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM every day. Now, because new and old copper coins are abundant, the method has been revised again. For the time being, the coins will still be distributed as usual on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays according to the original amount. Those South Shanghai members who wish to exchange coins should register and pay the fee at the office at No. 427, Fumin Road, Dananmenkou, before 12:00 PM every day according to the stipulated date, so that the quota can be determined and received on time. No handling fee will be charged. Please be informed. This is a special announcement."

### Telegraph Bureau Revokes Broadcasting Licenses of Eight Radio Stations

Ministry of Communications Radio Station Increases Power

The Ministry of Communications has already implemented the ban on eight radio stations, including Dunben, in this city, starting on January 1st. The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau specifically issued a notice yesterday saying, "This Bureau has been ordered by the Ministry to revoke the licenses previously issued to the following eight broadcasting stations in this city: Tongle (XLHO.72.OK,C), Zhou Xiejie (XLHn760K.C.), Dunben (XLHL800K.C), Anding (XHHO,800K.O., Shiyin (XHHR134OK.C.), Xinsheng (XLHF,138OK,C), Huiling (XLHF138,OK,C), and Huaguang (XQHF,148,OKC), and to recover the call signs and frequencies previously used by these stations. We have already complied with the order and notified the stations. In addition, we are issuing another notice that the licenses of these eight stations will be invalidated from February 1st of this year. Furthermore, no one may arbitrarily use the seven call signs and frequencies listed above without the approval of the Ministry of Communications, so as not to violate the law." In addition, in view of the poor management of some private radio broadcasting stations, the Ministry of Communications has specially improved the Ministry-operated Shanghai Broadcasting Station of the Ministry of Communications. Recently, two iron pole towers have been built at the intersection of Tongfu Road and Jing'an Temple Road, and the power of the antenna has been increased from 500 kilowatts to 2,000 kilowatts.

### Ditch Workers on McLean Road Encroach on Road Workers' Jobs

Mutual Aid Association Asks for Investigation and Prevention

Although the Municipal Council has declared that the road workers in the Public Concession will not be reduced, and the situation is gradually stabilizing, the encroachment of ditch workers on road workers' jobs has recently occurred again. The Road Workers' Mutual Aid Association has specially written to the Municipal Council to stop this. The original letter stated, "We are deeply gratified to see the report stating that the Council has declared that it will not reduce the number of road workers. However, in the past, road workers and ditch workers each had their own specific jobs and did not encroach on each other. However, recently, the encroachment of ditch workers on road workers' jobs has occurred. After many negotiations, the problems in most districts have been resolved. However, in the McLean Road district, ditch workers, under the protection of the foreman, continue to encroach on road workers' jobs. Repeated negotiations have been ineffective. In order to maintain their livelihood, the road workers are specially writing to the Council to order the McLean Road Public Works Department to investigate and stop the encroachment on road workers' jobs, so as to avoid disputes. This is what we earnestly pray for."

### Two Austro-Hungarian People Commit Suicide

Dr. Bumi, an Austrian doctor, has been practicing medicine in Shanghai for several years and currently resides at a certain number on Broadway Building. At 8:00 AM yesterday, he was found by a waiter dead from a gunshot wound in his room. The police are still investigating the cause of his death, but judging from the current situation, it must have been suicide. The deceased has no relatives in Shanghai. His wife and daughters are all residing in Europe. The deceased's father has been doing business in the Soviet Union for many years and is quite prestigious. The deceased was born in Qingdao and is 45 years old.

Mr. Selansky, a Hungarian artist in his early twenties, committed suicide with a gun in the bathroom of a friend's residence in the French Concession yesterday morning. He is currently in the hospital, on the verge of death, and there is fear that he will not survive. The deceased opened a photography studio in Shanghai. Several months ago, due to sluggish business, he closed the studio and moved to a friend's house. Therefore, he must have committed suicide due to pessimism.

### An Employee of the Bank of Communications Who Stole a Large Sum of Money Was Arrested

The Legal Tender Was All Stored Inside Two Pillows Made by His Mistress

Wang A'tu, an employee of the Bank of Communications in this port, has been working in the bank for many years. According to the bank's usual practice, if the cash department wants to use money, it must send Wang to Wang Buyuan, the custodian of the vault, to get the money for use. This has become a habit. On the 16th of this month, Wang A'tu took advantage of his position to steal 5,000 yuan in banknotes from Wang Buzhou, the custodian of the vault, and fled his job with the money. After the Bank of Communications found out, it reported the case to the General Police Department and offered a reward of 1,000 yuan for his arrest. The other day, Chinese detective Peng Jixiang learned that Wang A'tu's mistress, Tang Chuan, from Ningbo, lived at No. 21, Tongle Lane, Oujia Road, and arrested her. Then, according to Tang's confession, together with detectives from the Nanshi Police Department, Wang A'tu was arrested in Dingxin Lane, Wengjia Lane, and temporarily detained at the police station, pending a written transfer order. On the other hand, according to Tang's confession, all the banknotes were stored in two pillows specially made by Tang and hidden in a friend's house at No. 335, Yuanfang Road. The detectives then went to the address and found 4,590 yuan in legal tender and two pillows and brought them back to the police station. Yesterday morning, Tang Chuan was first sent to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the facts of the case and requested detention for investigation. After Judge Dai briefly questioned Tang Chuan, he ordered her to be detained for seven days for further questioning.

### Water Levels Rise in Changsha, Hunan Shipping Route Reopens

Grain from Changsha Can Be Shipped to Shanghai

Since October of last year, the route from Shanghai to Changsha has been blocked due to the shallow waters of the Xiang River, which fell to two inches below the bottom, resulting in the disruption of the route between Changsha and Shanghai. Passengers and cargo between Shanghai and Hunan were first transshipped by private boats in Lulintan, and then transshipped in Yuezhou. Due to the shallow waters, it was difficult to transport, resulting in the accumulation of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cargo destined for Hunan in Hankou, Yuezhou, and other places. Recently, Hunan cargo merchants have come to Shanghai from Changsha in large numbers to start purchasing goods. The local shipping companies have also received telegrams from Changsha stating that the water level of the Xiang River has risen sharply in recent days, and shipping from Hankou to Changsha can be resumed. Shallow-draft river vessels can now pass unimpeded. The large amount of grain accumulated in Changsha and the cargo accumulated in Yuezhou and Hankou have already been loaded onto ships sent by the various shipping companies. The shallow water fees on this route have also been reduced.

### Income Tax Office Explains Collection Doubts

The Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance received an official letter from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on letters from the Egg Industry and Dye Industry Associations, requesting explanations on various points of doubt regarding income tax, which were explained separately as follows: A. Part of the request for explanation from the Shanghai Egg Industry Association: 1. In accordance with the customs of industry and commerce, employers usually provide food and lodging for laborers and low-level shop assistants. Therefore, those whose monthly salaries are less than 30 yuan will be temporarily exempt from tax on food and lodging provided by the employer. The rest will be taxed uniformly. 2. The expenses incurred by employees due to business, which are actually paid for each job, do not fall within the scope of salary and should be exempt from tax. 3. If the monthly salary income of drivers and cooks reaches 30 yuan, the employer shall withhold income tax. B. Part of the request for explanation from the Shanghai Dye Industry Association: 1. Profit-making enterprises shall settle accounts once a year. The beginning and ending dates of the business year, that is, the so-called settlement period of the association, shall be determined by the operators themselves. There are no explicit restrictions in the regulations and detailed rules. For example, if the business year starts on January 1st of this year, it will be a business year until the end of February of the following year, and the taxable amount will be calculated based on the net profit of this year. However, in the first year of income tax collection, if the start date of the business year is in 1936, and the end date is after the month and day of 1937, the profits from the beginning of January 1937 shall be calculated and taxed in accordance with Item 7 of the Draft Notice on the Collection of Income Tax on First-Category Profit-Making Enterprises if there is income. Those without income will not be taxed. 2. According to Article 3 of the Provisional Income Tax Law, those whose income is less than 5% of the actual amount of capital will not be taxed. 3. If the capital and business of the head office and branch office are completely independent, the income amount shall be calculated separately. If the capital of the branch office is allocated by the head office, and the final settlement of profit and loss is still the head office, it cannot be considered that the capital and business are completely independent, and the income shall not be subject to the separate calculation regulations.

### Biography of Vice Admiral Limigu, Commander of the French Far East Fleet

This news was previously transmitted by Havas News Agency. Now, the French Shanghai Daily has obtained the biography of the commander as follows: According to the report, Commander Limigu was born in 1883 and is only 54 years old this year. This time, he is taking the position of Commander with the rank of Vice Admiral, which is actually one of the youngest people in the French Navy.

### Ningbo Fellow Association Sends Telegram to the Ministry of Railways

Requesting the Addition of Stations in Tang, Yang, and Zhang

The Ministry of Railways has the news that it will lay railway tracks from the Baisha Machinery Factory in Ningbo to the Sanbei Wharf in Zhenhai to facilitate transportation. However, Tang, Yang, and Zhang are located in a strategic location. Wang Lihe, the representative of the citizens of the town, sent a letter to the Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai, advocating the addition of a station in the town. According to the information, the association telegraphed the Ministry of Railways to adopt it. The telegram said, "Zhang Diao Jian, Minister of the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing, according to the letter from Wang Lihe, the representative of the citizens of Tang, Yang, and Zhang towns in our hometown, it is heard that the Ministry of Railways will build a railway from the Baisha Machinery Factory in Ningbo directly to the Sanbei Wharf in Zhenhai. This is not only of great significance in national defense, but also greatly facilitates commercial transportation and travel. However, the road only has one station in Hantang Street. The merchants, etc., believe that the distance is too far. The Tang, Yang, and Zhang areas are located in the center of the road, and the residents in the area reach more than 10,000 households, and the four sides are accessible, which is an extremely important place. It is necessary to add stations. For this reason, I implore your association to advocate, and please forward it to the Ministry of Railways, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration to allow the establishment of stations on the Tangyangzhang Road to facilitate the public, which is deeply appreciated, and other circumstances. After investigating the town, it is located in an important place, and the people are crowded and dense. The public request of the town to add stations is a very necessary request. Therefore, the facts are telegraphed to Chen Jianhe, and Fusi will be adopted and implemented, which is deeply desired. Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai, Yu Hede, etc., salute."

### Attempted Robbery at Tanziwan Nanhua Store

Store Owner Seizes Handgun and Bullets

Wang Shunxing, a double-fronted Nanhua (Southern Goods), cigarette paper, and sundry goods store located at No. 319 and 321 Tanziwan in Zhabei, is owned by Wang Guoxiang (age 47) from Jiading. The business is doing well, attracting the attention of robbers. Yesterday morning at 2:40 AM, Wang and his family were asleep when they heard someone knocking on the door. Initially, they thought it was a customer with an urgent need to buy something, so Wang got out of bed and opened the door. Unexpectedly, two robbers wearing black short jackets and speaking a Jiangbei dialect barged in. One robber brandished a handgun and warned them not to make a sound. Wang Guoxiang knew they were robbers, so he acted quickly, grabbed the hand of the robber holding the gun with both hands, and shouted for robbers. The other people in the store also got up. It turned out that the robbers only had one handgun. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, they threw the handgun on the ground and tried to escape. At this time, the police officers from the Tanziwan Police Station also arrived after hearing the commotion. They reported to Inspector Luo Siwei, who led police officers to the scene. They found that the robbers had first dug a hole in the vacant room at No. 317 next door, intending to enter through the kitchen, but were unable to. They then knocked on the front door. The handgun was a five-round revolver, numbered 46163, with four live rounds. Yesterday, the police station reported the case to the News Bureau with the handgun and four bullets. Wang Guoxiang, the store owner, was questioned, and the case was reported to the Police Department's Inspectorate for the record.

### Wei Zhongxiu and Others Sent to the First Special Court

Wei Zhongxiu, formerly known as Wei Songfeng, the head of the detective team of the former Shanghai Songhu Police Department, Zhang Xixiang, a detective of the Xinghui Public Security Bureau, Dong Yinxuan, who had worked as a comprador for a shipping company, and Wu Acai, were involved in a case where they had people take two handguns stored in a car to the Bund and report secretly to an important person that there were reactionary cadres plotting to assassinate them. After the driver reported to the police, Wei and the other three were arrested. After investigation, it was determined that they had fabricated the scheme to gain credit and rewards. They were sent to the First Special District Court, which sentenced Wei, Zhang, and Dong to two years in prison each, and Wu to one year. The Public Security Bureau, fearing that they might have been planning an actual assassination, conducted an investigation for more than ten months. Considering that Wei and the others had been detained for 15 months, Wu Acai had already served his full term. The Public Security Bureau also determined that there was no actual assassination plot. Therefore, they were transferred to the local court for custody the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the prosecutor's office sent police to transfer Wei and the other three to the First Special Court for the execution of their sentences.

### Fire at Deshun Fireworks Store Caused by "Slam Bangs"

Customer Flees the Scene

The Deshun Fireworks Store at No. 118 Wangjia Wharf in Nanshi caught fire at around 8:00 AM yesterday. A customer came to buy a large quantity of "slam bangs" (a type of small firework). The owner, Gu Songlin, showed him a large bundle of "slam bangs," and they began to discuss the price. However, the customer offered too low a price, and the two began to argue. Unexpectedly, the customer, angered by the situation, threw the "slam bangs" into the store, causing them to explode. The firecrackers and "slam bangs" piled inside were knocked over and also exploded, causing a fire. Fortunately, fire trucks from various fire brigades arrived and put out the fire.

### Zhengyi Society Rehearsal

Soliciting Domestic Goods to Enhance Festivities

The Zhengyi Society, located on the seventh floor of the Continental Department Store on Nanjing Road, is an upscale club organized by industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai. To celebrate the New Year, they will hold a New Year's Eve gathering for members on the 25th of this month (Lunar New Year's Day) at 6:00 PM. The drama department of the society is rehearsing Peking opera to add to the fun. It is said that various domestic goods organizations in Shanghai, such as the Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of Domestic Goods, the China National Products Marketing Association, and the executive directors of the China National Products Company, are mostly members of the society. To encourage members to use domestic goods, these organizations have sent letters to major domestic goods factories, soliciting exquisite products to be distributed to the members attending the gathering. According to Mr. Xu Jianruo, the person in charge of soliciting gifts for the society, they have received very valuable gifts from various factories in recent days, including a chrome-plated steel sofa from the Dahua Iron Factory, velvet cheongsam dresses from the Meya Silk Weaving Factory, exquisite toys from the Kangyuan Factory, woolens from the Zhanghua Factory, electrical appliances from the Huasheng Factory, a pocket billiard set donated by member Wang Jingshan, and calligraphy scrolls from Yang Chuqiao, Yan Mengfan, and Fu Tienian.

### The Relief Society Rescues a Religious Friend

Zhang Chen, a standing committee member of the Chinese Christian Church, has been in charge of the organization of religious groups since receiving orders from the central government, and has also served as the director of the Shanghai office. He has a considerable record of defending the clergy. Whenever there are cases of false accusations, he always speaks out to exonerate the victims. Recently, Hu Kaifa, director of the Shanghai Faxin Church, along with the family of church member Zhou Yuqing, reported that Zhou Yuqing, originally from Rugao, had been working as a carpenter in Shanghai, but had returned to his hometown after being unemployed for a long time. He was accused of being a traitor by the Rugao Security Bureau and detained by the county government. More than fifty local baojia leaders jointly guaranteed his release, but to no avail. They came to Shanghai to seek help. Zhang, upon receiving the report, immediately sent an official letter to the Rugao County government, proving that Zhou Yuqing was a church member and had no treasonous behavior, and requested his release. He then received a reply from the Rugao County government, No. 281, stating that one foreign coin and three pages of notes and five copper coins had been found during the search, and that they were investigating the case with the county party headquarters. After receiving the letter, he continued to send letters to the party and government organs of the county, and provided explanations. He also inquired about the situation by telegram, but was told that they had not received orders from the province and could not release him. He then petitioned the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order the release. Yesterday, he received a letter from the Rugao County government, No. 353, stating that Zhou Yuqing, a suspected traitor arrested in the county, had been found to have no suspicion of treason based on the previous letters from the church, and had been released on bail after the situation was reported. This is a great stroke of luck that Zhou could be released from his wrongful imprisonment thanks to Zhang's reasonable explanation.

### Dry Cleaning Expert Arrives in Shanghai

Mr. Mao, a Chinese national, has been engaged in research on dry cleaning technology in the United Kingdom for many years. He has invented various washing agents and methods for cleaning and restoring cotton, wool, and silk fabrics. After repeated experiments, all have been successfully completed.

### Letters to the Editor

To the Editor: I have just read a news item in today's edition of your newspaper regarding Shen Xinglu, a law clerk, impersonating a police officer.

To the Editor: I have just read a news item in your February 19th edition regarding the lawsuit filed by Yu Zhan Yijuan, a wealthy businessman from Huizhou, against Yu Muhan for accounting.

Furthermore, the plaintiff did not make any claims of extravagance during yesterday's court hearing. I am writing on behalf of my client to request a prompt correction to clarify the facts. Sincerely, Wu Zhiping, Attorney-at-Law, February 19, 1937.

Special Article

### Unity and Peace (Continued)

— Pan Gongzhan

(2)

Since everyone needs peace, how do we seek it? Unity. Only unity can achieve peace. Why? To answer this question, we must first understand the reasons for the lack of peace and the occurrence of war. The reason for the lack of peace and the occurrence of war is due to division. The east is divided, and the west is divided. You want to be the leader of this place, and he wants to be the overlord of that place. They each claim hegemony and do not yield to each other, so wars occur. From the Xinhai Revolution to the "September 18th Incident" in 1931, why was there constant warfare every year? In the final analysis, it was because the forces of division were stirring, rising and falling. If this traditional feudal concept and separatist ideology are not transformed, our country will certainly not be peaceful. Everyone has read the history of our country and knows that this situation is called the division of heroes. The opening remarks of Romance of the Three Kingdoms say: "The general trend of the world, after a long period of division, will unite; after a long period of unity, will divide." These eight words can encompass China's history for thousands of years. We hope that this will not happen again in the future, that is, we hope that unity will be permanent and will not be divided again. According to past history, whenever there is a period of division, there will be years of war, natural disasters, and man-made disasters, and the people will not be able to live. Whenever there is a period of unity, the country will be prosperous, and its prestige will be far-reaching. Let us look at the era of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, what prestige the country had. Looking at the era of Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty, what dignity the country had. On the contrary, what was China like during the Sixteen Kingdoms period of the Five Hu? What was China like during the Northern and Southern Dynasties? When heroes are divided, the people are devastated. When the country is unified, culture and education are spread far and wide. Therefore, if we want peace, we must first have unity. Only after Li Shimin unified did the prosperous age of Zhenguan in the early Tang Dynasty occur. Only after Zhu Yuanzhang unified did the peaceful rule of Hongwu in the early Ming Dynasty occur. Historical lessons clearly tell us that our country needs peace only through unity, and peace can be achieved after unity. Apart from those who have lost their sanity, no one would say that division can bring peace.

According to my explanation, peace and unity are not equal. Peace is our goal. What method do we use to achieve our goal? We use the method of unity to seek peace. So peace is the goal, and unity is the method. Using the method of unity to seek peace is true peace and lasting peace. No one dares to guarantee that peace is eternal, but we always hope that peace can be maintained for a longer period. If we do not use a truly unified method to seek peace, it is a superficial, paper-thin fake peace that will soon be exposed. For example, after the Liangguang Incident, everyone thought there was peace, but who knew there would be the Xi'an Incident? It can be seen that without achieving true unity, there will be no true peace.

Why was Japan able to achieve peace after the Meiji Restoration? It should be known that before the Restoration, Japan was also in decline, just like China now, subject to the shackles of unequal treaties, the oppression of Western imperialism, and even its status was not as good as that of China at that time. Why was it able to transform to its current position in the sixty or seventy years after the Restoration? Its foundation was completely built on the abolition of the feudal domain system during the Meiji Restoration. In the past, Japan's national power was dispersed in the hands of feudal lords, which was tantamount to division. Because of the extensive feudal movement, the power held by the feudal lords who were in control of the separation was concentrated to the central government, and then the country was unified by the establishment of the king's power. Because the country was unified, then there was peace, strength, and the ability to step onto the stage of modern countries. Therefore, the abolition of the feudal domain system was the unified national salvation movement of the Japanese Meiji Restoration. Bismarck's assistance to William I in establishing the German Federation was the unified national salvation movement of Germany. The establishment of the Kingdom of Italy by the three heroes, Mazzini, Cavour, and Garibaldi, was the unified national salvation movement of Italy. History is there, and it can be reviewed.

Speaking of Japan, why was it able to promote this abolition of the feudal domain system? Everyone knows that the Meiji Restoration learned the new laws of the West, but on what basis did it learn the new laws of the West? To be honest, it learned the new laws of the West on the basis of Sinology. The so-called foundation of Sinology is the learning of Mr. Wang Yangming, a great Confucian scholar of the Ming Dynasty in China. Japan took this learning as the foundation of its restoration, upheld the spirit of "revering the king and expelling the barbarians," and resisted foreign insults. It was under the spirit of these four words that it was revived. Is "revering the king and expelling the barbarians" an inherent spirit of Japan? No. This is China's inherent treasure. Confucius compiled the Spring and Autumn Annals, expressing the spirit of "revering the king and expelling the barbarians." Because it was the decline of the Zhou Dynasty and the rise of the princes, and the royal family was weak, Confucius advocated "revering the king." The Spring and Autumn Annals specially wrote about the first month of the spring king, which was to honor the correct calendar of the Zhou king. The so-called "expelling the barbarians" is to resist foreign barbarians. Confucius had made several impolite criticisms of Guan Zhong, such as "Guan Zhong's instrument is small!" "If Guan Zhong knows etiquette, who does not know etiquette?" But on one occasion, Confucius sighed: "Without Guan Zhong, I would have to wear my hair disheveled and my lapel to the left." So he said that he was "benevolent! He was benevolent!" What benevolence was it? It was the benevolence of uniting the princes and correcting the world, which is also the benevolence of "revering the king and expelling the barbarians." It can be seen that "revering the king and expelling the barbarians" is China's inherent treasure. Japan was able to learn this spirit, so it was able to revive.

Do not think that I am turning over antiques here. The autocratic king is certainly no longer there, but a country always has a "central" authority. Now we cannot say "revering the king," but we should say uniting under the central authority. Now that there is international equality and global communication, we can no longer say "expelling the barbarians," but "resisting the enemy" can be said. So "expelling the barbarians" is "resisting the enemy." If foreigners do not become our enemies, they should of course be friends; if they must become our enemies, we must resist. So in modern terms, "revering the king" is "unity," and "expelling the barbarians" is "resisting the enemy." We must also revive the Chinese nation based on the spirit of these four words. The Japanese Meiji Restoration is a very good example.

It should be known that these four words "revering the king and expelling the barbarians" cannot be reversed. From the literal meaning, "revering the king and expelling the barbarians" and "expelling the barbarians and revering the king" seem to be no different, but in fact, the order contains the most profound principles. Only by revering the king can we expel the barbarians, only by internal unity can we resist foreign enemies. This is a matter of course. Let me extend another sentence: unity is internal stability, and resisting the enemy is external defense. We must first stabilize internally and then defend externally. Unity leads to the result of peace, which is internal stability. Peace allows us to accumulate strength to resist the enemy, which is external defense. Therefore, resisting the enemy after unity is true resistance, and it is resistance with strength. This is also an unbreakable truth.

Now let's review the situation in China in the last hundred years. The history of the last hundred years tells us not to complain about anyone, because this is the inevitability of the historical evolution of China. It should be known why the Xinhai Revolution succeeded so quickly. Of course, it relied on the propaganda of revolutionary doctrine, but in the late Qing Dynasty, anti-Manchuism and the Three People's Principles still relied on secret propaganda, and not many people necessarily knew about them. Why did the Republic of China come into being shortly after the Wuchang Uprising? It was because the success of the local separatist forces representing the landlords and gentry in overthrowing the central monarchy before China embarked on a capitalist production system. According to the research of insightful historians and sociologists, since Qin Shihuang unified China, commercial capital has developed day by day, causing rural production to decline and farmers to lose their jobs. At a certain stage, the number of unemployed farmers increased, and there was no way to deal with it, so peasant revolts occurred. These peasant revolts could cause the long-unified situation to be re-divided, becoming the division of heroes. After the division, we seek unity again, and it becomes a unified situation. Therefore, the history of thousands of years has been circulating in these six words "after a long period of unity, there will be division; after a long period of division, there will be unity" no less than seven or eight times. The rapid success of the revolution at the end of the Manchu Qing Dynasty can be said to be mostly due to this historical cycle.

### Yarn

Warehouse stock of yarn increases daily, spot yarn declines this month

Speculators rolled positions into March, thus the price rose 1.70 yuan; forward prices consequently improved; Sichuan merchants purchase fine yarn.

The yarn market is calm, and the overall trend is stabilizing. The downward trend in the three-grade yarn market has subsided. At the same time, spot yarn sales are still holding up, and Sichuan merchants are actively purchasing fine yarn, boosting market sentiment. Many parties are rolling spot positions from February into March, so the March contract alone rose 1.70 yuan. However, industry players generally expect prices to fall, and warehouse stocks of yarn have exceeded 20,000 bales by the end of this month. It is estimated that deliveries for the February contract will be around 25,000 bales.

### Marked Yarn Prices Fall This Month

The opening prices of marked yarn contracts, except for the current month, showed a slight increase due to the sharp decline at yesterday's close. However, warehouse stocks are increasing daily, approaching 20,000 bales, leading to a bleak sentiment among industry players. However, Indian merchants and securities and financial firms firmly held onto their absorbed quantities, resulting in a standoff between the two sides. As a result, all marked yarn contracts rose by 1.49 cents compared to yesterday's closing price, except for the current month contract, which fell by 1 cent. The afternoon opening saw lackluster activity in the current month contract, but the February contract was remarkably firm due to position rolling by speculators. Forward months showed some improvement. After the second session, spot yarn transactions were reportedly still around 2,000 bales, indicating good market sentiment. As a result, all contracts rose again by 4, 5, and 8 cents compared to the morning close, except for the current month, which fell by 4 cents. Sold by: Xincheng 1,400 bales, Yongchang 1,000 bales, Changfeng 2,450 bales, Changji 800 bales, Senkang 600 bales, Runkang 1,100 bales, Dachangcheng 750 bales, Yicheng 650 bales, Dafeng 1,850 bales, Yuda 1,000 bales, Jifeng 500 bales. Bought by: Jinchang 1,000 bales, Daqing 1,250 bales, Gengfeng 2,750 bales, Renfeng 2,550 bales, Shengyuan 1,650 bales, Tonghe 1,050 bales, Xiecheng 800 bales, Xinhua 850 bales. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.

Yarn Sales Still Weak at 2,000 Bales

Spot yarn sales are still good. Statistics show that all merchant groups purchased a total of 1,908 bales throughout the day. Selling prices are stable. The purchase volume of each merchant group is listed below:

Cotton Market Activity Lacking

The cotton market is flat, and the atmosphere is peaceful. There is no excitement in the Indian and American cotton markets. Prices fluctuate up and down within 2, 4, and 5 points all day long. Speculators lack enthusiasm, but some see potential due to farmers' reluctance to sell. However, inland inventories are high, and most of the stock has not been shipped out.

Marked Cotton Gains Profit Through Covering

The opening prices of marked cotton contracts showed slight increases as yesterday’s closing price had a sharp fall. Yesterday, short positions covered for profit, but the momentum was not very strong due to the weak Indian and American cotton markets overseas and the resulting decline in market sentiment. Furthermore, many in the industry believe that it's only a small profit to sell short. As a result, all marked cotton contracts rose 1.2 cents compared to yesterday's closing price. The afternoon opening saw little progress, and the situation became quiet with sluggish trading. As a result, all contracts rose another 5 points compared to the morning close. Sold by: Dafu 3,400 dan, Deda 1,000 dan, Jifeng 3,800 dan, Hengyi 5,900 dan, Renfeng 2,200 dan, Xiecheng 2,100 dan, Changhe 5,900 dan, Changyu 1,500 dan, Taichang 1,600 dan, Changfeng 1,100 dan, Fukang 2,200 dan, Xincheng 1,300 dan. Bought by: Yuda 4,000 dan, Gengfeng 3,600 dan, Shenji 2,500 dan, Yuan Yi 1,200 dan, Xinhua 1,000 dan, Hexing 2,000 dan, Ruida 1,500 dan, Wangtaixing 17,600 dan, Yongda 1,000 dan. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.

Cotton Mills Watch and Wait

Spot cotton sales are extremely slow, factory demand is quiet, and the source is unknown.

Tianjin Flower and Yarn Market Firm

(Tianjin Quick Report) The flower market in Xibei, Tianjin is trending upward. Factories and firms are entering the market due to the start of the new year, which created good sentiment and active market. Gongda Factory bought 500 bales, and Tongcheng Company bought 208 bales, both at 48 yuan. Baoji bought 450 bales at 47.50 yuan. The cotton yarn market is also firm, with prices slightly higher at the start of the new year.

Small Amount of Pledged American Cotton Sold

Yesterday, American cotton opened with prices down 3 points to up 1 point. The market was sluggish, and most transactions involved speculators closing out March positions and rolling them into later months. Industry players and foreign firms were buyers, but their actions were offset by local merchants and New Orleans sellers. Speculation was lacking, and most industry players were watching and waiting. Short selling decreased, and a small amount of pledged cotton was sold. Spot demand was quiet, and prices were slightly easier, but the closing was firm. Spot prices fell 1 point, and futures fell 1 point to up 3 points. British cotton spot prices rose 4 points, and futures fell 1 point. Indian cotton initially rose due to scattered purchases by European exporters but then retreated due to speculators closing out positions. Ultimately, active short covering led to another firming. According to the report, Bengal fell 0.25 rupees, Oomra fell 1 rupee, and Broach fell 1 to 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (18th dispatch)

According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 19th is: Broach at 221 rupees, Oomra at 203.25 rupees, and Bengal at 178 rupees, all down 0.25 rupees.

Osaka Spot Yarn Prices Plunge

### Piece Goods

Dark-Colored Goods Continue to Soften

Yesterday's cloth market was slightly weak, due to the sluggishness of both domestic and international cotton markets. Customer demand for spot goods was slow. Warehouses have a very large inventory, and market sentiment is gradually becoming uneasy. East-produced white goods declined slightly (0.025 yuan per piece). Prices of white goods from our factory were stable. Sales of dark-colored goods such as wool fabric, straight-warp drill, and straight-warp satin were slow. Prices for fine wool, [unclear], straight-warp satin, [unclear] floral straight-warp, and our factory's goods have fallen 0.0125 to 0.025 yuan. Bleached cloth, plain and patterned pongee prices generally increased with the new year, but actual sales haven't picked up. New Year business in all regions are only small amounts. Yesterday, Tianjin merchants continued to import nearly 200 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill from Qingdao brands such as Hua Wu. Because dyeing factories have gradually resumed operations, color-cloth dealers in our street have slightly increased their stock. Dealers of East-produced fine cloth and fine twill are also not seeing strong sales, with only 200-300 bales in trade. The factory believes that the auction price of various cloths in Qingdao is too high, and the current month's inventory is exhausted. They have no intention of selling in the long term. Factories and merchants are all observing the actual sales trend after the Lantern Festival to determine their next move.

As Month-End Settlement Approaches, Speculators Gradually Closing Long Positions in Flour

Market Sentiment is Depressed, Falling More Than 0.05 Yuan; Activity by Outside Traders in Distant Months Limits the Decline

Yesterday, the flour market showed near-month declines and distant-month stability. Wheat prices in Chicago and Canada increased by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan, while prices in Liverpool saw minor price improvements. At the opening, speculators with long positions in the current month contract were forced to close out their positions due to the upcoming month-end settlement. There was no significant absorption of these positions through actual sales, leading to a depressed market sentiment, similar to what happened in January. The decline was still around 0.05-0.06 yuan. The March contract also fell by 0.04 yuan initially, but later saw minimal trading and recovered by 0.01-0.02 yuan. The April and July contracts saw strong buying by outside traders, and declines were minimal. As a result, the opening price for those months were better by 0.015 yuan. If actual sales in the current month fail to pick up, there is still potential for further declines, because it's impossible to create arbitrage opportunities without actual sales, making it difficult for long positions to close smoothly.

Old Wheat Futures Decline, New Wheat Rises

Yesterday's wheat futures market opened with continued declines in all months in the morning. Although wheat prices rose by 0.02-0.03 yuan, market sentiment was weak, and opening prices were depressed. The current month contract fell by 0.1 yuan, March and April fell by 0.06 yuan, June fell by 0.1 yuan, and July fell by 0.05 yuan. Then, despite favorable weather, long positions in distant-month flour pulled the market, and market sentiment improved. Distant months recovered by 0.03-0.06 yuan. According to industry insiders, wheat seedlings are in good condition everywhere this year. If the weather remains favorable, new crops are unlikely to be favorable. Spot wheat prices are falling frequently in the auction market, and factories are increasingly watching and waiting. Fufeng only bought 400-500 bales of Huai'an wheat, priced at 6.50 to 6.52 yuan, about 0.01 yuan lower than the previous day.

Few Buyers of Early Indica Rice

Yesterday, the market for early indica rice continued to be weak. Sales by local merchants are slow, and merchants from Beiyang, the Northwest, and Xiamen have not inquired. Shantou merchants only took 100 bags of red rice. Guangdong merchants made minor purchases. Only local merchants were active, while supplies from the Yangtze River increased daily, with 10,000-20,000 bags arriving daily. Cargoes on the way are abundant, and sellers are eager to sell, so prices continue to fall by 0.03-0.1 yuan. Total sales were 6,274 bags of Jiangxi rice and 565 bags of Hunan rice.

Sales of Thin Rice Also Sluggish

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, shipments arrived from various sources, totaling 23-24 vessels, with approximately 6,700-6,800 shi of cargo. There were more than 20 vessels with thin rice. Local market sales remained sluggish, and sales by the Baowei also stopped. Only Qingdao merchants bought one vessel of thin rice, further weakening the market. Thin rice prices continued to fall by 0.1-0.2 yuan, while thick japonica fell by 0.1 yuan. Supplies of foreign sharp rice and Yinyuan rice were scarce, keeping the prices stable. The future outlook does not appear optimistic.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 27-28 vessels arrived from various locations along the river. Market sales were poor, with little activity. Prices for white japonica fell another 0.1 yuan, early rice barely held its ground, and thin rice fell by 0.06-0.07 yuan. Yangbu Dujia sharp rice fell by a small amount to 0.1 yuan. White Yuan rice loosened, and the prices of other goods were weak.

Heavy Short Selling of Standard Soybean Cake

—Market Still Listless—

Yesterday, the market for standard soybean cake continued to be listless. Supplies from the Northeast are very high, while sales are poor. Local merchants are watching and waiting, and the market is in a state of oversupply. Furthermore, firms have been heavily short selling for several days, especially paying attention to short selling the distant-month marked oil. The price for the April and May marked oil continued to fall by 0.45 yuan, while the price for marked cake fell by 0.015-0.005 yuan. Near-month oilcake sales were active due to the low price, and spot sales were relatively active, shifting market activity toward stabilization. The price of marked beans fell due to the high inventory of Dalian goods, making the market listless. Prices continued to fall by 0.02-0.04 yuan.

Mobil and British-American Tobacco made efforts to buy, gradually tightening the market. The market was tightest at noon. In the afternoon, the market loosened slightly, but because banks maintained prices and Chinese merchants bought forward exchange, it recovered to a neutral level. The closing selling price for the British pound was 1 shilling 2 pence 53125, and for the US dollar it was 29.625 yuan, with the British pound down 0.03125 and the US dollar up 0.0625 compared to the previous close.

### Securities

Outstanding Accounts for the Current Month Still at 20 Million

Yesterday's market prices on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange fell significantly. Most trades were position rollovers, and the trend had obviously stagnated. Early in the month, there were still liquidations, but then trading shifted to buying. After a period of stagnation, the market may still move upward. There are only three days left for the February futures contract, and the outstanding balances are still around 20 million, making a squeeze inevitable. Some believe that Chinese and British gold bonds have risen to 95% of face value overseas, and with Sino-British economic cooperation, the outlook is good. Yesterday, there was heavy selling of numbers 10 and 11 at the opening, and short covering on number 47 depressed the market price by as much as 0.1 to 0.6 yuan.

### Dried and Prepared Goods

Black Melon Seeds of Smaller Size Selling Well

You Nan Meat Firms Holding Firm

Since the beginning of spring, the upper-grade black melon seeds haven't seen much movement in sales because the price is already high, so the opening price has softened slightly. However, various merchants have already purchased over 1,000 bags of smaller-sized black melon seeds. Whether this can develop will depend on how the sales turn out. Yesterday, several merchants offered two hundred bags of the smaller-sized black melon seeds at 21-20.5 yuan. The transactions were slow. According to customer opinions, there still isn't much stock, and so the price is unlikely to drop soon.

It was said earlier that You Nan meat merchants were determined to hold the price at 48 yuan, but firms were waiting to see. There has been no movement yet. It was heard that the merchants still desire a high price and aren't willing to budge from 48 yuan. If sales pick up, then it wouldn't be difficult for the price to be realized.

### Silk and Tea

Shanghai Silk Sees Limited Trading

Recently, the silk market has been hesitant due to repeated small declines in the Japanese raw silk market overseas and the traditional Chinese New Year. There has been little activity or excitement. As of yesterday, Japanese and American silk prices had gradually risen. The price of Yokohama spot silk remained unchanged from the previous day, while the quick-term contract rose by 8 yuan. New York Japanese silk rose by 1 point for 83 degrees and 2 points for 75 degrees. Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk each rose by 1 point, while selling prices on the exchange fell by about 0.5 point for both near and distant month contracts.

### Oil Market

White Tung Oil Prices Rise Rapidly

After the Great Closure, foreign firms in Hankou began purchasing white tung oil, gradually increasing market activity.

In recent days, the price for April tung oil has been 57.8 yuan, and the price for spot oil has increased to 58.4 and 58.8 yuan. According to telegrams last night, the price is trending toward 60 yuan, showing a rapid increase. It is also reported that foreign firms have not purchased enough, and even if supplies increase slightly, there will be enough demand to absorb it. Therefore, the future market is still expected to rise.

### How to Cope with Children's Education Expenses?

— Zhang Wanqing

The winter vacation passes quickly, and in the blink of an eye, it's time for school to start again. At this time, I think no parent, unless they are "penniless," wouldn't be making plans for their school-aged children's tuition fees!

The term "tuition fees" is just a general term for "education expenses." If children are "young" or "day students," then they only need to pay a sum of "tuition," and other expenses can be mixed in with daily expenses and other costs, without having to be "categorized separately." However, this is ultimately not a proper method. You must know that children's age is "increasing day by day," and children's education expenses are "rising day by day." Parents' income may be able to get by safely for the time being, but who knows what will happen in the future? Therefore, the best method is still "prevention is better than cure." Here, the author has a few well-known methods that people "cannot do" or "do not want to do" and presents them again for everyone's attention.

1. Preparations after the honeymoon. Newly married couples, after organizing a small family, should not forget to "make plans for unborn children." Because every newly married couple doesn't know when their children will come, or even thinks it's unimportant. Know that it's better to "prepare for a rainy day" than to "dig a well when thirsty." Therefore, all newly married couples, in their daily budget, should include an item for "future children's education expenses," so that each month at the end of the month, they can store this sum of money in a reliable bank. As for the amount, it doesn't have to be fixed; it can be determined according to their current situation. Save more if they can afford it, save less if they can't, and at the end of the year, make a final summary. After the settlement, it can be used as "fixed-term" savings. After that, no matter what, the principle is "do not misappropriate." In this way, when the children are born, it will surely be a considerable sum of money. If, unfortunately, there are no "offspring," then saving every year and transferring this sum to "old-age pension" is also better than nothing.

2. On-time savings after children are born. After the children are born, the parents must save a certain amount of money into the bank every month. When saving, the amount can be determined according to the lowest income situation at the time, because if it is too much, perhaps in the future when their income is less, they will not be able to continue. Fixed term of ten or fifteen years are acceptable. Monthly savings should not be interrupted. In this way, when the children reach the period of higher expenses in middle school, the parents will no longer have to worry, or say, "There is no money, no need to study anymore!"

3. Pre-saving in ordinary times. This is the least good of the above two items. Because before having children or when children are young, there is no need to worry. However, when children grow up and spend more money, if no preparations were made in the era before having children, nor plans were made after the children were born, then "grasping at straws" is the only way to go.

The method is this: Based on the approximate amount of daily past expenses, and then make a detailed pre-check, and save a certain amount each month from firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, tea, and other expenses, as education expenses. Rather drink less tea, use less oil, play mahjong less, put on less makeup, but this "education fee" for the children must not be less! Each month, "save the extra money in the bank," and when it's time for the children to go to school and pay tuition in the autumn or spring, the parents will no longer have to cry and beg everywhere to "borrow" money.

### The Lonely Life of Modern Women

— Zhiyun

The London Evening Standard recently published an article by psychologist Mrs. Madi, entitled "Modern Women." She said that among the modern women who discussed psychological problems with her, one was the most striking, because she said, "I am really bored with nothing to do."

Those women who are too busy with things cannot help but laugh when they hear her words. But I have to advise "women who are too busy with things" to pity the women who are "really bored with nothing to do." There used to be a woman who was "bored with nothing to do," who was the wife of a magistrate in a certain provincial city. She said that her idle life made her feel extremely bored, and felt that living like this was too worthless. She felt that living like this was very shameful, but she could not specifically point out what she was dissatisfied with in life. Her marriage was very happy. Her two sons were also very good, both physically and mentally healthy. But in this superior environment, she often felt unhappy, because she felt the loneliness of having nothing to do. Although she had a good relationship with her husband, her husband worked outside all day long. Her only hobby was playing golf, but she was not proficient in it. In the past, her two sons kept her quite busy, but since the sons entered school, she was idle. Housework and socializing only occupied a small part of her time, and she had no other hobbies, so she often looked forward to holidays. Because on holidays, she and her family would go to a small villa in the suburbs for vacation. She grew up in the countryside, so she had a great interest in the garden. Later, she got her husband's consent and simply lived in this suburban villa, and then she regained her interest in life, because she found work in the garden.

In this example, it seems that the occurrence and solution of the problem are very simple, but at present, under this formula, I don’t know how many women are really bored and have nothing to do. This is a phenomenon produced under modern culture, the result of everyone wanting to be modern women. Although they have household work to do, they are not happy to do it, and in some organizations and professional circles, they are deeply closed and refuse their intrusion. So they are wandering around, with nothing to do, but if they can each find their own way according to their natural hobbies, no one needs to worry about not getting a happy life. Before machine production affected living standards, women's lives were limited to the family. But in modern times, the life of a wife or mother has retreated to a part of the entire life. They all want to be women who are happier than their sisters or mothers. They all want to apply the rest of their time to social life that is more valuable than household work, and thus created the ridiculous result of being idle and having nothing to do. Although some people are indeed content with leisure, most of them feel extremely lonely and disappointed, and realize that they are not living, but simply passing the days.

Translator's note, this article is concise and to the point. Although the author is talking to British women, it is no different from a painful criticism of modern women in our country. I believe that there are many modern women in our country who are also "really bored and have nothing to do."

### Common Sense for Pregnant Women

— Zhenya

Should a pregnant woman temporarily withdraw from society and hide in her room waiting for her little baby to be born? If not, then how should a pregnant woman take care of herself? This is a problem that modern pregnant women and even women who are not yet pregnant are eager to solve. American famous doctor Josephine H. Kenyon recently published the answer to this question in the famous American family magazine Good Housekeeping. Now, according to what I remember, I will introduce the general meaning of the article as follows:

Today, a woman does not need to withdraw from society when she is pregnant. If you are a working woman, you can continue to serve until a few weeks or even a few days before delivery. However, the way to take care of yourself cannot be ignored, otherwise there will be danger.

The first thing to pay attention to is the clothes you wear. Ordinary women often wear tight-fitting clothes for the sake of beauty, but this is not suitable for pregnant women, because it is harmful to the fetus. A pregnant woman must wear loose and suitable clothes, and must pay attention to the size of the abdomen that will expand in the future, so that it will not be hindered.

The second thing to pay attention to is the shoes you wear. Shoes must of course be loose, but especially important is that the toe must not be too pointed, and there must be enough space for the toes to stretch freely. The soles must be flexible, and the heels should not be too high. It is better to wear flat rubber garden shoes if possible.

In addition to clothing and shoes, pregnant women often pay attention to: at least four hours a day must be outdoors, but it is not four hours in a row. You can distribute it throughout the day, for example: one and a half hours outdoors in the morning, one and a half hours outdoors in the afternoon, and one hour outdoors in the evening. Isn't it a total of four hours outdoors in a day? However, the most important thing is not to fix the time you spend outdoors. If you feel tired at any time, you should rest immediately and do not force yourself. If you like gardening life, do not squat down, you must take a small stool to sit on, so as not to press your abdomen and cause danger. When bending down, do not use your abdomen, use your hips.

If you are tired, if you want to rest on the sofa or chair for a while, never forget to put an orange under your feet so that your feet can be stretched straight and flat. If you feel tired when sitting and want to change your posture, then don't worry, just change it often according to your body's needs.

A pregnant woman needs at least nine to ten hours of sleep every night. Even if you don't want to sleep after a meal, you should force yourself to rest for an hour. In your spare time, you can play the piano or draw pictures. In short, you can entertain yourself as you like, but don't use your eyes too much. If you want to avoid eye fatigue, there is also a way, just close your eyes and rest for a few minutes every now and then.

Pregnant women can ride in cars, but they cannot travel long distances, especially bumpy roads. Finally, it should be noted that pregnant women need to rest more, and should be happy all day long, and not accumulate a little melancholy in their hearts.

### Female Newspaper Vendor

— Chen Tianci

Shanghai is really a world of women. As long as it is a woman, no matter what she does, she is always more advantageous and has a way out than a man.

The section of Luban Road in Lujiawan has always been distributed by male newspaper vendors day and night. Since a female newspaper vendor riding a bicycle, about twenty-one or two years old, came to peddle newspapers, shops and households have flocked to subscribe to her newspapers, and her business has been exceptionally prosperous.

One day, I met her on the road and asked her what she thought of the newspaper vending business. She sincerely replied, "Being a small newspaper vendor like us is a very pitiful thing. We are busy all day long, but we still can't get enough to eat, because we only earn one or two dimes a month for delivering a newspaper. If we can deliver one hundred copies a month, we will only have ten or twenty yuan. Think about how we can make a living and support our families. Speaking of me, although my business is better than other newspaper vendors, it is still very difficult for me. Every morning, I have to go to the newspaper office to pick up the newspapers and deliver them to each household, and it takes about nine or ten o'clock to finish. But my legs are already numb and I can't bear the load. In the afternoon, at four or five o'clock, I have to deliver the evening newspapers, so I am busy all day long. In the autumn, the weather is still mild, so I don't suffer much. But in the winter, it is really unspeakable suffering. Not only can I not stand the whistling northwest wind in the morning, but I also have to ride this wretched bicycle. If I am not careful, there will be danger. In addition, what makes me feel the most painful is the harassment of those customers who touch and move their hands. Although I am a million times unwilling in my heart, I still have to smile. If I don't, I will provoke their anger and break my rice bowl. So I think women are the most pitiful, especially the women who serve in our society!" After she finished speaking, she couldn't help but sob. At the same time, after hearing her words, I also understood a lot about the world.

### Spring Returns to the Earth

### Contemporary Mulan Notes

— Chen Cuina

The newspaper of the 21st of last month published a story about a contemporary Mulan, which said: "Last autumn, when the army was marching in Huangling, Ganzhou, because the bandits in front were slightly reduced, the camp was stationed for half a day. I passed by a small market and saw an old man holding a volume of remnant manuscripts in his hand, chanting with great interest. I asked him, and he said: 'A certain camp of the National Army guarded this place some time ago. After the disaster of fire, public and private documents were scattered and incomplete. This is also one of the remnant manuscripts; the inscription says: Collection of Poems and Swords from the Army, which was written by a young military officer, who is actually an incarnation of Mulan, and all his comrades do not know that he is a girl.'" The poem was not written at the end, and the surname was missing, like a dragon without a tail, which the reader doubted. The person is a disciple of the Many Building Poetry, and I know her life experience well. There is a touching story of heroic children in it, but unfortunately it is submerged. Now I will describe it to prove that the old man's words are not false, and also to let people know that there is such a wonderful woman in the world.

The woman's surname is Zhou, and her name is taboo, for fear that it will be inconvenient in the army. She is from Luoyang. When she joined the army, she was eighteen years old, and now she is three years old. She was orphaned and miserable when she was young, and depended on her uncle. The family has a pair of swords, which the woman regards as a good companion. Every time she is sad, she gets up and dances, and the trees in the courtyard all whistle. After the dance, she is filled with emotion and tears. She is betrothed to Mr. Yan in the same village. When the Northeast was陷, Yan organized a volunteer army to go to the national disaster, and there was no news for a long time, or it was reported that he died in battle. The woman was overwhelmed with grief and was ill every day. One day, she suddenly realized and said: It is useless to be sad, and what is the use of dying, and there is no way to repay Mr. Yan. Then she dressed up, cut her hair, and carried her sword to join the army. The sword was engraved with: Poems and Swords. She wrote to me and said: If I cannot kill the enemy to succeed in life, I will kill myself to become benevolent after death. Her tragedy is like this. The woman is intelligent, brave and resolute, and her appearance is graceful and slender like an ancient beauty. She can write poetry, paint, and carve inscriptions. Even in the army, she has never failed to read books for a day.

The woman has no home, only a poem and a pair of swords, which she always carries with her. She once asked me to write on the eyebrow of the poem manuscript, and I signed it as: Collection of Poems and Swords from the Army. The collection includes: Riding iron horses in the night to chase demons in dreams, and blood flowers blooming on the robes in spring. Seeing that I miss her, she said: Last night, the dream of poetry in a small building was far away, and a cold moon sailed into Wusong. I cultivated myself as a disciple of Cui Lou Poetry, and I will never envy plum blossoms in this life. Also, the world is ashamed of fame and fortune. All can be chanted. (I have seen the rest in the News and Women's Semimonthly, so I will not repeat them.) She is sad about the sisters in the Many Building Poetry, and someone pities me for tears. It was written to Miss Jiang Yanan to express her feelings. Now Yanan's recruitment of wood is already done. Since Zhou left last autumn, there has been no news of her. Now I heard that a guest got her collection of poems after the disaster, and I am worried about her. I don't know if this female warrior is safe in the midst of the storm. Alas, she extends her love to the country, and guards the country with arms. She is truly a wonderful woman. It is enough to make cowards hear the wind and make up their minds.

I was so moved by her story that I once wrote a new Song of Everlasting Sorrow. Now I attach it below as a tribute:

The Great Wall is sent to ruin as if it were nothing, and the hatred of moth eyebrows is full of passes and mountains. The tears of Cangwu in 濸湘 for thousands of years, the wind and horse clouds go and never return. Daughters were born in the midst of war, and there is a unique spirit of Youyan in rouge. At the age of fifteen, they sang the songs of pearls and swords, and two lines of tiger armor bent their knives. In the hibiscus small garden, they teased the delicate horses, and their faces were covered with streamers. They shot willows and leaves full of moss steps, and hit orioles out of flower pavilions. Reluctant uncles and aunts pity loneliness and separation, and they have been tied up with girls since they were young. They cherish words and are shy when they are not married every year, and they always blush when people ask them. The pink man is gentle, elegant, brave, and martial. He learns swords, paints, and learns words. A small team of sheep carts selects beautiful jade, and the full building of red sleeves looks at the beautiful son-in-law. Deliberately preventing sisters from knowing, they are doubly reserved when they meet at ordinary times. The only way to show their deep affection is in a back glance. At this time, how can I say that this is a long-lasting hatred? In an instant, the beacon smoke spread the border alert. A man has a will to beg for a long strand, but there is nowhere to ask for a long rope. In addition, they form a volunteer group, and they will not return if they do not kill Lou Lan. They wave flags into clouds and sweat into rain, and the cheers and cries send them off to the sky. Unable to donate their lives to protect their wives and children, they agree with the covenant that you will plan for yourself. They say goodbye to their husbands with tears, and your words are so humble, but your intentions are firm. They promise to live and die and allow confidants. At sunset, the fish is drawn on the city head, and the pipa on horseback urges them to die. They cut off their clothes as a farewell and leave from now on, and the rolling yellow clouds ascend to the general's platform. They swear an oath in white clothes on the edge of the Yi River, and the rouge on the border closes its drum sounds. When the arrows are exhausted and the aid is cut off, they cry out, and those who are wounded are moved and those who fall rise up. They are invincible and their spirit is not peaceful. The sound of killing shakes the sky and the sky is frightened. The Huns are all happy at this time, and Li Guang was originally a scholar. The granary has been raising soldiers for a hundred years in vain, and no one has ever bothered to resist. But seeing the hot blood rushing, the volunteers, crisscrossed bones fill the wormwood, the deep boudoir is sad to the dawn this night, sitting and listening to the thunder gradually flatten, the empty stable escapes back to the masterless horse, the flat sand no longer has the Han family camp. They know that things have changed and emotions have changed, and they look forward to seeing each other after breaking the mirror. Bees shoot through the moon-watching tower, and wolf smoke blackens the flowery circle. Taboo to inquire about the news throughout the Northeast, and do not write poems about mandarin ducks but about swans. Hate stones like fists fill their chests, and a stroke of the Tartar flute cries for thousands of families. Originally, red powder is also heroic, and the ambition is the same from beginning to end. They take off all their hairpins and clouds of hair, and tear through thorns to join the army. Mulan gradually ages in the beacon dust, and after waking up, she sings sadly and smiles in her dream. In her dream, she wields a heroic sword to go down the Great Wall, and she sees Yan 郎 still with a jade face. When the country is broken and the family is destroyed, the grass and trees are new. This heart does not spring again, but it will use the intention of breaking and destroying the phoenix to make people roar like dragons and tigers. Diplomatic relations with neighbors are more important than beacons, and do not ask about the borders but about the rebels. On the stage, they are sad to hear the deer遊, and first sweep away the fox and raccoon house in the grass. The sea flows east for thousands of years of sorrow, and this hatred has turned leisurely for three years. The beauty hugs the golden cup alone in pain, and she cries when she talks about the dangerous city.

Talking

### A Tragic Accident Caused by Performing a Circus

— Luo Caiqing

Liyang Correspondence: A circus troupe came to Liyang to perform during the Lunar New Year holiday. They used the open space across the river in the East Park of the city as the venue and filed a record with the authorities. However, they could not pass without building a bridge across the river, so they hired carpenter Liu Changgao to contract the wood and wages, totaling 40 yuan. After the construction was completed, the construction department inspected it and started business immediately. For several days, the number of people who came to watch was endless. Unexpectedly, at about 11:00 a.m. on the 16th, the bridge suddenly broke in the middle due to the thin bridge planks and too many pedestrians. The bridge body also collapsed with it. More than 100 people fell into the water at one time...

I have not been to Liyang, so I have no way of knowing how wide the river separated by the East Park of the city and the open space is. However, according to the correspondence, it only cost 40 yuan to build a wooden bridge, including wood and wages, so the river must not be that wide. Otherwise, it is really suspicious that the technicians of the construction department of the county are all "brainless" if such a shoddy bridge surface can be inspected by the construction department. However, the wooden bridge was still shoddy after all. Isn't it because "the bridge planks were too thin and there were too many pedestrians" that "the bridge broke in the middle with a bang"? However, we cannot completely put the responsibility on the carpenter Liu Changgao. "The bridge planks were too thin" is certainly one of the major causes of the accident, but the minor cause is "too many pedestrians." When the construction department inspected the bridge, perhaps they did not think that the circus troupe had such a big appeal? Let's close our eyes and think about it. "More than 100 people" were crowded on a wooden bridge built for 40 yuan "including labor and materials" (calculated by the number of people who fell into the water, perhaps more than this number). The so-called "endless stream of people watching" is a fact, not a descriptive adjective. Extrapolating in this way, even if "the bridge planks are not thin," it is unlikely that it would not break! The "more than 100 people" who fell into the water are the same as the students who are good at making trouble and "accidentally fall into the water," which is "self-inflicted." Although "making trouble" and "watching a circus" are too inappropriate to compare.

However, those villagers are ultimately not as good as the students with knowledge. Look at the following paragraph of the correspondence: "A few villagers saw this and thought that the origin of the disaster was caused by the circus, and they tore the cloth tent to pieces..." The saying "blame the knife instead of the murderer" is probably the case. But how can you blame the murderer? Therefore, the correspondent finally wrote directly: "It is said that this circus performance in Liyang had a compromise with a certain organization, and the bridge was so flimsy, and no one cared about it, which caused this tragedy. All relevant parties should bear corresponding responsibility." I still copied the title of the news as the title of my article without changing a word: A Tragic Accident Caused by Performing a Circus!

### Brother and Sister

— Bai Gui

Ping and Li are a very close brother and sister, and they both have considerable jobs. However, every time they meet, Ping always sees that Li's teeth are a bit black and yellow, so he advises her to brush her teeth with good toothpaste.

After a long time, Ping and Li met, and saw that her teeth were still the same as before, so he asked her why she didn't listen to him.

According to Li, she has been brushing her teeth with toothpaste these days, and said that the toothpaste she uses is of the highest quality, because she saw a novel advertisement for this toothpaste in the newspaper. Ping listened to Li's words and said, "Don't believe those novel and flashy words anymore. The effectiveness of toothpaste is to whiten teeth, kill bacteria, strengthen gums, and protect enamel. Only "One Three One Toothpaste" supervised by pharmacists from the Wuzhou Pharmacy has such medicinal effects."

### Record of Saving Life

— Yi

I am writing this text, not to boast of my own merits, but to give others as a lesson:

I have a relative who came to Shanghai to find a job. He found a job, but because of his youth and just entering society, he was unfortunately seduced by prostitutes and contracted gonorrhea! And he was also deceived by that quack doctor, which delayed the treatment period and turned into a lingering chronic disease! When I knew about this and went to see him, he was already in great pain and his life was in danger! At that time, I asked him if he had taken "De Li Ping"? He said that he had not taken it, so I told him to buy it and take it quickly, and said to him, "'De Li Ping's' medicinal power can directly reach the lesion and completely destroy the gonococci. It may save your life at any moment." Later, his disease was really cured, and he was very grateful for my words.

### Snow

— Falling

The air in the metropolis is already filled with the breath of spring, and newspapers are telling us it's time to "seek plum blossoms." "Seeking plum blossoms" is an elegant affair, but even more elegant should be "trampling snow to seek plum blossoms"; thus, snow comes to mind.

It is said that snowfall before the start of spring is very beneficial for farming because it can kill the eggs of various pests hidden in the soil, so it is called "auspicious snow." But why doesn't spring snow have that power? To be honest, I don't know, or perhaps it's not "timely." In the city, however, there is no distinction between "auspicious snow" and "spring snow." For the poor, as long as it snows, they obediently prepare to "freeze and starve to death"; for the rich, all snow is worth appreciating, without knowing "auspicious snow" or "spring snow."

This year, Shanghai has only had two falls of snow pellets, none of which accumulated, which is a "regretful matter." Nanjing and other places actually have snow accumulation up to a foot deep, although it is "spring snow." However, precisely because it is "spring snow," the number of poets and literati "trampling snow to seek plum blossoms" has increased. According to reports from the Jinghu and Huhu-Yong lines, due to the crowding of passengers during the Spring Festival, three or four ordinary-class special trains will be added as usual to meet the needs.

During this Spring Festival, talking with friends, I also wanted to open the dock and, of course, temporarily impersonate an elegant person by "trampling snow to seek plum blossoms." However, travel requires funds, and "trampling snow to seek plum blossoms" even more requires preparing a large sum to be extorted. So, we just talked about it, and none of my friends left Shanghai.

Fortunately, I have a hanging scroll of "trampling snow to seek plum blossoms" at home, which I hung up during the Spring Festival as a wall decoration, also to enjoy a "reclining tour."

Surrounded by undulating peaks, the plain is a plum forest. An old man, wearing a red hood, rides a weak mule, just crossing a plank bridge. Because the snow on the mountain peak melts, it is diverted into the river, waiting to faintly hear the sound of flowing water. Behind the mule follows a page carrying a qin and holding a paper umbrella, following the hoof prints.

That "trampling snow to seek plum blossoms" is painted very exquisitely, but under my pen, there are only a few strokes, and it is not even one ten-thousandth as wonderful as the painting. For example, the old man seems to be cocking his ear and concentrating, perhaps searching his barren mind to recite a quatrain; and the page, wanting to seek plum blossoms but unable to

## Page 20

to leave the master too far, seems to have some hesitant steps.

Whether the elegant people of ancient times sought plum blossoms exactly like in the painting, no one can prove, but it can be guessed that they were a little more elegant than modern people. Modern people like to build those half-Chinese, half-Western villas on the edge of West Lake, which is evidence that they cannot be elegant. When they explore plum blossoms, they must drive a car straight to the end of the road, then change to a rattan sedan, puffing on cigars, and proceed all the way. Being able to support a stick and brave a muddy road for a while is already extremely elegant. On the way back, they all hang budding flower branches on the car or rattan sedan, preparing to bring them back and insert them in vases, while the lover plays the piano, and they sit on the velvet sofa by the stove, staring at the flower branches, also proclaiming themselves as comrades of Lin Hejing, which is a big joke.

Thinking of snow, I then thought of "seeking plum blossoms," unfortunately, the text does not match the theme, and a few hundred words slipped out. But "seeking plum blossoms" cannot be separated from "trampling snow," although "appreciating snow" is another matter.

Recently, a friend returned from beyond the customs (perhaps escaped) and gave me a very grand gift, which is a snow scene near Huangshanzi in Jilin. For those who live in the city and cannot "appreciate snow," it is naturally enough to provide the pleasure of "reclining tour." However, there is no plum forest in Jilin, otherwise, after this modern "trampling snow to seek plum blossoms" picture is reprinted in Shanghai, it could make a good business. Now, simply publish the plate to see the snow scene of our "vast land, abundant resources, and prosperous area." Because even if you prepare travel expenses, I am afraid you still cannot appreciate it, so this can be considered a "reclining tour."

### A Record of Global Air Travel (Part 2)

— Written by Dr. Falcouner of the United States, specially translated

At 3:30 PM that afternoon, I flew from Frankfurt to Amsterdam in the Netherlands, a distance of 285 miles, and arrived at 5:15 PM. A representative from the Royal Dutch Airlines was waiting at the airport to greet me. He led me to one of the largest hotels to settle in. In the following two days, he accompanied me to visit the best scenic spots in the Netherlands and to see the world's largest cheese market and the cottage where Emperor Peter the Great of Russia lived when he studied shipbuilding in the Netherlands as a youth. The hotel and other expenses were paid for by the company, and I was given two traveling suitcases as gifts. At 6:00 AM on May 16th, I boarded the company's aircraft, the Wood Pigeon, for a long-distance flight from Amsterdam to Penang, Straits Settlements of the United States. The aircraft was a Douglas model from the United States. In the United States, this type of aircraft usually carries 14 passengers. This time, for the long flight, only eight seats were set up so that passengers would have room to rest and sleep.

We departed at 6:00 AM and arrived at Athens, the capital of Greece, at 5:15 PM, flying 14125 miles. We made short stops in Leipzig, Bratislava, and Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia. After spending the night in Athens, we departed again at 6:00 AM the next morning and arrived at Baolian at 6:45 PM, flying 1979 miles. We made short stops in Alexandria, Cairo, and Gaza. We also flew over the Jordan River, Bethlehem (the birthplace of Jesus), the holy land of Jerusalem, and other famous places in the Bible on a clear night. That day, we flew over three continents: Europe, Africa, and Asia, and dined in three of the world's most famous cities. Breakfast was in Athens, the capital of Greece, lunch was in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, and dinner was in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq. We stayed at the Riverside Hotel by the Euphrates River. The next day, at 1:45 AM, we got up in a hurry. The bell rang three times, and we soared into the sky again. At 7:15 PM, we arrived at Yottpo. We flew all day that day, covering a total of 1962 miles.

We continued our departure at 5:00 AM the next morning, and at 5:15 PM, we arrived in Yangon, a distance of 1678 miles. We made short stops in Allahabad and Calcutta in India, and flew over the famous Ganges Delta, seeing the river water gushing into the Bay of Bengal through a dense network of outlets. At 5:30 AM the next morning, we departed from Yangon and made a brief stop in Bangkok, the capital of Siam. At 11:00 AM, we arrived at our destination, Penang, having flown 976 miles. Penang is the end point of the Royal Dutch Airlines line. To go further, we had to transfer to an aircraft of the Imperial Airways. Due to waiting for the connecting flight, we stayed in Penang for five days, from May 20th to 25th. Penang was the first place where the British community in the Straits Settlements gathered, and the scenery is excellent, so I felt very pleasant during my five days of residence. At 6:00 AM on May 25th, we departed on the Imperial Airways' Durado airship. I was the only passenger in the ship. After flying 750 miles, we spent the night in Dorlan, French Annam. At 6:00 AM the next morning, we flew to Hong Kong, a distance of 650 miles, and arrived at 11:00 AM on May 26th.

When I arrived in Hong Kong, I learned that I would have to wait at least five months for Pan American Airways to start carrying passengers. (Editor's note: According to a New York dispatch on February 15th, Pan American Airways has announced that the Pacific regular air service from San Francisco to Hong Kong is tentatively scheduled to open on March 24th of this year.) So, I decided to use this time to travel to the Philippines, Japan, and China. I stayed in each place for about seven weeks, feeling that each place had its own unique beauty. I also stayed in Korea, Manchuria, and Rehe for a week. At 2:11 AM on October 31st, near Cavite Port in Manila, I boarded the Hawaiian Clipper flying to Honolulu. There were a total of ten passengers traveling with me, including three women. This was the first commercial flight departing from the Philippines. The moon was bright in the sky at night, and it was lovely. At 4:38 PM, we arrived at Guam Island and stayed overnight at the hotel established by Pan American Airways. Around 9:00 PM, I felt a strong earthquake. The next morning at 5:52 AM, we continued to Wake Island, a distance of 1506 miles. Not long after departure, we received a radio message reporting that Guam Island had been severely damaged by the earthquake.

### Supper

— Luo Yu

In the middle of those lush, boundless bald mountains, two flat steel rails stretched straight toward the east. On the telegraph wires, buzzing in the spring breeze, gray wild pigeons perched like musical notes, shrinking their small heads and cleverly dodging the gusts.

Ahead were boulders cleared like gums, creating an open path on both sides. In the far distance, blocky little houses like goose-down绒 hid behind the hillside. The stout first section of the railway resembled a slave wearing a red scarf, burdened with a heavy load.

From a small white house nearby walked a hunched figure, waving red and green flags. From that station came the last train of the afternoon.

These were three dilapidated passenger cars, lazily traveling. In those cars sat sparse passengers who looked like workers and small merchants. The workers' faces were full of oil and sweat. Black and shiny hands held the backs of chairs or gripped cigarettes. The rattling windows cast a layer of dim light, refracting the red of the mountains. The sun nestled close to the western mountain peak.

A new worker, still a child, sat on a chair with his head lowered. He stared unblinkingly at the empty lunchbox. His lunch (a dish of pickles, a bucket of rice, and a boiled egg) had been stolen. The faces of his colleagues were unfamiliar, indifferent. The afternoon's work was done with an empty stomach. His nose filled with the smell of oil, and his empty stomach could not suppress the urge to vomit several times.

He tasted this unfair humiliation for the first time. Beneath the half-sunken eye sockets, the buds of resentment grew. The round cheeks drooped, and the lips became unnaturally stubborn.

His stomach rumbled wave after wave. The shaking of the car made him dizzy.

The workers each occupied a chair, legs spread or sprawled on the armrests. The coarse tones of the small merchants at the corners of the chairs matched the rattling of the car. A worker hummed softly a popular tune from Jiaohe Town. Everything collided with unfamiliarity. Everything revealed a bad irony.

As usual, the train stopped at the platform with two rows of whitewashed workshops, briefly imitating a quarrel with a Guan Dong accent. It was all pretense. They gave the oil-smeared people some comfort and earned an equal amount of respect.

The new worker, a teenager in oversized dark blue trousers, staggered. He was very short, moving toward the last tongues of fire of the sun.

He had only run away with his mother this recent autumn. The mother, when she first arrived, hated everything, but soon found her mahjong partners and peacefully made up her mind to live. The father was like a worn-out horse, and every evening, he drank a small pot of shochu.

Jiaohe was a cluster of town houses lying at the foot of the mountain. It was precipitous. The evening wind galloped on the rooftops. They spent a disastrous winter here.

When the short worker walked into that small courtyard, there was a woman, about forty years old, holding a piece of firewood, hitting a child no more than ten years old. The child's head was pitifully large. The child's neck was terribly thin. He cried while uttering rambling nonsense. This scene was common. He felt that the piece of firewood was falling on his own flesh, one blow after another. He clearly felt a surge of humiliation.

"Mom! Let me pour, let me pour." He shouted non-stop, immediately put down the lunchbox, picked up the bucket next to him, and ran out into the street.

The room was dark and dim. A small pit table was placed on the narrow plank kang, with two cold dishes sitting motionless there. A long-faced, middle-aged man wearing a woolen railway uniform sat on the ground by the table, quietly drinking wine. The faint aroma teased the tip of his nose. He did not eat mouthfuls of rice, but pecked at small beans like a waterfowl.

Before long, the big child with the oily black face walked into the room. The mother flicked on a sesame-seed-like light; she was seized by a string of resentful gasps. She then turned to that round face, seeing two crystal tears flowing onto the black urn-like skin.

### Dusk

— Shen Bing

I stood before the half-covered window, my fingers stained yellow by the waning sunlight, and wearily squinted as I looked out. A spiderweb, woven horizontally in the corner of the low wall, suddenly broke and scattered. A black insect hung in the void, swinging as if suspended on a swing. Dust remained silent, in this ancient dusk. The eaves of the roof quietly brushed against the melancholy twilight.

From the rafters to the paving stones below, the twilight spread quietly with the wings of a swallow, landing within the low enclosing wall, quivering slightly like the membranous wings of a dragonfly just perched on a leaf. Thus, in the narrow courtyard, the night air formed a gentle, quiet wave like lake water. The vastness was slightly tinged with blue.

The tired birds hid their heads among their feathers, gripping the branches with one red toe as they stood, seeking rest for the night. Occasionally, a hawk that had come from afar chirped once, drawing a black arc of lightning across the vast sky. But the gentle, quiet wave stagnated and diffused.

Evening clouds lingered in the gloomy sky, drifting and blowing, gradually pressing down toward the corner of the yard. In the courtyard, the neighbor's children picked up their bamboo knives and wooden horses and went home. A young woman carried a kerosene lamp and, using the last rays of the setting sun, added kerosene oil. Her deeply laced waist slowly straightened up again; a rickshaw puller, just returning from outside, was counting the money he had poured out from his waist. A mouthful of sharp-edged laughter flashed across his extremely rugged face. Night was coming.

The twilight blurred the window, and the kerosene lamp could not illuminate it. It was as if someone had pulled curtains over the window.

Like a broken-down wreck, abandoned in the wilderness, the kerosene lamp stank, the water was dry, and I awaited a hint of blue mountains in the black mist. I suspected I was bearing the dusk.

Consort Yang is drunk in the Agarwood Pavilion. High lanterns are lit, waiting for the monarch. Eunuch Gao kneels at the palace wall. This servant has something to report to the imperial consort. His Majesty has visited Chaoyang Courtyard and cannot return to the palace wall tonight. The imperial consort hears this and feels dejected. She hastily tells the maids to remove her palace attire. She leans against the dragon bed in her clothes. She sighs and sheds tears. It has been said since ancient times that beauty is often ill-fated. Persuade people not to value the monarch. It is better to marry a romantic hero. To enjoy joy and music from dawn till dusk. Who is there to keep me company alone in the West Palace? Crepe myrtle flowers face crepe myrtle gentleman.

### Storytelling

Cao Xiaoying "Jade Dragonfly"

Zhongxi (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM

Opening: "Scholar Lin"

A corner of Lonely Mountain is green on the lake, with three hundred species of plum blossoms forming a forest. What a scholar, Lin Bufu, with a pure and distant mind. He willingly lives in a bamboo fence and thatched cottage, unpolluted by even a trace of worldly affairs. Not only is he fond of learning and never seeks officialdom, but for twenty years his feet have not stepped into the city. Plum blossoms are his wife and his little cranes are his sons. It can be seen that his iron heart and proud bones are innate. In the cold weather, cranes guard the plum blossoms. It seems that Xuan Shi (another name of Lin Bufu) is dutifully serving his mother. Plum blossoms blush. Cranes sing in the shade. One is the smiling face of a goddess from Guye Mountain. The other is the light and pure reading sound of a young phoenix. Occasionally, a distinguished guest visits the mountain temple. His slave boy releases the phoenix into the blue clouds. Only to see them dancing gracefully to welcome the master. The gentleman is returning home in a small boat. He is even better than Tao Qian, who hires a son to wait by the firewood gate. He is skilled in calligraphy and painting and loves to chant poems. He says there is no need for world-famous manuscripts to be preserved. However, the sparse shadows slant across the clear and shallow water. The subtle fragrance floats in the moonlight. These beautiful lines have been passed down to this day. Later, the emperor bestowed silk and grain. He also changed his name to Hejing, calling himself Mr. Hejing. He leaves behind a high and noble name. It is said that Maoling will one day seek his posthumous manuscripts. Fortunately, there were no Fengshan texts. It can be seen that the romantic and unrestrained Sima Xiangru cared little about fame.

Movie

### "Song at Midnight" Premieres Today

The terrifying blockbuster "Song at Midnight," filled with bewildering mysteries and dazzling wonders, is a rare gem of the film world and the pioneer of domestic horror films. Director Ma Xuweibang's skills are truly outstanding. Because of sufficient technical preparation, the results are exceptionally superior and indescribable. Although the plot is bizarre, it satirizes society everywhere, shakes people's hearts, and reaches a peak. The cast is also extraordinarily impressive. The leading actors, such as Hu Ping, Jin Shan, and Shi Chao, are all famous generals on the silver screen and stage. Jin Shan plays the monster, with terrifying makeup, and his acting skills are also superb. There are three songs in the film, written by the great playwright Tian Han, which are extraordinary. The film premieres today at the Jincheng Theater, and movie fans should be the first to see it.

### Minxin News

The interior scenes of "New Humanity" have been fully completed in the past few days, and the crew will soon depart for Qingjiangpu to shoot exterior scenes.

"The Gate of Flesh and Spirit" has been completely finished. It was screened at the Jincheng Grand Theater yesterday, and the results were exceptionally brilliant. The play depicts the struggle between spirit and flesh, the conflict between love and hate, the battle between benevolence and violence, and the fight between good and evil. Every inch is tearful, and every foot is bloody. Those who attended the screening praised it as the most magnificent, most sacred, and most beautiful domestic film.

"The Mysterious Female Detective," directed by Ren Pengnian, has already started filming. The female lead is Wu Lizhu, the male lead is Peng Fei, and the villain lead is Wen Rong.

Liang Saizhu, who plays the role of Liu Xiyi in "New Humanity," is not only extremely diligent in her acting but also able to provide the company with various benefits beyond the contract in her work, making Minxin and its collaborators feel satisfied. According to director Bu Wancang, Liang Saizhu's excellent performance has added a lot of color to "New Humanity."

The "New Humanity" special single-volume publication is currently in preparation. Lin Chuchu, Li Keng, Hu Rong, Liang Saizhu, Wang Guilin, Dai Yanwan, Li Junpan, and Xu Kunwu have all accepted the editorial department's invitation to write articles. Some parts have already been submitted, and Bu Wancang's "Words from the Director" is currently being written.

### Cathay Screens "Pennies From Heaven"

The Unprecedented Work of the King of Song, Bing Crosby

Columbia Pictures can be said to be the maker of stars. Why do we say that? You see, Grace Moore suddenly rose to fame and became famous in the film industry because she starred in the company's "One Night of Love." Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable received awards from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for their joint performance in the company's "It Happened One Night." Now, Bing Crosby, the king of song, has achieved great success and further enhanced his reputation for starring in this company's "Pennies From Heaven." This film not only has touching songs with many variations, but the humor and poignancy of the story are also rare. The supporting cast includes the beautiful star Marge Evans and Edith Fellows, the "little bird" in "The Secret of the Secretary," making it a perfect match and impeccable. The film will be released at the Cathay Grand Theater starting today. In order to please the audience, the theater will also specially screen the valuable short film, a Technicolor cartoon, "The Lovelorn Birds."

### "Our Children's Drama Club" Tea Party Cancelled

"Our Children's Drama Club" originally planned to hold a tea party for members this Sunday afternoon and intended to perform a "shadow play" and sing other entertainment activities for its first recruitment of members. However, due to non-compliance with procedures, the club has now cancelled the event.
