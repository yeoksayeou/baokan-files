### Chiang Kai-shek's Broadcast Speech on the Third Anniversary of the New Life Movement (Continued from Yesterday)

㊀ Implement it conscientiously, do not engage in extravagance. We must have the spirit of "seeking truth from facts" in promoting the New Life Movement. It must be understood that the New Life Movement is a social movement, and it should be done with the spirit of engaging in social movements, not with the methods of doing political work, and even less should it be done with official boilerplate like "as per instructions" to go through the motions. It must be understood that the work of changing customs and habits cannot be done with a mere piece of paper. It must be done conscientiously to achieve real results. I have seen the publications of New Life Movement associations in various places, and most of them are official letters, meeting minutes, and speeches, while the records of work achievements are few. This is all evidence of not bringing out the spirit of "seeking truth from facts" and not being serious in doing things. In the past, there were more slogans and less work in the promotion, more plans and less implementation. In terms of promotion targets, attention was only paid to the upper layers of society and not to the lower layers, only to the main roads and not to the streets and alleys. Therefore, the results of the New Life Movement in the past three years have only achieved a temporary update on the surface, and have not achieved a permanent and thorough reform. From now on, those of us who are doing the work of the New Life Movement must pay attention to the actual improvement of the lives of the general public, do less cosmetic publicity, take the family as the starting point for promoting the New Life Movement, take the countryside as the center for promoting the New Life Movement, and take the general public as the target. Set an example, implement the New Life Movement ourselves first, and then persuade others. Then the effect of the work will surely be broad and rapid. If we only use posting slogans and writing official documents as promoting the New Life Movement, then the future of the New Life Movement is self-evident.

㊁ Concentrate strength and implement it thoroughly. The purpose of the New Life Movement is to revitalize the nation. The responsibility is great and the scope is broad. Of course, it is not something that we can do in three days or two. Therefore, in the steps of promotion, we must go from near to far, from shallow to deep. For example, if we can do the initial work of "orderliness" and "cleanliness" thoroughly throughout the country, then we will have made a lot of contributions to the movement of national revitalization. Therefore, in the future, we must choose a central task, implement it conscientiously, and not be too ambitious, which will result in doing everything but doing nothing well. Many of the plans and methods in the past have made this mistake. On the surface, they are very thorough, but in fact, nothing can be done. In the future, we must strive to change this drawback, choose a central task, divide the steps, implement them on schedule, and concentrate our strength to achieve our goals.

(3) Setting an Example and Extending to Others. All those who do the work of social mobilization must have a great personality and the power to use sincerity to influence others. Therefore, the promotion of the New Life Movement relies very little on the power of politics, but must be done by everyone setting an example and using the effort of "silent transformation." Because laws can only tell people not to do bad things, but cannot encourage people to do good things. If we want to change customs and habits, we must have the power of social sanctions and methods of spiritual infusion in order to be effective. Otherwise, why didn't we use government orders to enforce it at the beginning of the New Life Movement, but instead focused on the self-cultivation of the leaders, and used the method of "silent transformation" to extend it to others? The accumulated habits of society have been left over for thousands of years, and it is naturally not easy to change them. Therefore, we must use sincerity to influence them, so that "even metal and stone can be opened." If we do not implement the New Life Movement ourselves, but insist that others implement the New Life Movement, then we lack sincerity, and nothing is more hypocritical and ugly than this.

(4) Simplicity and Frugality, Consistency between Appearance and Reality. "Simplicity" and "frugality" are two important principles of the New Life Movement, and also the basis for implementing labor and thrift. The opposite of simplicity and frugality is extravagance and waste, which is absolutely harmful to nation-building work. Now, in any country that is building the nation with hardship, the government and society, from top to bottom, are united in taking frugality as the foundation and simplicity and frugality as the goal, so that they can save useful material resources, time resources, and human resources to save the country. At the beginning of the New Life Movement, everyone was able to pay attention to this point. For example, banquets not only set a time, but also advocated thrift and tried to avoid waste. But soon it returned to the previous state, with too much food, too much waste, and everything was unlimited, wasting time and energy, which is so regrettable. Everyone may think that this is a trivial matter, but we must know that if we want to build a modern country, we must start with small things in everything. Everything is accumulated from small things, from small to large, and from knowing the great way of revolutionary nation-building, so we know but do not act, or act but not for long, and often only do the surface. When I was studying abroad, I personally saw that foreign college students came out in the morning to sell newspapers and deliver milk, and studied during the day. Not only could they use this to subsidize their tuition and develop a foundation for self-reliance, but they also developed the habit of doing things in detail and practicing frugality. I really feel very envious of this, and this is what our Chinese students should also emulate. For example, young people in Germany often do the work of collecting waste paper, rags, and iron scraps themselves, collecting all the minute and useless items, using them for processing and storage as materials for material construction. In Chinese families, wherever it is hidden, there is waste paper everywhere, dirty and scattered, and no attention is paid to it. For example, all the larger roads in Nanjing seem to be very clean on the surface, but if you look carefully at the sides of the roads or in the streets and alleys, you can often find piles of scattered paper scraps, cloth strips, and garbage in front of the doors. The same is often true in schools, and even the blackboard in the classroom is not wiped by anyone, perfunctory and lazy, as if they do not see it. What kind of cleanliness and labor is this? For example, in terms of clothing, many students wear uniforms but wear their hats askew or leave their shirts exposed outside their uniforms, which is worse than not wearing uniforms at all. Moreover, they have lost the original meaning of wearing uniforms, and there is absolutely no question of neatness, etiquette, or appearance. This is just an example of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. There are countless other lifestyles that are not in line with the times. This kind of inconsistency between appearance and reality and constant awkwardness are all due to a misunderstanding of the purpose of the New Life Movement and a failure to connect the New Life Movement with the methods of saving the country. We must truly establish a new atmosphere, save the country, and build the nation, and we must vigorously practice simplicity, frugality, and do it thoroughly, inside and out, from beginning to end.

㊄ Sincerity and Enthusiasm, Self-Improvement and Unceasing Effort. We especially want to put this forward to encourage all those responsible for promoting the New Life Movement. In this year's work, we must achieve these two pieces of advice. I have said before that we have two major shortcomings in our habits in the past, which are the main reasons why our cause has not progressed and caught up with the great powers. The first is a lack of spirit and enthusiasm, and the second is a lack of continuous spirit. Because it does not originate from sincerity, although it is very tense at the beginning, it will inevitably become slack after a while. In everything, we only seek to deal with the past and do not seek actual results, so foreigners ridicule us for only having three minutes of heat. Also, because we lack enthusiastic emotions, we feel uninspired by anything. Although it is not intentional laziness, we ultimately cannot muster the courage to move forward vigorously, and the result is inevitably close to going through the motions. As for the second point, if we lack the spirit of continuous self-improvement and unceasing effort, not only will our progress be slow, but our existing achievements will often not be maintained. Therefore, the ancients said that we should "renew ourselves daily" and "strive for perfection." These two maxims are the true spirit of the New Life Movement. Although I have said these words last year, I think they are extremely important, so I will put them forward again to encourage everyone. The above points are my contributions to those responsible for promoting the New Life Movement, and they have a great relationship with our general public. We must know that "the rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every man." Now that the national crisis has reached its final and serious juncture, if not everyone takes on the responsibility of saving the country, seeking survival, and revitalizing the nation, then the country will have much less hope, and the date of national revitalization will be delayed because of it. The purpose of the New Life Movement is to fully express the four dimensions of propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame in everyone's food, clothing, housing, and transportation, and to implement it unremittingly, so that our individuals and society can renew themselves daily in the four aspects of morality, intelligence, physical fitness, and community, morality can become more and more noble, knowledge can increase day by day, physical fitness can become stronger and stronger, and the spirit of unity, cooperation, and mutual assistance can increase day by day. Not only individuals, but also the whole society and the people of the whole country can be like this, and then our country can be fundamentally saved, and our nation will surely be revived. Now that we have recognized that the New Life Movement is the only way to revitalize the nation, then every one of our citizens should conscientiously implement the New Life Movement, conscientiously promote the New Life Movement, go from small to large, extend it to others, and reach the point of renewing ourselves daily. I hope that our compatriots will no longer wait and see from today, make a resolution, and work hard to lay the foundation for the revitalization of the nation. (Central News Agency telegram, 19th)

Alas, the time of mourning has passed." He's couplet read, "Borrowing from the praise of the central authorities, secret and meticulous planning relates to the most important plans," and "Comrades support the building, and good friends are lost in the midst of hardship and danger." The funeral committee decided that on the morning of the 21st at 10 a.m., the body would be moved from the Renxiao Funeral Home to Pilo Temple.

### Going to Bailingmiao

— Our Reporter Qian Hua

A hundred miles of uninhabited Mongolian grassland. The life of soldiers on the ice and snow front line beyond the Great Wall

The slogan "National Defense First" is popular in various countries now, and the trendy Chinese are naturally following suit, shouting it loudly. Since the Suiyuan War began, the call for national defense construction has permeated the country, and batches of慰勞 inspection groups have flooded into Suiyuan like huge waves. News reporters who specialize in following the crowd are even less of an exception. As a result, the long-silent ancient city of Guihua has unexpectedly regained its prosperity, and the so-called national defense communications have also been scattered in newspapers and magazines, becoming first-class contemporary articles. I had long thought of going to the war zone to sightseeing and join in the fun, but official and private matters gathered,

It was not until January 13th that I was able to make the trip. I took the Huping train north, transferred to the Pingsui Road to Suiyuan, and then went to Bailingmiao and other places. I stayed in Tianjin, Beiping, Zhangjiakou, Datong, Pingdiquan, Baotou, and other places along the way. I returned to Shanghai on February 5th. The time spent inspecting in various places ranged from a few hours to no more than five or six days. How can we talk about observation in such a whirlwind trip? Fortunately, friends along the way provided many interesting materials, and there were unexpected gains in the car and旅邸. Combined with the on-the-spot inspections, I have recorded some fragments. Readers who care about the national defense front line may find it a bit interesting.

㊀ Northwest Military Fortress

Bailingmiao is located on the north side of Yinshan, 330 miles away from Guihua City and 240 miles away from Wuchuan County. It can be reached by car in one day. It is located on the Mongolian Plateau, with an altitude of about 2,000 meters. Its terrain is surrounded by mountains, with a plain in the middle. The hills are surrounded, and the clear streams meander around. The mountains are steep and majestic, easy to defend and difficult to attack. Since the fall of Rehe and the loss of the six counties in Chahar, Suiyuan has become a barrier for the northwestern provinces, shielding Shanxi and Shaanxi. If Suiyuan is not defended, Qin and Jin will not be ours, and the entire northwest will be in even greater danger. Judging from the terrain of Suiyuan, the Yinshan Mountains stretch across the central part of the province, forming a natural Great Wall, and Bailingmiao is the protection of Yinshan. If Bailingmiao is in the hands of the enemy, Suiyuan will be threatened by others at all times. The front can peek at Wuchuan, cross Yinshan, and directly attack Guihua; the side can harass Guyang, take Baotou, and撫 my back, making our army unable to take care of each other from beginning to end. In fact, Bailingmiao has become the only military fortress in the northwest today. Chairman Jiang solemnly stated: "The recovery of Bailingmiao is the starting point for the revival of our nation and the biggest key to our safety." This statement not only refers to the national spirit, but also contains significant meaning in terms of marching terrain. Geographer Zhang Qiyun published an article on the military geography of Suiyuan Province in China's New Theory, explaining the special importance of Bailingmiao's terrain, which is very insightful on national defense construction. He said: "The Yinshan Mountains were the border between China and the Huns during the Qin and Han Dynasties. The modern Suiyuan Province has both the front and back of the mountains. This is where the current national situation is different from the past. Therefore, the current military fortress must be moved northward. In the past, Sai Xian勒铭燕然, and Yanran was the Hangai Mountain. Military preparations were made in the Hangai Mountain area of Outer Mongolia. This could still be done in the early years of the Republic of China, but today the responsibility of the national army is to firmly defend the Mongolian Plateau within Suiyuan. There are many plains between the Yellow River and the Huai River. Only the small mountains near Xuzhou are sparse and are places that soldiers must contend for. The importance of Bailingmiao's terrain is also the reason. The hills around it undulate for nine seats, like a city. The Baili River flows through it, and the east of the river is the market street, which is where Han and Mongolian trade is located. The west of the river is a lama temple, and there are dozens of Mongolian yurts on the side of the temple. In the past, the Mongolian Local Autonomous Political Committee worked here. Bailingmiao is a major transportation route in the northwest. Internally, please take a route through Wuchuan to Guisui, and another route through Guyang to Baotou; externally, one route leads to Outer Mongolia, and the other route leads to Xinjiang. Therefore, the significance of the recovery of Bailingmiao this time is extraordinary. Therefore, we can eliminate the threat of foreigners to northern Suiyuan and cut off their westward path. We hope that the national army will build an extremely solid military fortress here to permanently eliminate the desire to peep. However, the terrain of the Mongolian Plateau is flat and easy, and trees are rare. Aircraft surveillance is very clear. I hope that our air force will take on the responsibility of defending the airspace." (To be continued)

### The Prelude to the War of Resistance

— Ye Gongchao

We don't need prophets to speculate, and we don't have to expect that the land we lost without a fight after "September 18" will not fall into the hands of others without a fight, let alone be returned to us without a fight. In other words, we will not be able to recover an inch of lost land without war in the future, and we will not be able to save our 30 million compatriots in dire straits without war. Recently, discussions in various parts of the country have clearly told us that the people of the whole country have now recognized this point. Even the separatists and speculators can only use the slogan of "unanimous foreign resistance" to do the trick of "catching fish in troubled waters". The government has not had any facts to resist insult in the past six years, but it can still gain the support of the general public, precisely because the people believe that the government is actively building basic defense work, believe that the government is determined to recover lost land, and believe that it will not abandon an inch of land again in the "September 18" style in the future. This ray of hope to resist insult has affected our attitude in all aspects. Our ideal political or economic system, the talents of our ideal leader, and even what we usually yearn for, such as "freedom of thought" and "equal opportunities", can all be temporarily put down at this time, under the conditions of preparing to resist the enemy and recover lost land. Today, theories, philosophies, and doctrines should all be put back in their place. This is not simplification of thought, but the price of urgent survival. We hope that the government understands why the people support it and obey it in times of emergency, and we also hope that Mr. Chiang Kai-shek will think about why everyone (including many non-hero worshippers) is so concerned about his safety and supports his rule. At the same time, we also hope that the party and country officials will pay attention: After "September 18", the people's feelings towards the Nanjing government have only recently begun to gradually improve, because the general public with a little knowledge and no background seems to feel that the government has indeed made considerable progress recently. This success is directly proportional to our hope of resisting insult; the War of Resistance is the only hope for the survival of our nation, and for the government and the Kuomintang, this is the only way out.

Many people think that our combat power will never reach the level of resisting the enemy: we are preparing, and others are of course preparing, and our rate may not be much faster than theirs, so we must actually borrow external force to contain the enemy. Therefore, some people advocate allying with Russia, some advocate begging for mercy from Britain and the United States, some advocate allying with Japan or being pro-Japanese as a fundamental solution, and even today there are still people who advocate waiting for the League of Nations to rise again. In the eyes of experts, I believe these claims have their own complexity, but here we don't seem to need to borrow the knowledge of experts. We can use a few common sense principles to review them. We all know that in international relations, whenever the word "alliance" is used, and its need is not in the relationship between each other, but in dealing with a third country together, both sides must be able to help each other under the principle of respecting each other's sovereignty, such as the alliance between France and Russia against Germany, and the alliance between Japan and Germany against Russia. At the same time, if allied countries want to maintain the spirit of mutual assistance, their strength should be similar; otherwise, one country must be in a protected position, and as a result, both sides cannot stand on an equal footing, and there does not seem to be a free guard method in the international community. Can the situation between China and Japan or China and Russia meet these conditions for mutual assistance? Simply put, our current strength is not enough to ally with Japan, nor is it enough to ally with Russia. Even if we need to ally with Japan or Russia, we must first be qualified to ally with people or be allied with people. As for being pro-Japanese, that is simply not a solution, and we can only oppose it to the end. Whether the international community can "rise again" is something we non-experts dare not speculate; however, even if its head is raised, I personally doubt how much practical help it can give us. If there is another investigation team, we will at most spend another one or two million on recruitment fees and preparation fees. They will of course make another report. Our experts can get hundreds or thousands more of these more accurate numbers, and intellectuals can publish a few more papers. Besides that, I dare say that everything will remain the same. The three northeastern provinces are still in the hands of others, and the special zone in the gray dream is still only continuing to "clarify". A famous British journalist said it well, the League of Nations has become a refrigerator for international problems. We Chinese should especially appreciate this! Britain and the United States each have their own interests in the Far East, and each has its own concerns. Of course, they are quite wary of any country that conflicts with their interests and their power. If someone is calculating Britain's colonies, Britain will of course defend itself; if someone wants to control China's market, and Britain already has a considerable commercial base in China, the British will of course think of ways. Their methods may be of direct or indirect benefit to us, or we may be able to stop under someone else's eaves to avoid the wind and rain for a while. However, we must not forget that Britain is a mature and prudent country. Although it may sometimes be fooled by Europeans, it is not as concerned about China as it is about India; and any aggressor against China, as long as it guarantees that it will never develop towards its colonies, how can we not know that under considerable circumstances, it will not form a "gentleman's agreement" or similar agreement with this aggressor against us? For example, if Japan decides to promote its continental policy and unconditionally abandon its maritime policy, we have no confidence in how Britain will treat it.

There is no need to say these obvious words, just because our own strength is indeed weak, and the aggressor's minions are really fierce, many compatriots cannot avoid having all kinds of excessive奢望. The greater the奢望 in diplomacy, the lower our self-confidence; the lower the self-confidence, the more difficult it is to achieve unification and resist the enemy. Diplomacy is of course necessary, because facts tell us that any two-country war in the future has the potential to trigger a world war. Moreover, the battle lines on both sides have already formed, and we seem to have to prepare to join one side. However, with our current strength, neither side will welcome us, unless we are willing to be slaves to others, or eternal "Chinese workers". We can only bury our heads and work hard to build our strength, prepare ourselves, and when the time is right, start the fighting force, and at the same time gradually make people feel that we are not a country without any strength. Our current problem is not which country to ally with, but how to build considerable strength in the shortest period of time. With considerable strength, we have our own diplomacy; without the backing of considerable strength, our diplomacy is just like what Napoleon said: "A blackmail tool for those who want to invade, and an organ for those who are invaded to beg for peace." Recently, some people think that if so-and-so is appointed as the diplomat, we will have great hope of allying with Russia or Japan. This kind of thinking is as naive and simple as when Mr. Jiang was detained in Xi'an, many anesthetized youths thought that as long as Chiang Kai-shek was resolved, we could immediately resist the enemy.

Since we have identified our way out, we must think about how we can survive from now until the day of the frontal conflict; not only survive, but also prepare and build. We advocate resisting the war for survival and for recovering lost land, not for a moment of excitement, regardless of everything, to fight the enemy. The so-called slogan of "scorched earth resistance" can only be used to express our determination to prepare for the war, but it cannot be used as a proposition, let alone a method. Although we do not seek to win, we should at least avoid the ending of the whole country turning into scorched earth. When we talk about war, we are of course referring to a large-scale modern war, the mobilization of the whole country, not just street fighting, hand-to-hand combat, and contact. If the environment allows us, we hope to prepare at least the ability to continue fighting for half a year. However, whether the enemy and our own internal forces allow us to do this is a problem that needs to be prepared for. In other words, on the one hand, we must have the freedom to build and prepare, and on the other hand, we must always be prepared to deal with the enemy's gradual division, sabotage, incitement, and all other soft aggressive means. The enemy wants to get something for nothing, because he has already tasted the sweetness. His most economical method of aggression is to disrupt our steps, incite us, and use our poverty and lack of national concept to cause riots or panic within us, so as to give him an excuse to seize the opportunity. If we do not give him any such opportunity, whether he is willing to take other methods with sacrifice conditions is not inevitable in the eyes of many people. We believe that from now until the time when both sides do not hesitate to have a frontal conflict, there is still a period of緩和 with each other. 緩和 is of course a relative term, and in fact it is a period when the enemy implements soft aggression and we endure the pain to deal with it.

But enduring pain without a plan is just the ability of a slave. In order to cope with the situation in this transitional period, we hope that the government will quickly decide on a comprehensive approach to the current situation. Rather than gradually specializing locally, it is better to think in advance: which places can be temporarily abandoned, and which places we absolutely cannot give way; where is our lowest lifeline, and where is our highest point of tolerance. It is precisely because we have identified the direction and set the goal that we are willing to endure the current small節. Tolerance is of course a last resort and a shame in personal feeling, but we only have this way to get through the current situation. Some people may ask: When will we tolerate it? This cannot be answered. We certainly do not know the future, and we do not know our current strength. The military secrets of any country cannot be publicly reported to its citizens. At present, we ordinary people can only completely trust the government, and at the same time, a government that is not built on the rock of public opinion cannot last long.

### Japan Plans to Send Economic Envoys to China

Kenji Kodama to Head Investigation Group; Some Say Each Individual Will Come Alone

[Tokyo] After the establishment of the Hayashi Cabinet, Japanese diplomacy first changed its previous attitude and decided to base itself on economic diplomacy. The specific work is to send economic envoys to China to reciprocate the Chinese economic inspection group that came to Japan in the autumn of the year before last. This plan has been officially decided, and the delegation is scheduled to leave Japan for China on March 12. The main purpose of the inspection group is to reciprocate the Japan-China Trade Association. It is organized by the Japanese members of the association, and Kenji Kodama, the general manager of the former Zhengjin Bank, who is well-versed in the situation in China and whose credit in the Chinese financial world is well-established, is elected as the head of the group. After arriving in China, he will attend the meeting of the Shanghai Japan-China Trade Association and meet with important Chinese figures to exchange views. (20th Allied Dispatch)

[Tokyo] The economic inspection group sent by Japan to Europe and the United States has been officially decided yesterday, with Shigekujiro Kadono as the head of the group. The head of the inspection group to China has also been decided, with Qianji Erwang as the director. It is heard that Kenzaburo Kato, the president of the Bank of Korea, Noboru Otani, the president of Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Hyakutaro Miyakikawa, the former president of Mitsubishi Corporation, and Seijiro Miyajima, the president of Mouth Qing Spinning Co., Ltd., and Reisuke Ishida, the executive director of Mitsui Bussan Co., Ltd., will also join. In addition, there are also three important figures from the financial circles of Osaka participating, such as Saburo Nango, the president of the Japan Cotton Yarn Co., Masatsune Ogura, the general director of Sumitomo Joint Venture, and one other person has not yet been determined. The delegation will depart for Shanghai on March 15, in time to convene the Japan-China Trade Association Conference. There is great hope here for the trip of Kodama and his party to China. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Tokyo] According to reliable sources, the leaders of the Japanese economic community do not intend to organize a group, but will each go to China alone to conduct inspections. The travel date must be determined after receiving a reply from China. (Central News Agency, 20th)

### Abyssinian Capital: Italian Governor-General Injured in Bombing

Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff Severely Wounded; Many Others Injured; Rome Shaken

[Rome] According to a dispatch from Addis Ababa, the capital of Abyssinia, General Graziani, the Italian Governor-General of Abyssinia, was slightly injured yesterday afternoon in an attack by natives. General Li Ruoda, the Italian Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff, was seriously injured. It is reported that General Graziani, accompanied by important officials of the Allied nations and several native chiefs, went to various churches in Addis Ababa yesterday afternoon to celebrate the birth of Prince Napoleon, grandson of the Italian King. Unexpectedly, a group of Abyssinian natives threw bombs at the civil and military authorities and native chiefs along the way. The Governor-General was injured by the bombs, but his injuries were minor. General Li Ruoda's injuries, however, were more serious. Abenha, the leader of the Coptic Church, an Abyssinian, was also injured by the bombs. There were many other injured, but the exact number is currently unknown. The news has greatly shaken the people here, because General Graziani, the Governor-General of Abyssinia, commanded a large army in Italian Somaliland two years ago to conquer Abyssinia and achieved outstanding military exploits. General Li Ruoda was originally the commander of the Rome Air Defense Force and was highly regarded. He only went to Abyssinia from Italy two months ago to organize an air base there. As for Abenha, he is also quite well-known, because at the beginning of Italy's attack on Abyssinia, Abenha was one of the first to surrender to the Italian army. (Havas, 20th)

[Rome] The details of this incident have now been officially announced by the Roman authorities. It is said that when Mr. Graziani was distributing gifts to the poor in churches and mosques, Abyssinians dissatisfied with Italian rule mingled in the crowd and threw hand grenades. In addition to Mr. Graziani and Mr. Li being injured, many Abyssinian people in the crowd were also injured. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 20th)

### US Battleships Must Equal Britain, etc.

US Naval Undersecretary Statement

[Washington] Naval Undersecretary Edison is currently planning to investigate the shipbuilding plants established by the US Navy Department and private individuals in preparation for the government's decision to build large numbers of warships to match the new programs of the British Navy. The Navy Department's intention is that the United States should maintain at least parity with Britain in terms of battleships, so as not to disrupt the naval ratio between Britain, Japan, and the United States. However, whether US shipyards can keep pace with Britain's large-scale shipbuilding is a major question, especially this year. Yesterday, Mr. Peng Haide spoke in the House of Representatives, saying that if the United States could avoid the arms race, he would strongly oppose the United States joining it. Today, President Roosevelt warned about the lack of steel for naval shipyards, saying that the government may soon have to step in, but he does not know if it is necessary to establish new legislation. When asked if the government had discussed reopening the Charleston arms factory in Virginia to speed up the Navy's program, the President replied, "No." Furthermore, Labor Secretary Perkins stated that the Navy shipyards' chances of getting steel are gradually improving. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 20th)

[Washington] The British government recently released a white paper on the national defense program, which included the British Navy's shipbuilding plan for the next fiscal year, including three battleships, seven cruisers, and two aircraft carriers. Today, when President Roosevelt met with reporters, he was asked whether the United States should also formulate a naval shipbuilding program to compete after the British shipbuilding plan was released. The President declined to answer, only saying that it is currently urgent to find steel to complete the shipbuilding program currently underway, and this difficulty is expected to be resolved soon. (Havas, 19th)

### British Arms Expansion Unrelated to Japan

Japanese Newspaper's Report is Nervous

[London] The London correspondent of the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun believes that the British advocacy of rearmament indicates that Britain will abandon its past policy of Anglo-Japanese friendship. Government officials here generally regard this statement as ridiculous, saying that Britain's policy towards Japan has not changed to date, and the reasons for Britain's expansion of armaments have been stated in the House of Commons. In short, Britain wants to make its military strength commensurate with its responsibilities. Moreover, the realization of Britain's plan has been unanimously recognized by European countries, and even Germany and Italy have not criticized it. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 20th)

### Canadian Fleet Aims to Avoid War

Parliament Passes Military Budget

Ottawa: Canadian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister King today issued a declaration stating that Canada will not be bound by any constraints or drawn into the vortex of war at future British Imperial Conferences without the consent of Parliament. Mr. King's declaration was issued after the Canadian Parliament concluded a four-day long debate on the government's $35 million national defense budget. Mr. King further stated that Canada does not want to be regarded as occupying an equal position, and that the defense of Canada's coast depends entirely on Great Britain. However, if Canada does not make its own efforts, it is tantamount to completely relying on others. Therefore, Canada's self-defense is fulfilling a part of its mission for all democratic politics in the world. Parliament then discussed a motion of no confidence in the government, which was ultimately defeated by 191 votes to 17. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 20th)

### US Fleet's Regular Annual Maneuvers

Total of 200 Warships; Exercises in North Pacific

[Washington] Officials announced today that the entire US fleet of approximately 200 warships will conduct its annual maneuvers in the North Pacific starting on April 16. The area will be a large triangle of 2 million square miles, with the Aleutian Islands as the apex, the Peninsula of Unalaska as the western corner, and the US Pacific coast as the eastern corner. For about six weeks, the ships will depart from San Diego and Saint Peter ports, advancing in a fan-shaped formation until reaching 180 degrees. However, due to the constraints of the Gentlemen's Agreement between Japan and the United States, they may not cross that line. Aircraft and aircraft carriers belonging to the fleet will participate in the maneuvers, and bases in Hawaii and the US mainland may also be within the scope of the exercises. As for the exercise plan, officials are keeping it strictly secret, only saying that they will conduct Fleet Plan No. 18, with Hawaii as the center. (National News, 19th)

### Germany Has One Car for Every Fifty People

[Berlin] The International Automobile Exhibition held its opening ceremony at 11:00 this morning. Ministers and leading figures from the Party and military attended. First, Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a speech, followed by a speech by Führer Hitler, who praised the motorization cause, saying, "When we came to power in February 1933, the average German had one car for every 100 people. Today, the average is one car for every 50 people. But compared to the United States, where there is one car for every five people, we are still far behind. It can be seen that we still need to make continuous efforts to accelerate the production of cars to make them accessible to the masses." The Führer then mentioned the raw material problem, saying, "Germany must not be subject to foreign restrictions in terms of raw material supply. This is a must. In terms of science, we have been able to use chemical methods to produce rubber and gasoline ourselves. Coal and iron will also be inexhaustible. All of this is because I am determined to ensure that the domestic automobile manufacturing industry uses purely domestic raw materials, so I spare no effort to do so. In short, if the free economic system can solve all the problems caused by domestic production, it would be good. Otherwise, we can only implement a controlled economy and continue to promote the Four-Year Economic Plan. I have said this repeatedly, and I hereby repeat it to clarify it." (Havas, 20th)

### Germany and France Schedule Trade Agreement Negotiations

[Paris] It is announced here that the Franco-German trade agreement negotiations will begin on February 25. The delegation led by the Director of Trade Agreements of the French Ministry of Commerce will leave here for Berlin on February 24. (National News, 19th)

### Various Countries Ban Volunteers from Going to Spain to Assist in the War

Germany, Italy, and Portugal Also Issue Bans; Effective from Midnight Last Night

[Berlin] The order prohibiting volunteers from entering Spain has been announced this morning and will take effect from midnight today. The order, signed by German Führer Hitler and Foreign Minister Neurath, prohibits Germans from traveling to Spain or Spanish colonies to participate in the civil war. Spanish Morocco is also included in the ban. The order also authorizes the Minister of the Interior to prevent those going to Spain from departing from Germany, or from feigning moral high ground, and prohibits the recruitment of soldiers in Germany to participate in the Spanish Civil War; violators will be subject to imprisonment. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 20th)

[Rome] Italy, in accordance with the resolutions of the London Non-Intervention Committee, has formally promulgated an order prohibiting volunteers from entering Spain. This order will take effect at midnight tonight, and the provisions for punishing violations have also been announced at the same time. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 20th)

Lisbon: The Portuguese government has recently issued a decree prohibiting the Portuguese people from participating in the Spanish Civil War. Those who have already participated in the Spanish Civil War must return to the country within one month. Foreign nationals participating in the Spanish Civil War will not be allowed to return to Portugal within five years. (National News, 20th)

[London] Czechoslovakia has formally promulgated an order in accordance with the resolutions of the Non-Intervention Committee, prohibiting the recruitment of volunteers within its borders to go to Spain and prohibiting them from transiting through the country. Provisions for punishing violations have also been announced at the same time. It is reported that the Belgian government will also announce a similar ban before midnight today, but at the same time, because the French-Spanish border will be closed tonight, volunteers from various countries are rushing to cross the border, especially new recruits from Britain, France, and Germany. The Spanish People's Front is making great efforts to promote recruitment in the last five minutes, so the number of those recruited to Spain today will greatly increase. According to reliable estimates, the number of Italian soldiers serving in the Spanish battlefield had increased to 55,000 before the fall of Malaga. There are fewer Germans. In recent weeks, very few Germans have crossed the border into Spain. Furthermore, approximately 1,700 to 2,000 officers will be required for this measure of monitoring volunteers and military supplies entering Spain, at a cost of approximately one million pounds per year. This expense will be borne by the countries of the Non-Intervention Committee, based on the proportion of the annual League of Nations dues paid by each country according to its financial resources and population. In addition to stipulating the deployment of patrol ships to patrol the Spanish coast, the monitoring plan will also station 60 commissioners in Portugal and 180 on the French border to carry out surveillance. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 20th)

[London] Regarding the prohibition of volunteers from going to Spain, orders have been issued separately by the countries concerned and will be implemented simultaneously from midnight today. As for the two matters of monitoring the land borders of Spain and the navies of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Russia, and Portugal separately monitoring the waters near Spain, they will only be implemented on March 6. The detailed plan for naval monitoring is currently being drafted urgently by experts from various countries. Approximately the naval fleets of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Russia, and Portugal will separately engage in monitoring within their designated areas, and the monitoring costs will also be borne separately. As for the issue of monitoring the Portuguese border, the Portuguese government has accepted in principle that Britain will send inspectors to work with personnel sent by the Portuguese government to monitor the land border between that country and Spain. However, some details have not yet been resolved and are currently being discussed by representatives from Britain and Portugal. (Havas, 20th)

Lisbon: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a communiqué explaining the attitude adopted by Portugal regarding the measures for monitoring non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, stating that Portugal has consistently refused to establish an international monitoring mechanism within its territory, but in order to avoid the failure of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, the Portuguese government has voluntarily invited friendly Britain to send multiple British inspectors to Portugal to investigate whether Portugal is strictly fulfilling its adopted commitments. However, these inspectors are not representatives of international organizations and do not have the same qualifications as the international monitors stipulated in the Adjustment Committee's plan. The Portuguese government hopes that the countries concerned will recognize that Portugal's attitude is out of goodwill. If this is not the case, if the countries cannot accept Portugal's position, then Portugal will not hesitate to withdraw from the Adjustment Committee and act on its own, so that the Adjustment Committee can still obtain the necessary unanimous approval.

### Philippine President Quezon Arrives in New York

Will Go to Washington to Meet Roosevelt; To Convene US-Philippine Business Conference

[New York] Philippine Commonwealth President Quezon arrived here today. New York Mayor LaGuardia formally greeted him at the Pennsylvania Station. In addition, there were approximately 2,000 welcomers, including Howard, the editor of the New York World-Telegram, half of whom were Philippine expatriates. After arriving at the station, Quezon went to the Ambassador Hotel to stay. He then made a statement saying that he came to meet with President Roosevelt. As for the issue of the US-Philippine business conference, he could not express his opinions until he had met with President Roosevelt. The issue of establishing an army base in the Philippines would not be brought up for discussion in Washington. Quezon also stated regarding the issue of the courts that the Philippine Supreme Court is the court in the Philippines that handles final appeals, and a two-thirds majority of the judges must pass a resolution to invalidate a certain law. Regarding President Roosevelt's judicial plan, he did not want to arbitrarily add or subtract from it, but he said that the two-thirds majority rule in the Philippine court is based on the principle that a one-person majority in a five-to-four vote does not have the right to veto the decisions of the government or parliament. Quezon added that a US-Philippine reciprocal trade agreement would benefit both countries. As for the current situation in the Philippines, Quezon said, "I don't want to boast now, but we are gradually developing. Gold mining companies have been established as opportunities arise, and the people are gradually trusting the government. Although there are still pessimists, capital has been flowing in in large quantities." Quezon will go to Washington tomorrow night or Sunday, after which he will travel to Europe with his wife and daughter to attend the coronation ceremony of King George VI of England. His wife, however, will postpone her departure because she is presiding over the Catholic Congress in Manila and was unable to come with him. (National News, 19th)

[Washington] President Roosevelt told reporters today that Philippine Commonwealth President Quezon will hold a meeting with him and officials from the State Department at the White House. A banquet has been scheduled for March 2 or 3. (National News, 19th)

Naples: The newly appointed US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Maynard, announced today that he will go to Washington no later than Thursday for instructions, and then depart for Manila to take office. The President thought it best for me to stay in Washington for a month to participate in the US-Philippine business talks, and then go to the Philippines. (National News, 19th)

[Washington] The Washington Post reported today that although Congress cannot grant the Philippines commercial rights superior to those of Cuba after the Philippines gains full independence, the United States is very concerned about maintaining the economic stability of the Philippines during the transition period. Relations between the two sides may be adjusted by concluding a reciprocal trade agreement. The agreement concluded between Cuba and the United States can serve as a precedent. (National News, 19th)

### The Japanese Diet Expected to Conclude Successfully

The Military and Political Parties Unwilling to Directly Clash; Finance Minister Ketsujo Explains Sound Policies

[Tokyo] The 70th Diet, since its opening, with differing views between the military and political parties on the current situation, brewed an atmosphere of dissolving the Diet. However, after five days of discussion, this atmosphere gradually dissipated. Initially, the political parties expressed passive dissatisfaction with the Hayashi Cabinet, repeatedly expressing some of their opinions during Diet questioning. However, the military, holding the key to dissolving the Diet, realized that although a decisive attitude was warranted, it would only cause chaos in the political world and fail to make the political parties recognize the current situation. Thus, they seemed to decide to first pass the budget and related bills through the Diet, and then implement the second phase of the reform movement. Furthermore, the government also vigorously sought a satisfactory conclusion to the Diet. Therefore, these circumstances, along with the political parties' lack of courage, have averted the crisis of a direct clash between the two sides. As a result, future Diet deliberations on the budget, tax increase proposals, etc., will be free of tension. However, there may be minor attacks from political parties from time to time, and in this way, proceeding towards the closing, the Diet is expected to conclude successfully.

[Tokyo] Regarding the content of the speech delivered by Speaker of the House Tomita concerning the speech given by Hamada Kunimatsu of the Seiyukai on January 21st in the House of Representatives, a document explaining the matter was submitted to the Army authorities. The Army authorities replied on the 19th, stating that the Army currently has no intention of making Hamada's speech a problem. Speaker Tomita believes that this issue has been completely resolved and will not report the matter to the Diet.

[Tokyo] The House of Representatives Budget Committee reopened yesterday at 1:40 PM, continuing the morning's closed session. At 2:25 PM, the closed session was lifted and a recess was taken. It reconvened at 5:15 PM, adjourned without conducting any business. The House of Representatives Budget Committee reconvened at 10:20 AM on the 20th, continuing the previous meeting. Katsu Masanori of the Minseito party took the stage to question, stating that the revised budget still emphasizes national defense expenditure while neglecting industrial expenditure. The previous cabinet's large budget of 2 billion yuan led to rising prices, and trade may be affected by the transfer of manpower for military supplies. Concerns about the digestibility of public bonds and the rebound of interest rates may also arise as a result. However, it seems that the anxiety mentioned above can be removed by stopping the implementation of this plan. But assuming that the anxiety cannot still be removed, are there any countermeasures? Finance Minister Ketsujo replied that the cause of rising prices cannot necessarily be removed simply by revising the previous cabinet's budget. However, in general, the amount of suspension of use is expensive for promoting the tendency of rising prices. Furthermore, rising prices are due to too many speculators, so this point can be removed a little. In addition, adjustments to interest rate relations and trade can be left to nature to slightly ease the impact in these areas. I intend to avoid using administrative means as much as possible. However, rising prices are a global phenomenon, and this point must also be noted. As for the problem of local fiscal adjustment grants questioned previously, I intend to quickly draft a finalized plan for the grants and submit it to the next Diet session.

Katsu Masanori asked, what are the specific policies for expanding productivity? What is the policy of mobilizing financial institutions, and what are your views on international economicism?

Finance Minister Ketsujo replied, that to expand productivity, it is necessary to mobilize the Bank of Japan and other financial institutions. This has been said before. Although Japan does not have the international economic power of the United States, if it has the momentum, it intends to use tariff policies.

Katsu Masanori asked, will Finance Minister Ketsujo abandon the doctrine of sound finance and rely solely on the issuance of public bonds?

Finance Minister Ketsujo replied that I firmly advocate sound finance. In other words, I reject the policy that it does not matter how much money is borrowed. However, given the current situation, due to national defense expenditure and other related factors, it is inevitable to admit that increasing the issuance of public bonds is an unavoidable measure. When the market price of public bonds is above the issue price, there is naturally no need to worry about digesting public bonds. However, if it falls below the issue price, digestion will be hindered. Therefore, it is necessary to seek to revitalize the industry to fill the gap in national defense expenditure and other expenses.

Katsu Masanori asked, why is the amount of suspension of use by the Army and Navy not specified in detail?

Vice Minister of the Army Umezu replied that after tightening the budget on the Army's side, the result of successive tightening is that savings have reached the extreme. However, explaining the details one by one is both time-consuming and technically difficult.

Navy Minister Yonai also gave the same response.

Katsu Masanori asked, in light of the current situation of rising prices, does the government intend to reinstate the reduction in salaries for government officials?

Finance Minister Ketsujo replied that we must not threaten livelihoods, so there is currently no intention to reinstate the salary reduction.

Okuchi Kiroku asked, what is the meaning of the current cabinet's so-called "renewal of all government affairs"? Prime Minister Hayashi replied that the renewal of all government affairs involves a wide range of issues. The fundamental is to enrich national defense, develop the economy, and unite people's hearts. Taken as a whole, this is the renewal of all government affairs.

[Tokyo] The House of Representatives General Assembly on the 20th convened at 1:40 PM and immediately entered the agenda to present a bill to amend the tariff reduction law and a bill to amend Law No. 51 of the Taisho 14th year (submitted by the government). Finance Minister Ketsujo explained the reasons for the proposals. Next, Okazaki Kyujiro of the Minseito party took the stage to question, stating that if the management of exchange rates and imports is inevitably reduced, the entry of iron will inevitably be reduced, and the price of iron will inevitably be high. What are the views of the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Commerce on this point? The total value of export trade is 2.5 billion, 37 kinds, but taxing 300 million of the 5 kinds is difficult to understand. I hope to withdraw the export tax bill.

Finance Minister Ketsujo replied that in the near future, the export of Japanese goods will not be reduced, so it is necessary to first seek to revitalize domestic production, so as to increase national income, the ability to digest public bonds, and the revitalization of export trade, and then slowly seek the abundance of material supply. This is my fundamental concept. The export control tax law still contradicts my concept. These two laws are not only for the purpose of taxing export goods. The world is working hard to prevent Japanese goods. To open it up, this bill is set up, intending to use the financial resources obtained from the implementation of this law to seek the smooth development of the entire Japanese export trade.

Minister of Commerce Godo replied that the demand for iron in the coming year is estimated at 500,000 tons of steel and 370,000 tons of pig iron. However, according to the rapid increase in production equipment, the production can be increased by 550,000 tons. Moreover, from foreign countries, such as the United States and France, 150,000 tons can be imported. In general, it is planned not to import expensive iron from foreign countries, but to strive to increase the amount of domestic production. Regarding the fuel problem, a concrete plan will soon be drafted.

[Tokyo] The House of Representatives Budget Committee temporarily adjourned at 12:20 AM today and reconvened at 2:26 PM. After Army Minister Sugiyama gave a public explanation regarding the Suiyuan issue requested by Matsuda Takechiyo of the Minseito party at the previous closed session, Okuchi continued to question, stating that strengthening exchange rate management and causing rising prices is an error in the policy of control. While Finance Minister Ketsujo is suppressing the budget, he is transporting cash on the other hand. How can such behavior be considered appropriate?

Finance Minister Ketsujo replied that strengthening exchange rate management and transporting cash will not cause mistakes, etc.

Next, Sakurai Heigo of the Minseito party raised questions about the current situation of the Manchurian-Soviet border issue.

Prime Minister Hayashi replied that the opinions of Japan and the Soviet Union are generally consistent on this matter, and there are two or three others. Negotiations are currently underway. After Foreign Vice Minister Horiuchi and Minister of Commerce Godo replied, Sakurai questioned China-Japan diplomacy, saying that after observing the course of Japan-China diplomacy to date, it cannot be said to be a diplomatic success no matter what. May I ask whether there are any shortcomings in the facilities for national contact and economic cooperation between Japan and China?

Foreign Minister Hayashi replied that the various facilities for Japan-China cooperation cannot be considered perfect, and we are currently planning to conduct further concrete research.

Sakurai asked what the progress was in the negotiations regarding the incidents in the past year in which Japanese residents were brutally murdered by China for no reason.

Foreign Affairs Vice-Minister Horiuchi replied that negotiations have been continuing since March of last year, and the issues have been gradually resolved, but there are still two or three unresolved ones. Sakurai asked what his views were on the Three Principles towards China of the Hirota Cabinet. Foreign Minister Hayashi replied that I believe that in principle, it is extremely proper, but in practice, there are still some disagreements. Sakurai asked whether the biggest obstacle to Japan-China diplomacy is the feelings and misunderstandings of the people of the two countries. China calls Japan an invasionist, but I believe that the two countries originally could not proceed without co-existence and co-prosperity. May I ask whether there are any active plans to proceed from both cultural and economic perspectives?

Prime Minister Hayashi replied that if China considers Japan an invasionist, it is truly regrettable. As for the friendship between the two countries, my opinion is exactly the same as that of Mr. Sakurai.

Sakurai again questioned what the current cabinet's Southward Advance policy was.

Army Minister Hayashi replied that regarding the solution of immigration and raw material problems, without placing undue emphasis on the mainland, the policy of advancing southward should be fully considered. The meeting adjourned at 6:35 PM. (Allied Press dispatch from the 20th)

### Continued Record of the Japanese Intelligence Agency in Zhengzhou Conspiring to Harm Our Country

Zhengzhou Dispatch: In early January of this year, the Zhengzhou Administrative Commissioner's Office cracked down on the Japanese intelligence agency stationed in Zhengzhou and seized various evidence of harming China, which has already been published in various newspapers. I have also learned that there are other documents that have been subsequently discovered and the dispatch book of the intelligence agency. Although they may be remnants and the text is incomplete, it is not difficult to find sufficient proof in the words of the intelligence agency's reconnaissance of military intelligence, the use of traitors, and the various activities of plotting to harm our country. Therefore, a more detailed record is given below.

㊀ Evidence of probing the contents of the Gongxian Arsenal: Delivered to the Garrison Headquarters, Gongxian Arsenal Investigation 11, 9, 22. (Investigation content omitted)

㊀ Plan to destroy northern Henan: On August 5th of last year, Wu Bainuo, who claimed to be the head of the northern Henan Autonomous Region, sent a letter to the Japanese Consulate in Zhengzhou requesting assistance to expand the autonomous army with 100,000 yuan, and to buy the Gongxian Arsenal with another 100,000 yuan.

㊀ Plan to obstruct or steal Chinese telegrams: Mr. Yamaguchi, Sergeant Nakajima came here last night and said that the army will use the special radio communications class set up by Mr. Yamaguchi to obstruct or steal Chinese telegrams (omitted below).

㊀ In addition, the dispatch book of the intelligence agency taken from the ashes is also sufficient to corroborate various conspiracies, and is also recorded in detail as follows: Dispatch Book of the Japanese Intelligence Agency (1)

### Guangdong Provincial Chamber of Commerce Strives for Taxation Standards for Business Tax

Deliberations by Representatives of More Than Thirty Counties and Cities

Guangzhou Dispatch: Because the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance modified the Business Tax Regulations, changing the taxable standard to business revenue, merchants throughout the province believe that it is difficult to implement. Previously, the Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce repeatedly fought for it, but without result. On the side of the Department of Finance, the case has been decided and it is impossible to withdraw the order. Officials and the people each trended to extremes. Recently, the Department of Finance sent business tax assessors from various counties to various places to supervise and ensure that shops in various counties and cities report the amount of business tax for the purpose of taxation. Therefore, it has recently aroused opposition from the chambers of commerce in various counties and cities, and representatives have been sent to the province to convene a joint meeting of the provincial chambers of commerce to discuss response measures. Those who have arrived in the province in recent days include representatives from the Shantou City, Foshan City, Panyu, Heshan, Qujiang, Dongguan, Nanxiong, Chenghai, Qingyuan, Yangjiang, Gaozhao, Xingning, Huiyang, Zhongshan, Daliang, Chencun, Shiqiao, Zhongtang, and Dichai chambers of commerce. On the 16th, a general meeting of members of the provincial chamber of commerce was convened, and He Jiping, a representative of the Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce, was elected as chairman. Representatives from various county and city chambers of commerce who attended included Li Zhongbiao, Tan Dichi, Feng Lvyu, and other thirty-nine people. During the meeting, the opposition to changing the business tax to be levied based on business revenue was discussed. The atmosphere was intense. It was unanimously resolved on the spot: 1. To designate Guo Xin and other twelve people to go to the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance, the Pacification Commissioner's Office, and the Provincial Government on the 17th to petition; 2. To submit a report to the Ministry of Finance strongly requesting the revocation of the new chapter on business tax; 3. To wire the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, requesting that the Guangdong provincial business tax still be levied on the basis of capital amount; 4. To establish a Guangdong Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation Tax System Research Committee, immediately appointing representatives of the Lechang, Panyu, Gaozhao, Shantou, Nanxiong, Qingyuan, Dichai, Jiangmen counties and cities chambers of commerce and all executive and supervisory committee members of the Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation as members of the Tax System Research Committee, and stipulating the principles of the Tax System Committee as follows: A. Before this case is resolved, reporting should be temporarily suspended uniformly. B. Strive to avoid using business revenue as the taxable standard. C. When estimating the taxable standard and tax rate in the future, the government should be requested to allow the chambers of commerce in the relevant places to participate. D. After the tax amount is determined, the government should be asked to announce it. In the future, when there are donations and taxes, the tax amount should not be used as the standard for drawing taxes. E. Those who report business tax with copper notes should pay taxes according to copper notes. If silver dollars are levied, they should be converted into copper notes for calculation. After the above cases were passed, the meeting was adjourned. The twelve representatives who were nominated to go to various agencies to petition first went to the Department of Finance on the 17th to petition. Secretary Gui Jingqiu of the Department of Finance received them. The petition representatives strongly stated the difficulties of levying taxes based on business revenue and requested that taxes still be levied based on capital amount. Before this matter is resolved, they should be temporarily allowed to extend the reporting of tax amounts. Secretary Gui immediately replied: 1. Before this case is resolved, shops are allowed to extend the reporting of tax amounts; 2. Levying taxes according to the old chapter must wait for detailed consideration before a decision can be made. The representatives then withdrew and went to other agencies to petition. Each agency only sent people to accept the report, and there was no statement of opinion. Sent to the Guangdong Central Committee members in Nanjing's Third Plenary Session, and Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance. Stealing on the 16th of this month, our Chamber of Commerce convened representatives from various chambers of commerce and city to hold a meeting. The new chapter of business tax in Guangdong Province will change the industry that uses capital amount to levy tax to use business income amount to levy tax. After the announcement, businessmen and the people were shocked. According to the investigation, Guangdong merchants have always had small profits, which is different from other provinces. Business profits and losses are uncertain. If a transaction is carried out once, a good tax must be paid. After repeated extractions, the people can’t stand it. In terms of laws and regulations, there is room for variation. In fact, it is absolutely impossible. The most important thing in taxation in Guangdong is the unity of the overall situation. All celebrate to receive Su. How can we suffer the people again? It has been resolved to forward it to the file. It is reasonable to send an electrical report to the verification office, asking you to propose that the Guangdong provincial business tax should still be levied on the capital amount, and also asking the minister to order the Guangdong Finance Department to follow it. I can't wait for the order of Guangdong Provincial Chamber of Commerce Chairman He Jiping, Standing Committee Member Chuan Yizhi, He Jingqing, He Yaochu, and Liu Buxuan, Chen, (17), Seal, (February 17)

### Songjiang

Burglary Case Cracked

After the Ben Cheng Dianye Bank was stolen of a huge amount of money on New Year's Eve, the county police authorities ordered a strict arrest in the case. Yesterday, someone holding the original thief-burnt banknotes stolen from the bank went to the Bank of China to exchange them. The bank knew that they were the original thieves from Dianye, and in addition to not exchanging them, they also notified Dianye Bank to report to the police station and send detectives to investigate. After investigation, it was determined that the exchanger was Jin Shiliang, who lived at No. 16, Xiuye Bridge North. The police station sent Inspector Yang to search his home, but found nothing. After interrogation, it was learned that the original thief's banknotes were hidden in Li Genquan's shop at the Xiechang Southern Goods Store on Huayang Bridge. Captain Yang went to the store at around 1 AM, called the door together with Town Chief Xu to search, and the store handed over Li Genquan and the original banknotes to the bureau for interrogation, saying that the ticket was indeed stolen from Dianye, but Li Genquan insisted that he had picked it up on the road.

Adultery Leads to Murder

Shen Youliang's wife, Shi Yuebao, a resident of the tenth household, section 3, Jiubao Township, Heqiao Township, second district of this county, continued to enjoy herself with her adulterer, Yang Zhongbo, a resident of Luduqiao, on the night of the 17th. She was caught by her husband, who gathered a crowd to catch the adulterer, tied up the adulterer Yang Zhongbo and beat him severely, threatening to kill him. When Shi saw this, she begged for forgiveness but was refused, so she returned to her room, took a knife, and committed suicide. Yang also suffered from freezing and severe beating, and his life was in danger. Yesterday, Hu Cheng, the reviewing officer, and the coroner separately inspected the remains for verification.

### Suzhou

Strictly Prohibit Electrical Perms

The Wuxian New Movement Promotion Association previously believed that electrical perms were harmful and unprofitable, and there were even cases of endangering life, so it was necessary to ban them. A document was sent to the Public Security Bureau for strict prohibition and investigation of a large number of perm equipment on file. However, after a long time, it was tolerated, and recently, various barbershops are still perming hair, and have come up with various new terms such as airplane style. Ordinary women do not know the pros and cons and flock to it. At the time of promoting the New Movement, it is necessary to strictly prohibit perms to avoid danger, so it has been decided to ask the Public Security Bureau to strictly prohibit them.

### Hangzhou

Hang Cao Section Opens to Traffic in July

The Hangcao Section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway is progressing rapidly. Of the 77 bridges, large and small, along the line, except for the Cao'e River Bridge, which is a huge project, all two caissons have been installed and sunk, and the business can be completed within a month. Steel beams are delayed due to late ordering and must be shipped in May and installed in mid-June. In addition to completing the project by the end of September, the remaining 66 bridges will be completed by April 15, except for the steel beams that must arrive in Shanghai and be transferred to the site for erection on the 10th of next month. Other engineering and earthwork projects can be completed by mid-March. The steel rails of this section are being transported for application in March due to the exchange relationship with a part of the Shanghai-Hangzhou section, and are scheduled to be completed by the end of June. Traffic will open to Ningdu from July 1st, but before the Cao'e River Bridge is completed, passengers will still need to cross the river to change trains to maintain traffic.

### The True Meaning of National Salvation Through Unification by Liu Shi

— Liu Shi

Except for those ambitious individuals and traitors who undermine unification, whom we must eliminate with force, we advocate that the forces of all social groups within the country should be concentrated to form a national united front to confront the current national enemy. Here, we urge everyone to abandon past grievances and to join hands and make peace with a calm and collected mind. Here, we proclaim that the survival of the nation outweighs everything else, even individual people or groups. Therefore, what China needs now is a unified nation capable of resisting enemy aggression and a national leader who can lead the nation to salvation. We oppose further political antagonism in China and oppose the expansion of internal divisions within Chinese society.

Therefore, China cannot have a so-called "People's Front" today. The anti-fascist People's Fronts in France and Spain today are not applicable to China, because the anti-fascist People's Fronts in France and Spain are frontlines formed from internal conflicts within France and Spain. Fascist rule in advanced capitalist countries poses a crisis of diminishing people's lives and property, so the people of France and Spain must rise up to oppose it. But China is different. Chinese society today does not have the foundation for this crisis. The current life-or-death issue for China today is not the crisis of fascist rule within the country, but the invasion of the national enemy and the nation's slide toward peril. This crisis not only harms the lower classes of Chinese people, but also Chinese national capitalists, and even financial capital. China currently does not face a crisis of fascist rule, and even fascist rule cannot be established, as the national enemy does not allow China to have an independent regime. Therefore, if someone today rashly advocates a "People's Front," mechanically imitating France and Spain, I would truly follow in the footsteps of Mr. Luo Meihuan and loudly shout "Down with the Chinese 'People's Front'!"

Does this mean that my opinion and Mr. Luo's are already consistent?

No! Although Mr. Luo is right to oppose the People's Front, he mistakenly believes that the National Front and the People's Front are the same thing and confuses the differences between the two! This mistake is truly a big one. I haven't had the opportunity like Mr. Luo to discuss the resolutions of the Third International and the "Communist Bandit Documents." I don't know what perspective they use to view the reality of China, but I discovered in Mr. Changjiang's "The Northwest Situation in Turmoil" (published in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on February 25th) that it is not the same as what Mr. Luo said. Although we cannot verify whose material is correct, comparing Mr. Luo's words with Mr. Changjiang's words clearly creates a contradiction. It is quite interesting. Of course, I don't need to pay much attention to this contradiction, because I am not a Communist, and I have no need to defend them. However, from my personal perspective, if the Third International and the Chinese Communist Party still oppose China's national salvation through unification today and want to use the "People's Front" to disperse national strength, then they have reached a dead end and have deviated from the Chinese people, and they are destined to perish sooner or later. Therefore, my personal feeling is that Mr. Changjiang's statement in "The Northwest Situation in Turmoil" regarding "the current transformation of the Communist Party" is more reasonable.

I am a non-partisan person, but I am also a "truly patriotic Chinese." I have a desire to save the nation, so I also have a national salvation proposal. For several years, my hope for peaceful unification to save China has been the same as that of many progressive individuals within the Party. When it comes to the grand strategy of national salvation, I have only written a few articles in magazines, which are mostly collected in the book "The Basic Understanding of National Salvation" cited by Mr. Luo. When I wrote those articles, it was precisely the time when many people were discussing the united front very enthusiastically. The words "united front" clearly explain the unity of the entire nation's strength, not a People's Front. In fact, the so-called national united front is just a clearer way of saying national salvation through unification, and the content is not different. When I said, "A united front is not about shortening the long to compensate for the short, eliminating all internal contradictions, but about uniting on one hand and struggling on the other hand..." I was not advocating a conspiracy, feigning compliance, but rather demanding that various social forces fully exert their respective strengths for national salvation under the premise of unification. Unifying national strength cannot be imagined as if the forces of various social groups will completely become equal in one day. I once jokingly said that there are tall people and short people here, and we must make the tall people take on the tasks of the tall people, and the short people must also have something to do, each exerting their own abilities. National salvation through unification means that we must not let go of a single ounce of strength within the nation and must mobilize all of it. During this unification process, because of the unevenness of social efforts and the unevenness of understanding, there will inevitably be slight differences in opinions regarding practical national salvation actions and strategies. A practical politician like Mr. Luo should not deny this fact. Then, in fact, we cannot deny the fact that there are relative contradictions between different social forces. There are still debates and struggles in practical actions, but these have a certain limit, which is that the struggle cannot hinder our unity. Now, standing from the Kuomintang's perspective, what I am saying is also reasonable. Today, the dominant social force in China is undoubtedly the Kuomintang. In a truly unified nation, the Kuomintang will naturally still have its own political views in every practical political action. It is not necessarily the case that it will agree with everything proposed by different political factions and individuals. Then, in the discussion of each practical issue, disputes are inevitable, which is a kind of struggle. Kuomintang members must strive to realize their own political propositions under the premise of unification; otherwise, they will fail in their duty as Kuomintang members. This is very easy to understand, so I also said, "People who generally misunderstand the united front think that since we are standing together, there is no need for any more struggles among our friends." This is entirely based on the facts. I dare not see unification as too beautiful or too abstract, making it mysterious, which would hinder the action of realizing unification.

### Shanghai St. John's Alumni Association Annual Meeting Unanimously Advocates Promoting the University's Registration

President Bu Gives Speech... Next Session's Officers Elected

The Shanghai St. John's University Alumni Association held its annual banquet at Yipinxiang last night at 7:00 PM. Over two hundred people attended, including Liu Hongsheng, Li Denghui, Chen Shiqi, Yang Kuihou, Zhu Youyu, Zeng Lubai, Ma Chonglun, Wang Futao, Liu Qisheng, Cai Zhenghua, Cai Zhengya, Diao Xinde, Ding Wenbiao, Zhou Qibang, Shen Siliang, Jiang Shangfeng, Xu Naili, and others. A business meeting was held first, followed by formalities. Association President Yao Zengmo chaired the meeting, delivered a welcome speech, and reported on the association's activities over the past year. Accountant Yang Kuanlin reported on the financial situation. After the report, the chairman reported that members Song Minzhang, Liu Linsheng, Ma Chonggan, Shen Shouyu, and twelve others had submitted a "Proposal to Promote the University's Registration" (original text attached) for discussion. Luo Machonggan rose to explain the origin of the proposal, stating that the university authorities and the board of directors were actively proceeding with it. The Wuxi Alumni Association sent a letter requesting the university's registration and requesting the association's response. Today's proposal is to express the unanimous opinion of all Shanghai alumni, so that the school authorities can resolve difficulties and expedite registration. Next, Liu Hongsheng and others expressed their opinions. All raised their hands and unanimously passed the proposal. Then, the next session's officers were elected: Liu Jisheng was elected president, He Linyi was elected secretary, and Xuan Binggui was elected accountant. At 7:30 PM, a dinner was held, still chaired by Yao Zengmo. Huang Renzhi urged that attention be paid to economic issues in the National Exhibition. President Bu Fangji reported on the school's situation, such as the construction of new school buildings and the admission of female students. He also said that he will go to the United States on April 1st for an eight-month sabbatical, taking the opportunity to travel around the world, and hoped that St. John's alumni would unanimously support the university. School registration will be achieved in the shortest time, and the future of St. John's is limitless, and it will cultivate more talents to serve the Chinese nation, etc. Finally, the alumni association song was sung, and the meeting adjourned at 10:30 PM. Attached is the Proposal to Promote the University's Registration: (Reasons) It is found that in recent years, most schools run by domestic churches have complied with government regulations and applied for registration. It is indeed necessary to adjust the curriculum within the school and protect the students' future. There is no need to repeat this. However, our alma mater, St. John's University, has been slow to complete the registration procedures. Although the actual situation may be different from other schools, graduates and students cannot obtain proper qualifications, and their pain is increasing day by day. Moreover, the alma mater is a leading academic institution in the country, and its long-term isolation will gradually lag behind. The glorious history of fifty years will soon become unknown, which is particularly regrettable. It is faintly heard that the school's主管authorities also know that registration cannot be delayed and that the policy of isolation cannot be maintained for long. Only because there is no strong expression from outside the school, the obstacles in the environment cannot be removed. If all the alumni rise up and appeal together, the atmosphere in the school can be changed, and the registration procedures will be easier to enter. It is a matter of public welfare, and all alumni will surely agree. (Methods) After this case is passed at the Shanghai Alumni Association's annual meeting, the Shanghai Alumni Association will send a letter directly to the president of the alma mater, sincerely requesting him to expedite the registration procedures in order to comfort public opinion. Secondly, the Shanghai Alumni Association will notify alumni branches across the country to send letters to the president of the alma mater before the end of March of this year, stating that the matter of the alma mater's registration cannot be delayed any longer. In this way, with everyone working together, the matter of registration can be completed as early as possible. Whether the above-mentioned reasons and methods are appropriate, please decide publicly. Ma Detai, Shen Shouyu, Zhu Minzhang, Ding Guojian, Cen Dezhang, Ma Chonggan, Qian Xiangbiao, Liu Zisheng, Liu Linsheng, Zeng Lubai, Liu Fengsheng, and Liu Yunfang, together.

### Liu Hesheng to Sue over Liangxi's Assault and Insult of Referee Incident

Related Parties Pay Attention to Discipline Issues, Will Make a Statement. The Iron City Cup Siege Dispute is Related.

The details were briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that after questioning by the Caojiadu Police Station, the three main culprits, Zhou, Wu, and Cai, have been temporarily released on bail. However, Mr. Liu Hesheng, the insulted referee, in order to uphold discipline, is prepared to hire a lawyer to file a lawsuit against the assailants, in order to punish one as a warning to a hundred. In addition to filing a case with the Caojiadu Police Station, he also went to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for examination, which has confirmed that there are indeed multiple injuries. Furthermore, the Shanghai Basketball Committee, which is in charge of this competition, will also impose severe penalties according to the law to eliminate this scourge. It is noted that last year there was a dispute with the Pudong Middle School basketball team in Shanghai Park, and the group fight during the Iron City Cup the previous month, the instigators of which were closely related to the assailants the night before. It can be seen that in the pure sports world, only a few dregs commit such acts. Therefore, the YMCA also expressed yesterday that severe punishment is necessary to deter future offenders. Otherwise, future athletes will become even more domineering and arrogant, and the dignity of referees will be completely swept away. Therefore, in addition to the victim seeking legal solutions, all relevant parties are paying close attention to the issue of sportsmanship and discipline, in order to eliminate this unfortunate incident.

### Toyota Mill Workers' Strike Caused Trouble, Resumed Work That Night After Persuasion

Demolished Caojiadu Branch, Injured Tan Baoshou, Police Opened Fire to Suppress, Three Workers Injured

Xinsheng News Agency reports that more than 3,000 workers from the new and old factories of the Japanese-owned Toyota Textile Mill at No. 200 Jessfield Road, Shanghai West, declared a strike yesterday morning because their representative, Sun Jiantai, was suddenly stabbed by thugs. They suspected that the mill's staff members, Shi Fulin and Shi Jingchun, had instigated the attack. The Caojiadu Police Station was also demolished, and the branch chief, Tan Baoshou, was injured. The police detachment used armed suppression to disperse the workers. Party and government agencies held a joint meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday to decide on a solution. The workers accepted the persuasion and resumed work that night. The details are recorded below:

Strike Petition

Sun Jiantai, the representative of the Toyota Old Factory of the Shanghai West Japanese Mill Workers' Welfare Association, was suddenly stabbed by thugs at his home on the evening of the 18th of this month. Workers from the new and old factories were very angry upon hearing the news, suspecting that the mill's inspectors and translators, Shi Fulin and Shi Jingchun, had instigated the attack. At 6:00 AM yesterday morning, as day shift workers were going to work and night shift workers were leaving work, the workers from both factories suddenly declared a joint strike, surrounding Shi and Shi. Tan Baoshou, the chief of the Caojiadu Police Station, immediately led police officers to rescue Shi and Shi, taking them to the Zhongshan Road police station. About 2,000 striking workers gathered and followed them to the Caojiadu Branch to petition.

Demolish the Branch

The petitioning workers arrived at the Caojiadu Branch at 6:30 AM yesterday morning. Branch Chief Tan Baoshou had not yet returned from the Zhongshan Road police station. The striking workers rushed into the branch, completely destroying all office items inside, and injuring two police officers, Chen Rongqi and others, with wooden sticks. Just as Branch Chief Tan was returning to the branch in a car with Shi and Shi, the striking workers swarmed forward, beating Shi and Shi. Branch Chief Tan's head was also injured. Shi Fulin was dragged to the Welfare Association and beaten. Branch Chief Tan was sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment after being injured, fortunately without serious injury. Shi Fulin was slightly injured, and Shi Jingchun took the opportunity to escape.

Dispatch Police to Suppress

The Police Bureau immediately dispatched a large number of armed police officers and two armored vehicles to Caojiadu to suppress the workers and persuade them to disperse. However, the workers' attitude was firm, and they had to fire warning shots. Worker Zhu Xingli was shot in the leg, Zhang Wenlong and Zhou Tongru were shot in the foot, and Xu Licheng's head was hit by a wooden stick. By 9:00 AM, the petitioning workers were completely dispersed. By 10:00 AM, the branch had returned to its original state and resumed normal operations. Thirteen workers were arrested and sent to the Penglai Road headquarters. As for the injured workers, they were sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. The list of arrested workers is as follows: Qu Hongnian, Liu Chunqi, Qin Qiaosheng, Chen Chunsheng, Chen Chunguo, Zhang Asan, Hu Shoukuan, Jiang Asi, Wu Jinsan, Gan Songlin, Wang Asan, Yang Yuanda, Yang Aer.

Party and Government Meeting

The City Social Bureau immediately dispatched Section 3 staff member Zhu Guilin to investigate upon receiving the report. The City Party Department also sent Civil Training Section staff members Li Weixiong to inspect. It is heard that the two have reported the situation to their superiors for verification. The City Party Department, the Social Bureau, the Police Bureau, and the General Labor Union held a meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon at the City Party Department to discuss solutions. The attendees included the Secretary-General of the City Party Department Jiang Huaisu, the Director of the Civil Training Section Zhou Funong, staff members Lu Yinshu, Li Weixiong, Yu Yaoqiu, the Director of the Mediation Section of the Social Bureau Wang Xianqing, staff member Zhu Guilin, the Director of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Police Bureau Yang Jinghuan, the Chief Inspector Wang Weiming, and the Chairman of the General Labor Union Zhu Xuefan. Secretary-General Jiang chaired the meeting and reported on the Toyota Mill workers' strike petition, and then began to discuss and decide on solutions as follows: (1) The City Party Department, the Social Bureau, and the General Labor Union will persuade the workers to resume work first. (2) The demolition of the Caojiadu Branch and the beating of Branch Chief Tan and others will be investigated and severely punished according to the law. (3) The case of Sun Jiantai, the chief representative of the Toyota Mill of the Shanghai West Japanese Mill Workers' Welfare Association, being stabbed by thugs will be strictly pursued. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.

Persuade to Resume Work

After the meeting, the City Party Department sent staff members Lu Yinshu and Yu Yaoqiu, and the Social Bureau sent staff member Zhu Guilin, to the Toyota Mill to meet the Caojiadu Old Hot Spring Street No. 16 Welfare Association to convene representatives from the Toyota Mill to persuade them to resume work. More than 100 representatives from the new and old factories attended. After repeated persuasion by representatives from the Party and government agencies, the workers' representatives accepted the persuasion and agreed to return to work at 6:00 PM. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.

Approve Bail

The workers of the Toyota new and old factories accepted the persuasion of the Party and government agencies and returned to work successively at 6:00 PM yesterday evening. As for the thirteen arrested workers, it was decided to allow them to be released on bail after the workers resumed work. However, the bail procedures were not completed last night. The police bureau decided to severely punish the assailants after investigating the matter according to law. In order to prevent further incidents, the police bureau dispatched a large number of police officers to be stationed near the Toyota Mill and Caojiadu.

### Receiving the Press for the Paris Exposition

Jade Artifact Preview Exhibition Established Yesterday

New News Agency reports: China's participation in the Paris Exposition held the inaugural meeting of the Jade Art Preview Exhibition at the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge yesterday at 4:00 PM. News media and all members of the selection committee were invited, with over a hundred attendees, including Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Li Yuying, Pan Gongzhan (represented by Wu Hengru), and reporters from various newspapers. Chairman Lin Kanghou reported on the purpose of the meeting, Liu Xichang reported on the progress of preparations for participating in the Paris Exposition, and Zhang Wendi reported on the origins of organizing the Jade Art Preview Exhibition. Wu Hengru also gave a speech. The event concluded at 6:00 PM.

Chairman's Report

Chairman Lin Kanghou reported, stating: Today, our country's Selection Committee for the Paris International Exposition is hosting the Shanghai news media and selection committee members. It is also the inaugural meeting of the Jade Art Preview Exhibition. We are grateful for everyone's presence. Since the beginning of the selection process, manufacturers have enthusiastically participated. All submissions will be subject to review by the review committee to determine whether they are qualified for selection. We plan to hold a preview exhibition in Shanghai for several hundred pieces of jade, among which the jadeite pagoda is the most precious. The pagoda took ten years of painstaking effort from planning and carving to completion, making its value known. The date of the preview exhibition is set for early March at the Husha (Lake Society). Tickets will be sold to help subsidize expenses. This participation in the Paris Exposition is entirely initiated by civilian groups. The expenses for going abroad are substantial. We hope that all sectors and members will support publicity, promote our country's culture and art, and win glory for our nation. The United States has scheduled a grand international exhibition for 1939 and has formally invited our country to participate. Therefore, we have specially organized the International Exposition Products Association (located on the fifth floor of the Pudong Building) to facilitate communication and assist the government in promoting national glory.

Preparatory Process

Next, Liu Xichang reported on the progress of preparations, stating: The Paris International Exposition will be held on May 1st this year, titled the Modern Literary and Technical International Exposition, including education, culture, art, industry, commerce, and economics. It will collect and exhibit emerging industries and cultural and educational undertakings from the last hundred years. The French government invited our country to participate the year before last. Our government politely declined due to special reasons. Subsequently, the French Association for International Cultural Cooperation and prominent figures from both countries with Franco-Chinese relations, as well as expatriates residing in France, recognizing the breadth of the exposition and the strong friendship and cultural cooperation between China and France, as well as the necessity of mutual support and cooperation in industry and technology, believed that participation in the exposition was of great significance and must be implemented. Letters and telegrams were exchanged, encouraging each other. Li Shizeng, Zhang Jingjiang, Wu Zhihui, Cai Yuanpei, Chu Minyi, and other gentlemen from the Chinese Association for International Cultural Cooperation initiated a gathering of Shanghai's leaders, including Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and Qian Xinzhi, to discuss the matter at the World Society. It was decided that the Chinese Association for International Cultural Cooperation, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, and the Bankers' Association would jointly organize the "China Participation in the Paris International Exposition Association." Chu Minyi, Zhao Zhiyou, Liu Fucheng, Xie Dongfa, and Liu Xichang were elected as representatives. After the establishment of the office, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan for record and notified the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Education, Railways, Communications, Industry, and Finance for assistance. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also instructed the Embassy in France to notify the French government and the General Office of the Exposition. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with the French Ambassador to China, Naziya, and submitted the list of representatives to the French government. This is the process of our Association's initiation to participate in the Paris Exposition. As for the work of our delegation and the recent level of preparation, there is also something to be said, which I will explain separately. The task of our delegation is to participate in the Paris Exposition. The first step, of course, should be to collect entries for the competition. The entries are divided into three major categories: culture, education, industry, commerce, and art. The culture and education section is requisitioned by the Ministry of Education through notices to the Provincial Departments of Education, the Municipal Bureaus of Education, secondary schools and above, vocational schools, and cultural institutions and scientific organizations throughout the country. The industry and commerce section is requisitioned by separately inviting leaders from the industrial and commercial sectors to organize a selection committee. The selection committee consists of more than eighty members, all well-known figures, who are working hard to solicit entries. Therefore, entries from various industries are exceptionally enthusiastic. The art section is requisitioned by Xu Shiqi of the National Art Association in Beijing and by Ye Gongchuo and Li Zuhan in Shanghai. Currently, industrial, commercial, educational, and art entries have been successively sent to our Association, and a collection point has been set up in the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall to facilitate all sectors. At the same time, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau and the International Trade Bureau are also assisting in collecting various export trade commodities. In addition, special products from provinces such as Guangdong, Fujian, Hebei, and Shandong, as well as fine products from nearby areas such as Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Yangzhou, are either collected by special commissioners or requisitioned by local chambers of commerce on behalf of us. Fortunately, all sectors understand the important significance of participating in the exposition and are enthusiastically responding to the call. In summary, all cultural, educational, industrial, commercial, and artistic items of national value are being collected as much as possible in order to enrich and perfect the exhibition in France, to promote our national glory. As for the French side, Representative Liu Fucheng has gone to arrange everything. At present, the number of entries received by the office of our delegation is already considerable, and the entries that have been identified are being rushed. They can be sent to the association successively in the coming days. Once the collection is complete, this office will convene a review committee to carry out the review. At the same time, the collection of items will be stopped, and the items will be packed into boxes successively after March 10th, and shipped to France by French cargo ship on March 20th. Because the exposition is scheduled to open on May 1st, time is pressing, and we have to step up our work. Among the various solicited entries, the jade industry's products are the most exquisite, including jadeite pagodas and various jade art products, with a value of millions of dollars. Therefore, our Association is holding a preview exhibition in Shanghai to allow the people of Shanghai to see them first. Today, we have not been thorough in entertaining all sectors. Please forgive us.

Origins of the Preview

Next, Zhang Wendi reported on the origins of organizing the Jade Art Preview Exhibition, stating: The purpose of participating in the expositions of various countries is not only to promote national glory, but also to have a significant impact on international trade. Therefore, the submitted entries must be carefully selected. Jade carving can be said to be a unique cultural art of our country. Each carving requires artists with more than ten years of experience to attempt. Jadeite carving is the most difficult. This time, we have been invited by the gentlemen of the Selection Committee for China's participation in the Paris Exposition to send precious jadeite pagodas and other jade artifacts abroad to participate. For the sake of promoting our country's art, we should do our best. It has now been decided to transport the jadeite pagoda to participate. The pagoda once participated in the Chicago Exposition and caused a sensation. However, there are many people in the country who have not seen this precious item. Now, it has been decided to hold a preview exhibition in Shanghai for all sectors to appreciate it.

Representative's Speech

Next, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, represented Wu Hengru in giving a speech, stating: Director Pan is in Beijing on official business and instructed me to attend on his behalf. I would like to take this opportunity to report to you that Chairman Chiang of the National Economic Commission advocates the promotion of domestic handicrafts. Our country's handicrafts are indeed valuable. In the future, they can not only meet domestic needs but also promote foreign trade. Therefore, a national handicrafts exhibition will be held in Beijing from May 1st to May 31st. This move has a great relationship with promoting our country's inherent handicrafts and foreign trade. Its significance is the same as participating in international expositions. As for the solicitation of items, the Social Affairs Bureau and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce have been entrusted to handle it. The collection has already begun, and the deadline is the end of March. The items will be transported to Beijing for exhibition in early April. It is hoped that all handicraft producers will enthusiastically participate. Furthermore, our municipal government will celebrate its tenth anniversary in July and plans to hold a handicrafts exhibition and sports meet at that time. All handicraft products participating in Beijing will be transported to Shanghai for exhibition.

### Shanghai Grand Theatre Destroyed Yesterday

Due to the screening of the film "Abyssinia," it was destroyed yesterday by Italian sailors and expatriates

Central News Agency reports: The Shanghai Grand Theatre, located at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road in the Extra-Settlement Road Area, No. 523, is run by Soviet merchants and often screens Soviet films. The "Abyssinia" film, produced by the Soviet Film News Factory and managed by the Asian Film Company, was destroyed by Italian sailors and expatriates in Shanghai. The losses are currently being negotiated by various parties. The details are as follows:

Resubmitted for Inspection

The Shanghai Grand Theatre is located at No. 523, at the intersection of North Fourth Road and Qiujiang Road in the Extra-Settlement Road Area and is operated by Soviet expatriates. It often screens Soviet-produced films. The "Abyssinia" film was produced by the Soviet Film News Factory. When the film arrived in Shanghai last year, it was submitted to the Central Film Censorship Committee for inspection and approval. The theater scheduled a premiere of January 21st, then the Italian Embassy lodged a protest with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that the screening be stopped. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a letter to the municipal government, ordering the responsible police station to prohibit the screening. The theater stopped screening it after only one day. The Central Film Censorship Committee also ordered the theater to resubmit the film for inspection. The theater complied and resubmitted the film to the Central Film Censorship Committee. Only the day before yesterday did it pass and get returned.

Screening Permitted

After the theater resubmitted the film for inspection, it published an advertisement to reschedule it for screening yesterday. Chen Zekuan, the head of the North Sichuan Road Police Station, saw the advertisement. Fearing that there would be trouble and not having received a formal written order, he still ordered the theater to prohibit the screening. The theater had obtained permission for rescreening from the Central Film Censorship Committee and had already published advertisements, making it difficult to stop. Director Chen reported the matter to Secretary-General Yu of the municipal government. Yu then sought instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At the same time, the theater also requested the Central Film Censorship Committee to request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to telegraph the Shanghai municipal government to cancel the ban. The Central Film Censorship Committee believed that the film had been re-examined and that its content no longer offended the country and should be allowed to be screened. Therefore, it granted the request. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also telegraphed the municipal government to cancel the ban. The municipal government then ordered Director Chen to allow the film to be screened for two days.

Incident Occurs

Yesterday was the first day of the film's rescreening. There were six screenings scheduled for 11:00 AM, 1:00 PM, 3:00 PM, 5:15 PM, 7:15 PM, and 9:15 PM. The first two screenings went smoothly without incident. During the third screening, dozens of Italian sailors in uniform (with "Lepanto" on their caps) and dozens of expatriates were in the stalls and balcony area. No one expected that an incident was about to occur.

The Course of Events

As soon as the newsreel ended and the main feature started, when the Abyssinian people swore an oath to join the army to resist the enemy, the entire audience applauded, expressing their sympathy. Suddenly, an Italian sitting in the balcony stood up and shouted slogans. Then, Italian sailors and expatriates sitting nearby all stood up and rushed towards the projection booth. At the same time, some Italian sailors and expatriates used pre-hidden wooden sticks to beat people indiscriminately and threw bottles of ammonia and nitric acid into the theater. The theater became chaotic. At the same time, argon gas filled the air, and the smell was foul. However, because the projection booth had been locked in advance and obstacles were piled up at the door, it was not easy to break through for a while. Finally, because of the large number of people and some holding weapons, the door was destroyed. The Italian sailors swarmed in, and all the machines were destroyed. The entire "Abyssinia" film was taken away. Other films stored in the projection booth were destroyed by nitric acid. At the same time, the theater's electrical technician, Abramovich (of Soviet Russian nationality), suffered a serious injury to his left arm. A Chinese technician named Ma Yaohua was also slightly injured.

Losses

While the theater was in turmoil, another hundred or so Italian sailors and expatriates outside the theater, led by someone resembling a military officer, also swarmed into the main entrance, completely destroying the large glass windows, ticket doors, electric light billboards, and various glass photographs. At this time, the audience was extremely panicked due to the extremely chaotic internal situation and the large number of people rushing in from the outside. They scrambled to escape. The situation was extremely pitiful. The Italian sailors and expatriates, seeing that their goal had been achieved, left the main entrance and boarded the prepared cars and left.

Police Station Report

Before the incident occurred, the North Sichuan Road Police Station had dispatched a police sergeant and three police officers to guard the entrance. After the incident occurred, the theater authorities immediately notified Director Chen Zekuan of the station. At the same time, the police sergeant stationed at the theater also rushed back to the station to report. After receiving the report, Director Chen led more than twenty police officers to the theater. However, the Italian soldiers and civilians had already fled and could not be arrested. Director Chen dispatched a few police officers to guard the theater and immediately returned to the station to report to his superiors.

Request for Negotiation

After the fact, the Central News Agency reporter inquired at the theater. According to the person in charge of the theater, the destruction of this theater seemed to be a planned action. It was witnessed that the Italian Vice Consul, Commercial Counselor, and military officers were also present. When the riot occurred, they destroyed the items as much as possible and shouted slogans and sang songs. It is still difficult to estimate the extent of the losses, but the Soviet Russian Consulate has been informed to request the Chinese government to seriously negotiate with the Italian Consulate.

Chen Zekuan's Statement

North Sichuan Road Police Station Director Chen Zekuan told the Central News Agency reporter that this unfortunate incident occurred. It was his duty, and although he had handled it carefully in advance, seeing that the more stimulating parts had been completely deleted, even if Italians went, it was thought that accidents would not occur. Unexpectedly, it exceeded expectations. After receiving the report, he rushed to the scene of the incident. Although it was nearby, by the time he arrived, all the rioters had completely retreated. Otherwise, they would have been arrested and dealt with according to law. He is reporting the circumstances to his superiors for handling.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Continues to Study Income Tax

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce studies income tax regulations, answers questions from various industries, and opens classes to teach various sections. The following is a continuation of the report.

Soliciting Opinions

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent letters to the Construction Industry Association, the Architectural Association, the Chinese Institute of Engineers, the Shipping Industry, the Inland River Shipping Industry, and the Copper, Iron, and Machinery Industry Association, stating: "The Provisional Regulations on Income Tax have been promulgated and implemented. The draft collection guidelines for various types of income tax have also been drafted separately and are being submitted to the ministry for approval. We are now investigating the draft collection guidelines for the first type of profit-seeking enterprise income tax. In the asset valuation method, the depreciation calculation table lists various buildings, decoration equipment, ships, machinery, tools, and equipment. It is estimated that the standard useful life is based on the nature of its structure. Whether the estimated useful life is accurate and uniform, and whether the highest and lowest limits should be added, seems to be of research value. In addition to separate letters, a copy of the original depreciation rate calculation table is enclosed for reference. Please check and study the useful life of various buildings, chimneys, decoration and ancillary equipment, ship machinery, tools, and equipment. Please send your opinions back to the Association by the 28th of this year for review and discussion."

Answering Doubts

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce transferred the two doubts raised by the Machinery Dyeing Industry Association to Accountant Xu Yongzuo for answers as follows: ㊀Workers' savings deposits, which are deposited in accordance with special laws, can be exempted from income tax in accordance with the tax exemption regulations of Article 2, Paragraph 3, Item 3 of the Provisional Regulations. Those who do not meet this condition should all be subject to income tax withheld by the interest-paying agency in accordance with the current interpretation of the regulations. ㊁The remuneration income of brokers should fall within the scope of salaries and remuneration, and if there is a fixed paying agency, the income tax should be withheld by the respective factories. However, because the payment amount and payment period are generally not fixed, it has not yet been determined how to handle the withholding procedures. There are probably two methods: one method is to see whether the amount paid each time exceeds 30 yuan. If it exceeds 30 yuan, the income tax should be withheld at any time. The other method is to calculate the income tax that should be withheld for each month based on its cumulative number at the end of each month, regardless of the amount paid each time.

Opening Classes to Teach

The Association has opened income tax research classes in the North Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the China Road Commercial Vocational School in Xiaonanmen, Nanshi, to teach tax payment procedures, calculation methods, etc. In recent days, personnel from various industries have been enthusiastically registering. North Shanghai has already reached its full capacity, and Nanshi also has more than fifty people. It is scheduled to start on the 25th of this month. In addition, the number of people attending the Southern Shanghai Improved Chinese Bookkeeping Class, which was specially opened due to income tax relations, is also very large.

### Short's Mother Hopes to Come to China

To visit her son's grave

The Continental Daily News reports that during the January 28 Incident in Shanghai in previous years, American youth aviator Mr. Short bravely fought Japanese aircraft in the sky over Suzhou and unfortunately died in action. His remains are buried at Hongqiao Airport. Sunday (the 22nd) marked the fifth anniversary of his death. The Shanghai municipal government and representatives of local organizations and friends of Mr. Short plan to go to his tomb at 2:00 PM on that day to present wreaths and pay their respects. Not long after Mr. Short's death, his mother came to China once. Recently, when Mr. Short's friend, Mr. Wagner, returned to the United States, his mother inquired about the situation of her son's grave. She hopes that the Chinese government will soon prepare travel expenses for her to come to China again to visit her son's grave.

### Former Spanish Commercial Officer in Shanghai, Sanji, Issues Statement

Feileier is illegal

New Sound News Agency reports that Feileier, the former Spanish Consul-General in Hong Kong, who resigned to the Madrid government, has now been ordered by the country's National Army government to resume his consular powers. Wei Shengqu, the former secretary of the country's Consulate, still supports its current government and therefore came forward to oppose Feileier. The details have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Sanji, the former Spanish Commercial Commissioner in Shanghai, has also come out in opposition and issued a statement yesterday. The gist of the translation is as follows: "Regarding the issue of Spanish consular jurisdiction, it must now wait for the decision of the Chinese government. Feileier is a false consul. I am now challenging him. Even if he recognizes that I am attacking his consular court, he cannot arrest me. Although I do not want to commit a crime, if I accidentally violate the traffic regulations when driving out one day, I am not afraid of the police station reporting Feileier's fine on me. Today (ie, yesterday), the newspaper (referring to a foreign newspaper) published Feileier's conversation, saying that on January 22, the traffic section of the patrol room submitted a case concerning a Spaniard to him. In this regard, I will send a letter to the Public Concession Bureau to demand the immediate cessation of such illegal steps. Feileier illegally issues entry permits, and he himself has committed a crime. Although the patrol room has verified the evidence, it has not been able to arrest him. Feileier must know that the entry permits he issued are not recognized by the local authorities and are completely invalid. At present, I only hope that the Spanish government (referring to the Madrid government) will soon have a legal representative stationed in Shanghai, so that Feileier's various illegal acts can be stopped." There is a person named Gao En who intends to go to the United States. He obtained an entry permit issued by Feileier before Feileier resigned. Now, because the certificate has been issued for a long time, he fears that it will expire. He went to Feileier's office again a few days ago to ask him to add a note and took it to the US Consulate for verification. Unexpectedly, it backfired and was rejected by the US Consulate. The United States does not recognize the Spanish National Army government and cannot recognize Feileier, who has resigned, as the Spanish Consul in Shanghai. Therefore, the entry permit was rejected and invalidated due to Feileier's endorsement.

### Anhui Construction Director Liu Yiyan's Mission in Shanghai

Negotiating Loans with the Bank of Communications

Liu Yiyan, Director of the Anhui Construction Department, came to Shanghai from Anqing the day before yesterday and is staying at the Cangzhou Hotel. The Times reporter visited him yesterday to inquire about his mission in Shanghai. According to him, this trip to Shanghai is to negotiate a loan with the Bank of Communications. The total amount of the loan is 2.5 million yuan. Since the province implemented the unified sales of black tea last year, the results have been quite good. However, the loans to tea farmers are currently being lent by the provincial government at low interest rates so that farmers can fully develop production. This year, Anhui tea farmers are in the cultivation period, so the demand for loans is very high. The Bank of Communications has made huge loans to Anhui Province for many years and has been very helpful in developing black tea. This loan of 2.5 million yuan has been negotiated and will be used for Qihong loans in principle, guaranteed by the provincial government. As for interest and mortgages, they are the same as in the past.

### Rongmao Lumber Mill Workers Went on Strike Yesterday Morning

Resumed Work in the Afternoon

According to the Dagongshe, the Huashang Rongmao Lumber Mill at 1912 Zhoujiaqiao, West Shanghai, employs over 60 long-term workers and over 140 temporary workers. Yesterday morning at 6:45 AM, over a hundred workers had already entered the factory to work. Unexpectedly, around 8:00 AM, several workers rushed into the factory, demanding that all workers join the strike. The factory management, deeply fearing an incident, immediately released all the workers from work. Upon receiving the report, the Municipal Party Headquarters dispatched Lu Yin-chu, Yu Yao-qiu, and others to investigate the truth and earnestly advise. It is now learned that the striking workers, realizing that this strike was due to a misunderstanding, had over 30 workers return to the factory to work around 3:00 PM in the afternoon. By 7:00 PM in the evening, all night shift workers had entered the factory and resumed normal work.

### Shandong Provincial Party Headquarters Responds to the United National Salvation Movement

The Shanghai United National Salvation Grand Alliance of All Circles received a telegram from the Shandong Provincial Party Headquarters, responding to the United National Salvation Movement's proposition. The original telegram reads: "To the Shanghai United National Salvation Grand Alliance of All Circles, Your telegram received with utmost inspiration. At this moment of internal worries and external troubles, intertwined and pressing, the national situation is perilous, like a bird's nest on a curtain. Without internal stability, there is no way to repel external enemies; without unity, there is no way to seek survival. All the wise and far-sighted in the country are consulting and agreeing. Therefore, 'All traitors, communists, feudal warlords, and all those who obstruct the United National Salvation should be eliminated thoroughly according to the national will with the greatest determination.' Gentlemen, your far-sightedness is profound, your insight is keen, and your excellent plans are worthy of emulation. This headquarters is willing to lead all comrades in the province and vow to be the backing. Special telegram in response, respectfully hoping for your consideration." Shandong Provincial Party Headquarters.

### 80th Anniversary of the North German Lloyd Shipping Company

The North German Lloyd Shipping Company, managed by Melchers & Co. in this port, celebrated its 80th anniversary yesterday. Celebrations were held in various cities around the world with German consulates. According to records, the company was founded in February 1857 by the consular officer Lale, with only three small transport ships traveling between England and Germany. The following year, a ship of about 2,500 tons, named the "Bremen," crossed the Atlantic from Bremen to New York. Since then, it has gradually expanded. By 1924, when the European War broke out, the total tonnage of its ships had reached 982,951 tons. Its ships traveled across all oceans, making it one of the world's leading shipping companies. After the end of the European War, it was reduced to 57,671 tons. Once the overall situation was stabilized, it revitalized its business. As of today, it has about 600,000 tons again. From 1935 to 1936, it launched the Far East Express service with three famous ships, each with a load of 18,000 tons. One of its largest three mail ships operating on the Atlantic route, named "Bremen," has a load of over 51,731 tons.

### The Two Railway Administrations Instruct All Departments to Pay Attention to Division of Labor and Cooperation

Rotating Daily to Hold Consultation Meetings

The Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Administrations previously formed a railway administration inspection team to inspect the two railways in order to improve railway administration. According to the inspection team's report, the personnel in charge of the carriage, machinery, and police affairs at the major stations lacked communication, so although there was division of labor, there was no cooperation, which greatly affected the railway administration facilities. In order to remedy this situation, all departments are specially ordered to designate several major stations and instruct the leading or senior personnel in charge of the carriage, workshop, machinery, and police affairs departments at each station to convene a discussion meeting once a month on a rotating basis to exchange opinions on station affairs. If the station has personnel in charge of materials and health care, they can also participate. If important accidents occur temporarily, temporary discussion meetings can also be convened for consultation. Once a solution is agreed upon, each person in charge will be responsible for implementing it within their scope. The procedures must be simple and agile. Upon receiving the instructions, all departments will designate personnel to be responsible for handling the matter.

The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, in order to crack down on anonymous accusations of opium and drug cases, framing innocent people, or impersonating officials to search and extort property, issued Announcement No. 6 yesterday, prohibiting such actions. (Omitted above) "Although this bureau is not a judicial organ for opium and drug cases, it is responsible for investigating and cracking down on opium and drug cases. (Omitted in the middle) However, after investigating, we have found that Shanghai is a place where people from all walks of life live, and there is a mix of good and bad. It is difficult to guarantee that there will be no unscrupulous people who anonymously accuse and frame innocent people, or impersonate officials of this bureau, falsely claiming to search and extort property. If we do not strictly prevent and control this, how can we eliminate the bad and protect the good? Now, the following measures are stipulated: From the date of this announcement, all personnel of this bureau who are ordered to investigate and crack down on opium and drug cases must carry the identification card issued by this bureau. Police officers must wear badges to prove their identity. After the inspection is completed, the police officers must fill out an inspection certificate and submit it to the bureau for record. If there is no such proof, the residents being inspected have the right to refuse the search. If they can identify that the car belongs to an impersonator, they are allowed to arrest them and send them to the bureau for interrogation and severe punishment. If police officers engage in procedures that do not comply with regulations or engage in harassment and extortion during the execution of the search, they should immediately report to the bureau in accordance with the law. Once verified, they will be severely punished. As for anonymous complaints, this bureau will conduct a thorough investigation and search only after having credible evidence. If it is found that the complaint is based on a grudge, we will pursue the matter and bring them to justice. We will never tolerate such behavior. (Omitted below)"

### Central Cold Storage Plant Auctioned Due to Poor Market and Heavy Losses

Selling Price: 25,300 Yuan; Yan Ziyu Has Declared Bankruptcy

The Central Cold Storage Plant at 619 East Broadway Road, Hongkou, was jointly established by Ningbo natives Yan Ziyu and Yu Wenhao. It has been in operation for seven years, specializing in the export of egg yolk and egg white and the production of water. The business was very large. During its peak years, it made a profit of more than 2 million in two years. As a result, two branch factories were established in places such as the Dixiwei Road. Yan went to Europe and the United States to conduct inspections in the past year, spending 7,500 British pounds. After returning to China, he made major reforms. Unexpectedly, in the past two years, the company has suffered heavy losses due to the impact of the global economic downturn and poor market conditions, with debts reaching 1 million. Unable to pay the debts, the creditors filed lawsuits with the First Special Court one after another, and the factory was subsequently sealed up. At that time, Yan still wanted to struggle and tried to reopen the factory, but the creditors could not agree. On the 16th (sixteenth) of the past, the Special Court implemented the auction. The lawyer Fei Si represented the purchase, with a selling price of 25,300 yuan. It is currently being dismantled, and the factory will be completely eliminated. Hundreds of male and female workers and staff members have been reported to have lost their jobs. Yan has also been accused of being wanted by Xu Weiji. He was arrested and detained in the Special Court's detention center a few days ago. The creditors have filed lawsuits and chased after him. Now Yan Ziyu has declared bankruptcy, and the Special Court has appointed accountant Li Ding as the bankruptcy administrator.

It was resolved that the association would be unanimously supported to proceed with the established average sharing method, and Hou Shaoan, Gu Songmao, Wang Kunyi, and Yin Zhiling were elected to exchange documents and sign an agreement with the Shanghai Municipal Council. ㊁ The Social Affairs Bureau instructed that a one-year plan for literacy education for rickshaw pullers should be launched from March, and each rickshaw should bear a monthly expense of 30 cents. It was resolved that the rickshaw owners have already borne a mutual aid fee of 1.5 yuan per rickshaw, and it is difficult to take on this expense. It was decided that representatives would petition the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association on a scheduled basis. ㊂ Negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Council to no longer replace new rickshaws and new rickshaw designs after the reduction of vehicles. The resolution was passed. ㊃ Negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Council to exempt rickshaw pullers from carrying raincoats on sunny days and to prevent police from arbitrarily prying licenses and detaining them. The resolution was passed. As for the representatives for the exchange of documents, Hou Shaoan and the other four went to the Shanghai Municipal Council at 11:30 AM to sign an agreement with the Director General Fei Li Pu. All rickshaw owners have registered their rickshaw owner certificates with the association, and the association has submitted them to the Shanghai Municipal Council for verification. At the same time, the association decided to send representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau, the Mutual Aid Association, and the Shanghai Municipal Council on Monday morning to petition on the issue of rickshaw puller education fees, arguing that rickshaw owners cannot afford to bear the expense. If they want to start rickshaw puller education, the Mutual Aid Association can allocate funds based on the number of rickshaws.

### Mastermind of the Jingyun Building Robbery Case Apprehended in Pudong

Zhu Xisheng Admits to Group Robbery; Most of the Others Do Not Admit

At 11:30 AM on December 21 of last year, several fierce robbers suddenly came to the accounting office of the Nanzun businessman Liu Jingde Tang, located at Room 508, Jingyun Building, 378 Beijing Road, under the guise of renting a house. They opened the silver boxes inside and outside and searched for loot, obtaining more than 4,500 yuan in total. They fled with the money. At that time, the tea boy Wen A-kun took the opportunity to slip out and reported to the gatekeeper Pan Shoulong, who called for help outside. A Chinese and a Western detective from the Central Police Department were dispatched to arrest them. The two sides fought fiercely. As a result, the Western detective and the gatekeeper both died in the line of duty. One of the robbers was also killed while fleeing. After the incident, the Central Police Department exhausted its efforts for several days and successively apprehended more than ten suspects in places such as the South Wharf in Pudong, a certain hotel on Wuma Road in the Public Concession, Xiaopi Lane in Nanshi, and West Baoxing Road in Zhabei, and sent them to the First Special Court for separate trials. It is now learned that Wang Shifu, the captain of the Detective Squad of the Pudong Police Sub-Bureau, learned that

The mastermind of the case

Zhu Xisheng, was hiding in the Xiaonan Wharf area of Pudong. He immediately dispatched detectives Li Guisheng and Jiang Binru to rush to the area at 10:45 PM the day before yesterday. Using swift means, they arrested Zhu and brought him to the team. According to his confession, he is 35 years old, a local, a doctor, and lives at 77 Zhoujia Lane, Tangqiao, Pudong. He admitted that he had participated in the robbery of Jingyun Building at the end of last year and also confessed that in February of last year (lunar calendar), at about 10:00 PM on a certain night, he held a gun and robbed a family surnamed Xu in Tangqiao, Pudong, of a pair of gold earrings and 5 yuan in legal tender, together with accomplices Yao Zhoukang and Zhang Jian, who were hiding in Room 22, Daxin Hotel, Hubei Road, Public Concession. The bureau then dispatched detectives Liu Changrui, Liu Hanxia, Cui Youkuan, Wu Tao, and Zhang Hongxiang to rush to the hotel at 2:00 AM yesterday to conduct a search but found nothing.

Only Dai Quanqing was arrested in the room. According to his confession, he is 36 years old, a local, and lives at 128 Qigan Bridge, Zhoujiadu, Pudong. He works at Jia Fook Kee Transport. He said, "Room 22 is my room. Kang Zhangjian came to visit yesterday afternoon and hung his coat on the hanger and left. I don't know that they are robbers." The detectives then went to the residence of Yao Zhouzhou at 51 Beishou, Liuli Bridge, Pudong, and arrested Yao and brought him to the team. He confessed that he is 31 years old, sells vegetables. In the first half of last year, I, Zhu Xisheng, and two people from Jiangbei broke into a family surnamed Xu in Tangqiao and robbed them of a gold earring, three sets of Xiangyunsha shirts and trousers, 5 yuan in legal tender, and 300 copper coins. Also, at the end of the year before last, they robbed a family surnamed in Bailianjing, Pudong, of dozens of yuan. Also, in the summer of last year, Kang Zhangjian and Lao Yang and others sent letters to extort 150 yuan in legal tender from the manager of a foreign firm in Tiantong Temple, Zhabei. I received 10 yuan. Regarding the Jingyun Building robbery case,

I did not participate.

The original patrol team continued to apprehend the suspect Cai Jianquan at the Pudong South Wharf Ferry at 9:00 AM yesterday. According to his confession, he is 39 years old, a local, and lives at 8 Yangjia House, South Wharf. He sells vegetables. He did not know anything about the Jingyun Building robbery case. However, he knew Yao Zhouzhou. Yao once said that Kang Zhangjian often visited the Daxin Hotel. He and Zhu Xisheng did not do good things, but he did not know the details. After verifying the confession, the team handed over all the criminals to the Detective Brigade of the Municipal Police Bureau for interrogation yesterday afternoon.

### Anton Road Area Construction Laborers Petitioned Mr. Yu Yesterday

Requesting the Municipal Council to Return Their Licenses

More than one hundred temporary road construction laborers, including Kuai Jiade, from the Anton Road area in Eastern Shanghai, jointly submitted a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, which read, "We, more than three hundred temporary road construction workers, formerly employed by the Anton Road Works Department, held temporary road worker licenses. Whenever there was a heavy workload, we temporary workers supplemented the work. For the past five or six years, we have diligently performed our duties. Unexpectedly, in December of last year, the Works Department announced a reduction in spending and layoffs. The labor foreman in this area, Zhang Amao (formerly a drainage ditch foreman in the Sanitation Department), preemptively collected our temporary worker licenses and laid us all off, causing us to lose our jobs. At that time, we intended to make a request immediately, but considering that long-term workers were also being laid off at the same time, we felt it was reasonable to address the long-term worker issue first. Now, seeing reports in the newspapers of the 18th of this month stating that your Council declared, 'This Council has not discussed reducing road workers to this day,' the workers, after reading this, realized that the so-called reduction in road workers was purely a trick played by the foreman. We dare not blindly assume his intentions, but he used the excuse of reduced spending to collect all of our temporary worker licenses and hire drainage ditch workers to fill our positions, which clearly shows that he has other plans. It is evident that Zhang Amao fabricated rumors, damaging the reputation of your Council, which is unforgivable. Therefore, we earnestly request your review and approval to return the temporary licenses that were unjustly taken back by the foreman, in order to maintain the livelihood of the laborers, which would be a virtuous act. "Yesterday at 2:00 PM, Kuai Jiade, Liu Demao, Mao Yude, and others were appointed as representatives to petition Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese Director, requesting the restoration of temporary work to maintain their livelihoods.

### French Police, Fully Armed, Arrested Thieves; Wealthy Merchant Fled in Panic and Was Injured

Unexpectedly, the location turned out to be the residence of a wealthy merchant named Jin. The servants in the house, suspecting a robbery, were extremely frightened and shouted loudly. Mr. Jin, the owner of the house, woke up upon hearing the alarm, opened the window to look out, and saw many people outside holding guns. In a moment of panic, he climbed onto the drying platform, intending to jump into the neighboring house to escape. However, in his panic and confusion, he lost his footing and fell from a height, causing severe head and body injuries. After searching, the detectives found no trace of the thieves. They then took the injured Mr. Jin to the hospital for treatment.

### Zhabei Police Station Added Police Officers

Yesterday morning around 6:00 AM, the North Railway Station Police Sub-bureau and the Xin Zha Police Sub-bureau, due to the incident of workers from a Japanese-owned cotton mill in Western Shanghai destroying the Caojiadu Police Sub-bureau, feared that the large number of workers would cause further trouble. To prevent such a situation from occurring, they were ordered by the Supervisory Office of the Police Headquarters to not only transfer a number of officers and patrolmen from each sub-bureau in shifts for protection, but also to transfer ten officers from each police precinct to the sub-bureau for rotational protection until the evening, which had not been lifted. Therefore, no incidents occurred at any of the sub-bureaus yesterday.

Since the Tongyi Trust Company announced its closure, five mediators, including Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Pan Zhaobang, and Chen Zhigao, hosted more than sixty representatives of creditors from both local and out-of-town areas at the Yihang Western Restaurant to discuss the company's resumption plan. At that time, the creditor representatives unanimously agreed that bankruptcy proceedings would take time, and prolonged delays would only lead to disputes over petty matters, resulting in little gain in the future. They believed that the coordinated plan was fair and appropriate and expressed their support. However, in order to support the healthy development of the new company, they hoped to find other ways to raise funds to ensure complete success. The mediators then contacted the banking industry in the city repeatedly. It has now been finalized that a syndicate of five major banks will raise 640,000 yuan in legal tender to assist. The company's prospects for resumption of business are becoming increasingly concrete.

Mr. Yu, Mr. Du, and Mr. Shi, at the request of creditors from both local and out-of-town areas, had previously requested the China & South Sea Bank to provide loans against the Tongyi Company's debts before the lunar New Year. The bank had already stopped accepting deposits. Recently, at the request of Mr. Yu and other creditor groups, they agreed to extend the deadline and, considering the small depositors of the company, requested an increase in the value of the collateral. Therefore, they decided to extend the collateral term for deposits at Tongyi Trust Company by one month, and to specially increase the collateral value for deposits of 50 yuan or less.

### Pig Iron Prices Soar, Foundry Industry Raises Prices

Recently, the price of Yangzi pig iron has been soaring continuously, increasing the cost of the machinery industry. The Foundry Industry Association of this city believes that the cost is too high, and raising prices is necessary to save the industry. Furthermore, because Yangzi pig iron is produced domestically, the repeated price increases are hindering the sales of domestic products. Yesterday, the eleventh executive committee meeting was convened, with all five members of the committee present, and over 4,000 factory representatives attended to listen. Chairman Zhou Cumei decided on the following key issues: (1) (2) Omitted. (3) Regarding how to remedy the recent soaring prices of raw materials, it was decided to increase the price by one point again according to the original price to cover the cost. (4) This price increase is of great importance to the industry and all colleagues should be advised to abide by it. It was decided to publish a notice to colleagues. (5) Regarding the recent sudden and abnormal increase in the price of Yangzi pig iron, which has resulted in breaches of trust and caused significant harm to the industry, it was decided to send a letter to the Liuhegou Coal Mine Company requesting them not to arbitrarily increase prices, in order to avoid hindering the sales of domestic goods. It was also decided to send a letter to the Iron Industry Association stating that future price increases should still be handled according to past practices and that a one-month notice should be given in advance. (6) Appointed a special committee to draft the industry regulations for the water industry. It was decided to appoint He Ganrong, Hu Ruixiang, and Zhu Bozhen as members responsible for drafting the regulations. The rest is omitted.

### The Wang Zilin Murder Case is Bizarre and Extremely Complex

Detective Bai Zhonglin Testified that the Case Was Solved Through Informants; Ordered the Deceased's Wife to Write a Letter to Summon His Two Brothers to the Case

Wang Zilin, a native of Zhenjiang residing at 28 Jiumu Lane, was fatally injured with an axe on Fangbang Road on May 27th. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Detective Team arrested Zhang Rugeng, Huang Liantang, Tao Jigen, Bao Lixue, Gao Yiyu, and others, and sent them to the District Court. Prosecutor Tang investigated and filed a public prosecution, the gist of which stated that Zhang Ruyi, also known as Zhang Yiyi, believed that Wang Zilin, also known as Wang Zilin, had an affair with his sister-in-law, Zhang Chen, and harbored resentment. Therefore, in May of last year, he conspired with Bao Lixue, Gao Yiyu, and Huang Liantang to murder Wang Zilin, and instructed Bao Lixue to instigate Bao Guanbao to carry out the plan, agreeing on a reward of 200 yuan. On the afternoon of the 26th of the same month, Bao Guanbao, together with Teng Guangyin and Tao Jigen, lay in wait at the intersection of Fangbang Road and Zhenling Street. Huang Liantang used the excuse of borrowing a radio for repairs to lure Wang Zilin to his home for repairs. When Wang Zilin returned home and passed by the intersection, Bao Guanbao and Teng Guangyin jointly stepped forward and injured his head and other parts of his body with an axe, while Tao Jigen kept watch nearby. Subsequently, Wang Zilin died of his injuries at 11:00 PM on the same day. The police were notified and arrested Zhang Chen, Zhang Shulin (i.e., Zhang Chen's husband), and Zhang Rentai, but they were released due to insufficient evidence and the wanted notices for the murderers were issued. In November of the same year, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau learned of the details and successively brought Tao Jigen, Bao Lixue, and Gao Yiyu to the court. Tao Jigen, Bao Guanbao, and Teng Guangyin were charged with the crime of committing Article 28 of the Criminal Law and Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the same law. Zhang Rugeng instructed Bao Lixue to instigate Bao Guanbao to carry out the plan, and Bao Guanbao made the decision to commit murder due to Bao Lixue's instigation. Bao Lixue was a direct instigator, and Zhang Rugeng was an indirect instigator. They were charged with instigating the commission of Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the same law in accordance with Article 29 of the same law. Gao Yiyu participated in the conspiracy beforehand and received a reward of 20 yuan afterward. Huang Liantang induced Wang Zilin to come to his house to repair the radio, making it convenient for Bao Guanbao and others to kill him upon his return home. They were all accomplices in the case and were charged with Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the same law in accordance with Article 30, Paragraph 1 of the same law. They were prosecuted in accordance with Article 230, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Judge Li Xuedeng opened the court yesterday to hear the case. Family members of the victim hired lawyer Shen Ying to appear in court and filed a civil lawsuit for 3,000 yuan. The defendants Tao Jigen, Bao Lixue, and Gao Yiyu, who were in custody, were brought to the court. Zhang Rugeng, Teng Guangyin, and Bao Guanbao were all at large and had been wanted. Huang Liantang was released on bail. The defendants who appeared in court all denied committing murder. Detective Bai Zhongqi, the leader of the First Squad of the Detective Team, testified that the case was solved through information from an informant, Lu Dalin. However, according to the deceased's second brother, who came from Zhenjiang, the motive for the murder was related to the affair between the deceased and his sister-in-law. Therefore, when arresting the suspects in the case, the family members of the deceased were not notified. Next, the deceased's wife, Wang Chen, testified that she was 38 years old, a native of Zhenru Yangjiaqiao. Wang Zilin was her husband. Bao Lixue worked in her house. She did not know about her husband's murder at first. Later, her husband's elder brother, Cai Lin, received two anonymous letters and told her not to seek justice. The judge, believing that the circumstances of the case were bizarre and extremely complex, and wanting to determine whether the deceased had an affair with someone or was murdered by someone, ordered the deceased's wife to write a letter to summon her two brothers to the case for a thorough investigation. The defendants were returned to custody.

### The Municipal Council Relaxes Road Plans This Year

The Public Concession's road changes from last year, as well as this year's plans to widen or lengthen roads, have been prepared in a report by the Chief of the Works Department of the Municipal Council and submitted to the Council's Works Committee. The plan to widen Jiangxi Road is one of the most important items in the proposed plans. The current width of Jiangxi Road is 40 feet, but vehicular traffic in the middle section of the road is quite busy. Therefore, it is proposed to widen the section between Beijing Road and Fuzhou Road to 55 feet. The section south of Fuzhou Road, however, is where the Construction Building and Hamilton House are located, and widening would not be of any practical benefit. There had been a plan to widen Beijing Road to 70 feet in the past, but because the section east of Sichuan Road is now not very congested, it is proposed to maintain the existing width of 40 feet and not expand it further.

### City General Labor Union Forms Wuxi Tour Group

The coffin was also made of ordinary wood and had no valuable items. According to viewers, the deceased was from Suzhou and had been lying in the coffin for thirteen years.

### Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor,

The Kunshan dispatch titled "Re-Addiction Investigation and Bribery Case" published in your newspaper on February 14 contains some inaccuracies. As the case is under judicial investigation, it was inconvenient to send a letter to correct it. Now, upon reading the letter from Gao Guoshi of Zhengyi Town, Kunshan in the letter column of February 18, which stated that "Dean Chen Daheng instructed Yuan Kegong, a opium smoker under investigation at the hospital, to contact Guoshi on February 8," I am shocked. After investigation, on the afternoon of the 8th, Gao Zhongliang, the person under investigation, was found to be addicted. After the county handled the case, it was rumored that Gao Zhongliang, due to his anxiety about secretly smoking opium, had bribed someone and contacted Xue A'gen, a coachman of our hospital. I was deeply resentful when I heard about this, fearing that someone would falsely claim to be someone else to swindle money. I immediately reported it verbally to the county government and requested an investigation. I also investigated the actions of the coachman Xue A'gen, because he went out privately many times, which was obviously a malpractice. So on the morning of the 10th, I presented a report to the county government and sent him there to await investigation. The original report is in the county government, which is not difficult to prove. It is heard that the case will be sentenced soon, and the truth will come out. As for Gao Guoshi's accusation that I instigated it, it is intentional slander. In addition to filing a lawsuit according to law, I hereby send a letter to your newspaper to disclose the situation, so as to avoid confusion. Sincerely yours, to the chief editor of Shen Bao, Chen Daheng, Dean of Kunshan County Hospital, February 19th.

### Shi Minren's Lawsuit Against Tan Zhaohui, Her Husband of Eighteen Years

A Son Can Be Abandoned Like Old Shoes - Why Marry Mr. Du Heng?

Shi Minren, a woman from Haimen, residing at No. 5, Dingcheng Lane, Wandang Bridge, Laoximen, Shanghai, 30 years old, hired lawyer Le Junwei to sue Tan Zhaohui, a compradore of Dechang Foreign Firm, in the criminal court of the local court for obscenity. The plaintiff's purpose is that the plaintiff and the defendant are husband and wife, and have been for eighteen years. Earlier, when she was fourteen years old, she studied with him at Wanzhu Primary School in the city, and they fell in love at first sight. Therefore, from the age of seventeen, the two had lived together. In the middle, they traveled to Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin and other places, and lived in harmony. They had a son named "Nengwei." Unexpectedly, Tan recently openly published a wedding announcement in the Ta Kung Pao, knowing that Tan had asked lawyers Gu Zukuan and Zhu Shifan to prove on November 11, 1935, and married Du Hengjun at the New Asia Restaurant, and abandoned the plaintiff like old shoes. Still thinking of the eighteen years of marriage, he decided not to forget his kindness and righteousness. Therefore, he hired a lawyer to send a letter to inquire about the truth and published a notice in the newspaper to confirm the marital relationship. However, he absolutely denied the marital relationship. Therefore, his intentions are sinister, and he has long used fraud to make the plaintiff mistakenly believe that she was abandoned as her own spouse and obeyed adultery for eighteen years. Now that it has been revealed, please punish him for the crime of Article 229 of the Criminal Law. The judge opened the court for trial yesterday. The defendant did not arrive, and the lawyer claimed that he had a waist problem and was in Baolong Hospital, requesting an adjournment. The official said that he must appear in court next time, otherwise he will be arrested. The court was adjourned.

### Unification and Peace (Continued)

— Pan Gongzhan

When did the Manchu Qing Dynasty start to feel uneasy? We know that peasant uprisings were already brewing during the Qianlong period, such as the White Lotus Rebellion. Qianlong's tour to the south seemed to be the prosperous age of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, but he did not know that the signs of its defeat were gradually emerging. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, the governors and local gentry of the Manchu Qing Dynasty often turned into the governors of the revolutionary military government. The collapse of Tongshan and the response of Yuzhong; the Manchu Qing Dynasty actually perished under this situation. Therefore, at that time, not many provinces were actually conquered by the revolutionary army, but mostly civil and military officials or gentry who attached themselves to it. Take Jiangsu Province as an example, Cheng Dequan is a prominent example. Especially Yuan Shikai in the north, because he had ambitions, his subordinates, led by Duan Qirui, telegraphed to ask the Manchu Qing Dynasty to abdicate. Did they understand the Three People's Principles at that time? No, it was the cycle of history that had arrived, and the central government (Qing court) at that time had reached the point of collapse. Fortunately, the provisional government of the Republic of China was established, and the provinces that declared independence all obeyed the provisional government, and there was no division on the surface. Later, Yuan Shikai moved the capital to Beijing, and the result was that the old forces defeated the new forces. Although the old forces won, they had already reached the period of collapse of the central government, and it was impossible for him to unify by relying on the power of the warlords. After Yuan's failure, it evolved into warlord separatism, and the governor-general group appeared. What is the governor-general group? The governor-general group is a grand alliance of separatist forces. Not only could the central government not command him, but he could command the central government, and even Zhang Dong led troops to Beijing to restore the monarchy. During the Zhili-Anhui War, the Zhili-Fengtian War, and the Qi-Lu War, the highest peak of warlord separatism was formed. Fortunately, Mr. Sun Yat-sen clarified the national system of the Republic of China, there was no emperor, and these warlords dared not openly claim to be kings no matter what. Otherwise, Feng Guozhang was a king, Zhang Dong was also a king, Zhang Zuolin was also a king, and Wu Peifu was also a king. It could have turned into seventeen or eighteen countries, which would have been even more unimaginable!

This situation of military generals' separation and non-respect for the central unification did not begin in the early years of the Republic of China, and its far-reaching causes were sown in the late Qing Dynasty. But look at the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu. Before the war broke out, Li Hongzhang said, "Now, the ministers in the interior and the frontier officials in the exterior have not been able to cooperate," "The governors of the provinces cannot be of one mind and agree with each other, and the boundaries of vision are obstructed in the middle, and the situation of restraint is on the outside." When the war had begun, the Naval Yamen wanted to combine the Nanyang and Fujian Ocean fleets with the Beiyang fleet into one army. Nanyang said, "Wu Song is the key point of the Yangtze River and the sea, and warships are difficult to withdraw." Fujian Ocean said, "The wound of Ma Jiang has not yet recovered, and Taiwan's defense is even more strict?" With this kind of disunity and separatist situation, no wonder the Japanese said that after the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, Japan only fought with Li Hongzhang alone. We understand the recent century of Chinese history, understand the cycle of history, then the warlord separatism of the past twenty years after the establishment of the Republic of China, its root cause is indeed very far. But after the separation, will we always let him separate? If we always separate, China will be no less than seventeen or eighteen countries. To make it truly create a country, there is only one road to complete unification. Mencius said, "How can the world be settled? It is settled in one." Only by being settled in one can there be peace. There was the separatist rule of the heroes at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, and there must be Zhu Yuanzhang's unification. With Zhu Yuanzhang's unification, there was the peace of the founding of the Ming Dynasty: there was the separatist rule of the heroes at the end of the Sui Dynasty, and there must be Li Shimin's unification. With Li Shimin's unification, there was the peace of the founding of the Tang Dynasty. This is a definite principle. We have experienced twenty years of dissuasion and internal wars, suffered greatly, and of course hope for peace, and the only way to achieve peace is unification. This is the inevitable evolution of history, and no matter what party or faction, they cannot deny the need for peace, especially the need for unification.

How can we seek peace? Of course, we must eliminate the forces of separatism. How can we eliminate the forces of separatism? My answer is unification. The opposite of unification is separatism, and the result of separatism is war. Therefore, only by supporting the forces of unification can we eliminate all the forces of separatism and achieve true peace. This is our belief.

(3)

Perhaps some people say that seeking peace does not necessarily rely on unification, and "alliance" can also seek peace. They seem to regard alliance and 'unification' as the same thing, as if the English word United can be translated as alliance, and it is not impossible to translate it as unification. But it also seems to be regarded as two different things, so they sometimes say "seek unification with alliance." In fact, alliance and unification are like Yang Huo who looks like Confucius, there is a great difference. What is the difference? Before the alliance, there must be many units, at least two or more units, to connect and combine them, but no matter how they are united, the internal units still exist: this is called alliance. The so-called unification is to melt the original units into a whole unit after the unification movement. The original units cannot be distinguished at all. This is unification. That is, Mencius called it settling in one. Therefore, alliance and unification, seemingly similar but not really, are really not the same thing. The starting point of alliance is to recognize many units and never eliminate them; the starting point of unification is only one unit. Take a look at the history of China, is the peace after unification in the past dynasties achieved by uniting many units that coexisted? Or is it sold by unifying into one unit? The reason why China can continue to the present and become the oldest and longest-lasting country is that the spirit of "one unit" is there. If alliance can achieve peace, then we must not forget two things: the first is the provincial autonomy advocated around 1921. At that time, they wanted to unite the giants of each province, let them govern themselves in each province, and then unite again, but did they achieve peace? As a result, it was scattered. The second is the governor-general group in the fifth and sixth years of the Republic of China. The members of the governor-general group were all top-notch figures with military and financial power in their hands. Isn't the group they organized an alliance? But the result was still no peace. Why? Because both provincial autonomy and the governor-general group are separatist and anti-unification; anti-unification is anti-peace, so the result must not be peace, but prolong the situation of non-peace. Therefore, the term "alliance" sounds good on the surface, but in reality it is equal to poison with sugar coating. We want true peace, only true unification. This kind of sugar-coated poison - that is, alliance - can never get true peace. Today, everyone's interests are the same, and they reluctantly unite. Tomorrow, when the interests conflict, they will immediately turn against each other and fight. Do our people need this kind of fickle alliance? Our 450 million old people have no separate units, no one says that I am from Shandong, and the Shandong gang should form a military unit to fight the Jiangsu gang. I am from Jiangsu, and the Jiangsu gang should form a unit to fight the Zhejiang gang; no one says that we Zhejiang people should unite to fight the Guangdong gang, and the two Guangs unite to fight the two Hubs. Basically, we don't need independent units, these independent units are what the warlords want to control. This warlord controls this unit as his own system and strength; that warlord controls that unit as his own system and strength. May I ask, isn't this division and separation? This kind of division and separation, we should first admit it, and then reluctantly unite it, can we admit it? Also, they say in unison that all parties and factions should unite, but in reality they want us to recognize the so-called "Red Army" system and the so-called "Soviet" political slot of the Communist Party, and recognize it as an independent unit. Can we tolerate it? Why don't we, the common people, take out the attitude of the masters of the house and deny all their small units? We only need the entire unit of the Chinese nation and the Republic of China. With this only unit, we can maintain the entire unification of China and guarantee the country's long-term peace. As for seeking peace through alliance, or seeking unification through alliance, it is a deceptive statement.

### Yarn and Fabric

The Yarn Market Suddenly Turns Good

Indian Merchants Prepare to Receive Goods with Bullish Positions - The Current Month Rises a Full Dollar - Although the Bears Have Chips to Deliver - The Market is Not Affected in Any Way

The yarn market rose in the afternoon after falling in the morning, and the momentum turned good again. It is said that there is only one day of business left for the current month's yarn. According to market news, Indian merchants are preparing to receive goods with bullish positions. Therefore, not only are they not selling this month, but they are also continuing to buy and increase their positions, which shows their determination. At the same time, the spot yarn sales market is still active. Although the bears have a huge amount of chips to deliver, the market is not affected. As of yesterday afternoon, there were already 21,450 bales of yarn in the warehouse.

The Current Month's Yarn Actually Increases Positions

In the pre-market opening of standard yarn, all months except the current month fell across the board, and the decline was severe. Among the industry, the yarn delivered by the bears in the warehouse reached 20,007 bales as of last night. Therefore, the cautious sentiment is strong. However, the Indian merchants not only did not close their large amount of February positions, but instead came to buy. It is found that there is only one day of trading left this Monday for the current month. Seeing that the market is firm and rising, retail investors have to make up for it. The far month was driven up by it. As a result, each month fell by 6.8 cents from the closing price of the previous day, but the current month did not move. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market atmosphere was slightly tight. It was rumored in the market that a certain yarn factory had a labor dispute. The bulls still did not relax. Grade 3 yarn rebounded by 2.3 yuan, and the popularity was still strong. Until the closing of the third session, it was said that more than 1,000 bales were dragged into February again, and the market price became more firm. The spot yarn transaction still reached more than 2,000 bales, and the market gradually moved upward. As a result, each month rose by 9 cents to 1 yuan compared with the closing price in the morning. It is found that Jifeng sold 800 bales, Tongfu 600 bales, Hexing 1,300 bales, Yuan Yi 750 bales, Dachangcheng 1,650 bales, Changfeng 1,150 bales, Xiecheng 550 bales, Fukang 1,100 bales, and Dafeng 400 bales. Dafu bought 1,050 bales, Dafeng 550 bales, Jinchang 1,400 bales, Mingde 1,500 bales, Taixing 850 bales, Changyu 550 bales, Hengde 650 bales, Yuda 1,050 bales, Gengfeng 1,150 bales, and Yuan Yi 550 bales. The highest and lowest prices of the day and the closing price are listed on the left.

Spot Yarn Sales Reach More Than 2,000 Bales

The spot yarn sales are still good. It is found that the total amount bought by all gangs throughout the day is 2,047 bales. The selling price is similar to the previous day. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows.

Cotton Futures Finally Feel Unsupported

Abundant Cotton Stock in Inland - Factory Demand Also Appears Stagnant

The cotton market is trending weak, the downward trend is intensifying, the popularity is slack, and it is rumored in the market that a certain yarn factory has a slight labor dispute, and the cotton stock in the inland is still abundant. Therefore, the industry is inclined to sell together. At the same time, the current cotton factory demand is turning sluggish, and the sellers are more active. The market is falling further.

Standard Cotton Falls More Than 3 Cents

In the pre-market opening of standard cotton, because American cotton and Indian cotton were deliberately falling, it was measured that the momentum was very weak, and the people's hearts were even more depressed. And most of them were inclined to sell because the cotton stock in the inland was abundant and had not yet been shipped out, so the market situation was even more difficult to rise. As a result, each month fell by 1.5 cents to 2.3 cents compared with the closing price of the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market price was very weak, because there was a rumor of a labor dispute in a small number of yarn factories, and at the same time, the current cotton factory demand was stagnant, and the situation was even weaker. As a result, each month fell by 0.5 cents to 1.2 cents compared with the closing price in the morning. It is found that Yuda sold 1,600 piculs, Jifeng 1,200 piculs, Zhenda 1,000 piculs, Hexing 2,200 piculs, Fengtai 2,000 piculs, Yuan Yi 1,500 piculs, Runkang 1,800 piculs, Changhe 3,600 piculs, Taixing 1,800 piculs, Xingchang 1,400 piculs, Fukang 1,700 piculs, Tonghe 1,600 piculs, and Yuanxingchang 2,500 piculs. Shenchang bought 2,500 piculs, Wang Taixing 4,900 piculs, Yikang 1,400 piculs, Dafu 2,400 piculs, Hexing 1,200 piculs, Yuan Yi 1,100 piculs, Hengchang 1,200 piculs, Xinchang 1,400 piculs, and Tongji 1,000 piculs. The highest and lowest prices of the day and the closing price are listed below.

No Source of Current Cotton at All

The current cotton consumption is lonely, the factory demand is stagnant, and there is no source at all.

Statistics on Yarn Stocks in Chinese, British and Japanese Factories at the End of January

The total stock was 28,199 bales, which was an increase of 11,562 bales compared with the stock of 16,637 bales at the end of last year.

A further investigation shows that it has reached 20,700 bales as of yesterday. The types and amounts of yarn in stock are as follows (single bale unit).

American Cotton Bulls Move to Far Months

Yesterday, when American cotton opened, each month fell by 2 pound sounds to a rise of 2 pound sounds. In-field trading, because the delivery notice will be issued next Tuesday, most of the bulls in March closed and moved to far months. Although the industry and spot traders tried to buy, the sellers were even more vigorous. As for other months, they were quite quiet. The price increase of wartime materials was not noticed. At the close, cotton farmers slightly hedged, and the market was stable. It is estimated that spot fell by 1 pound sound, futures fell by 3 pound sound, British cotton spot fell by 1 point, futures rose by 1 point, Indian cotton fell at first due to the large-scale selling of short positions and the closing of long positions, and then rebounded due to the purchase of exporters and local factories. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 0.25 rupees, Aomula fell by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees, Bailuoxi fell by 1.25 to 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 19th).

According to the Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast on the 20th was that Bailuoxi was 219.5 rupees, Aomula was 202.5 rupees, and Pingguoer was 178.25 rupees, all down 0.25 rupees.

### Piece Goods

The Seasonal Cotton Cloth Sales Market is Quite Smooth

Yesterday, cotton cloth saw a rebound in both Grade 3 and standard yarn. The auction price of Qingdao piece goods remained firm. The trend of cotton cloth gradually showed progress, and the people's hearts were good because of it. Yesterday, the Tianjin gang continued to handle more than 200 bales of fine cloth with floral and bird patterns for this month, and the Zhenjiang gang also came to wholesale and add more than 200 bales of fine cloth with double dragon pearl patterns. The colored cloth shops in this street felt that there was a lack of spot fine cloth, and the stock of out-of-piece colored cloth was not thick. They competed to prepare blank cloth to meet the needs of customers, so the sales of fine cloth were the most active. Yesterday, 500 to 600 bales of Dong goods and local factory goods were sold, mostly for the delivery of goods this month. Because they are eager to use them, the business of Fuzhou, Guangdong and the Yangtze River ports is gradually increasing. There are many wholesale purchases of goods with coincidental prices, but they are limited to goods that are seasonal and will soon be sold. The goods that were sold in winter and the New Year are swept away at the bottom, and the addition is sparse. White goods and coarse cloth are consistently needed by military uniforms and inland, Guangdong and Yangtze River gangs. The labor dispute in the British company's Public Welfare Factory is delayed and the supply is insufficient, and the market is very firm.

Domestically Produced Serge Sells Well

Domestically produced Yuanzang plain serge is currently selling well. The wool industry in this street is also selling it because the arrival and stock of imported goods are limited. In addition, Chinese uniforms are mostly purchased in spring, which leads to an increase in daily sales. Among them, the Zhanghua 918 and Dalong 128 brands are selling even better, and the selling price has increased by 5 cents. For example, Zhanghua 918 sells for 3.05 yuan, and Dalong 128 sells for 3 yuan.

### Grain

The Futures Flour Market Sees Another Rebound

Yesterday, after the market opened in the morning, the market in each month showed a consistent rebound. The price of foreign wheat was unchanged in Chicago in the near term and down 1.65 cents in the far term. Canada was good for 48 points, and Liverpool was zero pence. Therefore, after the opening price, the people's hearts in each month seemed to be slightly stable. The current month is only a few days away from the end-of-month delivery (the exchange is scheduled to be auctioned until the 24th), but the chips for long and short positions have decreased. Therefore, although it was flat at first, it immediately rebounded. In March, because there were not many outsiders, a lot of outsiders absorbed it, and the market stood up. In April, outsiders bought even more smoothly, and the jump was sharper. In July, the bulls reversed and left, and the rise weakened. The current market situation is because the outside transaction is more prosperous than the customer gang, so the rise and fall are impermanent and difficult to grasp. However, in terms of facts, it must be determined by whether the actual sales are smooth or not.

Although the Spot Wheat is Greedy, There is Still a Lack of Transactions

Yesterday's futures wheat market, the market in each month showed a steady trend. The price of foreign wheat was down 0.1 cent in Chicago, up 48 points in Canada, and up 1 penny in Liverpool. When the opening price was, the foreign wheat was relatively good, and the standard of this month was recovered by the factory recently because the factory was still greedy for the spot wheat, and the spot was removed. The people's hearts in the industry inevitably turned firm. The opening prices in February, March and April were 67 cents better, and then they fluctuated. The new wheat in June and July was relatively scarce, and the long-term flour market was still popular, so it continued to be 23 cents better. The owners of the current wheat raised the price, so there was no transaction.

The Sales of Passenger Indica Rice in This Street are Still Strong

Yesterday, the sales of customer indica rice in this area were still strong, and customer transformation was still sluggish. The Shantou gang embellished it slightly, and lacked a smooth stomach for a long time. And in recent days, the arrival is booming, with more than 12,000 to 20,000 arriving every day. It is difficult to expect the market to improve for a while. However, yesterday, Japanese transformation was very active, and the owners were not in a hurry to sell, so the market was temporarily stabilized. A total of 565 bales of Hunan rice and 6,850 bales of Jiangxi rice were opened throughout the day, and most of them were handled by this street.

The River Rice Market Rebounded Slightly

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of more than thirty gangs arrived, with about 6,300 to 6,400 stones of goods, including more than twenty gangs of thin rice. The sales market in this street is still limited, and the acceptance is still slack. Only the Qingdao gang handled 400 to 500 bales of thin rice. Fortunately, the weather was overcast and rainy, and the people's hearts turned firm. Therefore, the thin rice market turned into a fixed situation, and the thick japonica rice rebounded by an angle due to the scarcity of arrivals. The future trend must be based on the acceptance and whether it is smooth or not as a shift. Duyang and Yinyuan have no honor or disgrace.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the goods arriving from various routes under the river were sparse, about sixteen or seventeen gangs. In the morning, because the rain did not stop, there were few buyers and sellers on the market, resulting in limited transactions of various goods, and the market was stable. Later, because it was seen that the Xi'an gang was actively handling the acceptance, the customer's nature turned firm.

The Yellow Soybean is Still Selling Well

- Sesame Seeds are Softening -

Yellow Soybean: Yesterday, the yellow soybean market situation, first rose and tightened due to the rise of the Dalian market, and then stabilized due to the fall of the Dalian market. A total of seventeen cars of Siping Street beans, eight cars of Bengbu beans, one car of Linhuaiguan beans, and one car of Fanjia Tun beans were opened throughout the day. The destination was oil extraction plants and inland car workshops. In addition, Shantou and others in this street handled 250 bales of Dingjiazhou beans, 2,000 bales of Hankou Zhazha beans, 200 bales of Jiujiang Late beans, 270 bales of Jiujiang Winter beans, and 300 bales of Pinghu Doudou beans.

Sesame Seeds: Yesterday, the market situation of foreign village sesame seeds was still softening. Because the foreign market situation was not good, foreign companies were observing the acceptance. The current spot of raw sesame seeds was flat.

Soybean Oilcake is Stable in the Far Term

Yesterday, the Lian city telecommunications turned good, and the futures soybean oilcake market saw a rebound and stability. However, the actual sales of current beans have been very sluggish recently, and the stock is sufficient. It is difficult for the recent standard beans to develop further. The closing was only 2 points better. There were hoarders inquiring about the far term, and it rebounded by 45 points. The actual sales of oil and cake were still okay, and the selling momentum of the firms has slowed down, which has led to the entry of short-covering and outsiders. Each month rebounded consistently, with the futures oil rising by 1.5 to 2.5 cents, and the standard cake rising by 1.5 cents. However, the Dalian market has not yet entered the track, and the future market is difficult to predict.

### Finance

The Central Bank's official postings showed no changes for both British and American currencies, and the customs gold rate remained stable. The standard gold price was still $115.40.

### Securities

Sudden Large-Scale Selling of Class A Shares

Yesterday, the market situation at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was chaotic, with mostly swap transactions. Market prices fluctuated erratically, with ups and downs. However, there was a sudden large-scale selling of Class A shares in issues 45 and 46, with many sales also in the current month. With the February settlement approaching, this phenomenon naturally indicates that those with physical shares were selling. Furthermore, Issue 47, despite having short positions in Class A shares, did not cover them at this opportunity, suggesting that Class A shares are not likely to rally in the short term. Although investor sentiment remains relatively stable, the trend appears weak. Next Monday and Tuesday, the final two days of the February futures contracts, are expected to see intense competition between the long and short positions. Yesterday's trading saw significant buying and swapping in issues 10 and 43. Issue 5 saw strong buying of both Class C and D shares for the current month. Issues 11 and 16 saw considerable selling. Consequently, although Class C and D shares rose by 30-50 cents, they gradually weakened afterward. Turning to Class A shares, there was a sudden sale of several hundred thousand shares by Issue 15, causing a drop of 1.5 cents. The changing market sentiment immediately became evident. In the afternoon session, Issue 43 continued to swap short positions, while Issue 10 continued to buy. However, selling became increasingly active, with front-month contracts falling by 20-30 cents. Later, Issues 45 and 46 simultaneously sold Class A shares, causing a sharp drop of 55 cents in the current month. Distant-month contracts also followed with a small drop of 4 cents. As a result, front-month contracts mostly rose by 10 to 25 cents. Distant-month Class B shares turned down, falling by 1 cent. Class A shares fell by 7 cents in the current month and 4 cents in distant-month contracts. The total trading volume was 5.8 million yuan. A comparative list of the resulting gains and losses follows (unit: yuan, cent unit: hundred yuan):

### Silk and Tea

Unified Sales and Transportation of Green Tea Unlikely

To develop Chinese tea's foreign trade, the Ministry of Industry previously planned to unite Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces, as well as tea merchants from various regions, to organize a National Tea Company. This was intended to unify exports and improve production, sales, manufacturing, and transportation. However, it has been learned that although the Ministry is preparing to proceed with this plan, after discussions between Committee Member Shou Jingwei and various parties, its implementation will require more time. Unified sales and transportation in Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and other provinces seem unlikely to materialize this year. The Keemun black tea will continue to be managed by the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Sales and Transportation Committee.

### Statistics

Wholesale Price Index Continues to Rise

Up 16.6% From the Same Time Last Year

Metal and Production Goods See the Largest Increases

According to a report by the National Tariff Commission, the Shanghai wholesale price index and cost of living index (Note 1) for January 1937, both increased compared to the previous month. The overall wholesale index was 121.6, up 2.4% from the previous month and 16.6% from the same month last year. This is the highest peak since January 1932, almost returning to the price levels of the early economic downturn. The categorized indices (Note 2) are compared with the previous month as follows:

Wholesale Classified Index 1: All eight categories of the index increased compared to the previous month. Among them, metals, grains, building materials, and miscellaneous items saw the largest increases. The metal category rose by 11.9%. Hardware prices continued to rise due to ongoing increases in overseas pricing. Local inventories were extremely scarce, leading to a sharp increase in sales prices. The category index has been rising steadily since July of last year, with particularly rapid increases in the last three months. The index was still at 131.3 in October of last year, then rose to 140.4 in November, 154.1 in December, and 172.4 this month, an increase of over 30% compared to October. The grain category rose by 3.4%. Although sales of wheat and domestically produced flour slowed down, resulting in price declines, the prices of various types of rice increased uniformly. For example, Suchang japonica rice saw a sharp price increase of over 20% compared to the previous month due to strong sales. Kehsien indica rice, due to a severe shortage of grain in Guangdong Province and eager purchasing, saw prices rise along with foreign rice. Imported flour also saw price increases due to shortages, and red sorghum, corn, and beans all showed the same trend due to shortages in both arrivals and inventories. The building materials category rose by 2.7%. Black bricks, glass sheets, Douglas fir, and cedar all saw price increases. The miscellaneous category rose by 2.3%. Asphalt saw a sudden increase due to strong overseas sales, and glazed paper saw a sudden increase due to a lack of spot goods. Tung oil, bean cake, white bottom leather, pig intestines, and vegetable bowls also tended towards firmness and high prices.

Wholesale Classified Index 2: This classified index is divided into two categories and six items. Its index also increased uniformly compared to the previous month. The raw materials category rose by 3.1%, while the manufactured goods category rose by only 2.0%. Among raw materials, the forest products and agricultural products categories saw the largest increases. The forest products index rose by 4.1% due to the rising prices of asphalt, tung oil, cedar, Douglas fir, and white firewood. The agricultural products index rose by 3.6%, with white rice and beans seeing price increases, and jute following the same trend. Among manufactured goods, the rate of increase for production goods was higher than for consumer goods. The production goods index rose by 4.4%, the largest increase among all categories. The index has been rising sharply in the last four or five months. The index was still at 109.1 in September of last year, but it has reached 129.9 this month, an increase of 19.1%. This is because the prices of cotton yarn and hardware in this category have risen sharply. Although yarn prices have slightly declined this month, hardware prices have continued to rise. White factory silk has also increased in price due to a shortage of raw materials and reported price increases in the United States and Japan. The consumer goods index rose by 2.0%. Domestically produced flour, green tea, coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, fresh dried salted fish, and soybean oil all saw price declines. However, red and white sugar saw frequent price increases due to large purchases by European merchants in Java and a sharp reduction in sugar inventories in the producing areas. The local association's price quotes were repeatedly raised. Although sales of silk crepe were sluggish and weak, prices still increased due to the high price of silk. Kerosene, gasoline, burlap, fine gabardine also reported price increases.

Cost of Living Index: The overall index was 120.1, up 2.2% from the previous month and 8.2% from the same month last year. This is the highest record since July 1932. All five categories of the index increased compared to the previous month, with the food category seeing the largest increase, and the other four categories seeing only slight increases. The food category rose by 4.0%, with white rice prices rising along with wholesale prices, and soybean and table salt prices also trending higher. Meat and vegetables all increased in price due to increased demand at the end of the lunar year. The clothing category rose by 0.2%, with cotton prices rising frequently in recent months, leading to increased retail prices. Fine twill fabric and zhigong ni rose slightly, while coarse cloth and fine cloth declined slightly. According to recent surveys, rent has hardly changed. The index for this month was 109.1, up only 0.1% from the previous month. The fuel category rose by 0.5%, and the miscellaneous category rose by 0.1%. The increase in these two categories was due to the price increases of coal balls and towels.

The index of each category for this month is listed below for comparison with the previous month and the same month last year.

(Note 1) The import and export price index is under revision and will be temporarily suspended from this month.

(Note 2) The wholesale price index is classified into eight categories according to the nature and use of the goods. The old categories will be retained, as in Shanghai Wholesale Price Index Table 1. A classified index is added according to the degree of processing of the goods and will be published monthly thereafter, as in Shanghai Wholesale Price Index Table 2. The categories to which each item belongs and the classified index for each month since January 1921 are detailed in the Economic Statistics Series No. 12 of this Committee.

Shen Bao Children's Special

### Laziness and Diligence

— Wan Wen

Laziness and diligence, when we see this topic, we naturally feel that laziness is a bad habit. Diligence is the opposite. If we ask the children whether they like to be lazy children or diligent children, I believe you will all answer that you like to be diligent children. However, in our daily lives, we can see that there are more lazy people than diligent people. Although they know that laziness is a bad habit, although lazy people are also working, it is just perfunctory. This situation can also be found in school life. Some students are too lazy to prepare their textbooks every day, and they do not get promoted at the end of the semester. This is the result of laziness. Of course, there are other reasons.

It is just a temporary awakening for a lazy child to change to being diligent, and he will soon return to his old ways, unless he is determined to succeed as a diligent child. However, it is difficult. It is very easy for a diligent child to become lazy. As long as you don't do as you did before, you can immediately become a lazy child. Why is this? Because laziness is too comfortable and too leisurely. Human nature loves to enjoy, while diligence is too laborious and too strenuous. People naturally don't like these.

How can we distinguish the pros and cons of laziness and diligence? Lazy people appear listless and have an unhappy attitude towards everything. Diligent people are not like this. They can not only feel the fun of working, but also enjoy the happiness of the results after working.

Therefore, I hope you children! If you were lazy children before, then now resolutely change to diligent children, and don't covet comfort and leisure. If you were diligent children before, you should be even more diligent now, and don't be tempted by comfort and leisure. Always be diligent children.

### About Han Xin's Humiliation Under the Crotch

— Wo Fo

Children, you probably all know the story about Han Xin being humiliated by crawling under someone's crotch. It is about when Han Xin was a child, he often liked to take his sword outside, with a very heroic attitude. Unexpectedly, a rogue saw him and was very dissatisfied, so he said to him: If you have the ability, use your sword to stab me, otherwise, you have to crawl under my crotch. Han Xin had no choice but to crawl under the rogue's crotch, and the people in the market all laughed. But later, the story about Han Xin being humiliated by crawling under someone's crotch was instead passed down as a historical anecdote, and everyone praised him, saying that he was able to endure.

In fact, the place we should focus on in this story is not his endurance, but his striving. His endurance was temporary shamelessness, and his striving was long-term knowing shame. Therefore, we should not learn his shamelessness, that is, even if we must temporarily endure shame, we should immediately follow that with knowing shame and engage in long-term striving. For example, if Han Xin was only shameless at the time, but did not know shame, and only endured temporarily but did not strive for a long time, he would not only suffer this humiliation of crawling under someone's crotch once, but would suffer the humiliation of crawling under someone's crotch for the rest of his life. Because he was able to know shame, and he was able to strive for a long time, he finally washed away this humiliation and also established great achievements.

Now, we are in such an environment and position, perhaps there is also a need for temporary endurance like Han Xin being humiliated by crawling under someone's crotch. But after learning Han Xin's temporary shamelessness, we must also learn Han Xin's long-term knowing shame, so that the result of our striving can wash away the shame of this endurance. This is what children should pay special attention to when hearing or telling this story.

### A Record of Little Star Hu Rongrong

— Man Zi

There are very few child stars in the Chinese film industry. In Shanghai, only Chen Juanjuan and Hu Rongrong have the best performance skills. Rongrong is younger than Juanjuan, which makes it even more commendable. She is only seven years old this year and is studying at Jing'an Elementary School. She is the class leader of the second grade of primary school. Last year, her academic performance was the best in the entire school, so she received a scholarship, which exempted her from one year's tuition. More than a thousand younger brothers and sisters were all defeated by her, so we can know that her wisdom and efforts are very promising in the future.

Her first film attempt was "Parents and Children." Although the Cultural Film Company has become a historical term, the wonderful impression she left on tens of millions of viewers will always exist. When she arrived at the Star Film Company, she first showed a little talent in "Eternal Smile." Recently, she starred in "New Year's Money." In "New Year's Money," the most moving performances are two: one is the wooden puppet soldiers' sword dance; the other is the tap dance after eating New Year's Eve dinner.

Her dance was instructed by a foreign teacher. Fortunately, she also has a tutor, her sister-in-law Ms. Gong Qiuxia, who is also good at singing and dancing, enough to help her with her usual review and learning.

Ms. Qiuxia said: "This time's filming of New Year's Money was in the cold winter and at midnight. The weather was so cold that she had to wear thin dance clothes, which froze her teeth to chatter. She endured it, understood the plot, and listened to the director's instructions, singing and dancing, not at all less than her usual practice at home. This little girl, whose milk teeth have not dried yet, is able to devote herself to art so wholeheartedly that even I admire her. Therefore, after the completion, everyone congratulated her, and the director even gave her the honor of genius."

Genius, of course, can make a person achieve success quickly, but learning is also an indispensable fertilizer. I hope her guardians will pay attention to this point and not let a very promising star end here.

### A Letter from Jill to Mr.

— Shi Peng

—Report on Life During Vacation

Mr.:

It has been ten days since I left you. Perhaps you are anxious to know about my life these ten days!

Originally, my work plan during the winter vacation, in addition to reviewing my own homework, the remaining time would be spent according to what you instructed us: "Do more things that are beneficial to people." For this sentence, I had repeatedly pondered in my mind; if a person does it alone, I am afraid that he will feel lonely and inevitably make mistakes. So, on the second day of the vacation, I went to discuss with Mingsheng, and he very much agreed with my proposal - to do it together. At that time, we formulated two tasks to do every afternoon. What are those two tasks? First, teach those workers one lesson every day; second, report the major events of the country to them on the same day. Since the implementation of these two tasks, we have been taking turns to do them. The most worthy thing to tell you is that every time we go to their home, they not only do not dislike us, but are very happy to welcome us! I think the reason is probably that every time we go, we do not interfere with their work!

Later, when we meet on the street, we greet each other very warmly. I remember that in the first few days when we went to their home, they often told us how difficult their lives were, but they no longer talked to us about it later. Recently, they also hated those madmen who acted as guides for the enemy in the Shaanxi Incident. Mr., I have written a lot, let's talk again! I wish you

Happiness

Your student Jill Shang on the 20th

### Song of Returning Spring

— You Si Xing Yuan

Spring is back!

A glimmer of life has been revealed in the universe,

Two or three white ducks are playing in the heart of the lake,

The forest contains the goddess of spring.

In a blink of an eye; the gentle breeze is blowing, the spring is bright,

There are also swallows chirping in the green shade,

Peach and plum blossoms compete for beauty, and hundreds of flowers are in bud,

Butterflies are flying in the lush grass.

Spring is the most joyful time,

But I am worried that spring will come and go again!

There is no feast in the world that does not end,

Spring is gone; it just leaves people with sweet memories.

Children's Creation

### Snowy Morning

— Wu Pinxian, a 5th grader from Zhiben Elementary School

One morning, when I was sleeping soundly, I suddenly heard the clock strike six times. I hurriedly put on my clothes and went for a walk in the backyard. The ground and the withered branches were covered with a layer of snow. Those flowers and plants that lacked resistance had all withered. Only the plum blossoms in the east of the garden were able to muster their spirits, resist the frost and snow, and present their quiet posture, which is truly admirable! I wandered around the flowers several times, and I felt that the Suiyuan Province in northern China is now being harassed by pseudo-bandits. A group of loyal and brave soldiers are fighting the enemy unyieldingly in the cold ice and snow. Their spirit is truly like plum blossoms.

### What did you use to calculate the time when there were no clocks?

— Zai Xiang

When we go on a trip to the countryside, if we don't bring a watch, can we still know the time at that time? Perhaps a few experienced children can tell the approximate time by looking at the length of people's shadows, but if it is cloudy, there is no way.

Let's think back to ancient times. When there were no clocks, how did they calculate the time? What did they use to calculate the time? This is a very interesting and worthy of discussion question:

In the beginning, people didn't count time in one or two hours, but only "one day," which meant that the sun rose in the east and set in the west once.

Later, because there were more businesses, it was felt that counting time in one day was too simple, so some people came up with several more advanced methods of counting time.

(1) Candle Clock: This is a kind of timekeeping device used at night (see Figure 1). It is a special candle with five grids carved on it. One grid can burn for one watch of time, so it is called a candle clock; when this candle is completely burned, it is exactly five watches of time, and people get up to work at this time.

(2) Copper Pot Drip: This timekeeping device has many shapes, but the general shape is always similar (see Figure 2): a trapezoidal frame is used, with five water-leaking buckets placed on it. Water drips from the top to the bottom bucket, which is called one day or one night. This is more advanced than "candle clock".

The above two are the most popular in our country, but there are more than these two, such as: "Measuring the sun's shadow with a bamboo pole", "Cock's crowing" etc. Before there were clocks abroad, they also used this kind of simple timekeeping device, such as: water clock, sand clock (similar to our country's drip)...etc.

In short, before the invention of anything, there is always an interesting process, such as: "How did they make fire before there were matches?" "How did they do it at night before there were electric lights and kerosene lamps?" ... If we just think about it, we will develop an interest in studying the history of human life.

### Justice (5)

— Qing

But those sharks were always entangling them, unwilling to let go. Again and again, they heard cries of agony, and they could see the seawater gradually turning red, knowing that the sailors hanging on the side of the lifeboat were being snatched away by the sharks one by one. Finally, only six people remained. The first mate glanced into the boat and stopped paddling. It turned out that one of his legs had also been bitten off by a shark at that moment, but in order not to alarm the sailors, he gritted his teeth and endured the pain, never making a shout or groan. Therefore, the sailors did not know what had happened until his second leg was bitten off, and he could not help but cry out in pain. At the same time, his hands gripping the side of the boat also let go. Immediately, two people grabbed him and pulled him into the boat. He lay there, trembling with pain, but still concerned about the safety of the sailors. He called the youngest sailor, Wilson, over, precisely because he was the youngest, he took extra care of him, so that he would be less in danger. In the first mate's mind, only he might survive this time. So, the first mate solemnly instructed him to tell the Secretary of the Navy when he returned that they had gone to Ang Tau Wah to search for pirates but had unfortunately encountered danger. He continued, "Tell the Secretary of the Navy that my sailors have fulfilled their responsibilities, and they are blameless. In addition, I have one more request, which is to ask him to promote Maeldler to gunner."

After he finished speaking, he shook hands with the sailors one by one to bid farewell and struggled to say some optimistic words to encourage them; however, he had been exposed to the scorching sun all day long and had been without food or drink, so he was already exhausted and had no strength to speak. At sunset, the sharks attacked again. The sailors screamed and busied themselves, quickly capsizing the lifeboat again. And the first mate's suffering ended in the towering waves.

This brave first mate, Edward Smith, came from Hampshire and was the most beloved and promising son in his family, raised by a widowed and loving mother. Since joining the navy, he had been highly regarded by Sir Hastings, the Secretary of the Navy. But seeing him in the midst of life-and-death danger, still maintaining a calm attitude, directing his subordinates to fulfill their responsibilities, knowing only others and not himself, this great spirit is very sufficient to be a model for young people.

### A Record of Round-the-World Air Travel (Part 2)

— Translated by Dr. Falconer of America

At 7:22 PM on November 1st, we flew to Wake Island and learned that the China Clipper would be flying to Manila from there, carrying only two passengers this time. At 6:00 AM the next morning, the China Clipper set off for Guam. Shortly after, we received a wireless telegram saying that it had been forced to return to Wake Island due to encountering a hurricane en route. Pan American Airlines had built hotels on Guam, Wake Island, and Midway Island, all equipped with electric lights and private bathrooms, making passengers very comfortable, and the meals were also extremely exquisite. At 6:16 AM on Monday, November 2nd, a few minutes after the China Clipper departed, we also left Wake Island for Midway Island. This leg of the flight was 1185 miles long and we arrived at 4:05 PM on Sunday, November 1st. Why did we fly for a day and go back a day? This is because the 180th meridian west is the International Date Line. The days on Earth are counted from this line. This line is very close to the west of Midway Island. If it is Sunday, November 1st, just west of this date line, it is still Sunday, November 1st, to the east of this line. Therefore, the two days we spent were both Sunday, November 1st.

The Pacific Commercial Cable Company has established a cable station on Midway Island for 33 years, with approximately 18 employees. The company has planted many pine trees, Australian gum trees, hibiscus trees, and other trees and flowers on the island. The pine trees and gum trees are already up to 50 feet tall. Pan Pacific Airlines will now station approximately 18 employees on the island, so the total population on the island will be about 35 people. Currently, there is only one woman. The current supervisors of the Pacific Commercial Cable Company's Honolulu branch, Mr. Frazer and Mr. McMichael, brought two donkeys, one male and one female, to the island in 1904 when they were working on Midway Island for recreational riding during their spare time. A few years later, they were transferred to the nearby East Island branch. These two donkeys, along with some small donkeys, and a lot of food, were taken along. They dug a well on the island to provide drinking water for the donkeys, but the donkeys refused to drink the well water. They dug a pool in the sand a little further from the beach with their hooves and drank the black water inside. The donkeys initially relied on the leaves of the trees on the island for food, but before long, the trees were plagued by insects and withered. As a result, more than 20 donkeys died, leaving only three.

Every autumn, a large number of sooty terns fly from the Aleutian Islands to Midway Island to spend the winter, divided into black and white varieties. We only saw many black ones, and the white ones will fly in a little later. Each female tern digs a nest in the sand, lays a very large egg in the nest, and incubates the egg until the chick hatches before leaving. Then both male and female terns feed the chick, guarding it very carefully. When the chick is able to move a few feet away from the nest, the terns will no longer feed it. When building the hotel on the island, the trucks transporting materials moved many chicks away and marked the nests, putting the chicks back in the nests after the trucks passed to prevent them from starving to death.

At 6:10 AM on November 2nd, we departed from Midway Island and flew 1304 miles before arriving in Honolulu at 5:12 PM, landing at Pearl Harbor. This was the most interesting leg of the entire journey. The islands along the way stretched endlessly, green and dazzling. Several islands were about 200 feet above sea level. The loveliest scenery of the entire trip was looking down from the plane at a distance of one or two miles and seeing the shadow of the plane, like a big bird, flying in the clouds, surrounded by a circular, beautiful rainbow. At noon on November 18th, I departed from Honolulu, flew to Alameda on the morning of the 19th, departed again at noon, and landed safely in Dallas at 5:00 PM, completing the round-the-world flight. I can be considered the first person to travel around the world by commercial airplane. The entire journey was 26,080 miles, and excluding the cost of living in the East for five months, the total travel expenses were US$3,355. The actual flying time was 16 days.

### Bowing Diplomacy

— I

According to yesterday's report, at the general meeting of the House of Representatives the day before yesterday, the congressmen successively questioned the government, and the most valuable questioning was that of Mr. Ozaki Yukio, an old Japanese politician. His expressions regarding military reduction and diplomacy were direct and incisive, and those who listened were moved. The second was the questioning speech of Nakano Seigo, which lasted for two and a half hours. From the sharp words of their questioning, the cabinet and the military obviously exposed different political views and destructive rifts, but how the two sides will win or lose in the end remains to be seen in the next episode.

What I want to talk about here are a few very novel statements in Nakano Seigo's speech, which I will highlight. He said that Foreign Minister Hayashi Gonsuke's diplomacy, whether towards China or towards the United Kingdom and the United States, uniformly practiced goodwill and bowed in all directions, which could be called bowing diplomacy. However, diplomacy and the sentiment of goodwill are still another issue, and so on. Such words are somewhat understandable and somewhat peculiar. A country's politics naturally has a country's national policy, and a country's diplomacy naturally has a country's policy. Therefore, the diplomatic practices of various countries are only to adhere to their diplomatic objectives, organize their diplomatic steps, and mediate disputes. However, Japan's diplomacy has been constantly innovating, with nothing impossible. According to what has been seen in newspapers recently, there is one-dollar diplomacy, guan dispute diplomacy, duck diplomacy, and now there is so-called bowing diplomacy. However, I do not quite believe in the words "bowing diplomacy." In recent years, Japan has been flaunting its power and ignoring the world. Its arrogance has been so great that countries around the world can only sigh and dare not speak. How could it want to use bowing diplomacy? It is still understandable to use bowing diplomacy towards the United Kingdom and the United States, but how could it also use bowing diplomacy towards China? It is truly outrageous.

However, since bowing diplomacy is used, it should lead to the result of goodwill. Why does he also say that diplomacy and the sentiment of goodwill are still another issue? Then even if one bows completely, one will not get the result of goodwill. What is the reason for this? However, on the one hand, they keep bowing, and on the other hand, they keep implementing their cannon policy. Therefore, the more they bow, the more they feel the sentiment is getting worse. However, I believe that Nakano Seigo's so-called bowing diplomacy is not aimed at foreign countries, but at domestic affairs. The opinions of the Japanese political groups and the military are becoming more and more disparate, and the contact is becoming more and more serious. The foreign minister is truly in a position of "it's difficult to please everyone." If he respects Party A's wishes, he will clash with Party B. If he respects Party B's wishes, he will clash with Party A. Therefore, Mr. Ozaki Yukio said that the lack of unity in diplomatic policy is the root of the problem. The three ministries of foreign affairs, army, and navy, as well as the personnel stationed in China, each have their own expressions and views. How can they make others believe in Japan? Therefore, Foreign Minister Hayashi Gonsuke's bowing diplomacy is better directed towards both domestic parties rather than towards China, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

### Lantern Festival

— Tian Qing

Snowflakes danced madly on the grand stage of the universe. The wilderness, fields, buildings, and trees... were all draped in radiant, immaculate coats; yet they also faintly revealed the misery of being unable to resist the invasion of the cold.

Little girl Moujia's thatched hut was covered into a small snow mountain. There were several gaps in the house through which snowflakes drifted in. The weather was so cold that people shivered, but little girl Moujia did not care about this, single-mindedly absorbed in playing with that little lantern; Christmas Eve had been quietly taken away by Father Time, and the lantern had not been lit. Now the Lantern Festival was coming again, but the little lantern was still empty, without a single small candle. Thinking that without a candle, the lantern could not be lit, a layer of light anxiety inevitably seeped into her small, joyful heart. She looked up at her grandmother, wanting to ask her why her grandfather had not returned yet.

For the past two years, the grandmother had often maintained an extraordinary expression: she seemed to be staring at something: yet as if she had not seen anything at all, she remained silent. The wrinkles on her face, worn smooth by life, and the sparse, almost bald temples! etched with the pain of infinite worries and memories.

This kind of incomprehensible stillness melted Moujia's anxious, passionate heart. She quietly lowered her head again to caress her beloved "treasure."

"Why hasn't grandfather returned yet?" The little girl looked at the sky for a while, and couldn't help but ask her grandmother again.

That answer often failed to satisfy Moujia. In fact, she was particularly concerned about her grandfather today, because her grandmother had told her that her grandfather had gone to buy Lantern Festival gifts and small candles for Moujia.

The sky grew darker step by step, and the snowflakes took advantage of the wind's madness, becoming even more violent and powerful, forming enchanting nets in bursts. Old Grandfather still had not returned. The grandmother was even less able to answer Moujia's questions, even muttering to herself in a daze.

——This caused Moujia to have great doubts: "Is it that the snow is too heavy, confusing grandfather's way home?"

Logically, the little girl being so sensible, her longing for her grandfather would make the grandmother happy enough to shed tears. She would pick Moujia up: kiss her wise little eyes, and her dark, shining soft hair, praying to the Bodhisattva to grant Moujia greater and more beautiful blessings. But at this moment, she only shook her head slightly, stubbornly maintaining that dazed silence.

Suddenly, the grandmother knelt on the ground, tremblingly clasping her hands in prayer: "Bodhisattva... God bless

Moujia's old grandfather's safety... May you absolve the souls of Moujia's parents... Grant this poor child greater and more happiness..."

Why was grandmother always praying to the Bodhisattva to absolve the souls of Moujia's parents? The little girl could not understand at all, and the impression of her parents had gradually faded and been forgotten in her memory. However, at this moment, the grandmother's attitude made a little terror arise in her innocent heart, sensing that this would be an unfortunate arrival.

A gust of violent wind, carrying clumps of snowflakes, rudely burst open their door: the grandmother and everything in the house trembled at the same time. But Moujia cried out in joy: "Ah, he's back! Grandfather is back!" The little girl busily ran towards the door, ready to welcome her kind grandfather. When she realized that there was no shadow of anyone there, she closed the door heavily again in disappointment and anger, fretting there.

The sound of firecrackers in the distance, carried in the wind, should be the time when the Bodhisattva descended to the palace: the "lantern parade" should also be about to set off—the drawn-out lantern frame like a wandering dragon, all kinds of beautiful lanterns... A heat surged in the little girl's heart, and she also thought of the excitement of "burning fire clouds" and "burning fire treasures" (a special custom in the countryside, using burning firewood to express prosperity)...

Heavy and urgent knocking interrupted Moujia's fantasy. The little girl did not delay at all, quickly opened the door, letting the sharp cold wind push in her old grandfather.

The old man who came in had strings of snowbells hanging on his clothes, hat, the small cloth bag on his shoulder, and his white beard, emitting a glittering light under the dim light in the house - this made the little girl's sharp inspiration suddenly recall Santa Claus in the church, and she cried out in surprise and jumped over to grab the old man's frozen hand, asking him if he had brought back the small candles.

Only then did the old grandmother awaken and run over, shaking the snowflakes off the old man's face, and at the same time noticing that the small cloth bag on his shoulder, soaked by the snowflakes, was still empty, and a desperate cry resounded deeply in her heart: "Didn't you borrow any food?"

The old grandfather leaned against the door panel with all his might, panting urgently and weakly, his whole body trembling with cold and hunger. Moujia was still clamoring for the small candle to light the lantern, because tonight was the Lantern Festival!

Opening "Liu Yi"

Peach blossoms are like embroidery, willows are like gold. Zhang Xu invites Liu Yi to go. Both have talent and beauty. They were classmates and from the same hometown. Strolling together to find poetic verses. Walking leisurely near the seaside. Seeing a. Shepherdess with a look of sorrow. Shy away from others and frightened when seeing people. The clothes are not like ordinary women. A kind of elegance and charm is wonderful. Bored, ask the charming lady. What family background might you try to say? The charming appearance is not like a shepherd. Hiding her shyness, she picks up her robe and says softly. The whisper is like a nightingale coming out of the valley. Because my father is angry. Today I ask to send a message. The rhinoceros hairpin on my head can be used as proof. The big tree by the river can be the door. As directed and as described. There is indeed a shade of a big tree by the river. Lightly knock a few times. I did not know that this hairpin was made of rhinoceros horn. In an instant, it can separate the sea water. Crystal palace, glazed throne. See the crown-wearing person on the throne. The emperor was shocked and angry. Since this is the case, how can I allow it? Discussing marriage does not hinder the separation of the underworld. The croaking of the alligator drum is a harmonious sound. Entering the Dragon Palace before Dongting Lake.

### Star Magazine

The "Street Angel," directed and written by Yuan Muzhi, entirely depicts the lifestyles of the lower classes in a large city, such as barbers, news vendors, wind instrumentalists, musicians, prostitutes, madams...etc., a wide variety, forming a grand spectacle. It is a comedy with an original new style of domestic film.

The "Crossroads," directed and written by Shen Xiling, has been completely finished and passed by the Nanjing Film Censorship Board. It depicts the trilogy of modern youth's lack of education, love, and employment. The plot is deeply touching, and the director's achievement is particularly good. There is a famous song "In Spring" in it, which is full of Eastern folk song sentiment and is extremely moving. The lyrics are a collaboration between Guan Lu and He Luting, and the music is composed by He Luting.

"Dreams of the World," a collaboration between Cheng Bugao and Tan Ying again, is scheduled to start filming within a week. The script is by the famous playwright Professor Hong Shen. The plot is novel and vivid, writing about the different dreams that the men, women, masters, and servants in a large family have on the winter solstice night. The script has been reviewed and approved by the central government and has received praise.

"Vigorous Dragon and Lively Tiger," directed and written by Xu Xin, has recently been completed. The final scene of the great battle between the police and bandits involved requesting the local garrison in Suzhou to participate in the performance. All guns and cannons were fired with live ammunition, making it extremely tense and adding a lot of color to the film.

### A Scene from "Street Singing"

### Minxin News

Mrs. Chen Danyi, the wife of Jin Qingyu, gave birth to a daughter in Nanjing. Jin took advantage of his free time to rush to Nanjing to offer his condolences.

Wang Guilin's attitude towards acting has always been serious and never slackened. His previous films such as "Humanity" and "City Night" have long been praised by society. Recently, the role he played in "New Humanity" is a re-enactment, so he is even more serious. Therefore, there is no doubt that his performance will be outstanding.

In recent days, "New Humanity" is filming scenes of famine and starvation, with people cooking and eating grass roots. Because Lin Chuchu, Li Keng, Li Xi, Wang Guilin, and others played it, the tragic scene made the spectators on the spot feel touched and shed tears.

In the scene of "New Humanity" filming in a hotel, Hu Rong and Dai Yanwan fought for Liang Saizhu. Hu Rong originally had the upper hand, punching Dai Yanwan so hard that he was dizzy and his fingers were also cut. But in the blink of an eye, Liang Saizhu slapped Hu Rong in the face. Although it was acting, it was a completely serious way of fighting. Fighting for a woman should be called a combination of soft and hard performance.

### "Resurrection" to Be Brought to the Screen

Tolstoy's "Resurrection" is a world-renowned masterpiece, an immortal masterpiece. In foreign countries, many famous novels have been brought to the screen, and "Resurrection" is no exception. "Resurrection" has even set a new record, having been filmed four times before.

Now, Tianyi director Zuo Ming is burying himself in writing the script for "Resurrection." As soon as it is completed, it will be sent to Beijing for review.
