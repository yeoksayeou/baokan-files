### With Blood and Flesh, Advancing Without Retreat, Our Army Again Occupies the Enemy Naval Training Ground

Enemy Forces Lose Contact Successively, Situation Isolated; Newly Built Base Surrounded by Our Army; Fierce Battle in Pudong the Night Before, Enemy Suffers Significant Damage

The invading Japanese army in Shanghai, having repeatedly suffered defeats and retreated steadily, was subjected to a fierce attack by our land and air forces on the evenings of the previous two days. They have now effectively abandoned their three important military bases. Although reinforcements have been frequently added, the situation is ultimately hopeless and futile. In particular, the enemy flagship Izumo was bombed by us and quietly moved away for repairs. It is evident that the enemy's courage has been shattered and their end is near. However, the enemy, with a large army gathered, is urgently attempting to land in Pudong. But after the bloody battle the night before, they suffered more than half casualties and retreated with broken wings. The enemy forces in the Lower East District and the headquarters on Jiangwan Road have been surrounded by our layers. Although the remnants in the headquarters still hope to defend their position with their solid fortifications, it will not be difficult to sweep them away in one fell swoop. The collapse of the stubborn enemy is only a matter of time.

Victories for Our Army on All Fronts in the Eastern District

Our Army Occupies Naval Training Ground

In the past two days, the Japanese army has successively abandoned its two important military bases: the Shanghai Eastern Public University, the First Cotton Mill, and the Japanese Naval Headquarters on Doulean Road. The only thing they relied on to struggle was a Japanese naval training ground near the Fanjiatai area south of Hongzhen. They frequently covered both wings, advancing towards the Yinxianggang and Jiangwan areas. Our army launched a full-scale attack at around 7 a.m. yesterday, engaging completely in close combat with blood and flesh. The enemy forces were unable to withstand it and retreated steadily. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue and, at 8:30 a.m., completely occupied the enemy's only base, adding another glorious page to the history of the Shanghai war. Our side suffered some losses in this battle, but the enemy suffered even greater injuries. The communication between the enemy's navy and army has been controlled by our army.

According to the Central News Agency, the enemy naval training ground occupied by our army yesterday morning is a strategically important area. Since the enemy abandoned the Public University Cotton Mill and the two headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road, the naval training ground has become the center of the entire army and can cover both wings. After being occupied by our army, the enemy forces have lost their center of gravity. In this offensive, our army fought with blood and flesh and suffered considerable losses. The enemy forces resisted desperately, suffering even greater injuries.

Enemy's New Base Surrounded

Reliable information reveals that after the enemy forces abandoned the Public University Cotton Mill, they retreated to the Dinghai Road and Tengyue Road area and built a new base at the Yufeng and Dakang cotton mills and the American-run water and electricity plant. Yesterday morning, our army took advantage of the victory and advanced in two routes. The enemy was defeated miserably. A portion of them is still stubbornly resisting at the power plant, but they have been surrounded by our army and it will not be difficult to resolve. According to the Central News Agency, after the Yangshupu enemy forces collapsed at the Public University Cotton Mill, they used the power plant between the Yufeng Cotton Mill and the Dakang Cotton Mill as a new base. Our left-wing army advanced along the Huangpu River, taking advantage of the victory. By about 2 p.m., they had surrounded the factory and were annihilating the stubbornly resisting remnants.

No Enemy Traces in the Chinese Area of Eastern Shanghai

After the enemy retreated from the Yufeng and Dakang cotton mills and surrounded the area near the American-run power plant to form a new base, our army continued to pursue and attack. The enemy forces, barely able to catch their breath, did not dare to resist and retreated to the concession area in the southwest direction. Our army's front line in the eastern district reached the Yangshupu Bridge at 2:50 a.m. today, so there are no enemy traces in the Chinese area of that district. At the same time, the Wooden Hall received a report from the Aiguo Road area stating that our army was seen passing through the Aiguo Road area at around 2 a.m. this morning, pressing the enemy.

Frequent Reports of Victory from All Fronts

(Central News Agency) After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, our army immediately adopted a large encirclement formation and launched fierce attacks on the enemy's left and right wings. Japanese soldiers in the Yangshupu area have retreated to the power plant behind the Yufeng Cotton Mill, regrouping their remnants and building new defenses. On the North Sichuan Road side, after we captured Hongkou Park, the enemy Marine Corps headquarters has been surrounded, with isolated troops trapped and stubbornly resisting in their military buildings. The main position on the front line is the naval training ground near Fanjiatai, south of Hongzhen, which frequently attacks our Jiangwan area, but has been repelled by our army. Last night, the enemy used warships and heavy artillery to cover their counter-offensive in an attempt to salvage the critical situation, but they did not succeed. According to reports from the front line this morning, our army launched a fierce charge at dawn, engaging in several close-quarters combats. The enemy finally could not withstand it and retreated to the south of Yuezhou Road at 8:30 a.m. The enemy's entire line has retreated into the concession area.

(Central News Agency) The fierce artillery battle that began at 6 p.m. on the 16th only subsided at 2 a.m. on the 17th. At 5 a.m., the sound of heavy artillery and machine guns roared again, stopping at about 9 a.m. It is reported that the defeated enemy forces are trying to recover lost ground and counter-attack us from all directions. Our loyal and brave soldiers responded calmly, firmly defending their positions, unmoved. The enemy forces on all fronts suffered heavy losses and retreated in defeat. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, with the central route advancing especially bravely, occupying the naval training ground near Fanjiatai at 8:30 a.m. The enemy has completely retreated into the concession. Now, our central route is connected with the left and right wings, and the enemy headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road has lost contact with the enemy's rear, forming an isolated situation. Our army on all fronts is advancing opportunistically, and a major result is expected within a day or two.

We Occupy the Club Three Times

(Central News Agency) The Japanese Naval Club at the end of North Sichuan Road is one of the enemy's key bases. It was occupied by our army on the 15th, then withdrawn. It was occupied again on the 16th, then withdrawn again. At about 8 a.m. yesterday morning, our □□ Division □□ Regiment continued to attack, advancing through a dense hail of enemy bullets, bathing in blood. They occupied the club for the third time. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. Our army is now pursuing the victory on one hand and building fortifications on the other.

Enemy Positions Shrink Smaller and Smaller

The connection between the enemy headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road and its rear is under serious threat from our army. Currently, our entire line has shrunk all enemy positions smaller and smaller, completing a large encirclement. Furthermore, because our front line has advanced, the enemy's artillery has completely lost its power. Therefore, the battles in the past two days have not been as often filled with thunderous artillery fire as the first two days. It has become a skirmish, with only enemy ships and our artillery occasionally exchanging fire. However, the enemy ships' artillery fire is not as fierce as heavy artillery, so our army's losses are minimal. It is expected that if there are no other changes, all enemy forces can be resolved in the short term. Yesterday, our commander Zhang Zhizhong personally went to the front line to direct and supervise the battle, greatly boosting morale.

Enemy Naval Attaché's Office Hit

Starting at 5 a.m. yesterday morning, our army bombarded the enemy forces in the Hongkou area with heavy artillery. The artillery fire was dense and the targets were accurate. By about 8 a.m., the enemy's naval attaché's office and the Japanese elementary school were hit by our heavy artillery and caught fire, burning fiercely. The enemy forces were extremely chaotic and almost disintegrated.

Enemy Forces Seem to be Abandoning Hongkou

According to a Central News Agency report, the enemy forces in the important areas of Donghanbili Road and Dongyouheng Road in this city, as well as Jianzhai, etc., were hurriedly burying landmines on the night of the 17th, seemingly about to abandon Hongkou.

Detailed Account of the Fierce Battle in Pudong the Night Before

Since the exchange of fire between enemy ships and our garrison in Pudong the night before, the Japanese army clearly had other important plots, causing the situation in Pudong to suddenly become tense. At 10 a.m. yesterday, the two sides exchanged artillery fire fiercely again. At 11:30 a.m., seven enemy planes bombed our Pudong defenses indiscriminately, causing considerable losses, but our army was not moved. Our reporter personally went to Pudong yesterday afternoon to investigate, and the details are recorded as follows:

Xinma Road Has Become a Battlefield

At 10:30 p.m. the night before, the sound of machine guns and artillery fire started again and became more intense. The two sides made contact in the Dongchang Road and Xinwei Road area, each using artillery to cover their advance. The battle was extraordinarily fierce. Our army fought bravely, driving back the enemy forces. The enemy forces broke through four times, but all failed. They were ultimately forced to retreat to the Mitsui Coal Yard. In this battle, because of the fierce artillery fire between the two sides, the Wu Family Ancestral Temple was completely destroyed. Places such as the Fifteen Rooms and the Eighteen Rooms were the focus of artillery fire for both sides. The area along Xinma Road has become a battlefield. Our army advanced, surrounding the enemy. However, because there were many obstacles in the area and the enemy forces were defending from a high position, it was not easy to resolve them for a while.

Japanese Soldiers Landing Repelled by Our Army

The Japanese army plotted to take action in the Pudong area. Their marines, estimated at about four to five hundred men, landed at the Qichang Pier under the cover of enemy ships' artillery fire at around 7 p.m. the night before, using the Mitsui Coal Yard and the Nichiwa Cotton Mill as bases. Upon learning of this, our garrison immediately advanced, determined to drive them out. A fierce battle immediately erupted between the two sides. Our side launched a fierce attack on the Mitsui Yard and the Nichiwa Cotton Mill, while using machine guns to strafe the Japanese soldiers landing in Pudong. At that time, the enemy forces could not advance or retreat. Countless people who dropped their guns and drowned in the river and an unknown number were shot down by our army. After two hours of fierce fighting, the enemy ultimately failed, suffering heavy casualties. Our side suffered more than a dozen casualties. However, the coastal areas such as Yangjing in Pudong suffered slight damage due to the indiscriminate firing of guns by Japanese warships.

Japanese Factories and Warehouses Hit by Shells

Starting at 10 a.m. yesterday morning, the two sides exchanged artillery fire again. Our artillery team returned fire at the enemy warships in the Huangpu River, exchanging fire across the river. One of our shells hit the Huishan Wharf. In Pudong, the Nichiwa Cotton Mill, the Mitsui Coal Yard, etc., were also hit by shells and bombed. The Ice Factory Field was also hit by a shell.

Nearly a Thousand Enemy Soldiers Eliminated, More Than Half

According to military sources, the night before, about 500 enemy soldiers and about 200 plainclothes soldiers landed at the Xinbing Wharf (opposite the Shanghai Waterworks in the Public Concession) under the cover of enemy warships' artillery fire. They were immediately ambushed and surrounded by our garrison. After several hours of fierce fighting, more than half of them were eliminated. A small portion of the rest retreated miserably. Also, at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong the night before, several hundred enemy soldiers landed, attempting to occupy a new position in Pudong. After being defeated by our army, there were still more than one hundred people stubbornly resisting in the warehouses there. They are currently being surrounded.

According to the Central News Agency, at about 3 a.m. yesterday morning, more than 500 enemy marines landed at the Mitsui Wharf in Pudong under the cover of artillery fire, firing fiercely at us with machine guns and small steel cannons. Our army fought bravely and finally drove the enemy back, fleeing hastily onto ships and escaping to the Yangshupu area.

### Enemy Aircraft Bomb Our Army Positions

One Plane Shot Down and Burned; One of Our Planes Also Hit and Damaged

Yesterday morning, dark clouds covered the sky, and drizzle fell, providing another opportunity for the air force to operate. Before 11 a.m., in addition to continuously patrolling the Huangpu River to scout the movements of enemy warships and enemy forces, at 11:15 a.m., two of our air force bombers flew over the Huangpu River again to bomb enemy warships. Outside the Garden Bridge, a battle broke out in the sky with two enemy planes, which was extremely fierce. For a time, the sound of machine guns was as dense as a string of beads, and the enemy warships' anti-aircraft guns fired wildly. After six or seven minutes of combat, our planes flew away in different directions to the northwest. At 11:45 a.m., our air force squadron reappeared in the sky, flying at top speed, bombing enemy forces in the Yangshupu area, causing considerable losses to the enemy positions. Afterwards, two enemy fighters flew and patrolled over the Huangpu River from time to time. At 3 p.m., more than 20 enemy planes flew in teams to bomb the North Railway Station and Macheng Road area. Our air force also went out to respond to the battle, and the enemy planes hastily dropped their bombs and fled, it is said.

Bombing Enemy Warships, Our Plane Damaged

Yesterday, our air force continued to sortie. At 10:30 a.m., two of our planes flew to the sky over the Huangpu River to bomb the enemy flagship Izumo. In panic, the enemy fired anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns wildly into the sky. Our plane climbed high into the clouds, circled several times, and flew west. At 11 a.m., our air force sortied again, flying extremely low. In the Yangshupu area, they strafed with machine guns. The enemy's anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns fired together. Smoke filled the sky. Unfortunately, one of our planes was damaged, and its tail caught fire. It was forced to land. The other planes returned safely. Our army continued its efforts and flew in again at about 2 p.m. for reconnaissance, it is said.

Large Numbers of Enemy Planes Bomb Zhabei

Yesterday afternoon at about 2 p.m., the enemy first sent three seaplanes to scout our Zhabei area. Our army's anti-aircraft guns and machine guns fired together. The enemy planes escaped into the clouds after about ten minutes. Before half an hour had passed, enemy land-based biplane fighters and bombers flew from the north in five small groups, each team with three planes, totaling fifteen planes. They flew extremely high. When they reached the sky over Zhabei, they suddenly scattered. At the same time, the enemy used nine fighter planes flying high as cover, and six bombers took turns bombing our positions, constantly. At that time, the tactic adopted by each plane was that the six planes first flew in a circle in the high sky of the enemy's position. When flying to the east side, they suddenly turned sharply to the west and descended rapidly. After dropping the bomb, our army flew north again at high speed and then east, forming a semicircle. Thus, they circulated endlessly, taking turns dropping bombs. After half an hour, eight more planes were added. It was not until 4:30 p.m. that the enemy planes flew back to the north. Judging from their flight route, it must have been from an aircraft carrier outside the port, and there was no enemy airport base in that area. However, the writer later confirmed from all sides that although the enemy came to bomb in formation this time, our losses were extremely minimal, because the enemy planes flew too high when dropping bombs, so it was quite difficult to hit.

Considerable Losses in Pudong and Other Places

At 11:30 a.m. yesterday morning, seven enemy planes appeared in the sky over the Huangpu River. After circling and scouting our Pudong position, they began to drop bombs to threaten us. Although the bombs rained down, our army was not moved and responded calmly. After our army bombarded them with anti-aircraft guns for an hour, the enemy planes fled in panic. Most of the bombs dropped by the enemy planes fell in the area north of Dongchang Road, including Lan Nidu, Lujiazui, and Hongsheng Wharf, causing heavy losses. (Another report) In order to salvage the situation, the enemy army obtained assistance from newly arrived units and was arranging a new position, fearing our army's attack. Therefore, at 4 p.m. yesterday, they sent multiple land-based bombers, divided into three teams, flying from outside the Huangpu River. First, they circled back and forth in the Zhabei Yinxiang area, and then scattered and flew in all directions to bomb, dropping many bombs. For a time, there were loud noises like thunder, and black smoke soared into the sky. Then, in the northeast, a fire suddenly started, and the flames were extremely fierce. At that time, the east wind was strong, so the fire spread westward. It took about twenty minutes for the fire to begin to extinguish.

One Enemy Plane Hit and Burned

At about 4 p.m. yesterday afternoon, a large number of Japanese planes were discovered in Zhabei, about twenty or more, flying high in the sky, dropping about fifty bombs in various places, but most of them did not explode, so we did not suffer major losses. At about 10 a.m., there were also three enemy planes, which first turned from Shanghai to Zhabei. Our defending troops noticed them and immediately bombarded them with anti-aircraft guns. One plane was hit on its side, and a piece of steel plate the size of a tile, about four or five points thick and weighing four or five pounds, was shot down and fell at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Meibaige Road in the Public Concession, in front of the Dashun Gong Southern Goods Store. At that time, there were two Indian constables nearby, which was quite dangerous. Later, the store picked it up. It was discovered that the steel plate was shot down from the plane's engine, and one end had spiral patterns, so it was known that it must have been seriously injured. Currently, the above steel plate has been collected by the store. (Another report) At about 4 p.m. yesterday afternoon, eight enemy planes flew in formation to scout our army's positions in the Zhabei Hongkou area and dropped bombs, attempting to destroy our rear. Our army, waiting for the enemy planes to approach, fired anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns together, sweeping into the air. At that time, the fighting was very fierce. Among them, one twin-engine bomber was hit by our anti-aircraft machine gun. The fuselage was damaged, and it immediately fled with injuries. Unexpectedly, when flying across the river to the Qingyun Temple near the Dinghai Bridge in Yangshupu, in the direction of the Meifu Oil Depot, the plane lost its ability to steer and fell from the sky to the edge of the oil pool. With a loud noise, the entire plane was destroyed. A pilot and a Japanese soldier were killed instantly. Fortunately, the oil pool was not affected, which was fortunate. The other four enemy planes also had no intention of fighting and fled hastily. In this battle, one of our planes was damaged, and two soldiers died. The enemy dropped more than a dozen bombs, destroying several of our civilian houses, with no other losses, it is said.

### Under the Pressure of Our Artillery Fire, the Izumo Suffers Damage and Relocates

Severely Damaged in the Stern, Losing Combat Power; Now Moored at the Gonghexing Wharf for Repairs

The Izumo, the main ship of the Japanese Third Fleet stationed in Shanghai, was anchored outside the Garden Bridge, using the concession as the headquarters for issuing orders and attacking our army. In order to avoid affecting the concession and preventing the air force from fully exerting its power to destroy it, we had to take a proper strategy to severely punish the ship. At about 9 p.m. on the 16th, amidst the heavy artillery fire of both sides, we bombed the ship with a certain explosive military device, hitting the stern immediately, causing severe damage and losing combat power. The ship then quietly relocated, mooring in the river at the Gonghexing Wharf downstream. The details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, our reporter drove to the area again in the faint light of dawn to inspect. Indeed, a cruiser had been moored in place of the original spot, while the ship was moored in the river at the Gonghexing Wharf for repairs. This move can reduce the danger to the safety of the concession, but it is still necessary to see what the ship will do in the future. The detailed situation of yesterday is compiled below.

Stern Damaged and Undergoing Repairs

The Japanese flagship Izumo, anchored in front of the Japanese Mail Boat Wharf, in front of the Japanese consulate, was heavily bombarded by our side the night before. The stern was damaged, and it left the Waitany Bridge at about 5 a.m. yesterday morning and moved to the second buoy in the river several hundred meters downstream, in front of the Gonghexing Wharf. At the original wharf, at 9 a.m. yesterday morning, a transport ship from Kobe unloaded a large amount of ammunition and then left.

According to the Central News Agency, the enemy flagship Izumo, which was originally anchored north of the Waitany Bridge to command enemy forces in combat, has been damaged after being bombed several times by our bombers. On the 16th night, it was bombed with a certain explosive military device, causing several holes in the stern and suffering heavy damage. It immediately sailed away from the Japanese consulate and is now moored at the No. 2 Buoy opposite the Gonghexing Wharf for repairs. In addition, an enemy gunboat originally moored at the Yangjing Canal has also sailed to Gonghexing to moor, and a large cruiser is afraid of the Zhaoshangju Middle Warehouse, it is said.

A reporter from the Xinxin News Agency went to the edge of the Waitany Bridge yesterday morning to check. The original mooring location of the Izumo ship has been changed to a cargo ship from Osaka Company. Looking at the enemy ship Izumo at the Gonghexing Wharf from a distance, five enemy ships have been moored around it for protection. Because the ship was heavily damaged and its combat power has disappeared, it can no longer be attacked by our army, it is said.

Another report: At about 10 a.m. yesterday morning, an enemy transport ship arrived in front of the Japanese Mail Boat Wharf, with newly arrived reinforcements being unloaded. These reinforcements were selected from various divisions and mixed together, with an unknown number of people. Yesterday morning, they landed at the original anchorage of the Izumo ship.

Combat Power of the Izumo Flagship

The enemy ship Izumo is a first-class patrol ship of the third fleet commander's flagship and was built in Germany in 1900. The displacement is 9,100 tons, the ship length is 124.46 feet, the width is 58 feet, and it is equipped with four 20-centimeter heavy guns, twelve 15-centimeter guns, one anti-aircraft gun, two machine guns, two torpedoes, and a pair of reconnaissance aircraft. During the January 28 Shanghai War, the enemy ship led the fleet to invade China and was also bombed by our 19th Route Army with a certain explosive military device, but it unfortunately missed. Since then, the enemy ship has repeatedly violated our coastline. This time, it again led a team to invade China, and was injured and moved to anchorage under the attack of our planes and artillery the day before.

### The Magnificent Achievements of Our Army Attacking the Enemy's Nest in Tiantong'an

The Enemy's Nest is Solid and Surrounded by Electric Current; It is Still Under Our Close Siege

(Special Report from Our Newspaper) Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War and the enemy's successive defeats, the enemy's headquarters, the Marine Corps headquarters, at the intersection of Tiantong'an Railway Station and Jiangwan Road has become isolated. It has long been surrounded by our army, but because the distance is relatively far, our army has repeatedly attempted to seize it, but all failed. According to military sources, the night before (the 16th), the enemy army, seeing that our side was gradually approaching, made a last-ditch effort, mobilizing more than 1,000 people. Under the cover of more than 20 armored vehicles and fierce machine gun artillery fire, they attacked our position in the direction of Qingyun Road. Our army resisted bravely, fighting fiercely for a long time, but because of the enemy's fierce momentum, our army could not withstand it and temporarily retreated. Then, they regrouped their forces and, together with the garrison from the Hongkou Park area on Jiangwan Road in the north and the Deswei Road area in the east, advanced in an encirclement, counterattacking the enemy's fort with extremely fierce artillery fire. Our army advanced without retreat, bravely competing to be the first, directly approaching the enemy headquarters. After several hours of bloody battle, the enemy army could not withstand it, suffering heavy casualties, and retreated in defeat to North Sichuan Road. Our army's forward troops had approached the enemy camp, only 200 meters away. At a single order, our daredevils charged desperately, directly attacking the enemy's nest, but they suffered a setback and failed to take it in one fell swoop, which was a great pity. According to a post-war investigation, the enemy headquarters was surrounded by electric current, and the walls around it were made of steel plates and cement, like iron walls and copper walls, extremely solid. However, our army has closely surrounded it and is slowly destroying it. Even with such solid defenses, it should not be difficult to take it down soon.

According to the Central News Agency, the night before, 1,500 enemy troops, under the cover of seven armored vehicles, attacked our Qingyun Road position and were repelled by our army. Taking advantage of the victory, our army counterattacked. By about 9 a.m. yesterday morning, our □□ Division □□□ Brigade, under the cover of heavy artillery, crossed the Qingyun Bridge on Qingyun Road, and the enemy retreated towards Baoshan Bridge. When our army attacked Qingyun Bridge, there were many thatched houses next to the bridge, and part of the enemy army used them as cover, lying in wait, firing machine guns densely at us. Many of our loyal and brave soldiers rolled into them on the ground, setting them on fire. The remaining enemies in the houses were burned to death, causing great confusion among most of the enemy army, and our army immediately charged forward, occupying the area. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties.

### The Entire Luo Regiment Sacrificed Themselves in the Battle of Nankou

Cannon fire can be heard within Beiping City. The battle on the Jinpu Railway Line is quiet.

[Nanjing] According to official sources, the battle in the Nankou area on the 14th of this month was extremely fierce. The enemy bombarded our positions with heavy artillery all day, firing approximately 5,000 rounds. At the same time, they used over thirty heavy tanks to launch a fierce assault on our positions. Our inner and outer trench defenses were destroyed. Luo Fanggui's unit, belonging to the 529th Regiment of Wang Zhonglian's division, fought bravely and staunchly, refusing to retreat, resulting in the entire regiment's sacrifice. Not a single person, including the regimental commander, survived. Their heroic sacrifice is unprecedented in modern warfare, surpassing even the spirit of the Japanese "human bullets" in the Russo-Japanese War. Later, reinforcements were dispatched by our side, and the enemy was defeated. The enemy's casualties were even greater than ours. This spirit of resistance is not only the most glorious in our nation's history but also a model for all soldiers in the country. It further strengthens the belief that the final victory in this war will belong to us. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)

[Baoding] Reliable information indicates that on the 16th, there were approximately one thousand enemy troops in the Langfang area, approximately three thousand in Huangcun, and approximately five hundred in Anci County.

### Qingdao Japanese Sailor Incident Not Negotiated Yesterday

[Qingdao] Negotiations between China and Japan regarding the Japanese sailor incident were not held on the 16th. The date for negotiations has not been set.

Commentary

### A Respectful Message to Compatriots in the Rear

—Qi

Our country has been pushed to the brink step by step by the aggressors. It has no choice but to rise up and wage a sacred national war of self-defense. The prelude to a full-scale war has already begun. The rise and fall, the survival and extinction of our nation are at stake. The central government is anxious above, and the warriors are fighting hard at the front. The hopes of the people for the government for many years have been realized at once. What should we, the people in the rear, do with great determination and make a final effort? I respectfully offer a few suggestions to my dear compatriots.

There is a nation, then there is a people. All the property and interests of the people should be subject to the government's control at this critical juncture. Not only should the purchase of foreign exchange and the flight of capital be absolutely and automatically stopped, but bank deposits, except for living expenses and necessary purposes, should not be withdrawn too much, but temporarily used for government military purposes. Otherwise, if the country is lost, the assets will also belong to the enemy. Our people should be acutely aware of this.

Frontline operations must have well-fed soldiers and horses in order to fight the enemy bravely. All of our compatriots should enthusiastically donate money and materials, and donating taxes is the best way to go. Let the military authorities take control. Next are food, medicine, and winter clothing. As for unnecessary rewards, they do not seem essential and can be stopped to save expenses.

The food supply for the people in the rear must also be fully replenished. Although transportation has been suspended, there are still railways that can be used. We must find ways to replenish food supplies from all sources to avoid panic. On the one hand, the hoarding and price gouging of the rice industry should be strictly prohibited. On the other hand, we should also try our best to dredge the sources of oil, salt, vegetables, fuel, etc., to stabilize the people's hearts.

The situation of the poor and distressed refugees is truly pitiful and can be worrying for local security. Although there are already charitable organizations setting up shelters, that is the best. On the one hand, provide temporary relief, and on the other hand, gradually send them back to their hometowns. This will not only reduce the local food supply, but also benefit the security of the rear.

Air warfare is our country's first test in foreign wars. Our compatriots, driven by patriotism, applaud and cheer, and shout slogans, which is not reprehensible. However, air combat is very dangerous. All of our compatriots, when encountering air combat, should not go out unless necessary. Passing pedestrians can temporarily take refuge in nearby houses to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. Let us keep these useful bodies to prepare for the final battle against the enemy.

The government is determined and preparing for a long-term war, hoping to win the final victory. The loss or gain of one place is irrelevant to the overall situation. We need not rejoice wildly at the news of victory, nor need we be discouraged by the news of defeat. All hearsay rumors and false reports from wireless stations can be ignored. Finally, I especially hope that the press will find ways to verify the information they obtain and provide faithful reports. Otherwise, it is better to have no reports than to have false ones. I hope my colleagues will encourage each other.

### British Newspapers Filled with Reports of the Shanghai War

Calling Chiang Kai-shek "Cromwell" - British Mediation Unlikely to Succeed

[London] British newspapers' news columns, art and literature columns, broadcast reports, and movie newsreels are all related to the Shanghai incident, indicating that people throughout the United Kingdom are deeply concerned about the Shanghai war and its related issues. British political and opinion circles are regretting that Japan has not made sincere efforts to prevent the deterioration of the situation and do not believe Japan's claim of self-defense, as Japanese troops are currently fighting in Chinese territory. Many believe that Tokyo may not be willing to accept British mediation, so the possibility of British mediation is currently unrealizable. The Daily Express stated that Japan's invasion of China is almost identical to Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia. The newspaper also praised Chairman Chiang as a modern Cromwell and said that if the two major trends of nationalism and revolution unite into a great force, China will one day drive out the invaders, as France did in 1793 and Russia did in 1920. The Daily Telegraph stated that the British government is facilitating the evacuation of British women and children from Shanghai. As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, this is the only possible way to prevent the desperate fighting in the area from causing disputes in international relations. As far as the current situation is concerned, both China and Japan are unwilling to cease fire, and there is no hope that the Concession will not suffer further tragedies. The Morning Post stated that many British friends of Japan, regardless of whether the aims that Japan claims to have are sincere, cannot help but say that the means Japan has taken to achieve these aims are unwise. Others cannot judge when Japan's patience has run out, but is the sudden dispatch of a large fleet the most appropriate remedy for the killing of two sailors? (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 17th)

[London] Many newspapers commented on the war between China and Japan. The Liberal Party's News Chronicle stated, "If Japan had not invaded Chinese territory by force, China would not have needed to defend itself with bombers. Therefore, the countries concerned should protest to Japan about the fact that Chinese aircraft bombs accidentally landed in the Shanghai Concession, and not to China." The Liberal Party's Manchester Guardian stated, "There is no doubt that Japan has begun a large-scale war. Many people believe that the scope of this war is so large that it could bankrupt Japan. It would be futile to mediate at this time." The Conservative Party's Daily Telegraph stated, "The British government is advising its women and children to evacuate from Shanghai and is facilitating this. This is the only action that can be taken at present to reduce the crisis faced by the expatriates." The Conservative Party's Morning Post stated, "All countries concerned, large and small, cannot be indifferent to the war in Shanghai. If China intends to lodge a complaint with the League of Nations, then based on the experience of the past five years, it will only make the situation more confusing, and it should not be encouraged."

### The Municipal Government Allocated 60,000 Yuan to Rescue and Repatriate Refugees

Raising Vehicles and Ships to Send in Batches, Refugees are Dispersed to Reduce the Burden of Food

The Shanghai Relief Committee, which was organized by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau in conjunction with local associations and various charitable organizations and hometown associations, has established more than 90 shelters. In addition to refugees being sent to other places one after another, there are now more than 40,000 people in the shelters, and a large amount of food is needed for daily supplies. Rescue and repatriation also require cars and gasoline, and all kind people are expected to donate generously. The municipal government, in view of the fact that rescuing refugees is an urgent task at present, has decided to allocate 60,000 yuan to instruct the Social Affairs Bureau to subsidize the Relief Committee's expenses, and has allocated another 40,000 yuan for the expenses of rescuing wounded soldiers. It has also telegraphed relevant authorities to raise vehicles and ships to send them in batches, and at the same time requested that counties in the interior of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces set up shelters to disperse the refugees in Shanghai and reduce the burden of food in Shanghai.

### British and American Women and Children Temporarily Leave Shanghai

The Dollar Steamship Lines will begin selling tickets for the President Jefferson and President McKinley on the 16th and 17th specifically for the evacuation of American expatriate wives and children. Initially, the two ships originally planned to go directly to Hong Kong, but they received a telegram from Hong Kong informing them that the hotels in Hong Kong were fully booked and could not accommodate such a large number of Americans. Therefore, it was decided to send the batch of women and children to Luzon. At 10 am yesterday, the first batch of more than 350 people boarded the President Jefferson to the Philippines, and there were also more than 100 people in third class. The first batch also had more than 500 people, who are scheduled to be transported to Luzon by the President McKinley at 10 am today. There will be a third batch on the 20th, and it is reported that there will be more than 600 people traveling on the President Hoover.

### The Western Prison and Police Station Were Hit by Artillery Shells

Many Prisoners Were Killed and Injured

There are about 15,000 prisoners in the Western Prison on Ward Road. Although it is close to the front line, the prison cannot be moved, so it is still being held. The Huishan Police Station was also not evacuated because of this. At 8:30 yesterday morning, a part of the prison was suddenly hit by artillery shells, and at the same time, the Public Works Department Police Station on Baoding Road and the surrounding area of the Huishan Police Station were also hit by shells.

### Shanghai-Hangzhou Train Opened Five Passenger Trains Yesterday

Eight or Nine People Were Killed by Bridges, Listen to Instructions and Do Not Rush

Large truck traffic between Shanghai and Hangzhou still operated normally yesterday. Yesterday, the South Station opened a total of five passenger trains at 8:00 am, 10:10 am, 12:00 pm, 4:00 pm, and 6:20 pm. However, due to the large number of people, although the road staff tried to add carriages to each passenger train, it was still not enough to carry them. When the train was about to leave, some people climbed onto the roof of the car, causing one passenger train to be hit in the head by the bridge when it was halfway to Songjiang Zhongtu No. 31 Bridge, and eight or nine people who were hit and fell into the water and were tragically killed, and many people were injured. They were all rescued. Therefore, our refugee people must know that the authorities will do their utmost to maintain it, but they must strictly observe the order, listen to the guidance of the road station staff, and do not rush or panic. The result of rushing and panicking is enough to cause trampling, death and injury, and hinder traffic work.
