### Stubborn Enemy Attempts River Crossing Again at Chenjiadu and Houjiadai, Fierce Fighting All Day

After our army's encirclement and fierce suppression, the enemy's momentum has been greatly weakened. The enemy fiercely attacks Xiaonanxiang, seeking a foothold to no avail. Our defense line at Shixianggong Temple remains unchanged, with no westward shift.

From the early hours of the previous day, the enemy repeatedly attempted to cross the Suzhou River along the northern bank from the Fanhuang Railway Bridge west to Shenjibin (i.e., Yaojiadu), but was repelled by our army each time. However, at Beixinjing and Zhoujiaqiao, under the cover of their artillery and smoke screens, they managed to force their way across the river. After being encircled and fiercely attacked by our army, they were completely eliminated. Around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy again attempted to cross the river stealthily near the Zhongshan Road Bridge, with about twenty enemy soldiers even reaching the vicinity of our positions near the farmland and cotton mill. They were quickly routed by our army's repeated assaults. At 11:00 AM, the enemy again attempted to cross the river stealthily at Chenjiadu and Houjiadai, attacking our positions at Liujiazhai and Wujiaku. About a hundred enemy soldiers crossed from Chenjiadu, and after being encircled and attacked by our army, many were killed. A few remnants are still struggling. About three hundred enemy soldiers crossed at Houjiadai and were tightly surrounded by our army. As of 3:00 AM this morning (the 2nd), the fighting has intensified. The enemy is on the verge of collapse and should be completely eliminated shortly. As for the central front from Jiangqiao to Xiaonanxiang, at 2:00 PM yesterday, the enemy again concentrated their land and air forces to launch a fierce attack on our positions at Xiaonanxiang, Tangqiaojiao, and other locations. However, our positions are exceptionally well-fortified and suffered no damage. The fighting continued fiercely into the evening. On the left flank, the defense line at Shixianggong Temple has maintained close contact since our new defensive line was completed. Although the enemy has attacked several times, our line has remained unchanged and has not shifted westward.

### Enemy Again Crosses River to Attack Southward Yesterday

Fierce Fighting All Day, We Are Encircling to Resolve the Situation

Since the focus of the Shanghai battle shifted to western Shanghai, artillery fire has been incessant on both sides of the Suzhou River for the past three days. The enemy attempted to cross the river and attack at Zhoujiaqiao, Chenjiadu, and other places the day before yesterday, and after we inflicted heavy losses on them, they again attempted to cross stealthily at Chenjiadu and Houjiadai at 11:00 AM yesterday, resulting in fierce fighting all day. According to a report from a Central News Agency correspondent accompanying the troops at 11:30 PM last night, the enemy's momentum had been checked by evening, and our army is encircling them to resolve the situation. The battle situation is as follows:

### Hundred Enemy Soldiers at Chenjiadu Fiercely Attacked

From early yesterday morning, the enemy army launched heavy artillery bombardment on our South bank positions. Enemy aircraft were also unusually active, but didn't drop many bombs. In the Chenjiadu area, the enemy constructed a pontoon bridge. While our army was attempting to destroy it, the enemy again released smoke screens at 11:00 AM and crossed the bridge, but numbering only about a hundred men. Our army launched an attack from Liujiazhai, killing many enemies. By nightfall, a small number of remnants retreated to the North bank, struggling, and will soon be eliminated.

### Three Hundred at Houjiadai Surrounded

At the same time, in the Houjiadai area, about two kilometers northwest of Beixinjing, the enemy also attempted to cross the river under the cover of smoke screens and began building a bridge. The method was very simple: one end of a canvas was tied to the North bank, and a motorboat dragged it to the opposite bank and tied it down, completing the bridge. About three hundred enemy soldiers crossed there and advanced towards our Qujiaqiao and Yaojiazhai along the entire line. After our brave fighting, we pushed the enemy back westward. The enemy concentrated their forces to fiercely attack our two strongholds at Wujiaku and Tingtou, which they occupied. Our army then counterattacked and, at around 6:00 PM, drove out the enemy from Tingtou and encircled and attacked the enemy at Wujiaku, aiming to eliminate them within a limited time.

### Enemy Completely Eliminated the Day Before Yesterday

It has also been learned that of the three hundred enemy soldiers who crossed the river at Zhoujiaqiao the day before yesterday, only about a hundred managed to reach the South bank after being shelled by our artillery in mid-river. There are many civilian houses in that area, and the enemy scattered and hid in them, making it difficult to suppress them. Therefore, we used fire to set ablaze all the houses occupied by the enemy. The remaining twenty or thirty soldiers fled towards the riverbank and hid along the shore. Our machine-gun fire was ineffective, so we sent a suicide squad to crawl to the shore and throw hand grenades, annihilating them. Our inspection of the enemy corpses revealed that they belonged to the 6th Regiment of the 3rd Division of the Army.

According to another report, on the right wing, from the early hours of the previous day to dawn yesterday, the enemy launched continuous southward attacks along the line from the Fanhuang Railway Bridge west to Shenjibin (i.e., Yaojiadu) on the Suzhou River for 24 hours. Our army relied on solid defenses on the South bank, and the enemy's repeated attempts to cross the river were all repelled. However, at Beixinjing and Zhoujiaqiao, under the cover of their artillery and smoke screens, they managed to force their way across the river, but in small numbers. Last night, after being encircled and fiercely attacked by our army, they were completely eliminated. There are no enemy traces on the South bank. It is estimated that 50-60 rifles were captured at Beixinjing and 20-30 at Zhoujiaqiao. Few survived, and the rest fell into the river and died. At around 3:00 AM this morning, the enemy, unwilling to accept their complete failure at the two locations mentioned above, transferred about a company of infantry and attempted to cross the river stealthily near the Zhongshan Road Bridge. They were immediately suppressed by our army's machine-gun fire. However, a small number of enemy soldiers, about twenty, managed to reach our positions near the farmland and cotton mill. After our army's repeated assaults, they quickly collapsed due to their unstable foothold. We captured over ten rifles. After dawn, the enemy only shelled with artillery. Our army responded calmly and remained unshaken. As of noon, both sides are in a standoff across the river.

### Enemy Army Fiercely Attacks Xiaonanxiang

Stalemate Until Evening, Our Positions Remain Unchanged

A Central News Agency correspondent accompanying the troops in Nanxiang reported at 12:00 AM on the 1st that the enemy's plan to attack Nanxiang westward has not been abandoned, and our army is also making thorough preparations. At 2:00 PM today, after days of preparation, the enemy indeed launched a fierce attack with over 6,000 infantry, supported by combined land and air artillery fire, attacking Xiaonanxiang head-on and advancing on our Tangqiaojiao and Tuditang flanks. The front line stretched for two kilometers. Our army's positions, which had been repaired for two days, are exceptionally well-fortified and remained intact despite the enemy's concentrated artillery fire. Therefore, the stalemate continued until evening, and our positions remained unchanged. The enemy was eager to advance and rushed forward, while we countered, leading to fierce fighting. It is expected that there will be more intense main force battles tomorrow.

### Our Army's Position at Shixianggong Temple Has Not Shifted Westward

A Central News Agency correspondent accompanying the troops in Guangfu had an interview with a senior staff officer in charge of commanding the left-wing army. He solemnly stated that his army, after several fierce battles with the enemy in Luodian from August 23rd to September 7th, only moved its positions slightly backward on September 8th and remained in a standoff with the enemy near the eastern side of Shixianggong Temple until now. Although the enemy has attacked repeatedly, our positions have not changed at all. Although the right-wing positions to the north have undergone new deployments, they have maintained close contact with the left wing at all times, so there is no impact. The previous report that the Shixianggong Temple position had shifted westward is inaccurate.

### Enemy's Westward Attack from Zhenru Failed

We Repelled the Attack, Killing Over 400 Enemy Soldiers and Capturing Three Field Guns and Fifteen Machine Guns

A Central News Agency correspondent accompanying the troops reported at 11:00 AM on the 1st that at 11:00 PM last night, two enemy regiments advanced westward from Zhenru along the Dianpu and Chapu Rivers, attacking our warning positions at Qianlijiaxiang and Jisian'an in front of Jiangqiao Town. We dispatched two units to counterattack, launching repeated assaults five or six times, and drove the enemy back this morning. In this battle, we killed over 400 enemy soldiers and captured three field guns and fifteen machine guns.

### Over Three Thousand Enemy Reinforcements Arrive

Also, One Torpedo Boat and Eight Hundred Wounded Soldiers Set Sail Back to Their Country

At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, three enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships, the "Tsuguba Maru," the "Kotoku Maru," and Transport Ship No. 198 "Ume Maru," successively sailed into Shanghai and docked at the Huangpu Wharf, the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf, and the Osaka Wharf. At around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, Enemy Transport Ship No. 43 "Kuzo Maru" also arrived and docked at the Osaka Wharf. These four ships carried the sixth batch of the enemy's sixth reinforcement army, totaling over three thousand men. In addition, yesterday, three more enemy transport ships, the "Iro" Nojima and Merchant Ship converted to Transport Ship No. 135, sailed into Shanghai and docked at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf and the Zhabei Wharf, carrying a large amount of military supplies. Among the ships listed above, the "Ume Maru" and "Iro," left Shanghai and returned to Japan at around 4:00 PM yesterday. The remaining ships are still anchored in the Huangpu River.

According to the Central News Agency, a confirmed report states that there were originally two enemy torpedo boats anchored in the Huangpu River, one named "Okinosbima," anchored at the Zhabei Wharf, and one named "Iyskushima," anchored at Buoy No. 9. At around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, another enemy torpedo boat with an unknown name sailed into Shanghai and anchored at Buoy No. 8. All three ships are fully loaded with torpedoes. The purpose of their arrival is unknown. In addition, two enemy transport ships sailed into Shanghai at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning and docked at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf and the Zhabei Wharf, carrying countless artillery shells, rifle bullets, and other military supplies.

The enemy transport ship "Shanghai Maru," which carried military supplies the day before yesterday, unloaded the supplies after docking at the Huishan Wharf. Yesterday, it reloaded over eight hundred wounded enemy soldiers and set sail back to Japan at around 3:00 PM in the afternoon.

### Representatives of Various Groups Visit Foreign Envoys to Request Protection of the Nine-Power Treaty

Envoys Express Sympathy and Willingness to Relay Message. Telegram to Chairman of the Belgian Conference Requesting Sanctions Against Japan's Brutality. Request to European Students to Petition the Belgian Conference.

The Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association previously convened a joint meeting of various groups and resolved many important cases, including issuing a declaration and telegrams regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, expressing its position, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has been learned that the meeting yesterday also dispatched representatives to visit foreign envoys in Shanghai, telegraphed the chairman of the conference in Belgium and the delegations of various countries, and telegraphed students studying in Europe to petition nearby. The details of the various situations are listed below:

### Visits to Foreign Envoys

The association's delegation, consisting of Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Xinzhi, Tong Xingbai, Liu Zhanen, Xu Xinliu, Yan Fuqing, Zhu Shaoping, and nine others, gathered at the Central Trust Bank at 9:00 AM yesterday, carrying two printed documents and a declaration, and set off to visit the consulates of various countries in Shanghai, meeting with the ambassadors and consuls representing their countries in Shanghai. On behalf of the Chinese people, they expressed their solemn position on the Nine-Power Treaty, requesting the envoys to relay the message to their respective governments and advocate for a fair position based on the spirit of the treaty. The envoys all expressed sympathy and willingness to relay the message to their governments. The atmosphere was very harmonious.

### Telegram to the Belgian Conference

The meeting believes that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will convene in three days. Yesterday, it sent an urgent telegram to the Chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Belgium and the delegations of various countries, stating: "The Chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and the delegations of various countries of the Chinese Parliament in Beijing, it is known that since September 18th, Japanese warlords have brazenly and openly invaded our country's territory, arbitrarily damaged the integrity of our country's administration, seized our Northeast, attacked our Hebei and Chahar, looted our customs, and infringed upon our postal rights. All of the spirit and provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty have been broken without remaining. The Chinese government, in order to fulfill its treaty obligations and defend its territory, has had no choice but to fight to the death with an indomitable spirit to curb violence. Now, at the time of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the agricultural, commercial, industrial, and educational groups in Shanghai specially convened a joint meeting and jointly telegraphed your chairman and your delegations, earnestly requesting that, in order to maintain the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty, you implement: (1) clearly declare Japan as a violator of the treaty, (2) order the Japanese army to withdraw completely and quickly, (3) if Japan does not comply with the resolution, then please use the most effective sanctions to stop the Japanese atrocities, (4) actively assist China in resisting the war, and (5) in order to avoid future disputes, strengthen the Nine-Power Treaty and add sanction clauses, so that the collective security of the Pacific Ocean can be maintained and world peace can also be maintained."

### Telegram to Students Studying in Europe

The association also telegraphed the Chinese student associations in England, France, Germany, and Belgium yesterday, stating: "The Japanese brutality is escalating, trampling on international treaties, destroying world peace, and is a scourge to humanity and a demon to the East. As long as we have breath, we will fight them to the end. Now that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is being held in Belgium, please gather nearby and petition the conference, and make sure to base your requests on the spirit of the treaty and impose effective sanctions on Japan to curb its atrocities. We are anxiously awaiting your response. The Joint Meeting of Various Groups in Shanghai."

### Summary of Telegrams from Various Groups

(1) The Chinese Labor Association, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, and the Chinese Seamen's Union telegraphed the general trade unions in England, the United States, France, Russia, Norway, Brazil, Mexico, India, New Zealand, Sydney, Marseille, Canada, South Africa, Vancouver, and other places, stating: "The Japanese are launching a large-scale invasion of China, arbitrarily bombing and massacring innocent people, burning cultural institutions, and killing young students, creating an unprecedented tragedy. This not only endangers world peace but also destroys human culture. Our association and others specially telegraphed your association, earnestly requesting you to immediately implement various effective sanctions to prevent aggression and maintain peace. We would be extremely grateful." (2) The China General Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, local associations, the Shanghai Banking Association, and the Money Industry Association telegraphed the general chambers of commerce and commercial groups in various countries, stating the Japanese atrocities and requesting them to unanimously advocate for sanctions against Japan. (3) The Chinese Cultural Construction Association, the Shanghai Education Association, the Shanghai University Federation, the Middle School Federation, the Primary School Federation, and other groups also separately telegraphed important cultural groups in Europe and the United States, requesting sanctions against the Japanese atrocities. The text of the telegram is omitted.

### Enemy Aircraft Rampage in Pudong

At around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, six enemy aircraft, divided into two teams, circled and scouted over the areas of Lujia Du, Yangjia Ji, and Zhangjia Bang in Pudong, taking turns dropping over ten bombs, destroying over ten civilian houses. The enemy aircraft only left at around 5:00 PM. At the same time, an enemy aircraft flew low over the No. 16 Wharf in the South City and the Lannidu area in Pudong, strafing with machine guns. Fortunately, the residents of the area had already taken shelter in safe areas, and there were no casualties.

### Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Kunshan

Intact Aircraft Body, Five Pilots Captured, Two Others Fled and Are Being Searched For

On the morning of the 30th, several enemy heavy bombers flew to Kunshan to bomb. As reported in the previous newspaper, one was shot down by our anti-aircraft guns. According to further reports, the downed enemy aircraft has an intact body. Two machine guns, one radio, and five pilots were captured. The other two fled and are currently being searched for.

### Commander Xie Jinyuan of the Lone Army Regiment Meets with Chinese and Foreign Reporters

Discusses Withdrawal from Zhabei. Bitterly Defended for Four Days and Nights, Killing Over a Hundred Enemy Soldiers. Rich Experience in Over Ten Years of Participation in Campaigns.

After Xie Jinyuan, commander of the 524th Regiment of the 262nd Brigade of our 88th Division, withdrew from the last position in Zhabei under orders from the highest authorities, the regiment, excluding Battalion Commander Yang Ruifu and the wounded soldiers who have been admitted to the hospital for treatment, has arrived at a safe area and will soon return to the front line to continue killing the enemy. The Shen Shi News reporter visited Commander Xie at a certain location yesterday. At that time, Reuters reporter, French Daily reporter, and North China Daily News reporter were also visiting. The record of Commander Xie's conversation with the reporters is as follows:

Japanese Rumors Are Absolutely Untrue

Foreign reporters first inquired about the Japanese propaganda stating that over a hundred Chinese soldier corpses were found in the godown after the Japanese soldiers entered the godown after the withdrawal of our lone army from the godown in Zhabei. Commander Xie replied, "The enemy's propaganda is completely untrue. In the godown, apart from a few sandbags, there were no so many corpses. There were a total of four hundred and twenty soldiers in the godown. At the time of the withdrawal, there were three hundred and seventy-seven people. Among them, more than ten were martyred, and the rest were wounded and admitted to the hospital for treatment. However, the enemy killed by our lone army was indeed more than a hundred. Because the enemy did not know how many officers and soldiers we had, they believed the Japanese rumors. The rumors are absolutely untrue."

Three Machine Guns Covered the Withdrawal

Regarding the withdrawal, Xie said that he received the order at 9:00 PM on the 30th. At that time, he immediately ordered everyone to prepare to kill the enemy but did not tell them about the withdrawal. At that time, all the officers and soldiers were determined to coexist and die with this final position. At that time, the enemy was in front, and the sound of machine guns was very close. After 1:00 AM, it slowed down slightly. The regiment took this opportunity to rush out, using three machine guns to cover the withdrawal. The enemy never dared to approach. Our safety shows how weak the enemy soldiers are. If the enemy dared to approach and attack us normally, we would not have been able to leave so safely.

Rest Briefly and Return to the Front Line

Finally, Xie said that all the officers and soldiers were extremely excited about resisting the enemy and decided to continue to the front line to kill the enemy after a brief rest. Xie is from Guangdong Province, 33 years old, and his family is currently in Guangdong. He has two sons and two daughters. Xie graduated from the fifth class of the Whampoa Military Academy and joined the Northern Expeditionary Army after graduation. He has participated in various campaigns for more than ten years and has extensive experience in combat.

### Brief Biographies of Three Generals Who Died in the Guangfu-Chenjiahang Area

In late August, there was an unprecedented fierce battle between the enemy and us in the Guangfu and Chenjiahang areas. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Our Brigade Commander Qin Lin, Brigade Commander Pang Hanzhen, and Regimental Commander Xie Dingxin all died in action. The brief biographies of the three generals are attached below to express our condolences and commemorate them.

Qin Lin, courtesy name Peiran, was from Guilin, Guangxi. He graduated from the third class of the senior course of the First Branch of the Central Military Academy. He participated in various battles of the Northern Expedition. He was loyal, resolute, and brave. He died in the Wanzhai battle at the young age of thirty-six. He was a promising young soldier of modern times. When the bad news came, the entire army wept.

Pang Hanzhen, courtesy name Yingzhong, was from Jingxi, Guangxi. He was thirty-eight years old and graduated from the second class of the senior course of the First Branch of the Central Military Academy. During the Northern Expedition, he served as a battalion commander and other positions. He was calm, upright, brave, and promising. He also died in the Tanjiatou battle.

Xie Dingxin was from Rongxian, Guangxi. He served as a brigade commander and other positions in the 19th Route Army. He also participated in the January 28th Shanghai War of Resistance. He was brave and good at fighting. In the Chenjiahang battle, he led his troops in a bloody assault, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. However, Regimental Commander Xie also died in action.

### Miscellaneous Writings from the War Zone (II)

— Geng Ya

No one will forget, right? The heroic 19th Route Army in the January 28th War of Resistance fought bitterly for one month and two days, earning high praise from the world. Just as their reputation was soaring, suddenly, like a bolt from the blue, they retreated to the second line of defense. Needless to say, this was due to the enemy's stealthy landing at Liuhe.

In contrast, in the Shanghai War of Resistance launched on August 13th, the enemy used the most superior forces, pressing us from the sea, land, and air, and employing all means of cruelty and madness. For eighty days, they paid a heavy price before making some progress on the central front. The Liuhe garrison's defensive line was as solid as gold, causing the enemy's repeated attempts to copy the old tactics of the January 28th incident to fail. This must be said to be a great contribution of the Liuhe garrison.

Indeed, the merit of the Liuhe garrison's defense is very worthy of praise. Unfortunately, that place is relatively remote and difficult to access, and few people go to visit. At the same time, Mr. XXX, who is responsible for and in charge of that area, is a descendant of a military family and is also skilled in poetry and prose. He always aims for the eight characters of "seeing rights clearly and seeing life and death clearly." He is especially able to bury himself in hard work and does not seek fame. Therefore, very few systematic articles have been published about the glorious war of resistance in Liuhe.

Before the full-scale war of resistance broke out, the reporter visited Mr. X in a certain place and talked about national defense issues. He believed that both material and spiritual aspects are extremely important. Sometimes, material construction may be destroyed by the enemy, so we must train the people and organize the spiritual national defense of the people, making more efforts. But this is by no means something that can be achieved with a single slogan. Slogans are like prescriptions, and if they are not carefully examined by a good doctor, or if they are examined but not actually taken, they will be of no use. These words are not aimed at nothing. The fact that the current strength of the people cannot be coordinated with the military strength is precisely due to this drawback. However, the people's power, which is extremely rich in reserve, is after all the greatest cornerstone supporting a protracted war of resistance. Even if it is digging a well only when thirsty, we should also develop and use it as soon as possible.

The enemy once landed at Shakou and was bravely repelled by our army. Both sides suffered five or six hundred casualties. In recent times, although the enemy has also attacked from time to time, our defensive positions are as solid as gold, and the soldiers' combat experience is becoming richer and more vigorous as they fight. There are even two divisions who do not want to change defenses and rest, so that the enemy is severely wounded and collapses every time they attack. In total, in the past two days, the number of enemy officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers killed has been confirmed to be more than two thousand (excluding those who jumped into the water and died). The enemy's Taiwan garrison's Shigetō detachment has been completely wiped out, with no survivors.

However, because of repeated failures, the enemy dared to release poison gas when attempting to land on the 11th of this month. Fortunately, the wind was very strong that night, and it did not work. Later, when cleaning the positions by the river, we found a box of poison gas bombs sent by the enemy. Apart from those that had already been released, there was only one left. The brutality of the enemy in disregarding international law is indeed a sign of their own destruction!

The enemy also has the crazy theory of a so-called five-year plan that can mobilize eight million people, but according to the observation of one of our military experts, even if all the able-bodied men in their country are completely driven to the battlefield, they will never be able to reach this huge number. Moreover, after this battle (in the Zhejiang-Shanghai area, in more than two months of fighting, their casualties have exceeded 60,000, and North China is likely to be even more severe), it is difficult to mobilize even one million people, no matter how hard they try. As for the number of people in our country, it will inevitably increase more and more, and at least ten million or more can be mobilized. The comparison of population and able-bodied men is also an important part of the modern assessment of military strength. We are superior to them, and the final victory will naturally belong to us!

### Enemy Troops Forcibly Demanding Goods with Worthless Currency

This newspaper, the "North China Daily News," reported that inside the pockets of dead Japanese soldiers on the Shanghai-Songhu battlefields, remarkably noteworthy paper money was frequently discovered. Some of this paper money belonged to China, some to Germany, and occasionally even to the Soviet Union in the form of rubles. None of it was currently accepted on the market. For example, among the Chinese paper money was that issued by the China Colonization Bank, which had ceased operations in 1916 during Yuan Shikai's era. Similarly, the various types of German currency were worth next to nothing after the Great War, and today are even more valueless. The intention behind this practice by the Japanese side has sparked widespread speculation. We cannot help but recall that the Japanese military spokesperson in Shanghai recently stated that Japanese troops would exchange goods for fair prices in occupied areas. Therefore, some believe that the paper money found in the pockets of dead Japanese soldiers was distributed by the Japanese authorities to enable the soldiers to obtain goods using worthless currency. This conjecture has considerable merit. However, Chinese people are well aware that this is the type of paper money previously issued by warlords in various provinces, and it will be difficult to deceive the average Chinese farmer. This action by the Japanese side is merely a clumsy and farcical stunt. What is even more ridiculous is that the five-yuan notes of the Colonization Bank carried by the Japanese soldiers bore the words "Zhejiang," when in fact, upon closer inspection, the original wording was "Harbin Three." (Translator's note: The "North China Daily News" also printed a copperplate engraving of the China Colonization Bank notes and German mark notes retrieved from the bodies of enemy soldiers.) This is not surprising, as the head office of the former Colonization Bank was originally located in Shenyang. After its currency became unacceptable on the market, it was stored in the provincial treasury. Furthermore, Chinese farmers can also recognize wartime German mark notes as worthless. According to news from North China, the Japanese troops there are also employing the same trick.

### Open Letter from the Taiwan Revolutionary Grand Alliance to Compatriots in Southern China and Taiwan

Defend the ancestral homeland of Southern China! Defend Jinmen and Xiamen, the gateways of Southern China!

The Japanese imperialists' plot to invade and occupy Southern China did not begin today. They have been actively and continuously advancing their armed occupation, especially in our hometowns, the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong. Since the "August 13th" incident in Shanghai, when the all-out war of resistance began, the bayonets of our national heroes on the front lines have pierced through the paper tiger of the "Imperial Army," giving the Japanese imperialists a resolute and forceful response. This has driven the savage and brutal Eastern bandits to become even more frenzied and violent, using airplanes to bomb important cities throughout China, such as Guangzhou, Xiamen, and Hainan Island, all of which have become targets for their bestial acts. Ultimately, they have even occupied these places, which is entirely in line with the malicious scheme we had foreseen. Recently, will the upcoming meeting of the signatory nations of the Nine-Power Treaty provide us with a favorable future for our war of resistance? Many countries have stated that the primary task of this meeting is to resolve the Sino-Japanese War. On one hand, our enemy is actively brewing the organization of a Mongolian puppet government. On the other, they are intensifying their military offensives to create numerous fait accompli as favorable conditions for mediation. Moreover, the enemy's internal collaborators, the traitors and collaborators, are also doing their utmost to lead China's great war of resistance down the path of accepting mediation. Therefore, after our troops withdrew from the Dayang defense line and strictly guarded the new positions on the 26th of this month, the Japanese imperialists immediately launched a naval offensive against Southern China. According to a special dispatch from Xiamen on the 27th, "Enemy warships fired more than a hundred shells, covering the landing of marines on Kinmen Island."

Furthermore, a special dispatch from Xiamen on the 28th stated, "When the enemy marines landed on Kinmen, they encountered fierce resistance from our righteous volunteers. Therefore, after occupying the island, they went into the countryside under the guidance of Taiwanese people who were previously in Jinmen, searching for military equipment and food supplies, conducting strict household registration checks, rounding up able-bodied men, and gathering them in one place for a brutal massacre using machine guns."

We are not surprised by these facts. We are only filled with extreme hatred for the fact that "after the Japanese pirates landed, they went into the countryside under the guidance of Taiwanese people who were previously in Jinmen." The Japanese invaders destroyed our Taiwan, and our hatred is as deep as the sea, our blood debt as high as a mountain. Now, they want to destroy the ancestral homeland of our ancestors, Southern China. We, the Taiwanese compatriots scattered throughout Southern China, can only immediately and voluntarily arm ourselves, join the united front of the motherland's resistance against Japan, charge towards the Japanese bandits, defend our homeland Southern China, defend China, and strive for national freedom and liberation. Unexpectedly, there are some insane people who shamelessly and willingly act as running dogs and internal collaborators of the enemy. Haven't decades of life as subjugated people been enough? Do they want to forever be Japanese slaves, unwilling to stand up and be free people?

We know that Kinmen and Xiamen are the gateways and shields of Southern China. Once they are completely occupied by the enemy, Fujian and Guangdong will face an extremely serious crisis and be threatened with subjugation. Even more frightening is that the life of slavery will be prolonged indefinitely. The tombs and fields of our ancestors will also be turned into slaughterhouses for the Japanese invaders.

Time is extremely pressing. We must not hesitate any longer, procrastinate, or mislead ourselves. Taiwanese compatriots residing in Southern China must immediately arm themselves, shatter the enemy's conspiracies and aggression, fight to defend our ancestral homeland Southern China, and fight to defend Kinmen and Xiamen!

### Foreign Ministry Issues Statement on the Eve of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference

Refuting Japanese Slanders and Listing Atrocities of Aggression. No Peace Possible if Japan Does Not Withdraw Troops

[Nanjing] The Foreign Ministry spokesman issued the following statement regarding the Japanese government's statement of October 28 refusing to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference: The Japanese government has decided to refuse to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and formally sent a reply to the Belgian ambassador to Japan on October 27 stating its so-called reasons. On the 28th, it issued a lengthy statement elaborating on its so-called position. A review of both documents reveals that they not only contain many slanderous words against China, but also fail to understand the painstaking efforts of the League of Nations and the United States to maintain peace. The Japanese statement begins by stating that the root cause of the Sino-Japanese conflict lies in China's consistent anti-foreign policy since the Xinhai Revolution, especially its thorough anti-Japanese policy. It also states that Japan has had unlimited sympathy for the awakening of China's national consciousness and has provided various forms of assistance. However, China not only did not appreciate this great virtue but instead brandished its weapons of anti-Japanism, leading to the current situation. Therefore, the key to resolving the Sino-Japanese conflict lies in China abandoning its anti-Japanese policy and instead cooperating with Japan. This argument is easily seen as false by anyone familiar with recent events in East Asia. The foreign policy of China's National Revolution is to seek freedom and equality for China. This is the reasonable aspiration of the Chinese nation and is deeply understood and sympathized with by friends from other countries. The Chinese government has always respected the legitimate rights and interests of foreigners and welcomes foreign capital and technical talent. The current development of Sino-foreign commerce and the friendship between peoples are sufficient to serve as ironclad proof of China's good faith policies and cannot be obscured by Japanese slander. Japan is China's close neighbor and shares a similar culture. The Chinese government and people have no time to be anything but friendly; how could they possibly discriminate? Since the Xinhai Revolution, Japan has used every possible means to infringe upon and oppress China. The Twenty-One Demands are still fresh in the memory of the world. After the National Revolution, Japan obstructed the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army, undermined China's unification, and created the Jinan Incident of 1928. Is this how they express their so-called welcome for the awakening of China's national consciousness? As for Japan's claim that it was the first to assist China in restoring tariff autonomy and expressed goodwill towards China's hope of abolishing extraterritoriality, this is also inconsistent with the facts. China signed tariff treaties with relevant countries in 1928, completing tariff autonomy. Only Japan made various demands until 1930, when it finally signed a treaty with various conditions attached. In the past two years, Japan has assisted large-scale smuggling on one hand and obstructed China's anti-smuggling efforts on the other, causing significant damage to China's tariff revenue and customs administration. Regarding the issue of extraterritoriality, Japan has made the most of this privilege in recent years to cover up various illegal activities, such as free flights, private establishment of special service agencies, provision of bandits, and sale of drugs. Is this how they "adopt policies to meet China's legitimate expectations"? After the September 18th Incident, Japan forcibly occupied Chinese territory and endangered China's survival, becoming even more blatant and unscrupulous. After the puppet state of Manchukuo, it created the puppet organization of Eastern Hebei, and now it is creating the so-called "Mongolian state" in the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan to gradually realize its conspiracy to annex China. The Chinese people have repeatedly endured such situations, which no country or nation can tolerate, in the hope of Japan's eventual awakening. The government has repeatedly instructed the people to explain the meaning of tolerance. The people can understand the government's difficulties. Even if there are occasional unfortunate incidents between the Chinese and Japanese people, the fault may not lie with China, and the Chinese government will resolve them satisfactorily in accordance with the principle of friendship. In the past three years, Japan's trade with China has increased year by year. In the first six months of this year, it almost ranked first. This proves that China has no anti-Japanese behavior. As for the evacuation of Japanese residents in various places after the Lugouqiao Incident, this was purely a planned action by Japan, intended to plan for the safety of Japanese residents and facilitate the violence of the Japanese army. When the Japanese residents were evacuated, the Chinese authorities still provided various conveniences and managed their property on their behalf, which is in stark contrast to the various difficulties imposed by Japanese authorities on Chinese residents when they left Japan. However, tolerance has its limits. As Japan's acts of oppression and aggression continue to increase, the Chinese people can no longer endure it and have to rise up to resist and exercise their natural right of self-defense. But even in the midst of the war of resistance, the Chinese people do not consider the entire Japanese people as their enemy, but rather a small number of aggressive warlords. What the Chinese people want to eliminate is not the legitimate businesses of Japanese residents in China, but rather the Japanese warlords' acts of aggression against China. In short, China has no anti-foreign behavior at all, and initially there was no anti-Japanese incident. The current unfortunate situation is entirely caused by Japan's continuous acts of aggression and oppression. The Japanese statement claims that the recent cause of the Sino-Japanese situation in North China was due to China violating the so-called "He-Umezu Agreement" and dispatching central troops to the north. In Shanghai, it was due to China disregarding the Shanghai Truce Agreement and entering the demilitarized zone. Therefore, the Japanese military actions in Hebei and Shanghai were purely self-defense measures and did not violate the Nine-Power Treaty. This tone is purely sophistry and ignores the facts. How the Lugouqiao Incident and the Shanghai Hongqiao Airport Incident occurred due to Japanese military provocations, how the Chinese government exhausted its efforts to seek a peaceful resolution, how the Japanese government lacked peaceful sincerity and concentrated a large number of naval, land, and air forces to attack the Chinese army, and how the Chinese army had no choice but to rise up and fight back, how the Japanese army brutally killed non-combatants and destroyed Chinese cultural institutions have all been repeatedly announced by the Chinese government, and many objective and truthful reports have been published in Chinese and foreign newspapers. The League of Nations General Assembly also had a fair and detailed report and resolution on October 6. Who is the aggressor and who is defending themselves? The facts are all there; how can they be covered up by clever words? Moreover, the Chinese government's free deployment of national troops within its own borders is an exercise of national sovereignty and is not subject to any restrictions. If it is said that Japan can dispatch a large army to invade Chinese territory, while China has no right to send troops for defense, then there is no such reason in the world. As for the Shanghai Truce Agreement, in recent years, the illegal entry of Japanese troops into the demilitarized zone in Shanghai has been heard and witnessed by Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai. When the Shanghai Incident broke out, the Japanese army openly used the Public Concession as a base for military operations, which is even more well-known to the world. Since the Japanese army had repeatedly violated the Truce Agreement in advance, how can China be blamed for adhering to it later? Japan is a signatory country to the Nine-Power Treaty, which clearly stipulates respect for China's sovereignty and territorial and administrative integrity. That is, Japan has an obligation to respect China's sovereignty and territorial and administrative integrity. Now, without any real reason, it has sent more than 500,000 naval, land, and air forces to invade China, occupy cities, massacre people, and trample on land, while still claiming that it is a "self-defense measure," still claiming that it has no territorial ambitions, and still thinking that it does not violate the Nine-Power Treaty. Who in the world will believe it? The Japanese statement and the reply to the Belgian ambassador to Japan repeatedly mention the Chinese Communist Party and the issue of communism, and claim that communism and anti-Japanese policies are both obstacles to peace between China and Japan. This is purely false propaganda that the world will not believe. China's national policy is based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. For the past ten years, the Chinese Nationalist Party and the National Government have made the greatest efforts and sacrifices to eliminate the violence and redification policies of the Communist Party. The details of this process are well known to the world and do not need to be repeated. Recently, the Chinese Communist Party, in view of China's increasingly urgent foreign aggression and the only way to save the country and survive is to follow the Three Principles of the People, formally announced on September 22: (1) Abandoning the policy of violence; (2) Stopping the redification movement; (3) Abolishing the Soviet organization; (4) Abolishing the Red Army. Therefore, in today's China, everyone follows the Three Principles of the People, and the people of the whole country, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, are fighting together to resist foreign aggression and realize the lofty ideals of the Three Principles of the People. No matter how clever the Japanese propaganda is, it is difficult to conceal the obvious facts. In short, the unfortunate situation between China and Japan is entirely due to Japan's continued aggression against China. If the Japanese government abandons its consistent policy of aggression, stops its acts of aggression, and withdraws its aggressive forces, it will not be difficult for peace to reappear in East Asia.

### U.S. Representative States Respect for China's Position

Ambassador Koo Says Minimum Requirement for Adjustment is Compliance with Treaty and Guarantee of Territorial Integrity. Conference Work to be Carried Out in Two Stages.

[Paris] Koo Vi-kyuin, chief representative of China attending the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, stated today that while China is willing for the Sino-Japanese War to be terminated through the mediation of various countries, Japan must respect its promises made to the Nine-Power Treaty. China is prepared to attend the conference and accept a peaceful solution in accordance with international law. In short, China is prepared to accept a mediation method based on the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. What we firmly demand is the survival of the nation-state. Koo also stated that China does not want to engage in direct negotiations suggested by Japan. We are determined to remain committed to the League of Nations and the Nine-Power Treaty. Therefore, we believe that all peace proposals must not be made through these two channels. China's current position is that of being invaded. Japan is not only destroying the Nine-Power Treaty and endangering China's survival, but is also trampling on the status of other signatory countries. Koo also expressed his great hope for the success of the conference, but expressed disappointment at Japan's refusal to attend, and said that Japan's arrogant attitude can be described as another proof of its contempt for the treaties it has signed. This kind of action that does not respect treaties not only harms the parties involved in China, but also has a great relationship with the security of the world. Therefore, today's Japanese problem in China is by no means an occasional problem, but a major problem for the survival of international society and culture. Today, if we want to seek peace and security, we must first restore the observance of treaty obligations. If this principle cannot be re-established, there will be no possibility of peace in the world, and there will be no hope for the continuation of culture. (One-day National Telegram)

Brussels. The U.S. delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference today stated that the U.S. would not endorse any plan to resolve the Sino-Japanese War unless it was fully accepted by China. Another source said that U.S. officials were very concerned about the issue of a ceasefire, but have now decided to reject any peace measures that would be detrimental to China. However, if the Nine-Power Treaty Conference can stop the Sino-Japanese War, or propose another conference to seek a complete solution to the Far East issue, there is no preconceived notion among the representatives of various countries as to whether such a conference is necessary. However, judging from their initial discussions, the UK, France, and the U.S. may support this plan, as such a conference may lay the cornerstone for guaranteeing China's freedom and ensuring the interests of European and American countries in the Far East. It is also possible that a new treaty will be signed later to replace the current Nine-Power Treaty and the Washington Naval Treaty. (31st National Telegram)

Brussels. Today, according to reliable sources, the move by the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to mediate the Sino-Japanese War may fail due to China's request that the signatory countries to the treaty take joint action against Japan. It is reported that China's request will be based on the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty guaranteeing China's territorial integrity and political independence. This move will make the representatives of the UK, U.S., and France feel very thorny, as the three countries have agreed in advance that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference should first achieve a ceasefire between China and Japan, and then begin negotiations to seek a lasting peace. According to the U.S. delegation, the agenda is roughly set as follows: First, the representatives of various countries will make speeches for two days, and then ask the Chinese representative to explain the terms of the ceasefire that can be accepted, and then send another invitation to Japan to attend the conference and explain Japan's position and conditions for resolution. If Japan refuses to attend again, the various countries will separately find out the terms of the ceasefire from Japan. After the attitudes of China and Japan are clear, the various countries will use mediation methods at the conference to seek a compromise. However, judging from the current situation, the attitudes of China and Japan are very different, and reconciliation is quite difficult. (One-day National Telegram)

Brussels. Today, according to reliable sources from private sources, Japan intends to accept the U.S. as a mediator to resolve the Far East situation, but China's government must first agree to direct negotiations with Japan. It is reported that most of Japan, except for a few warlords, hopes to end the war before it becomes unmanageable. (31st National Telegram)

### Soviet Russia Has High Expectations for the United States

Litvinov Leads Delegation to Brussels. Pacific Institute Advocates Economic Sanctions

[Moscow] After the Soviet government accepted Belgium's invitation to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, it appointed Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Litvinov, Deputy Commissar Bodankin, and Minister to Belgium Rubinin as representatives. Litvinov and Bodankin left for Brussels at 10 p.m. last night. Belgian Minister to the Soviet Union Ledellier and many senior Soviet government officials were at the station to see them off. According to Soviet political figures, the Soviet delegation has high expectations for the U.S. attitude at this conference and believes that the only way to stop Japan's aggression against China is to rely on the U.S. This is because the UK is prepared to support any compromise plan that will protect its interests in China and does not intend to take any further action. In the U.S., both President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull have made speeches condemning Japan's aggression and stating that the U.S. should not remain isolated for long. Soviet political figures have expressed their appreciation for this attitude and believe that although there are still many people in the U.S. who tend to be isolationist, they hope that Roosevelt and Hull will put their words into action. In addition, the Soviet delegation will definitely support the proposal that all peace-loving countries must form a united front to deal with aggressor countries at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. However, it is not yet known whether the Soviet Union will put forward specific proposals on this matter. (Central News Agency 31st Havas Telegram)

[Rome] The Italian delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference left here this morning for Brussels. The delegation is headed by Count Maresti Scoti, a former member of the Lytton Commission, and includes senior officials and experts from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Central News Agency 1st Havas Telegram)

Toronto, Canada. Carter, Director General of the Pacific Institute, said in a public speech here today that if the Nine-Power Treaty Conference cannot launch economic sanctions against Japan, the peace in the Far East may be delayed for three or four years before it can be realized. Carter quoted British economist Keynes as saying, "Economic sanctions are at least nine-tenths effective, and their success is of great value to both the present and the future." As for the Italian-Ethiopian War, which did not stop due to sanctions, Carter believes that Italy is a continental country, while Japan is an island country, which can be blockaded. However, economic sanctions are the last step and should only be implemented after diplomatic methods have completely failed. (31st National Telegram)

[Washington] According to economists here today, whether Japan's industry will develop in the future depends on this war against China. This war against China is the peak of Japan's entry into the industrial era since it broke its isolationist state. If Japan does not exhaust its national economic power in this war and wins the final victory in China, its industry will inevitably make significant progress and endanger the commerce of various countries in the world. On the contrary, if Japan is defeated by China or its domestic economic power is exhausted and it enters a state of collapse, then the various countries can not worry about the competition of Japanese goods. (31st National Telegram)

[London] The "Yorkshire Post," which is known as the mouthpiece of Foreign Secretary Eden, recently published an article commenting on the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, saying, "The presence of U.S. Representative Davis at this conference is extremely important. Unfortunately, the atmosphere before the opening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is rather bleak. One is that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini decided not to send Foreign Minister Ciano to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The second is that the Italian government has recalled its ambassador to France, Cerutti. The third is that the political turmoil in Belgium is still unsettled. The fourth is that the solution to the problem of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War is further delayed. With all these, the future of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is ominous. However, the purpose of the conference is not to provide an opportunity for diplomatic talks, but to find a way to quickly end the war in China, which is well known to us. It is also not unimportant that President Roosevelt's confidant Davis is officially representing the U.S. at this conference. Foreign Secretary Eden will be traveling to Brussels in the next few days, presumably to take the opportunity to meet with Davis before the opening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to discuss the situation in the Far East."

Current Affairs Commentary

### Mourning the Four British Soldiers

— Yi

Today, Japanese warlords are using brutal aggression to destroy world justice and peace. The most valuable thing is the brave soldiers who defend justice and humanity. Under the chaos of aircraft and artillery bombardment by the invaders, the British garrison in Shanghai has always resolutely guarded the concession defense zone without giving the invaders the slightest convenience. Therefore, in recent days, there have been daily casualties among the British army. The martyrdom of the four soldiers on Bailinan Road is an especially shocking tragedy for the world, but it has also further promoted the spirit of justice in the world.

In addition to the spirit of justice, the humanitarian spirit shown by the British garrison in Shanghai is also deeply admirable to us. Here, let me excerpt a passage from a record (see this newspaper on the 28th) as an example. It describes the scene of British soldiers helping refugees at the Fanwangdu Bridge: "…They rolled up their sleeves and used their strong, hairy arms to carry one or two crying children at a time from the other side of the bridge, and supported or carried frail old women or women who were unable to walk across the bridge. They carried burdens of clothes or rice for the refugees across the bridge. They were sweating. Time after time. In the two hours I was there, they were always so sincere in helping the refugees as if they were their own family. I saw with my own eyes the refugees shedding tears of gratitude to them. I heard with my own ears the words of thanks spoken by the refugees from the bottom of their hearts. I know that although they do not understand, they are not hoping for people's thanks. For the first time, I saw true "humans."

We will never forget the spirit of justice and humanity of the British army in Shanghai. Therefore, the tragedy of Bailinan Road caused by the enemy's bombs on the 29th of last month cannot but move us to tears. Yesterday, when the four British soldiers were buried, dozens of Chinese organizations sent representatives to pay their respects, which was a very appropriate expression. We feel that although the bodies of these four soldiers have been buried underground, their spirit of martyrdom will always remain in the hearts of countless people around the world who uphold justice and humanity. Their death is immortal.

### Philippine People Condemn Japanese Aggression

And Advocate Economic Boycott; Australian Trade Union Federation Declares Boycott of Japanese Goods

[Manila] The Philippine Democratic Political Guarantee Alliance yesterday passed a resolution: "Urging the Philippine people to unanimously condemn Japan's aggressive acts of slaughtering Chinese non-combatants, immediately launch a fundraising campaign to relieve the wounded and refugees, and prepare for economic boycott against Japan." It is understood that the Philippine Democratic Political Guarantee Alliance is a private Philippine independence organization, representing labor, students, civilian groups, etc. Only over a thousand members attended yesterday's meeting. The rest of the citizens were not allowed to participate for fear of disturbing order. In addition to Filipinos, one person each from China, Britain, and the United States spoke at the scene, and many people from France and Spain also participated. Yesterday's resolution also stated that the Philippines should support all international actions to stop Japan's crimes of conquering other countries. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 1st)

Melbourne The Australian Trade Union Federation Executive Committee today issued a declaration, asking all Australians to boycott Japanese goods and immediately stop exporting military supplies to Japan, without hesitation due to retaliation and threats.

### France Plans to Build a Naval Port in Annam

Between Hong Kong and Singapore

[Washington] According to a report obtained by the Pacific Relations Research Association, France is now planning to establish a strong naval base in Lanlang (transliteration) on the east coast of Annam. Lanlang's location is conveniently between Hong Kong and Singapore, and it is on a straight line with Hong Kong and Singapore, with almost equal distances. Therefore, once this naval base is completed, it can greatly strengthen the policies and cooperation of Britain and France in the Pacific. (National Telegraph, 31st)

### Kong Xiangxi's Original Speech at the Central Memorial Week Meeting

Describing the Experience of Being Sent Abroad and Personal Thoughts

[Nanjing] The Central Party Headquarters held a Memorial Week for the Leader this morning. All working comrades attended. After paying their respects led by Committee Member Kong Xiangxi, he delivered a speech on the spot. His original words are as follows: "Comrades, Xiangxi has just returned from his mission abroad. Upon the order of the Central Government, I will attend today's Memorial Week to deliver a report. Due to time constraints, I can only describe the experience of this trip and my personal thoughts. This time, I was ordered to go to England to attend the coronation of the British King and to inspect the economic construction of Europe and the United States along the way. I visited various countries and had sincere discussions with their leaders in both the government and the opposition. The gracious hospitality of the various countries to the delegation is still unforgettable. This situation is definitely not just a personal affection for Xiangxi. It is because our country has achieved significant results in all constructions under the decision-making of the Central Government and the leadership of President Jiang over the years. Therefore, it can arouse the respect of various countries. Even the Lugou Bridge Incident has already occurred, and economic cooperation, such as issuing railway bonds in England and loans from other countries, can still proceed smoothly. And when the nationwide war of resistance broke out, it was originally planned to return to the country immediately to join the national crisis, but the international liaison affairs were not yet concluded, so it was delayed again. Fortunately, after more than a month of negotiations, the international community gradually became sympathetic to us. The League of Nations decided to convene a Nine-Power Treaty Conference and notified all member states that they should not obstruct our self-defense and resistance. Military assistance has also become more convenient. Both spiritual and material aspects have achieved considerable success. It is also because our loyal and brave soldiers are fighting bloody battles on the front lines, and the whole country is united under the guidance of the leader, showing people that we cannot be humiliated. As the saying goes, "God helps those who help themselves." Now I feel this is more credible. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference will be opened soon. The establishment of the Nine-Power Treaty originated from the Washington Conference. At that time, the European war had ended, and countries around the world were in pain during the war, knowing that Europe could temporarily be at peace, but the Pacific was still full of crises. Japan would take advantage of the opportunity of the World War to propose the Twenty-One Demands to our country and the Nishihara loans to control China, and then dominate Asia and take the lead in the world. It was a hidden danger to the future of peace in East Asia. Therefore, the Nine-Power Treaty was initiated to eliminate it in advance. Fortunately, the Meiji faction in Japan was in power at that time and had a world vision, so they were able to participate in the signing. However, the Japanese warlords still have the traditional militaristic concept, and their ambitions have not diminished. For more than ten years, they have used Pan-Asianism to instigate European and American countries in East Asian territories. The Japanese Empire has advocated declaring war on Britain. This has been seen in Japanese books and newspapers. Recently, there have been rumors of breaking off diplomatic relations with Britain. For example, in 1898, they opposed the United States' inclusion of Hawaii into its territory, and declared that the construction of the navy was to target the United States, and the army was to oppose the Soviet Union. It was not enough to show off its power in the Pacific, and it even planned to marry off Japanese soldiers to the Abyssinian prince in order to get involved in Africa. Judging from their ambitions, they actually want to encroach on the great powers and dominate the world. Since the 918 Incident, the great powers and our country have been trying to resolve the issue peacefully out of concern for peace in East Asia. However, the Japanese warlords have the desire to gain an inch. Although they have been advocating sweet words of the same text, the same species, coexistence, co-prosperity, and friendship, the fact of invading the territory and massacring the people has not stopped. Since the start of the all-out war of resistance, airplanes bombing civilians has been heard every day. Their cruelty is becoming more and more evident, and they are abandoning humanity. Based on this fact, judging from their ambitions, it is not just a matter for our country. It will inevitably affect friendly countries along the Pacific coast. It is expected that at the opening of the conference, all peace-loving and justice-upholding friendly countries will impose effective sanctions on the militaristic Japanese warlord government. As for our country, at a time when the strong enemy is showing off its violence, in order to seek the survival of the country and the nation, we have only to be determined to sacrifice to the end to resist the war. International sympathy is enough to give us encouragement. In the future, we should work harder to achieve final success. We deeply express our respect and trust for the efforts of various friendly countries to uphold justice and maintain peace. We especially hope that sensible and understanding people in Japan will urge the domestic warlords to wake up as soon as possible, so as to preserve the reputation of their country and the virtues of mankind, and avoid falling into a state of eternal doom. This is what our country hopes for them to wake up and extricate themselves from. (Central News Agency, 1st)

### Hebei Provincial Bank Notes Stop Being Used

Does Not Affect the Credit of the Legal Tender

[Nanjing] Recently, Hebei Provincial Bank notes have flowed into Henan and Shandong provinces in large quantities with the army and refugees. In Zhengzhou and other places, they are not easy to circulate, and there have been various incidents of forced circulation and discounted use, causing repeated disputes in the market. The Ministry of Finance has already received an order from President Chiang to telegraph to the provinces of Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai on October 27, ordering that all provincial notes flowing out of the Hebei and Chahar provinces be stopped for use, and that the original issuing bank be responsible for making arrangements for consolidation and redemption. The reporter asked the relevant parties whether the suspension of the issuance of this provincial note would cause misunderstandings. It was told that: ⑴ The circulation of provincial notes should be limited to the province and should not be circulated outside the province. ⑵ The issuance of banknotes by the Hebei Provincial Bank has not been approved by the Central Government and is equivalent to privately issued notes. Its issuance reserve fund is also insufficient. It is different from the other banks' banknotes, the reserve fund of which is legally managed by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee and checked and announced on a regular basis. ⑶ The provinces of Hebei and Chahar are now in a state of chaos. The President of the Hebei Provincial Bank has transferred the head office to the person appointed by the Security Maintenance Association established by the enemy garrison due to its inability to resist the puppet order. This is because the bank's foundation has been shaken and it has been hijacked and used by the enemy. The suspension of its circulation now is a necessary measure and will not affect the credit of the legal tender. (Central News Agency, 1st)

### Mediterranean Unrest: Italian Planes Bomb and Sink British Ship

British Crew Reports Bombing Ordeal: Sixteen Bombs Dropped, Crew Rescued

(Central News Agency, 31st Reuters dispatch)

Barcelona: The crew of the British ship "GWemyss" reported to Reuters that the plane attacking the ship bore a skull and crossbones symbol.

All crew members safely arrived in lifeboats at the port of Cala Rajols near Girona the other day. (Central News Agency, 31st Reuters dispatch)

Palma, Majorca Island: A Havas News Agency reporter recently inspected the construction of the Nationalist naval base on the Spanish Balearic Island of Majorca in the Mediterranean. The construction plan was originally conceived by Nationalist Commander-in-Chief General Franco during his tenure as fortress commander of the Balearic Islands. The main point is to excavate huge tunnels along the coastal rocks to serve as aircraft bases and to place artillery positions in such a way that they cannot be detected from the sea, thus making it impossible to attack them. The project is currently overseen by Vice Admiral Paul Nantai. Once completed, Majorca Island will become one of the most important naval fortresses in the Mediterranean. Currently, all warships belonging to the Nationalists are concentrated on Majorca Island. The officers of each ship have been replenished because, of the original 1,000 officers in the Spanish Navy, 550 have been executed, 375 are serving with the Nationalists, and 75 remain loyal to the Republican government. To fill the vacancies, the Nationalists have had to conscript merchant sailors into the navy. In addition, the Nationalist authorities are recruiting a large number of new soldiers from among the 350,000 residents of Majorca Island to form an army, which is commanded by General Canovas. Furthermore, General Franco's brother, Colonel Franco, is also serving as the air force commander on Majorca Island. Among the Balearic Islands, only Minorca Island is still occupied by the government forces, with a population of 50,000. The coastline is equipped with the latest coastal artillery, defended by 7,000 troops, several warships, and four squadrons of aircraft. (Central News Agency, 31st Havas dispatch)

### US Plans to Recruit Volunteers

At Least 500,000

[Washington] The US Army General Staff is currently drafting a plan advocating the establishment of a volunteer recruitment bureau so that, in the event of war, at least 500,000 volunteers can be recruited within two months to strengthen national defense forces. In other words, the bureau's mission is to rapidly increase domestic military strength before the United States implements conscription. The method involves establishing recruitment committees in military strategic locations in each state, chaired by a general officer. Each committee is under the control of the National Defense Forces General Staff. According to the general mobilization procedures drafted by the US Federal Government, in the event of war, the number of National Defense Forces personnel should increase from 375,000 to 1,500,000 within four months. The above volunteer recruitment plan is part of the general mobilization procedures. (Central News Agency, 31st Havas dispatch)

### Four British Soldiers Buried Yesterday Amidst Solemn Grandeur

Representatives from All Sectors of Our Society Attended; Representatives of Japanese Butchers Denied Entry

On the 29th of last month, enemy forces shelled the south bank of the Suzhou Creek, but the aim was inaccurate, and several shells landed in the British garrison defense area of ​​Brittany Road in Vanham Ferry, causing three British soldiers, Howard Mellon and O'Toole, to unfortunately die on the spot. Finn and MacSharry were seriously injured, and Finn also died in the hospital. The British garrison authorities held a funeral ceremony for these four unfortunate martyrs at 2:30 p.m. yesterday. A battalion of British soldiers, led by senior military officers, participated, and military officers stationed in Shanghai from various countries also sent personnel to participate, but the representative of the Japanese butchers was refused entry. All sectors of our country deeply sympathize with these four British soldiers who sacrificed themselves for human justice, and those who went to hold the coffin included representatives from dozens of institutions and groups such as the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Banking Association, the Education Association, the Local Association, the Anti-Enemy Support Association, the Cultural Circles Salvation Association, the Special No. 2 District City Federation, the Western Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Truck Industry Association, the Youth Association, the Commercial Press, the Journalists Association, the Lawyers Association, and the Women's Association.

Thousands of people. At 2:30 p.m., four hearses departed from the International Funeral Home, led by the British Army band playing mournful music, which was very solemn and solemn. At about 3 o'clock, they arrived at the International Cemetery and held a burial ceremony, which lasted about half an hour. When the procession was underway, those who stopped to pay their respects on both sides of the road were countless, and the mourning was extremely glorious. However, two enemy planes circled back and forth in the sky, and the sound of artillery fire in the western district was incessant. While we are remembering the four martyrs of this friendly country, we can't help but think of the Japanese warlords, the executioners of humanity, who are carrying out their slaughter work, which further increases our feelings of indignation.

Anti-Enemy Association Condolences: The Anti-Enemy Support Association of all circles in this city held a memorial service yesterday at the International Funeral Home for the three British soldiers Otto Mellin and Howard stationed on Brittany Road who were killed by enemy shells.

### Various Aspects of the Former Capital After the Fall (1)

— Zhu Jingxin

Seventy-Odd Days of Observations

Since the night of July 7, when the sound of gunfire suddenly erupted at the Lugou Bridge, the Sino-Japanese War gradually unfolded. By July 27, the conflict in Langfang (an important railway station between Tianjin and Beijing) had escalated into resistance in the suburbs of Beijing. Late at night on July 28, the defending forces moved south, and Beijing, the ancient capital of our dynasties, fell into the hands of the enemy. 1.6 million compatriots were also reduced to a sub-human existence under the iron hooves of the enemy. Due to various difficulties after the incident, I, the reporter, was unable to flee south immediately, and was therefore able to witness various conditions in the former capital after its fall, lasting for more than seventy days. I only secretly escaped on the ninth of this month, detouring through Dalian, Qingdao, Jinan, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, and other places, arriving in Wuhan yesterday. Now I will briefly describe what I saw.

1. Traitors Actively Engage

Beijing was the political center of the north, and the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council was originally located here. On the evening of July 28, Song Zheyuan decided to leave Beijing and announced that Zhang Zizhong would act as the chairman of the council and also serve as the mayor of Beijing, responsible for handling everything. Except for one brigade of Ruan Xuanwu's 29th Army, which was renamed the Security Force and remained in Beijing to assist the police in maintaining local order, the rest were all withdrawn. At the same time, Pan Yugui was appointed as the director of the police bureau. Zhang and Pan took office simultaneously on August 1. When Mr. Pan took office, he said that the Japanese army would never enter the city (Pan had a deep relationship with the Japanese side, and was dismissed from his post as director of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Office because of this). On August 2, the Japanese side notified Zhang Zizhong, ordering Ruan's troops to disarm immediately and go to Huangsi to await orders, causing Zhang to be unable to take responsibility barehanded. On the 5th, he was forced to resign, and the area was in a state of anarchy, temporarily maintained only by the police bureau.

The activities of traitors were far before the Lugouqiao Incident. After the incident, the powerful faction advocated war, and the traitor faction advocated peace. As soon as the war started, the traitors began to act wildly. Leng Jiaji, former chairman of the Beijing Chamber of Commerce, and Zhou Zhaoxiang, former governor of Hunan Province, invited so-called local dignitaries and rose up in response to the times, running to the doors of the Japanese special service agencies every day, using the great rivers and mountains as gifts for their promotion and wealth. Song Zheyuan's departure from Beijing was due to them taking advantage of the opportunity, claiming that the Japanese would launch a large-scale bombing of Beijing, and asking him to leave in the name of considering the lives and property of 1.6 million people. Later, when the goal was reached, a new organization was brewing, using the local maintenance society as the first step in seizing power. Leng Zhou and others, fearing that they would be difficult to obtain Japanese permission because their qualifications were not convincing, intimidated Jiang Chaozong, a former Qing official, to come out of retirement to serve as the chairman of the association. Jiang declined once due to his old age, but in fact his fingers had long been twitching. The Maintenance Association began operating on August 10, but they announced its establishment on August 1. A large number of Japanese were hired as consultants, and famous figures from all walks of life were forcibly pulled in as members and consultants. Since the position of mayor of Beijing had been vacant for a long time after Zhang Zizhong was forced to step down, Leng Pan and others all coveted it and were running around every day. However, the Japanese believed that they were commoners in the market and could not bear the important task, so they instructed the Maintenance Association to use public opinion to publicly elect Jiang Chaozong as the mayor concurrently. The heads of all bureaus were also replaced, and the traitors of all sizes were able to enjoy the addiction of being officials. Local ruffians actually became high-ranking officials, such as Li Jisi, director of the Public Works Bureau, who was originally a staff member of a certain railway bureau. He went to the bureau to work every day, and in the afternoon he took over as the director of the bureau. The strange shapes and jokes were endless, and there were still many people who ran around every day. Goblins and monsters acted like ghosts, shamelessly serving their enemies and showing no shame. In fact, the power of all institutions was in the hands of Japanese consultants. The administration, income, expenses, and employment of all institutions, even a small amount of money, would be invalid without their signature and permission. Even under such circumstances, the hearts of the traitors to fight for power and profit were still soaring. For example, the tram company had better business income in Beijing. Jiang Chaozong, in the name of the Maintenance Association, appointed himself as the chairman of the board and all the members as directors and supervisors. After being rebuked and stopped by the Japanese, he withdrew his order himself. Their ignorance of shame can be said to have reached its peak at this point. In addition to the traitor group's Maintenance Association, another group of traitors, such as Xu Lanzhou, established the so-called "North China People's Self-Government Association" on August 27, competing with the Maintenance Association for the priority of selling out the country. More recently, another group of traitors has organized the Greater East Asia Alliance, which is also an agency for competing for power and profit, brewing to establish a puppet government in North China and placing the people in a place of no return.

The traitors flattered the Japanese in different ways, racking their brains. For example, because Beijing did not suffer war damage during the incident, a group of traitors attributed it to the Japanese army. They called themselves representatives in the name of protecting life and property, and requested to see the head of the Japanese special service agency, Matsui, and made a statement in person, requesting that a bronze statue be built for him in front of Tiananmen Square. Matsui, fearing the rumors of his country, immediately refused. They must not give up, and changed to sending a letter of thanks, with humble words and vulgar words that not only they are grateful, but also their descendants will be grateful, in order to win a smile. The personality of the Chinese nation has been completely swept away by them.

Recent news has come that the Japanese blamed Yin Rugeng for the uprising of the Tongxian Security Force, the killing of Japanese expatriates, and arrested him for interrogation in Dalian. It is reported that he has been shot. The result of serving as an accomplice to the tiger is like this, which can serve as a warning. When the general traitors heard the news, they were also terrified.

### General Labor Union Raises Funds to Comfort Wounded Soldiers

Currently Casting Commemorative Medals for the Songhu Resistance

In order to comfort the heroic soldiers who have been wounded, the General Labor Union of this city has raised funds to prepare resistance commemorative medals to be distributed to the soldiers as permanent souvenirs. The titles of each donor are listed below: Zhan Xinxian 50 yuan, Zhou Dexin 30 yuan, Cheng Zhenlai 10 yuan, Dai Songlai 10 yuan, Chen Caibao 20 yuan, He Shudao 20 yuan, Xu Zhixiang and Guo Shangjin 20 yuan each, Li Yaoting 20 yuan, Li Fenglai 20 yuan, Li Yougeng 10 yuan, Zhang Jing'an 20 yuan, Yang Guanzhao 50 yuan, Lou Yinchuan 50 yuan, Zhang Shulin 20 yuan, Qi Lianzhang 20 yuan, Yu Rupin 50 yuan, Shao Xubai 20 yuan, Zhou Xuexiang 30 yuan, Zhu Xuefan 30 yuan, Long Peiyun 20 yuan, totaling 540 yuan. It is reported that the badges are bronze in color, engraved with the words "Songhu Resistance Commemorative," and a steel helmet is drawn in the middle, engraved with the words "National Hero," tied with a red ribbon, which is quite exquisite and lovely. The union will send personnel to various wounded soldiers' hospitals to distribute them separately in the near future.

### Ambassador Wang Works Hard to Raise National Bonds

Facilitating Deposits and Bond Purchases; Suggesting Rent-for-Bonds Method

The Women's Group for Fundraising for National Salvation Bonds received a telegram yesterday from Ambassador Wang stationed in the United States to Madame Kong, the director of the group, stating that they will follow up on mobilizing the forces of the overseas Chinese women's community and will report the results in the near future.

Deposit Booklets Can Be Used to Purchase Bonds

The General Assembly of the National Salvation Bonds Fundraising Committee stated that, according to people's applications, they will use deposit booklets to purchase national bonds. They have contacted various banks separately, and all banks can provide support and facilitate payment. It has now been learned that Jin Cheng Bank has replied to the General Assembly, agreeing to facilitate the handling of 28 deposit booklets, totaling more than 7,000 yuan, from depositors Xiang Meiying and others in the bank. The Shanghai Industrial Trust Company has also agreed to facilitate the payment of 10,000 yuan in deposits from depositor Fang Zhemin, and the China National Goods Bank has also agreed to facilitate the payment of 110 yuan in deposits from depositor Weng Muzong.

Suggestions from the Special Zone Citizens' Association

The Eighth District Branch of the Citizens' United Association of the Special Area in this port specially suggested to the National Salvation Bonds Fundraising Committee on the implementation of methods for purchasing national salvation bonds with rent: ⑴ Notify all landlords in the city to use one month's rent as the standard to subscribe to national bonds in full; ⑵ Tenants can subscribe on behalf of the landlords and pay to the designated bank. In exchange for rent tickets for any month when collecting rent, ⑶ The period is until the end of November, and the bank should be paid on time. If it is found that a neighborhood or household has not yet purchased bonds on behalf of them within the time limit, they will be ordered to pay. The bond raising will continue until the bonds are fully raised. ⑷ The investigation work will be undertaken by the citizens' branch associations in the two special districts. ⑸ Owners should notify tenants separately to implement this. ⑹ For Chinese industries managed by foreign merchants, they should also be handled in the same way.

### Pudong Army-People Joint Celebration Meeting

The number of attendees totaled more than 1,300. Yu Xilai and others were publicly elected as the presidium. In addition to performances by the Vanguard Song Club, the Salvation New Drama Troupe, and the Air Defense and Anti-Poisoning Troupe, Guo Moruo, Tian Han, Xia Yan, Shi Mai, Xin and other leaders of the Shanghai cultural community were invited to give speeches on the path to national salvation by the people and various issues such as rural relief. The audience was moved by everything. Finally, four children, Hu Xiangqin, Hu Juqiu, Li Mingmin, and Zhang Weiwei, on behalf of all the people, presented flags and flowers to the military commander to show their comfort and respect.

### Not Ashamed of Being the Daughter of a Military Family, a Girl Donates Money to Comfort the Troops

Since the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our soldiers on the front line have been bravely fighting the enemy and sacrificing their lives on the battlefield. The people in the rear are enthusiastically contributing and donating money to comfort these heroes who are seeking the survival of the country and the nation, fulfilling the natural duties of the people and expressing their determination to resist the enemy. Yesterday, this newspaper received two national dollars from five-year-old Liu Nongsun, which was the money she saved from her daily candy allowance to comfort the soldiers on the front line, and she personally wrote, "These two dollars are for my father's comrades." Her father, Liu Yun Jia, is also one of the members in the War of Resistance Against Japan. ××

### Both Guangdong and Guangxi Students in Shanghai Sent a Telegram to Chairman Chiang and Others to Pay Respects

Protecting the Country and Defending the Territory is Admired by All; Please Implement the Policy Thoroughly to Comfort the Hopes of the People

Since its establishment, the Guangdong and Guangxi Students' Anti-Enemy Support Association in Shanghai has been engaged in education and national salvation work, which is extremely tense. Considering that the start of the national resistance depends on the leadership of the government, which has dealt a heavy blow to the violent enemy, Tan Qixiang, chairman of the association, and all members jointly sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang and Wu, chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, General Commander Yu, Commander-in-Chief Li of the Nanjing Military Commission, and Deputy Commander Bai, to express their condolences and pledge to be the backing force.

### Urgent Order for Registration of Jointly Published Publications

Various Suspended Publications Must Also Be Reported and Investigated According to Law

Since the outbreak of the August 13th Resistance War, many of the publications originally registered in this city have been temporarily suspended due to the impact of the war, or have been jointly published by several publishing houses. The question of whether these publications should be subject to re-registration or change of registration has been submitted by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to the Municipal Government for instructions. The bureau has received Instruction No. 2144 from the Municipal Government, which states, "The matter is noted. Publications jointly published by various publishing houses should be regarded as new publications and must be registered in accordance with Article 9 of the Publications Law. If publishing houses themselves have temporarily suspended publication due to the impact of the war, they should also report to the local competent authorities for forwarding to the Ministry of the Interior in accordance with Article 24 of the Implementing Regulations of the Publications Law. It is imperative that you separately forward this order for compliance." Yesterday, Special Order No. 2415 was issued, ordering that all publishing houses in this city that have temporarily suspended publication due to the impact of the war must submit a report on the suspension to the bureau for forwarding before November 10th. Those who jointly publish publications with several publishing houses must also apply for registration in accordance with the law.

### Nanshi Remains Peaceful as Before

Shops Open as Usual, Police Maintain Order; French Authorities Send Troops to Protect the Waterworks Director

Yesterday, our reporter made a special trip to Nanshi to investigate and found that the situation there was still very stable. Most of the shops on Zhaojiabang Road, Fangbang Road, Xiaodongmen, and other major streets were still open for business. The police and trained citizens maintained order as usual, with a calm and composed attitude. However, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifice, many citizens withdrew. Therefore, around 8 a.m., vehicles moving belongings filled the roads around Xiaoximen and Laobeimen. By 10 a.m., the traffic there was even more congested, and the transportation lines were almost cut off. Fortunately, the police directed traffic effectively, and order was maintained well.

Around 10 a.m. yesterday, an enemy plane flew over Nanshi to reconnoiter, then left without dropping any bombs.

The French Concession's waterworks director is located on the Bund outside the Bansongyuan Road in Nanshi. Therefore, yesterday morning, the French military authorities dispatched many French soldiers to protect it closely by vehicle. A French warship has been stationed for a long time at the Qiuxin Factory outside Puzhong. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the water supply.

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that residents of Nanshi have heard rumors that the Japanese army will bomb Nanshi and are now moving into the French and International Concessions. According to Chinese newspapers, the Japanese military authorities notified the consulates of various countries in Shanghai that the Japanese army would bomb Nanshi, so they asked foreigners to evacuate the area. However, according to the French authorities, foreign consulates have not received such notification.

### Czech Minister Pays Courtesy Visit to Mayor Yu

Czech Minister Mr. Cipa has been in China for more than two months and is stationed in the capital. He came to Shanghai on official business the other day. Yesterday (the 1st), at 10 a.m., he made a special trip to the Municipal Government on Fenglin Bridge to pay a courtesy visit to Mayor Yu, exchanging pleasantries for a while before taking his leave.

### Designated Donations for Yang's Battalion Being Distributed

When the Shanghai Municipal Comfort Committee learned that the Yang Battalion's isolated troops of the 88th Division were holding out at the Sihang Warehouse, various parties entrusted them with cash to purchase goods for comfort, such as 200 yuan (National Currency) donated by the China Electrical Workers' Union, 100 yuan donated by the employees of the Fufeng Factory, 40 yuan donated by Guan Yunnong, 40 yuan donated by Zhang Shujun, and other donations, amounting to a considerable sum. Now that the Yang Battalion has safely withdrawn, the committee is distributing the funds for use, hoping not to disappoint the donors. In addition, the committee purchased a large number of blankets, mast lights, and other practical items from the comfort funds the other day and sent staff to deliver them directly to the Yang Battalion. Now that the Yang Battalion has gone to the front line to fight again, please stop sending food and other comfort items to the Yang Battalion from now on, so as not to waste material resources.

### Money Shops Extend Ten-Batch Procedures

The maximum extension period is six months, and all interest for the previous period must be paid in full.

After the Shanghai money shops made accommodations to extend the ten-batch, ten-installment credit loans, since October 31st was a Sunday holiday, all extension procedures were carried out yesterday. The shops were very busy because of this. The extension period ranged from one month to six months, but all interest for the previous period had to be paid in full. Because old loans could not be recovered, new loans were temporarily suspended.

### The Scene in Songjiang After the Enemy Bombing

After the enemy planes indiscriminately bombed Songjiang on the 28th and 29th, the city was deserted, and the residents fled. When the Songhui Inn area at the foot of the West City Wall caught fire, only Yao Chongfu, Zhang Mengxing, and a few others from the Fire Brigade dragged the hoses to put out the fire. Fortunately, the investigators from the People's Committee and Yang Shijie and others assisted in demolishing houses to rescue and maintain traffic, and the Jinghua Market Street in the west of the suspension bridge was spared from spreading fire. Otherwise, the losses would have been even greater. Five bombed corpses under the West City were buried by the Red Cross on the evening of the 30th.

### Pan Gongzhan's Speech Encourages Boy Scouts

Long-term service, review character, and determine future work guidelines

The First Regiment (i.e., Shanghai City) of the Wartime Service Corps of the Boy Scouts of China held its fifth anniversary week at the headquarters of the General Corps on Tianjin Road at 9 a.m. yesterday. Mr. Pan Gongzhan attended the speech and held a group affairs meeting to discuss many important items. The details are recorded as follows:

Pan's Speech: The fifth anniversary week was held at the headquarters of the group yesterday. More than 400 people, including Leng Xueqiao and other officials at all levels, as well as representatives of the sub-groups and directly subordinate large and small teams, attended. Pan Gongzhan gave a speech saying that today is the fifth anniversary week of the First Regiment of the Wartime Service Corps of the Boy Scouts of China, and I feel very excited. Since the Boy Scouts started various tasks on August 13, they have won praise from people from all walks of life and praise from all countries in the world. However, our responsibilities are becoming more and more important. I hope to work hard to serve with the goal of doing one good deed a day. Finally, he said that the withdrawal of our army from Zhabei and Jiangwan is entirely due to strategic relations. I hope that you will continue the spirit of the past and lead the Boy Scouts to serve for a long time and review your own character.

Group Affairs Meeting: The group convened a group affairs meeting last week to discuss the "Proposal to Determine the Future Service Guidelines of This Group." It was decided that: 1. Resist the war to the end and serve to the end; 2. Strengthen the organization and intensify work; 3. Follow the army's movements and pay attention to liaison. "Proposal to Determine the Future Work Steps of This Group" It was decided that: 1. The Boy Scouts who are currently working will continue to hold their original positions; 2. Boy Scouts who do not have jobs in the group will find ways to send them out to serve; 3. The maximum number of people sent out for the first mountain launch is 50 per place; 4. Designated locations for stationing: (A) Suzhou, (B) Songjiang, (C) Kunshan, and (D) Jiaxing. It is also learned that the group has sent staff to take charge of everything for the Boy Scouts stationed in Suzhou and Kunshan. In addition, the group is now recruiting reserve members, who must have proof from the headquarters or a letter of recommendation from the school, and fill out a parental permission form, a volunteer form, and a photo. Those whose procedures are incomplete or who fail the exam will not be admitted. They have won praise from various divisions and brigades on the front line and people from all walks of life. Since our army retreated to the new front line, the team still goes to ×× every day to rescue wounded soldiers, and the rescue work covers the entire war zone. However, because the war zone has moved backward and the road is longer, I deeply feel that the round trip takes a long time, and the prepared ambulances are not enough. I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will consider the soldiers who are fighting bravely against the enemy on the front line. If there are trucks and military vehicles, please donate or lend them generously, so that the team can rescue as widely as possible.

### Inquiry about the Exchange of National Salvation Donation Receipts

Those with official receipts do not need to exchange them again.

The National Salvation Donation Fundraising Committee of this city entrusted Xu Yongzuo Accounting Firm yesterday to exchange official National Salvation Donation receipts so that they can be used to exchange for National Salvation Public Bonds in the future. Our reporter inquired about the details from Xu Yongzuo Accounting Firm yesterday. According to reports, those donors who have received official receipts (with the name of the Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association Fundraising Committee from All Walks of Life and the name of its director printed on the receipt, and the seal of the acting agency) do not need to exchange them again. It is a pity that most donors misunderstand this and come to exchange official receipts, which is a lot of trouble. There are also those who come to exchange receipts for donations from their own institutions and radio stations, which is also a misunderstanding. The acting agencies entrusted by the Fundraising Committee are only banks, money shops, and newspapers, and no other institutions.

### Measures for Treating Seriously Ill Refugees at Night

Doctors on duty from the First and Second Relief Hospitals will go to treat them.

The Health Group of the Shanghai Branch of the Emergency Period Refugee Relief Committee, in view of the fact that the sick refugees in various shelters have either exceeded the consultation time or suddenly develop serious illnesses at night, which is especially pitiful, has specially stipulated the following treatment methods: 1. For each shelter that has not been assigned a doctor, or if there is a doctor but the consultation time has passed, if a refugee living in the shelter suffers from a minor internal or surgical illness, the administrator of the shelter can prepare a note and send the refugee directly to the outpatient department of the relief hospital for consultation and treatment. (The first hospital is located at the original site of the Hangzhou Restaurant on Aiduya Road, and the second hospital is located at the Labor Hospital at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Binshu Road.) 2. For refugees suffering from serious internal or surgical illnesses who cannot move, the administrators of the shelters can call 32327 during the day to contact the group, and at night can call the relief hospital, the first hospital at 96564, or the second hospital at 35457, to ask the resident on-duty doctor to go to the shelter for treatment. 3. Patients going to the relief hospital for outpatient treatment by car can have their transportation expenses reimbursed by the shelters, indicating the date, patient's name, illness, route, and transportation costs, and verifying the reimbursement, but in principle, electric trams, buses, or rickshaws should be used.

### The Important Crossroads That the Whole Country Should Pay Attention To

— Tao Fen

Two years ago, when I was still wandering in London, I read a statement by a spokesperson for the Japanese military headquarters in the London Times one day, and I was so angry that I couldn't eat for a day. At that time, Japanese imperialism, after plundering the four northeastern provinces, had begun to invade the border of Suiyuan. The British newspapers had many complaints about the Japanese army's recklessness, and the spokesperson for the Japanese military headquarters published a statement saying that the Chinese nation was unreasonable and only feared fists. The only way to deal with China was with force. Using force was always effective, and other methods were ineffective. Only the Japanese knew this practical situation best, and Westerners could not understand it. Therefore, he advised Westerners not to interfere, and only look at the results obtained by the Japanese to prove it. This was clearly a public declaration to the world that the Chinese were born with a servile nature, and the only way to deal with China was to use methods to coerce slaves! Japanese Prime Minister Konoe made a public statement to the world without any scruples that he would beat China to its knees, which also showed the same mentality. 'Kneeling' is the state of a slave. In his view, China's 450 million people are just a large group of animals with a servile nature.

But the Chinese, who were regarded as slaves by Japanese imperialism, could no longer endure humiliation and rose up to resist the war in order to maintain the survival of the nation. Japanese imperialism still firmly believed that they could succeed by using methods to deal with slaves, so they made full use of murderous cannons, tanks, machine guns, poison gas, and bombing to carry out large-scale, inhumane massacres in China. Innocent civilians and refugees were subjected to inhumane massacres. But no matter what kind of tragedy the Chinese suffered, they still gritted their teeth and endured the suffering without complaint in order to strive for national survival. The world's attitude was drastically changed, and the crimes of the violent Japanese were fully revealed. We have proved to the world that the Chinese are not animals with only a servile nature, as Japanese imperialism imagined.

But if we want to truly free ourselves from 'slavery', the most important thing is not to fall for the old tricks of Japanese imperialism in the current war of resistance. According to a Reuters dispatch from Brussels on October 30, from a supposedly reliable source, Japan believes that if the Chinese government is willing to negotiate directly with Japan, Japan is willing to have the United States come out to mediate. The dispatch also said that except for a certain clique of warlords stationed in China, all of Japan is eager to stop the war against China and prevent its scope from expanding; and that Japanese leaders are afraid of being easily attacked by the Soviet Union after going deep into China. This news shows that Japanese imperialism has been panicked by our country's heroic resistance; it shows that the Japanese warlords in China have lost the general support of the country; it shows that Japanese imperialism cannot win a protracted war, which means that as long as our country perseveres in the war of resistance, we will surely achieve final victory. But the dispatch said that Japan will never give up the autonomy of the five provinces of North China and the empire of Inner Mongolia, and even add the possession of the area near Shanghai. This means that Japan's so-called 'peace' is equivalent to asking us to 'kneel'. This is why we loudly call out that 'those who advocate compromise and peace are traitors'.

Our government is leading the country in the war of resistance in order to maintain territorial sovereignty. Chairman Chiang has repeatedly stated his determination to resist the war to the end, which is a fact that the world can see. Our people only need to wholeheartedly support the government and Chairman Chiang in resisting the war to the end, and there is no room for doubt. But precisely because we want to wholeheartedly support the government and Chairman Chiang in resisting the war to the end, we must pay close attention to and severely punish the enemy's conspiracy to shake the morale of our people and the activities of traitors who act as accomplices.

Are we determined to resist the war to the end and be honorable people? Or are we willing to compromise halfway, help Japanese imperialism create 450 million 'slaves', and allow the Japanese imperialist spokesmen's rabid barking at the world to humiliate the Chinese nation to be proven in fact? This is an important crossroads that the whole country should pay attention to!

### British Scout Leader Expresses Sympathy and Wishes Victory

A letter was sent to the Municipal Boy Scout Service Corps yesterday. The letter took a month to arrive.

Mr. Bading, chairman of the British Boy Scout Association in London, sent a letter of condolence to the Boy Scouts serving in Shanghai in wartime on the first day of last month. It was received yesterday. It took exactly one month via Siberia. The original letter briefly stated, "I have learned of your letter of August 20. The British Boy Scout brothers deeply care for and admire your spirit of serving wounded compatriots and refugees. The day when your country will achieve victory and peace must not be far away. I hereby express my sincere sympathy and congratulations."

### The Ministry of Education Relieves Middle and Higher Education Students in War Zones

Appropriate subsidies are provided to schools that have moved south.

Nanjing dispatch: Students from middle and higher education institutions in the war zones of Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Pingjin, and other provinces and cities who came to Nanjing one after another have long been received and registered by the Ministry of Education and ordered to attend school, receive training, and evacuate in all directions. Approximately 900 people were issued train and boat tickets and sent to various places to study, and approximately 600 people were transferred to relevant agencies for training. Several funds were also remitted to subsidize the Shandong and Shaanxi Education Departments to handle relief matters. Recently, it was found that there are still many teachers and students from middle schools in the provinces and cities mentioned above who have arrived in Henan and Shaanxi. It is known that some schools in southern Hebei have safely transported important equipment and documents such as books and instruments to Henan. The Ministry of Education has formulated measures and allocated funds to set up one or two temporary middle schools and normal schools in Henan to accommodate the various students. In addition to sending Commissioner Cha Liangzhao to Henan to coordinate preparations, the Ministry has also telegraphed the Henan Education Department to arrange for the reception of the teachers and students first. Recently, when Yao Yinshun, Zhang Chenqing, Yang Yuru, and other principals of normal schools in Hebei reported to the Ministry, the Ministry immediately ordered them to return to Henan to participate in the work. It is also heard that the Ministry will send another commissioner to supervise the progress.

### The Truth About Qin Guoding's Beating to Death

Short Stature Led to Misidentification; Proof Documents Were Lost in Transit

The person in charge of the Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association from All Walks of Life spoke to our reporter. The association recently received a letter from the Public Works Bureau instructing it to correct the situation of Qin Guoding, a technician from the Construction Committee of the Central District of the city, being beaten to death by passers-by. The original letter briefly stated that Qin Guoding, a technician from the architect's office of the Central District Construction Committee of the city, was from Liaoning and Qingdao. He once studied architecture in Germany and returned to China. After the Northeast was occupied, he was unwilling to return to his hometown and become a compliant citizen of the occupied country. He worked in the Shanghai Central Construction Committee and contributed a lot to the construction work. Because he was deeply stimulated, he always harbored an irreconcilable hatred for the enemy. He was truly a rare and promising young man. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 29th of last month, Qin and his friend Duan were walking through the intersection of Xinzha Road and Wenzhou Road when a large crowd was gathering to watch the brave and heroic isolated army fighting in the Sihang Warehouse. Suddenly, one or two citizens mistakenly identified Qin and others as Japanese because of their short stature. Both men immediately showed their proof documents, hoping to dispel the crowd's doubts. However, because the certificate was held in hand, they were fortunately spared from being beaten. However, Qin's employee certificate, which had Qin's photo on it, was passed around for viewing and was then lost. Later, people did not ask about the situation and immediately beat him in droves. One voice led to a hundred responses, and the police were unable to stop it. In an instant, he died under the crisscrossing sticks. The situation was extremely tragic. Government authorities were extremely saddened after hearing the news. This kind of tragedy has been seen many times since the war of resistance. It is hoped that patriotic citizens will be more careful in the future to avoid similar unfortunate incidents. If you encounter someone who looks suspicious, you can ask the police to arrest and hand them over for legal action. Otherwise, Qin's death is a major loss to both the public and private sectors.

### Mitten Fundraising Campaign

Initiated by the Municipal Joint Comfort Committee, fundraising is underway.

The Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of Shanghai Comfort Committee for Anti-Enemy Soldiers, in view of the approaching early winter and the increasingly cold weather, and the concern of all circles in this city for the hardship of the soldiers, has collected a large number of cotton vests and sent them to the front line. However, in the future, soldiers fighting bitterly with the enemy in the bleak north wind will also need mittens very much. The committee plans to launch a mitten fundraising campaign. It is currently discussing the measures and will soon launch a general fundraising campaign among member stores, residents, citizens, and people from all walks of life in the district to meet the needs of soldiers on the front line. Other military comfort items are also being collected at the same time. The committee's office is now located at 77 Racecourse Road, telephone number 96658.

### Monastic Rescue Team Lacks Ambulances

Hoping for Donations or Loans from All Walks of Life

The Monastic Rescue Team, organized by the Shanghai Charity Organization United Disaster Relief Association's Committee for Rescuing Refugees in War Zones, has been dispatched to the front line every day to rescue the wounded under the leadership of General Captain Qu Wenliu and Deputy General Captain Hongming Dharma Master since its establishment. Under intense gunfire, the team still does not avoid hardship and ventures to the front line to rescue our loyal and brave wounded soldiers. Its brave service spirit has won the praise of various divisions and brigades on the front line and people from all walks of life. Since our army retreated to the new front line, the team still goes to ×× every day to rescue wounded soldiers, and the rescue work covers the entire war zone. However, because the war zone has moved backward and the road is longer, I deeply feel that the round trip takes a long time, and the prepared ambulances are not enough. I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will consider the soldiers who are fighting bravely against the enemy on the front line. If there are trucks and cars, please donate or lend them generously, so that the team can rescue as widely as possible.

### Division Commander Zhu's Injuries Have Not Yet Left Danger

One Blood Vessel in the Chest Has Already Ruptured; The Right Nervous System Has Also Been Damaged

Central News Agency reports that Division Commander Zhu Yaohua of a certain division, because of the loss of Dachang, which affected the overall situation of the Shanghai war, had no face to face his superiors and comrades, so he shot himself on the afternoon of the 28th of last month. He was immediately sent to a certain hospital in Shanghai for treatment. The Central News Agency reporter made a special trip to visit him yesterday. The details are recorded as follows:

Enduring the Pain of Abandoning After Being Breached by the Enemy

Before coming to Shanghai, Division Commander Zhu had led the unit in Jiangxi to carry out bandit suppression work, and he had repeatedly established meritorious achievements and won the praise of his superiors. This time, he was ordered to come to Shanghai to take charge of the defense line west of Dachang, and he repeatedly inflicted heavy damage on the invading enemy army. Since the enemy adopted the strategy of breaking through the center, the division became the main force in the frontal battle, resisting desperately and holding on to the original position. On the 25th of last month, the enemy attacked again with a large force, and the division still resisted desperately, but in the end, because the equipment was too poor, it was breached by the enemy army, which led to the impact on the overall situation in Shanghai. He had no choice but to endure the pain and abandon even Jiangwan and Zhabei.

Shooting Himself and Being Sent to the Hospital for Treatment

Division Commander Zhu, because the important place was lost and he had no face to face his superiors and comrades, shot himself with a pistol on the afternoon of the 18th. The bullet passed through the third and fourth ribs above the right breast, through the tip of the lung, to the back, but did not penetrate. He immediately fell to the ground. He was then helped up and it was found that there was still weak breathing in the chest. He was immediately sent to a certain hospital in Shanghai for surgery to remove the bullet. The procedure was still good, but because Division Commander Zhu was both tall and fat, there were still bone fragments embedded in the muscles, which were not easy to remove. Therefore, the wound has not healed yet. In order to prevent inflammation and lung bleeding, he is currently being injected and nursed.

Examination Shows That He Has Not Yet Left Danger

When the reporter visited Division Commander Zhu at a certain hospital yesterday, he saw that his physique was very healthy, but his spirit was quite depressed. Ge Zhiqiang, the military doctor of the division, was by his side to take care of him. According to the doctor, one blood vessel in Division Commander Zhu's chest has already ruptured. Today (the 1st), an X-ray examination was used, but the location of the rupture has not yet been found. The right nervous system has also been damaged, resulting in the complete failure of the left arm and no feeling. The examination will continue tomorrow (i.e., today). Therefore, he has not yet left the danger zone. For the sake of recuperation, he will refuse to see all guests in the future. The reporter also thought that Division Commander Zhu's life was in danger and it was not convenient to talk too much, so he said goodbye and left.

### Urgently Awaiting Donations of Cotton Vests

Cotton quilts, cotton, and first aid kits are also hoped to be generously donated.

As the weather is getting colder, many soldiers are in great need of cotton vests. The cotton vests donated by various parties that have been received by the Shanghai Municipal Comfort Committee have been claimed by various armies and are about to run out. We have no choice but to hope that all parties will continue to donate. Cotton quilts and cotton are also in great need. We also hope that first aid kits will be generously donated.

### Fierce Fighting on Both Banks of the Suzhou River: Surrounded and Suppressed Stubborn Enemies Trying to Cross Over

The remaining enemies at Wujia Shed are expected to be cleared out after our joint attack. No trace of the enemy remains in the Yaojia Zhai and Liujia Zhai areas. Over sixty enemy aircraft bombarded our positions along the river.

The focus of the Shanghai battle has shifted to both banks of the Suzhou River. The enemy is desperately trying to achieve a quick victory and has concentrated its forces for days, attempting to cross the Suzhou River in multiple routes. Aircraft and artillery bombard our riverside positions day and night. Our troops are responding calmly, still using the strategy of encirclement to annihilate the stubborn enemies trying to cross over. At dawn this morning, over sixty enemy aircraft were active along the Suzhou River west of Shanghai, dropping countless bombs. The roaring sounds shook the entire city. The sounds of artillery and machine guns were also clearly audible. The battle situation is extremely fierce. The frontline report obtained by this newspaper this afternoon is as follows: ㊀ The enemies who crossed the river near Zhongshan Road Bridge have already been completely cleared out. The enemy and we are still facing each other across the river, with fierce artillery battles on both sides. ㊁ The enemy crossed over from Chenjia Du, Jiangjia Zhai, Jinjia Zhai, etc., and fiercely attacked our Liujia Zhai position (Liujia Zhai is located between Beixin Jing and Zhoujia Bridge). Our troops were temporarily caught in a bitter battle, but reinforcements arrived in time, encircling and suppressing the enemy from three sides. Although the enemy struggled stubbornly, they completely collapsed by this morning, and the remnants fled by swimming. ㊂ The enemy crossing over from Houjia Dai was larger in number and captured our strongholds of Wujia Shed and Tingtou. After we counterattacked and retook Tingtou in the middle of the night, we formed a tight encirclement with our troops at Zhangzhai and Caijiazhai. Fierce fighting is still ongoing this afternoon, and it is expected that they will be cleared out within the day. ㊃ The enemy's heavy artillery suppression fire is still targeting Beixin Jing and Huacao Town, and was particularly fierce last night and this morning. However, the damage to our fortifications is minimal. ㊄ Our front lines from north of Jiangqiao Town to Xiaonanxiang, Guangfu, and Shixianggong Temple stand firm as a mountain. The enemy did not dare to try lightly this morning, except for artillery bombardment. ㊅ Enemy aircraft constantly scouted over Pudong this morning and dropped bombs aimlessly. Several civilian houses caught fire, but it had absolutely no impact on our military affairs.

### Enemy Troops Crossing the River at Tingtou and Liujiazhai Have Been Eliminated

A small number of remaining enemies at Wujia Shed are surrounded. The line at Xiaonanxiang and Guangfu is relatively quiet. Artillery battles along the river remain fierce.

For three days, enemy troops on the north bank of the Suzhou River have repeatedly tried to cross over, attempting to invade our south bank positions. Several points along the coast from Zhoujia Bridge through Beixin Jing to Yaojia Du at Shenji Bangkou have been crossed over. After being severely attacked by us, the two places, Zhoujia Bridge and Beixin Jing, have been almost completely annihilated. Only a very small number of remaining enemies in the Zhoujia Bridge area are entrenched north of Hopeland Road, near Liujiazhai. Yesterday morning, the remaining enemies once tried to break through to the east, rushing near the Toyota Yarn Factory. They were swept by our army with dense machine gun fire, resulting in many casualties. They then retreated back along the river to Liujiazhai. Last night, in order to clear them out, our army tightly surrounded the Liujiazhai area and searched it thoroughly. Although the enemy resisted stubbornly and many were killed, the rest fell into the water and fled. According to reports from the front, the enemy troops crossing the river in the Zhoujia Bridge and Liujiazhai areas have been completely cleared out this morning. There is also no trace of the enemy near the Toyota Yarn Factory, which is guarded by our army.

Yesterday, the enemy who crossed over to the south of the river from Houjia Dai, northwest of Beixin Jing, and Chenjia Du, Shenji Bangkou, occupied the two villages of Wujia Shed and Tingtou on the south bank under the cover of artillery fire as strongholds, attempting to advance southward. The artillery fire continued all day, bombarding our positions. Although the weather was extremely gloomy and cloudy and the air pressure was very low, enemy aircraft were still active at altitudes of over one thousand meters. Our troops responded calmly, monitoring them closely. In the evening, they advanced to suppress and severely attack them. Our artillery teams concentrated their bombardment on the river bank, and machine gun teams targeted Tingtou and Wujia Shed, advancing forward. The forward sentries crawled forward like snakes and threw grenades fiercely. Throughout the night there was artillery fire and infantry charges with close combat. Last night at midnight, the enemy at Tingtou was completely eliminated, and they were driven back, fleeing into the water. The enemy hiding in Wujia Shed was tightly surrounded by our army and will be resolved soon.

This morning, the enemy's artillery fire is still concentrated on our positions along the river. A large number of enemy aircraft are active in the hazy air, scouting and bombing. Our positions have not changed at all.

North of Shenji Bang, from Jiangqiao Town to Xiaonanxiang Guangfu, the enemy troops have repeatedly attacked but have been repelled. The line was relatively quiet this morning.

A Central News Agency correspondent accompanying the army reported at 12:00 noon on the 2nd that the sound of artillery fire on both banks of the Suzhou River west of Shanghai has continued for over fifty hours. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy attempted to cross the river for the second time, and after our interception, fierce fighting continued until dawn today. Most of the enemy in the Liujiazhai area has been annihilated, and the remaining ugly elements, having no foothold, stealthily retreated at dawn, so there is no trace of the enemy there. The ones who crossed over at Houjia Dai were forced westward by our pressure, and there are still over a hundred people surrounded by us in the civilian houses of Wujia Ku. The enemy's retreat route has been cut off, so they are still stubbornly resisting. Because the enemy has suffered heavy losses from repeated attempts to cross the river in the past two days, they have been using artillery to bombard the entire line from Zhongshan Road to Shenji Bang on the south bank since last night. The roaring sound continued throughout the night. After dawn today, several enemy aircraft bombed in support, and our army also returned fire with artillery. The sound of artillery had not stopped by noon.

A Central News Agency correspondent accompanying the army reported at 12:30 PM on the 2nd that at about 2:00 AM this morning, about 300 enemy soldiers used smoke screens to cover their attempt to cross the river from the Chenjia Du area. Our army advanced from Liujiazhai, approaching the shore and swept machine guns into the smoke. Only a few landed on the south bank, but after being surrounded in three places, they were completely annihilated by 4:30 AM. The enemy deaths reached more than 130.

### Enemy Attempt to Land in Pudong Failed

Driven away in panic after being severely attacked by us

Military news: At about 7:00 AM this morning, enemy warships in the Huangpu River once again shelled Pudong, attempting to cover the landing of enemy troops in the Chunjiang Wharf area. However, our army was fully prepared. When the enemy approached, they immediately fired with machine guns. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, the enemy troops fled in panic, and the enemy's attempt ultimately failed to be implemented.

At 9:30 this morning, when enemy aircraft were scouting and bombing in Pudong, enemy warships in the Huangpu River frequently shelled, creating a tense situation for a while after their joint sea-air operation. Our entire line issued orders to be on high alert. The enemy warships fired a total of over twenty shells and then fell silent again. The reporter later visited an officer. According to him, there is absolutely no danger to the Pudong positions. There are enemy small motorboats carrying soldiers in the Huangpu River, traveling back and forth between Hongkou and Yangshupu, but it is purely patrolling in nature and they have never dared to take any active action. Moreover, our defensive lines are solid and the guards are tight. Enemy boats cannot easily approach the shore, let alone land. In short, the stability of the entire Pudong line is as usual.

### Enemy Aircraft Indiscriminately Bombarded Western Shanghai and Pudong This Morning

Aircraft from Nanshi flew to scout but did not drop bombs. Disappeared in the afternoon due to heavy rain.

Starting at dawn this morning, large numbers of enemy giant aircraft were active in the sky, flying to western Shanghai along the Suzhou River and various places in Pudong, wantonly bombing. At around 10:00 AM, the sky suddenly became overcast and rainy, and enemy aircraft gradually decreased. However, even though it was raining heavily after 1:00 PM, there were still one or two enemy aircraft continuing to wreak havoc in the Pudong area. By 1:30 PM, enemy aircraft had disappeared. As for the Nanshi area, although a few enemy aircraft flew to scout, they did not drop any bombs.

West of Shanghai: Large teams of enemy aircraft wantonly bombed the area west of Shanghai starting at dawn this morning, dropping two or three bombs each time, or seven or eight bombs at most. The roaring sound shook the entire Shanghai area. They had not left by 1:00 PM this afternoon. The losses are under investigation. Starting at 6:00 AM this morning, six enemy aircraft scouted back and forth over the areas of Lujiadu, Yangjiadu, Zhangjiabang, Tangqiao, and Yangjing in Pudong. At around 8:00 AM, they dropped more than twenty bombs in Lujiadu and Yangjiadu successively, and frequently strafed with machine guns at low altitude, destroying more than ten civilian houses and killing and injuring many residents. They escaped at around 10:00 AM, and three more aircraft returned to drop bombs in the afternoon.

Nanshi: At around 5:00 AM this morning, there was first one aircraft, then it increased to three aircraft, and by 8:00 AM, it had increased to six aircraft, constantly circling and scouting over the areas of the railway station, Gaochangmiao, the city, and the 16 Ponds, but did not drop any bombs. Before long, they fled south. However, because the enemy had threatened two days ago to bomb Nanshi, residents have been flocking to the concessions in recent days. The area where the Chinese and foreign concessions meet was still extremely crowded with vehicles today. At noon, an enemy aircraft flew to Longhua and dropped six bombs, injuring four civilians.

Pudong: Pudong was again subjected to heavy bombing by enemy aircraft this morning. When it was not yet dawn at 5:00 AM, there were already three enemy aircraft flying over the sky. Residents were all awakened by the creaking sound of the aircraft. Seeing the lights on the enemy aircraft flickering on and off, they flew away half an hour later. At 8:30 AM, three more bombers came to scout along the coast and circled several times, before heading to the eastern villages and dropping bombs continuously. Seven bombs were dropped in Qianjia Lane, destroying four civilian houses and killing one girl. Eight bombs were dropped in Yinshici Yangdian, destroying fifteen civilian houses. Two bombs were dropped at Caotou An, destroying three civilian houses. Three bombs were dropped on Shenjia Street, two on Erluo Street, and no damage was done to Yiluo Street, destroying one civilian house and crushing an old woman to death. Two bombs were dropped on Zhangjia Building, with no deaths or injuries. Also, yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, enemy aircraft dropped one bomb in Xiaopudong, injuring Wu Zhang's wife. One bomb was dropped in Tiandu Nei, destroying one house and injuring Sheng Yugen. Three bombs were dropped in Shenjia Nong, destroying five civilian houses, killing one man, and injuring residents Wang Zhukun and Shen Chao Fa. One bomb was dropped in Shiba Jian, destroying one house and injuring Fan Xiuqing.

### Relief Society's Municipal Branch Sends Representatives to Pay Condolences to Martyred British Soldiers

The society also expressed its gratitude to the British army for assisting in rescuing refugees, and sent a formal letter of thanks to the army commander yesterday.

During the recent change in the defense line of our army in Zhabei, the war extended to western Shanghai, and as a result, the British military camp in the area was also subjected to indiscriminate shelling by the Japanese side, killing three people. Their bodies have been placed in coffins at the International Funeral Home. Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, a memorial service was held at the funeral home. All sectors of society in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, deeply regretted their unfortunate deaths because the British army maintained order and rescued refugees with utmost courage. They sent condolences one after another. The Municipal Relief Society also specially dispatched Secretary-General Mao Yun and Reception Group Director Cai Renbao as representatives of the society and the 100,000 refugees in the city to pay condolences and make every effort. They specially sent a letter of thanks yesterday: "During this time when our army changed its defense line in Zhabei, tens of thousands of our compatriots in the area were in danger and rushed out of danger. Under the fierce shelling of enemy artillery, their lives were at risk. Fortunately, your army provided full assistance and rescued them to a safe area, especially assisting the elderly, weak, women, and children. This moral spirit full of human sympathy and enthusiastic courage is not only the glory of your army, but also a great manifestation of the national civilization of your country. Our compatriots in the enemy country are all deeply grateful and will always remember it. Our association is in charge of relief, and after witnessing it, we are even more grateful. We hereby send a formal letter of thanks, hoping that your army commander will take note of it and forward it to all your colleagues in the army."

### French Catholic Churches Oppose Bombing

Requests that the government lodge a protest

Shen Shi News Agency reports that since the enemy army authorities threatened the residents of Nanshi, saying they would carry out a large-scale bombing, the residents there have been fleeing for safety, and the scene is extremely tragic. Due to the rain in recent days, no enemy aircraft have gone to carry out the bombing. However, according to reporters, Catholic and Christian churches have a large number of properties in the Nanshi urban area, accounting for more than one-third of all properties. Among them, French Catholic churches occupy the most. Therefore, all the churches are very angry now, believing that Nanshi is not a strategic point in the war, but the Japanese army intends to indiscriminately carry out bombing, harming civilians and private property, which is an act of violence unrelated to combat and is not permitted by international law. Therefore, they have requested their national government to lodge a protest with the Japanese authorities to oppose the bombing of Nanshi, so as to avoid endangering foreign properties.

### A Tour of Nanshi

Residents flee to the concessions, shops still operate as usual, and the Citizens' Corps maintains order

Since the enemy announced the bombing of Nanshi, yesterday was sunny, and two enemy aircraft flew over Nanshi. At 4:00 PM, three enemy aircraft dropped bombs on Xinma Road in the Yangjiadu area of Pudong. Their circling range extended to the eastern half of the city, so residents of Nanshi hired vehicles to move to the concessions. Vehicle prices soared several times. However, the number of people entering Nanshi recently is no less than 100,000, and the iron gates leading to the French Concession are only at four locations: Fenglin Bridge in western Shanghai, and Niaolang Road in Xieqiao, Nanyang Bridge in Ximen, and the Old North Gate. The traffic is only through the two iron gates. Although the French Concession authorities attach importance to humanitarianism and do not require passes, the entrance and exit are too small, and the refugees are more numerous, so order is inevitably disrupted. Therefore, the patrols at the iron gate ordered the guards to let a large number of people enter at a time, so the lines near the entrance were almost half a li long. Among them, the Nanyang Bridge and Old North Gate were the most crowded. The Nanyang Bridge section stretched from both the Old West Gate and Fangbang Bridge to Nanyang Bridge, with vehicles connected and sometimes stopping, with as many as several thousand vehicles. The Old North Gate along Mingguo Road was also blocked by vehicles starting from the New North Gate. Therefore, in the afternoon from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, in order to maintain order, pedestrians exiting the iron gate were temporarily held for half an hour. Then, one iron gate was opened at Nanyang Bridge to let the people exiting the iron gate out, so as to avoid blocking both sides. However, some returning women hired vehicles to enter the iron gate at 3:00 PM and waited at the end of the line, but they could not squeeze in until the evening, and the curfew time had arrived, so they had to return home in the same vehicle, and the loss was already irreparable. As for the houses along the road where the Chinese and French borders meet along Mingguo Road and Lanweiman Road, all front and back doors were nailed shut by the police authorities because some people had false passes and sought profit. However, after the relocation in these two days, this morning the reporter investigated inside and outside the city and along the Pudong area. All shops along the roads were operating as usual. However, there were very few buyers in the small vegetable market, indicating that there were few residents. As for the government agencies, judicial agencies, such as the Shanghai Local Court, were still working as usual. There are currently 600 prisoners in the detention center, and because of the shortage of yellow millet for prisoners' food, white rice is temporarily issued. Police agencies, such as the police stations, still have police standing guard at important intersections. Other civic groups, such as citizen training and defense groups, are making efforts to maintain order along the way. Currently, almost all positions around the city of Nanshi are the responsibility of citizen training.

### Our Army Sends a Large Number of Reinforcements to Shanxi

A portion moves south from northern Shanxi to join Yangquan. The left wing of our army on the Pinghan Line is advancing towards Gaoyi.

[Nanjing] The Chinese military authorities are now dispatching a large number of reinforcements to Shanxi to stop the Japanese army's offensive towards Taiyuan. According to this, a semi-official source claimed that a portion of a certain route army is now moving south from northern Shanxi to join the large army concentrated in Yangquan. The Chinese army believes that Taiyuan is related to the entire war situation in Shanxi, so the Yangquan line has decided to defend it desperately under any circumstances. The Chinese army on the Pinghan Line is also preparing to launch a large-scale counteroffensive near the Zhang River (2nd National Daily Telegram).

[Zhengzhou] Our left wing on the Pinghan Line has recovered Baixiang and is advancing towards Gaoyi. Also, four enemy aircraft bombed more than ten bombs on the Longhai Line between Haozhai and Jiaxi, killing several people.

### Short Comments

— Phase

Belgian capital telegram. According to private sources, Japan intends to accept the United States to serve as a mediator to resolve the Far East situation. However, the Chinese government must first agree to direct negotiations with Japan. This kind of news is somewhat ridiculous. Because direct negotiations between China and Japan failed, there was an undeclared war. Now that the war has been fought for eighty days, direct negotiations are still being held, then the various sacrifices of the undeclared war in the eighty days are meaningless. This is ridiculous. First, our country's resistance war has long been determined. If we don't fight, it's over. If we fight, there is no reason to stop halfway. Then, when the League of Nations meeting was held, our country had reasons to state and requested the League of Nations to make a public judgment. This is indeed an expression that our member states should have. The League of Nations could not solve it, so there was a proposal to convene a Nine-Power Treaty meeting. Now that the general meeting is about to open, and still returns to direct negotiations, then the act of convening the Nine-Power Treaty meeting is really superfluous. This is ridiculous. Second, and Japan accepts the United States to serve as a mediator, which means that the United States is responsible for mediating. Now that our government wants to approve direct negotiations with Japan, Japan's acceptance of the United States to serve as a mediator is a great mockery of the world.

### Nine-Power Conference to Open Tomorrow Amidst Brutal Japanese Aggression

Delegations from all countries gather in the Belgian capital. Chinese students in Europe demand sanctions against Japan. British political circles express pessimism about the future of the conference.

Belgian capital: The Chinese delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference arrived here this afternoon. The chief representative is Gu Weijun, the ambassador to France, and the vice-chief representatives are Guo Taiqi, the ambassador to the United Kingdom, and Qian Tai, the ambassador to Belgium.

During the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Yang will specialize in the intelligence work of the Chinese delegation (1st Central News Agency Havas Telegram).

⊙Brussels: On the eve of the opening of the Beijing Conference today, student groups here issued an appeal, asking the delegations attending the meeting to do their best to help China and sanction Japan. The declaration also listed the Japanese army's atrocities of destroying Chinese universities and bombing undefended cities (2nd Haitian Telegram).

⊙Beijing: British Foreign Secretary Eden left London last night to come to Beijing, accompanied by Colonial Minister Malcolm MacDonald and Undersecretary of the Foreign Office, Cadogan. Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov and Deputy Minister Bodankin also set off from Moscow on Sunday to come here.

[London] There is great concern here about the situation in the Far East. Political figures are very pessimistic about the prospects of the Beijing Conference. Especially with Japan's refusal to attend, they are extremely disappointed. It is said that since the method of economic joint sanctions has been decided not to be adopted, the only possibility for the meeting is to first call on the belligerents to mediate, and second to obtain the understanding of all countries on the attitude of the final result, so as to decide on the steps to be taken to end the war. It is believed that the future of the conference depends largely on the cooperation of the joint actions of Britain and the United States, and it is expected that the US representative Davis has received detailed instructions on this matter. The Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's suspension of Brussels has also increased the pessimism here (1st Haitian News Agency Telegram).

### The Japanese Government Organizes a Wartime General Headquarters

Major Personnel Changes in the Army; Hata and Koiso Promoted to Generals

[Tokyo] Amidst the development of the Sino-Japanese war, important opinions have arisen within the Japanese government. There is a proposal to establish a wartime general headquarters to achieve the objectives of the China Incident as soon as possible and to ensure that no regrets are left in managing the war. Prime Minister Konoe has been seeking opinions from various sectors, primarily the army and navy. As a result, all parties have unanimously agreed to this plan. Therefore, the government has decided to apply the wartime general headquarters ordinance, which was promulgated during the Russo-Japanese War, and establish a general headquarters in Tokyo. This will realize a wartime system that is both in name and in substance. The timing will be determined after considering the development of the war situation in the Shanghai area and the attitudes of various countries at the Nine-Power Conference. It is expected to be around mid-November. The staff of the general headquarters will likely be composed of the Chief and Vice Chief of the General Staff, the Chief and Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff, the Army and Navy Ministers, and the Prime Minister. (2nd United Press Telegram)

Tokyo: Major personnel changes and promotions are expected in the Japanese Army. Hata Shunroku, the Inspector General of Military Education, and Koiso Kuniaki, the Commander of the Korean Army, will be promoted from lieutenant general to general. (1st Domei News Agency)

### Developing Inland Finance Issues

— Mu Shensi

Our nation's financial system is chaotic and fragmented. The finance in the metropolitan areas and inland areas have not only failed to achieve balanced development, but have even formed a contrast of prosperity versus decline. This has already significantly impacted the national economy and people's livelihoods in peacetime. All the more so now, during this period of war, this is felt even more acutely. Therefore, there is an urgent need to seek to develop inland finance. Let us take a few examples to illustrate this. This year, the rural areas have reported bumper harvests, which could have been used to supplement military and civilian food supplies and consolidate the economic strength of the vast majority of the population. This was originally good news amidst the war of resistance. However, due to the war, there is a lack of buyers for cotton in various regions, and prices have plummeted to unprecedented lows. With the new harvest now appearing, if no remedies are sought, it may lead to a disastrous outcome despite the bumper harvest. This is one example. The movement of factories inland has long attracted the attention of the general public and has already entered the stage of implementation. On the one hand, this effort strives to produce for national defense and civilian industries; on the other hand, it maintains the livelihoods of tens of thousands of workers. This is an important issue in the war of resistance. However, financial institutions are needed to provide assistance at any time and in any place. Especially under the current circumstances of the enemy's illegal blockade of the coast, this is an excellent opportunity to actively promote domestic goods and establish a strong foundation. This is a second example. The incomplete and unsound organization of inland finance in our country is of utmost importance to the promotion of the national economy and the facilitation of national finance. As evidence, the current issue of 500 million yuan in national salvation bonds, in proportion to the population, is actually not a large amount. However, after only two months, subscriptions are still insufficient. One cannot ignore that the reason for the slow subscription is that there is no way to universally mobilize subscriptions in the inland areas, and many inland compatriots have not had the opportunity to subscribe according to their capacity. Furthermore, for the sake of a prolonged war of resistance, not only should we ensure that the current national bonds are fully subscribed as soon as possible, but we should also prepare for the issuance of second and third rounds of national bonds. This is a third example.

At the beginning of the Battle of Shanghai, the Ministry of Finance promulgated seven measures to stabilize finance, on the one hand to stabilize domestic finance, and on the other hand to prevent capital outflow. The Central Bank, along with the four agricultural banks, jointly established an inland financial development committee to invigorate inland finance and consolidate the national economy. The intention of the financial authorities was extremely thorough. However, because the 'Inland Financial Development Committee' was only distributed in a small number of important cities, the quantity seemed insufficient. As for the measures to stabilize finance, because they were temporary and emergency measures, it was inevitable that they would focus on one aspect while neglecting others. As a result, urban capital failed to flow smoothly to the inland areas, and inland finance also failed to circulate actively. In view of the above-mentioned shortcomings, I would like to offer four points on the essence of developing inland finance:

① Encourage inland remittances: All Shanghai remittance deposits should be allowed to freely remit into the inland areas and paid in legal tender. If remittances are made from the inland areas to Shanghai, they should be paid in remittances. However, in the event of an impractical need, a request may be submitted stating the reasons and requesting approval to pay in legal tender. Furthermore, the carrying of legal tender to Shanghai should be regulated, with a certain amount or more being prohibited and confiscated to prevent capital outflow.

② Open inland deposits: All inland deposits should be freely deposited and withdrawn without restrictions. Deposits require deposits to be made and taken out. If one cannot smoothly take out, one cannot smoothly deposit. Furthermore, Shanghai's fixed-term and current deposits, transferred to the original bank in the inland areas, should be given preferential treatment by exempting remittance fees to encourage them to enrich the economic strength of the rear areas.

③ Establish more inland banks: Banks in our country are not only concentrated in cities, but also set up branch offices in one corner. Now, branch offices or sub-branches should be established in towns and cities in all provinces, expanded where they have been established, and newly established where they have not been established. The original financial organizations in various regions should be supported and improved, and in nearby rural areas, the organization of 'credit cooperatives' should be utilized, subsidized where they exist, and promoted where they do not. Furthermore, one should deeply understand that the principle of management lies in the spirit of division of labor and cooperation. Therefore, one should no longer focus on one corner and engage in unnecessary competition. One must strive to improve the financial organizations in various regions and give full play to their inherent strengths, so as to complete a great national financial network.

④ Expand postal savings services: It is not easy to practically establish branch offices of banks in various places in a short period of time. However, the establishment of post offices is already widespread throughout the country and penetrates into rural areas. Therefore, depending on the situation in various places and the size of the post office, they can undertake all or part of the banking business. On the one hand, they can boldly absorb social idle funds; on the other hand, they can supply funds for enterprises. They can also use the method of import and export of goods to facilitate the financing of transportation and sales. In this way, not only can manpower be saved, but efficiency can also be quickly improved.

If the above-mentioned points are implemented separately and promoted vigorously, urban capital can flow smoothly to the inland areas, and the financial function of the inland areas can also be fully developed. The benefits are at least the following: Centralize inland cash reserves, complete legal tender policy, and enrich national wealth; this is one benefit. Promote agricultural, industrial, and mining production, develop natural resources, and enhance the power of resistance; this is a second benefit. Utilize the cooperative financial function, improve the organization of the people, and consolidate order in the rear areas; this is a third benefit. In terms of our country's vast territory, abundant resources, and large population, if the economy is properly managed, then the final victory of the war of resistance will definitely belong to us. In recent years, government departments have spared no effort in promoting the 'National Economic Construction Movement'. I would like to suggest that scholars also use the slogan 'Funds Return to the Countryside'. However, under today's economic circumstances, effective measures must be taken to save the nation from danger. I once recalled that during the European War, the German Minister of Economic Affairs, Helfferich, said, "It must be known that once the national economy falls into stagnation or collapse, the foundation of the country's resistance will immediately be shaken, and it will fall into an irreversible situation." How apt are these words! I hope that the financial community of our country, under the leadership of the financial authorities, will rise up and make plans for this.

### Tragedy of Enemy Bombing in Changshu

Over a Hundred Houses Destroyed in the West Warehouse Area; Rear of the County High School Completely Destroyed

Changshu Correspondence: At 2:30 PM on the 28th, the urban area was again bombed by enemy planes, with up to twenty bombs dropped. The local losses were very serious. The details are as follows:

At about 1:30 PM on that day, the urban area issued an emergency alarm. After a while, six enemy planes came from the southwest. The planes were old-style biplanes. Judging from their direction and time, it seemed that they came to Changshu after their atrocities over Wuxi. When they reached the sky over the urban area, they first circled the city from north to west. Then they began to drop bombs. From 2:35 to 2:57 PM, they went southeast. The bombing lasted for a total of twenty-two minutes. More than twenty bombs were dropped, all falling on the civilian houses in the West Warehouse area, destroying about one hundred houses. At 5:15 PM, the alarm was lifted. Senli High School, seeing the danger in the city, had already sent students to Wangzhuang Town for classes. This time, the enemy planes targeted the school, with four bombs hitting the school. Three bombs fell on the open space of the large playground, leaving three large holes, each about the size of a square table and about three feet deep. One bomb hit the auditorium, completely destroying the girls' dormitory, girls' church, auditorium, teachers' office, principal's office, secretary's office, library, and part of the classrooms in the rear half. The doors and windows on the half of the building along the playground were all damaged and in disarray. Many fragments of bombs were found there, with the words "60 Watt Explosion Bomb" on them. The doors and windows of the front half of the building, such as the boys' dormitory, teachers' bedrooms, classrooms, and Boy Scout office, were also destroyed. Pieces of broken glass were scattered all over the ground. Only one watchman was staying in the school, so he was naturally injured. The most significant losses this time were the school and the Shanghai Guanxi Church at the western end. There were more than twenty casualties.

### City Federation Presents Banners to Soldiers to Express Respect

The Municipal First Special District Citizens' Federation, in order to express its gratitude and appreciation for the loyalty and bravery of the frontline soldiers in fighting against the war, which has benefited the country, has specially made four red silk banners, embroidered on all four sides, with words of vigilance woven from black velvet in the center. The words are, 'Drums and trumpets should be majestic', 'Swallowing the fierce sun', 'Protecting the country as a city', 'Cutting the thorns for the country', 'National Glory'. The upper inscription is 'To the entire soldiers of a certain army and a certain division' or 'Respectfully presented to a certain general'. The lower inscription is 'Respectfully presented jointly by the chairman and all standing committee members'. It is reported that the Federation has decided to send representatives to present the banners to various armies.

### Traffic Completely Restored South of Garbage Bridge

People and Vehicles Can Pass Through South Suzhou Road; Trolleybuses Extend Northward

Traffic on the southern section of the New Garbage Bridge, since being blockaded on the afternoon of the 27th of last month, and the concession authorities placing wire and wooden frames across the northern end of Nicheng Bridge to prohibit people from passing east, was opened with a gap in the middle of the wire and wooden frames on the morning of the 31st of last month, allowing pedestrians to enter and exit through the gap, restoring traffic between Nicheng Bridge and Xiamen Road. However, vehicles were still prohibited from passing through. As of this morning (2nd), the concession authorities have widened the gap in the wire and wooden frames placed on Nicheng Bridge, with the distance between the two ends of the remaining space being more than 20 feet. Therefore, pedestrians and vehicles are allowed to pass through from Nicheng Bridge to the South Suzhou River bank. The terminus of the 18th route trolleybus has also been extended to the New Garbage Bridge pier.

### Banks and Money Shops Implement Economic Severance Against Japan

Central Bank Suspends Trading in Japanese Exchange Rates; Refuses to Accept Japanese Bank Drafts and Checks

After the Banking and Money Shop Association issued a notice implementing economic severance against Japan, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Banking and Money Shop Association that: ① Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, banks have automatically stopped all transactions with Japanese commercial banks. At the same time, the Central Bank has suspended the listing and trading of Japanese exchange rates. ② Money shops have never had direct transactions with Japanese commercial banks. Now, Japanese commercial banks' drafts, checks, etc., have been uniformly refused. Furthermore, the Japanese commercial banks in Shanghai are Yokohama Specie Bank, Mitsui Bank, Mitsubishi Bank, Bank of Taiwan, Sumitomo Bank, Bank of Korea, Shanghai Bank, and Hankou Bank. Their Chinese employees have already resigned voluntarily. As for the banknotes of Japanese commercial banks, they have long been rejected in our country's market.

### Banking and Money Shop Industry Develops Internal Remittances and Loans to Purchase Agricultural Products

Due to the fact that various important industries have been moved to the interior to start operations, and people from all provinces and cities in Shanghai have also returned to their hometowns to seek a livelihood, the internal remittance business of the banking and money shop industry in the city has suddenly become active due to the influx of funds into the interior. All banks and shops are planning to set up branches and offices in the interior to meet the needs. In addition, this year the climate is suitable, and rainfall is well-distributed, and there has been a bumper harvest of agricultural products in various places. However, due to enemy planes bombing everywhere, those who purchase agricultural products such as cotton are not as enthusiastic as in the past. Now, in order to regulate the rural economy and facilitate the flow of food and daily necessities, it has been decided that each of the inland branches and shops should prepare a certain amount of loans to support industry, commerce, and farmers in purchasing agricultural products. According to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau are currently processing loans in various places according to the planned plans. The Agricultural Credit Administration is actively preparing for agricultural warehouse loans, marketing loans, and agricultural product pledges, and is preparing to collect a large amount of agricultural products to meet the needs of a long-term war of resistance.

### Trade Unions Need to Emphasize Propaganda Work for National Salvation

The Trade Union Association for National Salvation, in order to expand the propaganda for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and the Defend Greater Shanghai Movement, has specially dispatched more than 300 propaganda teams today to conduct propaganda on various roads, and carry a large number of propaganda materials, slogans, etc. in order to distribute and post them, so as to awaken the citizens of the whole city and strengthen the work of national salvation. The fourth issue of the Association's National Salvation Journal was also published today. In order to grasp the current situation, its content also focuses on defending Greater Shanghai. In addition, when conducting the burial service for the English soldier, the association also sent a representative to participate in the funeral and presented a wreath to express condolences.

### The Task of Intellectual Youth Today

"Who is the new force of China? Only we youth!

Who is the transformer of the world? Only we youth!

Full of spirit, healthy body, passionate emotions, firm will,

Aspiring and promising without limit, only we youth!"

Youth Song, taken from the Military Songs Collection

Since the "July 8th" and "August 13th" incidents occurred, our government decided to launch a full-scale war of resistance against Japan. Therefore, in South China and North China, we have armed youth who are giving full play to their full spirit, strong physique, passionate emotions, and firm will, and are fighting for the survival of the nation every day. But what about intellectual youth?

Most of the intellectual youth are college and middle school students and primary school teachers. The former number no less than 600,000, and the latter number no less than 500,000. These millions of intellectual youth also have a full spirit, a strong physique, passionate emotions, and a firm will, and also have rich knowledge. They can certainly exert unlimited power for the nation. However, in fact, what is currently being demonstrated is only very small efforts such as fundraising, condolences, and running wall newspapers.

I don't want intellectual youth to all arm themselves and go to the front line, because this is not necessary at the moment, and it is a great loss to the nation to let the outstanding members of the country only exert the effectiveness of a soldier. I definitely don't want them to do that.

We have now lost a part of the Great Wall on the national defense line, but the loyal and brave armed youth have already created a wall of flesh and blood on the front line for the country. We also hope that intellectual youth can create a spiritual Great Wall in the rear.

What is the spiritual Great Wall? Organized and trained people will be our greatest force in the war of resistance in the future, and will write our most enduring force in the war of resistance in the future. Therefore, the spiritual Great Wall that we hope to create is to create these organized and trained people.

Today's Northeasterners are even willing to be pioneers for the enemy. This is the reason why our spiritual Great Wall has not been completed.

Today's Beiping has a seminar for primary and secondary school teachers, with the purposes of "good neighborliness" and "anti-Party rule." This is the reason why our spiritual Great Wall has never been completed.

Along the Jinghu Road and Huhang Road today, there are often traitors found. Some of them are willing to be traitors for a few dimes of living expenses, and some even do not know that they have become traitors. This is also the reason why our spiritual Great Wall has not been completed.

We can no longer delay building this spiritual Great Wall. We hope that these millions of intellectual youth will quickly undertake this great project!

Organizing the people should start with the organization of intellectual youth themselves. Training the people should start with the training of intellectual youth themselves. At present, many colleges and middle schools in the war zone have suspended classes, and even in non-war zones, there are schools that have suspended classes due to continuous enemy bombings. Especially in Shanghai, there are a large number of intellectual youth who have fled from Tianjin. These out-of-school college and middle school students and unemployed primary school teachers can receive short-term necessary training under the guidance of government agencies or anti-enemy support associations and other groups, and form simple and practical organizations in groups of five or ten. Then, going deep into the interior, even deeper into the countryside, they can organize and train the vast masses of people.

For the organization of the people, we can use the existing organizations such as Baojia, but we must make them sound, upright and practical.

For the training of the people, in addition to teaching wartime common sense, national geography, international situation, etc., we should also pay more attention to the four virtues of etiquette, justice, integrity, and shame to cultivate noble integrity.

As for the college and middle school students and primary school teachers who are not currently suspended or will soon attend classes, they should also allocate a portion of their time to do this work. However, it can be limited to the local area. For this major work, our national Boy Scouts should exert a greater force than they have exerted in the past!

Finally, I would like to offer a passage from a reporter from the Ta Wan Pao as a warning to the youth of our country:

"If the Chinese people all embrace the determination to coexist with the country or perish with the country, even if the political power of China in the area where I live is blocked by the enemy in the future, I will still fight for the country, not abandon it because of hardship, and not shrink back because of violence, then even if the cavalry tramples all over China, China will still be united and survive. Our final victory depends on this... It is of course important to use artillery to resist the enemy's invasion, but after the artillery resistance fails, our only Great Wall is the united hearts of the people."
