### Fierce Nighttime Artillery Battle in Pudong

Enemy troops attempted landings but were all repelled. The 8th Regiment fought hand-to-hand, resulting in heavy enemy casualties. Our forces in eastern Shanghai continue to advance towards the concessions.

Yesterday, our troops held the advantage on all fronts, and the enemy's base of operations continued to shrink. On the eastern front, the enemy retreated entirely into the concessions, putting up a desperate resistance. On the northern front, after our troops captured the Japanese Elementary School, the enemy launched a full-scale counterattack from the morning before yesterday until 1 PM yesterday, resulting in extremely fierce fighting. The struggle for the Eight Character Bridge saw back-and-forth advances and retreats as many as five times. Our troops bravely fought, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, who ultimately collapsed and retreated. The enemy is now relying on the special and sturdy fortifications of their defensive works, digging in and holding out. Our troops are also adopting a method of gradual advance, targeting the enemy's weaknesses, and the day of a complete resolution should not be far off. In Pudong last night, our troops ordered an artillery barrage, which the enemy ships returned. Multiple enemy aircraft provided cover for troops attempting to land. For a time, artillery fire and machine gun fire were dense, and the fierce battle continued until 4 AM this morning, when the enemy troops were all repelled. A detailed account of the battle conditions on each front is as follows:

In Pudong, a fierce artillery battle raged last night. After the enemy's attempt to use artillery fire to cover an infantry landing failed, there was another extremely intense exchange of fire yesterday morning and evening. At 11:45 PM last night, our artillery corps began operations, launching a heavy artillery barrage at the enemy ships. The artillery fire was densest at 11 PM. In Gaoqiao and Tangjiawan, the enemy used multiple aircraft in an attempt to cover a stealth landing, but they were repelled by our machine gun fire. Artillery fire resumed at 1 AM this morning. In just ten minutes, one of our shells hit an enemy ship in a vital spot. In the South City area, there were some stray bullet losses. In Pudong, a shell hit and ignited a warehouse in Lujiazui, causing a blaze that lit up the sky and filled the air with smoke. The fire is still burning this morning. The location of the fire is said to be the godown of the British American Tobacco Company and the Rihua Cotton Mill in Pudong.

Our Troops Launch Intense Artillery Barrage

Yesterday morning's battle began at 10:30 AM. Enemy planes circled our positions for a long time, conducting reconnaissance. The artillery fire from enemy ships in the Huangpu River then began, and our troops immediately returned fire. The two sides exchanged fire for about ten minutes before it subsided. At 7:45 PM, the artillery battle resumed. Our artillery corps used heavy shells to bombard the enemy's New Mitsui Wharf, Old Mitsui Wharf, Qichang Wharf, and the Yangshupu area. Our artillery fire was dense and accurate. The enemy ships panicked and scrambled to return fire, appearing very disoriented. The artillery fire lasted for half an hour before it subsided.

Artillery Shell Hits Enemy Ship

The enemy ships were in a state of confusion, and several enemy planes were seen taking off from the Huangpu River, circling in the blackness of the moonlit night, presumably to scout out the location of our artillery positions. They flew around several times before returning to their original positions. At 10:25 PM, the artillery battle became most intense, interspersed with extremely dense machine gun fire. Enemy ships on the river in Gaoqiao and Tangjiawan again attempted to provide cover for an infantry landing. Our troops opened fire and used machine guns to prevent them. The two sides exchanged fire for half an hour before the artillery fire subsided again. At 12:55 AM this morning, the rumbling sound resumed. The battle lasted for about ten minutes, during which a loud bang was heard, indicating that one of the enemy ships had been hit by our artillery shell.

Fire Erupts in Northeast Area

In Pudong, the British American Tobacco Company's warehouse and the Rihua Cotton Mill in Lujiazui were struck by artillery shells and caught fire, burning fiercely. Adding to the severity, the southwest wind fueled the blaze, which continued to burn until dawn. Judging by the direction of the dense smoke and fire, it was at the British American Tobacco Company's warehouse and the Rihua Cotton Mill in Lujiazui. In the South City area, there were also stray bullets that struck, one landing at Pier No. 5 and another in front of the Great Pier Fire Brigade. Only civilian houses were slightly damaged, with minimal losses.

Rumors of Four Sunken Japanese Ships

According to the Central News Agency, the enemy ships in the Huangpu River have suffered significant losses from repeated bombardments by our artillery and aircraft. It is rumored that the enemy ship "Hishi" raised our national flag yesterday to avoid attack by our forces. Four Japanese merchant ships near the Rotten Mud Ferry in the Huangpu River were carrying out some kind of military mission. In order to obstruct enemy ship traffic, our forces sank them yesterday.

### Japanese Headquarters in Ruins

The fourth floor of the main building completely destroyed. The glass windows on each floor resemble a beehive.

(Special Dispatch from this newspaper) This newspaper's reporter visited the front lines around Eight Character Bridge yesterday afternoon around 4 PM and witnessed the sturdy fortifications our army constructed and the rapid, energetic advance, feeling extremely excited. According to a certain officer, our troops began actions at dawn on the 16th at Eight Character Bridge, launching an attack on the Japanese Elementary School. The enemy initially resisted stubbornly, but after our troops attacked from three sides, they retreated one after another, and we captured it in just one hour, seizing countless ammunition. This location is a vital point, responding to the east and west, and is extremely convenient for future operations. The enemy has been launching full-scale counterattacks since yesterday morning (i.e., the morning before yesterday), advancing and retreating five times, with extremely heavy enemy losses, ultimately failing and retreating. From that location, the reporter looked towards the headquarters of the Japanese Naval Landing Force on Jiangwan Road, which was already incomplete and ruined. The sun flag on the rooftop had long been removed. The fourth floor of the main building has become a pile of rubble due to intense bombardment from our side and is unusable, while the glass windows on each floor are completely shattered, resembling a beehive. The enemy troops who are desperately defending themselves within are using lethal weapons such as tanks and armored vehicles, going out from time to time. The defensive works around the headquarters are extremely sturdy and difficult to break through. Fortunately, our troops have gained a layered encirclement over the days, and although the enemy is stubborn, they will definitely be destroyed within days.

### Our Troops Achieve Successive Victories

Enemy's flanks to be cut off by our forces. Intense hand-to-hand combat at the front lines.

According to the Central News Agency, our troops have been achieving successive victories in the Shanghai battles for the past six days. The enemy forces have lost multiple key military strongholds and have now retreated entirely into the concession area, putting up a desperate resistance. Despite repeated reinforcements, repeated attempts to counterattack have been in vain. As of yesterday, the enemy's northernmost position was the landing force headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road, relying on its sturdy barracks for isolated and desperate struggle. After our troops captured the naval training ground, a vital point in the enemy's central sector, yesterday morning's fierce attack forced them into the concession area, cutting the enemy's lines into a right angle, and the left and right flanks will be cut off. The enemy's defensive area is now long and narrow, measuring 8,000 meters from east to west, and the widest part from north to south is North Sichuan Road, about 2,500 meters. The eastern area is 2,000 meters wide, but the narrowest point is less than 1,000 meters, so their artillery fire is no longer effective. The sound of artillery fire has been sparse for the past two days, seeming very quiet, but the hand-to-hand combat at the front lines has been very intense.

### Enemy Troops Lack Fighting Spirit

More than 2,300 killed or wounded. Our troops have only suffered 7-800 casualties.

According to the Central News Agency, a certain senior commander told reporters yesterday about the battle situation, saying that the enemy headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road was rebuilt with steel plates and concrete after the January 28th Incident, making it as strong as a fortress. Our artillery and aircraft bombs have hit it many times, but have not been able to destroy it. However, our troops have continued to shrink the enemy's position, forming an encirclement. The enemy headquarters' connection with the rear is threatened by us. We have deployed elite artillery units to join the battle, and the stubborn remnants of the enemy can be eliminated soon. Since the outbreak of hostilities, our troops, from generals to soldiers, have been incredibly brave and unafraid of death. On the other hand, the enemy troops are fearful and demoralized, lacking fighting spirit. As soon as they encounter our troops' assault, they flee and collapse, relying only on tanks to resist. In total, the enemy has suffered more than 2,300 killed or wounded, while our side has only suffered 7-800 casualties.

### Our Troops are Brave and Skilled

The Shanghai Times's report can confirm the Japanese army's panicked retreat.

Yesterday, the Shanghai Times published news about the Shanghai war, titled "Chinese Army Gains Important Progress after Brave Hand-to-Hand Combat, Japanese troops in Yangshupu area forced by Chinese troops after being heavily bombarded from Jiangwan area." It continued to say that on the afternoon of the 17th, there was hand-to-hand combat throughout the Yangshupu area. The Chinese army bravely charged and penetrated the Japanese lines. The Japanese defenders were unable to assemble a defense in time and were pursued and retreated behind Taopeng Road. This line extended to Baoshan Road, and the Chinese army then rushed in from the cracks in the line. At that time, the Japanese army was in a difficult situation. The Japanese gunners were afraid that the sound of the shells would hit their own troops, so they could not fire to provide cover. Until late at night, the Chinese army was still attacking vigorously. All day, the artillery teams were almost completely silent, but the Chinese artillery team in Mouth Mouth area attacked Hongkou district but was unsuccessful. At 2 PM, the Japanese positions were bombed by Chinese aircraft, which was not contained. A big fire then broke out in the Hongkou district. The translator notes that this report in the Shanghai Times is worth noting. The bravery of our front-line soldiers in battle can be seen from this.

### Large Numbers of Japanese Residents Leave Shanghai

Part of them seek refuge at the Astor House Hotel. The hotel manager protests to the Japanese Consulate.

According to refugees who escaped from Zhaofeng Road, at 7:30 AM yesterday, two Japanese ships, the Shanghai Maru and Nagasaki Maru, arrived and docked at Huishan Wharf. More than 4,000 Japanese residents and a large number of Japanese soldiers, estimated at 400-500 dead and wounded, boarded the ships, which will return to Japan this afternoon. They also said that when the Japanese residents boarded the ship, they were all in a state of disarray, supporting the elderly and carrying children, and some even looked hungry and tearful, which was tragic.

The Shanghai Times said that many Japanese people live in the Yangshupu factory area. Because the area has become a battlefield and they cannot live in peace, an emergency committee has been established by the Japanese, and they have negotiated with the manager of the Hong Kong Shanghai Hotels Company to borrow the Astor House Hotel as their residence. About 300 family members of employees from Japanese factories on Yangshupu Road and Pingliang Road have moved in. The original guests of the hotel have all moved elsewhere. However, according to the China Press, the Hong Kong Shanghai Hotels Company's resident secretary in Shanghai, Mr. Hetzel, issued a statement saying that rumors that the Astor House Hotel was rented to the Japanese were untrue. However, Japanese refugees from the Yangshupu area had forced their way into the hotel, and a protest had been lodged with the Japanese Consul-General, who promised to persuade them to leave.

At 2:10 PM yesterday, a large truck full of Japanese women and children was escorted by US merchant marines along Nanjing Road from west to east, crossing the Bund and heading north over the Waibaidu Bridge. It was raining heavily at the time, and the truck had no rain protection equipment, so the Japanese women and children were all drenched like drowned chickens, with rain hitting their faces and makeup smeared. The batch of Japanese women and children appeared to be evacuating from the western district of the Public Concession, attempting to return to their home country.

Yongfeng Building Under Our Control

(Special Dispatch from this newspaper) A certain unit of our army attacked the Yongfeng Building on North Sichuan Road from Guangdong Street starting on the night of the 16th. As of the night before last, it was still being defended by the enemy in isolation, occupying the high ground and stubbornly resisting. The highest point of the building is an observation tower. There are not many soldiers stationed inside, but the Shanghai Grand Theater south of Yongfeng Building is equipped with two cannons and machine guns and anti-aircraft guns on the rooftop, which are aimed at us. However, our troops occupy the ground, are willing to die and will not retreat, and have the effect of being able to capture what is attacked and winning when fighting. On the evening of the 17th, the enemy used three armored vehicles to provide cover for a counterattack against us. Our troops waited for them to approach and then threw hand grenades at them. In less than five minutes, the armored vehicles were damaged and immediately turned around and retreated, speeding away. As of yesterday afternoon, Yongfeng Building and the Shanghai Grand Theater were in our army's siege, and the enemy was unable to do anything. It is expected that they will be occupied within a day or two. Once this line is captured, the enemy's only escape route is Dixiwei Road. However, half of this line is already in our hands. For example, the area around Rutheland Road and Rue Doumer is under our control. Therefore, no matter how stubbornly the enemy at the Japanese Naval Headquarters resists, once their rear route is cut off, they will be defeated without a fight.

Our Troops Occupy the Shenxin Textile Mills

According to the Central News Agency, our troops have been devoting their full strength on the eastern front for the past two days, taking advantage of their victories to advance. The enemy has suffered repeated defeats, and morale is low. Yesterday, our troops also occupied the Shenxin Textile Company's No. 5 Mill and No. 6 Mill on Huade Road. The enemy troops are now concentrated at the Electric Company's garage on Huishan Road. At 4 PM, our troops attacked from Dalianwan Road, engaging in fierce street fighting at the intersection of Huade Road. We used small steel cannons to assist in the battle, creating a very strong momentum.

Our Troops in Eastern Shanghai Advance to Kangyuan Factory

(Special Dispatch from this newspaper) A certain unit of our troops in eastern Shanghai advanced to the vicinity of Huade Road the night before last. There was no major progress yesterday morning. However, around 3-4 PM, our troops launched a sudden and fierce attack, like a force breaking through bamboo. The enemy troops were very disoriented. As of 10 PM last night, the Kangyuan Cannery was full of our troops, who were currently searching the area. Our troops in eastern Shanghai are achieving successive victories, fiercely attacking the enemy troops. Artillery fire is intense in the Yangshupu, Huishan Road, and Dixiwei Road areas. The police officers of the local police station are working under a hail of bullets every day. The police stations at Foolad Road, Kanyu Road, and Huishan, have been evacuated. Yesterday, the Yulin Road and Yangshupu police stations were also evacuated yesterday morning because our troops were advancing in successive victories and the intercepted shells and artillery fire were too intense. The Yulin Road police station has been taken over by our troops. In total, five police stations have been evacuated in the eastern district.

When the Yulin Road police station was evacuated yesterday, it was immediately occupied by a certain regiment of our troops. At that time, the regiment commander stated that he would be responsible for protecting the property and valuables of the police station. When the Chinese police officers saw our heroic soldiers, they were excited and prepared tea and water for them. The regiment commander thanked them repeatedly, saying that the situation here was extremely dangerous and that they should retreat quickly. Protecting the country is the duty of our soldiers, and we would not dare to trouble you. We will meet again when we achieve final victory.

Quiet on the Wusong Front

Yesterday, the fighting at the Wusongkou was quiet. Our troop positions were exceptionally solid. The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company's power plant next to Jungong Road was penetrated by enemy artillery shells in more than 20 places, and the Merchant Marine School on Artillery Terrace was also damaged by artillery fire. Enemy ship artillery shells also landed in Wusong Town, Waitongtai Road, and Yanglu, causing minor damage.

French Police Refuse Japanese Ship to Dock

According to the Central News Agency, at 9:30 AM yesterday, two small Japanese gunboats carrying enemy soldiers and plainclothes officers, totaling about 200 people, sailed through the Jianghaiguan Wharf to the Huangpu River outside the Sixteenth Bund, intending to dock alongside foreign merchant ships anchored there, hoping to disembark. However, the foreign ships strictly refused. At the same time, the French police station, upon hearing the news, also sent personnel to strictly prohibit the two ships from approaching the shore. The two ships were forced to stop in the river, and after about an hour, they sailed back to the area around Huishan Wharf.

Landing Enemy Troops Occupy Factories

According to the Central News Agency, most of the enemy reinforcements landed at various wharves in Yangshupu, occupying various factories for garrison, such as the Huacheng Tobacco Company, the World Book Company Printing House, and the Tram Company Garage. According to a report this afternoon, the enemy troops in the Tram Company Garage are being redeployed in order to launch a counterattack. There will be fierce fighting tonight.

According to the Central News Agency, enemy ronin and plainclothes officers are quite active in various places. According to intelligence reports, there are plainclothes enemy soldiers in a certain building on the north side of the Waibaidu Bridge, and trucks and small cars are often filled with Japanese ronin and shameless Chinese traitors, speeding to various places to disrupt the order of our rear.

Increased Defenses Along Suzhou Creek

Our troops' resistance on all fronts is achieving successive victories. The enemy troops have now retreated to the area around Huade Road, and their positions are becoming increasingly narrow, so a resolution is not far off. This reporter made a special trip to inspect the Suzhou Creek area yesterday. All bridges along Suzhou Creek have now been taken over and guarded by British soldiers, and the defensive works have been strengthened. In addition to the Waibaidu Bridge, the Zhaopulu Bridge, and the Sichuan Road Bridge, which have all been equipped with barbed wire to cut off traffic, sandbags have been piled up on the south side of each bridge to prepare for any eventuality. Sandbags have been heightened at the entrance of the British Consulate, the entrance of the Grand Theatre, the end of the Sichuan Road Bridge, and in front of the YMCA. At the same time, barbed wire has been installed along the riverbank, from the Bund Park outside the Waibaidu Bridge to the Tianhou Palace Bridge, and security is extremely tight.

After 11 PM last night, this newspaper's reporter returned to the Bund for a patrol. There was not a single person on the road. When the car arrived at the Bund via Hankou Road and headed north past the Nanjing Road intersection, there were only three Chinese and Western police officers standing there. There were more than a dozen red lights placed on the ground at the intersection, which was also blocked with ropes, and vehicles could not pass through. Looking east into the Huangpu River, there were vaguely two warships, but all the lights were out, making it even harder to tell which country they belonged to. The car arrived at the Waibaidu Bridge and turned west along Suzhou Creek to the Tianhou Palace Bridge. Although there were very high sandbags piled up at the south end of each bridge, there was no one stationed there. The lights north of the river were not as bright as usual, and there was silence, making the scene extremely desolate.

### Seaside Beach Employee Witnesses Intense Aerial and Naval Battle at Qiaogao, Enemy Ship Sunk by Our Bombs

Remaining Ships Fled in Panic

(Special Dispatch from this newspaper) According to an employee of the Qiaogao Seaside Beach, who arrived in Shanghai yesterday, he witnessed the bombing of Japanese warships by our air force in great detail on the morning of the 14th, which is unknown to outsiders. According to him, on the morning of the 14th, four Japanese warships suddenly appeared in the sea in front of the Qiaogao Seaside Beach. Their intention was to disrupt our army's rear and spy on the Pudong area. Shortly after the four warships anchored, our air force detected them. At about 10:15 AM that morning, our side immediately dispatched a large number of air force planes to bomb them. For a time, in the vast sky and sea, a large formation of iron birds soared up and down, the sound of engines grinding, and the aura was imposing. The enemy ships' anti-aircraft guns and machine guns fired together, and the many clouds of battle reflected with the clouds in the sky, forming a scene of a great naval battle. Our air force was unyielding and brave, surrounding the enemy ships and launching a heavy bombardment. One ship was hit by a heavy shell and was immediately destroyed and sunk. Seeing the situation was bad, the other three ships immediately fired up their engines and fled in panic. Our air force then returned triumphantly. The employee of the seaside beach, witnessing such a magnificent aerial and naval battle and seeing our air force triumph, was ecstatic. However, turning his head to consider the danger of his own situation, he was extremely frightened. So, he fled back to Shanghai in a hurry, but because vehicles were nowhere to be found, he had to walk out. Moreover, the journey was dangerous, with obstacles everywhere. After twists and turns lasting four days, he arrived in Shanghai yesterday. When talking about the situation of the aerial and naval battle at that time, he was still overwhelmed with excitement.

### Enemy Planes Bombing Everywhere

Bombs Dropped on Zhenru Hospital, Three Shot Down in Pudong, Our Side Suffers Minimal Losses

Longhua

Yesterday morning, enemy aircraft attacked our Longhua airfield three times. The first time was at 5 AM, when several enemy aircraft bombed the Longhua airfield, dropping a total of six bombs. The first bomb landed in the southeast corner of the Eurasia Aviation Company's aircraft factory, creating a hole about five feet deep and seven feet wide. The second bomb landed on the upper floor of the Eurasia Aviation Company's office, destroying the telegraph room. The other four bombs landed on the riverside, causing no losses. Our navy warships anchored on the river surface used anti-aircraft guns to fire, and the enemy aircraft fled in panic. At about 8 AM, enemy aircraft attacked again, dropping a large bomb in the China National Aviation Corporation airfield, creating a hole that was twelve feet deep and twenty feet wide. At around 10 AM, enemy aircraft attacked for the third time, dropping three more bombs. One bomb landed in the Eurasia Aviation Company airfield in Tangjiazhai, creating a hole two feet deep and three feet wide. Another bomb destroyed the doors and windows of the Eurasia Aviation Company's dining room. The remaining bomb landed on the riverside and did not explode. At 2:30 PM, enemy aircraft flew to the Longhua airfield again to bomb it, only destroying a portion of the housing. Because our aircraft had already been moved away, there were no losses.

Zhabei

At 7:45 AM yesterday morning, more than 20 enemy bombers, divided into several formations, flew over the Zhabei area and bombed our army's rear positions. Our troops had long known their usual tactic of throwing bombs to destroy, so they waited until they were close before using anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns to strafe the sky. At that time, the fighting was very fierce. The enemy aircraft dropped a total of more than 30 bombs, which all landed in the Zhabei Xinmin Road, Datong Road, the North Railway Station, and along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line. Several places caught fire at that time, burning fiercely, but they were soon extinguished. The rails and engine rooms of the two railway lines were also slightly damaged. At about 9 AM, after our troops' intense shooting, the enemy aircraft scattered and fled.

Three enemy aircraft flew to the rear of the Zhabei North Station and the vicinity of Baoshan Road and Baoxing Road after 9:30 PM last night. There were three fires caused by the bombs dropped. There was also a fire in Pudong, which spread fiercely. At that time, an enemy plane was shot down by us and fell in the western Shanghai area. The search is currently underway.

Pudong

At about 4 PM the day before yesterday, enemy aircraft dropped bombs in Pudong, and our troops used anti-aircraft guns to fire at them. One of them was hit by our artillery fire, and the tail immediately caught fire and burned. It crashed about a mile north of the Meifu Oil Depot wharf and was destroyed.

At about 9 AM the day before yesterday, an enemy plane reconnoitered the Longhua area and was shot in the tail by our troops firing anti-aircraft guns. The plane then flew towards the Nanhui County area of Pudong to escape. However, when it reached the vicinity of the county, the rear of the plane caught fire and burned, and it was forced to land there. Two enemy soldiers jumped out of the plane and ran into the fields in a panic. They were spotted by nine members of our self-defense corps. Just as they were about to step forward to question them, the enemy soldiers fired their guns. Our self-defense corps members also returned fire. As a result, both enemy soldiers were killed by us. As for the enemy plane, it had already been burned. The remaining parts of the plane have now been collected and sent to headquarters for disposal.

## Page 2

Starting from 8 AM yesterday, six enemy planes circled and reconnoitered over the Yangshupu area of Pudong, dropping a large number of incendiary bombs. As a result, two locations in Pudong, Qichang Warehouse and Yinxiang Port, caught fire. At around 2 PM, three enemy planes flew to the Pudong area opposite the 16th Pier, where they were attacked by our army's anti-aircraft artillery in more than 20 consecutive shots. One plane was hit and began to descend, but still struggled to escape. However, due to the ignition of fuel tanks, it soon crashed to the ground, according to the Central News Agency. Multiple Japanese warships are anchored near Takao, including one aircraft carrier. Planes from the carrier bombed Takao yesterday.

Zhenru

Three enemy planes bombed Zhenru yesterday morning, dropping 13 bombs on the wounded soldier hospital of Southeast Medical College. Several bombs exploded, fortunately causing only minor injuries to three people. The hospital captain was seriously injured. Furthermore, our Anti-Enemy Support Association sent Boy Scouts to deliver supplies to the front lines yesterday, but they were strafed by enemy planes. Fortunately, the troops hid under the trucks and only Jin Ming was hit in the waist by a bullet, which passed through. He has been sent to the hospital for treatment and is not in life-threatening condition. It is noted that the Southeast Medical College had Red Cross flags prominently displayed on the roof and all around, yet the Japanese planes disregarded the international Red Cross regulations and bombed indiscriminately. Their inhumanity is despised by people all over the world.

Liuhang

At 9 AM on the 17th, three Japanese planes arrived in Liuhang, and seven of our planes pursued them, exchanging machine-gun fire in fierce fighting for 20 minutes. The enemy planes panicked and dropped six bombs in the rice fields behind the Wanmao Sauce Garden, one bomb in a tofu shop in the northern part of the city, and one bomb in the river next to the Xinzha Bridge, killing one person and injuring two. Our planes were ultimately unable to withstand the assault and fled.

Jiading

On the 17th, Hou Huangqiao, west of Jiading West Gate, was bombed with two bombs and strafed with machine guns. The bombs did not explode, causing no damage.

### Enemy Planes Discovered in Shantou and Huizhou

Our Planes Pursue in the Air, Guangzhou Once Under Martial Law, Situation Tense in Shantou, Women and Children Leave for Hong Kong

[Hong Kong] At 9 AM on the 18th, three enemy planes were discovered in Shantou, flying from the south. Planes were immediately dispatched to pursue them in the air. Knowing that preparations had been made, the enemy turned to Taiwan. At the same time, four enemy planes were discovered in Huizhou. Upon receiving the report, Guangzhou issued an air raid alert and dispatched seven planes to intercept them. The enemy planes dared not approach the provincial capital and fled towards Humen. The alert was lifted at 11:20 AM (Special Dispatch of the 18th).

[Hong Kong] The situation in Shantou is tense. Telegrams to Hong Kong report the suspension of cargo handling. The Provincial Standing Committee is determined to resist and is advising women and children to leave, leaving only able-bodied men. Many people arrived in Hong Kong on the 18th (Special Dispatch of the 18th).

[Guangzhou] At 10:17 AM on the 18th, Japanese planes appeared in the sky outside Humen. Our air force dispatched a large squadron of planes to intercept them. Seeing our strong defense, the enemy planes immediately fled. When the alert issued its first warning, the citizens remained calm and orderly. The alert was lifted at 11:20 AM (Central News Agency Dispatch of the 18th).

[Shantou] Li Hanhun arrived in Shantou today to inspect the defenses and convened a meeting of heads of various agencies and representatives of organizations. Li delivered instructions, saying that in this extraordinary period, military, police, and government personnel should trust the leader, resolutely resist the war, and coexist with the land. Able-bodied citizens should also sacrifice their own interests and assist the government in resisting foreign aggression (Central News Agency Dispatch of the 17th).

[Shantou] A food inspection by the Shantou People's Food Association found that there was a large amount of grain in the city, and national rice was being imported steadily. The counties had a bumper harvest and did not need outside rice, so there was no fear of a grain shortage. The municipal government was ordered to set up multiple safe zones and will hold a refugee drill on the 20th (Special Dispatch of the 16th).

[Hong Kong] According to reliable foreign sources, a Japanese aircraft carrier is indeed anchored off the coast near Shantou. Therefore, the panic in Guangzhou today is not without reason. It is believed that Japanese planes may threaten Guangzhou in the coming days. At the same time, the number of Guangzhou residents coming to Hong Kong is increasing daily. Each ship and train arriving in Hong Kong carries thousands of people. There is widespread concern that the sudden increase in the number of residents in Hong Kong will soon become a serious problem (Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency of the 18th).

### British Consul-General in Shanghai Proposes Establishing a Neutral Zone in Shanghai

Britain Engaging in Negotiations with Relevant Countries, U.S. Policy Decides to Adopt a Middle Course

[London] According to the Daily Mail, the British Acting Consul-General in Shanghai, Davison, has drafted a plan that has been submitted to the Consuls-General of France, the United States, and Italy, proposing to establish a neutral zone around the International Settlement and the French Concession. The Chinese and Japanese armies should withdraw to outside this area. Davison, in view of the previous similar proposal being rejected by the Japanese side, now suggests that the powers represented in the International Settlement guarantee the maintenance of order in the neutralized area during the withdrawal period in order to eliminate this opposition. According to the report, the responsibilities of the powers under this plan are not easy to bear, and Britain cannot bear this responsibility alone with its limited troops stationed in Shanghai. Davison's proposal is a brave and friendly gesture. If France and the United States agree to the plan, then China and Japan will surely not sacrifice honor and cut off the only way to eliminate the great war, because both sides now do not want to fight this great war. The Daily Telegraph also stated in an editorial that the British Cabinet considered Davison's plan during yesterday's meeting, and it is said that it is now urgently engaging in diplomatic consultations with the governments of relevant countries. The Daily Telegraph also published an editorial supporting Davison's plan (Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency of the 18th).

[London] The Times' Washington correspondent stated this morning that the U.S. State Department's policy on the current situation in China is that the U.S. authorities are now faced with two schools of thought: one is the internationalist school, which advocates taking strong action to protect interests in China; the other is the nationalist school, which is more powerful and advocates withdrawing U.S. troops in China and letting U.S. citizens take care of themselves. The government has decided on a middle course between the two, that is, to avoid war on the one hand and to do its best to protect its citizens on the other. Whether to assist Americans who are harmed or to participate in international cooperation when necessary to defend the Shanghai International Settlement, there is an appropriate definition of how to provide a protected environment. The U.S. government adopts this middle course, hoping to protect the lives of Americans without slightly damaging American dignity (Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency of the 18th).

[London] The Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, Sir Little, is currently stationed in Shanghai, responsible for assisting the British Army in China in protecting the International Settlement. According to recent news, the British warships currently in Shanghai include the cruiser HMS Kent (flagship of the British Fleet), HMS Suffolk (anchored near Ma'an Island), the light cruiser HMS Danae, the destroyer flagship HMS Duncan, the destroyer HMS Duchess, and the sloop HMS Falmouth. In Qingdao are the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle and the destroyers HMS Dainty, HMS Elegant, and HMS Delight. In Qinhuangdao are the minelayer HMS Adventure and the destroyer HMS Watchman. In Nanjing is the cruiser HMS Capetown. In Yantai is the destroyer HMS Diana (Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency of the 17th).

[Washington] The U.S. government has recently ordered 1,200 Marines from San Diego, California, to be deployed to Shanghai to protect overseas Chinese. The Marines are expected to depart within ten days and arrive in Shanghai within five weeks. Secretary of State Hull said that 1,400 American women and children in Shanghai are expected to be evacuated by the end of this weekend, mostly on commercial ships. After that, about 2,500 American citizens will remain in Shanghai. The State Department has requested an allocation of 500,000 for the evacuation of overseas Chinese. Furthermore, the United States has decided to follow a "middle course" between extreme nationalism and internationalism in this war between China and Japan, on the one hand, not showing a belligerent attitude to other countries, and on the other hand, resolutely protecting its own citizens (Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency of the 17th).

[Washington] The U.S. government has recently notified the governments of China and Japan separately that during the war in Shanghai, the material losses suffered by American citizens will be the direct responsibility of the respective governments (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency of the 17th).

[Washington] President Roosevelt has today formally recognized that China and Japan are "at war" and is preparing to implement the Neutrality Act for the two countries immediately. This is the result of detailed discussions with government officials yesterday based on reports of the war in Shanghai. Secretary of State Hull and Secretary of War Woodring both participated in the discussions. If the President announces the implementation of the Act, then American merchants will not be able to transport any munitions or war supplies to China and Japan in the future (National Telegram of the 17th).

### British Press Commentary

[London] The proposal put forward by Foreign Secretary Eden after meeting with Lord Halifax, the Lord Privy Seal, Naval Secretary Cooper, and Land Secretary Belisha yesterday, which requested China and Japan to each withdraw their troops from Shanghai, and entrusted the protection of Japan's interests in the International Settlement to other countries, has been commented on by the press here. All believe that this is the last opportunity for the Japanese government to weigh the advantages and disadvantages. The Times stated that Japan is currently facing a choice between maintaining military prestige and safeguarding its overseas Chinese. If the country decides to safeguard the safety of its overseas Chinese, "neutral countries will undoubtedly do their best to promote the simultaneous withdrawal of Chinese and Japanese troops. There is no doubt about this, but it is feared that Japan will still consider maintaining military prestige to be the better course." The Conservative Party's Daily Telegraph stated, "Japanese politicians who do not belong to the militarists have been misled by the war party and have entered a predicament. The Japanese cabinet must regret this. Since a few weeks ago, Japan's policy toward China has unintentionally caused a huge wave and is suffering its disadvantages. What Britain is seeking is not to establish a permanent dam, but to stop this wave in time so that it can subside on its own." The Labor Party's organ, the Daily Mail, stated that the entire indivisible peace has collapsed, and the major powers can only stand by and watch. "What Japan seeks is to consolidate its military and diplomatic relations with China without allowing foreign interference. This has been the case for forty years," it said (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency of the 18th).

### Britain Concerned About the Situation in the Far East

Believes a Major War is Unavoidable, Determined to Do Everything Possible to Protect Overseas Chinese

[London] Official circles here today are very pessimistic about the situation in the Far East, believing that a major war is unavoidable. At present, Prime Minister Chamberlain has not indicated that he will convene an emergency cabinet meeting, but this move is highly likely. Foreign Secretary Eden will have to shorten his holiday and return to London immediately (National Telegram of the 7th).

[London] British cabinet members met again today to discuss the evacuation of overseas Chinese from Shanghai, but declared that this move did not mean evacuating all overseas Chinese immediately. Those merchants who remain in the port will be given every possible protection by the British authorities. Furthermore, regarding the issue of maintaining the security of the Shanghai Settlement, it is generally believed that the relocation of the Japanese warship "Izumo" has reduced the danger to the International Settlement, but it is still doubtful whether the Japanese authorities can slightly restrain their concept of naval power and pay attention to the interests of overseas Chinese. In fact, Japan should not use the International Settlement as a talisman for war and invite attacks from the Chinese side (Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency of the 17th).

### U.S. State Department Changes Organization

Head of the Far East Division Replaced

[Washington] The U.S. State Department has made major changes to its organization due to the Far East Incident. Hamilton has been appointed as the head of the Far East Division, and the original head of the Far East Division, Hornbeck, has been reassigned as an advisor to the Far East Division, a newly created position. According to Secretary of State Hull, this move will increase the convenience of formulating Far East policies. However, there is still no definite plan to strengthen the Asian Fleet, and the issue of invoking the Neutrality Act is being considered almost every day (Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency of the 17th).

### British and Canadian Merchant Ships Suspend Sailings to Shanghai

[London] The British Steamship Company today announced the suspension of sailings to Shanghai (Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency of the 18th).

⊙ Vancouver The Canadian naval authorities have now issued a notice to shipping companies that all ships heading to Shanghai should be diverted to other ports (Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency of the 17th).

### Chiang Kai-shek Sends High-Ranking Officials to Shanghai to Comfort the Fighting Generals and Soldiers

Maintain the Physical Strength and Morale of Officers and Soldiers, Investigate the Names of Fallen Officers and Soldiers, Huang Renlin Represents the Air Force

[Nanjing] Chiang Kai-shek, on the 18th, noted that the officers and soldiers fighting in Shanghai had been fighting hard for days, repeatedly defeating stubborn enemies, and were loyal, brave, hardworking, and deeply missed. He specially telegraphed General Commander Zhang Zhizhong and the two division commanders Wang and Sun to praise and encourage them, and specially sent two high-ranking officials to comfort them, and ordered them to report in detail the names of the fallen officers and soldiers in order to provide condolences. It is believed that the entire army will be even more inspired and encouraged upon hearing this. The text of the telegram is as follows (some titles omitted): ㊀ Our officers and soldiers have been fighting hard for days, sparing no sacrifice, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Their spirit of sincerity and bravery is worthy of being a follower of our Premier's revolution. In addition to commendation, I feel deeply missed. I am specially sending □□□□□□ to Shanghai to express my condolences. I hope that you will continue to be loyal, wipe out the stubborn bandits, and achieve meritorious service as soon as possible. I am expecting you. ㊁ The physical strength and morale of all officers and soldiers before going into battle must be specially maintained and given more rest to increase combat effectiveness. ㊂ The names of all fallen officers and soldiers should be reported in detail as soon as possible for condolences and to commemorate their loyalty and heroism. The above three items should be communicated to all officers and soldiers for information (Central News Agency Dispatch of the 18th).

[Nanjing] When enemy planes attacked our capital on the 15th and 16th, some soldiers and civilians used rifles or pistols to shoot at them from a distance. This was out of a sincere desire to defend against aggression, but because the enemy planes dared not fly low over the capital due to the bravery of our air force and the strictness of the air defense arrangements, it was impossible for us to hit them with rifles and pistols. Not only was it a waste of bullets, which was deeply regrettable, but it was also feared that stray bullets would cause accidents. Chiang Kai-shek learned of this situation and specially issued a strict order on the 18th to all those who were not responsible for air defense, whether soldiers or civilians, not to fire from a distance when enemy planes attacked, in order to maintain order and avoid danger. This is something that our soldiers and civilians should strictly observe during the air defense period (Central News Agency Dispatch of the 18th).

[Nanjing] Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, on the 18th, specially sent Huang Renlin to represent them in comforting the air force officers and soldiers, and distributed condolence money, one for each person, containing food, cigarettes, phonographs, etc. The secretary of the U.S. Embassy, British and American military attachés, and British and American reporters accompanied them and inspected a certain location. The two heavy bombers that were shot down on the 15th fell straight down, with half of the fuselage buried in the mud (Central News Agency Dispatch of the 18th).

### Yunnan Merchants Determined to Save the Country and Sacrifice Their Fortunes to Help the Nation

Li Hengsheng Donates One Million Yuan, Zhang Zhengchang Contributes Three Hundred Thousand

[Kunming] Li Hengsheng, a mine owner from Gejiu, Yunnan, from Shiping, is nearly seventy years old and said that he regrets that he is too old and weak to go to the front line to kill the enemy himself. He resolutely donated his family fortune of one million yuan to serve the country. It is reported that he has already remitted 500,000 yuan to the province, requesting the Anti-Enemy Support Association to transfer it to the Central Government to subsidize military needs. The remaining half will also be remitted to help earthquake victims in the war zone. Li said that only by preserving the country can we preserve our families. Fellow Chinese compatriots are enthusiastically contributing and fulfilling their respective responsibilities (Central News Agency Dispatch of the 17th).

[Nanjing] Yunnan merchant Zhang Zhengtang telegraphed Lin Sen, Chiang Kai-shek, and Wang Jingwei from Gejiu, "Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, Chairman Wang, I, a lowly subject, report to you: The tyrannical Japanese have launched a major offensive against us. The central government is determined to resist, and the people of the whole country are inspired. I, Zhengtang, am far away in a corner of the border and have a heart to serve the country. I respectfully scrape together my family fortune and remit 300,000 Yunnan Old Currency to the province, to be transferred by the Yunnan Anti-Enemy Support Association to the national government for verification and collection, to subsidize the anti-enemy military expenses and to relieve the war-torn refugees. I respectfully report this by telegram. I will provide more details in another document. Zhang Zhengtang, a merchant from Shiping, Yunnan, who is traveling in Gejiu, kowtows." Wang Jingwei replied by telegram, "To Zhang Zhengtang, a merchant from Shiping, Yunnan, who is traveling in Gejiu: I have read your telegram of the 16th. I deeply admire your sacrifice of your family fortune to help the nation. The soldiers at the front and the compatriots of the whole country will be even more inspired. I specially send this telegram in reply. Wang Zhaoming bows (18th) (Central News Agency Dispatch of the 18th)."

[Nanjing] The Nanjing Municipal Party Department and the Capital's All-Sector Support Association, in view of the fact that the air force has been punishing enemy planes and defending the capital in recent days, dispatched representatives such as Zhang Yuanliang to comfort the air force officers and soldiers with gifts of condolence, with passionate scenes.

### Enemy Attack on Nankou Suffers Another Defeat

Our Forces Consolidate Positions on the Right Flank, Enemy Remnants Retreat to Tianjin and Beiping for Reorganization

[Nanjing] Military Headquarters reports: On the 16th, in the Nankou area, approximately three to four thousand enemy troops, under cover of intense artillery fire, attacked our high ground on the left flank. Our forces fiercely counterattacked, killing over three hundred enemy soldiers and wounding countless others. The enemy was unable to sustain the assault and retreated. Furthermore, in the Nankou area, following fierce battles on the 14th, 15th, and 16th, and the failure of their frontal assaults, the enemy on the 17th used its main force to encircle and attack our right-flank positions. However, the terrain there is precipitous and dangerous, and our positions are extremely strong. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)

[Baoding] At noon on the 18th, three enemy aircraft circled at high altitude over the northeast suburbs of Baoding for about ten minutes before departing. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)

[Baoding] Enemy forces have repeatedly attacked Nankou but have not succeeded. It is reported that the enemy has recently withdrawn the remnants of their forces from Nankou to the Tianjin and Beiping area for reorganization, and it seems they will dispatch new troops as reinforcements in an attempt to attack again.

[Tianjin] Large numbers of Japanese soldiers continue to arrive in North China. Yesterday, sixteen transport ships arrived off Dagukou, carrying infantry, cavalry, and military supplies. However, tanks and heavy artillery were not seen. Recently, at least one hundred special motor launches have arrived in Tianjin from Japan to transport troops ashore from the ships. These launches have been extremely busy these past two days. In addition, three Japanese warships are anchored between Dagukou and the coast for protection. Part of the army landed on the south bank of the Hai River and will likely march to Tianjin on foot, instead of taking the train, because the train is currently transporting troops, ammunition, and military supplies from Shanhaiguan to the interior. Railway transportation is extremely chaotic. A journey that normally takes six hours on the Beidaihe section now takes over thirty hours. At 8:00 PM on the 17th, a small unit of Japanese cavalry entered Tianjin from Dagukou, the horses completely exhausted. (Reuters dispatch via Central News Agency, 18th)

Wu Peifu Under Surveillance

[Xuzhou] A certain railway worker, recently arrived in Xuzhou via Beiping, stated that the Japanese army had already occupied Beiping and taken over various institutions.

The market appears superficially stable, but in reality, it is extremely depressed. Many university professors are taking roundabout routes south. Wu Peifu has been placed under surveillance by the Japanese army for not participating in the maintenance association. Many intellectuals are leaving Beiping in disguise. Most of the artifacts from the Forbidden City and Yuanmingyuan, except for a portion hurriedly moved to Baoding by the Second Army, have been looted by the Japanese army. Although diplomatic missions from various countries have tried to dissuade them, the Japanese warlords turned a deaf ear. Previous reports that various countries were jointly protecting overseas Chinese in Beiping were actually only limited to a corner of Dongjiaomin Lane.

Current Commentary

### Our Initial Victory

— Bin

Shanghai has been under fire, bombarded by aircraft and bombs, for almost a week. Over the past week, thanks to the bloody and arduous battles fought by our heroic soldiers of the army and air force, we have achieved an initial victory. Three important military bases of the enemy, both before and after, have been occupied by our forces. The flagship "Izumo" of the enemy's Third Fleet has been damaged by our bombing. The large number of enemy troops who landed in Pudong the day before yesterday have also been defeated by our forces. The enemy has lost contact with its forces both before and after. The enemy's entire position has been heavily surrounded by our troops.

At the same time, news of our army's great victory has also come from the north. On the 15th, Shangdu was recovered. On the 16th and 17th, it was also reported that Zhangbei, Huade, Shangyi, Nanhaogian, and Chongli were successively recovered. From this point forward, the enemy's nest in Chahar will soon be swept away. Our strategically important Nankou pass is now in a state of "impregnable defense." What we want to emphasize in particular here is the battle of Nankou. Our Luo unit fought valiantly and resolutely, resulting in the entire regiment being martyred. None of the members, including the regimental commander, survived. Their spirit of heroic sacrifice has further inspired the determination of our brave soldiers to kill the enemy.

The successive advances of our troops in Shanghai and Chahar these past few days have provided a strong negative answer to those who underestimate the strength of our soldiers. Some people once thought that our air force was useless. Now, isn't it our loyal and brave air force that is roaring in the air, destroying enemy defenses? Some people also thought that our army could not withstand the sharp artillery of Japanese imperialism. Now, isn't it our brave soldiers who are repelling the enemy step by step along the Huangpu River and outside the Great Wall passes? All the slander that previously insulted our loyal and brave soldiers, all the estimates that underestimated the strength of our army's combat power, have now been completely destroyed by our army's actual actions. Of course, we are not complacent with this initial small victory. In the long course of the future war of resistance, we will inevitably suffer setbacks. However, we believe that these setbacks will not weaken our will to resist the enemy. We firmly believe that as long as we have the determination to resist the war with one heart, final victory will surely belong to us. As long as we have the determination not to fear sacrifice, we will surely be able to gain survival from sacrifice. As Clausewitz said well, "The greater and stronger the motivation for war, the broader the scope of the war including the survival of the nation, and the stronger the tense atmosphere of the war, the more the war becomes a matter of overcoming the enemy." Our war of resistance is to resist the aggression of Japanese imperialism and to strive for the survival of our entire nation. Our motivation is great and strong. We will surely be able to achieve final victory.

The curtain of the sacred and great national self-defense war has been lightly lifted. The people of the whole country should rise up and support the war from all aspects with a calm and resolute attitude. We will not give up until we have completely driven the enemy's iron hooves out of our territory.

### Japan's Invasion of China Regardless of All-Out Bet

Financial and Economic Strength is Strong Outside But Hollow Inside, British Newspaper Observes, Difficult to Sustain

[London] The Manchester Guardian's editorial today stated that in 1932, when Japan invaded Shanghai, it miscalculated, and the result was nothing more than a final withdrawal. Japan is now risking sending Red Army troops to land in Shanghai. The government appears to be trying its best to break Japan's plan to let troops land. Japan probably considers China's resistance to be stronger than expected. What Japan is doing in Shanghai is ultimately gambling. (Reuters dispatch via Central News Agency, 18th)

[London] The London Evening Standard carried an article today stating that a war between Japan and the Chinese people can be sustained for half a year, but beyond half a year, Japan's financial needs may become unstable. Japan's overseas trade position is extremely fragile, the trade balance is increasingly unfavorable, gold reserves are almost non-existent, and borrowing is hopeless. The newspaper stated that Japan's domestic financial economy, compared to before the invasion of Manchuria, has lost its true color and has a seemingly strong but hollow appearance. "Although the surface is full of patriotic enthusiasm, in its heart, the countryside is devastated. What was previously promised to the peasants, that after occupying Manchuria, foreign financial resources would flow in, is now equal to drawing cakes to satisfy hunger. If it continues to engage in military force without end, the people who cannot survive will cause the armor to disintegrate." (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### Kong Ding Leaves Europe for Home Today

Austrian Government Presents Kong Dong Zhang, Symbol of Friendship Between the Two Countries

⊙ Port of Genoa, Italy: Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, will arrive here this afternoon from Vienna, and is scheduled to board the German mail ship "Scharnhorst" tomorrow from here to return home. (Havas dispatch via Central News Agency, 18th)

Kong and his entourage departed in the evening for the Italian port of Genoa to board a ship back home. Prior to his departure, [Kong] provided Havas Agency reporters with a written interview to be published in various newspapers, stating, "Austria and China have always had close ties. Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and his cabinet members have been extremely kind to me, which is due to their respect for my country's government and people. I am also very pleased to have been able to discuss friendly cooperation between Austria and China with the Austrian government." (Havas dispatch, 16th)

### Yang Hucheng Decides to Return Home to Volunteer

Delivers Speech in France, Denounces Japanese Atrocities

[Paris] General Yang Hucheng, former Pacification Director of Shaanxi Province, China, gave his views on the Far East situation at the invitation of the International Committee Against War and Fascism yesterday. The audience was large and the seats were full, including important figures from all walks of life in Paris, journalists, and students from the Chinese Academy. Yang first expressed his gratitude to the committee for their warm reception, and then criticized fascism around the world, saying that it has caused great harm, especially Japanese fascism, which threatens peace in the Far East. Until recently, the United States and the Soviet Union concluded a commercial agreement first, and then Britain and the Soviet Union concluded a naval agreement, and China completed its reunification, which added good factors to anti-fascism. As for why Japan attacked China, it was to implement the Tanaka Memorial, which everyone knows, and the final goal is to dominate the world. "Since the success of the Northern Expedition in 1927, China has established a strong government, and its economy and finances have been organized. The heroic resistance in Shanghai in 1932 is even more commendable. Since then, under the leadership of our leader General Chiang Kai-shek, our country has been completely unified." China is an ancient civilization that has always respected culture. "This time, the war of resistance is not only to deal with aggressive Japan, but it is also related to world peace, and there is a chance of victory. The interests of the Chinese and French nations are the same, without the need for further explanation." Yang Mingsuan (transliteration), a professor at a university in Shanghai, happened to be in Europe for inspection and then followed General Yang Hucheng with a few words to explain the situation in China.

### British and American Battleships Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday to Protect the Safety of the International Concession

British and American Ships Connect Bow to Stern in the Huangpu River, Cannons Uncovered, Muzzles Facing North, French Government Also Transfers Annamese Troops to Shanghai

British and American women and children, due to the outbreak of the Shanghai war, are inevitably timid, and have been temporarily evacuating to Shanghai these days. All British and American men still work in Shanghai as usual and do not go elsewhere. Some rumor-mongers are spreading rumors that the British and American overseas Chinese are withdrawing and will abandon the concession, so ignorant citizens are extremely panicked, and public sentiment has been somewhat fluctuating these days. In fact, the British and American authorities are concerned about trade in the Far East, and not only have no intention of withdrawing overseas Chinese, but have also sent giant warships to Shanghai for protection, which shows that the unfounded rumors are not credible. The situation of British and American ships arriving in Shanghai is as follows:

British and American Battleships Have Arrived

For the sake of protecting the safety of the Shanghai International Concession, Britain and the United States decided to send warships and armies to Shanghai. First, two battalions of British Worcestershire infantry, coming from Hong Kong, have arrived in Shanghai on the Blue Funnel Line's Maron and Asia. Starting yesterday, the newly arrived British soldiers have begun to take over the defenses along the Suzhou Creek. As for the two cruisers each urgently transferred by the two countries from Hong Kong and Yantai to Shanghai, they also arrived one after another yesterday, all entering the Huangpu River and mooring along the Bund. The American cruiser Alldnbte, after entering the port yesterday, immediately dropped anchor in front of the Bund Three-Road River surface. Because the ship is large, it extends from the Customs House to the Wusong River. The ship's guns are facing north, and the anti-aircraft guns, machine guns, and large cannons are all uncovered. There are seven or eight hundred officers and soldiers on the ship. Behind the American cruiser is the British ship, and behind the British ship is another American ship. From the Jiangmian at the Second-Road intersection to the Sixteen Puds, the British and American ships have been connected bow to stern, and large and small iron barges and ships are moored on the left and right, creating a "fleet city" in the Huangpu River, protecting the British and French concessions in a roundabout way. Each country's flag is painted on the ship to avoid air strikes. With so many ships (eight British ships, five American ships, and French ships) protecting the concession, it is safer, and the hearts of overseas Chinese in Shanghai can also be greatly stabilized.

British Soldiers Deployed Yesterday

A total of eight hundred British soldiers arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 17th and were stationed at the Racecourse General Assembly, replacing the American Corps of the Chamber of Commerce at the defense post on North Henan Road, because the members of the Chamber of Commerce have been on defense in that area for days and are very tired, so they need to rest for a while. The Asia-Pacific steamer, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai today or tomorrow, carries a thousand British rifle soldiers, and the steamer will continue to carry British overseas Chinese women and children to Hong Kong. When the Asia-Pacific steamer returns to Hong Kong, if the situation in Shanghai has not changed, it seems that the ship will continue to carry the British Infantry Regiment to Shanghai. The British Infantry Regiment stationed in Singapore is scheduled to leave for Hong Kong on Friday, and the Indian Infantry Regiment stationed in the Pacific is also preparing to leave for Hong Kong.

American Soldiers Arriving Quickly in Shanghai

The Shanghai Times reported that last night (17th), it was learned that the 31st Infantry Division of the United States Army, currently stationed in Manila, is awaiting orders to leave for Shanghai. After receiving this news, the American authorities in Shanghai, considering the seriousness of the situation in Shanghai, believed that the division might have to leave for Shanghai immediately, and if there is a fast ship available, it can arrive in Shanghai within three days.

France Decides to Send Troops East

According to dispatches from Paris yesterday, the French government, in view of the dangerous situation in the Far East, has sent troops to Shanghai to protect the safety of the French Concession. The Shin Shih reporter specifically inquired with the French Concession Police Bureau. According to reports, the Concession authorities believed that the situation was extremely critical after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war in Shanghai. In order to ensure the strict neutrality of the Shanghai Concession and to protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese within the Concession, in addition to deploying troops stationed in Shanghai for alert, they also sent a telegram to the French government for urgent assistance. Now, the French government has decided to send troops stationed in Annam in the vicinity to Shanghai, and the team will arrive in Shanghai on the 24th of this month to carry out all defense work within the Concession.

French Police Strictly Patrol

The French Police Bureau, in order to maintain law and order within the Concession, in addition to mobilizing French and Vietnamese army and navy soldiers to Shanghai for protection, and sending armored vehicles for armed patrols within the Concession every day, the police stations also sent detectives to patrol in sections. The duty police have been temporarily dismissed and incorporated into the patrol team. Yesterday, two Russian police officers were assigned, led by a Chinese police officer as a group, and a large number of chauffeur cars from the Yunfei Car Company were hired to patrol the Concession. An order was issued that all detectives should be stationed at the police station and not leave without authorization, in case of emergency protection.

### Expressions of Condolences from Leaders of All Circles to Zhang Zhizhong at the Front

Support from the Rear Should Prepare for Long-Term Resistance, Must Do Our Best to Protect the Lives and Property of Overseas Chinese

Leaders of all circles in this city, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, Song Ziwen, etc., went to the front at 10:00 AM yesterday to meet with Zhang Zhizhong, the commander of the Jinghu Garrison, to express their condolences on behalf of the citizens of this city and to present each senior commander with a beautifully made telescope. Mr. Zhang talked with them for half an hour during military affairs, and deeply thanked the rulers of this city for their concern for the soldiers on the front. Mr. Zhang also stated that this time, due to the enemy's reckless invasion, we had no choice but to rise up and fight for survival. Now, the war has officially begun, and the seriousness of the war is very different from the January 28th Incident. Protecting the country and defending the people is the natural duty of soldiers, and they should devote themselves to the battlefield and strive for victory in the end. However, the people in the rear should also calmly prepare for a long-term resistance. Regarding the letters and telegrams of condolences from various places and the donation of condolence items, Mr. Zhang said that the soldiers on the front do not hope for material condolences. Mr. Zhang said, "Our army has rice to quench hunger, so there is no need for biscuits; there is water to quench thirst, so there is no need for fruit. If the people in the rear can use useful money to purchase military supplies such as sacks, steel wires, and communication equipment and transport them to the front, then the actual results of killing the enemy and achieving victory will be even greater." Finally, Mr. Zhang said that Shanghai is a place where overseas Chinese from various countries reside, and it should not be used as a battlefield. However, the outbreak of this war was entirely caused by the Japanese army's invasion. We were forced to fight for survival, which is seen by the whole world. Since the beginning of the war, the Japanese army has used the Concession as a military base of various favorable kinds, causing our army's advance to be greatly restricted. Under these difficult circumstances, our army has always respected the lives and property of overseas Chinese. However, in order to strive for military advantages, there are inevitably some unavoidable accidents that cause losses to friendly overseas Chinese. This is what our army absolutely does not want to do, and we express our regret. I think the friendly officials and people will be able to understand. In short, the Chinese people have always loved peace. At the time of this full-scale war of resistance, we will also do our best to achieve the goal of protecting the lives and property of overseas Chinese.

### Silk Industry Supports National Salvation Bonds

The Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association, upon hearing of the government's issuance of National Salvation Bonds, sent a special telegram to the central government in support, which read: "To the Honorable Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission in Nanjing, and to the Honorable Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance, and Vice Minister Xu Shimin: The Japanese寇are encroaching upon our borders, inflicting ever greater suffering. Your esteemed selves are leading the nation in a resolute resistance, displaying our might and quelling their aggression. The people of the nation are all roused and galvanized. However, a protracted war requires vast military expenditures, and sporadic donations are insufficient. This association, with its limited perspective, in addition to subscribing to 100,000 yuan of the first tranche of National Salvation Donations, suggests that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce be requested to ask your esteemed selves to follow the precedents of other countries and issue wartime bonds. Now that we have seen in the newspapers that the government has decided to issue 500 million yuan of National Salvation Bonds, all of us in the industry express our deep admiration and send this telegram in support, praying for its early implementation. Respectfully, Luo Qinghua, Chairman of the Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association, bows."

### British Chamber of Commerce Receives London Telegram Denying Evacuation of British Nationals

Only Some Women and Children Continued to Leave Shanghai Yesterday

The English-language "Ta Kung Pao Evening News" reported that the British Chamber of Commerce in this city has received a telegram from London, firmly denying that it had ever considered a complete evacuation of British nationals from Shanghai.

Central News Agency, London, 18th (Havas) - British diplomatic sources have denied the reports that British nationals in Shanghai have been ordered to evacuate, stating that the British authorities will do everything possible to protect the safety of British nationals who wish to continue residing in the Shanghai International Settlement.

The "Zi Lin Daily" reported that at an emergency meeting held by the Danish community in this city at the Great Northern Telegraph Company on Tuesday, the Danish Minister to China, Mr. Voxholm, announced that arrangements are being made to transport Danish women and children to Hong Kong on two Norwegian ships. The first ship is scheduled to depart on Wednesday. Those who wish to remain in Shanghai are free to do so. The two ships will also carry Norwegian and Swedish women and children. It is also planned that British women and children will leave Shanghai on the "Victoria" on Wednesday. A total of 3,176 British nationals in this city have already left Shanghai or have tickets预佛for departure.

### Financial Stability Enhanced After Ministry of Finance Announces Measures

Government Ensures Proper Protection of Deposits and Savings; Maintains Circulation of Funds in Various Cities

The Ministry of Finance has formulated and announced measures to stabilize finances during this extraordinary period. All banks approved by the Ministry of Finance, and subject to the Ministry's supervision and inspection at any time, and whose reports are submitted for verification as required, are now subject to restrictions on withdrawals. However, various deposits and savings made by individuals are fully protected as they have been thoroughly investigated by the government, ensuring that they will not suffer any losses. Depositors should not be unduly worried by temporary inconveniences in withdrawals. The Ministry of Finance has also issued a circular to local governments in inland cities, which are closely linked to Shanghai's finances, to jointly ensure safety. According to those familiar with the financial situation, although we are now entering a period of full-scale resistance, the foundation for financial stability is very solid, and there will be no impact whatsoever. Furthermore, in order to maintain the circulation of funds in various cities in the country, the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed the provincial and municipal governments, chambers of commerce, and guilds of money shops, the original text of which is as follows: "[Omitted title] Having investigated the measures for stabilizing finances during this extraordinary period, which have been announced and implemented, it is necessary to find ways to maintain the circulation of funds in various cities in the interior. However, the organization of money shops in the interior is often unsound, and their business practices are often not in full compliance with legal requirements. Since the Shanghai money shop exchange system cannot be imitated in the interior, and conditions vary from place to place, in order to stabilize the overall financial situation and maintain circulation in various cities, the Ministry has written to the four banks, namely, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Farmers Bank of China, to establish joint offices in major cities where they have branches, tasking them with understanding local conditions and formulating appropriate measures to be reported to the Ministry for implementation. In addition to separate letters and telegrams, this special telegram is sent for your information."

### All Sectors Offer Condolences to Soldiers Resisting the Japanese Aggression

The soldiers all expressed their gratitude and stated that they were imbued with the spirit of invincibility, fought in the thick of the battle under heavy fire, and finally caused the enemy to retreat step by step. This is the duty of soldiers. Once their injuries have healed slightly, they must rush to the front lines again. Their loyalty and courage were evident in their words and expressions. The small number of wounded soldiers in each hospital is a testament to the superiority of our military tactics.

The Special Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Party, with all its staff, recognizing the admirable loyalty and courage of the soldiers who were wounded while resisting the enemy at the front lines, specially donated funds to purchase a large quantity of towels, biscuits, canned goods, and other food items, and sent personnel to various military hospitals to comfort the wounded soldiers in order to boost morale and fulfill their duties.

The Board of Directors of the Municipal Council has approved this proposal, and the director of the General Omnibus Company has agreed to implement this measure in a possible manner.

Sufficient Grain Reserves in Shanghai

Shanghai currently has more than 500,000担of rice in reserve, enough to maintain the city's food supply for six months. The Food Committee is still transporting rice from various inland areas to Shanghai to provide assistance. Currently, rice shops in the Chinese concessions of this city are open for business except in dangerous areas. Rumors that there will be a shortage of grain are completely untrue.

French Municipal Council Forms Food Committee

The Shanghai French Municipal Council resolved to form a special committee called the "Shanghai French Concession Food Committee" at an extraordinary meeting on August 16. The committee is responsible for taking all necessary measures to maintain the food supply for residents in the French Concession in Shanghai during the war. The committee held its first meeting at the council at 2:00 p.m. on the 17th, and will meet there every day at 2:00 p.m. thereafter. The chairman of the committee is Mr. Chassin, the commercial attaché of the French Embassy.

### Refugees Crowd into Concessions, Relief Efforts Intensify

Planning to Send Refugees Out of the City

The United Association of Citizens of the Second Special District states that, although various relief organizations have been working separately to accommodate the refugees who are pouring into the concessions, their numbers continue to grow, making it difficult to cope. This situation not only makes providing supplies difficult, but also disrupts order. Furthermore, gathering these refugees in reception centers is not a long-term solution. Therefore, they have petitioned the municipal government to find ways to send the refugees back to their hometowns or relocate them to neighboring counties for safety.

The Repatriation Group of the Municipal Relief Committee held a subcommittee meeting yesterday morning at 8:30 AM to discuss arranging ships and vehicles for repatriation. They are also seeking repatriation permits from the Jinghu Garrison Headquarters. They have now resolved that once all the necessary procedures are finalized, they will begin sending refugees from various reception centers out of the city in batches, after numbering them. However, the committee currently lacks trucks and gasoline and hopes that enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life will donate generously to facilitate the repatriation efforts.

Rescuing Refugees in Eastern Shanghai

The Yangshupu area has fallen into a war zone, and the residents there are mostly poor. Many were unable to escape in time, resulting in a large number being tragically killed by enemy guns, bullets, and bayonets. Yesterday, with the consent of the Red Cross Society and the Japanese army, passage through the Hongkou Japanese Defense Zone was permitted for the purpose of rescuing refugees. Upon approval by the Municipal Council, ten trucks were dispatched around 1:00 PM to Hongkou and Yangshupu to evacuate refugees in succession. The operation continued until late at night. Countless numbers were injured and have been sent to various hospitals for treatment.

Ningbo Refugees Continue Returning Home

The Ningbo Natives Association in Shanghai reopened the Yiyuan Sheng Lane Mingxing Grand Theater yesterday as a shelter for fellow Ningbo refugees, bringing the total number of shelters to six. Regarding evacuation efforts, in addition to chartering the Fushen merchant ship on the 16th to transport 2,000 refugees back to their hometown, the ship returned to Shanghai yesterday and is continuing to transport another batch of Ningbo natives. If there are no obstacles, it is expected to arrive in Ningbo this morning.

Wuxi Refugees Await Repatriation

The Wuxi Natives Association has been working for days to provide relief and shelter for refugees. It has also organized a rescue team that goes to the front lines daily to rescue wounded soldiers. The Xianglin Hospital on Beijing Road has been temporarily designated as the association's first emergency hospital, but it is now full. Plans are underway to establish a second hospital. As for the refugee shelters, the number of people has reached over 5,000. The first and second shelters have been located at No. 474 and No. 476 Zhejiang Road, respectively, and a third shelter will be established today at the Shilu intersection on Sanma Road. However, the refugees urgently need to be repatriated in batches, but there is a shortage of ships. Therefore, those who are enthusiastic about public welfare and have transport ships or civilian vessels are encouraged to contact the association at No. 116 Zhonghui Building, Aiduya Road. The association will provide appropriate subsidies.

10,000 People Rescued from War Zone

Teams One and Two of the Red Swastika Society Rescue Team, led by team leader Hu Zhongcheng and Shi Xiangxing, departed at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. They split into three routes to provide relief. The first route went to Hengfeng Bridge, followed Jinlu Road and Datong Road, and then turned to Jiaotong Road to rescue one wounded soldier, who was sent back to the association's first temporary hospital. They then went to the Zhabei area. While scouting ahead near Xiaocai Chang, they encountered intense artillery fire. Two shells landed close to the team. Immediately, refugees, hearing the sound, surged forward seeking assistance. Many women and children were rescued from danger. The second route rescued seven wounded soldiers and one injured civilian along the Huta Road, and they were sent to hospitals one and two for treatment. The third route rescued over 10,000 elderly people, children, and women in Yangshupu, Pingliang Road, Peikai'er Road, Yangzhou Road, and Tangshan Road, among other places. Several people were injured and sent to the second hospital. Hundreds of those who had nowhere to go were sent to the fourth reception center. In the afternoon, team leader Shan Hu led stretcher bearers to Zhongshan Road and Huta Road, rescuing over ten wounded soldiers. It was found that the first hospital received over ten wounded soldiers yesterday, and the second hospital received forty-eight wounded soldiers.

Monks Participate in Rescue Efforts

The Monks Rescue Team, jointly organized by monks from various temples in the city, has a total of 200 members. All members have received considerable training in rescue skills. In recent days, the team, led by Master Hongming, has been going to the war zones of Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Tianyong'an to rescue refugees and wounded soldiers with exceptional effort. Over the past five days, they have rescued thousands of refugees from the war zone. The wounded soldiers they rescued have also been sent to hospitals for treatment.

Relief Efforts by the Women's Movement Association

The Women's Movement Promotion Association has been conducting the following activities in recent days: ㊀ The relief group has established a shelter at the Nanyang Wireless School, with supplies provided by the Relief Committee. ㊁ The propaganda group has been going to various streets and alleys, as well as various shelters, to lecture refugees, families, and factory workers on essential knowledge about the war. ㊂ The investigation group has been going to various refugee shelters and wounded soldier hospitals to conduct thorough investigations. ㊃ The fundraising group has received a large quantity of donated gauze, clothing, and food. ㊄ The慰勞 group has been going to the Taihe, Zhongde, Tongde, Baolong, Guangci, and Tongren wounded soldier hospitals to offer comfort and assistance, as well as writing and sending letters home for the wounded soldiers. ㊅ The nursing group has already opened a fifth-level class. The first class has graduated and been assigned to serve in various wounded soldier hospitals. Those who have not yet graduated but have excellent grades have also gone to serve. The seventh class will begin recruiting new students from today onwards. There are still ten vacancies in the sixth class. At the same time, they are still raising money from all walks of life for medicines, soap, rubber, gauze, cotton, mercurochrome, toothbrushes, alcohol, towels, and raincoats, fruit, flashlights, and other items needed by soldiers on the front lines.

Treating Injured and Sick Refugees

The Medical and Pharmaceutical Group of the Municipal Relief Committee issued a notice yesterday stating, "The office of this group has now moved to the second floor of the Pudong Building and is working together. If there are any matters to discuss in the future, please come to that location. In addition to dispatching Chinese and Western medicine doctors daily to various shelters to treat injured and sick refugees and administer vaccinations, this group has established a refugee hospital in the Zhenhua Lane Cotton Cloth Guild on the corner of Bailaini Mengma Road and Laoshenfu Road. An obstetrics department has also been established at the Zhongde Hospital on Fuxu Road. If there are severely injured, seriously ill, or infectious patients, as well as pregnant women in labor, please report to the directors of the various shelters and send them to the aforementioned locations for treatment." Furthermore, the group notes that refugees are gathering in large numbers in various shelters in the city, and many are injured and sick. In light of this, the Relief Committee has sent a special letter to both the Chinese and Western Medicine Associations, requesting that they inform their members to join the Medical and Pharmaceutical Group of the committee and visit various shelters daily to provide care to injured soldiers and refugees, in order to provide universal relief.

Songjiang Shelters 8,000

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, refugees along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, supporting the old and leading the young, have been walking towards Songjiang in an endless stream, a truly pitiable sight. The Songjiang Red Cross Society, noting that the Chaoguo Temple was already housing over 4,000 refugees and could not accommodate any more, Chairman Zhu Jiuwang devised a plan to establish a fourth shelter outside the East Gate, using the Huayan Temple, the former site of Xinyuan Pawnshop, the East Gate Rescue Association, and the East Gate Elementary School to accommodate as many people as possible. Mrs. Qian Xuanqing, supervisor of the association, is responsible for the economy. The number of people sheltered in the two locations totals over 8,000. All medical supplies have been personally brought to Shanghai by Director Zhou Xuewen to be claimed from the general association. There are still over 10,000 people who are being sheltered by Judge Xue Bingzhang of the local court, Lu Shulian, member of the county party committee, and the principal of Yangqiao Elementary School, among others. Cai Zhongyu, chairman of the Fire Fighting Association, is providing assistance.

### Death of Former 19th Route Army General Mao Weishou

Filled with Rage at the Hongqiao Incident, Illness Worsened, Passing Away on the Night of the 16th

Mao Weishou, former commander of the 61st Division of the 19th Route Army and currently a Lieutenant General in the Military Council, led his troops in bloody battles against the brutal enemy during the January 28th Shanghai War, under the command of Generals Cai Tingkai and Jiang Guangnai. His heroic name has long been known, and he was embraced by the people along with Xing Tan, Bai Xiu, and Weng Zhaoyuan. With the opening of the prelude to China's all-out war of resistance, Mao, as a soldier, believed that the time to serve his country and die for it had arrived. Before General Cai Tingkai left Hong Kong, Mao had already arrived first. Unexpectedly, he was severely ill and had to be admitted to Dahua Hospital in West Shanghai for treatment. However, only a few days after being admitted, the Second Shanghai War broke out following the Hongqiao Incident. Mao was filled with rage and could no longer bear it. His worry and indignation aggravated his illness, and medication proved ineffective. He passed away suddenly on the night of the 16th of this month. Mao's remains have been transferred to the China Funeral Home for embalming. Due to the tense situation, the funeral will be held at a later date. All funeral arrangements are currently being handled by Mao's surviving children.

### Citizens Enthusiastically Donate Amidst the National Army's Bloody Battles

Financial Resources Are Essential for the Overall War of Resistance, Silver and Valuables Are Successively Contributed to the Nation, Comfort Items are Transported to the Front Lines in a Busy Manner

With the National Army winning victories in successive battles, people from all walks of life have been sending donations to local associations, requesting them to be forwarded, to the point where the threshold is almost worn through.

A detailed report will be announced in the near future once it is ready. As for comfort items, they are piled up like mountains, and at least five trucks are being transported to the front lines every day. In addition, various other groups, sectors, neighborhoods, and households are also actively donating to contribute their share. Here is a brief record:

Shanghai Silk Industry Bank

In view of the fact that a full-scale war of resistance has begun, the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, in order to strengthen national defense, has decided to present all the commemorative silver shields and other items given by various circles over the years, totaling two large cabinets, to the government. The pure silver portion, weighing over 300 taels, has been sent to Lao Fengxiang Jewelry Store for inventory and transfer. The remaining silver-plated items and other old bronze items, totaling over 200 pieces, will also be sent to the bank in the next few days. Donating glorious mementos to the country is a national initiative. It is hoped that all sectors will follow suit. In addition, the colleagues of the bank have also generously donated comfort funds for the war against the enemy, which may amount to 1,000 yuan.

Residents of Mingde Lane

All the residents of Mingde Lane on Fuxu Road in the French Concession have spontaneously launched a fundraising campaign to help the soldiers fighting against the enemy. The residents, tenants, men, women, servants, and maids have all generously donated. A certain female entertainer even donated her gold ring. The atmosphere was enthusiastic. The total amount raised yesterday was 608 yuan, 3 jiao, and 5 fen, which has been sent to the Dagong Newspaper for collection. It is hoped that other tenants in various lanes will continue to raise funds to increase the strength of the resistance against the enemy.

National Medical and Pharmaceutical Groups

In addition to organizing a Chinese medicine rescue team to serve the front lines and various shelters in the rear, the Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical groups in the city announced in the newspaper a few days ago that all Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical colleagues in the city should send their gold and silver jewelry and coins to the designated collection points of the support association in major newspapers to receive receipts and report to the association for statistics. According to reports from Zhu Nanshan and Xiao Nanhegao, a total of 100 taels of silver and 100 yuan in silver dollars were donated, with 56 taels of silver shields, as the first initiative. It is hoped that colleagues will continue to actively donate.

Residents of Mingxia Village

The residents of Mingxia Village on Ladu Road in the Second Special District, seeing that our loyal and patriotic soldiers are fighting bloody battles to eliminate the powerful invaders, spontaneously raised 44 yuan, which was handed over to this publication yesterday for collection and transfer in order to fulfill the duty of the people in the rear. It is reported that there are only a dozen households in the village, and apart from three or four of them who did not donate a single cent despite being relatively well-off, the rest, including female servants and rickshaw pullers, all contributed their hard-earned money, which is particularly commendable.

Broadcast Fundraising Numbers

The Shanghai Entertainment Industry National Salvation Association raised a total of 8,814 yuan and 5 jiao in national currency from fundraising for national salvation at the Zhongxi and Huadong radio stations on the 13th and 14th of this month.

We hope you will restrain your grief and join together to overcome the national crisis. Sincerely, the Anti-Enemy Support Association of All Circles in Shanghai."

### Japanese Nationals Withdraw

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, Japanese nationals have been concentrated in the Shenjiawan and Penglu areas. With the National Army winning victories in successive battles, the enemy's defense area has been shrinking, and the area has become an absolutely dangerous zone. In addition, with the effectiveness of our army's artillery fire and the activity of the air force, the Japanese nationals are in a state of extreme panic and began to withdraw the night before last. As of last night, almost all of them had boarded ships, appearing quite disheveled.

### Traitor Tao Jinrong Warned

Youth Mistakenly Assaulted, Acquitted in Court

On the afternoon of the 17th, a youth suddenly went to the open space of the Tao Shunji wooden box factory at No. 701, Lane 391, Haifang Road, and placed a bomb and scattered dozens of leaflets. The headline on the leaflets was "Punish Traitor Tao Jinrong," signed "Anti-Enemy Extermination." The content described how Tao Jinrong sold yellow sand, stones, reed mats, and wooden boxes to aid the enemy. People in the factory seized the youth and accused him of being a traitor. Misunderstanding, nearby citizens joined in beating him. Fortunately, detectives arrived and dispersed the crowd, taking him back to the Gordon Road police station. He was not seriously injured. The youth confessed that his name was Shen Anlin and that he warned Tao Jinrong because Tao Jinrong bought yellow sand, stones, reed mats, and wooden boxes for the Japanese merchant Mi Ze Yanghang to supply the enemy command for construction work, in order to awaken him. The police charged him with obstructing freedom under criminal law and sent him to the First Special District Court. On the morning of the 18th, Judge Xiao opened the Third Criminal Court for investigation. The plaintiff, defendant, police lawyer Zhang Yaoming, and defendant's defense lawyer Zhu Yakui were present. First, the police lawyer stated the prosecution's intentions, then inquired about the defendant's name, age, origin, occupation, address, and the details of the incident, and also questioned the plaintiff Tao Jinrong. It was claimed that he had indeed sold wooden boxes to the Japanese merchant Mi Ze Yanghang in the past, about 3,000 to 4,000 yuan per month. Now he asked the court to release the defendant. The judge declared that the case was not accepted because the plaintiff withdrew the complaint. Shen Anlin was acquitted and released at that time.

### Traitors Executed

The South City executed three traitors in various places the day before yesterday after finding them to be true. They were executed at dawn yesterday. Four traitors went to the Nanchang, Malu, and Dongfengjialou areas to draw maps. The villagers caught them and sent them to Nanchang. One of them was executed on the spot because the evidence was conclusive, and the other three were sent to the county for investigation.

### Though Numerous, Traitors Cannot Escape Death

Civilian Sanctions, Impossible to Hide

Recently, traitors have been extremely active in this city, probing for information everywhere. According to the news from the Prosecutor's Office of the First Special Court yesterday morning, the number of traitors discovered and beaten to death by our citizens is as follows: ㊀ One died on Robertson Road. ㊁ Two died on Ma Bai Road, one was Yu Fubo, a local resident living on Tokyo Road (at that time, Zhou was wearing a Japanese-style monk's hat, and a citizen named Zheng Busong was arrested and detained by the police), and the other was a man of unknown name and about 42 years old. ㊂ Liu Hanchen, 36 years old, was beaten to death by the crowd. ㊃ One man resembling a Portuguese, about 40 years old, was recognized by the crowd as a Japanese at the intersection of Fujian Road and Beijing Road and was stoned to death. ㊄ Yesterday afternoon at 3:30, two Chinese men resembling Koreans, one about 30 years old and one about 25 years old, were killed by the crowd. ㊅ Yesterday morning at 10:00, a traitor about 26 years old was beaten to death at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Chengdu Road, and they were all buried separately. Yesterday morning at 10:00, an unknown man about 40 years old wearing a xiangyunsha short shirt and trousers, had traitorous behavior in front of Chongyi Fang at the intersection of Malang Road and Laoshifu Road in the French Concession. Passersby discovered and questioned him, which immediately attracted onlookers. The crowd was outraged and beat the man. With one voice, they picked the man up and threw him hard to the ground (commonly known as "pai san he tu," or "push three with dirt"). The man died instantly, and the beaters dispersed in a rush. Patrolmen saw this and reported it to the French police station in charge, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan branch for examination and will be reported to the Second Special Court today to send personnel for inspection.

### Medical Association Distributes Poison Gas Prevention and First Aid Knowledge

In this emergency, the Shanghai Medical Association has prepared seven poison gas prevention tips and six first aid tips to disseminate poison gas prevention and emergency first aid knowledge to the public so that they can know the general outline of this knowledge and not be at a loss in times of crisis. The transcript is as follows:

Poison Gas Prevention Knowledge

(1) Poison gas can be released by: ㊀ Gas cylinders, ㊁ Projectile tubes, ㊂ Cannons, ㊃ Aircraft. Aircraft release is now generally used.

(2) Types of poison gas include: ㊀ Suffocating gas, ㊁ Lachrymatory gas, ㊂ Sternutatory gas, ㊃ Vesicant gas, ㊄ Toxic gas.

Suffocating gases include: ㊀ Chlorine, ㊁ Phosgene, ㊂ Diphosgene, etc.

Lachrymatory gases include: ㊀ Bromoacetone, ㊁ Bromomethyl ethyl ether, ㊂ Chloroacetone, ㊃ Picryl chloride, etc.

Sternutatory gases include: ㊀ Diphenylchloroarsine, ㊁ Phenylarsine dichloride, ㊂ Adamsite, ㊃ Chloroarsine, ㊄ Dibromoethylarsine, etc.

Vesicant gases include: ㊀ Mustard gas, ㊁ Lewisite.

Toxic gases include: ㊀ Hydrocyanic acid, ㊁ Bromoacetone, etc.

(3) For personal poison gas prevention, you can purchase a specially made mask, which costs about 13 yuan at the current price.

(4) For simple poison gas prevention, use dozens of layers of cotton gauze, with twenty layers soaked in urotropine (8.17%), ten layers soaked in sodium thiosulfate (24.0%) and sodium hydroxide (6.54%), and ten layers soaked in a mixture of castor oil, alcohol, and glycerin, covering the mouth and nose.

(5) To prevent vesicant gas, the whole body must be protected. 60% castorial oil ointment can be applied to the skin. In an emergency, thick application of cooked lard to the skin is also possible.

(6) If vesicant gas has adhered to the skin, dry bleaching powder can be applied. The same applies to clothing and utensils contaminated with this gas.

(7) For public poison gas prevention, a poison gas shelter must be built. The entrances and exits of the shelter must be covered with poison gas-proof curtains (these curtains are made in the same way as the masks in point four; each large room can accommodate 40 to 50 people, and the room must be airtight, or a special poison gas filter box can be used to import air from the outside, or compressed oxygen can be slowly released).

First Aid Knowledge

(1) In the event of injury from knives, guns, bullets, bombs, house collapses, burns, etc., in nine out of ten cases, the skin is broken and bleeding occurs, so the public must have emergency first aid knowledge (that is, disinfection and hemostasis).

(2) For disinfection methods, microorganisms can invade after the skin is broken. If the wound becomes infected, it can be life-threatening. Therefore, immediately after the injury, iodine or mercurochrome should be applied, then wrapped in gauze and cotton and sent to a suitable hospital or doctor for treatment.

(3) Bleeding is a very dangerous phenomenon and must be stopped immediately. If bleeding occurs in the upper limb, raise the injured person's hand upwards and tie the injured person's upper arm tightly with a bandage or coarse cloth, closer to the shoulder. The tighter the better, the blood can be temporarily stopped (the degree of tightening is limited to the point where the pulse cannot be felt). If bleeding occurs in the lower limb, have the injured person lie flat, raise their foot high upwards, and tie the upper part of the thigh tightly with a bandage or cloth to stop the bleeding (but must be sent to a hospital or doctor within two hours).

(4) In the event of a burn, oil, fat oil, or pus tea juice can be applied to the wound, then gently wrapped in gauze and bandages and sent to a hospital or doctor for treatment.

(5) First aid for someone who has been electrocuted: Because the current passes through the human body, causing numbness in mild cases and blackened and charred skin in severe cases, and even endangering life. For first aid, first get them away from the power line. The power switch can be quickly turned off. If someone touches the power grid, use a wooden stick to push the electrocuted person away (do not use iron objects).

(6) If an injured person has a fracture, do not move it. Straighten and fix it along the original shape of the arm or leg bone, clamp it with a wooden board or cardboard, wrap it with bandages, and then send it to the hospital.

In times of emergency, everyone must prepare gauze, cotton, bandages, rubber plasters, iodine, or a small bottle of red medicine, pack them in a small bag, and prepare one for each person, which can be used for self-help and to save others.

### Fire Alarm on North Henan Road Last Night

At 10:54 PM last night, a house at a certain address on North Henan Road near Haining Road suddenly caught fire due to carelessness. The Fire Brigade arrived at the scene after receiving the alarm and tried their best to extinguish the blaze. It took approximately two hours to bring the fire under control. It is rumored that the fire was caused by enemy aircraft dropping incendiary bombs.

### HSBC Bank to Reopen at Original Location Today

The British-owned HSBC Bank, due to its proximity to the Huangpu River, had moved to the manager's residence at 2188 Jing'an Temple Road on the 17th for business operations. Since then, work has been unusually busy. For the sake of operational convenience, it is reported that the bank will resume operations at its original location on the Bund starting today.

### No Anti-Aircraft Guns Found on Bank Roofs After Two-Day Investigation

It was previously rumored that the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Bank of Taiwan in this city had installed anti-aircraft guns on their roofs. Currently, the police have dispatched personnel to investigate and have confirmed that there are no anti-aircraft guns on the roofs of either bank.

### Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Tracks to be Repaired and Reopened Today

Around 3 PM yesterday, enemy aircraft bombed the No. 31 and No. 34 railway bridges of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, only damaging the tracks in a few places. The power lines and poles in that area were also slightly damaged. The railway authorities have already sent personnel to repair the damage and the line should be restored to normal operation today.

### Western Newspapers Temporarily Reduce Size

The Shanghai-based North-China Daily News usually publishes four or four-and-a-half large sheets daily. Yesterday, due to the suspension of gas supply in anticipation of continued air raids, it was reduced to one large sheet. Other English newspapers are also only publishing one-and-a-half sheets. This is unprecedented.

### Patriotic Citizens Urged to Quickly Purchase National Salvation Bonds

End the War, Repay in Installments

In order to raise sufficient funds through donations from patriotic citizens, the National Government is issuing National Salvation Bonds worth 500 million yuan. After the war ends, the bonds will be repaid in installments. At this time of comprehensive resistance, when soldiers are giving their lives, this measure provides us with the most effective opportunity to serve the country. It is hoped that all our citizens will enthusiastically purchase the bonds to benefit military needs. The future of resistance depends on this.

### Public Donations of Urgently Needed Supplies for Wounded Soldiers

The person in charge of the wounded soldiers' hospital has telephoned this newspaper requesting urgently needed replacement clothing for the wounded soldiers. They also stated that there is an extreme shortage of "anti-tetanus serum" medicine for treating the wounded soldiers. It is hoped that all sectors of society will quickly donate and send supplies to Dr. Huang Linsheng at the Red Cross First Hospital on Avenue Haig, Shanghai.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's meteorological forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: The Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and downstream of the Yangtze River will be cloudy to clear. The southeast wind will shift from moderate to strong. The upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River will be clear with variable wind direction. The hurricane near Yap is still moving northwest-west. The hurricane center at 2 PM was within approximately 120 miles of 14 degrees North latitude and 140 degrees East longitude. Wind force is unknown. Also, the highest temperature in this city in the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday was 92.5 degrees, and the lowest was 74.8 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 94.3 degrees and the lowest was 75.9 degrees.

### Letters to the Editor

To the Editor,

I, the undersigned, on behalf of the owner of the Xie Da Rice Store, declare that I was extremely shocked to read the news in the Shen Bao on the 16th of this month, which stated that "Xie Da Rice Store is supplying the enemy with grain." This store, located at 102 Avenue Bédier, has been in business for years and has always adhered to the duties of a merchant. We dare not lag behind others in loving our country. On the 15th of this month, due to a misunderstanding in the purchase of rice, someone fabricated facts and made arbitrary accusations. It is regrettable that outsiders are unaware of this. Since the outbreak of the war in this city, the French Municipal Council has implemented measures to regulate food supplies by limiting the price of rice purchases. On the 14th of this month, the French Municipal Council sent personnel to check the rice inventory of this store, and we were verbally instructed to sell rice at a price not exceeding one yuan. All other businesses in the vicinity are operating in the same manner. The facts are clear and easily verifiable. As for the incident on the 15th, Mr. Chen Mingyang and Mr. Zhu Yiqian had each placed orders for several piculs of rice with this store several days prior. At that time, this store, due to a shortage of manpower and an excessive number of purchasers, was unable to deliver the rice. It was not until the 15th that the two gentlemen came one after another with their own vehicles to load the rice. Unexpectedly, the crowd, unaware of the situation, falsely accused us of supplying the enemy. Mr. Chen resides at 6 Rue de Courbet, and his car registration number is 11565. Mr. Zhu resides at 16 Tongxingfang, Rue Mère Mathilde, and his car registration number is 8501. Based on the two gentlemen's addresses and car registration numbers, it is not difficult to investigate the truth. All the details reported in the newspaper are based on rumors and are inaccurate. Accordingly, I have been entrusted to write to the newspaper for clarification in order to clarify the facts and protect the legal rights of merchants. Your prompt rectification will be deeply appreciated. To Mr. Editor of the Shen Bao, Lawyer Yuan Jingtang, August 16th.

To the Editor,

I have recently seen the report in your newspaper on the 16th concerning the situation of rice stores, in which it was mentioned that our store was fined by the police station for raising rice prices. This is not in accordance with the facts and is probably based on inaccurate rumors. I am writing this special letter to correct this. To the editors of the Shen Bao, Yonghengchang Store, 2074 Avenue Haig, August 17th.

Dear Editor,

Unfortunately, my younger sister has been missing since the Shanghai battle. Since she lives in the Chinese area and has no money on her person, her current situation is unknown. Due to our fellowship in the same industry, I implore you, sir, to show kindness and publish the six characters "Litian seeks Jinhua" free of charge in your newspaper, in the hope that siblings can be reunited.
