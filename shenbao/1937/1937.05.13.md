### Amendment of New Salt Law Under Discussion

[Nanjing] The Central Political Council has successively submitted the amendment of Articles 24 and 25 of the New Salt Law, as well as the proposal to determine the national salt district tax rate table, to the Legislative Yuan for review. The Legislative Yuan has now submitted them to the Finance and Legal System Committees for review. Article 24 of the New Salt Law stipulates that salt tax should be levied at a uniform rate of 5 yuan in national currency per 100 kilograms, and no additional taxes or surcharges are allowed. Article 25 stipulates that the tax on fishing salt should be 3 jiao in national currency per 100 kilograms. It is now proposed to amend Article 4, taking into account the current situation of salt tax revenue, to state that the salt tax should not exceed 5 yuan in national currency per 100 "shi jin" (a unit of weight), and the tax rate table will be determined separately. Article 25 will be amended only to change "kilograms" to "shi jin" in accordance with Article 4.

### Sichuan Province Requests Issuance of Disaster Relief Bonds

Ministry of Finance Responds Again That the Method is Unsuitable

[Nanjing] Regarding the case of the Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, Liu Xiang, previously requesting the issuance of 15 million yuan in disaster relief bonds, due to the unsuitable method of raising funds, he has telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance again, proposing to change the issuance to 12 million yuan in Sichuan Province disaster relief bonds, with an annual interest rate of 6%, to be repaid in 15 years, starting from the 27th year, adding 20% to the land tax in Sichuan as a fund. The principal and interest payments will be handled according to the method of the 25th year's Sichuan Financial Consolidation and Aftermath Bonds. As land taxes have already been reduced in the 26th year due to the severe drought, it is not convenient to collect additional taxes. It is proposed that the 1,248,000 yuan in funds for the 26th year be subsidized by the national treasury. Currently, the Ministry of Finance believes that Chairman Liu's method is still unsuitable and has telegraphed back, saying, "Chairman Liu of Chengdu: Your telegram of the 1st has been read. Regarding your April 17 telegram requesting the issuance of 15 million yuan in Sichuan Province disaster relief bonds, this Ministry replied in the telegram of the 27th, based on the method presented by Director Liu. However, the telegram of the 1st from Director Liu is consistent with Director Liu's presentation. Other aspects, such as the repayment period, the annual amount of principal and interest to be paid, the method of raising funds, and the use of the bonds, are all different from Director Liu's presentation. Since the disaster in Sichuan is so severe, it is not appropriate to raise funds by adding to the land tax, which conflicts with the National Government's decree of June 8, 23, which prohibits adding additional land taxes. Even if the method proposed in your telegram is submitted, the Central Political Council and the Legislative Yuan may not immediately approve it. It is hoped that you will inquire in detail with Director Liu and develop a proper plan, and submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval after completing the procedures for issuing bonds. Respectfully replied, seal of the Ministry of Finance." It is also heard that the Ministry of Finance will separately submit the handling of this case to the Executive Yuan for review. The memorandum also stated that the Sichuan disaster is so severe that requesting the issuance of bonds by adding to the land tax, even if it is delayed until the 27th year, would likely be too much for the people to bear and would likely cause dissatisfaction. The use of these bonds and the implementation methods for disaster prevention and relief have not been explained in detail. Other aspects, such as the repayment period of the bonds and the annual amount of principal and interest to be paid, also differ from Director Liu's presentation. The Ministry has telegraphed Chairman Liu, urging him to develop a proper plan as soon as possible and submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval after completing the procedures for issuing bonds.

### Judicial Yuan Interprets Doubts

Revoking Cases of Official Property Acquisition

[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan previously requested the Judicial Yuan to interpret legal ambiguities regarding the revocation of official property acquisition cases based on the request of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. The Judicial Yuan has now responded that for official property and land released by administrative agencies based on their authority, the ownership has been transferred to the acquirer, and the administrative agency cannot arbitrarily change it. However, if it is discovered that the property should not belong to private individuals according to laws and regulations (such as historical sites), the higher-level agency can revoke it in the exercise of its supervisory power. If the property is indeed private property, and the administrative agency mistakenly released it as official property, the original owner can file a civil lawsuit with the judicial authorities and also file an administrative appeal. Before this appeal, the higher-level agency can directly revoke it. The Executive Yuan has now issued an order to inform and instruct. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Principles for Appointing County Magistrates

[Nanjing] The principles for appointing county magistrates have been amended and approved by the Central Political Committee on the 12th. The five items are recorded below in their original text:

㊀ Those who are over 30 years old and have passed the county magistrate examination according to law should be given priority for appointment. In addition, those who possess one of the legal qualifications, having been thoroughly assessed by the civil affairs department of each province regarding their talent, character, knowledge, experience, and physical condition, and deemed competent to serve as county magistrates, shall be reported by the chairmen of the provincial governments to the Ministry of Interior, which will forward the report to the Ministry of Personnel for review. Those who pass the review shall be recorded as county magistrate candidates. The assessment methods shall be determined by the Examination Yuan. Those who possess one of the legal qualifications may be recommended by the administrative departments under the Executive Yuan if deemed necessary, after thorough assessment by the Ministry of Interior and review by the Ministry of Personnel. Those who pass the review shall be recorded as county magistrate candidates. (Explanation: The current qualifications for county magistrate appointment are based on three regulations: 1. "Regulations for the Appointment of County Magistrates," 2. "Regulations for the Appointment of Civil Servants," and 3. "Provisional Measures for Restricting the Appointment of County Magistrates in Bandit Suppression Areas." The coexistence of these three laws creates inconsistencies, which is not in line with the principle of unified personnel management. The reason why the Regulations for the Appointment of County Magistrates cannot be unified is that the original law's qualification restrictions are excessive, and it is difficult to standardize the qualifications of county magistrates in various provinces. As a result, the Regulations for the Appointment of County Magistrates have not been fully implemented, and various remedial measures have been introduced. In order to unify regulations and consider the actual situation, the qualifications stipulated in the previous three regulations, which differ in their stringency, are consolidated into one law. Furthermore, administrative experience, performance, and research conditions are added to attract talent that matches the requirements. Moreover, since the district chiefs who serve in various provinces and districts have heavy responsibilities and complicated tasks, it is difficult for mediocre individuals to handle the job, and the low pay makes it difficult to attract talent. In order to encourage virtuous and capable individuals to serve at the grassroots level and improve the efficiency of district administration, it is stipulated that such district chiefs may be promoted to county magistrates, so that district chiefs who serve the people wholeheartedly may have a path for promotion. In addition, the civil affairs directors of the provincial governments are specifically responsible for identifying county magistrate talent. The assessment is a public way to seek talent, and the recommendation is a responsible way to promote the virtuous, so as to avoid casual recommendations and improve the quality of county magistrate candidates. The assessment methods are stipulated to be determined by the Examination Yuan to create uniform methods for all provinces to follow the law and avoid disputes. Furthermore, the Executive Yuan oversees all national administrative affairs, and due to the implementation of national policies, it needs special talent. For county magistrate candidates who need to be recommended by subordinate agencies, the Executive Yuan may designate them to handle the matter, so as to broadly recruit and respond to the situation.

㊀ If any province has individuals who are of sufficient legal age, possess both talent and virtue, and have administrative knowledge and experience, the chairman of the provincial government may specially recommend them to the Ministry of Interior, and after passing the examination and inquiry by the Examination Yuan, they shall be recorded by the Ministry of Personnel as county magistrate candidates. (Explanation: The stipulation of qualifications is to prevent abuse, but qualification restrictions sometimes hinder the advancement of special virtuous and capable individuals. Currently, there are county magistrates in various provinces who have been appointed by the provincial governments and are competent in their duties, but some outstanding individuals may have difficulty meeting the qualifications. Furthermore, some may be constrained by their qualifications and unable to be appointed. According to the national principle of employing people, if there is noncompliance, it is difficult for the laws to be effectively implemented. Therefore, this draft law has special recommendation provisions to ensure the smooth progress of county administration in various provinces and prevent true talent from being buried. The provincial government must obtain approval from both ministries before making the recommendation, and the candidate must pass the examination and inquiry by the Examination Yuan to prevent abuse.

㊀ All personnel who obtain county magistrate qualifications in accordance with this law must first undergo unified training by the Ministry of Interior before being assigned for appointment. (Explanation: County magistrates are responsible for the actual implementation of national laws and regulations. They must fully understand the spirit of the central government's policies and the intentions of the central administrative leaders in order to faithfully implement them and unify the people's views and achieve the practical effect of national unity. This draft law stipulates that county magistrate candidates must undergo unified training by the Ministry of Interior so that county magistrates are not merely central government officials in form but are also molded by the central government in substance. Once assigned to local areas, they can uphold the central government's policies and be loyal to their duties. The Ministry of Interior is in charge of national civil affairs training and should be responsible for it to unify authority.

㊀ All county magistrates who have been assigned for candidacy, if they do not have more than one year of experience in administrative positions, must first serve as secretaries, section chiefs, bureau chiefs, or district chiefs in the assigned province for one year of internship. Only those who have excellent performance in the provincial government's assessment after the internship period can be formally appointed. County magistrate candidates who are interning, if due to special circumstances, cannot complete the internship or the internship period is not fulfilled, and the provincial government records it as reducible or waivable and consults the Ministry of Interior for approval and forwards it to the Ministry of Personnel for record, the internship period may be reduced or waived. (Explanation: County magistrates are officials who are close to the people and responsible for implementing government policies, so administrative experience is indispensable. Even if they have qualifications and have received training, they may still encounter difficulties or make oversights when dealing with complex matters, and they may not be familiar with the people's feelings. It will be difficult to avoid mistakes, let alone achieve merits. Therefore, this draft law stipulates that they should first serve as county magistrate secretaries, section chiefs, bureau chiefs, or district chiefs to gain experience. These positions are closely related to county administration and are under the guidance and supervision of the county magistrate, so as not to cause problems due to lack of experience. If they can gain experience and achieve results in the above positions, they will be more confident in assuming the post of county magistrate. This is to cultivate talent in the appointment process. Furthermore, if the provincial government needs personnel to fill vacancies for county magistrates, or after strict investigation, believes that the county magistrate candidate does not need to intern, the internship period may also be reduced or waived if there are sufficient reasons. This is to emphasize the authority and responsibility of the provincial government, and the consultation with the Ministry of Interior for approval and forwarding to the Ministry of Personnel for record is to prevent harm and emphasize performance appraisal.

㊀ Current personnel in central government agencies who have the qualifications to be county magistrate candidates as stipulated in this law may be mutually transferred with current county magistrates legally appointed by various provinces. (Explanation: In recent years, central and local administration has often lacked coordination, which has affected the consistent implementation of administrative policies. In order to communicate political situations and eliminate barriers, this draft law stipulates the principle of mutual transfer of central and local government personnel to recruit talent and coordinate internal and external affairs. In addition, the resolution on the principle of selecting county mayors and magistrates in Beijing from the national personnel examination meeting in the 23rd year has been approved by the conference, and the Ministry of Personnel has drafted a proposal based on the principles and sent it to the central government for approval and submission to the Legislative Yuan for review. Therefore, taking advantage of the revision of the regulations for the appointment of county magistrates, the spirit of the proposal is incorporated. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)

Current Affairs Commentary

### Eliminating the Problem of Smuggling

— Yu

Mr. F.W. Maze, Inspector General of the Chinese Maritime Customs, made a statement on the smuggling problem in London yesterday. He said, "Although the anti-smuggling work of the Tianjin Customs has improved slightly recently, the gateway to eastern Hebei has not been strictly guarded. As far as an effective anti-smuggling plan is concerned, the status of the Tianjin Customs has not improved. Unless China's sovereignty in the non-garrison area is effectively restored, and the customs anti-smuggling team can exercise its ordinary duties, the status of the customs may not be improved. In other words, the customs anti-smuggling duties can only be carried out as usual after the armed maritime patrol boats and shore anti-smuggling teams are restored."

At this time of rampant smuggling, it must be said that it is very meaningful for F.W. Maze, who is responsible for the important duties of customs, to frankly put forward the fundamental way to eliminate smuggled goods. F.W. Maze is British. British and Japanese diplomats are also talking about the Chinese issue these days. We hope that those British gentlemen who echo Japan's proposal to reduce Chinese tariffs will think more about what this fellow countryman who has served in China for many years said. Without eradicating the root of smuggling, smuggled goods will never be eliminated, and the harm of smuggling can never be prevented by reducing tariffs.

The clearest sentences in F.W. Maze's speech are: "The customs anti-smuggling duties can only be carried out as usual after the armed maritime patrol boats and shore anti-smuggling teams are restored." The two declarations that the anti-smuggling personnel of the Jianghai Customs have successively issued can just supplement this point. They are willing to fight, and they are willing to sacrifice. However, they are not armed. Empty-handedness cannot ultimately beat iron rulers, wooden sticks, and short guns, or even live ammunition pistols.

So how to restore the arming of anti-smuggling personnel? As F.W. Maze said, "Unless China's sovereignty in the non-garrison area is effectively restored, the customs anti-smuggling team can exercise its ordinary duties, the status of the customs may not be improved." We can thoroughly understand that to restore the power of customs officers to be armed and implement anti-smuggling, we must recover the seized territory and sovereignty. For example, to eliminate smuggling in Shanghai, we must restore China's sovereignty on the Shanghai docks. To eliminate smuggling in North China, we must first recover eastern Hebei, the base camp of smuggling, and then recover the Northeast, the rear camp of smuggling.

Regarding the issue of abolishing the puppet organization in eastern Hebei, there have been recent rumors of negotiations. Of course, these rumors are nothing more than a smokescreen. If, as a result of negotiations, eastern Hebei abolishes the existing puppet organization but in reality still cannot get rid of the special zone, then eastern Hebei must still be a paradise for smuggling vagrants. We must never tolerate such a state. What we demand is the effective restoration of sovereignty and the effective recovery of territory. In this way, smuggling and all issues between China and Japan can be completely resolved.

Of course, we are not advocating that, in addition to striving for these fundamental points, we can give up all other work. Before the territory and sovereignty are truly recovered, "rejecting smuggling" is also a necessary task to be effectively implemented. Students in Peiping and Tianjin have now launched a "Reject Smuggling Alliance." We hope that people across the country will rise up to respond and block the way out for smuggled goods.

### London Becomes the Center of World Politics

Eden is very busy with diplomatic maneuvers, and his talks with Russia and Poland are particularly noteworthy.

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden is very busy with diplomatic maneuvers and holding talks with the foreign ministers of various countries who are currently here to attend the coronation ceremony. In particular, Eden's talks with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, and French Foreign Minister Delbos are attracting the attention of the general public. Colonel Beck held talks with Foreign Secretary Eden in the office of the Polish Ambassador Count Rytas after the Polish ambassador's banquet this afternoon. The talks lasted for a long time. It is reported that Colonel Beck explained Poland's current stance on Germany and Russia and pointed out that Poland is now planning to follow the example of Belgium and declare neutrality. If this can be done, Poland will prepare to submit it to the league. It is also reported that Poland has now decided to stay out of international disputes, so it is unwilling to hear about the Austro-Hungarian incident and will stop negotiations with Romania. (Note: Colonel Beck recently visited Romania and held talks with the country's authorities.) Eden agreed with Beck to continue their meeting by the end of this week, around the 14th of this month. Colonel Beck then went to the French Embassy to meet with French Foreign Minister Delbos, and the same issue was discussed. They also discussed the meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council and the Provisional Assembly in Geneva at the end of this month. Finally, Beck went to Buckingham Palace to visit Prince Paul, the first regent of Yugoslavia, to discuss business issues between the two countries. On the other hand, Foreign Secretary Eden met with Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov at the Foreign Office. It is generally known that Litvinov raised the issue of the situation in Spain and the work of the Non-Intervention Committee, and insisted that Italy and Germany should be prevented from supplying aircraft to the Spanish Nationalist Army again. Foreign Secretary Eden believes that the civil war in Spain should be resolved as soon as possible and has reportedly stated to Litvinov that France and Russia should issue a joint declaration again to explain that the mutual assistance pact between France and Russia is not intended to deal with Germany, so as to ease Germany's uneasiness and allow the country to participate in the future Western European pact. Foreign Secretary Eden then met with German Foreign Minister Schmidt and continued talks on the issue of economic cooperation among the countries in the Danube River basin. In the evening, Foreign Secretary Eden attended a banquet at the French Embassy, and after the banquet, he held talks with the French Foreign Minister together with Foreign Secretary Sir Vansittart. It is reported that Eden insisted that the British government is determined to continue negotiations on the Western European pact, and with regard to the investigation work carried out by Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland (referring to the investigation work on removing obstacles to international trade), he said that after the investigation has yielded results, Britain will seriously consider it.

### It is rumored that Japan recognizes the rebel government of Western countries

Tokyo authorities firmly deny it.

Lisbon According to the radio broadcast by Salamon today, Japan has recognized the Spanish Nationalist Army government led by General Franco. Personnel from Japan with diplomatic and commercial missions are currently waiting in Salamanca. It is reported that only Germany and Italy have recognized the Franco government in addition to Japan. (Reuters dispatch on the 12th by Central News Agency)

[Tokyo] The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently firmly denied the rumors that Japan has recognized the Spanish Franco government with the condition that the government must sign a commercial treaty. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also denied the Tokyo news reported by France that some parties believed that General Franco and the Japanese Army were conducting secret negotiations, and said that the French rumors that the Japanese Army was eager to recognize the Franco government in order to obtain raw materials needed for manufacturing military equipment were also absurd and baseless.

### Mixed Battles on All Fronts in Spain

Government troops besiege Toledo, and Madrid continues to be bombarded.

Hengtai According to border news, there were fierce battles on four fronts in Spain tonight, with countless casualties. Rebel troops bombarded Madrid, killing 60 and injuring 130. Basque troops launched a counterattack in the dark and rain, and drove back General Mullah's Ler army, recapturing all the important points of Mount Solov. Toledo is said to have been breached by government troops and is currently in street fighting. In the Guadarrama area, both sides bombed the enemy's rear with aircraft. According to reports from various parties, the government troops have won many victories, but the bulletins issued by the rebel troops are the opposite. (National Electricity on the 12th)

Guernica The Nationalist troops yesterday used artillery and aircraft to bombard fiercely on the Basque front, and after another attack, they immediately occupied all the positions in the Viscargüez mountain area and controlled the Laiarabecha and Gardagano river basins. The Gardagano River is the center of the defense works of the port of Bilbao, and its importance is evident. The military affairs of the Nationalist troops on the Basque front are personally commanded by General Mullah, the commander of the Northern Route. As a result of the fierce fighting in recent days, the government troops have suffered heavy casualties. It is reported that more than 1,000 people have died and about 2,500 people have been injured. (Havas dispatch on the 12th by Central News Agency)

Madrid More than 100 large-caliber shells were fired from the dark artillery positions on the Spanish Nationalist Army's front line, most of which landed in the city of Madrid, but some of the high-rise buildings in the suburbs were destroyed by the shells. All the houses in the Gran Vía area were destroyed. When the shelling occurred, the residents of the city of Madrid panicked and took refuge in basements or underground stations. All the trams were stopped. The intensity of this shelling was unprecedented, killing 40 people and injuring more than 150 people. (Reuters dispatch on the 12th by Central News Agency)

### Japanese Political Parties Move to the Cabinet

The cooperation between the Zhengmin parties is gradually becoming concrete.

[Tokyo] The Minseito Party held a members' meeting on the 7th, and the Seiyukai Party held a members' meeting on the 11th, and formally decided on a policy of overthrowing the current cabinet, and resolved to cooperate with the public to realize a unified national cabinet to implement reform policies and overcome the difficulties of the times. In order to achieve this month's goal, the two parties plan to start with the work of political and public cooperation, that is, Minseito Party representative Koizumi and Seiyukai representative Matsuno are scheduled to contact various matters in the next day or two, and schedule a formal meeting between the leaders of the two parties to discuss the specific method of overthrowing the current cabinet, and hold a joint friendship conference between the members of the two parties at an appropriate time and jointly declare the overthrow of the cabinet to arouse national opinion. (Domei dispatch on the 12th)

### Russian Deputy Defense Commissar Transferred to Another Post

Equivalent to Exile

[Paris] Regarding the transfer of Soviet Deputy People's Commissar of Defense, General Tukhachevsky, to the post of commander of the Volga Military District, the Moscow correspondent of the "Petit Parisien" newspaper recently declared that Tukhachevsky and People's Commissar of Defense Voroshilov were both promoted to the rank of general ten months ago, seemingly trusted by the dictator Stalin. However, recently, his adjutant, Smudny, plotted to harm Stalin but was not detected in time. Moreover, because Tukhachevsky came from nobility and his ambition was said to rival that of Napoleon I, he aroused suspicion and was demoted to an idle position, which is practically equivalent to exile in a remote area. Furthermore, according to news from Berlin, German political figures also regard this move as an exile, which is clear evidence that the Soviet government intends to place the country's army under political control.

### US Congressman Proposes Convening International Conference

Regarding this proposal, it is rumored that President Roosevelt will consider it after returning to Washington from his southern vacation. (Central News Agency, 11th, Havas dispatch)

[London] The coronation ceremony of King George VI of England began at eleven o'clock this morning. All the magnificent medieval rituals and traditional formalities of past dynasties reappeared in this coronation of the thirty-eighth English King after William the Conqueror. Nobles from across the British Empire and representatives from forty countries around the world, a total of six thousand dignitaries, were able to personally participate in the grand event and quietly observe the solemn ceremony. (National Maritime Telegraph, 12th dispatch)

[London] King George VI of England held a solemn and respectful coronation ceremony at 12:31 this noon in Westminster Abbey, under the watchful eyes of representatives from all countries around the world. The Archbishop of Canterbury presided over the grand coronation ceremony. Cannons boomed at St. James's Palace and Hyde Park, and the bells of Westminster rang loudly, arousing the whole country to celebrate together. After the coronation ceremony of the English King was completed, the English Queen was then crowned, and the ceremony was also conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury.

The weather that day was overcast with dark clouds, and there was a possibility of continued rain. Fortunately, the rain did not fall until after the King and Queen returned to the palace. The coronation ceremony in Westminster Abbey ended at 2:00 PM. The King and Queen departed from Buckingham Palace at 10:33 AM and did not return to the palace until 4:04 PM, a difference of five and a half hours. When the King and Queen's carriage returned to the palace, heavy rain poured down just as the carriage entered the front courtyard. However, the enthusiasm of the crowds outside the palace did not diminish at all. (Central News Agency, 12th, Reuters dispatch)

### Crowds Blocked the Streets

[London] The areas through which the King George VI coronation procession passed were closed to traffic from midnight last night. A large number of tourists strolled along the main streets. Women outnumbered men by about ten to one. The usual reserved demeanor of the British had transformed into joyful singing and dancing. People of all classes and nationalities sang and danced in the streets. The hotels were also extremely lively. People from the provinces arrived by train in an endless stream, and the stations were extremely crowded. The fog gradually thickened at 2:00 AM and was not expected to dissipate until after dawn. Streetcars and subways began running at 4:00 AM, carrying residents to the central district. By 5:30 AM, there were already over 50,000 people on Moore Street. By 7:00 AM, there was no room to stand along the procession route. Lords and Ladies, in carriages or on foot, carried their crowns and headed to Westminster Abbey to await the arrival of the royal family.

### Preparations in the Palace

At that time, the meteorological station issued a report stating that the morning would be mostly sunny, although there might be occasional showers limited to certain areas. The staff at Buckingham Palace were ready from dawn. The horses in the Royal Mews were also saddled and inspected by the Duke of Beaufort, the Master of the Horse. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth had finished their breakfast in the palace. However, as the singing in front of the palace had continued all night, they seemed unable to sleep well. After breakfast, they changed into their coronation robes. At that time, people of all kinds participating in the parade arrived at the palace grounds in an endless stream of carriages. The crowds cheered them frequently. They included the Indian Lancers, the London Mounted Police, the red-uniformed and burly Royal Guards, the brightly armored cavalry, the Royal Bodyguard, the Australian Commonwealth and New Zealand contingents, the Canadian Mounted Police, and the Boy Scouts. The Lord Mayor of London, Sir Harry Twyford, had already departed for Westminster Abbey in the city's traditional carriage.

### The Procession

At 8:30 AM, the first batch of seventy carriages, carrying distant members of the royal family and foreign special envoys and ambassadors, departed from Buckingham Palace and arrived at the Abbey at 9:00 AM. At 9:15 AM, the prime ministers of the various self-governing dominions of the Empire departed from the palace for the Abbey in carriages. Prime Minister Baldwin's carriage led the way, followed by Canadian Prime Minister King and Australian Commonwealth Prime Minister Lyons. At that time, the King and Queen had already changed their coronation robes, and the orchestra played Scottish music in the palace corridors. At 10:00 AM, although the weather was still cloudy, there was a tendency to clear up. By 10:30 AM, a red sun finally broke through the clouds. The King and Queen then departed for Westminster Abbey to perform the ceremony. (Central News Agency, 12th, Havas dispatch)

### Coronation Details

[London] Today, the stained glass windows of Westminster Abbey glittered, the candelabras were lit high, the silver light shone, and the gold and purple light reflected each other, creating a spectacular scene. The central altar was made of pure gold, with several famous objects such as golden plates and ewers next to it. In front of the altar was a golden carpet edged with purple, which was the venue for the coronation. Further ahead was a five-tiered small platform on which the English throne was placed, with the Queen's seat to its left, two tiers lower. In front of the throne was the Edward the Confessor's chair, on which successive English monarchs since Edward have sat to be anointed and crowned. Among the nobles in fragrant clothes and elaborate hairstyles today were sixteen elderly women with white hair, representing the mothers of the English heroes who died for the King in the European War, all wearing their sons' medals on their chests.

Guests Seated

The first members of the royal family to arrive at Westminster Abbey today were the Queen's parents, the Earl and Countess of Strathmore. By 8:45 AM, all eight thousand guests had entered the Abbey. Fifteen minutes later, the first procession slowly arrived in the center of the Abbey, consisting of royal dignitaries from various countries and representatives of various countries.

The Royal Family Takes Their Seats

At 10:00 AM, bishops and clergymen took the royal treasures from the altar and walked slowly through the center to a side room, placing the St. Edward's Crown, the scepter, the sword, and the orb on a table, to await the dignitaries to carry them and join the royal procession. At this time, the choir was led in by the clergy, singing hymns, responding to each other, solemnly and movingly. At 10:15 AM, the royal family entered slowly, and the congregation all stood up to greet them. Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret Rose were led in by their aunt. The two little princesses, wearing long gold and purple robes, walked in front of the eldest princess, their steps neatly aligned, but Rose was young and seemed to have more difficulty keeping up. Next, the Duchess of Gloucester and the Duchess of Kent, wearing long robes, entered and took their seats in the royal family section to the right of the altar. At 10:35 AM, the Queen of Norway arrived, escorted by guards. Next, the Queen Mother entered, wearing the Riband and dazzling diamonds, her long robe carried by four red-clad pages. The Queen of Norway and the Queen Mother slowly entered the royal family section, greeted by the Duchess of Gloucester and escorted to their seats. After the Queen Mother took her seat, the front row of the royal family section was complete, with the Earl of Strathmore closest to the altar, followed by the Countess, the Duchess of Kent, the Duchess of Gloucester, the Queen of Norway, the Queen Mother Mary, and the two little princesses.

The Main Characters Arrive

Then the trumpets sounded together, and the choir sang the hymn "I Was Glad." Everyone knew that the English King and Queen had arrived and were changing clothes in the side room. At this time, the Abbey was filled with golden light, and the guests in the Abbey craned their necks to look. Dignitaries wearing medals and carrying the emblems of various parts of the Empire walked in slowly. Next, four warriors led the way, followed by Prime Minister Baldwin and the prime ministers of the various self-governing dominions.

When the English King and Queen entered the Abbey, several people carried the royal items in front, the Queen followed behind, and the King followed behind the Queen. When the Queen entered, her face was pale and solemn. She walked slowly towards the choir stalls. When the King entered, he wore the royal crown on his head and looked straight ahead. The spectators on both sides bowed in respect.

The Recognition Ceremony

After the King and Queen knelt and prayed privately, they sat on the "Coronation Chair" to perform the recognition ceremony. Then the Archbishop of Canterbury, accompanied by the Lord High Chancellor and the Chief Commissioner of Police, Earl of Cromer, went to the east, south, west, and north platforms. At each side, the Archbishop announced in a loud voice to the congregation, "Gentlemen, I here present unto you King George, your undoubted King: Wherefore all you who are come this day to do your homage and service, are you willing to do the same?" The congregation shouted "God Save King George." Then the trumpets sounded together. Then the oath was taken. The Archbishop asked the King, "Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the Peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa, of all Your Possessions and other Territories to any of them belonging or pertaining, and the Empire of India, according to their respective laws and customs?" The King replied in a low and clear voice without hesitation, "I solemnly promise so to do." The Archbishop then asked, "Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgements?" The King said "I will." The Archbishop then asked several more questions, and the King answered each one in a low voice. Then he went to the altar.

Swearing and Kissing the Bible

Kneeling before the Crown, placing his right hand on the Bible, he swore, "The things which I have here before promised, I will perform, and keep. So help me God." Then he kissed the Bible and signed his name on the oath. Then the first part of the Holy Communion was performed, and the choir recited the creed. Everyone faced the altar, and the coronation ceremony entered a religious ritual.

The Anointing Ceremony

Soon after, the anointing ceremony was performed. The scene at that time was magnificent. The bishops stood respectfully to the left of the King and Queen, and the senior officials of the various countries stood respectfully to their right, wearing large red and white ermine robes. The Queen's train was very long, alternating between purple and gold, and her bodice was covered with diamonds, dazzlingly. The King took off his crown, revealing his black hair. During the singing of a hymn by the choir, the King was stripped of his red robe by the Grand Chamberlain. The King then walked to the St. Edward's Chair in front of the altar and sat down. Four noble gentlemen held a canopy over the King's head. The Archbishop then anointed the King's hands, head, and chest with holy oil. The King stood bareheaded in a white shirt, white trousers, and white socks, looking like a young man. The hearts of the spectators were all moved. The Queen watched intently from the side as the King performed various ceremonies. After the anointing ceremony was completed, the King put on a gold cloth outer garment, offered spurs and a sword, and then put on the coronation robe, offering the orb and scepter. The scene was unforgettable for those who saw it.

Subjects Pledging Allegiance

At 11:30 AM, the crowd all stood up, and there was a rustling sound in the Abbey. The Bishop of Westminster took the royal crown from the altar and handed it to the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Archbishop then raised it high and placed it on the King's head. The crowd shouted "God Save the King." People outside the Abbey also shouted in response. The time was 12:30 PM. The King's coronation was complete. The rustling sound in the Abbey resumed, as the nobles all placed their crowns on their heads, completing it in an instant. Then the solemn oath of allegiance was performed.

After the blessing was completed, the King ascended the throne, with his guards and officials on the left and right. First, the eldest Archbishop knelt and read the oath of allegiance and kissed the King's left cheek. At that time, the King wore a wide robe, the royal crown, and sat upright on the throne. When the nobles stepped forward to express their allegiance, their crowns were held by pageboys in white clothes and white trousers.

The Queen's Coronation

After the oath of allegiance was completed, the Queen, supported by five people carrying her beautiful train, ascended the altar and bowed before the King as she passed by. Her ceremony was simpler than the King's and took less time. Then the princesses and noble ladies each placed their crowns on their heads. The first to perform this ceremony in the royal box was Princess Elizabeth. It was not easy to place the crown on Princess Rose's head. After the ceremony was completed, the Queen walked to her throne, which was set to the King's left, bowing as she passed before the King.

The Entire Ceremony Completed

Then the coronation ceremony entered the final act, ending with the Holy Communion amidst the loud singing of hymns. Then the King and Queen returned to the west door and left the Abbey amidst the loud playing of the national anthem. The scene at that time was even more magnificent and pleasing to the eye than when they entered the Abbey.

Returning to the Palace by Royal Carriage

At nearly 2:00 PM, the ceremonies inside the Abbey were completed. The troops outside the Abbey had already prepared to return to the palace and began to set off. The first carriage, carrying Prime Minister Baldwin and his wife, did not leave the Abbey until 2:16 PM. The Queen Mother's glass carriage followed closely behind, with the two little princesses and their grandmother riding together. At that time, the bells inside the Abbey rang loudly, and the shouts of the crowds inside and outside the Abbey went straight to the sky. The King and Queen ascended the royal carriage together at 2:40 PM.

The Weather Did Not Cooperate

As soon as the King and Queen left the Abbey, a heavy rain suddenly fell, but the enthusiasm of the people along the way was not diminished. Cheers thundered as the royal carriage passed by. Thirty-seven thousand London schoolchildren had gathered on the banks of the River Thames to watch the spectacle. Along the way, heads were packed together, mostly wearing raincoats, and some threw their hats into the air to express their excitement.

Foreign dignitaries in Buckingham Palace stood in front of the palace windows to watch the King and Queen's return. At 4:04 PM, the royal carriage entered the south gate of the palace in the pouring rain. The accompanying troops marched in the rain, so they were soaked all over, the wetness penetrating to their skin. At that time, the palace guards played the national anthem loudly.

Thanking the People

After the King and Queen arrived at the palace, the crowds outside the palace did not disperse for a long time, singing the national anthem and shouting "We want to see the King." Princess Elizabeth stood briefly at the window. At 4:40 PM, the King and Queen walked to the balcony in front of the palace and bowed to the crowd to express their gratitude. The two little princesses, wearing small golden crowns, followed closely behind. Then the Queen Mother Mary and the Duke of Kent also arrived. The crowds all took off their hats and stood in the heavy rain, singing the national anthem again before dispersing. (Central News Agency, 12th, Reuters dispatch)

### Coronation Attendees All in White Satin Breeches

People's Front Delegates From Various Countries Allowed to Wear Tailcoats

[London] According to court etiquette, for every grand ceremony, those attending to offer congratulations must wear white satin breeches and white stockings. This custom has been followed for hundreds of years. At this coronation of the King, however, because French Foreign Minister Delbos, Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, and Spanish Republican government special envoy Pestiero were all granted special permission to wear ordinary tailcoats, without the need for breeches and stockings, the People's Front countries will also show their difference in clothing. However, American diplomats, who have always advocated the democratization of clothing, will this time follow British court rituals and wear breeches. The Spanish Republican government's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Asgalade, will also wear breeches and white stockings, as this is the custom for ambassadors to the United Kingdom, and he does not wish to change it lightly.

### The Duke of Windsor's Wedding Issue

Stand-off Between the Royal Family and the Government

[London] The Associated Press learned today that a dispute has arisen between the royal family and the government regarding the Duke of Windsor's wedding. Members of the royal family want to participate formally, but the government opposes participation, whether formal or not. It is understood that since Miss Wallis Warfield's (i.e., Mrs. Simpson) divorce decree officially took effect, the royal family has dispatched the Duke and Duchess of Kent to attend the wedding. However, the government strongly disapproves and has also expressed disappointment at the Duke of Windsor's meeting with Mrs. Simpson in Menzingen. The two sides are currently at a standstill. The royal family believes that this is a family matter, while the government believes that this move will damage the people's enthusiasm for supporting the new King and Queen.

### Lively Scenes in London

Streets Crowded With People, Hardly Any Space. Some Even Brought Food and Slept Outdoors to Await the Dawn. The Entire Police Force Mobilized to Maintain Order.

[London] Last night, before it was even dark, crowds had already gathered along the route of the coronation procession, preparing to wait all night in order to get a better viewing position. By midnight, the entire route was filled with four or five rows of people. When thousands of store employees and office workers left their offices in the evening, they saw that the streets were already full, and everyone wanted to choose a place to watch the procession, which stretched about two and a half miles from Westminster Abbey to Buckingham Palace. Many women sat high on the steps of the Piccadilly Circus, thinking that they were in a high position and could see clearly, but the police stopped them, telling them that the military authorities would use this place as a signal station. The women were greatly disappointed and left. It rained heavily all morning yesterday, but it stopped in the evening. The crowds flocked to the West End by train, streetcar, car, and carriage. Most of those who arrived in London earliest came from the provinces. Among them were some who were very old, and others who even brought tents, preparing to sleep in the streets. A young Scout instructor from Czechoslovakia left home on April 4 and walked across Europe to watch the ceremony. Last night, the authorities decided to open Hyde Park all night, and the crowds quickly turned it into a large campsite. More than a thousand people were camped out in Trafalgar Square last night. Most of them wore clothes that were both warm and waterproof. According to a message from the Ministry of Aviation at 9:30 PM last night, the weather was still uncertain, and thunderstorms were expected before noon on the 12th. After that, the climate would be cold and cloudy, with a tendency to continue raining. However, regardless of the weather, the soldiers participating in today's parade would not wear overcoats. The West End's scenery this morning reminded people of the grand celebration of the previous King's 25th anniversary of his accession to the throne. Streetcars traveling back and forth were full of cheering and singing people. At midnight, Piccadilly Circus was extremely crowded. Men and women stood on the upper level of streetcars, waving flags and cheering. There were also people holding concerts on the roadside. The police pushed through the crowd to stop them. At 1:00 AM, the police placed barriers at the foot of Constitution Hill to block traffic directly to the palace. As midnight approached, the fog became thicker, and the streets were shrouded in thick fog. No one knew how many tens of thousands of people were sleeping soundly on the sidewalks of the various streets. The police allowed the crowds to lie down on the stands, but they had to leave by 4:00 AM this morning. (Central News Agency, 11th, Reuters dispatch)

Today, more than 200,000 people from the provinces came to the capital to watch the ceremony. The railroads will run fifty special trains. The consumption of food is expected to be enormous. Along the parade route, stalls have been temporarily set up along the streets and in the parks to sell food to satisfy the spectators' hunger. The government has temporarily set up stages in Hyde Park and Green Park, with food and beverage outlets selling drinks, milk, and various fruit juices. It is estimated that the drinks and food stored include 12,500 kilograms of tea, 6 tons of sugar, 75,000 liters of milk, 100,000 ham sandwiches, 100,000 cakes, and 5,000 boxes of fried sweet potatoes. (Central News Agency, 11th, Reuters dispatch)

[London] When the coronation ceremony is held tomorrow, the parade will pass through the streets, and the spectators will number in the millions. From midnight today, spectators have been standing on the sidewalks along the road, packed together, making vehicular traffic extremely difficult. Therefore, it is not easy for the police to maintain order. Fortunately, the police authorities have made various preparations in advance to prevent accidents. The entire police force of London, 25,000 officers, will change into newly made uniforms tomorrow morning and be transferred to the streets through which the parade passes to maintain order. The original police posts in various places will be temporarily guarded by 8,000 supplementary police. All police officers have been dispatched from midnight today. Wooden and iron barriers have been stored everywhere on the streets to temporarily block the crowds and prevent incidents from happening. Temporary first-aid stations have been set up in Scotland Yard, where the national criminal investigation department is located, and in various parks, with several ambulances parked there. They can rush to the rescue as soon as a warning is received. A special police force has been set up near Westminster Abbey to protect it. Tomorrow, all police officers will be on duty in the Scotland Yard intelligence room, and the details of the parade will be reported to all senior officers at any time by telephone and loudspeaker. Specialists will be hired at key locations to use loudspeakers to advise the crowds to maintain order. In addition, the political police have also made preparations in secret to protect the important domestic and foreign figures attending the coronation ceremony. For several weeks, political police officers have secretly investigated the names of residents of houses along the streets through which the parade passes, and those watching on balconies. Not only that, the British ports have also been carefully interrogating incoming passengers to prevent troublemakers from mixing in. Regarding this, the London political police have been in contact with provincial and foreign police authorities for several months to prevent incidents in advance.

### Southern Irish Republicans Oppose Enthroning the English King

Parades and Demonstrations Clash with Police; Parliament Discusses New Draft Constitution

Dublin, last night: Republican processions and demonstrations against the coronation of the English king as King of Ireland, and demanding the immediate restoration of the Irish Republic, led to clashes here. Police fired shots over the heads of the crowds to intimidate them. The parade originally intended to hold a mass rally at Grangegorman Mental Hospital at its end, but the Minister of Justice prohibited the demonstration and deployed a large number of police to the city center to be on guard. At the time, Parliament was discussing the second reading of the Constitution Bill, so additional guards were placed near the parliament building. Subsequently, clashes occurred between the police and the masses on O'Connell Street and Beresford Street, the location of Liberty Hall where the headquarters of the volunteer army was established during the 1916 uprising, injuring several people. Before the police dispersed the crowd, demonstrators listened to their leaders read telegrams of sympathy sent from the All-India Congress and the American Irish Republican organizations.

During the parliamentary discussion of the second reading of the Constitution Bill, Executive Council President Éamon de Valera declared that abolishing the laws requiring oaths of allegiance to the English king and the office of Governor-General was the first step in implementing the new constitution, with the new constitution being the third step. The plan is now to restore Ireland's ancient name, Eire, which is respected in the hearts of all Irish people worldwide. The President of Eire will defend all the rights of the people, but there is absolutely no question of a dictatorship system. The President will be elected by the people, and the parliament will define his powers. Yesterday, when the Parliament convened, its flagpoles did not display the tricolor flag as usual, which the residents of Dublin found strange. According to authorities, this was because the flag rope was broken and there was no other rope available to replace it for the time being. (Central News Agency, 12th, Reuters)

### Odds and Ends

News Reporters Overwhelmed

[London] There are currently 6,000 journalists and typists, 5,000 news vendors, and 200 delivery vehicles here. They will work together tonight and all day tomorrow to distribute news about the coronation ceremony across the country and to countries around the world on both the European and American continents. Dedicated telephone lines have been designated to transmit the news. When the coronation ceremony is held at Westminster Abbey tomorrow, reporters from various newspapers will be allowed inside to watch, but the reporters' seats are in a remote corner, making it difficult to see the various programs of the ceremony. As for the film photographers, only six will be allowed inside, all in small rooms with only the lens of the camera exposed. After the film is shot, the footage will be inspected and edited before it can be released to the public.

### London Transport Workers' Strike Unlikely to Spread

[London] The possibility of the London bus strike spreading to trams and streetcars has now greatly decreased, as the Transport and General Workers' Union decided last night that it was not appropriate to escalate the dispute at this stage. According to the executive committee of the union, they have carefully studied the report of the court of inquiry regarding the strikers' demands. They are currently writing to the striking bus workers to discuss the matter. This means that the union will ask the Central Busmen's Committee to reconsider everything. The union will also make strong representations to the committee, urging it to accept the court's report and the final proposal of the London Passenger Transport Board. It is expected that the 25,000 strikers will meet this month or tomorrow to consider this recommendation. The Transport Board has proposed that, in addition to the seven-and-a-half-hour workday, it is willing to consider all the issues raised by the workers, such as speeding up driving, frequent changes in schedules, and the lack of fixed meal times.

### Ten Major Powers Enjoyed by the English King

But Will Never Actually Be Exercised

The new King George VI has been crowned. Many people want to ask, do the powers enjoyed by the new king compare to those of any monarch in British history? Some people say without hesitation that the cabinet—not the House of Commons—now holds the highest power in Britain. However, these people forget that the king still wields great power, should he choose to exercise it.

The English King can implement the following ten things without consulting Parliament:

㊀ He has the power to disband the army; ㊁ He can dismiss all officers, from the commander-in-chief downwards; ㊂ He can dismiss the officers and soldiers of the navy; ㊃ He can sell all warships and naval supplies; ㊄ In the event of a British military defeat, he can sacrifice all his Duchy of Cornwall and negotiate peace with the enemy; ㊅ He can wage war to conquer other countries for Britain; ㊆ He can ennoble any male or female citizen of Great Britain; ㊇ He can make any parish in Great Britain a university; ㊈ He can dismiss most civil servants; ㊉ He can pardon all criminals.

These powers are quite extensive. If Britain engages in war, these powers could undo all the efforts of the nation. Although no one has ever thought that King George would exercise these powers, he does indeed enjoy them according to the constitution.

The English King will approve any document presented by the responsible minister. This is, of course, well known. Some even say that if both houses agreed to send him his own death warrant, he would still have to sign it.

Queen Victoria signed many documents in the past, but she often protested. Sir Sidney Lee said, "She often wrote to a cabinet member saying that although she never agreed with this or that suggestion, she still often listened to him when needed, and formally signed her approval.

King George VI still has the power to refuse to assent to bills passed by Parliament, but the king has not exercised this power since Queen Anne ascended the throne.

Some people believe that the King cannot leave Britain while in office without the consent of Parliament. However, in the early years of George I, this clause in the law was repealed to allow him to travel to Hanover. Edward VII exercised his right to travel abroad on several occasions. George V set a new precedent by going to India to be crowned Emperor.

King George VI, if he wishes, can commute or reduce the sentences of criminals. The custom of submitting lists of death sentences to the king was abolished when the young Queen Victoria ascended the throne. Parliament passed a law giving the Home Secretary the prerogative of remission and commutation of sentences. Although the Home Secretary is still responsible for this, he does so in the name of the King. There is an old saying, "The King can do no wrong." This has become actual law. For example, if the English King forges a check, he cannot be summoned to court for questioning. If he damages the reputation of any person, he cannot be accused of defamation. Professor Dicey's book "The Law of the Constitution" states that if the English King personally shoots his Prime Minister, no court can prosecute him. Although the English King cannot be sued in his own court, he can sue others for their offenses.

The English King's car does not have license plates, and the speed of travel is not restricted. The English King's telegrams must be sent first and free of charge. His letters do not need postage stamps and must be delivered free of charge.

King George, if he wishes, can ride in a carriage all the way to Rotten Row in Hyde Park. The English King can purchase houses or land, but according to the law, he cannot rent, because the King cannot be someone's tenant or be bound by the people.

The English King does not pay income tax. All his property comes from the rights of the monarch. Queen Victoria and King Edward VII both paid income tax. Queen Victoria first paid because the people at that time regarded income tax as a heavy tax, so she first paid as an example for the people. King only became exempt from this tax when George V ascended the throne.

The English King's palaces do not pay municipal rates, nor does he pay death taxes. However, his private property must be taxed in the same way as the people.

The officers and servants who serve King George in the royal court cannot be arrested by the police. They also have no obligation to serve as jurors.

The English King has a right that he will never enjoy, which is the right to vote. Even the lowest laborer on the King's estate in Sandringham has the right to vote, but the King's name cannot be found on the voter registration list for the Sandringham parish. People hope that the English King will maintain strict neutrality in politics.

When King George goes to the theater, even if he is sitting in the royal box, he must pay for his ticket. He attends the theater in a private capacity. Except for performances or charity exhibitions on holidays, newspapers cannot announce his scheduled outings. Furthermore, when he attends the theater in a private capacity, national music should not be played loudly when entering the theater to attract people's attention.

All of the above are the powers enjoyed by the new King George VI after ascending the throne. There are many kinds and they are great, so many people may be surprised to see them, and even the King himself may be surprised. The various powers enjoyed by the English King listed in the first part of this article were drafted by Mr. Bagehot, a shrewd thinker, banker, and writer, during the reign of Queen Victoria. Someone sent his article to the Queen to read, and the Queen exclaimed, "Why, the wicked man has written such a thing! My people will not believe it!" Although she was doubtful, the great legal scholars of England had to admit that the King enjoyed these powers. Today, when King George is on the throne, it is still indisputable. However, it is a certainty that the new King will not exercise these powers.

### Yu Xuezhong to Assume New Post in Northern Jiangsu

Former Northeastern Army to Comply with Orders for Reorganization; Yu's Troops Prepare to Enter and Station in Jiangsu

Bengbu Correspondent: After Yu Xuezhong was appointed as the Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner, he went to Nanjing via Shanghai and Jinan to consult with Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin and Liu Zhi, Chairman of the Military Reorganization Committee of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, regarding the implementation of the reorganization of the former Northeastern Army. It is reported that the divisions of the former Northeastern Army will comply with the central government's reorganization measures and be reorganized, changing from the original two-regiment system per division to a two-brigade system per division, with two regiments per brigade, totaling four regiments per division. The directly subordinate units will also be reorganized, completely reorganized into national defense forces. During the reorganization period, each unit will still receive disaster relief pay. Once the reorganization is completed, all pay will be directly issued by the Ministry of Military Affairs. From then on, the term "Northeastern Army" will become a historical term. Yu may inspect his troops in Bengbu in the near future, and then proceed to Huaiyin to assume his new post. In addition to the 51st Army's Li Mouzhou's 3rd Division and directly subordinate units, the 110th Division of Zhang Zhengfang stationed in Mengcheng will also move there. Yu's troops will be stationed in the five counties of Northern Jiangsu: Huaiyin, Siyang, Shuyang, Suqian, and Suining. The deployment is roughly in place. The 26th Route Army of Sun Lianzhong has already ceded its defense area, and its 30th Division has temporarily moved to Huaian, while its 27th Division, 31st Division, and Independent 44th Brigade have been completely transferred to Henan and have already departed separately. Yu's troops are preparing to depart to take over the defense, which will take about a month to complete. As for the routes into Jiangsu, there are a total of three routes, both water and land. The baggage and equipment will be transported east by boat along the Huai River, through Hongze Lake, transferred to the Qing River, across the Tianfei Dam, and directly to the north gate of Huaiyin City. The troops will depart on foot, advancing on two land routes. The southern route goes from Bengbu through Fengyang, Mingguang, Jiangba, and Gaoliangjian to Huaiyin. The northern route goes from Bengbu through Wuhe and Sixian to the Qiaosusu area. The Pacification Commissioner's Office here, as its troops are about to depart, has specially appointed Chief Liu Zhenhe of the Adjutant Office as the camp commander to inspect the barracks. Liu Zhun set off from Bengbu at 8:00 a.m. on the 11th, accompanied by more than ten people, including Adjutant Feng Mengrui of the 51st Army Headquarters, on a specially hired small steamer, and sailed along the Huai River to Huaiyin to arrange everything.

### The Story of the Reduced Collection of Land Value Tax in Beijing

After Thorough Consideration According to Laws and Regulations; Lowest Tax Rate to Alleviate People's Hardships

Nanjing Correspondent: The municipal government held a Premier Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week ceremony for all staff at 8:00 a.m. yesterday, presided over by Secretary-General Wang Shufang. After leading the ceremony, he reported on the reduced collection of land value tax, saying that the tax rate was initially drafted by the municipal government in accordance with the provisions of the Land Law and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and amendment by the Ministry of Interior, and then sent by the Executive Yuan to the Central Political Committee for detailed study by the Land Special Committee before a decision was made. Therefore, the land value tax rate in this city can be said to be the most legal and fair tax rate. As for the assessment of land prices, it was also based on the registered prices, reported prices, and various provisions of the Land Law by the Land Administration Bureau and the Land Valuation Committee, taking meticulous consideration to obtain an average price. The procedure was legal, and the valuation was fair. The reason why the municipal government is reducing the collection is not because the tax rate set in the past or the estimated land price may have flaws. It is due to the fact that the general public often takes a wait-and-see attitude towards new government taxes, regardless of whether they are reasonable or not. In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the new tax and encourage people to pay actively, we decided to give a 10% discount for the first three years of the initial collection of land value tax, referring to the financial practice of giving preferential treatment to those who pay taxes on time. Secondly, since Nanjing became the capital, land prices have soared due to political reforms and the development of public utilities. However, since the outbreak of the national crisis, and influenced by the global economic downturn, the market has not been very prosperous. For example, Taiping Road is the most prosperous street in the city, but store closures are frequently heard. At the same time, it is not easy for landowners to rent out buildings after they have been built, or they have land but no funds to build. Therefore, in order to reduce the actual difficulties of the people, it was decided to temporarily collect land value tax at a 10% discount. As for why we decided to reduce it to 90%, and not 80% or 85%, it is because we still intend to comply with central government laws and regulations while considering the people's hardships. The Land Law stipulates that the minimum tax rate for construction land should be 10 per thousand of the land price. The original tax rate for construction land in this city was set at 14 per thousand. If collected at 90%, it would only be slightly above 12 per thousand. The right to give an 80% discount to owner-occupied land according to law would result in an actual collection of only slightly above 10 per thousand, with the tax rate only reaching 72% of the tax amount, which is only slightly above 10 per thousand. If reduced to 80% or 85%, it would be lower than the limit stipulated by the Land Law, which is illegal. The calculation of the various land taxes in this city after being collected at 90% is as follows:

㊀ Construction land, collected at 14 per thousand of the land price of 1,000 yuan, and paid at a 90% discount, should pay a land value tax of 12 yuan and 60 cents. For the owner-occupied part, collected at 80% again, 1 yuan and 8 cents should be paid, actually only collecting at 72% of the tax amount, with the tax rate only slightly above 10 per thousand. ㊁ Agricultural land, collected at 10 per thousand of the land price of 1,000 yuan, and paid at a 90% discount, should pay a land value tax of 9 yuan. For the self-cultivated part, collected at 80% again, 7 yuan and 20 cents should be paid, with this tax rate only slightly above 7 per thousand. ㊂ Unimproved land, collected at 1.5 per thousand of the land price of 1,000 yuan, and paid at a 90% discount, should pay a land value tax of 22 yuan and 50 cents, with this tax rate only slightly above 22 per thousand. ㊃ Wasteland, collected at 40 per thousand of the land price of 1,000 yuan, and paid at a 90% discount, should pay a land value tax of 36 yuan, with the tax rate being 36 per thousand.

In addition, this city has a special situation, namely, restricted-use land and land through which roads pass, which cannot be taxed as ordinary land in order to be fair. Therefore, the previous municipal meeting specially proposed a discussion and decided on the following reduction and exemption measures: ㊀ Restricted-use land: if there are buildings that are still used as before, the agricultural land tax rate will be used to collect 10 per thousand of the land price of 1,000 yuan, and the land value tax of 9 yuan will be paid at a 90% discount, with the tax rate only being 9 per thousand. If it is temporarily used as agricultural land because it cannot be built due to restrictions, it will be collected at half the rate before the restriction is lifted, that is, each 1,000 yuan will pay 5 yuan, and a 90% discount will be given, with only 4 yuan and 50 cents being collected, and the tax rate only being 4.5 per thousand. If it cannot be used at all, the land value tax will be exempted before the original state is restored. ㊁ Land through which roads pass: (A) The part through which the road passes will be exempted if the people have already reduced the land for road use. (B) If there is a road passing through vacant land, the land that is not allowed to be built according to regulations, and is in the form of ruins because it cannot be used, will be exempted. (C) If there are already buildings on the land through which the road passes, it is considered to have been used to its full potential before being acquired. Even if it will be acquired in the future, there will be compensation for the land price and demolition costs, so there will be no loss. The land value tax will still be collected as usual.

In summary, the municipal government's reduction of the land value tax this time is reasonable and fair in every way. However, a small number of people are still getting an inch and wanting a mile, hoping to reduce it further. A few days ago, the mayor convened a tea party for local gentry to explain the reduced collection of land value tax this time. Some people even requested a further reduction and extended the reduced collection method to five years. In order not to violate laws and regulations, it is difficult to comply with this request. This city is the capital, and construction is heavy. If the people are too demanding in reducing the taxes they should pay, it will inevitably affect the progress of the capital's construction. The amount of reduction made by the municipal government this time has reached the point where it cannot be reduced any further. It is hoped that the citizens will deeply understand this purpose and actively pay, so as not to increase the government's difficulties in handling affairs. Moreover, the Central Political Committee has revised the penalty clauses for late payment of land value tax in the Land Law. According to the original penalty clauses of the Land Law, the penalties were too light. Although the government can auction the people's property if they fail to pay their taxes by the statutory deadline, it only levies a penalty of 5% annual interest in addition to deducting the taxes they should pay. In this way, cunning people can owe taxes for up to four years, deposit the taxes they should pay in the bank, and enjoy an annual interest of 8% to 10%, which will be used to offset the taxes they should pay in the future, and there will still be a surplus of 3% to 5% annual interest. Or, due to a lack of cash, borrowing from the bank requires bearing an interest rate of more than 10% per year. If the taxes they should pay are not paid and kept for their own use, it is equivalent to borrowing money from the government, bearing only a 5% annual interest rate. In view of this drawback, the Central Political Committee has specially changed the interest on arrears of taxes to 10% per year. In this way, cunning business owners will have nothing to gain. Therefore, it is hoped that all citizens will truly recognize that the municipal government's reduction of land value tax is purely to alleviate the people's hardships, and it is hoped that the colleagues of the municipal government will explain to the citizens at any time and place and persuade the people to pay actively, so as not to affect the progress of the capital's construction and give the people of the whole country a bad impression.

Severe Plague Outbreak in Xiatangji Town

Xiatangji Town, located seventy li north of Hefei, is a wheat market in central Anhui. Every year, hundreds of thousands of people from various places go to the market to trade wheat. However, just as the wheat market season was approaching this year, a plague suddenly broke out in the town. In just a few days, over a hundred people have died, mostly children. Those infected die within six hours at most, their bodies turning black as if poisoned. Currently, the afflicted are flocking to the city and seeking treatment at the Christian Hospital. After treating them, the hospital does not allow them to be hospitalized to prevent infection.

### Haizhou

Salt Production in Dayishan Salt River

In Guanyun County, the Dayishan Salt River has been abandoned since the Six Dams were abandoned. The amount of water in the Salt River rises and falls with the tide, and navigation also shifts with the tide, resulting in long-term siltation. The riverbed is more than two feet higher than the center of the river. Farmers along the tributaries in the western countryside collect river soil to make salt for consumption. In recent years, the water in the Salt River has been saltier than seawater. The soil is saturated with saltwater. The salt in the riverbed is evaporated by the sun, resulting in a lot of small salt appearing, making a white expanse along the banks. At night, the salt in the riverbed glows with golden light, which is quite a sight to see.

### Cotton Industry Trading Company Increases Capital

Shareholders' Meeting Resolved Yesterday to Increase Capital from 2 Million to 10 Million

China Cotton Industry Trading Company engages in the business of raw cotton and yarn, etc., and has ginneries, etc., in the main locations of cotton-producing provinces across the country, purchasing large quantities of cotton and selling yarn, etc., on behalf of customers. Its business is exceptionally developed. Last year, with a bumper cotton harvest, the total amount of cotton sold reached over 13 million yuan, the yarn sold was about 5 million yuan, and other entrusted businesses amounted to about 3 million yuan, totaling over 20 million yuan. The original capital of 2 million yuan was insufficient, so it was decided to expand. A shareholders' meeting was held at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon at the company's office at No. 8 Gongguan Road to discuss the matter. Over forty shareholders attended, including Zhu Hanzhang, Bei Songsun, Hu Yun'an, Rong Zongjiao, Wang Lengbo, Yan Yutang, Zhang Yunchun, etc., representing four-fifths of the shares.

### The Economic Situation at Home and Abroad in the 25th Year

Memorandum from the International Trade Bureau to the Ministry of Industry

The International Trade Bureau, in its report on the domestic and international economic and trade situation for the entire year of last year, stated: "Respectfully submitted, this year marks the first year after the implementation of the new currency system in our country's foreign trade. Whether in terms of trade value or trade balance, there has been substantial progress. Calculated in national currency, exports have increased by 22% compared to the previous year, and imports have increased by 2% compared to the previous year. Due to the larger increase in export trade, the trade deficit has been sharply reduced by more than 10.07 million yuan compared to the previous year. The trade trend is gradually improving. In terms of commodities, the main exports of domestic products are tung oil, silk, egg products, metals, and raw and processed leather goods. Moreover, to meet overseas demand, the export volume this year has increased significantly compared to previous years. The main imports of foreign goods are hardware, machinery, chemical products, wheels, and various metal products. Among them, materials necessary for construction, such as hardware and wheels, have seen a significant increase in imports this year, which seems to be a sign of active economic construction in the country in recent years. In the future, as the situation of domestic unity becomes more consolidated, and the central authority is further expanded, there will be even more significant progress in finance. It is expected that the improvement of international trade will not be difficult. At the end of the year, we hereby submit a report on the trade situation for the entire year for your review. Respectfully submitted to Wu, Minister of Industry, by Guo Bingwen, Director of the International Trade Bureau."

Overview of the International Economy

The international economy in 1936 had entered a state of recovery. Since 1933, major trading countries had already made some economic progress. However, it was generally believed that this was a fragmented recovery from a long-term decline, rather than the overall prosperity of the entire world. However, 1936 can no longer be viewed in this way because the entire world has emerged from the depths of panic and entered a stage of rapid economic development. The United Kingdom, the British Commonwealth, the Scandinavian countries, and other countries with links to the gold pound had already embarked on the road to recovery after devaluing their currencies. Japan, the United States, and some raw material producing countries had also achieved economic recovery in 1933. During the period from 1934 to 1935, inventories in various countries gradually decreased, production was limited, and the weather cleared up without rain. Therefore, in 1936, world commodity prices generally and rapidly increased, and even raw material producing countries were able to restore their purchasing power. Moreover, the stability of exchange rates, the ease of finance, the increase in production, the reduction in unemployment, the rise in freight rates, and the recovery of shipping are even more evident. As for the devaluation of the French franc in September and the establishment of the tripartite monetary agreement between Britain, the United States, and France, they are even more helpful to the world's recovery. However, although the international economy this year can be viewed optimistically, the current structure of recovery is indeed due to the improvement and prosperity of various countries themselves. The volume of world trade is still 20% short of that in 1929, and the fiscal budgets of various countries are mostly unable to balance, and a large part of the national income must be used for non-productive military construction. This situation will easily lead to the recurrence of unbalanced economic conditions. Therefore, the important work of various countries in 1937 should be to expand the foundation of their own recovery, so that world trade can develop freely. And the prerequisite for this kind of work is the abandonment of economic nationalism and the elimination of political fears.

Overview of the Domestic Economy

This year, the domestic economy has gradually become prosperous. Although foreign aggression is frequent and the national crisis is pressing, the stability of the domestic political situation and the unification of government orders are the biggest factors in promoting economic improvement. This is because this year, there have been bumper harvests of agricultural products in various places, and the yields of various grains have shown a consistent upward trend. The purchasing power of rural areas has also increased, which is of great benefit to the activities of the national economy. The implementation of the new currency system policy before the year has stabilized finance, and industry and commerce are not as depressed as in the past. Therefore, the export of products has become active. Moreover, all parties in the government and the public are making every effort to promote economic construction. This year, the central government and local governments have focused on economic construction as the core of their governance. Therefore, the entire economy has a thriving appearance.

Optimism from Trade

Looking at this year's foreign trade, it is obviously more progressive than in previous years. Calculated in national currency, exports increased by 3%, and imports increased by 2%. Because the increase in export trade was larger, the trade deficit was sharply reduced by more than 10.07 million yuan. The trade trend is gradually improving, which is very gratifying. The reason for this is that export goods are easily promoted with the help of foreign exchange, and some commodities, such as tung oil, leather goods, and ore, are well suited to overseas demand. The imports of goods are due to the active domestic economic construction, and the demand for materials necessary for construction, such as vehicles and steel, is very high. Generally speaking, since the implementation of the new currency policy in November last year, the domestic economic situation has improved greatly. Therefore, the promotion of international trade is expected. In the future, the situation of domestic unity will become more consolidated, the central authority will be further expanded, and there will be even more significant progress in finance. Economic construction and the development of transportation are continuing and are in full swing. We hope that various countries will supply the materials necessary for construction. On the other hand, we hope that various countries will eliminate the shackles of international trade, improve preferential tariffs, import quotas, and exchange restrictions, so that our country's export trade will be unimpeded. Then, the international trade in the coming year will be even more prosperous.

### Spring Cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are on the Market, and Silk Cocoon Merchants Begin to Purchase

The United Committee of the Two Provinces Has Issued a Notice for Cocoon Collection Registration; Silk Factories in Various Places are Organizing Machines to Prepare for Work

After the National Economic Committee's Silk Improvement Committee stipulated the standard price for spring cocoons in the 26th year, the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang announced the handling of cocoon collection registration. Silk cocoon merchants have borrowed money from various banks and businesses to organize institutions to set out to purchase. The silk factories will start work after the new cocoons are on the market. The details are as follows:

The Two Provinces Announce Cocoon Collection Registration

The Zhejiang Provincial Silk Control Committee issued a notice to solicit merchants to purchase spring cocoons within the province: "In accordance with the 'Provisional Measures for Managing Cocoon Collection during the Spring Season of the 16th Year' promulgated and implemented by the provincial government, all silk cocoon merchants from within and outside the province who wish to operate in various cocoon-producing areas within the province to collect improved cocoons and local cocoons must apply for registration with the Committee from today until 5:00 pm on May 18th. When registering, they must pay a guarantee deposit according to law (100 yuan per double stove for improved varieties, and 60 yuan per double stove for local varieties). This is hereby announced." The Jiangsu Provincial Silk Management Committee has also handled the management of silk cocoon merchants' cocoon collection.

Spring Cocoons Begin to Be on the Market This Year

This year's spring cocoons in Shaoxing, Yuyao, and other places in Zhejiang Province have already begun to be on the market. Haining, Jiaxing, Pinghu, and other places will also be on the market one after another. This year's spring cocoons in Wuxi, Liyang, and other places in Jiangsu Province are scheduled to be on the market around the 25th. Silk manufacturers and cocoon merchants from Shanghai, Wuxi, Zhejiang, and other places have borrowed money from various banks and money shops to organize cocoon collection agencies and begin to set out to purchase. As for the output of spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang this year, it is more than last year because the overseas silk market rose sharply last year, and farmers who raised silkworms were able to make a profit. Now, due to the large-scale hatching this year,

Silk Factories in Various Places Organize for Work

Silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces were forced to stop work one after another due to the depletion of raw materials. Taking Shanghai as an example, there are more than 50 in total. As of now, less than one-tenth have started work. Now, because the spring cocoons have begun to be on the market, they have all organized machines and are preparing to start work. As for workers' wages, starting this spring, it is planned to try out a production system, which will be implemented after achieving results. In addition, all silk reeling machines are old and no longer keep up with the new trend. Therefore, there are plans to transform them into new styles, namely the American-style vertical reeling machine. Several companies have already implemented the transformation.

### Participation in the Paris Exposition

The Delegation Telegraphed Again, Requesting Central Government Support

Regarding the matter of our country's participation in the Paris Exposition, Ambassador Gu has now replied by telegram, stating that he has formally consulted with the French authorities and received special treatment. Therefore, the exhibitors hope that the delegation can depart on the French post office ship Aramis on the 29th of this month and arrive in Marseille, France on June 29th. The next morning, they will arrive in Paris and negotiate with the conference authorities. The Chinese delegation therefore telegraphed the central authorities again yesterday, requesting support. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "Chairman Wang of the Nanjing Central Political Committee, Acting President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education, Vice Ministers Xu and Zou of the Ministry of Finance, Acting Secretary-General Wei, and Director He of the Political Affairs Office, please note: The case of participating in the Paris Exposition has been specifically approved by Chairman Chiang and approved by Vice President Kong. The Political Council has approved it and the government will provide subsidies. The committee originally intended to stop participating because of time constraints and the fear that the competition products could not be delivered before the deadline. After telegraphing Ambassador Gu, we received a reply stating that the matter had been formally discussed with the French authorities, and the association had been given special treatment, with two exhibition rooms allocated and construction and decoration underway. It is difficult to report that we are not participating. The competition products can be shipped to France at the end of June, etc. At the same time, all exhibitors have insisted that they still hope to participate immediately. I believe that this matter is of great importance, concerning international credibility. Now that it is difficult to stop, we can only proceed as before. The competition products emphasize quality rather than quantity, and are strictly selected. At the same time, we will take this opportunity to publicize the progress of our country's construction in recent years. We will work together to strive for international honor. We should ask your excellencies to check the previous case and continue to support it. We will immediately allocate funds to facilitate the process. We are extremely grateful. Li Shizeng, Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Pan Gongzhan, and Chu Minyi respectfully."

### The Chamber of Commerce Notifies Various Industries

Send Personnel to Attend Lectures on Income Tax; Lectures are Held Simultaneously in the North and South Cities

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in order to meet the needs of the business community, continued to run income tax study classes simultaneously in the North and South Cities. Yesterday, it notified various industry associations: "To Whom It May Concern, the 'Instructions on the Collection of the First, Second, and Third Types of Income Tax' have now been revised and promulgated by the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance. In order to suit the needs of various industries, this association is still running income tax and improved Chinese bookkeeping training classes at the Commercial Vocational School on Xiaonandou Zhonghua Road in the South City and at this association at the Tianhougong Bridge in the North City. Mr. Xu Yongzuo of the Certified Public Accountant Firm will be the lecturer, with a teaching period of nine weeks.

### Chamber of Commerce Instructions on Doubts about Sticking Stamps on Outgoing Goods Notification Slips

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce replied to Tongji Miscellaneous Grain Store yesterday: "In response to your letter dated the 11th of this month, with a paper attached for outgoing goods notification slip, asking whether it should be affixed with stamps, etc., the reply is as follows: ㊀ The association's reply regarding the outgoing goods slips used by the transportation company that should be affixed with stamps is based on the instructions of the Ministry of Finance's Taxation Office No. 7528 to this association on October 19, 24th year of the Republic. The bill of lading is used by the consignor or the consignor's trading partner to extract goods from the transportation company, while the transportation company's outgoing goods slip is used to collect the consigned goods from the consignor. Its effect is exactly opposite to the bill of lading. Therefore, it should be affixed with stamps according to the goods extraction slip in item 5. ㊁ The sample slip attached to your letter indicates that 'Please ask your friend to quickly bring the bill of lading to the warehouse to jointly weigh with a certain number. Do not delay. If there is a delay, the customer number will weigh by itself, which has nothing to do with our company.' Interpreting the meaning of the entire article, it is only urging them to jointly weigh within a certain period. There is no statement that goods can be extracted from the warehouse with this notification slip. If this statement cannot be considered a document for extracting goods, it is naturally not necessary to affix stamps according to law."

Currently, in addition to the 400 yuan advanced for the Jianyan Society, 1,600 yuan should be deposited in the Postal Savings Bureau first. As for the association's expenses thereafter, the remaining cash will be used to maintain it for two and a half months first. All the insufficient amounts should be raised by the standing committee. ㊅ Regarding the case of the fund custody regulations, it was decided that because it was late, the regulations would be discussed and passed at the next meeting. Currently, Zhuang Dingxun, Liu Qinlin, Chi Yunfei, Lin Qingchi, and Zhu Lide were elected as temporary custody members, with Director Chi as the convener. The meeting adjourned at around 7:00 pm.

### It is Really Difficult to Add a Branch Market to the Shanghai Fish Market

Improving Equipment is Progressing Step by Step

According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Fish Market Council of the Ministry of Industry, in response to the request of the fish merchants, added a branch market at the 16th Pier. The main reason for this was the inconvenience of transportation to the fish market and the lack of perfect pier equipment. The Council discussed and agreed and submitted it to the Ministry for approval. Recently, another letter was received from the fish merchants, stating several opinions on improving the equipment of the existing market, but the matter of establishing a branch market was not mentioned. The reporter learned from the Council that it is really difficult to add a branch market, and the fish merchants seem to have abandoned their request. However, the improvement of equipment is always in the plan, such as facilitating transportation, expanding the pier, etc., even if the fish merchants do not express their opinions, it will be automatically carried out step by step. In the past, due to the occurrence of several capsized fishing boats, the fish merchants even complained about the market. However, in order to quell the situation, the Council compensated them. Therefore, the market's service to the merchants and the public has made them feel convenient and satisfied.

### Disturbance on Nanjing Road Amidst British Coronation Celebrations

Smashed Glass Windows of the Great World Company; Culprits Lightly Punished by the Court

To celebrate the coronation of the British monarch, the British military in Shanghai held a celebration ceremony at the Racecourse. The 10th was the day for rehearsals of various programs involving the British army and navy stationed in Shanghai, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and other participants in the celebration. The British expatriates and citizens who came to watch filled the venue shoulder to shoulder. The evening before was the start of the formal celebrations. The Racecourse and its surroundings were packed with people. Moreover, all British-owned companies and shops decorated their doors and rooftops with lights. At dusk, all the electric lights were turned on, resembling a city that never sleeps, a spectacle unprecedented in scale. The Public Concession Police Department, to maintain order, pre-selected capable Chinese, Western, Japanese, and Indian detectives from its affiliated police stations to cooperate with the detectives from the Central, Old Zhabei, and New Zhabei police stations, patrolling the Bund, Nanjing Road, Yu Qiaqing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and Ma Houchao Road. The hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues located around the Racecourse had all their rooms reserved in advance. These establishments, due to their proximity to the performance venue, saw an opportunity to hoard, temporarily increasing their prices, thus tripling their profits. Around 8 PM the night before, the balconies and rooftops of these establishments facing the road were filled with figures, and the road was constantly bustling with pedestrians. Only trams and buses were allowed to operate as usual on Nanjing Road, Yu Qiaqing Road, and Jing'an Temple Road near the Racecourse. Other vehicles were not allowed to cross this boundary. After 8 PM, the number of tourists increased, leaving no space to stand. As a result, some frivolous individuals took the opportunity to harass young women in the crowd, causing some women to have their clothes torn and lose their hairpins. The area in front of the Great World Company was the most crowded. Those watching from the balconies witnessed these acts of mischief and poured water on the crowd. To vent their anger, those who were splashed threw bricks and stones at the company, damaging three large window panes, with losses estimated at 750 yuan. The company's staff, along with detectives, arrested six stone-throwers. Thirteen others were also arrested on suspicion of causing trouble, eleven of whom had minor head injuries. Unexpectedly, a fire alarm suddenly went off at the New World Company. By the time the fire brigade arrived, the fire had been extinguished, adding to the commotion. Yesterday morning, the police sent the nineteen arrested individuals to the First Special District Court. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu, representing the police, charged them under Articles 354 and 150 of the criminal code, describing the chaotic situation at the time. After questioning by Judge Pan, Wang Wan'de and Min Chatao were sentenced to 20 days of detention each, and Ju Wanggen, Shen Fuxiang, Lu Meixin, and Xu Rongfu were sentenced to 15 days of detention each. The remaining thirteen, including Guo Ruiren, were acquitted.

### Wuxi Native Association Sends Funds to Support Suiyuan

The Wuxi Native Association in Shanghai launched a fundraising campaign among fellow natives to support the arduous battle in Suiyuan. They have now collected a substantial amount and received donations totaling 559 yuan and 23 cents. This amount has been handed over to the Bank of China to be remitted to General Fu Zuoyi, Chairman of Suiyuan Province, for distribution to the front lines to provide support. The association's telegram to General Fu Zuoyi is as follows: "General Fu Zuoyi of Suiyuan, admired for your loyalty and deeply revered. Since the outbreak of the Suiyuan War, the entire nation has been filled with anguish. Under the guidance of the central government, you have demonstrated patriotism and fought against the enemy with courage, achieving victories everywhere. A natural hero, you are a pillar of the nation. We, the Wuxi natives residing in Shanghai, look to the frontier with deep concern. Fortunately, you are guarding the Great Wall and defending the country, and we hope that the invaders will be quickly eliminated for the good of the nation and its people. We have raised 559 yuan and 23 cents in national currency, which we are remitting to your headquarters through the Bank of China to express our sincere support and boost the morale of the soldiers. This small amount is insignificant, but it represents the hard work and blood of the people. We hope you will accept it and provide a receipt. Respectfully, the Wuxi Native Association of Shanghai."

### Attempted River Rescue Ends in Double Drowning

Near the Yichang Road bridge in the Suzhou Creek, there are many makeshift shelters. At 5 AM the day before, Chen Kaiju, a resident of one of the shelters, went to the pier to draw water but lost his balance and fell into the river. A neighbor, Chen Xiaowuzi, witnessed this and immediately jumped into the water to help. However, both of them were not good swimmers and drowned almost instantly. Their families discovered the incident and began searching. It was not until 7 PM that evening that Chen Kaiju's body was recovered, while Xiaowuzi's body was still missing. Yesterday, Li Wenqi, a detective from the water patrol police station, took the deceased's body and his wife, Ms. Chen, to the local court for an official autopsy. The body was then handed over to the wife for burial. It is reported that the deceased was 31 years old, from Yancheng, and worked in a Japanese yarn factory there.

### Seducing Another Man's Wife and Then Committing Arson

Wang Tongmao is Despicable

Xu Tianshou, a 34-year-old laborer from Huai'an, lived in a thatched house at No. 76 South of the Ice Factory Field on Dongchang Road, Pudong. His wife, Ms. Yu, was 33 years old. Due to her weak will, she was seduced into adultery by Wang Tongmao, a fellow townsman who lived in a thatched house at No. 95 in the new settlement. They secretly met from time to time, unbeknownst to Xu. On the morning of February 23 of this year, Xu got up early for work and went out. Not long after leaving, he returned home to put on warmer clothes because of the cold. He suddenly saw Wang and his wife sleeping together. Overcome with jealousy, he was about to confront Wang when Wang jumped up, beat Xu severely, and left. Several days later, Wang took the opportunity to lure Ms. Yu to a small inn in Puxi, where they lived together for half a month. Ms. Yu, thinking of her husband's kindness, deeply regretted her past mistakes and seized an opportunity to escape back to her home in Pudong. Wang, seeing that she had left, secretly plotted revenge. Around 8 PM the night before, he carried a paper roll and two boxes of matches and sneaked to the outside of Xu's house to set it on fire. He was caught in the act by Xu, who called the police and had him arrested at the Pudong Branch Bureau. According to the plaintiff couple, Wang seduced and had an affair and then set fire to their house. In his defense, Wang claimed that he was asking the plaintiff for three cents in gambling debts, which he refused to pay, falsely accusing him of seduction and arson. The bureau chief, believing that three cents of gambling debt would not lead to accusations of adultery and arson, concluded that the defendant was lying. He ordered the case to be sent to the local court for further investigation.

### Xi Rao Jia Cuo Promotes Sino-Tibetan Buddhist Understanding

Since responding to the invitation from local Buddhist groups in Shanghai, Xi Rao Jia Cuo, the great Geshe of Tibet, has been lecturing on Buddhism at the Jueyuan Pure Karma Society on Hart Road starting from the 10th of this month. Here is a follow-up report on the situation: ㊀ Since Xi Rao Jia Cuo began lecturing on Buddhism on the 10th, he continued to speak on the three essentials of the path yesterday. He will finish lecturing on the 15th, transmit the refuge vows on the 16th, and bestow the long-life empowerment on the 17th, which is a Tibetan custom of baptism said to dispel misfortune. After the lectures are completed, it is undecided whether he will visit Mount Putuo and other mountains to visit temples or return to Beijing, according to Xi's secretary, Zhang Zhifu. ㊁ It is also learned that the Bodhi Society in Shanghai has a translation center in Longhua dedicated to translating Tibetan scriptures. However, without scholars who have extensively studied Tibetan classics and are proficient in both exoteric and esoteric teachings to lead the work, it will be difficult to fully explore their depths. Therefore, the society has obtained Xi's consent to oversee the translation and organization work, thereby promoting Sino-Tibetan Buddhist understanding.

### Mother-in-Law Flees with Daughter; Son-in-Law Sues for Interference with Family

Case Transferred to the Second Special Court Due to Jurisdictional Error; Mother-in-Law Accuses Zhou Zibin of Seduction

Huang Guifang, also known as Zhu Huangshi, a 36-year-old woman from Zhenjiang, was originally married to Zhu Yinfu. After their divorce, she had a daughter named Zhu Aying, now 17 years old. In June of last year, through the introduction of Dong Jiu'an, a man from Hangzhou, Aying became engaged to Wang Guangde (23 years old), a native of Zhenjiang and partner in the Guangyisheng Chinese medicine store on Wuzhou Road. They were married on November 11 and lived together at No. 74 Mintiniyin Road Village in the French Concession. Unexpectedly, Zhu Yinfu, Huang Guifang's ex-husband, intervened and dragged Huang to the Wenmiao Road Police Station, which then transferred her to the local court. Because the matter concerned a dispute over marriage rights and did not involve criminal matters, the court ruled that it would not accept the case. After mediation, Wang Guangde paid Zhu Yinfu 30 yuan as compensation, settling the matter. From then on, Wang and Aying had a very harmonious relationship, and Huang Guifang lived with her son-in-law. However, recently, Huang and her daughter often went out, and now they have become even more brazen, often not returning all night. After Wang slightly admonished them, Huang and Aying took their clothes and disappeared on the 27th of last month. Wang reported the matter to the French police for investigation, but they have not been found. Wang then hired lawyer Fan Ming to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court against Huang for interference with family, requesting that she be punished under Article 240, Paragraph 3, and Article 320, Paragraph 1, of the criminal code, and that she be ordered to return his daughter and the stolen clothing. Yesterday, the criminal division chief of the court, Qian Hongye, held a hearing on the case. Because the residences of both the plaintiff and defendant, the place of marriage, and the location of the crime were all within the jurisdiction of the Second Special Court, the court ruled that the case should be filed with the Second Special Court. Lawyer Fan requested that the case be transferred, and Judge Qian agreed to transfer the case to the Second Special Court for trial due to jurisdictional error. Recently, Huang Guifang also filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court against Zhou Zibin, father of Zhou Jiaqi of the Guangyisheng Chinese medicine store, accusing him of seduction and abandonment, claiming that Zhou had seduced her to the Great China Hotel and had sexual relations with her. She also claimed that they lived together at No. 2 Xianglin Lane on Qiujiang Road, No. 304 Wangzhi Road, and No. 6 Tongchang Lane on Haining Road. At the same time, she pointed out that Wang Guangde was Zhou Zibin's son, Zhou Zhengming. This case was also heard yesterday by Judge Feng of the Special Court. Zhou Zibin absolutely denied having any relationship with Huang and claimed that Wang Guangde was not his son, nor was he named Zhou, but only a disciple. Because the case still required investigation, the court ordered it to be rescheduled for another hearing. Departure, inspection locations: ㊀ Shashi, ㊁ Yichang, ㊂ Wanxian, ㊃ Chongqing, ㊄ Chengdu. Take a steamer directly to Chongqing from this city, then take a highway bus to Chengdu. After completing the task, take a highway bus back to Chongqing, then transfer to a steamer to Wanxian, Yichang, and Shashi before returning to Shanghai. Inspection Tasks: ㊀ Investigate and compare the sales volume of national goods and foreign goods in various ports along the Yangtze River in recent years, the dynamics of national goods sales in each port, the situation of national goods factories and organizations in various regions, the psychology and preferences of local men and women towards national goods, and their evaluations after using various products. Conduct separate discussions among various classes to obtain genuine opinions and attitudes for the reference of national goods factories. ㊁ Promote the current state of production in various national goods factories in Shanghai and the progress made in their products in recent years. Provide detailed reports on the progress of the national goods movement in Shanghai so that each port can learn from them and know what to emulate. ㊂ Establish close contact with local officials, industry and commerce education institutions, women's groups, and organizations that promote national goods in each place to prepare for continuous communication in the future and to work together to promote the national goods movement further. ㊃ Promote the future plans of the joint national goods company and encourage enthusiastic national goods advocates and leaders in industry and commerce to organize the following practical businesses in their respective regions: national goods companies, national goods factories, joint business offices, national goods introduction centers, national goods promotion centers, and native product and national goods exchange centers. ㊁ Advocate or use national goods organizations, such as women's national goods use associations, etc., and bring together national goods factories to engage in production and sales cooperation and effectively connect local products with manufactured products to expand trade between provinces.

### Ministry of Industry's Commodity Inspection Bureau to Reorganize into Animal Epidemic Prevention Institute

Approved to Take Effect on July 1st

According to the Ministry of Industry's Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, starting from July of the second year, the Shanghai Blood Serum Manufacturing Year will be renamed the "Animal Epidemic Prevention Institute jointly operated by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry's Agricultural Experimental Institute." The institute engages in research on war epidemic prevention and treatment of livestock in various regions, earning the trust of society. It has repeatedly designed and guided livestock conservation projects for provinces such as Sichuan and Guangdong and established animal epidemic prevention experimental zones in Taixing and Dongyang. It has achieved considerable results in animal epidemic prevention. Later, it was ordered to merge the institute into the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department of the Central Agricultural Institute and to change the prevention institute into an epidemic prevention experimental zone. After repeated consultations, the bureau and the institute decided to reorganize the jointly operated Shanghai Animal Epidemic Prevention Institute on July 1st of this year, incorporating the existing equipment for blood serum manufacturing and technical personnel into the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department of the Experimental Institute. However, due to the highly developed dairy industry in Shanghai and the fact that most dairy cows nationwide are purchased from this region, the presence or absence of diseases in dairy cows is extremely important to the safety of edible milk and public health. The institute felt that the livestock protection business in Shanghai was of great importance to the health of the population. Therefore, it proposed to rename the Shanghai Animal Epidemic Prevention Institute as the Livestock Improvement Institute after the merger, to be managed by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, specializing in livestock improvement matters in Shanghai. This plan is scheduled to take effect on July 1, 1937. The bureau and institute jointly submitted it to the Ministry of Industry for review and approval in February and received approval on March 6. The original director of the Prevention Institute, Cheng Zhaojiong, also resigned from his concurrent position and was transferred back to the Agricultural Experimental Institute to serve as the director of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department, with Chen Yingding taking over the vacant position.

Each department of seamen was ordered to bring their families to watch. More than 1,000 people attended. Before the film screening, Director Liu Huogong of the department gave a brief speech, stating, "The purpose of inviting you here today is to watch movies, which is a form of entertainment. Generally speaking, the department, standing in the position of leading the masses, should only encourage the masses to work hard, endure hardship, and save the country during this time of national crisis. How can we lead you in entertainment? You should know that the motivation for this film screening is not to promote entertainment, but to encourage seamen to love their country and their race. The screening of 'The Xi'an Incident' is to let everyone know the truth that our highest leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, remained calm and composed even in a desperate situation. That kind of fearless spirit can't help but make those who watch it feel respect and increase their enthusiasm for supporting the leader. The screening of 'Autumn Exercise' is to let everyone know that our country's army is an army with principles, organization, and discipline. Everyone only knows about the country and doesn't know about themselves. They are not only charging forward, but even if they are going through fire and water, they are not afraid. We should emulate their martial spirit and strive for the country and the nation." The audience was deeply moved. The films ended at around 10 PM, and the audience dispersed.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Pays Attention to Wharf Petty Theft

Cooperating with the French Public Works Department to Rectify

Regarding the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's replacement of the Jin Shengyuan Wharf patrol, the person in charge of the company stated: "The Jin Liyuan Wharf is the only important wooden wharf of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. This wharf is the one used by the Bureau's ships for berthing, so passengers and goods from all over the Yangtze River and the North and South Seas are concentrated here. Its business development is also the best among all the wharves in this port. However, many petty thieves are always lurking in the area, making it impossible to maintain order, thus forming a special area for them to hide. As a result, cases of theft of passengers and goods occur almost every day. Even after goods are lost, if the cargo owner can pay a small fee, the lost items can be recovered. There are also those who deliberately damage goods and take the opportunity to steal them. The Bureau, in view of this, and in order to rectify the situation, held an examination for the wharf patrol in March of this year, eliminating them once and then training them, in order to encourage those who are retained to work diligently. The intention cannot be said to be unkind. However, the results have been minimal in the past month, indicating that the patrol officers retained after this screening are not working effectively and are also suspected of favoritism and indulgence. The Bureau deeply feels that if there is no thorough rectification, the theft trend will not be slightly reduced. Not only will it be impossible to face the merchants and the society, but also the country's capital will not be guaranteed. Therefore, it is determined to dismiss all the old patrol officers of the wharf in order to innovate. However, because the area is located in the French Concession, according to past practice, the national police can only exercise their functions on the river surface, while the land police power in the French Concession is controlled by the French Public Works Department. Therefore, the reorganization of the wharf can only be thoroughly accomplished through cooperation between the two sides. The French Concession authorities cannot effectively maintain the local security of the area without this cooperation. It is heard that the Bureau has conducted detailed research with the French Public Works Department, agreed on cooperation methods, and decided to adopt the petition police system. On the one hand, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will select and hire the patrol officers, and on the other hand, it will instruct them to register with the Public Works Department as petition police, directly directing and supervising them. It is also heard that the former patrol officers handed over their firearms and uniforms separately the day before yesterday."

### Dental Groups Public Lecture Meeting

### Husband and Wife Agree to Divorce, Mutually Wishing Each Other a Bright Future

The Wife Even Wanted to Invite Her Husband for Lunch, But Due to Other Engagements, They Shook Hands and Parted Ways

Huang Linqi, a native of Shaoxing, is 33 years old and currently resides at No. 60, Lane 142, Tangshan Road, Hongkou. His wife, Shen Wenying, is 22 years old and resides at No. 46, Sazhu Lane, North Big Dipper. The couple has been married for four years, but less than four months after their wedding, Huang Linqi was implicated in a drug case and sentenced to four years in prison. However, after serving less than three years, he was released on parole last November. Due to the couple's limited time together and frequent separations, their opinions diverged, and they each had their own concerns, making it difficult to reconcile. They were able to reach an agreement to divorce on their own. Since only one lawyer could provide proof, and the law required proof from at least two people for it to be valid, they decided that Shen Wenying would file a divorce petition with the local court. Yesterday, both parties appeared in court. Without questioning the reasons, they both stated that they had already agreed to divorce outside of court and had come to the court to ask for proof. The court then made a record of the divorce in court, which both parties signed before leaving. Afterwards, Shen Wenying even invited Huang Linqi to lunch as a final farewell. However, Huang had other business with his lawyer, so they shook hands, wished each other a bright future, and parted ways. It is truly one of the most beautiful chapters in the history of divorce.

### Gao Yunhe Assaulted Due to Gambling Dispute

Six Assailants Arrested

At No. 17 Renchang Lane, Qiwupu Road, a man named Zhou Changde from Anhui recently gathered a crowd to gamble on Pai Gow. At 11:50 PM the night before last, a man from Ningbo named Gao Yunhe joined the game and had a dispute with the dealer after losing. He left angrily. Zhou Changde, fearing that he would report them, had more than ten of his fellow villagers, including Liu Jinxian, Mei Defu, Chen Guozhong, Wang Akang, Pan Longhai, and Wu Shuzhi, follow him. They surrounded Gao at the entrance of Renchang Lane and beat him to the ground with benches and other weapons, without asking any questions, before fleeing into No. 68 and No. 70 in the lane and hiding upstairs to observe the situation. Gao Yunhe was seriously injured and barely breathing. Chinese constable No. 2970 and two Western constables, No. 250 and No. 276, who were on duty nearby, heard the alarm and arrived. They were unable to arrest the assailants, so they hired a car to take the injured man to the Shanghai East Hospital for treatment. Later, Gao Yunhe's companion, Xie Linzhang from Taixing, found out where Liu Jinxian and the other five were hiding and notified the Chinese and Western constables, who arrested them at their addresses and took them to the Yulin Road Police Station. Zhou Changde, who was arrested on the 17th, had already escaped without a trace, and the gambling equipment could not be found. This morning, Liu Jinxian and his gang were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and requested a postponement. The defendants' statements were evasive and they all denied injuring Gao. Judge Xiao ordered them to be returned to custody pending the victim's recovery for further investigation.

### Two People Take Poison

Their Lives are in Danger

Liu Zhou, a 22-year-old woman from Sichuan, rented a room at No. 213 Shengyi Wharf Street, Nanshi. At about 2:00 AM yesterday morning, she suddenly felt a headache while sleeping soundly and intended to take the Bagua Dan pills placed on the table in front of her bed. Because she was sleepy-eyed, she mistakenly took three opium residue pills placed there by her husband. Her husband discovered this and she was barely breathing. He immediately hired a car to take her to the hospital for treatment. It is said that she took too much poison and her life is in danger.

### Grand View Garden Model Exhibition

Starting Yesterday at the Great New Company

The novel "Dream of the Red Chamber" is widely popular. Its narration and romance are excellent, and its depiction of gardens, pavilions, winding corridors is also fascinating. It is not only a marvel of fiction, but also an excellent reference material for studying the old-style architecture and garden structure of our country. The Grand View Garden panoramic model made by Yunfen Layman is on display. Each flower, stone, couplet, area, and window sill is based on the "Dream of the Red Chamber." The entire garden, ponds, and pavilions are made of silk and brocade, shining and pleasing to the eye. The stories are interspersed and the characters are arranged, such as Xiangyun sleeping on a stone, Daiyu burying flowers, and Granny Liu getting drunk in Yihongyuan, etc., all lifelike. It is truly a treasure of art. It was previously exhibited publicly in Tianjin to raise money for flood relief in the Yellow River and was a great event at the time.

A small fee will be charged to maintain the venue. It is expected to be a lively event.

### Lawyer Huang Jue Indicted for Issuing Bad Checks

Dispute over Club Funds with His Secretary; Repeated Absences Led to Arrest

Huang Jue, a 50-year-old lawyer from Suzhou, formerly practiced law in this city, with an office on the upper floor of the Silk Industry Bank on Sanma Road. In the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), he gave his secretary, Shen Baoyi, a check for 260 yuan in payment of club fees. When the check bounced, Shen, after fruitless negotiations, filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special Third Court, accusing Huang Jue of fraud by issuing a bad check. Huang failed to appear in court. Meanwhile, they reached a settlement out of court, with Huang paying 50 yuan in cash and issuing another check for the remaining 210 yuan, with a specified date for cashing. Shen then withdrew his suit. Later, Shen Baoyi again filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, accusing Huang Jue of forging documents, claiming that the money from the previous case had been repaid through Zhu Jingqing, but Huang had used a blank sheet of paper bearing his signature to write a document withdrawing the previous fraud suit and submitting it to the court. Shen requested a trial. The court accepted the complaint and summoned Huang, but he had already left Shanghai and could not be reached. The case was suspended for over three years. Shen Baoyi eventually discovered that Huang was practicing law in Suzhou, with an office on the second floor of the Guohuo Company in the North Bureau of Suzhou. Last month, Shen petitioned the Special Second Court to summon Huang. The court entrusted the Wu County District Court to serve the summons. Huang failed to appear. The Special Second Court then instructed the Wu County District Court to arrest Huang and hold him on bail. Yesterday, Chen Shuoying of the Special Second Court presided over the trial. The plaintiff, Shen Baoyi, stated that in the previous case of fraud by issuing a bad check, mediated by Yun Lu, Huang had first paid 50 yuan and issued another check, agreeing to complete the formalities by May 15th and have Shen withdraw the suit on the 16th. Unexpectedly, Huang did not complete the formalities but instead used a blank sheet of paper with Shen's signature from a previous case to write a document on Shen's behalf, unilaterally submitting it to the court to withdraw the suit. Shen learned of this and filed a complaint for forgery. The defendant, Huang Jue, accompanied by his defense lawyer, appeared in court and denied the forgery. He claimed that after the mediation in the previous case, the plaintiff had written the draft of the withdrawal statement himself, which his secretary had copied. He didn't know who had delivered it to the court and presented a draft of the plaintiff's statement to the court. Shen denied writing the draft, saying that Huang had written it at the time, and he had modified it. The judge ordered Shen to write numbers in court to compare the handwriting. The judge then informed Huang that his challenge to jurisdiction was denied, as the investigation had determined that the crime had occurred within the court's jurisdiction, and therefore it could accept the case. At this point, the court determined that the facts were clear, ordered closing arguments, and announced that the verdict would be delivered at 2:00 PM on the 15th. The defendant posted a 1,000-yuan bond. The actual defense lawyer was instructed to submit a supplementary bail application the following day.

### "Bride Schools"

— Shen Jiaqian

Ms. Okada Tokuko, a famous fashion design instructor from Tokyo, Japan, arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru a few days ago. She plans to set up a "Bride School" similar to those in Japan. It is said that the address has been chosen at the Household Handicraft Association on North Sichuan Road.

It is said that "Bride Schools" are very common in Japan. The courses taught are nothing more than common knowledge about raising newborns, cooking and tailoring methods, and the arrangement of seasonal flowers. These subjects are better described as "common knowledge for housewives" rather than "common knowledge for brides." Japanese women are called 'the most virtuous women,' perhaps because they have been educated in "Bride Schools" and have gained a great reputation?

Not long ago, a commentary reporter from the women's section of the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun and Kiyoko Ishihara, a reporter from the Toyo Keizai Shimbun, held a Sino-Japanese women's forum hosted by the YMCA of Eight Immortals Bridge. In her speech, she said, "China, in my eyes, is much more advanced than the China I imagined. In particular, Chinese women have equal status with men in politics." Although this is a remark that every "foreign guest" who comes to China can tactfully use, since the May Fourth Movement, many Chinese women have indeed been released from the kitchen and are doing practical work. However, it seems impossible to infer from this what the actual status of Chinese women is at home or internationally. The three-inch golden lotus is praised abroad, the "ideal partner" is finally found in China, and now Okada Tokuko is coming to Shanghai to set up a "Bride School." This is precisely "we are like fish in muddy water, living in a daze, inexplicable."

Now let's talk about the so-called "Bride School." Judging from the above-mentioned subjects, most women in our country can understand these "common knowledge for brides," and it is also the "inherent virtue" of Chinese women. Why bother Ms. Okada Tokuko to preach in the Eastern style? I think Ms. Okada Tokuko will see this situation as soon as she unpacks and regret this trip? But she is fortunate to have come to Shanghai. Shanghai has a group of women who are somewhere between the "equal status with men in politics" mentioned by Ishihara Kiyoko and the "common knowledge that a bride should have" that Okada Tokuko wants to preach. They really need a "Bride School" to learn some authentic "common knowledge that a bride should have," such as the design of wedding dresses, the study of wedding marches, makeup techniques, and everything else, with styles that strive to be beautiful and attitudes that are generous; and Ms. Okada Tokuko is originally a famous "fashion design instructor." If she can change her original intention and adapt to the trend, the "Bride School" may not be able to produce many talents and make a lot of money; at the same time, the Shanghai bride is also very fortunate.

However, what kind of "impression of Chinese brides" she will publish after returning home is not within the scope of this article.

### Joining the Fun

— Hua Cun

After talking about "watching the fun," I feel that it is necessary to talk about "joining the fun."

There are people who are addicted to watching the fun, and at the same time, there are people who make a living by joining in the fun. The former does nothing, while the latter does something.

People who like to join in the fun always have a smiling face, are enthusiastic and generous, like the Buddha Han Shi. At some celebrity banquets and gatherings with "Sun Yat-sen's portrait" hanging, we can always see these smiling faces, but sometimes they are also nervously serious, swaying around like flies.

As soon as an important person steps down, they launch a farewell party to show their attachment. In the farewell speech, they express their gratitude and tears, saying that with his departure, what will happen to the people! But the next day, as soon as another important person takes office, they call on their friends and relatives, holding flags, and swaggering to the dock to welcome them. And they also want to hold a tea party, desperately applauding the new noble, saying that with your arrival, it is the blessing of the people, really like rain after a long drought, nothing could be better! While saying goodbye, while welcoming, they are always so busy.

In addition, they follow the will of heaven, or are passionately indignant, and hold a meeting to denounce rebellion: or they are encouraged and joyful, and send a telegram of support. They inquire about how old a certain important person is this year, and they are old and virtuous, so they should launch a birthday celebration; a certain celebrity has been married to his wife for several years, and fortunately the concubines are full of the room, but the virtuous wife has not yet been divorced, so they rush up to participate in the silver or golden wedding anniversary.

However, these are all high-level. Those of a medium level go to the newspapers to write articles, praising virtues: they act as receptionists at meetings, wearing a silk flower on their lapel, rushing around in the crowd, sweating profusely. Seeing their peers, they smile, wipe their sweat, and frown, observing their expressions, as if there is resentment, but in fact it is triumph.

For events like the coronation ceremony of the British Emperor, these gentlemen have no "official duties," so they squeeze into the ranks of the foreigners, respectfully and admiringly sitting there as "high-class Chinese" to participate in the grand event!

They are always busy, the host is busy, they help, joining in the fun: the host is idle, they talk nonsense, acting as guests. The official Ximen in "Jin Ping Mei" is always surrounded by this kind of sensible character.

When Yingying marries, Hongniang is busy. Because whipping to peers and joining in the fun for the host are the virtues of slaves—this has a nice name, called "adding to the fun."

With these kinds of Chinese descendants who are good at "adding to the fun," the world is peaceful and the Republic of China lives forever!

### Creepers on Mount Tai

— Ma Feng

"Sir, don't lean back. You think this makes it easier for us to walk, but—it doesn't give us any strength!"

Sitting on the mountain sedan chair coming down from the South Heavenly Gate, looking at the high blue sky and the deep valley-like stone steps, I couldn't help but feel panic in my heart. --This is really not a game. Dangerous! Looking at the two "creepers" walking down the stone steps in a row, gliding down very easily, my heart shrank even more—if they slipped, then…. Uncomfortably sitting on the mountain sedan chair, these bad thoughts revolved in my mind.

"Sir, don't worry! You don't know: you can't go down the mountain any other way! Stepping on the stones and sliding down step by step, it is natural and not tiring at all!"

Although I was still afraid in my heart; I couldn't say anything more. I knew that they had some taboos about these things. Turning my face to look at the South Heavenly Gate, which seemed to be located in the clouds, I felt the sedan chair shaking -- the shadow of the South Heavenly Gate was gone! It turned a full circle. It turned out that the two creepers were "changing shoulders," and my heart couldn't help but thump again. Rubbing my eyes, seeing their calm expressions, I lightly exhaled—

"Oh! That scared me to death!"

"Sir, don't worry, we are 'creepers' who make a living by relying on the mountain! In previous years, except for not going up the mountain in winter, we really went up and down thirty or forty times a month! Business was extremely good! Everyone could have food, drink, and use, and also support a large family! Now...now...the money we earn is really a handful of crumbs. The years are bad, who has the money to spend on coming to the mountain? What can we do? Now our business has been taken away by the railway hotel! For example, every year foreigners come to visit the mountain, we can make two more, but they set the price: the same day round trip, three yuan! One yuan has to be deducted from them from this three yuan..."

As they were talking, we had already arrived at Yunbu Bridge. The stone bridge under the bridge and the section of road to Zhongtianmen were all washed away by the water. When I got out of the mountain sedan chair and walked, I asked him how it got to this point.

"This was washed away by a heavy rain on June 24th! People on the mountain said that it was the Dragon King's heavenly water, and three people drowned below, including a teacher! It is being repaired now."

Walking down this section of the road, the two creepers started walking one in front of the other—the road was gradually leveling out. It was no longer as cold as it was above. So I started chatting with them, pulling east and west:

"Besides the Dai Temple, what other famous places are there in Taian City?"

"Besides the Dai Temple, the famous things in Taian are 'cabbage, tofu, and water'!"

His answer was superfluous. I had tasted these three famous things in Taian: the water really had a different taste, the cabbage had no residue when eaten, and the various patterns and dishes made of tofu were "squeaky." But what I was asking about was not——the creeper next to him said:

"People are asking you about famous places! Sir, there is a very famous thing in Taian County, can you guess what it is? It is the kneeling statue of the former county magistrate! A statue made of iron, it is the kneeling statue of county magistrate Feng Ruji! He was the county magistrate here during Zhang Zongchang's time! He was a corrupt official who almost scraped away all the land in Taian. When he left, the common people, in order to commemorate him for the county magistrates who came later, each contributed a copper plate and put together a statue of him made of iron, kneeling at the gate of the county government! There are two foreign money-like things on his lapel, with the words 'foreign money' on them. These two words are also meaningful: because the county magistrate had two people to help him scrape the land, one was named Yang and one was named Qian! The one named Yang was a local, and fearing it would be ugly, he took out money and bribed them to change it to the word 'foreign'!"

I felt that this matter was quite interesting and asked him:

"Why hasn't anyone told me about this?"

"How would I lie to you! It's true, if you don't believe me, ask him—" As he walked, he stretched out his hand from his belt and pointed to his companion. "If you don't, ask in the city—it won't be wrong at all! Sir hasn't heard people say it, because people who come here don't pay attention to other things; they only know about Mount Tai...Later, this kneeling statue of Feng Ruji disappeared, can you guess how? He spent money and took advantage of the war between the Southern Army and the Jin Army to bury it! Later, it was dug out again and placed in Ximen, it is still there now!"

Sitting on the mountain sedan chair swaying, savoring this interesting story, I couldn't help but laugh.

When we arrived at Doumu Palace, we stopped outside for a drink of tea. I went to Doumu Palace to see the famous nuns. One of them was really beautiful, her figure and demeanor were really enchanting. Thinking of the story about the nuns in Doumu Palace written in the second collection of "The Travels of Lao Can," I felt that Liu Tieyun wrote it too realistically. The very beautiful nun was sewing a brightly colored red underwear on the table in front of the Buddhist hall. When I wanted to secretly take a picture of her, she discovered it—and ran to the back room. When walking down, I talked to the two creepers about the nuns in Doumu Palace—

"You think they are strange for making bright red clothes? Heh, damn it, they are really some whores! If you have money, they can live——"

Talking about this, the two creepers became interested. They told me some of their things without any politeness. I thought of the record in the newspaper about "nuns in Taian County lending themselves to give birth"——

"That's not here, that's in ×× Ban (I don't remember the name clearly) nunnery, thirty miles northeast of the city! The nuns there still have braids! If you want to see the nuns, hey, it's best to come in March, naturally in the lunar March, the 14th, 15th, and 16th are the birthday of the Goddess of Mount Tai, and the big opera is performed on the mountain, and the nuns near the mountain all come! Some with braids, some with their hair combed and oiled, and their faces smeared with rouge and powder..."

——See Northward Journey

When the train left the not-so-magnificent Taian Station and continued to advance into the vast northern plains, we discovered new miracles on the earth walls along both sides of the railway.

"Look, why are there so many Japanese advertisements?"

Yun angrily expressed the indignation of the southerners.

"Shandong has also been drawn into the special circle." The hearts of the group were tightly entwined with the same feeling, silently gazing out the car windows at the advertisements that were rare to see in the south and seemed to have no end.

Gynecological Holy Medicine: Chujo-to

Baochi Yili Jin

University Eye Drops

Old Du Eye Drops

Onimisu Bedbug Repellent

We felt very sad, like grief but also like anger; the same thought floated in our hearts, the country is getting smaller and smaller.

"I heard that their sales are not bad"

A Shandong native in the same car told us:

"So the people have forgotten their hatred for Japan?"

Yun asked sadly.

"No, but the Japanese have great propaganda power and the goods are cheap. When people are sick, they use whatever they see."

"Then what about China's own medicines?" Yun asked抢着.

"How many of your own products have you seen?" The Shandong native grinned, revealing a mouthful of black teeth. The strong smell of scallions startled Yun, who was standing opposite him, and he retreated to the car window and spat several times. "Moreover, the price is also expensive!"

...The train rumbled over the iron bridge. Lying under the iron bridge was the riverbed, which was typical of the north, dry like a desert, with two deep wheel tracks.

Looking at the boundless yellow field stretching out under the blue sky, we pondered in disappointment...
