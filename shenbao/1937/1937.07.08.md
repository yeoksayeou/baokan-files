### Mock Manchukuo Participating in the World Church Conference - We Plan to Lodge Protests with Various Countries

If Japan Dares to Commit This Outrage - They Should Bear the Responsibility for Disrupting the Conference

[Guling] Regarding the incident of Tadasa Tokutomi, the Secretary-General of the Tokyo World Education Conference Affairs Bureau, actually allowing the puppet Manchukuo to participate specially in the World Church Conference, all educational figures gathered in Lushan expressed extreme indignation. According to powerful figures in the educational circles here, the members invited to attend this executive committee meeting were generally limited to those who participated in the previous Oxford Conference. Since the puppet Manchukuo is neither a member nor has it requested to join the conference, how can it be allowed to attend freely? Dr. Paul Monroe, the president of the World Church Conference, and Mr. Tadasa have repeatedly and officially made this statement. However, now Mr. Tadasa has disregarded international credibility and changed his previous decision, which is very incomprehensible. If Japan dares to commit this outrage and allow the puppet Manchukuo to attend, disrupting this international conference that promotes world friendship and peace, the responsibility should be borne by them. Our delegation will not attend and will lodge protests with people from various countries at the World Church Conference to express our most serious concerns. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Reasons for Prosecutor's Appeal in the Liu Luyin Case

"Criminal Motives Still Need to Be Investigated - A Ten-Year Prison Sentence Is Too Light"

[Hankou] The reasons for the prosecutor's appeal in the Wuhan District Court regarding Liu Luyin's case are that the original judgment disregarded the charge that Liu committed the crime of inciting murder and disrupting order, which is obviously inappropriate. Furthermore, in terms of sentencing, the circumstances must be investigated and fairness must be sought. Whether Liu's criminal motives were due to a lack of understanding of the Central Government's hard work in planning for the country still needs to be investigated. Only imposing the minimum prison sentence of ten years is too light, and using many years of revolution as a reason for leniency in sentencing is also inappropriate. (7th Special Dispatch)

### Japan's Firm Stance on the Heilongjiang Island Dispute

Retaining Ownership of Both Islands, Disregarding Russian Protests

[Tokyo] The Japanese authorities are currently taking a firm stance on the issue of the two Heilongjiang islands. The Soviet government is very dissatisfied because Japanese troops advanced to the two islands after the Soviet troops withdrew. Although no official information has been received regarding this matter, the authorities intend that even if this claim is accurate, they will not accept the Soviet government's protest, as the two islands have long belonged to "Manchukuo." After the Soviet troops withdrew, "Manchukuo" should naturally reclaim them. A spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated today that "Manchukuo" has full freedom to station troops anywhere within its territory, and "Manchukuo" undeniably owns the two islands. Therefore, there is no need for further negotiations on the issue of sovereignty over the two islands. According to an official report from Moscow, the Soviet government protested to Mr. Nishi, the Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, on July 6th through Mr. Koshilovsky, the head of the Far Eastern Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, regarding the landing of approximately one company of Japanese troops on one of the two Heilongjiang islands, arguing that it violated the understanding reached between Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu and Soviet Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov. At the time, Mr. Nishi did not make a definite statement regarding the future actions of the Japanese "Manchu" troops. (Central News Agency dispatch, 7th) Paris Correspondence

### A Record of the International Exhibition of Arts and Crafts (Part 2)

— Xiao Ke

Speaking of buildings divided by region, there are: the Lyon Pavilion, mainly displaying silk weaving industry; the Lorraine Pavilion, mainly producing beer; the Champagne Pavilion, mainly producing various champagnes; the Central Region Pavilion, the region with the most mineral water, famous for: Vichy, Chatel-Guyon, Royat, Le Mont-Dore, which attract many foreigners every year for tourism and medical treatment.

Colonial participants include: the Algiers Pavilion, the Mandate-ruled Syria and Lebanon Pavilion, the Madagascar Pavilion, the Martinique Pavilion, the French West Africa Pavilion, the French Equatorial Africa Pavilion, the French Indochina Pavilion, etc.

The significance of naming this exhibition "Arts and Crafts" is to integrate arts and crafts into modern life. Therefore, all facilities are based on this meaning as a standard. Among them, the most widely applied is electric light. Everywhere one sees the painstaking designs of engineers to attract the audience's attention. Now, I will describe them separately as follows:

(1) The Hydroelectric Stage, located in the Seine River between the Alma Bridge and the Invalides, uses an 1,800-horsepower water pump, divided into ten groups, to draw water from the bottom of the Seine River and shoot it upwards, reaching a height of 60 meters, capable of forming various patterns. Underwater, there are three sets of high-intensity electric lights: one set has 310 lamps with 3,000 watts of power, one set has 80 lamps with 1,500 watts, and another set has 4,000 lamps with 500 watts. Furthermore, 110 five-color glass turntables are placed in front of the high-intensity lights. The five-color lights and water splashes reflect each other in hundreds of styles, grand and beautiful. The construction of this project cost a total of seven million francs.

(2) The Electric Light Building is located on the Champ de Mars, opposite the Military Academy. The architectural style is extremely simple, 60 meters long, 25 meters wide, and 15 meters high. Its special feature is that there are no windows on the top, and it can also serve as the entrance to the exhibition. On the front wall, there is the world's largest painting, by Raoul Dufy, depicting the history of the development of electricity. Upon entering, there are four extremely large machines used in modern power plants. Visitors here are already in a state of transition between imagination and reality. Further in, there is a detailed explanation of the place of electric light in modern society, displaying each stage from the generation and transportation of electricity to its illumination. There is also a demonstration room for the application of electricity and four cinema rooms. What is even more novel is that this 60-meter-long windowless wall can be used as a screen for projecting movies and art films at night, which can be considered the world's largest screen.

(3) During the exhibition, the world-famous Eiffel Tower will be transformed into a giant beacon, visible from over a hundred miles away. Its electric light installation consists of 40 powerful high-intensity lights mounted on the first level of the tower, illuminating up to 5,000 meters away. There are also 10,000 light tubes installed below the level to illuminate the interior of the tower. These 40 high-intensity lights can also change colors, forming the shape of a peacock spreading its tail, or a cluster of flowers, suddenly extinguished, and then transformed into a national flag 40 meters wide and 50 meters high, illuminating the top of the tower 300 meters high. This is an unprecedented use of light in an exhibition.

(4) The applications of the Eiffel Tower in this exhibition have not yet reached their full potential. Recently, engineers and technicians are hoisting an electrical case, 15 centimeters thick, 405 meters long, and weighing 12 tons, onto the Eiffel Tower. Once installed, wireless image transmission will begin. This station has a power of 72 kilowatts and can transmit to a range of 70 kilometers, making it the most powerful wireless image transmission station in the world today.

The widespread use of electricity in this exhibition, as described above, can already give a general idea. In terms of the total number of electrical equipment in the entire venue: there are 100 kilometers of underground electrical cables and 1,000 kilometers of above-ground electrical cables, requiring a total power of 53,000 kilowatts (far exceeding that of a major French city such as Bordeaux). As for the previous colonial exhibition, the power consumption was 17,000 kilowatts.

In addition to this, there are two other scientific and technological creations in the exhibition:

The Planetarium: The structure of this hall requires 150 tons of reinforcing steel. From this hall, visitors can observe how the planets generally move. The revolutions of the planets, some in one month, some in one noon, to one century, ten centuries, can show the changes of 20,000 years in four minutes, appearing vividly before the audience, one light and one dark, as if immersed in them.

The Crystal Human Body: This scientific creation is borrowed from the Social Museum in Dresden, Germany. Visitors can see the internal structure of the body, the circulation of blood, and the opening and contraction of the organs from the crystal human body. These various movements are no different from those of a living person.

In order to avoid wasting time for foreign or domestic tourists in this exhibition venue with 280 buildings, an electric light map of the entire venue is set up at each entrance. If tourists want to go to a certain place, they only need to press on that place, and a light will illuminate on the map. If not, there are also leadership cassettes in various languages. First, find the representative number of a certain place on the table, and then, like an automatic telephone, dial this number on the machine, and a record with one-fifth of a thousandth of a copy will automatically play, indicating everything that tourists want to know.

In this mid-June, there are numerous theatrical, musical performances, cooking, sailing and other competitions. Art and craftsmanship are worthy of the name, and it is truly a grand event in modern international affairs.

### The Future of Greater Shanghai

— Ren

The 10th Anniversary Celebration of the establishment of this city opened yesterday. All the citizens were overjoyed. This joyful commemorative festival is not only significant in commemorating the achievements of the past ten years of effort. It is especially important to take advantage of this auspicious occasion to set a goal for future efforts and move forward step by step, so that Greater Shanghai can be even greater and more prosperous during the 20th Anniversary in 1937 than it is now during the 10th Anniversary. Only then will our celebration today not be in vain.

The construction of Greater Shanghai today is generally following the Greater Shanghai Plan formulated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. In addition to geographical factors, Mr. Sun naturally had various other forward-looking goals when formulating this plan. Here, we can cite its most important goal, which is that Mr. Sun wanted to use this plan to make Shanghai the Shanghai of China. The current malformed development of Shanghai is generally known to anyone. Correcting this deformity, apart from a new change in Shanghai, I am afraid it will be difficult to find a solution. In other words, if the current industrial and commercial center of Shanghai is not transformed into a centralized center, then the current various deformities will be impossible to eradicate. This, we believe, is the spirit of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Greater Shanghai Plan. Therefore, our efforts for Greater Shanghai should focus on this point.

The achievements of Shanghai's construction in the past ten years are now presented before our eyes. From this point of view, we cannot but thank the efforts of the municipal authorities over the past ten years. However, the current central area of Greater Shanghai is more of a political and cultural center of Shanghai than an economic center of Shanghai. This is precisely because the focus of Greater Shanghai's construction over the past ten years seems to have been too heavily weighted towards the political and cultural aspects, while the industrial and commercial economic aspects seem to have been relatively neglected.

The main industrial and commercial facilities of Greater Shanghai now, apart from the completion of the first phase of the Qiujiang Wharf, have no other relatively important constructions. Even in terms of transportation and road administration, it has not yet reached the degree of "convenience." With this, it is fundamentally difficult to hope that Greater Shanghai can become a new industrial and commercial center. Therefore, we believe that Greater Shanghai in the future should make special efforts in this area, complete the construction of various industrial and commercial facilities, improve the city's transportation and road administration, encourage people to invest in Greater Shanghai, and provide superior guarantees, so that Greater Shanghai can become the Greater Shanghai in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's mind.

Speaking of construction, we naturally cannot fail to mention the issue of construction funds. Everyone knows that Shanghai's finances are in deficit. For almost five or six years out of ten, expenditures have exceeded revenues. For example, the budget for the 26th year [of the Republic, 1937] is short by as much as 3 million yuan. It is naturally difficult to carry out construction with such financial strength. However, after careful study, we feel that the percentage of political fundraising expenses in the municipal finances seems to be too large. If some methods can be found here, it can somewhat help with construction funding. Even if it is still not enough, borrowing can also be considered. As long as these public bonds are truly used for productive construction.

In summary, we have infinitely great hopes for the future of Greater Shanghai. As long as we work hard on industrial and commercial construction, the construction funds will not be a problem, and the construction manpower will naturally be even less of a problem. With this, after another ten years of effort, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Greater Shanghai will surely be realized in fact.

### Kong Xiangxi Delivers Radio Address in the US, Welcoming Cooperation Under the Principle of Equality

Also broadly discusses the progress of the construction of the New China. Kong dines at the White House at Roosevelt's invitation yesterday.

[Washington] US President Roosevelt invited Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi to lunch at the White House on Wednesday. Kong will also meet with Secretary of State Hull. According to Hull, he is willing to have general economic talks with Kong, without involving specific plans. The Chinese Embassy in the United States stated that Kong will stay in Washington for several days. (Guomin Telegram, 6th)

[New York] Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice Premier and Minister of Finance of our country, delivered a radio address here tonight, broadcast by the National Broadcasting Company of America. The speech time was from 7:15 PM to 7:30 PM. In his speech, Kong broadly discussed the construction programs currently underway in our country, and told American radio listeners that China deeply welcomes assistance based on the principle of equality. Kong's voice was very clear, and millions of Americans listened to the speech quietly by the radio. A brief translation of the full text of Kong's speech is as follows: For decades, I (Kong referred to himself, the following is imitated) came to the United States to study and learn. This time, I came as a "friendly envoy," with the mission of studying the economic situation of your country, and I feel very happy. I previously studied at Oberlin College and Yale University, and I brought the insights I gained from studying back to my motherland. This time, I will also bring back the pleasant memories of my friendship with the United States to tell my compatriots. However, the China of my student days in the United States is very different from the China of today. At that time, China was mired in political turmoil. Today's China is embarking on the path of national construction. The past thirty years of struggle are the price China paid for entering a new stage. China's struggles may have caused a bad impression on Western countries. However, in fact, the hardships and tribulations China has experienced are a symbol of progress. Various crises may feel severe at a particular time, but like the occurrence of storms, they only affect the surface of the ocean, and their latent power is undamaged and intact. China relies on this power to achieve its final goal, uniting 470 million people. So what is this power? The democratic politics contained in the Three Principles of the People of China's late Premier Sun Yat-sen is one of them. China has been ruled by emperors for countless centuries, but the idea of democratic politics has long been deeply rooted and deeply ingrained in the people. Confucius's saying "The people are the most important, the state is second, and the ruler is the least important" is clear evidence of this. Premier Sun's interpretation of the Three Principles of the People accurately reflects the Chinese people's views on democratic politics and is similar to the principle of "government of the people, by the people, for the people." In addition, there is another force that promotes the unity of the Chinese people. What is this force? The spirit of self-preservation, self-defense, and self-help. Just as in biology, the law of self-preservation occupies a superior position, the Chinese people generally feel that they must rely on their own strength and resources to survive and determine their future destiny. The talent of the Chinese people is the element of China's construction. The recent history of China has mostly been created by the inherent vitality of the people, the ability to adapt to the environment, and the confidence in a great future. This virtue has been deeply ingrained in the people, no matter where, from Guangzhou to Manchuria, Shanghai to the South Seas Islands, this is the case. In the past few centuries, countless lives and money have been lost due to natural disasters and foreign insults, but China's national strength has not been damaged at all, but has increased day by day. I believe you all know that China is now a unified country. China's currency reform has been completed, and the people are full of the spirit of a new nation. Furthermore, in the process of building a new country, the people of the enemy country have fully demonstrated their wisdom, accepting new ideas while still preserving the essence of their inherent culture. For example, although we have adopted Western scientific methods to improve transportation and develop modern industry, we are also striving to preserve and restore traditional virtues. The New Life Movement under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and his wife is sufficient to prove this fact. What's more, in the construction of a new China, our government and people welcome the financial assistance of other countries under the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and non-infringement of national sovereignty. If peace is possible and does not conflict with our country's unification, we will definitely maintain peaceful relations with our neighbors, regardless of how close they are. The friendly relationship between China and the United States is traditional, needless to say. Our two countries have many things in common and many areas where we should help each other. Both countries have republican governments, and the people both love peace and advocate justice. In the commercial field, you can help us with machinery to develop our country's natural resources, and we can provide you with tea for your leisure enjoyment. You provide us with kerosene for fuel, and we provide you with silk for clothing. Even in our national flags, there are similarities, not only in color, but also in the meaning of the stars on your country's flag and the white sun on our country's flag, one "shining at midnight, one illuminating the blue sky." With this pleasant mood in mind, how can we not do our best to strengthen the traditional friendship between the two countries? Are we not the guarantors of peace in the Pacific? At the beginning of the last century, your Secretary of State Hay crystallized the relationship between China and the United States in the so-called "Open Door" policy. China is now ready to expand it and make it a policy of "openness and welcoming hands," so that the Pacific can live up to its name. (Central News Agency dispatch, 7th)

[New York] The China Institute in America, the Pan-American Society, the China-America Trade Council, and other organizations jointly hosted a banquet last night (6th) to entertain Vice Premier Kong. More than 200 Chinese and American dignitaries were invited to accompany him. Dr. Potter, President of the China Institute, chaired the banquet. Forbes, Honorary President of the China Institute, Thomas, President of the China-America Trade Council, and Pierson, President of the US Export-Import Bank, all delivered speeches successively, praising Kong's political achievements. Kong also gave a reply, describing the recent progress of China in detail. Kong said that China's achievements should be attributed to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's proper leadership, and the Nationalist Party's promotion of people's awareness of the necessity of national unity and unification was also powerful. People now generally know that they must work hard to create a new China. This public opinion can be seen in public slogans such as "Resolve to work, work hard, and work practically." The New Life Movement initiated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and his wife has now spread throughout the country. Its purpose is to awaken the people and prevent them from indulging in intellectual confusion and spiritual laziness. What we need most in the work of national revival is a new life, in other words, a life of faith, enthusiasm, and activity. Minister Kong also spoke about the unification of Chinese finances, the reform of currency, the stability of credit, and the progress of transportation, and presented comparative figures of highways, telecommunications, and railways to show the progress of Chinese transportation, which greatly moved the listeners. Minister Kong also spoke about the possibility of Sino-American cooperation, saying that China needs transportation facilities more than anything else, because the country's natural resources will be developed with the progress of these facilities. We need your mining machinery, agricultural tools, electrical appliances, and all kinds of ordinary industrial equipment. We will develop and reorganize financial enterprises on a large scale. You have money, capital, materials, and expertise to help us greatly and share our interests. The living standards of our 470 million people have been slightly improved. This phenomenon has proved that commerce and general economy are of great benefit to the United States. If the United States invests its surplus capital in China, we will express our welcome and guarantee that our government will provide protection. Vice Premier Kong concluded that China is a friend of the United States. We should cooperate with each other for the sake of peace and interests in the Pacific. (Central News Agency dispatch, 7th)

[New York] The authorities of Chase Bank hosted a banquet for Chinese Finance Minister Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting, and Director of the Chinese Foreign Trade Bureau Guo Bingwen this afternoon. Chairman Aldrich and General Manager Campbell of Chase Bank were present. The China Institute, the Asia Society, and the China-America Trade Council jointly hosted a banquet for the Zhasi tonight. Kong spoke about China's political and financial achievements and the opportunities for American investors, and said that we now want to develop China's human and natural resources, not only for the happiness of the Chinese people, but also to share the benefits with all friendly countries to China. China is on the eve of a five-year economic construction, which is the world's largest market for production tools. American people should be particularly interested. If you are willing to invest your surplus capital in China, I express my great welcome, and the Chinese government is willing to take full responsibility for protection. Sino-American relations have always been friendly. Former US Secretary of State John Hay created the Open Door policy, and the United States was the first to return the Boxer Indemnity. Kong then described the political progress of China in recent years, saying that China, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, has reached a state of national unification and political stability, which is unprecedented in modern history. The peaceful resolution of the Guangdong-Guangxi problem and the Xi'an Incident is sufficient evidence of the unifying force, and it is no longer the disunity and undisciplined state of the warlord era. This change is due to the progress of the national mentality, and the New Life Movement initiated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's wife is also the Chinese Renaissance. (Guomin Telegram, 6th)

### World Cultural Cooperation Association

Li Shizeng to Present Report

[Paris] Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, is currently attending the Second Congress of National Branches of the World Cultural Cooperation Association here. He plans to submit a report to the Congress tomorrow or the day after, entitled "The Task Undertaken by National Branches in Making the People of Their Respective Countries Understand the Various Activities of the International Cultural Cooperation Organization." Li Shizeng also gave an interview to a Havas News Agency reporter, saying briefly that I arrived in Paris on June 29th and am now attending four meetings, which will last for about a month, until July 29th. This month is also the so-called Cultural Cooperation Month. During this month, there are no less than hundreds of international conferences held in Paris, with many people from various countries participating. As for the ones I personally attended, there are only four meetings: one is the lecture series at the Higher International Research Institute of the University of Paris, one is the Congress of National Branches of the World Cultural Cooperation Association, one is the meeting of the World Cultural Cooperation Committee, and one is the International Popular Education Conference. Since I came to Paris, I have been immersed in the atmosphere of international cultural cooperation from morning till night, which is both pleasant and gratifying. As for the report I will submit to the Congress of National Branches of the World Cultural Cooperation Association, I will explain the work and tasks of the World Cultural Cooperation Organization from the standpoint of the Chinese branch. The World Cultural Cooperation Association was established under the auspices of the League of Nations for only a few years. Its career is only in its infancy, and its achievements are already considerable. However, there is still much work to be done in the future. Therefore, the scope of world cultural cooperation must be expanded to make the international solidarity and unity more concrete, in order to carry out the goal of world peace. Its task is very important. In short, cultural cooperation was originally one of the goals of the League of Nations. Chinese Confucian scholars have a saying about caring for both people and things, and they also say that all within the four seas are brothers. If this ideal cannot become a reality one day, then cultural cooperation will not be able to fulfill its mission one day. I firmly believe that although there are many difficulties ahead, there will eventually be a day when it is carried out, but this belongs to the scope of politics. Li Shizeng then praised the achievements of the French Sinology community, saying that France has the largest number of institutions studying Sinology. In China, great attention is also paid to Western culture. Chinese schools, from middle school to university, all make Western languages and culture compulsory subjects.

### Where to Search for the Missing Female Aviator in the Vast Pacific Ocean

The US Government Has Already Spent $450,000; Further Searches Cost $250,000 Daily

[New York] Regarding the hope for the safety of Ms. Earhart and her navigator, through the results of the search, it has gradually turned from an uncertain indication to a dim one. This afternoon, a report from Galveston stated that the Coast Guard cutter Itasca had sighted Ms. Earhart's plane, but this was just hearsay. Today, President Roosevelt, when meeting with reporters, expressed his deep concern for Ms. Earhart's safety. He stated that the Navy and other government authorities are doing their best to find the female aviator and her navigator, Noonan, and the search area is not limited by distance. He further stated that he receives reports on the progress of the search work at all times. The government has spent $450,000 US dollars on this matter, and the cost of continuing the search is $250,000 per day. (Central News Agency, 6th, Reuters)

[San Francisco] The US Customs Headquarters here announced today that the Holland Island radio station had received a new signal, possibly sent by Ms. Earhart, and its direction had been measured. If not southeast by south of the station, then northwest by north, which is the same as the position where Ms. Earhart last sent a message before disappearing. (6th, National Telegram)

### Palestine to Be Divided into Three Major Areas

Report of the British Royal Commission Published; Deep National Division Leads to Termination of Mandate

[London] The report of the Palestine Royal Commission advocates dividing Palestine into three major areas: Jewish, Arab, and British Mandate zones. This proposal has been approved by the British government. The full text of the report was published today, containing two main conclusions of the Royal Commission:

㊀ The cultures of the Jewish and Arab nations cannot be mixed or assimilated. ㊁ The division between the two nations is now very deep, and if the current mandate system continues, this division will only deepen. The commission proposes ending the current mandate system and starting negotiations with the Arab and Transjordanian governments and the Zionist Organization to divide Palestine into ㊀ an Arab area to be incorporated into Transjordan, ㊁ a Jewish area, and ㊂ a British Mandate area extending from a point north of Jerusalem to a point south of Bethlehem, with the addition of a corridor from Jerusalem to Jaffa providing access to the sea. The mandated country should also be entrusted with the management of Nazareth and have the right to protect the sanctity of the river and the west bank of the Sea of Galilee, and to protect the assets considered sacred by Western nations in the Arab and Jewish areas.

Borders of the Arab and Jewish Areas

The borders of the Arab and Jewish areas are as follows:

The boundary line starts at Ras Nakura, follows Palestine's existing northeast border to the Sea of Galilee, crosses the lake to the Jordan River basin, and then follows the river to a point north of Beisan, crosses the Beisan Plain, follows the southern edge of the Jezreel Valley to a point near Megiddo, then goes south along the edge of the coastal plain, turning west to avoid Tulkarm and reach the Jaffa corridor near Lydda, then south of this corridor, along the edge of the plain, to a point ten miles south of Rehovot, from there westward to the sea. Haifa, Tiberias, Safed, and Acre should be placed under mandate administration for a certain period. The Arab area can obtain access to the sea at Jaffa. The Jewish area should subsidize the Arab area, the amount to be determined later. The British government, in view of the backwardness of Transjordan, should provide the Arab area with a subsidy of £2 million in British gold.

The report of the commission contains provisions for the sale of property and exchange of residents after the division of Palestine, and advocates the adoption of temporary measures to manage immigration and land sales when the treaty is established.

Granting Opportunity for Independence

Although the Royal Commission admitted that it could not accept all the demands of the Arabs and Jews, it said that the proposed articles can enable the Arabs to obtain national independence and enjoy the possibility of cooperating with neighboring Arabs in the entire unity and progress of the Arab world on an equal footing, and can eliminate the Arabs' concern that their holy places are occupied by the Jews. In addition, the Arabs can also obtain Jewish assistance and a huge sum of £2 million from Britain. As for the Jews, they can achieve their goal of restoring the country and no longer live as a minority.

British Government Expresses Approval

In its memorandum, the British government stated that, in view of its obligations under the Covenant of the League of Nations and other international treaties, it intends to take the necessary steps to obtain the freedom to implement the partition plan. The British government hopes that all relevant nations will agree to this plan. Although the British government has encountered discouraging experiences, it still strives to encourage cooperation between Arabs and Jews, and deeply hopes that these two nations will each adjust their national aspirations and form an entire nation under a unified government. However, today, the British government has to conclude that the desires of both parties are mutually contradictory and cannot be reconciled, and that the current mandate system cannot satisfy them. Therefore, the government approves the articles of the Royal Commission, considering them to be the best and most hopeful way to resolve the stalemate. This approach, in addition to allowing both nations to benefit as mentioned in the report, can also replace the existing suspicion with the concept of trust and security, and both nations can thus share peace and prosperity. However, the British government does not intend to abandon its responsibility to maintain peace, order, and good administration until this plan is realized. (Central News Agency, 7th, Reuters)

Warship Opens the Sea

⊙Haifa The report of the Palestine Committee is scheduled to be published tomorrow. The 32,000-ton British battlecruiser "Repulse" arrived here today from Jaffa to prevent incidents caused by dissatisfaction among Arabs and Jews after the report is released. (Central News Agency, 7th, Reuters)

### Germany Compels Austrian Authorities to Allow the Nazi Party to Join the Cabinet

Hitler Presents a Formal Note; Will Use Violence If Not Obeyed

[Paris] Political figures here deeply fear that Germany may force Austria to allow the Nazi Party to participate in the cabinet in the near future. According to a reporter for the Agence Economique et Financiere, the German leader Hitler has instructed the German ambassador to Austria, von Papen, to present a note to the Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg, which is almost equivalent to an ultimatum. It states that the Austrian government should allow four members of the Nazi Party to join the Austrian cabinet, and should also recognize the belligerent rights of the Styrian Home Guard government. If these two matters are not complied with, Germany will allow Austrian Nazi Party members to "freely express their wishes," in other words, to take the violent methods used by the Austrian Nazi Party in the past to implement the above two political programs. (Central News Agency, 7th, Havas)

### German-Austrian Agreement

Joint Committee of the Two Countries to Study Implementation Methods

[Vienna] The German-Austrian Joint Committee, with the purpose of studying the implementation methods of the German-Austrian Agreement of July 11th last year, met today, specializing in studying the problem of newspaper propaganda between the two countries. It is heard that the German side has requested permission for most German newspapers to enter Austria, but the Austrian government, due to German newspapers fabricating news claiming that Austria is mistreating Nazi Party prisoners in detention camps, has raised the matter with Germany. This issue should be resolved by Germany to Austria's satisfaction. (Central News Agency, 7th, Havas)

### Anglo-German and Anglo-Russian Naval Agreements

Experts Draft the Texts; Agreements May Be Signed This Week

[London] According to reliable sources, the naval agreements between Britain and Germany and between Britain and Russia (i.e., agreements that stipulate qualitative limitations on naval forces based on the Anglo-French-American London Naval Treaty) will be signed this week, or possibly before the 9th of this month. All kinds of difficulties no longer exist at this time. Naval experts from the three countries are now busy drafting the texts. Germany had previously requested to build five 10,000-ton cruisers, but the Soviet Union requested Germany to reduce the number by two, and would accept only the construction of seven 8,000-ton cruisers, but this was rejected by Germany. The main reason for the delay in negotiations was precisely this. Later, Britain argued that 10,000-ton cruisers were originally prohibited by the Anglo-French-American naval treaty and would inevitably be eliminated sooner or later. Therefore, it advocated that the number of 10,000-ton cruisers should no longer be mentioned in the Anglo-German and Anglo-Russian naval agreements, which was accepted by Germany and Russia, and the negotiations proceeded smoothly. (Central News Agency, 6th, Havas)

[Berlin] Germany is now actively expanding its navy. According to a prediction by the Vossische Zeitung today, the German fleet will reach 400,000 tons by 1943, including eight battleships, fourteen cruisers, two aircraft carriers, forty destroyers and torpedo boats, and 23,000 tons of submarines.

### The Stalemate of Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War Still Has Room for Maneuvering

Compromise Solutions Under Secret Negotiation; Adjustment Committee to Hold Plenary Meeting Tomorrow

[London] Public opinion here believes that if Germany is unwilling to join Italy in declaring war on Britain, Italy's strength alone will hardly be able to cope. Britain's rearmament plan has progressed far and its resources are abundant, far beyond what Italy can resist. Although the German leader Hitler and his foreign minister are helping Italy against Britain, they are secretly preparing to advance in Central Europe, such as nationalizing Austria's Nazi party. According to news from Rome today, Mussolini seems to have some room for maneuvering in the deadlock of the non-intervention agreement. The maneuvering method may be to completely abandon the plan to monitor the west coast, while retaining the plan to monitor ports and borders. At the same time, Italy and Germany must also allow the maintenance of the status quo in the Mediterranean. (6th, National Telegram)

[Rome] Rome now apparently holds a more hopeful view of the overall European situation, feeling that various parties are now secretly negotiating to find a solution to the Spanish problem that can satisfy all parties. Newspapers are no longer attacking the British government. There is a widespread advocacy that all countries should allow both sides fighting in Spain to enjoy some belligerent rights, a proposal first initiated by the United States. (Central News Agency, 6th, Reuters)

[Rome] The Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee is scheduled to hold a plenary meeting on the 9th of this month. People here generally believe that Italy will try to preserve as much as possible the counter-proposal put forward by Italy and Germany at the meeting (i.e., ㊀ abolish the maritime surveillance plan, ㊁ the land surveillance plan can still be maintained, and ㊂ recognize both sides of the Spanish civil war as belligerents). Currently, Hungary and Portugal have agreed to speak out in support of Germany and Italy and are now negotiating with Romania to support the counter-proposal of Germany and Italy. Generally, when this counter-proposal is put to a vote, the number of affirmative votes may not exceed five, but it is enough to prevent the passage of the British and French surveillance plans, and to force the Adjustment Committee to seek a compromise solution and include the views of Germany and Italy in it. (Central News Agency, 6th, Havas)

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden met separately with French Ambassador Corbin, Portuguese Minister Monteiro, Italian Ambassador Grandi, and Greek Minister Simopoulos this afternoon to discuss matters. British parliamentarians believe that the British government's goal is to promptly discuss the issue of the withdrawal of foreign volunteers from Spain. This is what Foreign Secretary Eden discussed with the ambassadors of various countries today. It is likely that Portugal will express its approval of the withdrawal of volunteers or may be able to mediate between the British government and the Spanish Nationalist government to make the Nationalist government accept this approach. (Central News Agency, 6th, Havas)

[London] Responsible officials recently declared that the Spanish Republican government has explicitly opposed the abolition of the naval surveillance method in Spain and its replacement with a port surveillance plan, and does not allow surveillance personnel to exercise their powers within the territory of the Republican government. In addition, regarding the recognition of both sides of the Spanish civil war as belligerents, Foreign Secretary Eden and French Ambassador to Britain Corbin have abandoned this proposal after discussions this morning, and are unwilling to use this as an exchange condition for assigning the naval surveillance work in Spain to the British and French navies. In summary, if the international situation regarding the Spanish civil war is to be thoroughly changed, the only concrete factor is to reach an agreement on the issue of withdrawing volunteers from various countries. Regarding this, the Spanish Republican government has agreed to comply and is now only waiting for the Nationalist government to express its attitude. However, if the method of withdrawing volunteers cannot be established before the 9th of this month (i.e., the date of the plenary meeting of the Adjustment Committee), the Adjustment Committee will require representatives of various countries to express their views on the surveillance plan proposed by Britain and France, and the counter-proposal of Germany and Italy. In addition, Poland may suggest that a special small committee be organized by various neutral countries to conduct a comprehensive study of the Spanish issue in order to find a compromise solution. People generally believe that the Adjustment Committee is afraid of entrusting this responsibility to the neutral countries, but it is expected that a small committee will eventually be organized to seek a compromise solution.

### Leader of Spanish Rebels Sends a Note to the Powers

Asks to Be Recognized as Belligerent; Threatens Economic Blockade

⊙Salamanca General Franco, leader of the Nationalist government, recently sent a note to various countries and broadcast it to various locations by the Nationalist radio station tonight, requesting that various countries recognize the Nationalist army as a belligerent in accordance with international law. The note stated, "If various countries refuse this request, when we determine international economic policy in the future, we will treat those countries that express animosity towards us with a closed-door policy. Do not be surprised at that time." (Central News Agency, 6th, Havas)

### German-Spanish Rebel Trade Negotiations Completed

Agreement to Be Signed Soon

[Paris] It is claimed here that the commercial negotiations that began in Berlin this March between the Spanish Franco government and the German government are now nearing completion and are expected to be signed this weekend. The content will be a clearing agreement between Germany and the Spanish Nationalist army and an agreement on the exchange of goods between the two countries. (7th, National Haitong Telegram)

### Results of the General Election in the Irish Free State

Sinn Féin Occupies Half the Seats in Parliament; Likely to Woo the Labour Party for Cooperation

⊙Dublin The final results of the general election in the Irish Free State show that de Valera's Sinn Féin has won 69 seats in the new parliament, and the total number of seats held by other parties is also 69. However, among Sinn Féin's 69 seats, there is one seat for the speaker, so the result is that Sinn Féin has one seat less compared with the other parties. If de Valera wants to control the government, he still needs to reach an understanding with the Labour Party. Furthermore, the Labour Party, which only occupied eight seats in the previous parliament, has actually increased to twelve seats this time. If the alliance between de Valera and the Labour Party is established, then de Valera's political power cannot be underestimated. The only concern is that if de Valera wants to unite with the Labour Party, his original policies, such as the draft constitution, must be greatly revised. People believe that no matter what steps are taken in the future, there will probably be a general election again within a few months. (Central News Agency, 6th, Reuters)

### Kawagoe's Mission in North China

Will Reside in Tianjin for Two Months to Focus on Economic Development Issues; Loan Guarantee for the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway Under Study

Tianjin Correspondence. Japanese Ambassador to China Kawagoe is scheduled to arrive in Tianjin on the 8th of this month. According to Japanese sources here, after Kawagoe arrives in Tianjin, he will decide whether to convene a meeting of all Japanese consuls in China or a meeting of Japanese consuls in North China, depending on the circumstances. If a meeting of all Japanese consuls is convened, the issue that will be focused on for discussion will be the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations. If a meeting of Japanese consuls in North China is convened, the issue that will be focused on for discussion will be general diplomatic issues targeting the North China authorities. However, even if the two meetings are not convened because they are not necessary, all Japanese consuls in North China must arrive in Tianjin before the 15th to meet with Kawagoe and report on the internal and external situation of their local missions. Before Kawagoe arrives in Tianjin, he will first inspect Qingdao and pay close attention to our tax police special service regiment stationed there, because the Japanese side still considers this incident to be the most important of all the current diplomatic issues in North China. After Kawagoe arrives in Tianjin, in addition to planning to meet with Song Zheyuan in Beiping around the 20th, he will stay in Tianjin for two months and will not go south to Guling to meet with Chiang and Wang until early September at the earliest. During his residence in North China, he will negotiate various aspects related to the economic development of North China with the Hebei-Chahar authorities as counterparts, based on the new Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' China policy. Among them, although the Longyan Iron Mine, Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway, and holiday loans have been negotiated in succession by the Tianjin Japanese Army Headquarters and the Japanese Xingzhong Company, from the perspective of normal diplomatic procedures, the signing of loan agreements must still be handled by someone with the status and position of Kawagoe, representing the Japanese side and dealing with the Hebei-Chahar authorities, in order to be seamless and avoid the suspicion of the Japanese Army Headquarters' military aggression. In addition, there are still many opportunities that the Japanese side considers to be reformed in politics, and it is not easy to carry out smoothly without diplomatic power. Therefore, Kawagoe's long-term stay in Tianjin is precisely to start from this point. In other words, he will talk when there is an opportunity to talk, otherwise he is unwilling to take the initiative to propose and express any urging to our side.

The construction of the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway, because of Kawagoe's return to office and his efforts to develop the North China economy, has turned from being silent to being blazing hot. Recently, Hirayama Takashi, director of the Japanese Xingzhong Company's Tianjin office, and Chen Juesheng, director of the Beining Railway Bureau, have been constantly negotiating. The general idea is that the method of constructing the railway with loans is the easiest to realize. The loan amount is 24 million yuan, with the Japanese East Asia Development Company assisting Xingzhong, and Xingzhong acting as the creditor of the loan funds. The Hebei-Chahar side plans to use the additional donation for the Haihe River management project as a guarantee, to be repaid in installments over the years. However, this matter is related to the Tianjin Customs and the North China Water Conservancy Commission. Even if the North China Water Conservancy Commission agrees, it is necessary to obtain the approval of the Ministry of Finance as to whether the Tianjin Customs has the right to contribute to it. It is difficult to say whether this matter will eventually be realized in this way. However, as far as we know, the Japanese side is extremely eager for this matter to be completed, and some authorities in Hebei-Chahar are indeed heated up for this matter. (5th)

### The Yunnan Provincial Tusi Deny Gao Yuzhu Is Their Representative

They Have Already Telegraphed a Statement to the Central Government, Declaring No Responsibility for Gao's Actions.

Yunnan News Agency Report: Li Zongbo, representative of the Lijiang Muli Tusi in Yunnan Province, and others, upon reading reports that Ms. Gao Yuzhu in Beijing was claiming to be the General Representative of the Southwest Yi Ethnic Groups and was petitioning various government agencies, expressed astonishment. They stated that the Yi people of Yunnan Province had never elected Gao as their representative to petition the central government agencies. Yesterday, they telegraphed the central government to deny that Gao Yuzhu was their General Representative, and that the Tusi of this province would not be responsible for any of her actions. The original telegram is as follows: "To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, Chairman of the National Government Lin, and Premier of the Executive Yuan Jiang: We have read reports in the newspapers of Beijing and Shanghai, as well as in the daily newspapers of this province, that Ms. Gao Yuzhu is claiming to be the General Representative of the Southwest Yi Ethnic Groups and is petitioning various government agencies and contacting various organizations, running around everywhere. We are extremely shocked by this. While Gao Yuzhu is indeed a member of one of the ethnic groups of Yunnan, her actions in Beijing and Shanghai are purely her own and there is no factual basis for any organization having elected her as a representative. If it is necessary to elect a representative, it should first be reported to and approved by the provincial government and the Party Headquarters for filing before it is effective. We therefore send this telegram to declare that Yunnan's Tusi and people will not be responsible for any actions of Gao Yuzhu from now on. We respectfully request your attention. Li Zongbo, Representative of the Lijiang Muli Tusi in Yunnan; Fang Keguang, Pacification Commissioner of Mangshi; Duo Yingpei, Tusi of Zhefang; Dao Sihongsheng, Tusi of Zhanting; Gong Shou, Tusi of Nanxun; Duo Yongqing, Tusi of Longchuan; Ji Fu, Tusi of Deqin; He Rongguang, Qianzong of Deqin; Liu En, Qianzong of Zhongdian, et al. kowtow."

### Mountain Torrents Erupt in Northern Anhui

The Huai River and Tributaries Overflow, Autumn Crops Are Submerged.

Bengbu Correspondence: Since last month, the weather in Northern Anhui has been uncertain with alternating rain and sunshine, and the rivers have risen and fallen from time to time. Unexpectedly, in the most recent week, there has been continuous, drizzling rain with little interruption. Grains such as sorghum, soybeans, and millet have been affected by the cold rain, and their development has been greatly impacted. This impact on common crops is already significant. However, since the beginning of the month, there have been consecutive days of heavy rain in the upper reaches of the Huai River, and mountain torrents have erupted in various places. Small streams and large rivers have all risen sharply, especially the Wo and Huai rivers. The Ying, Yuan, Ci, and Sui rivers are secondary. Among them, the Wo River between Guo Yang and Huaiyuan has recently been subjected to heavy rain and mountain floods. The water level has continued to rise, overflowing the banks and causing turbulent floods. The water depth on the plains is several feet, and the rice fields are a vast expanse of water, almost like a swamp. According to people from Huaiyuan, the Wo River has lost its river form, and the point where the Huai and Wo rivers meet is especially turbulent. In addition, aquatic plants are rampant, and the people's boats in Huaiyuan can no longer sail upstream along the Wo River. The water level of the Huai River in the Bengbu section has suddenly risen by more than ten feet. If the drizzling rain does not stop, the flood season is worrying. The Fengyang County Government specially convened a flood prevention meeting on the 5th to discuss flood prevention measures such as protecting embankments, rescuing dangers, repairing dams, and preparing materials, and decided to establish a flood prevention committee to jointly intensify flood prevention work with the counties along the Huai River.

More than 20 creditors, including Xiang Yinji, expressed opposition to the bank's liquidation.

It is said that the biggest reason for the bank's closure is nothing more than excessive pledged real estate and miscellaneous grains, which made it difficult for funds to circulate.

The Jiangdu County Government believes that the city river outside the West Gate is mostly turbid and cannot be used as drinking water. Special attention should be paid to this during the summer.

The Police Bureau was ordered to instruct the police guarding the city gate at the West Gate to strictly prohibit the passage of water carts and water carriers entering and exiting.

The man's reply was evasive, and he lured the detective to nearby Renshou Lane, pulled out a Browning pistol, and fired two shots at Li Yun. Li was shot in the left shoulder, and the bullet went out from his back. He chased after the criminal while injured. At that time, police whistles sounded everywhere, and the police from the Guangfumen First Police Station of the First Police Station and the patrol police along the roads of the Fourth Police Station gathered after hearing the alarm and chased after him with live ammunition.

President Chiang's Admonishment on Two Major Matters

Mayor Yu read President Chiang's congratulatory address, which stated, "Since the reorganization of Shanghai as a municipality, ten years have passed in an instant. A celebration is held this year on July 7th to commemorate the past and encourage the future. The intention is very good. Shanghai is a vital hub for China's rivers and seas, a transportation center, and the most important market for international trade. The government affairs are complex. Fortunately, the local officials and people have been able to recognize the urgency of the national crisis, work together diligently, and make basic constructions in various aspects of municipal administration. Looking back at the situation ten years ago, there are reasons for comfort. At this time of national peril and economic decline, in order to reverse the country's misfortune and the national crisis, all measures must be carefully planned and implemented with urgent effort. Therefore, the New Life Movement must advance simultaneously and complementarily with the National Economic Reconstruction Movement in order to truly save the nation. Enhancing the morality of the people and promoting the spirit of the nation to improve their spiritual lives will complete the nation's spiritual construction. Developing the people's ability to labor and create, and increasing the people's living resources to improve their economic lives will solidify the nation's material construction. Neither aspect should be neglected, and they should complement each other to place the nation and its people on an invincible footing. Shanghai, as a city of national importance, should vigorously promote and complete the above two matters as soon as possible. Therefore, I take this anniversary celebration as an opportunity to offer these everyday words and what I believe to be the most urgent matters for saving the nation as guidance."

Acting Mayor Yu's Opening Speech

Following proper decorum, Acting Mayor Yu delivered an opening speech, stating, "July 7th, 1937, marks the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai City Government. Colleagues of the City Government are holding a commemoration. At the same time, to instill air defense knowledge, encourage industrial technology, pay attention to cultural construction, and promote municipal facilities, there will also be seven exhibitions: the Air Defense Exhibition, the Machine-Made Industry Exhibition, the Handicraft Exhibition, the Industrial Safety Exhibition, the Literature Exhibition, the Municipal Administration Exhibition, and the Hygiene Exhibition. Considering the importance of forging citizens' physiques, various sports competitions are also being held. At the beginning of this opening, we are honored to have the leaders of the central government, former mayors, leaders from all sectors, and Chinese and foreign guests come from afar to participate and provide guidance. We are deeply grateful. Regarding the meaning of the commemoration, 'commemoration' means remembering the past and believing it is sufficient; 'thinking' means thinking that the present is insufficient to seek future satisfaction. Combining them, 'commemoration' means frankly showing the past work on the one hand, hoping for fair criticism from society, and sincerely studying future progress on the other hand, seeking greater happiness for the people. Understanding this, all commemorations must have something to remember from the past and something to plan for the future in order to be meaningful. The City Government adheres to this principle. Therefore, on the 10th anniversary, we are doing our best to arouse the attention of citizens, attract citizens to gather, intensify their interest in municipal administration, enlighten their knowledge of municipal administration, promote their self-awareness, and increase their vitality in order to achieve the future development of municipal administration and the gradual implementation of autonomy, so as to fulfill the purpose of building the nation based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and implement President Chiang's great plan for national economic construction. This is the significance of the City Government's holding of the anniversary celebration, and we wish to respectfully inform the public." He then described the work over the past ten years, stating that the Shanghai City Government was established on July 7th, 1927, initially named the Shanghai Special Municipality and directly under the National Government. The first mayor, Mr. Huang Yingbai, took office and, from the beginning, believed that the city was of utmost importance to both Chinese and foreigners. The City Government's organization was still in its infancy, and there were no precedents for any regulations. Moreover, the jurisdiction was undivided, and the powers were easily confused. Therefore, he appointed a secretary-general and directors of various bureaus to take over the agencies of the Shanghai North Industrial and Patrol Donation Bureau, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Shanghai County Land Survey Bureau, and the Songhu Hygiene Bureau, and established a secretariat and nine bureaus, including finance, public security, public works, hygiene, public utilities, education, agriculture, industry, commerce, and public welfare, to handle municipal administration. He also drafted various regulations, announced and implemented them for compliance, and delineated the area of the city, submitted it to the National Government, and instructed the Jiangsu Provincial Government to send personnel to jointly survey it in order to clarify the jurisdiction and powers. The initial stages were laborious, and he exhausted all his efforts, preparing the overall structure. Regarding the appointment of staff, he strictly adopted the principle of meritocracy, so people said that his work was appropriate, and he employed appropriate people. At this time, the plan for Great Shanghai had already begun. Unfortunately, after two months in office, he requested resignation due to a recurrence of an old illness. The second mayor was Mr. Zhang Boxuan. At the beginning of his tenure, in order to conserve expenses, he abolished the Public Trustee Bureau, and all the affairs under the jurisdiction of the bureau were assigned to the relevant bureaus according to their nature. Subsequently, he began to delineate the powers of the province and the city, determine the boundaries of the city, and take over the cities and townships of the Upper and Lower Real Counties, uniformly renaming them districts. Although several cities and townships were not completely included compared to the original area, the scope had expanded several times compared to the area at the time of establishment. On July 3rd, 1928, the National Government promulgated the Special Municipality Organization Law, and the Shanghai City Government immediately reorganized in accordance with it from August 1st of the same year, changing the Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce Bureau to the Social Affairs Bureau and establishing the Port Affairs Bureau on December 25th to handle matters related to the city's river ports, coastlines, wharves, and ships. At this time, business increased sharply, and various construction efforts made gradual and considerable progress. When Mayor Zhang resigned in March 1929, Mr. Zhang Yuejun succeeded him on April 1st of the same year. After taking office, he believed that the construction of the city was just beginning, and various aspects needed to be planned comprehensively, distinguishing between urgency and priority, adapting to the times, and advancing in an orderly manner. Therefore, in addition to reorganizing and transforming the existing construction of the old city, he also delineated the city center area and strived to realize the Great Shanghai plan. On July 1st, 1930, the City Government changed its name to Shanghai City in accordance with the organization law promulgated by the National Government and abolished the Port Affairs Bureau. On July 7th, 1931, the groundbreaking ceremony for the new City Government building in the city center area was held, and construction was expected to be completed within 1932. Later, Mayor Zhang resigned due to illness before he could see its completion. On January 7th, 1932, Mr. Wu Tiecheng succeeded him. After taking office, he suddenly encountered the January 28 Incident, which lasted for more than three months. The essence of the city was destroyed, and the unprecedented catastrophe caused deep pain. An ordinary person in this situation would have felt discouraged and sought to leave quickly. However, Mayor Wu was determined to uphold the principle of "people can destroy, but I can build," and he worked even harder. The officials were moved by his determination and worked diligently. Therefore, in addition to rescuing the victims and comforting the refugees and exhausting all efforts to overcome the difficulties, he also considered the wide range of the city area, which made it difficult to maintain public security. In order to complete local security and ensure the safety of the city area, he established the Security Department on August 18th of the same year. Furthermore, considering that the post-war reconstruction was urgent and that completing the construction of the city center area was the foundation for realizing the Great Shanghai plan, he continued to proceed with the project to achieve complete success. Therefore, despite the limited resources of the city treasury, he still found ways to proceed. The central government praised his loyalty, and local leaders praised his hard work and provided full support. Therefore, the construction funds were secured. In total, the completed municipal buildings during Mayor Wu's tenure included: ㊀ Regarding administrative agencies, there were office buildings for the City Government and various bureaus and offices in the city center area. ㊁ Regarding cultural and educational undertakings, there were sports fields, gymnasiums, swimming pools, libraries, museums, zoos, botanical gardens, and newly built school buildings for municipal schools. ㊂ Regarding public safety and hygiene, there were municipal hospitals, hygiene laboratories, hygiene offices, municipal infectious disease hospitals, the municipal first public cemetery, market gardens in various districts, Wusong Park, First Park, and Wenmiao Park. ㊃ Regarding the welfare of the common people, there were seven civilian residences on Quanji'an Road, Xietu Road, Jiaotong Road, Qimei Road, Zhongshan Road, Damuqiao Road, and Pushan Road, totaling 1,848 rooms. These are all major achievements. Other constructions such as roads, bridges, and wharves in various districts are too numerous to mention individually. In short, the Shanghai of today is due to the active maintenance of the central and local governments, the active efforts of the four former mayors, the active support of the citizens, and the diligent service of the officials. Therefore, within a short period of ten years, it was possible to move from creation to construction. Although there are many unfinished tasks due to financial constraints, the future is long and promising. However, Mayor Wu was honored with a new appointment and left to preside over Guangdong Province. Although it can be said that "Guangdong has gained," it is truly "Shanghai's loss." This is what his colleagues are reluctant to part with and what the general public finds difficult to forget. The above describes the changes of mayors in Shanghai over the past ten years and the overview of their work. As for the work of the various bureaus under the City Government over the past ten years, it has also become increasingly complex and has made progress every day, from simple to complex. In terms of finance, annual revenue and expenditure have increased from over 3 million to over 10 million. In terms of land administration, since the implementation of the land value tax, the tax amount is calculated based on the land value, and the complexity of the previous regulations has been eliminated. In terms of the number of police officers, it has been increasing day by day, and the work has expanded from simple police duties to include promoting the New Life Movement and training in air defense. Recently, a police force has been organized.

The motorcade and the addition of female police officers to ensure the complete security of the city. In terms of education, the budget has increased from 290,000 to over 1.8 million, with very significant progress in the expansion of educational quantity and the improvement of quality. The number of primary schools has increased from 180 to 311, and secondary schools from 3 to 6. Regarding social education, there are more than 60 institutions, such as public education schools, public supplementary schools, and public education centers. Other measures, such as strict screening of teachers, strict supervision of private schools, the inculcation of national defense knowledge, the implementation of military education, the promotion of civic training, and the vigorous promotion of literacy campaigns, are all conscientiously followed in accordance with the central government's intentions, actively cultivating the public to seek national rejuvenation. In terms of hygiene, moving from passive treatment medicine to active preventive medicine to protect public health and increase the productivity of citizens. Therefore, active attention is paid to environmental hygiene, epidemic prevention facilities, and health education. In terms of public works, proceeding in accordance with the two major guidelines of reorganizing the old urban areas and building new urban areas. In addition to the aforementioned municipal buildings, there are extremely rational plans for the road system and the overall urban zoning, so the construction of roads, ditches, and bridges provides great convenience to the citizens. As for public utilities, focusing on the two aspects of "convenience for citizens to use" and "safety to enjoy." The former includes the reorganization of water, electricity, transportation, gas, telephone, and other services, as well as the creation of various municipal facilities. The latter includes the registration of water, electricity, transportation, and other industries. Other matters, such as how to resolve labor-management disputes and how to improve worker treatment, are handled by the Social Affairs Bureau in cooperation with the Municipal Party Department, coordinating and mediating as appropriate. All these are just a general overview, and detailed programs are all recorded in the book "Shanghai City" published by the Municipal Government. Looking back on the various works and facilities of the past ten years, although there is still a long way to go from what all parties expect and what we privately aspire to, we colleagues ask ourselves that we have indeed done our best, which is what Hongjun dares to announce to the public.

Future Work Guidelines

Hongjun has been a member of the municipal government for ten years now. This spring, when Mayor Wu was transferred to Guangdong, I was ordered to temporarily manage Shanghai's affairs. I am deeply aware of my limited abilities and fear of failure, but driven by a sense of responsibility, I dare not harbor any thoughts of simply getting by. Therefore, I have long vowed that as long as I am in office, I will do my duty for one day, in order to live up to the expectations of the central government. Governing does not require excessive words; the sages have already given clear instructions. In the future, the focus of our work should be on the pursuit of efficiency. The so-called efficiency refers to both the use of personnel and the use of funds. In terms of personnel, we should seek people who are suitable for their positions, positions that are suitable for their talents, and people who can give full play to their talents, so as not to waste talent. In terms of funds, we should assess priorities, weigh importance, use what should be used, and save what should be saved, so as not to waste the people's wealth. The highest goal of municipal administration is to seek the comfort, happiness, and progress of the general public. If something meets this goal, we will not hesitate to spend more money. If something violates this goal, we will not give it even a small amount. Hongjun holds this attitude and deeply hopes that the citizens will also hold this attitude to supervise us. As for the current urgent tasks, one is to follow the instructions of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and strive for the construction of the national economy, and the other is to promote the completion of local autonomy, as a preparation for the beginning of the constitutional era. For these two things, we should study them carefully and put them into practice in the short term. However, due to my limited knowledge and shallow experience, it is difficult to achieve what is expected. I sincerely hope that the central government officials and advanced figures attending today's meeting will give guidance. I would be extremely grateful.

Excerpts from Speeches by Various Representatives

Representative of the National Government Wang Boqun stated that Shanghai has been opened as a port for trade between China and foreign countries and has established concessions for more than ninety years. The root cause was the first unequal treaty concluded between China and foreign countries after the Opium War, the so-called Treaty of Nanjing. Although Shanghai is now known as the fifth largest commercial port in the world, most of the construction in the past ninety years was solidified in the concessions, while the Chinese areas progressed very slowly. Therefore, when Chinese and foreigners come to Shanghai and see the rapid changes in the concessions and the simplicity of the Chinese areas, they unconsciously develop erroneous perceptions, even thinking that Shanghai is the concessions and the concessions are Shanghai. This is a very shameful thing for us. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the National Revolutionary Army established Shanghai. The central government, learning from past mistakes, decided to establish Shanghai as a special city area, set up a municipal government, expand the scope, and work hard to build it. Now, in just ten years, all the new facilities related to transportation, culture, commercial ports, and society have either materialized or are actively advancing. Not only has it swept away the previous inertia, but it is also embracing the theme of "catching up" everywhere, advancing along a path suitable for the times. This vigorous situation can correct the erroneous views of Chinese and foreigners, increase the status of our country, and can also be said to be a manifestation of our national rejuvenation. Therefore, we feel infinite comfort. The reasons why Shanghai has been able to achieve this are, first, because of the Prime Minister's great and profound plan, second, because of the hard work and practical spirit of the past authorities, and third, because of the promotion of the social masses, etc. Next, the Speaker of the Municipal Council, Wang Xiaolai, said, "I, in the name of the Speaker of the Provisional Municipal Council of Shanghai and the Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, would like to briefly analyze the major relationship between today's commemoration and the future national history. When Chinese people set foot in foreign settlements and areas outside the settlements, they cannot help but feel the difference in the quality of road administration, police administration, and sanitation facilities. Travel notes written by literati in the past often used 'Ten Mile Foreign Concession' as a representative of commercial ports. Therefore, since the establishment of cities in our country, not only has it become a de facto semi-colonized, but also ideologically it has become semi-colonized. The mission of the Shanghai Municipal Government since its establishment is to overcome these environments, eradicate these thoughts, and show that the Chinese people can build a healthy and beautiful municipal administration through their own efforts. What people admire in Shanghai is nothing more than its singing stages, dance halls, and extravagance, but they do not know that this is the source of sin and not the truth of urban civilization. The center of the Shanghai Municipal Government's municipal construction is aimed at the happiness of the entire people, not based on the leisure and enjoyment of a few. Therefore, all facilities are completely based on benefiting public health, public education, and the development of industry and commerce. Facilities that meet this purpose, even if financial resources are difficult, should be worked hard to raise funds and establish a solemn and great scale. What you see in today's grand commemoration, the seven major exhibitions set up by the municipal government, is enough to prove that the spirit of municipal construction of the Shanghai Municipal Government is completely built on the foundation of education, culture, and health." Next, Party Representative Pan Gongzhan said that thanks to the cooperation of all sectors in recent years, we have made today's progress. Brother, on behalf of the Municipal Party Department, wishes it "unlimited future." Finally, Wu Tiecheng, the former mayor and chairman of Guangdong Province, said that the starting point of the construction of Greater Shanghai is the result of the joint efforts of the 3.5 million citizens of Shanghai, which is accumulated by the accumulation of every bit of effort. Future work requires the citizens of the city to work harder to maintain the past work and gradually complete the Greater Shanghai plan. Yang Hu, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, also gave a speech praising the progress of various constructions, especially in recent years, which has moved towards national rejuvenation.

A Glimpse of the Enthusiastic Atmosphere

Yesterday, the entire city was completely enveloped in the extraordinarily enthusiastic emotions of the people. It can truly be said that every household hung lanterns and decorations, and every household hung flags to celebrate. From dawn, all kinds of vehicles and pedestrians traveling from the special zone and various districts to the city center were in an endless stream. After eight o'clock, Baoshan Road, Jiangwan Road, East Sports Association Road, and Qimei Road were even more crowded with people and various vehicles. Xiangyin Road formed a straight line, with cars connected end to end in the middle of the road, and bicycles galloping on both sides. Various cars either had small flags inserted or paper decorations tied on them, fluttering in the wind like butterflies, forming a spectacle. Not only were there magnificent and grand archways on each road, but even the shantytowns were decorated with lanterns and decorations, with a thriving atmosphere that had never been seen before. Crossing Songhu Road, the "Air Defense Exhibition" set up in the city stadium first came into view. Turning east into Zhengtong Road, the exhibition hall was the "Machinery Industry Exhibition." Adjacent to the gymnasium was the "Handicraft Exhibition." The "Tea Exhibition" was in the shed to the left of the swimming pool. The "Industrial Safety Exhibition" was in Zhengtong Elementary School on Zhengzhong Road. The "Municipal Exhibition" was located in the library, and the "Document Exhibition" was located in the museum in front of the library. Further ahead was the "Health Exhibition" in the Health Experiment Institute. The "Public Entertainment Performance Stage" was in the square in front of the Municipal Government, on a scale that was unparalleled. In addition to the various venues, the intersection of Zhengtong Road and Guohe Road and the surrounding area outside the government building were temporary gathering places for shops, with everything from books and medicines to food and beverages. Entering among them, it was truly dazzling. Yesterday noon, the scorching sun was terrifying, and the general cold food stores were quite prosperous. Police officers directed the traffic, but there were inconsistencies, resulting in some cars moving forward and then backing up. Some young students went to visit the exhibition, but because they needed to buy tickets for forty cents, some returned disappointed due to insufficient funds. There was also one person blowing a horn wildly to solicit money, and the police did not intervene, which was quite inelegant. In addition, the Shanghai Local Cloth Industry Guild and the entire personnel of the 30th Squadron of citizens receiving training in this industry prepared a float, decorated with drama, for the "Qi Tian Story," and had a eulogy to celebrate.

Also, the jade display section of the Handicraft Exhibition had more than 3,000 visitors from the opening yesterday morning to the evening. They all praised the exhibits as precious and rare. Yesterday afternoon, a certain gentleman from Fujian saw two strings of pagoda beads among the exhibits and was reluctant to let them go, intending to buy them at a high price. He immediately obtained the consent of the exhibitor and bought them on the spot. Therefore, in order not to disappoint the audience, the guild and the exhibitors decided to part with most of the exhibits. It is heard that starting today, many new and exquisite emerald and gold-inlaid exhibits will be added to the display.

Various Entertainment Performances Today

Today from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the Peking Opera performance will be held at ㊀ the stage in front of the Municipal Government and ㊁ the Hunan Public Sports Field.

In addition to various lantern parades, he also gathered famous artists from various Shanghai stages to perform dramas for three days. Today is the third day.

Lantern Parade in Pudong

The Pudong community's celebration of the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Municipal Government was held at the Feixiong Sports Field on Dongchang Road at 9:30 AM yesterday. The preparations had been made by the sports association staff for a long time. Flags and decorations were hung at the entrance of the venue, and lanterns were hung high in the field, which was quite eye-catching. Hundreds of people, including members of the civic training class, police teams, and representatives from various sectors, were present. Xu Baoming, Cai Zanzhou, Shen Yu, Zhang Zaibo, and Xia Xinzhai were elected as the presidium, and they gave speeches one after another. The meeting did not end until 11:00 AM. At 6:30 PM in the evening, a lantern parade was held. The participants included students from various schools, police officers from the police station, various labor unions, and various public organizations, totaling dozens of units. The lanterns were all bright and dazzling, containing the meaning of revitalizing the national spirit and saving the country from peril amidst the excitement. They gathered and set off from Pudong Avenue, passing through Yangjiadu, Laobaitu, Shenjianong, Mugan Bridge, Qichangzhan, Lujiazai, Laiyidu, and other places, before disbanding at Dongchang Road. In addition, the Pudong Office of the Municipal Public Works Bureau and the Pudong District Fire Brigade each had lanterns hung at their entrances, which shone brightly at night, and the spectators were extremely crowded.

### Xu Shiying Postpones Departure from Shanghai for Recuperation

To Visit Huangshan in a Few Days

Mr. Xu Shiying, our ambassador to Japan, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing. Because his health has not yet recovered, he is still recuperating in his residence and rarely goes out for social events. Mr. Xu was originally scheduled to go to Hangzhou yesterday and then to Huangshan for a short stay to recuperate. However, due to obstacles, the trip was postponed. According to his family, he will leave in a few days.

### Yarn Association Executive Committee Discusses Ways to Save Plunging Yarn Prices

Four Measures Decided for Factories to Comply with Immediately - The Purpose is to Prevent Speculators from Manipulating the Market - The Federation of Labor Unions Sends a Telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Urging Strict Handling

After the market turmoil at the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange was administratively punished by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and twelve measures to crack down on yarn and cloth speculation were announced, the prices of yarn for each month plummeted and stalled on the opening day the day before yesterday. Compared with the market price of 295 yuan on June 8, the difference per package was nearly 50 yuan. The Chinese Cotton Yarn Mill Federation held a temporary executive committee meeting at its headquarters on Avenue Edward at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday. Chairman Guo Gu reported on the turmoil in the yarn and cloth market, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's thorough investigation process, and the recent plunge in cotton yarn prices and stalled trading. Then, they began to discuss. The committee members believed that the soaring and plummeting yarn prices were obviously manipulated by speculators, and the following four measures were decided:

Four Measures

㊀ Member factories should no longer deposit yarn that does not meet sales requirements into the exchange's warehouse. ㊁ Member factories should try to collect the old yarn that has already been deposited into the exchange's warehouse. ㊂ During this period of plunging yarn prices, member factories that have already sold forward yarn must all make up for it. ㊃ Although yarn sales are currently stagnant, the stock of yarn is still no more than 50,000 packages. Member factories must not sell off large amounts of yarn. The purpose of the above measures is to prevent manipulation by speculators. Member factories will be notified to comply with the measures immediately. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited Guo Shun last night and asked about the four resolutions of the Yarn Association. According to his statement, the methods were roughly the same as those mentioned above.

Telegram from the Federation of Labor Unions

(Omitted) Recently, the government thoroughly investigated the "case" of yarn trading in Shanghai. The actions were swift and resolute, and the people were inspired. The country is in such a difficult situation. How can it withstand this turmoil? This time, the government resolutely ordered strict handling, which is to protect legitimate merchants and safeguard legitimate industries. The subordinate associations listened and rejoiced beyond measure. Since this case has been handed over to the court, whether it is the bulls or the bears, anyone who has manipulated the market and harmed our industry should be dealt with equally and without exception. We will wait patiently for the court to collect evidence and display the majesty of the law, without the slightest ambiguity or favoritism, in order to maintain the dignity of the judiciary and protect the righteousness of the world. The political situation is clear, and the people will be at peace. I am eagerly awaiting orders. The Chinese Industrial Federation respectfully bows, Yu.

### Three Candidates Issue a Letter to Voters Today at the Broadcasting Association

Movie Theaters Show National Election Slogans - Urging Voters Not to Give Up Their Right to Vote

The National Election Office of this city has specially produced a large number of slogan films and distributed them to movie theaters throughout the city for publicity purposes. The candidates broadcasting today are Tong Hangbai, Chen Guangfu, and Qian Xinzhi. In addition, the National Election Promotion Association has specially printed a letter to voters. The details are as follows:

Three Candidates Broadcasting Today

Yesterday was the 10th anniversary of the Municipal Government. All radio stations suspended broadcasting and rebroadcast the report from the Municipal Government Radio Station. Therefore, the candidates' broadcasting was also suspended for one day yesterday. The candidates broadcasting today are Tong Hangbai from 5:40 PM to 6:10 PM on the Great China Radio Station, call sign XHHU, frequency 1160; Chen Guangfu from 6:40 PM to 7:10 PM on the Navigation Radio Station, call sign XHHM, frequency 1180; and Qian Xinzhi from 9:45 PM to 10:15 PM on the Buddhist Radio Station, call sign XMHB, frequency 980. In addition, the National Election Office will send personnel to broadcast various national election regulations, etc., on the Ministry of Transportation Radio Station from 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM, call sign XQHC, frequency 230.

Movie Theaters Showing Slogan Films

In order to expand publicity, the National Election Office has not only invited candidates to broadcast speeches and printed a large number of large and small five-color slogans for distribution and posting, but also specially produced more than ten kinds of slogan films for movie audiences in various movie theaters throughout the city, which will be inserted and shown when the movies are screened, in order to publicize the election. In addition, the National Election Promotion Association of this city specially issued a letter to voters yesterday in order to facilitate citizens' attention to the national election, as follows:

Promotion Association Issues Letter to Voters

"Voters from all walks of life, the convocation of the National Assembly is a great turning point in which China transforms from division to unity, from weakness to revival, and from tutelage to constitutional government. The election of National Assembly representatives is the main task in completing the above transformation and is a concrete manifestation of our compatriots promoting civil rights, enhancing personality, and loving and respecting the country. The importance of this cannot be overstated. However, with only ten days left before the general election, election work is already actively underway. The voters of our city should also make preparations. I respectfully offer a few key points and ask voters from all walks of life to do them in order to fulfill the people's mission to the country: (A) Participate enthusiastically in the election. Do not casually give up the sovereignty that you have struggled to obtain. Look at how the Germans, when voting, had their overseas citizens in Shanghai go to warships to vote, and some even flew back from Shanghai to vote specifically on the issue of Saar's affiliation. It can be seen that whether voters cherish their political power is a distinction between the civilized and uncivilized of a nation. Your abandoning of your vote, although not of great importance, is representative of the low level of cultural development of this nation if everyone does the same. Therefore, everyone's enthusiastic participation in the election is enough to raise our country's reputation and status. (B) Pay attention to the date, time, location, and procedures for voting. The voting date for this city has been set for the 18th of this month. Missing this time means there will be no possibility of a make-up vote, which is the same as giving up the right to vote. You must be careful. Also, wherever you registered and swore an oath before, it is best to go to the original location to vote, because they can check your voter registration and give you a ballot. In addition, the election rules and procedures will be announced by the office in the future. Please take a close look at them. (C) Earnestly follow the spirit of electing the virtuous and capable to choose the most virtuous, just, and excellent candidates to be representatives, because whether the representatives are talented or not is greatly related to the success or failure of national policies. Do not be swayed by personal feelings or used by others. (D) Pay attention to the qualifications and ideas of the candidates. This association has tried its best to introduce the candidates' resumes and invite them to broadcast speeches for voters' reference. Please pay attention."

### National Products Community Discusses Expanding Southeast Asian Market

Participating in the National Exhibition to Discuss Methods Today - Industrial Foreign Association Meeting on the 16th

Our country's development of the Southeast Asian market has made progress since the return of the Southeast Asian Commercial Delegation. Recently, we have especially focused on the promotion of national products in Singapore. National Products Exhibition Halls and National Products Commercial Firms have also been established one after another. The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the City Chamber of Commerce will hold a meeting today to discuss ways to participate in the Singapore National Products Exhibition. The principles of participation have already been decided. The China Industrial Foreign Trade Association will hold a general meeting of members on the 16th to discuss all important matters. A reporter from Shenzhou News Agency has made a detailed report as follows:

Shanghai Manufacturers Participating in the National Exhibition

The Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce is hosting the 3rd Chinese National Products Exhibition, which is scheduled to open on Double Ten Day this year. They have sent a representative, Lin Ziming, back to the country to solicit exhibits in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Lin was given a banquet by the City Chamber of Commerce and other organizations the day before yesterday. At the banquet, he expressed his opinions on hosting the National Exhibition and stated the urgent need to develop overseas markets. Major manufacturers in this city believe that in the past two National Exhibitions, this city's manufacturers have sent representatives to participate with their products, and the results have been very good. Therefore, they all expressed their approval of the principles of participation. A joint meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Municipal Local Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, and the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association will be held at the China Exchange Building this afternoon at 5:30 PM to discuss the participation methods. Mr. Lin Yuming will attend the meeting to detail the preparations for the exhibition.

General Meeting of the Industrial Foreign Association

The China Industrial Foreign Trade Association has been established for several years and has made considerable achievements in developing Southeast Asian trade and promoting association affairs. Now, the association has decided to hold a general meeting of members at the Zhengyi Society on Youjing Road on the 16th of this month to discuss the association's progress and various important matters related to the development of foreign trade. However, because it is during the National Election period, the election of the association's directors will be temporarily postponed in accordance with regulations. I have inquired about the association's affairs as follows: ㊀ Matters related to the investigation of the domestic and foreign market conditions of domestic industrial products; ㊁ Matters related to the expansion of the foreign market of domestic industrial products; ㊂ Matters related to the promotion of the standardization of domestic industrial products; ㊃ Matters related to the exploration and purchase of domestic industrial raw materials; ㊄ Matters related to the display of samples of domestic industrial products; ㊅ Matters related to the joint sales and publicity of domestic industrial products to foreign countries; ㊆ Matters related to the promotion of cooperation among the industry, etc. It is heard that this general meeting will pay close attention to the issue of developing overseas markets.

### Kang Wenzhi Went to Nanjing Yesterday

Mr. Kang Wenzhi has been extremely busy with social events since returning to Shanghai from Japan. It is learned that Mr. Kang went to Nanjing yesterday. Before leaving, he talked about the Sino-Japanese issue, saying that our prerequisite is to enrich ourselves in order to be conducive to the solution of the Sino-Japanese issue. Today, when talking about friendship, peace, and morality, we must be based on a balance of power, otherwise it is equivalent to empty talk.

### Municipal Party Headquarters' Northern Expedition Oath-Taking Rally Tomorrow

### Small Motor Vehicles Not Allowed to Enter the Public Concession

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Public Concession Authorities to Avert Panic of Rickshaw Pullers' Unemployment

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Public Concession's Bureau of Works, stating: "Respectfully, (previous content omitted) Upon investigation, your Bureau's reduction of rickshaws within the concession was originally intended to alleviate traffic congestion. The rickshaw industry, considering the public interest, reluctantly sacrificed business and complied with your Bureau's measures. However, the operation of small motor vehicles, which can stop and go anywhere, will inevitably cause greater traffic congestion than before the reduction of rickshaws. Moreover, since they can pass through small lanes and secluded paths, rickshaws may be naturally eliminated, leading to the unemployment of many commoners who rely on rickshaw pulling for their livelihood. Considering the two aspects mentioned above, our Chamber believes that these small motor vehicles should not be allowed to extend their routes to the Public Concession to avoid causing panic among a large number of rickshaw pullers who would lose their jobs, thereby hindering the lives of the masses and the public security within the concession. We hereby write to inform you and hope that you will investigate and handle the matter accordingly and provide a response."

### Dredging Bureau Dredges Rice Industry Wharf

From the South City's 16th Pier south to Dongjiadu Pier is a shoreline area rented by the Municipal Public Utility Bureau for ferry terminals. The Dredging Bureau has been requested to dredge the shoals to facilitate the docking of ships. The area south of Dongjiadu Pier to the South Pier has always been a wharf area for civilian ships. In the past, when digging mud at the ferry terminal, Xing Zhigang, a representative of the shipping industry, repeatedly requested the Dredging Bureau to dredge the area to the civilian ship wharf to facilitate transportation. Starting in late May, Director Xue Zhuobin of the Dredging Bureau approved the dredging from the area south of Dongjiadu. Currently, the dredging is reaching the rice industry wharf in the South City. If the dredging continues smoothly to Gaochangmiao Pier, it is estimated that it will take four months to complete.

### Japanese Consulate Police Arrest Korean in French Concession Again

Therefore, the search was intensified. According to reliable sources, Zhang Zhijia, a Korean, was arrested in the French Concession of this city.

### Drug Trafficking Den Cracked Down in Yangjiadu

Seven Arrested, Drugs Confiscated

Wang Shifu, the captain of the detective team of the Pudong Police Sub-Bureau, learned that there was a drug trafficking den in Yujiamiao, Yangjiadu, and other places. At 7 PM the night before, he led detectives Cheng Peizhang, Liu Changrui, Jiang Binru, Ren Tao, and others, together with the Yangjiadu police station chief, to Zhang Baosheng's house at No. 27 Chenjiazhai, Laobaidu, and arrested seven people: Zeng Renguo, Zhang Baosheng, Ding Axiang, Yang Heshang, Feng Youyou, Zhang Amao, Lu Miaosheng, and others. Twelve small packets of heroin, two boxes of opium paste (totaling 45 pieces), and legal tender of 5 yuan and 15 cents were confiscated. Ding Axiang admitted that the drugs belonged to her. Since Guo Cheng was a monk in Yujiamiao, he dared to be involved in drug trafficking. Liu Tan and police officer Zhang Zhaochang accompanied the monk to his room in Yujiamiao. Behind the mirror frame, they found twelve small packets of heroin and an opium-smoking license that did not match Guo Cheng's identity. According to Guo Cheng, he entrusted someone to obtain it for him, and it was a mistake. The suspects were taken to the headquarters yesterday morning for further investigation.

### Money Exchange Industry Chambers Start Oaths Yesterday Not to Accept Fake Manchukuo Currency

Those Who Violate the Oath are Willing to Accept Punishment; Manufacturers' Association Petitions Ministry of Finance to Intervene

The Shanghai Money Exchange Industry Association sent a letter to all member money shops, stating: "Respectfully, according to the letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which stated that recently, the Yokohama Specie Bank, the Bank of Taiwan, the Bank of Chosen, and the Shanghai Bank have transported a large number of counterfeit 'Manchukuo' Central Bank banknotes to Shanghai and have begun exchanging them. Many have been discovered in the market. These treacherous merchants are only interested in profit and disregard the national entity. Taking the concessions as a protective charm and relying on the insurance of the Japanese, they openly accept the exchange, which urgently needs to be investigated and strictly prohibited from circulating. The handling of the matter should be reported back for relay. The loss of the Eastern Provinces is unrecovered to this day. All citizens should be vigilant at all times to avenge the country. How can they act as traitors and seek petty profits and leave a bad name for ten thousand years? Therefore, it is specially notified that each should be cautious and not accept the exchange of these counterfeit 'Manchukuo' banknotes. If you do not heed the advice and it is verified that a member has accepted the exchange, this association will only obey the order to secretly report to the competent authorities for investigation. At that time, your reputation will be ruined, and you will regret it too late. This is a solemn notice, and I hope you pay attention to it." Also, member money shops have taken oaths since yesterday not to accept the exchange of counterfeit "Manchukuo" banknotes. Those who violate the oath are willing to accept the most severe punishment. This oath paper is signed and sealed by the managers of each shop to show solemnity. Also, the China National Products Manufacturers Association, based on reports that Japanese merchants such as the Yokohama Specie Bank, the Bank of Taiwan, the Bank of Chosen, and the Shanghai Bank have recently transported a large number of "counterfeit Manchukuo" Central Bank banknotes, attempting to use them in Shanghai, specially submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting them to quickly send personnel to thoroughly investigate and strictly prohibit them. The original petition stated: "Respectfully petitioning for the dispatch of personnel to thoroughly investigate the Japanese merchants, such as the Yokohama Specie Bank, etc., who have privately transported a large number of "counterfeit Manchukuo" Central Bank banknotes to Shanghai, attempting to use them, please quickly and strictly prohibit the matter. Recently, according to newspaper reports, Japanese merchants in Shanghai, such as the Yokohama Specie Bank, etc., have privately transported "counterfeit Manchukuo" Central Bank banknotes of one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, and other three denominations, totaling several million yuan, to Shanghai for mixed use and have already begun contacting certain money shops, etc., requesting them to exchange them to facilitate circulation in the market. The news spread, and the public was shocked. The four northeastern provinces are our country's territory, which has been temporarily unable to exercise its functions due to violent coercion. Even all countries in the world have unanimously refused to recognize "Manchukuo." Now, the counterfeit Central Bank banknotes are openly transported to Shanghai in large quantities, attempting to mix them in. Examining the intentions of the instigators, it is not only to disrupt the financial situation in our city but also to insult our national system. In addition to notifying all member manufacturers to unanimously refuse to use these counterfeit banknotes, we earnestly request your Ministry to quickly dispatch personnel to thoroughly investigate, negotiate, and prohibit them in order to maintain the national system and protect financial security. We cannot express our expectations too much. We respectfully submit."

### Young Postpartum Woman Dies Suddenly After Doctor Gives Two Injections

Mother-in-Law and Biological Mother Both Witness the Tragedy; Doctor Liu Baorong Taken Into Custody

Xue Guixing, a Chongming native and owner of the Ruixingguan Restaurant at No. 166 Kangti Road in the French Concession, is 37 years old. Because he has no son, he adopted his brother's son, named Miaoxin (20 years old this year), as his heir and helped with managing the restaurant. Last year, through a matchmaker, he married Ni, a Songjiang woman (17 years old this year), to Miaoxin. The young couple lived together on the upper level of the three-story shop. Ni was pregnant for the first time and went to term. Her mother, Ni Wang, came from Songjiang to Shanghai to accompany her daughter during childbirth. On the 6th of this month at midnight, Ni felt abdominal pain and fetal movement, knowing that labor was imminent, so she hired an old-style midwife to assist in the delivery. At 4 AM yesterday morning, she safely gave birth to twins. Xue Guixing and his wife and his mother-in-law, Ni Wang, were overjoyed. At 12 PM yesterday, the postpartum woman again felt abdominal cramps, so she went to Canaan Hospital at No. 19 Father Lao Road to seek medical treatment. Dr. Liu Baorong (46 years old, from Hunan), the director of the hospital, went to diagnose the patient at 1:30 PM in the afternoon. After examining her, Liu thought that the room on the upper level where the postpartum woman lived was small and the air was stuffy and not circulating well, so he ordered the patient's family to use an electric fan to regulate the air. Then, he ordered the postpartum woman to lie on the bed. After Liu took her pulse, he took out a vial of medicine and a syringe and gave her an injection in each of her left and right arms. Unexpectedly, immediately after the second injection, the postpartum woman's complexion changed drastically, her eyes rolled back, and she died. At that time, the postpartum woman's mother-in-law, husband, and biological mother all witnessed the incident. They all believed that the doctor's injections were inappropriate, resulting in the accident. In addition to mourning, they all argued with the doctor. However, Liu claimed that the postpartum woman had other diseases and that the injections were definitely not fatal and would not take responsibility for it. For a time, the small room was noisy and crowded. They surrounded Dr. Liu and would not let him leave. They called the Huayue Patrolmen to come. The patrolmen took Dr. Liu Baorong to the Yujiawan Central Police Station to report, accusing Liu of being a quack doctor who killed people. The chief sent detectives to investigate, and the body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for an autopsy. The doctor was temporarily detained, and the Special No. 2 Court was requested to send personnel to examine the body before handling it.

### Huangpu River to Have High Tide Starting Tomorrow

Flood Prevention Works to Be Completed; Sewers to Be Blocked with Wooden Plugs to Prevent Water from Entering

Starting today, the Huangpu River will have a high tide. The construction of the flood prevention works on the Bund has been largely completed. The Datong News Agency reporter has recorded the details as follows:

High Tide Prediction

According to the Qingpu General Administration's forecast, the Huangpu River will have a high tide starting today. The time will be before dawn, and the predicted amount will be about eleven feet. It can recede after dawn. At the same time, there will also be high tides from the 9th to the 13th. According to the prediction, the lowest amount will be ten feet, and the highest will reach eleven feet and nine inches, close to the embankments.

Flood Prevention to Be Completed

The flood prevention works on the Bund, since the Bureau of Works of the Municipal Council actively started construction, from the Bund on the south side of Aiduya Road to the Bund on the north side of Jiujiang Road, have been completed. Only a few sections of the project still need to be inlaid with gravel on the exterior of the barrier to make them more beautiful.

Sewer Water Blocking

Regarding the situation where tidal water often flows backwards and emerges from the sewers onto the road surface, the Bureau of Works has already prepared sewer wooden plugs to be used to block the sewer entrance before the tide arrives and will be pulled out after the tide recedes. Therefore, low-lying road surfaces this year can be spared from waterlogging.

### Girl Scalded to Death by Overturned Hot Porridge

One Girl Severely Injured

Li Aid, (11 years old), and Li Renying, (5 years old), the eldest and youngest daughters of Feng Aqiao, a Ningbo native who sweeps the alley at No. 375 Baoding Road Heda Lane, were reportedly severely scalded by hot porridge. The reason was that the day before yesterday at noon, their father placed a pot of cooked porridge on a washboard inside the wooden shed in the alley. Aid suddenly wanted to sleep on the board, causing the pot to overturn. After their father saw it, he immediately sent the two girls to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. Aid died due to severe injuries before she could be treated. Renying is still being treated and is said to be in danger of death. The hospital reported it to the Huishan Police Station, who ordered detectives to investigate. The body was transported to the Feilun Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhang Zongru of the First Special Court came to the morgue to verify that the corpse was indeed scalded to death. Mr. Zhang also gave 5 yuan to the father of the deceased, who was extremely poor, out of compassion, and ordered him to prepare a coffin and collect the body.

### Yang Qinghe Jiuji Cleared, Depositors Lose Huge Sums

Shareholder Shao Yueru Has Fraudulent Behavior; Arrested and Interrogated After Being Reported by Creditors

Yang Qinghe Jiuji Silver Shop, located at the intersection of Henan Road and Nanjing Road, owed a considerable amount of money when it was declared for liquidation. After the accountant Jiang Wanping completed the liquidation, all creditors were uniformly reimbursed at a rate of 20%. However, four people, Shi Yiji, Guo Zhoutao, Kuai Shaoqing, Tang Renchu, and others, had a total of 115,665.78 yuan in deposits in the silver shop. At that time, in addition to being reimbursed for 20%, totaling 23,313.33 yuan, they still owed 92,533.78 yuan, and there was no concrete solution. Shi Yiji and others sued the silver shop in the civil court, accusing Shao Yueru (54 years old, a Shaoxing native, residing at No. 686 Haige Road), a partner of the silver shop. During the trial, Shao requested a settlement, promising to pay 13,000 yuan in cash first and issuing five China Industrial Bank promissory notes, totaling 18,389 yuan. In addition to the cash portion being guaranteed by the Zhenjiang Zhongyu Pawnshop, two English land deeds of No. 1291 and No. 2767 on Jing'an Temple Road were also provisionally seized. Unexpectedly, Shao Yueru's five promissory notes could not be cashed when they became due, and the funds guaranteed by the Zhenjiang Zhongyu Pawnshop were also stopped by Shao. The seized English land deeds had already been sold by Shao. Under these circumstances, Shao actually had fraudulent behavior. Shi and others jointly reported to the General Police Station, but Shao's whereabouts were unknown, so he could not be arrested. It was not until the 6th of this month that Chinese Detective Zhang Mingde and Detective Mao Yunlong learned that Shao Yueru was residing at No. 686 Haige Road, so they arrested and detained Shao. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a public prosecution according to Article 339 of the Criminal Law for fraud and Article 356 of the same law for destruction of property, and stated the case. Shi Yiji and others also hired a lawyer to attend the court and filed a private prosecution. Judge Zhan ruled that the case was complicated and ordered the defendant to be detained and rescheduled for a hearing in seven days after further investigation.

### Gao Yuzhu Responds to Yunnan's Denial of His Statement

Gao Yuzhu, a representative of the native headmen from the southwestern border, and Yu Jiecai, a representative of the people's petition, have been in Beijing for nearly a year since they came north last year to petition the central authorities. They are now preparing to return south to engage in development according to the guidelines shown by the central government. Unexpectedly, it was reported that the native headmen of Yunnan Province sent a telegram to the central government declaring their denial. The Datong News Agency reporter felt that this matter was of great importance, so he specially interviewed Gao and Yu at the Delin Apartment Hotel. According to them, the actions of the native headmen of that province actually hindered the progress of ethnic communication and the future, which is deeply regrettable. They specially put forward eight reasons to allow people from all walks of life to understand and will petition the central government to quickly investigate and clarify the truth. The reasons are as follows: ❶ The petition representatives from the border areas of Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces have signed and sealed documents to the central government. ❷ The area of each province is vast, and transportation is inconvenient. It is difficult to have all the native headmen sign, but for the sake of ethnic petitions, all native headmen should be able to express their feelings. ❸ Facts prove that the intention of the petition is for justice and there are no selfish intentions. ❹ Some native headmen in the inland of each province have no need to participate because of the conversion of native governance to regular governance. ❺ After the petition was delivered to the central government, the central government ordered the local government to conduct on-site investigations. ❻ This petition has lasted for more than a year. In addition to making statements to the relevant authorities, there have been a total of three petitions. The central government adopted them, and the Chinese people sympathized. Now the central government has separately begun the work. The petition has come to an end. The representatives are ordered to return south to handle publicity, investigation, education, and other matters (there are orders, forms, passports, and other items as evidence). ❼ This petition, because the results were satisfactory, aroused the suspicion of some native headmen or was used by foreigners to deliberately provoke discord, destroy ethnic unity, reduce border defense capabilities, and allow them to invade. ❽ We originally planned to return south to work in compliance with the order within a short period of time, but now we should petition the central government to investigate.

### Fierce Wife Wants Husband to Fantasize About Her

Paste Husband's Bazi Under Toilet; Assaulting Mother-in-Law Resulted in a Fine of Five Yuan

Bao Lin, a Ningbo native living at No. 5 Shunyang Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession, is 53 years old and has a son named Yufeng, who is nearly 30 years old. He married a fellow villager, Zhang (23 years old this year), as his wife. Zhang is naturally fierce. Not only does she often abuse her mother-in-law, Lin, but she also wants to subdue her husband and kneel at her pomegranate skirt. Zhang is also very superstitious. When she moved last month, she pasted her husband Bao Xingfeng's Bazi under the toilet in the hope that her husband would always submit to her. Unexpectedly, it was recently discovered by her mother-in-law, who only slightly reprimanded her. Knowing that Zhang would not accept it, she became angry out of shame and resorted to violence, injuring her mother-in-law, Lin, in the chest and waist. Bao Lin reported to the French police. The detectives took Bao Zhang to the Special No. 2 Court. The police department filed a public prosecution for the crime of injuring an elder. Judge Zhang Minsheng interrogated the defendant and ordered bail. The plaintiff submitted the injury to the French Medical Office for examination and rescheduled the hearing. Yesterday morning, the court session continued. After Judge Zhang interrogated the plaintiff and defendant in detail, he ordered a debate and then sentenced Bao Zhang to a fine of five yuan for assaulting and insulting an elder to serve as a warning.

### Women's Groups Will Hold a Meeting Tomorrow to Report on the Petition

Women's groups in this city specially sent representatives Lin Keting, Lu Lihua, Qian Jianqiu, Zhu Fengzheng, and more than 20 others to attend the National Women's Election Representative Conference in Nanjing in order to strive for participation in the constitutional process. The representatives have returned to Shanghai one after another due to the completion of their mission. The reporter of the Xinsheng News Agency specially visited Ms. Zhu Kuangzheng yesterday to inquire about the conference process. Ms. Zhu replied that the results of the conference were very satisfactory. When petitioning the central government, the Secretary-General of the Central Government, Ye Chuqia, personally received them and put forward three conditions: ❶ Produce female representatives in the primary election ❷ Appoint more female representatives among the 200 people ❸ Appoint more female quotas in the special elections. Ye Ye accepted and promised to forward it to the central government for handling. Also, women's groups in this city will convene a joint meeting again at 5 PM on the 9th, at which time the attending representatives will report on the conference process.

### Land Administration Bureau Surveys and Maps Shanghai City Area

Accurate and Complete, Nothing Can Compare; Shanghai Industrial Trust Society Sells

The Shanghai Land Administration Bureau, in view of the fact that the Shanghai maps sold in the market are mostly old-fashioned and have many omissions, printed and sold the "Shanghai City Area Current Status Map" prepared by the bureau to benefit all sectors of society. This map was obtained by the bureau after spending several years and using the manpower of dozens of people to conduct on-site surveys. It has been continuously supplemented and revised. It was recently drawn to completion and submitted to the Ministry of the Interior for permission to publish it. Therefore, its novelty and accuracy are far from comparable to general publications. All new roads, public buildings, etc. opened before May 1937 are recorded in detail without omission. The names of townships and post offices are also recorded in detail. The districts in the city are also outlined in red lines, which is particularly distinctive. Property owners and real estate developers can get a lot of convenience. It is said that the map has been printed and published by the Commercial Press, and it is exceptionally beautiful and clear. The Shanghai Industrial Trust Society at No. 66 Tianjin Road is the general agent for sale, and the price is set at two yuan per copy. The Shenbao Hall, China Travel Agency, Author Bookstore, Qixin Bookstore, Huiwentang, Beixin Bookstore, etc. also sell it. In the midst of celebrating the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Municipal Government, the bureau's publication of this map is a great contribution.

### Foreign Inspector of the Water and Electricity Company Resented by Workers, Eyes Blinded

More than ten suspects have been arrested. The court concluded the interrogation yesterday and set a date for sentencing.

A Westerner named Knox, who worked as an inspector at the Yangshupu branch of the Shanghai Water and Electricity Company, was in charge of managing workers and was known for his strictness. Public resentment accumulated. On the evening of December 28th last year, at 9:50 PM, while traveling by car near Avenue Dubail and Rue Bourgeois, he was attacked by thugs who threw nitric acid at his face. His eyes were severely injured, resulting in blindness. Subsequently, the Municipal Council offered a reward of 200 taels of gold to apprehend the culprits, but without success. Recently, Chinese detectives Ji Xiucheng from the Yangshupu Police Station, Yang Xinzheng and Yuan Xinzong from the Jiaxing Road Police Station, and detective Li Yinmin, jointly apprehended ten suspects in the Chinese and foreign concessions: Tan Fusheng, Zhu Derong, Shi Along, Zhao Zhilin, Zheng Jinlong, Zhu Guozhi, Pan Honggen, and suspects Shen Chunsheng, Zhu Wenliang, and Feng Zhaocai. They were separately sent to the First Special District Court. After investigation, three suspects were found to be unrelated and released, while the rest were remanded for further investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai Rongduo presided over the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Police lawyer Li Zhuanshan stated that after further investigation, it was found that the defendants Zhu Dehan, Shi Along, Zhao Zhilin, and Gao Jinlong were workers at the victim's company in Yangshupu and were the instigators. They harbored resentment towards Knox. The defendant Zhu Guozhi, who worked at the Water and Electricity Company on Yu Zhi Liao Road, was transferred to the Yangshupu branch. He borrowed money from the defendants Zhu Derong and others and discussed the violent nature of the Western employee Knox, suggesting a way to deal with him. Zhu Guozhi seized the opportunity and said that he could find thugs to injure him, preventing him from entering the factory to work. If a new Western employee was hired, they could expect better treatment. On the 20th of that month, Zhu Guozhi, Shi Along, Zhao Zhilin, and Gao Jinlong gathered at Zhu Derong's house. Zhu Guozhi said that it would cost 400 yuan to find someone to carry out the plan. You Xushan and Zhu Guozhi found their fugitive friend Shi Jinzhi and then discussed the matter with the defendant Pan Honggen (who ran a restaurant at 608 Datong Road in Zhabei). The defendant Tan Fusheng, who was an employee at the restaurant, was instructed to splash nitric acid on Knox. Beforehand, Zhu Guozhi often went to the entrance of the Yangshupu Company to wait for Knox to leave the factory and return home, tracking his route several times. That evening, knowing that Knox was working a night shift, he handed a bottle of nitric acid to Tan Fusheng, instructing him to splash it on Knox's face on the way and then escape. Now, a public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 278 of the Criminal Law, for inflicting injury by electricity, requesting severe punishment. Subsequently, the victim Knox testified about what happened. The defendants blamed each other. They hired lawyers Fan Gang, Fan Qisheng, Shen Xingxia, and Zhang Yongqing to represent them, requesting lenient sentences. The interrogation ended after noon. Judge Dai ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody, pending sentencing.

### Japanese Man Jealous of Japanese Prostitute, Bites Off Nose

According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily, Mizuno Sojun, an employee of a certain Japanese company on Ningwu Road, had been seeing Kamii Yasuko, a 40-year-old prostitute who lived on Peng Road. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 4th, a man named Oue Norio, who lived on Tangen Road, also went to the prostitute's house. Oue was already drunk. Upon seeing Mizuno inside, he became jealous and pushed Yasuko to the ground. Mizuno, seeing Yasuko as a weak woman, felt that she should not be treated so badly and attacked Oue. The two fought, falling from the third floor to the second floor. Oue, exhausted, bit Mizuno's nose and left cheek. Mizuno, in extreme pain, lost his ability to resist. Both were seriously injured. Half of Mizuno's nose was bitten off, and he was rushed to Fumin Hospital for treatment. At this time, the police station of the Consulate General had heard the news and rushed to the scene, summoning Oue to the station for questioning.

### A Live Drama

— Ruo Yun

The world is truly a big stage. Throughout history, countless live dramas of joys and sorrows have been performed. The recent election and coronation of the new king of the Gypsy tribe in Warsaw not only makes people realize that this is a comedy, but even the costumes and props for this comedy are borrowed from the municipal theater. This makes people feel "realistic" and can't help but wonder if this comedy is real or fake.

According to a Havas dispatch from Warsaw on the 4th by the Central News Agency: "The Gypsy people held a representative conference here at the Army Sports Ground and elected Yaziansh Kevek as the King of the Gypsies of the world and crowned him… … According to the traditional regulations of the Gypsy people, the voters should be 30 "elders", but 13 people abstained, so only 17 people participated in the voting. These people were all wearing silk jackets with patches, or top hats, or regular hats. After the election results were announced, Bishop Davolowizi, the Greek Orthodox bishop of Warsaw, performed the coronation ceremony for King Janusz. The crown was made of bronze and plated with gold. The bishop then gave a scepter to King Janusz and placed a blue cloak on his body. The cloak was edged with silver sable and woven with lilies. It was used in the Warsaw Municipal Theater's performance of Shakespeare's tragedy "King Lear." Other items such as tables, chairs, back cushions, and carpets were also borrowed from the theater. The tables and chairs were made of cardboard and the chairs were also plated with gold, acting as thrones. After the coronation ceremony was completed, 21 firecrackers were set off to replace the ceremonial cannons. The 17 "elders" all knelt before the king to show their loyalty, and a group of princes, dressed in ragged clothes, followed by many attendants in theatrical costumes, expressed their loyalty to the new king. The new king then issued a declaration……"

If this live drama were made into a newsreel, it would be very "business-minded." The audience would also sigh that it was a feast for the eyes. But unfortunately, we can only appreciate some of the scenery from the newspaper. Even so, it is enough to make people laugh.

The content and form of this comedy are quite unified. When we close our eyes and imagine King Janusz wearing a blue cloak and sitting on a "throne" made of cardboard, receiving the congratulations of his courtiers, we can't help but laugh, right? But what's even more ridiculous is their dream. The princes and ministers have their official addiction. Even if there is no small court, then even wearing "theatrical costumes" and "kneeling down" is good. When Sun Wukong became Bi Mawen, he was so happy that he shouted "I have become an official." There is a good reason for this.

Looking at the reasons for Janusz's election, we can say that it is due to his "political platform." According to the report, his "political platform" is "to find land for the nation so that it can live in peace and no longer wander the world." It is certainly very painful for a nation to be without land and to make a living by "wandering the world." However, what Janusz and his "elders" are striving for is probably to prioritize the country over the people. In other words, whether the people "live in peace" is secondary. The important thing is that there must be land, so that they can be kings and ministers. Otherwise, I don't think there would be a "fierce fight" that resulted in "ten dead and twenty injured," let alone opposition!

Janusz will soon go to see Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. "It is said that Mussolini has agreed to open up an area in Abyssinia for the Gypsy people to serve as the territory of the Gypsy people." This is probably reliable. Mussolini is suffering from the inability to conquer Abyssinia. Now, let the Gypsies take the lead, go to reclaim the land, and use slaves to control slaves, both doing good and gaining a confidant. Naturally, he can't ask for more. As for Janusz and his "elders" and his subordinates, although they will still have to shed some blood and sweat, and although they will have to listen to Mussolini's orders in the future, living their imperial life in a small court, at least the blue cloak no longer needs to be borrowed from the municipal theater, and the princes and ministers no longer have to wear patched-up ceremonial clothes, and no longer have to wear "theatrical costumes." That is also "getting what they want," not to mention that there is an official addiction to satisfy. As for "loyalty" and "allegiance," they already had it when they were ragged. How can they forget the grace of the giver after they are "rich and honored"? Mussolini is insightful, so he can rest assured.

### Bai Yushuang is Expelled Again

— Zi Ming

Bengbeng opera was once extremely popular in Shanghai, which should be attributed to Bai Yushuang. Later Kun opera actresses all abandoned their birthplace and went south because Bengbeng opera was popular in Shanghai and could sell tickets. Recently, there has even been a trend of developing from Shanghai to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. However, Bai Yushuang came to Shanghai to perform because she was driven out by Yuan Liang. Salacious words and songs were quite to the taste of Shanghai people. Several plays, such as "Being Shot" and "Opening a Shop," were indeed full of seats and received thunderous applause. Later, she even started rehearsing new plays, from "Hunting Wild Chickens" to long-term performances.

It is said that Bengbeng opera is a kind of miscellaneous tune from the north, performed exclusively in vulgar places. There are no "props" or so-called scenery, just like the solo plays performed in the streets and alleys of Shanghai. To cater to the audience, they specialize in singing lewd songs about the private affairs of men and women. After coming to Shanghai, the situation was different. Props and scenery were all available. The author once saw a play called "Du Shiniang Angrily Sinks the Treasure Chest." Although the words were vulgar, it was hard to see anything lewd. Perhaps the script had been censored and was no longer what it originally looked like. However, Bai Yushuang relied on "obscenity, lewdness, and flirtatiousness" to make a fortune, which was probably something she never dreamed of.

Later, this "lewd actress" disappeared due to love problems. It was not until recently that we learned that she had returned to Tianjin and was "arranging" with all parties, asking to continue performing. Perhaps the situation in Tianjin is getting tighter, and whether an actress is lewd or not, expulsion is considered done. Moreover, after "arranging," it is human nature to provide convenience. News came that "Bai Yushuang plans to perform the Bengbeng opera 'Yu Tang Chun' at the new theater in the Tianjin Japanese Concession on the evening of the 7th, with a three-month contract, after which she will go to Shanghai." But the spoil sport is that "on the 6th, more than 70 citizens, including Zhang Xinqiu, jointly presented a petition to the municipal government, saying that the acting expressions are obscene and should be stopped from performing and expelled from the country." (See yesterday's newspaper) It is not clear whether "Yu Tang Chun" can be performed on the evening of the 7th. Probably, some more "official business" will have to be done, and expulsion will be a good thing, right?

I have only seen one play by Bai Yushuang, so I cannot say to what extent her "expressions are obscene." However, "Yu Tang Chun" is clearly "Yu Tang Chun." I have seen the Peking opera "Yu Tang Chun." Although it is also about the private affairs of men and women, there is nothing lewd about it. Moreover, in the "three-court trial" scene, if the blue robe is properly dressed, Wang Jinlong, after becoming a high official, will reveal his embarrassment, which can be quite satisfying. Perhaps Su San is a prostitute, and Wang Jinlong and others are "insulted," so it is not convenient to say more.

Earlier, General Song Zheyuan banned the performance of "Walking to Maicheng" and "Wind and Wave Pavilion" because they could make "heroes short of breath." There are even more spoken dramas that are banned from being performed, and Shanghai also has a Concession Inspection Committee. I really don't want to say more – although these are all digressions.
