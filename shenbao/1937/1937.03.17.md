[Nanjing] President Chiang gave a speech at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 16th when he hosted Chairman Kodama and others, saying, "Chairman Kodama and distinguished guests, it is truly an honor to have the opportunity to host you today. Since hearing the news of your upcoming visit, our country, both government and public, has been eagerly anticipating the arrival of esteemed guests. We especially welcome you, the experienced, respected, and renowned figures from the Japanese business community. All of you have friendly relations with China in various aspects, whether directly or indirectly. We would rather say that we are welcoming old friends of many years than welcoming an economic inspection group. You are all veteran pioneers who have devoted yourselves to Japan's economic construction since the Meiji Restoration. You have personally experienced the difficulties at the beginning of national construction and deeply understand the joys and hardships of the nation-building process. I believe you have a particularly deep sympathy for our country, which is currently in the construction phase. Our Premier Sun Yat-sen once said that China's National Revolution is like Japan's Meiji Restoration. Perhaps it can be said that what China encountered was even more particularly difficult. The Chinese government, the economic sector, and the business community are striving forward with the same spirit as Japan during the Meiji Restoration era. We have particularly deep expectations for friendly mutual assistance and guidance from our predecessors. We hope that you will use your rich experience to provide as much criticism and guidance as possible on all aspects of China's construction, economic, and industrial matters. Our Chinese business community will surely accept it with enthusiasm and will definitely follow your good example of contributing to the country, so that China and Japan can both advance side by side in culture and economy and serve as a guarantee for peace and welfare in East Asia. We Orientals should respect Oriental culture. I believe you all agree with this point. Orientals can never leave Oriental culture, just as neighboring countries will always be neighbors. Geography and history are immutable. If Eastern nations do not have Eastern culture as their foundation, they will never be able to coexist harmoniously with other nations. The characteristics of Eastern culture lie in benevolence, righteousness, and morality. Eastern countries value propriety and righteousness, so they are called lands of propriety and righteousness. When I was a young student in Japan, I greatly admired the Japanese people's respect for propriety and righteousness and their spirit of amity and humility. I believed that the success of Japan's nation-building lay in this point. Later, I aspired to revolution in order to restore our country's inherent spirit and status and to strive to promote Eastern culture. I also remember that when I resided in Japan in 1928, I met Viscount Shibusawa, a titan of the Japanese business community. Viscount Shibusawa personally gave me a specially proofread copy of the Analects and specially pointed out the two sentences, 'Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire,' saying that he had always adhered to these two maxims throughout his life and often reminded Japanese youth, believing that this was the characteristic of our Eastern spirit. At the same time, he kindly told me that he hoped to work together to promote Eastern culture. Unfortunately, Viscount Shibusawa has now passed away, but his words have left me with deep gratitude and memories that I cannot forget to this day. Today, seeing you veteran pioneers of the business community is like seeing Viscount Shibusawa, so I have brought up the old topic again. Now, please stand up and silently pay tribute to the late Viscount Shibusawa." (The hosts and guests all stood up and observed a moment of silence for one minute.) "Today's reception for you is very simple. In terms of formality, we have not expressed a grand ceremony, and we do not have many ideas to offer you. We are simply acting out of the affectionate feelings of fellow Orientals to present a very simple sentence to you, the highly respected senior members of the business community of our neighboring country, and that sentence is, 'Benevolence and affinity as treasure.' I believe you have long understood its meaning. Only benevolence and affinity can sustain human emotions and drive the progress of civilization. This is especially important for our Eastern nations. I hope that the economic and business communities of China and Japan, as well as the people of both countries, will all work together on the point of being close to the benevolent and friendly to our neighbors. I respectfully wish Chairman Kodama and everyone good health." After President Chiang finished his speech, Chairman Kodama stood up and said, "I deeply agree with the meaning of what President Chiang said. Although we dare not compare ourselves to Mr. Shibusawa, we will continue to uphold Mr. Shibusawa's legacy and continue to strive to clarify the relationship between our two countries. President Chiang has taken the time out of his busy schedule to come and teach us and has bestowed tea and refreshments upon us. I would like to express my gratitude to President Chiang on behalf of my colleagues on this trip," and so on. The hosts and guests parted in joy at 5:00 PM. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Nanjing] The Japanese Economic Inspection Group of 25 people visited the capital city's scenery and various scenic spots on the morning of the 16th. At 12:30 PM, all the group members went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to attend a banquet hosted by Foreign Minister Wang. Wang also invited Japanese officials below Ambassador Kawagoe to attend, accompanied by the heads of various ministries and commissions in Nanjing. During the banquet, Foreign Minister Wang rose to give a speech, briefly stating that there was a memorable event in the Sino-Japanese economic circles the year before last, namely that leaders of the Chinese business community, wanting to make Sino-Japanese economic relations more closely intertwined, had organized an inspection group to visit Japan. After the inspection group arrived in Japan, they were fortunate to receive hospitality and various conveniences from all sectors of Japan, and they also frankly exchanged opinions with business tycoons and important government personnel. Although the seeds they sowed have not yet blossomed and borne fruit, the expectations and enthusiasm of sowing those seeds have left a deep impression. This year, the Sino-Japanese Trade Association is holding its first members' conference in China, and leaders of the Japanese business community have come from afar to participate, their purpose also being to discuss how to develop economic relations between China and Japan. This reflects the visit to Japan by the Chinese economic inspection group, and this is of course a commendable and memorable event in the Sino-Japanese economic circles. People from all walks of life in China warmly welcome the gentlemen who have come to China this time, and the Chinese government also feels extremely delighted and expresses the same warm welcome. Since China and Japan are neighboring countries geographically, are of the same race ethnically, and have similar customs and habits culturally, and share the same written language, all relations between the two countries should be especially close and especially sincere. This should be a natural phenomenon. The people of both countries should regard it as a matter of course. In terms of economics, Sino-Japanese commerce should have flourished long ago and made rapid progress. The business communities of both countries should have obtained mutual and equal benefits long ago. The Sino-Japanese Trade Association and the Japan-China Trade Association should have been established firmly long ago and become the general engines for mutual trade. The reason why this kind of good phenomenon has not yet been fully achieved is that there are spiritual obstacles between the people of the two countries. If these obstacles can be removed, then all the natural phenomena that should exist between China and Japan in terms of material things can naturally move forward like a boat sailing with the current and reach the state we hope for. I deeply believe that the gentlemen who have come to China from Japan this time have the greatest enthusiasm to observe everything with a long-term vision and to frankly and sincerely exchange mutually beneficial opinions with all parties related to our country. The success of your efforts will not only be of great benefit to the economic undertakings of the two countries but will also create a new era for the general relations between the two countries. The expectations of you and us are also the expectations of the entire people of China and Japan, and they are also related to the happiness of the future generations of China and Japan. Now, I respectfully raise my glass to wish Ambassador Kawagoe and all the gentlemen good health and to wish Mr. Kodama and other Japanese friends who have come to China together a successful trip. Next, Kawagoe delivered a reply, briefly saying that the Japanese economic community gentlemen's visit to China this time was warmly received by the various institutions and heads of Nanjing, and he was very grateful for Foreign Minister Wang's grand banquet reception. He just continued what Foreign Minister Wang said that China and Japan should have close cooperation and close friendship in various relations, but until now, this goal has not been achieved, which shows that there are still many obstacles and barriers between the two countries, which still need to be removed by the efforts of both governments and the public. When the Chinese economic inspection group went to Japan the year before last, it initiated the Sino-Japanese Trade Association and planted seeds of friendship. According to Minister Wu last night, the climate has become increasingly worse since then, and the seeds have not grown. However, I believe that this seed is still in the ground and has not withered. It is still possible to find ways to make it grow. I believe that if seeds are planted during a good climate, they can be expected to develop quickly, but they are often weak and easily destroyed. If they are planted during a bad climate, although they have to go through various difficulties and obstacles, they will definitely be very strong after they grow up. Therefore, although the Sino-Japanese Trade Association has gone through difficult weather, its future development is infinitely hopeful, and it must achieve good results. Next, Chairman Kodama rose to deliver a reply, briefly stating that although the relationship between China and Japan today does not seem to have reached a good state, we businessmen should not express too much about the general trend of relations between countries. Fortunately, Foreign Minister Wang and Ambassador Kawagoe have given us very clear guidance. We should stand on the position of businessmen and do our best to improve the future Sino-Japanese economy. Although the Sino-Japanese Trade Association seems to have only planted seeds in the past and has not yet developed, it will definitely bloom and bear fruit in the future, without a doubt. We will leave Beijing for Shanghai tomorrow to prepare for the opening of the conference. It is expected that the colleagues from both China and Japan will be able to frankly and directly exchange opinions at this conference and jointly plan for good results. After the speech, the meeting adjourned. At 4:00 PM, they went to the Lixingshe to attend Chairman Chiang's tea party. According to Kodama, he told reporters that the reports in the newspaper a few days ago that the Japanese side had already agreed on ten proposals for the Sino-Japanese Trade Association conference were completely unfounded. As for the report that members of this association had suggested to the Japanese authorities that they hand over 9 million yuan of silver deposited in Japanese banks in Shanghai to China, it depends on how the members proceed. It is not convenient to express an opinion at this time. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)

Current Commentary

### The Italian Prime Minister's Trip to North Africa and Britain

— Supplementary

The conflict of interests between Britain and Italy in the Mediterranean and Africa reached its peak during the East African War. However, it gradually eased after the League of Nations lifted sanctions against Italy. After the signing of the Mediterranean Gentlemen's Agreement in January of this year, relations between the two countries began to return to normal. All past disputes and frictions seemed to have completely disappeared. However, it can be seen that this situation can only be maintained for a short period of time, because the conflict of interests between imperialist countries cannot be fundamentally resolved. Therefore, not long after the conclusion of the Anglo-Italian Agreement, Italy transported a large number of troops to Spain to fight, in an attempt to change the status quo in the western Mediterranean. This was naturally a major blow to Britain, which held the opinion of settling matters peacefully. However, the aggressive ambitions of the Fascists did not stop there. Therefore, recently, the Blackshirt Prime Minister made a trip to North Africa, and there he announced the Fascist colonial policy. These are all actions that further challenge Britain and other colonial empires.

The Blackshirt Prime Minister's trip to North Africa was ostensibly to attend the inauguration ceremony of the highway, but in reality it was to inspect Italy's preparations to challenge Britain. The Italian colony of Libya has undergone great development in the past ten years under the rule of Governors De Bono and Balbo. The recently opened 1,900-kilometer-long coastal motor road is of great military significance. The newly built base of Tobruk (Tobrcrcb) on the northeast coast occupies an important position in the Mediterranean strategy. Because from Tobruk to the northeast, it can connect with the island of Rhodes (Rbodas), and to the northwest, it can maintain close relations with the Pantelleria (paotclleria) base. This is truly the most important section of Italy's Mediterranean lifeline. The Blackshirt Prime Minister's trip to North Africa was also to inspect Italy's military preparations in this area, in order to continue to develop the Fascist forces in Africa.

Although Mussolini's trip contained the meaning of demonstrating to Britain, it was not very obvious. However, his recently announced "Italian Policy towards Muslims" is clearly a challenge to Britain and other colonial powers. In the pamphlet he published, Mr. Mussolini called himself "the sole protector of Muslims and Arabs," and said that among the Muslim countries in the Mediterranean, only Libya enjoys peace. Other places such as Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Palestine, which are under the rule of Britain and France, are frequently disturbed. Mussolini's boasting contains important significance. Because he regards himself as "the sole protector of Muslims and Arabs," Italy will annex all lands inhabited by co-religionists and Arabs and turn them into its own colonies. The scale of his ambition is truly astonishing. According to statistics, there are no less than 209 million Muslims in the world, and the land they inhabit is very vast. According to Mr. Mussolini's words, Italy would have to become the world's first major colonial empire. In fact, among the 44 million Muslims in Africa, only 500,000 are under Italian rule and "protection," while 30 million are under British rule and 9 million under French rule. Now Mr. Mussolini claims to be the "protector of Muslims and Arabs." If this is not an expression of Mussolini's megalomania, then it must be that he has harbored the ambition to seize the entire Africa.

Mussolini's actions are on the one hand a manifestation of Fascist Italy's outward expansion policy, and on the other hand an attempt to deliberately demonstrate to Britain and make it show a concessionary attitude in the negotiations on general European issues. Italy's use of this method has been very successful in the past. The outcome of this time depends on whether Britain will continue to adopt a retreating attitude.

### Negotiations on the Western European Pact Will Proceed Further

But There Is No Hope of Early Success; Belgium's Status Must Be Resolved First

[Paris] Italian Ambassador to France Cerruti recently visited Foreign Minister Daladier and handed him a copy of the Italian government's reply to the British government regarding the Western European Pact. (Havas Dispatch, 15th)

Brussels: The German Ambassador to Belgium recently sent a copy of the German government's memorandum to Britain regarding the Western European Pact to the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Official sources do not wish to comment on this memorandum, but general observers believe that this document has not added any new factors to the international situation. (Havas Dispatch, 15th)

[Paris] Generally, it is believed that after Germany and Italy have submitted their replies, the French officialdom must believe that the door to further negotiations has been opened, but it is not believed that this new pact has any hope of early success. It is said that Daladier once warned the Russian Ambassador that France must abide by its international obligations, and it is believed that the Belgian Ambassador will make the same statement, and Belgium will continue to faithfully adhere to the League of Nations. (National Dispatch, 16th)

[London] Regarding the Western European Pact, the Italian government's reply to the two notes from Britain has been delivered here. According to sources from responsible parties, this reply fundamentally expresses disagreement with the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, believing that it conflicts with the 1925 Locarno Pact, and strongly advocates abolishing the mechanical automatic mutual assistance clauses in the pact. If there is any situation where it is necessary to designate an "aggressor," then the two guaranteeing countries, Britain and Italy, should be responsible for the ruling. This is the same as the German attitude. - General observers believe that these demands of Germany and Italy are inevitably excessive, especially Italy. Italy once used force to annex Abyssinia. How can it be allowed to be responsible for determining the aggressor? Observers also believe that Britain has long been determined to base its foreign policy on the principles contained in the League of Nations Covenant, so it cannot consider the methods proposed in the replies from Italy and Germany this time. Moreover, the notes from Italy and Germany clearly advocate restoring the Four-Power Pact of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy in 1933, which runs counter to the current trend of British foreign policy. In addition, responsible parties believe that the current negotiations on the conclusion of the Western European Pact are roughly concentrated on the point of Belgium's neutral status. Judging from the attitudes expressed in the replies from Germany and Italy, only the issue of Belgium's neutral status can be resolved at present. This issue should be quickly compromised by Britain, France, and Germany to jointly guarantee Belgium's security, and Belgium does not need to be a guaranteeing country at the same time. Moreover, this matter should be resolved quickly, otherwise Belgium may try to conclude an agreement with Germany alone to obtain Germany's guarantee. If so, Germany's position will be strengthened, and the position of Britain and France will inevitably be weakened. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 15th)

### Arbitrary Remarks by Japanese Military Personnel Stationed in China Are Useless

Matsumura of the House of Peers Raises Questions and Secretly Discusses the Suiyuan Issue to Eliminate the Superordinate Status of the Kwantung Army

[Tokyo] The House of Peers held a meeting this morning and had a fierce debate on the arbitrary remarks made by Japanese military personnel stationed in China and the Suiyuan issue. Giichi Matsumura questioned the Minister of the Army, pointing out that Japanese military agencies stationed in China often issued diplomatic statements to China, especially in the past two years. He said that even judging from common sense, such actions are harmful. A few days ago, Army Minister Sugiyama replied to questions from members of the House of Peers, stating that he would again issue a statement regarding the Tanggu Agreement. It is best not to issue this statement. At this point, Matsumura mentioned the declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on November 22nd of last year, stating that Japan had nothing to do with the Suiyuan incident. At the same time, the Kwantung Army stated on December 28th of last year that the Suiyuan incident was an action of the Mongolian army, but if it endangered Manchuria, the Kwantung Army would take resolute action, etc. Matsumura said that the above two statements are extremely contradictory. Will the Minister of the Army warn the Kwantung Army?

Army Minister Sugiyama, in his capacity as President of the Manchurian Affairs Bureau, replied that when events related to the North China Military Agreement occur, it is indeed necessary for the Japanese military stationed in China to issue a statement. However, it is wrong to regard the opinions issued by some officers as the opinions of the Army authorities, especially in the past two years, because violations of the Military Agreement occurred one after another, so the statements also increased accordingly. This kind of behavior is not useless, and this policy will continue to be adopted. The Minister of the Army continued to defend the actions of the Kwantung Army, denied that the statements of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Kwantung Army were contradictory, and said that when an incident occurred near its capital, the Kwantung Army could not remain silent. I do not intend to warn them.

Matsumura spoke again, expressing dissatisfaction with the Minister of the Army's reply, and believed that it was completely incorrect, saying that the Military Agreement should be made public as much as possible so that everyone would know. Many newspapers' news about North China was not fabricated by reporters themselves, but was issued by local Japanese officers. Such arbitrary statements are not allowed in diplomacy. Regarding the Suiyuan issue, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs listened clearly that it had nothing to do with Japan, while the Kwantung Army said that it did. Isn't this contradictory? What is not contradictory?

At this time, the debate was very intense. Another member, Baron Iwaya, stood up and requested that the debate be changed to a closed meeting so that they could exchange opinions calmly. However, the Minister of the Army did not flinch and replied that if any event is directly related to the commander of the Army, the commander of the Army can issue a statement, but if there is a major event, he must obtain the consent of the diplomatic authorities or the central government. As for the outside world's perception that the Kwantung Army stands in a superordinate position, attention should be paid to eliminating this impression in the future. The Minister of the Army then explained the Suiyuan incident in detail, but did not make it public. Finally, Matsumura warned that when the issue of reducing anti-Japanese sentiment occurs, it must also be handled through diplomatic channels. Regarding the Military Agreement, there must be thorough discussions with the diplomatic authorities. I very much hope that the Minister of the Army will continue to work hard to further tighten military discipline. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 16th)

### British House of Commons Discusses Japanese Smuggling and Drug Trafficking

Smuggling Decreases Slightly, Drug Trafficking Remains: British Government Constantly Informed

[London] Today's House of Commons discussions were almost entirely focused on issues concerning China and Japan. Members of Parliament raised questions regarding smuggling in North China, the Keelung incident in Taiwan, Japanese citizens' involvement in drug trafficking in China, and the issue of Japanese perpetual leaseholds. Initially, Conservative MP Moore requested an overview of the smuggling situation in North China. Under-Secretary Cranborne responded that, according to recent figures, the quantity and value of smuggled goods were gradually decreasing. Moore urged the assembly to note recent reports stating that, in the past three months, Japanese individuals had protected 1,500 loaded vehicles carrying smuggled goods passing through Chinese customs. Cranborne replied that the government was deeply concerned about smuggling, but the quantity and value had decreased. Moore then mentioned China's mortgage debt. Cranborne stated that he was awaiting a report from Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen.

Subsequently, Labour MP Fletcher raised the issue of drug smuggling in China. Under-Secretary Cranborne stated that British consulate staff in China and other officials were regularly providing information about Japanese citizens smuggling drugs into China. This information was immediately sent to the British representative on the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee, who would take effective and necessary measures. Whether or not the information would be made public was a matter for international decision. As far as he knew, the proceedings and reports of the committee's meetings had been published regularly. Fletcher responded that recent reports indicated that Japanese authorities were actively encouraging Japanese citizens to transport and sell drugs. Cranborne replied that the British government was considering the entire issue.

Conservative MP Cayser then asked whether a resolution had been reached regarding the cancellation of perpetual leasehold rights held by British citizens in Japanese treaty ports, following the British Ambassador Clive's presentation of a counter-proposal to the Japanese government, and whether the British leaseholders' committee would consider it a satisfactory solution. Cranborne stated that a solution had been reached in accordance with the counter-proposal presented by the British Ambassador, and that the British Ambassador and the Japanese Foreign Minister would soon exchange documents on the matter.

Regarding the Keelung incident, Under-Secretary Sir Charles stated that the case had not yet been resolved. The Keelung incident occurred on October 7th of last year, and it was said that three British sailors and one British officer had been insulted in Keelung, Taiwan. However, the British Ambassador to Japan and the Japanese Foreign Minister were actively discussing the matter. (Central News Agency, 15th, Reuters)

### Anglo-Russian Peace and Friendship Congress

Speeches by Many Celebrities

[London] At the Anglo-Russian Peace and Friendship Congress on the 13th, the renowned Soviet writer Alexei Tolstoy attended and delivered a speech, which was very well received. Tolstoy arrived at the venue with Soviet Ambassador Maisky and British writer H.G. Wells. Tolstoy spoke in Russian, which was translated into English, and was frequently interrupted by applause. In particular, when Tolstoy said that there were no books glorifying war in the Soviet Union, the entire audience erupted in thunderous applause. The Archbishop of Canterbury stated in his speech that the greatest revolution in human life had been realized in the Soviet Union, which made him extremely interested in the country. He also said that the Soviet Union's economic freedom and the social control of industry amazed the world. The Soviet Union was the only country where unemployment had been eliminated, the only country that truly protected women, and the only country where children were educated. The Soviet Union was a multi-ethnic country, based on the harmony of the people, which particularly attracted his attention. Subsequently, Griffiths, a theater critic from The Observer, spoke about the situation in the Soviet theater world. Professor Constable discussed Soviet art. Sir Palles spoke about Soviet public education. Cole, a representative from Oxford University and an economist, reported on the Soviet planned economy. Reeves, a representative of the cooperative movement, pointed out the position of Soviet cooperatives in the socialist plan. John Strachey then discussed the case of the Anti-Soviet Trotskyist Center in Moscow. Strachey's explanation was endorsed by the entire audience. All representatives expressed their sympathy for the Soviet government's struggle against the Trotskyists. Next, a representative from the Quaker Church stood up and stated that the church had sent him to attend because the Soviet Union did not harbor aggressive intentions towards other countries. Because the Soviet Union had established socialist justice domestically, the Soviet Union had discovered better ways to solve human problems than war. A representative from New Zealand spoke, saying that his country had also heard about the work being carried out in the Soviet Union. New Zealand and Australia feared a major war in the Pacific and knew that the Soviet Union was an important factor for peace. The representative of Indian students who spoke next said that oppressed nations naturally gravitated towards the Soviet Union. According to the report of the Credentials Committee of the Congress, the groups represented at this session had a total membership of 2,834,000, which was double the number of the first Congress last year. The final session of the Congress resolved to establish a permanent Anglo-Soviet Peace and Friendship Committee. The tasks of the committee included organizing similar congresses and committees in various provinces, publishing accurate information about the Soviet Union, and sending representatives to the Soviet Union for investigation. The Congress finally resolved that the next Congress should be held before the end of 1938. (15th TASS)

### Soviet Savings Surge

[Moscow] In January of this year, the deposits of workers in Soviet savings banks increased by 91,836,000 rubles, reaching a total of 3,626,000,000 rubles. At the beginning of this year, the total savings in each federal republic had doubled compared to the beginning of 1935. They had even increased by two and a half and three times in Armenia and Georgia. In 1936, the average savings per household increased from 173 to 252 rubles, an average increase of 39% in cities and 50% in rural areas. The reasons for the rapid increase in savings were the sharp rise in income of urban and rural people, and the continuous development of the Stakhanovite movement in industry and railways. Another factor was the significant increase in collective agricultural income and labor productivity. At the beginning of 1936, there were 4,200,000 Soviet worker depositors, with total savings of 713,000,000 rubles, of which more than 400,000 households had savings exceeding 500 rubles.

### British Air Force Budget Passed at £88 Million

More Than £30 Million Increase Over Last Year: Existing Air Force to be Expanded Threefold

[London] British Under-Secretary of State for Air Sir Philip Sassoon presented the Air Force estimates in the House of Commons today, stipulating that the British Air Force be expanded threefold from its current strength and equipped with the latest equipment. The gross expenditure amounts to £88,588,600, and the net expenditure is £56,500,000, an increase of approximately £22,000,000 compared to the total expenditure in 1936. Sir Philip Sassoon explained that we are convinced that a well-equipped and readily available strong British Air Force is one of Britain's best contributions to world peace. Britain's expansion of the Air Force does not mean abandoning the hope of establishing an Air Force Convention and general stability of air armaments. The British government has not only not abandoned this hope, but also believes that the realization of this hope is an extremely important event. If there is an opportunity, it will be used to promote its realization. The current expansion of the Air Force is not only a matter of making up for deficiencies, but also of increasing the Air Force threefold and equipping it with the latest equipment. The manufacturing of aircraft and engines has now gained experience, and new factories have already started construction, so the output of aircraft and engines will definitely be rapid in the future. However, the training of truly skilled drivers and pilots will take time. What can be reported to the House of Commons now is that the supply of talent is very satisfactory. The government plans to train 1,175 pilots this year and is currently engaged in recruitment. The government is now cooperating with the Dominions to train pilots and fill the officer ranks of the Australian Air Force. After the training is completed, they will first serve in the UK for several years before being transferred to the Australian Air Force. New Zealand also has this method and plans to establish a system for examining the physical health of those who apply to the Air Force locally. If Canada also adopts this training, the British government will be very happy to welcome it, because Canada already has hundreds of young people who voluntarily come to the UK for short-term service. Sir Philip Sassoon then spoke of the satisfactory progress of airfield construction and other projects, and then spoke of the issue of producing sufficient grain and supplies. He said that, with the exception of the largest naval aircraft, all biplanes have now been completely replaced by monoplanes, because monoplanes have now reached a perfect form. It used to be quite difficult to obtain sufficiently rigid wings to resist bending, so for many years, it was not possible to quickly switch to monoplanes. Now, this difficulty has been overcome. Continuous attention is paid to all aspects of manufacturing, so the power of new aircraft is very different from that of the same aircraft two years ago. However, the British government is by no means complacent about this and is actively researching every day in order to obtain aircraft with greater speed, longer range, and greater load capacity. Sir Philip Sassoon then described other aspects of progress, saying that two new cannons are now used in aircraft, one is a completely new type of Vickers cannon, and the other is a Browning cannon that is simple to operate and more effective. The government is now trying to manufacture them in the UK. The time required for mass production of new aircraft is less than half of what it used to be. In 1935, the UK built 53 squadrons of domestic aircraft, but now, 124 squadrons can be obtained in a few months. Factories for manufacturing airframes and engines are being established one after another, and progress is good. The government is now giving serious consideration to the need for raw materials to prevent the danger of a shortage of raw materials in wartime, so it has taken measures to hoard several kinds of necessary raw materials in preparation for unforeseen circumstances. Petroleum and other materials have now been procured and stored in places that are not easily attacked by air raids. Sir Philip Sassoon stated the progress of British civil aviation, saying that after the beginning of 1938, the British Imperial Airmail Plan should be fully realized. The total cost for all first-class mail passing through the Imperial air routes from the UK to various parts of the Empire will be one and a half pence per half ounce. He hoped that the South Africa Durban route could be opened in the early summer of this year, and the Singapore route could also be expected to be operational this year. At that time, there will be three weekly mail flights to Kisumu in Africa, two of which will be transferred to Durban, and three weekly flights to Singapore, two of which will be transferred to Sydney. As for flights to Egypt, there will be approximately three weekly flights, two of which will be transferred to India. Therefore, there will be five weekly airmail services from the UK to India in the future. Fuel supply facilities for each route are currently being arranged. As for the North Atlantic aviation business, the government is currently handling matters such as the bases for seaplanes and land planes. There are three main routes across the Atlantic that are currently under consideration. Before the end of the year, or use the four-engine high-speed land plane that is about to be built to make experimental flights. By 1938, the UK should have several specially-built airships. The possibility of long-range airships is currently being studied. As for long-distance training flights, they have already begun. In 1936, the new foreign aviation industries that the UK had already opened included weekly mail flights between Khartoum and Kano, and temporary air services between Penang and Hong Kong.

[London] The House of Commons discussed the Air Force budget yesterday afternoon and held two votes. The first time, the opposition Labour Party's motion was rejected by 175 votes to 119 votes. The second time, the government's proposed budget was passed by 210 votes to 94 votes. During the discussion, opposition Labour Party member Montague fiercely attacked the government's foreign policy, especially its attitude towards Germany's request to restore its former colonies. He said, "Germany is now using a clever strategy, that is, an economic invasion of the old colonies, attempting to recover them and put an accomplished fact before the UK." Liberal Party member Shelley then spoke, expressing his support for the government's policy of expanding armaments, but said that the continued flight power of bombers was limited, and the anti-fog equipment of various aircraft was also insufficient. Later, he mentioned the balloons used by the Air Force, saying that the ascent height of French balloons could reach eight kilometers, while those of the UK only reached three kilometers, which was really inferior. Conservative Party member Wells declared that he hoped that the Imperial Conference in May this year would be able to study an issue, that is, whether the various parts of the British Empire could follow the current practices of Germany and the United States and use Zeppelin-style airships to run scheduled aviation. At this point, opposition Labour Party member Massey proposed a motion, "Future air wars are enough to endanger human culture to a great extent. This House should request the government to use its full strength to promote the abolition of all naval and air force aircraft by various countries and place civil aviation under international management." Under-Secretary of State for Air Sir Philip Sassoon answered in the name of the government, saying that among the countries of the world, the UK was the earliest to promote disarmament conferences. As for the proposal to unify the civil aviation of various countries under international management, there were various difficulties in its implementation. Once this method was implemented, the main air routes between the various parts of the British Empire would not be managed by the UK, and the air routes between France and Italy's headquarters and various colonies would also be transferred to international management, which was not easy. As a result of the discussion, the House of Commons finally rejected the Labour Party's motion and passed the Air Force budget. (Central News Agency, 16th, Havas)

### American Jews Hold Anti-German Congress

Approximately 24,000 Participants: New York Mayor Ridicules Hitler Again

[New York] The American Jewish Congress and the Jewish Labor Committee held a public rally in Madison Square Park today, attended by approximately 20,000 people. 300 police officers were present to maintain order. The congress passed a resolution advocating spiritual and economic rejection of Germany. Chairman of the American Jewish Congress Wise gave the opening speech, stating that he only opposed Hitler's political philosophy, not the German people. Former Director of the US Reconstruction Administration Johnson delivered a speech, saying that Hitler's mouthpiece newspaper had retorted against the New York Mayor's speech, like a box of poisonous snakes, blindly devouring people. He also said that the National Socialist Party was secretly training stormtroopers in the US, with approximately 10,000 people, and had established youth camps, attempting to politicize American youth and form boy scouts. Johnson pointed out that Hitler was good at lying and was a scourge to world peace, saying that it would be strange not to sign treaties with Communist Russia, Imperialist Japan, Fascist Italy, and National Socialist Germany. Who can trust the peace treaties they sign? Leader of the Committee for Industrial Organization Lewis told the audience that many German trade union leaders had been beaten to death. The masses at the congress finally requested New York Mayor LaGuardia to deliver a speech. The mayor replied, "I don't know what kind of protests today's meeting will cause. I am not worried about what Hitler will say. Hitler is not a good person to deal with in personal diplomacy." (15th National Telegram)

[New York] The American Jewish Congress recently held a grand gathering in Madison Square Park today to express its opposition to German National Socialism. The number of participants totaled 24,000. No fewer than 240,000 people were unable to enter due to the small venue. These people were all listening to speeches in front of wireless radio broadcast machines in nearby thoroughfares. After the meeting began, Director of the Federal Public Works Bureau, that is, former Director of the Reconstruction Bureau, Johnson, first delivered a speech, pointing out that National Socialism was enough to cause various dangers. Chairman of the Industrial Improvement Association Lewis then spoke, criticizing the wage policy implemented in Germany, saying, "German workers earn less than two US dollars per week, accounting for one-third of the total." The congress then immediately passed a resolution, "The American people should refuse to provide financial assistance to Germany in order to prevent its perverse behavior. We should actively boycott its goods and various services in order to peacefully preserve the American democratic system and save the German people from being destroyed by National Socialism." (Central News Agency, 15th, Havas)

[New York] New York City Mayor LaGuardia recently delivered a speech at the American Jewish Congress, saying that German First Leader Hitler should still be considered "the madman in a brown shirt." "You don't have to worry about how Hitler will react. As far as worldwide discussion is concerned, Hitler's personality and his diplomatic actions are both "unacceptable." As for how to explain the word "unacceptable," LaGuardia refused to explain. Many people listening to the side of the podium believed that the deep meaning of this word was "where honor lies, Hitler has no way to intervene." (Central News Agency, 15th, Havas)

### Withdrawal of Volunteer Soldiers Within Spain

Committee Continues Discussion

[London] The subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee for the Spanish Civil War met this afternoon to discuss the issue of payment of expenses by countries participating in the monitoring plan. The first batch of expenses shared by various countries has been paid, of which only the Polish representative agreed to allocate £1,000. After being urged by the chairman, he requested his government to pay a certain amount in addition. The subcommittee is now scheduled to continue its meeting tomorrow morning to discuss the issue of preventing indirect intervention in the civil war, such as providing financial resources, sending propaganda personnel, and the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers from various countries. The nature of this discussion is quite important. In addition, it is rumored that Soviet Ambassador to the UK Maisky has sent an official letter to Chairman of the Adjustment Committee Lord Plymouth, stating that the Soviet Union firmly refused to discuss the issue of "neutralizing" the Spanish Republican government's gold deposits abroad. In general, it is feared that the Soviet Union's attitude will cause major difficulties when the subcommittee meets tomorrow, or even affect the monitoring plan that has already been established.

### Spanish Ambassador Appeals to the US

Pay Attention to Foreign Troops Invading: Endangering World Peace

[Washington] Spanish Ambassador to the US Lorio sent a note to the State Department today, requesting the US government to pay attention to the situation of a large number of foreign troops invading Spain, calling these troops "public enemies of world peace." However, the US does not currently intend to convene a world peace conference or initiate disarmament. It is likely that it will be necessary to see if members of Congress demand that President Roosevelt take action. (15th National Telegram)

[Washington] The wording of the memorandum is the same as that submitted by Spanish Foreign Minister Valentín to the League of Nations Secretariat. However, the Spanish Ambassador also stated in the memorandum, "Spain makes a conscience appeal to the world, especially in the United States, because the United States is the site of the Kellogg-Briand Pact." (Central News Agency, 16th, Reuters)

⊙ Hengtai Today received an unchecked telegram from the Spanish border stating that the commander-in-chief of the government army's Madrid front, Miaja, personally led an international team and cut off the retreat of a large Italian army in a certain place, and seized 500 military vehicles and a train of military supplies. (16th National Telegram)

[London] The House of Commons met this afternoon. Several members of the opposition Labour Party and Liberal Party questioned Italy's assistance to the Spanish Nationalist Army. Labour Party members Fletcher and Wilkinson said that there were as many as 100,000 Italians helping the Spanish Nationalist Army in combat. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Cranborne answered on behalf of the government that since the implementation of the ban on volunteer soldiers joining Spain, the British government has not known of any foreign volunteer soldiers going there. This point has been explained by Foreign Secretary Eden. The subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee is currently studying the issue of the withdrawal of foreign volunteer soldiers within Spain. (15th Havas)

[Paris] After the Spanish government recently revealed to the League of Nations that the Italian regular army was assisting the Nationalist Army, the Socialist Party organ newspaper Le Populaire reported that the French government had alerted the Italian government to the seriousness of this matter.

### German Finance May Be Safe

Schacht's Speech: Management and Utilization

[Berlin] President of the German National Bank Dr. Schacht delivered a speech at the board meeting of the bank this morning, saying that the secret of the source of funds for Germany's creative work, national defense construction, and other great plans is nothing more than the implementation of strict fiscal discipline. Even if the entire source of funds is unusually difficult, it can be greatly successful if it can be properly managed and utilized. Schacht continued, saying that Germany's current fiscal downturn was really caused by wartime currency inflation, reparations, and the mismanagement of the past, which greatly affected Germany's fiscal foundation and economic system. He assured the audience that Germany was definitely not worried about fiscal dangers today, because the fiscal policy currently being implemented is a strict management method, and German banks have thoroughly studied various situations and are constantly paying attention to the results of their credit policy. If special circumstances are encountered, necessary steps will be taken to deal with them. Schacht solemnly stated that the elasticity of German banks definitely does not conflict with basic fiscal principles. Germany's current fiscal policy is seamlessly connected with credit policy, and its purpose is to establish a healthy relationship between currency and goods. The "mystery" of German fiscal policy is nothing more than ensuring that the national bank pays to general industry, commerce, and the economic system, all of which are returned to the bank as the original amount. This kind of turnover will be difficult to clear in the future due to long-term or short-term loans, but German banks will deal with this problem with the greatest determination and responsibility.

### The Nazi Party's Influence in Danzig is Growing Daily

Members Increase to Forty-Six

⊙Danzig: Danzig was originally a free city under the protection of the League of Nations according to the Treaty of Versailles. However, the German Nazi Party members in the city, with the aim of completely taking over the administration of the city, have now made considerable progress. Since three opposition members resigned from the Danzig parliament, their successors have now declared their belief in Nazism. Therefore, there are now a total of seventy-two members in the Danzig parliament, and Nazi Party members account for forty-six of them. Furthermore, it is noted that amendments to the Danzig constitution must be passed by a two-thirds majority. The number of seats held by the Nazi Party is only one seat short of this majority.

### Hu Baoshan's Unit of the Pseudo-Mongolian Army in Chahar North Suddenly Mutinies

Wu Heling has returned to West Banner from Changchun. Li Shouxin's unit will move to West Kaijiabu Temple.

Zhangbei Dispatch: Since the reorganization of the pseudo-army in Chahar North into one army and one division, each has been intensifying training in their respective defense areas. However, judging from the situation of their recent movements and transportation, there seems to be a trend towards more aggressive actions. A certain party has always used deceptive tactics to instigate banditry and treachery. Therefore, the situation is sometimes dull and sometimes tense. However, their ultimate goal remains unclear at this time. According to recent information, De Wang sent his confidant Wu Heling to Changchun earlier this month as a representative to discuss the issue of strengthening the puppet organization with a certain military department. After Wu arrived in Changchun, it happened that the chief of staff of that military department was being newly transferred, so Wu stayed in Changchun. On the twelfth of this month, Wu finally returned to Jiabu Temple from Changchun by plane. At that time, De Wang had already gone to West Suminte Banner for his mother's memorial ceremony. After Wu disembarked, he learned of this news from the greeters and immediately took the original plane to West Banner. Judging from his hurried appearance, there must be a significant meaning to strengthening the puppet organization, so he urgently needed to report to De Wang.

According to Kangbao news, on the night of the twelfth of this month, more than a hundred soldiers from the independent regiment of the pseudo-Mongolian army under Hu Doushan suddenly mutinied, carrying weapons and fleeing eastward. The reason for the mutiny is that a certain party believed that Hu's unit was unstable and feared that it would lead to a major change if it brewed for too long. Therefore, Hu was ordered to implement a downsizing and planned to take the opportunity to disarm and dismiss the unit. Unexpectedly, Hu's subordinates learned of this before it could be implemented, so they mutinied in advance. All the newly issued firearms were taken away. Hu Baoshan also knew that his subordinates were wavering, and because it was at night, he did not give chase, so he allowed them to escape calmly.

The former Li Shouxin's Yin Baoshan Division is mostly stationed in Shangdu, with another three hundred or so soldiers stationed in Baochang. Recently, there has also been news of preparations to move westward to Huade. The pseudo-Fifth Division of Yi Xiaoxian was originally stationed in Baochang and Guyuan and has now concentrated in Dolun, jointly defending with the pseudo-Eighth Division of Bao Yueqing. Currently, Jiabu Temple and Dolun have become the military and political centers of a certain party. (13th)

### Liu Weizhi Discusses Guangdong Province's Economic Construction Plans

Increasing Production and Creating Factories; Provincial Industries Actively Improving

Guangzhou Dispatch: Liu Weizhi, the Guangdong Construction Director, went to Beijing some time ago to attend the Third Plenary Session and discuss the progress of various construction plans in Guangdong Province. He has since returned to Guangdong in recent days. From now on, Liu will surely have new plans for construction measures. According to Liu's statement, which is very detailed, a brief record is as follows:

Industrial Construction Plan

Regarding the development of industry in Guangdong Province, efforts should be concentrated on basic industries, and those related to national defense should also be earnestly addressed. Particular attention should be paid to continuing previous factory contracts (such as steel plants, etc.) so that actual work can begin in the short term. Regarding the progress of the steel plant, I have been urging the British Bali Bao Company to submit the final technical report to the government for review and implementation, and at the same time, I am trying to raise funds to fulfill the payment obligations.

Promoting Agricultural Production

A large-scale fertilizer factory is currently being rebuilt. The output of the new factory will be at least 50,000 tons per year, making it comparable to the existing Yonghe Sulfuric Acid Factory in Pukou. Agriculture in the interior of Guangdong mostly needs nitrogen fertilizer. According to previous statistics, the maximum annual sales reached 1.6 million dan. In recent years, agricultural production in Guangdong has not been as good as before, so the demand for fertilizer is less than before. If production is reorganized and promoted, the demand for fertilizer will be greater. Not only can the original state be recovered, but it can also exceed the highest sales volume to date. The existing fertilizer factory has an annual output of only 10,000 tons. The total output of the new factory will be no more than 60,000 tons, which is still not enough to supply the needs of Guangdong Province. The raw materials required by the factory, except for machinery purchased from abroad, will all be sourced from within the province. The construction cost of the factory will require approximately HK$10 million to HK$12 million. Regarding the fundraising method, it is a joint venture with foreign merchants. This method has been finalized and will soon be submitted to the provincial government for discussion and implementation.

Providing Low-Cost Power

Guangdong is known as a good agricultural area and also a good industrial area. Therefore, it is necessary to promote agriculture and industry at the same time, so that economic development can be expected. The most needed thing for industrial development is low-cost "motive power" to reduce costs. To obtain low-cost "motive power," hydropower must be used. The government once proposed the construction of a hydropower plant several years ago. If the former method is followed, the government must raise huge sums of money to start the project. The current financial situation is different from before. If everything must have a huge amount of cash, it is impossible. Therefore, we must use people's capital or foreign capital to set it up. Currently, the fundraising method for the factory is also a joint venture with foreign merchants. As for the first step of the plan, it is to re-measure the original site of the Wengjiang Hydropower Plant, and the rainfall should be investigated clearly. If the local rainfall is sufficient, it can be carried out. The power generation of the plant is set at 50,000 to 75,000 kilowatts per year (kilowatts are also known as "Yan'er" as a unit of electricity). The construction funds will require approximately HK$15 million to HK$20 million. If this plan is realized, the entire project can be completed in about three years.

Planning a Rayon Factory

In addition to the above-mentioned basic industries, it is now planned to set up a rayon factory. Although rayon is a consumer industry, it is also closely related to national defense. It is a shame that such a large country as ours does not have a rayon factory. Currently, negotiations are underway with foreign merchants to jointly operate a medium-sized rayon factory with a daily output of at least three tons. The method will use wood pulp as raw material, requiring approximately $4 million, including working capital. This plan is being actively carried out, and it can be published successively in the near future.

Developing the Qiongya Issue

Regarding the development of Hainan Island, Chairman Song (Ziwen) has drafted a comprehensive plan. In addition, there are other methods. All methods are being discussed. The approximate steps are to promote people's own operations on the one hand and borrow foreign capital on the other hand. The two sides will advance together more easily. Chairman Song and President Sun (Ke), who are most concerned and interested in the development of Qiongya, also plan to go south to inspect in the short term. After efforts are made to promote the development in various aspects, the fundamental plan for the development of Qiongya will surely be resolved to a considerable extent.

Organizing Provincial Industries

Regarding the future methods for organizing provincial industries, plans have been drafted repeatedly. Because provincial industries are entirely business entities, we must first find a way to commercialize them so that they can last. The government has expressed its policy on running industries: all factories that are light industries can be run by the people themselves. Even if the provincial factories that are currently being completed, if the people are willing to undertake them, they can be transferred at any time, so that the people have the opportunity to participate fully in industrial construction, which is also a method of promoting national economic construction. In the future, there are two points that should be paid attention to in improving factory methods: ㊀ Carefully select capable, honest, and clean people to be responsible for handling them so that the public has a full understanding of the actual situation of each factory. ㊁ Make the organization of each factory very strict so that malpractices can be prevented in advance. By doing this, the previous misunderstandings can be eliminated.

### Songjiang

Prison Inmates Gamble and Riot

At about 5:00 pm on the 16th, inmates in the county prison gathered to gamble. When the guards discovered this, they strictly forbade it, but the inmates did not comply. As a result, four ringleaders were interrogated, and all the prisoners in the prison started rioting. Later, prison official Lu ordered all the guards to take strict precautions to prevent incidents. At the same time, the ringleaders were sent to the county prosecutor's office for interrogation.

### Taicang

Suddenly Becomes Mute After Defecation

Min Xichen's son, Xihua, a resident of Yiqiao Township in the county's Third District, had an opium addiction. After being ordered to quit by the county government, he continued to smoke after being discharged from the hospital. He was caught by the Fu Bureau and sent to the county hospital for investigation. He was found to be addicted to opium and sentenced to three years in a smoke offender's detention center. At about 9:00 am on the 14th, Min had an urgent need to urinate, coughed and salivated, and at the same time, his lips and tongue were crooked, and he could not speak, suddenly becoming mute. The symptoms are very bizarre.

### Suzhou

Baizhang Gathered for Training in Su

The township Baizhang of the whole county are ordered to be re-elected. The county government ordered all districts to actively handle this matter. The various bureaus have submitted reports to the county government. They are now being reviewed in batches and will be completed this month. The training of the Baizhang of the eight counties in the second district of Jiangsu, Wu County, Changshu, Wuxi, Changzhou, Wujiang, Kunshan, etc., was originally scheduled to begin in Wuxi in April for centralized training. Because Wuxi does not have a suitable location, the commissioner's office specially instructed Wu County Magistrate Deng on the 16th to change the training of the Baizhang of the eight counties to be held in Wu County. Deng County Magistrate, upon receiving the order, believes that the county middle school and the junior high school department of the provincial Suzhou middle school can accommodate more than 2,000 people, which is more suitable. He immediately reported it to the commissioner's office for approval.

### Wuxi

Representatives of the Whole Jiangsu Silk to Shanghai

The Jiangsu Provincial Silk Industry Association of Trade Unions held a meeting in Wuxi some time ago because the Zhejiang silk industry will hold a meeting in Shanghai within days to discuss the improvement of the silk industry in the two provinces. More than 20 representatives from Wuxi, Liyang, Danyang, Yixing, Wujin, Jintan, etc. attended the meeting, chaired by Chen Xiekun. First, he reported on the last time he went to the province to request the construction department to maintain the original silk business, continue to issue posts, and urge each silk business to change to the new-style silkworm drying machine, and request the construction department to designate special funds to promote the common breeding of silkworms, etc. After that, the discussion began. ㊀ Proposals for the joint meeting of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang silk industries: (A) Reorganize the former Shanghai Silk Industry Association; (B) Establish a joint office in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces; (C) Inquire about the cooperation methods in Zhejiang Province. ㊁ Determine that Chen Xiekun, Jiang Daoshan, Ma Yintang, Wei Shixin, Hu Yinjie, Jing Shaopan, Xu Haoran, Cao Shaochen, and Chen Xiaoqing will be the representatives to attend the meeting in Shanghai. ㊂ Determine to convene a general assembly of representatives from all counties on April 20. ㊃ Counties that owe membership fees should quickly pay them off in order to conclude the meeting. The meeting adjourned after the discussion. The representatives had already gone to Shanghai at the appointed time yesterday.

Detaining and Pursuing Grain Households in Arrears

The county's old arrears of land tax over the years have reached millions. The province ordered that it be paid in full in three installments within five months. It also dispatched a commissioner to sit in the county to expedite the collection. The amount collected in the first two installments was very small. The grain households assigned by each Tuzheng were also scattered small households. At that time, the land tax office transferred all the Tuzheng and grain households with the most arrears to the county for detention and pursuit, about more than 100 people. At 11:00 am on the 16th, Li Pingzhen, a grain household in Yanqiaotou, the seventh district, was also detained in the county for arrears of several hundred yuan and repeated urging. At the same time, all the expediting camps were ordered to collect 50% of the amount before the end of April and should not be short of a single point.

### Changzhou

Mediating the Dispute at the Minfeng Factory

The Wuyi County Government convened a conciliation committee on the afternoon of the 15th to mediate the labor dispute at the Minfeng Yarn Factory. The chairman, County Magistrate Hou Houzong, discussed the following items based on the seven conditions proposed by the labor side: ㊀ Request to restore the previously reduced wages and decide that the wage standard should be handled in accordance with the Dacheng Yarn Factory; ㊁ Request to cancel the decision of the training class students to work as temporary supervisors and let the technical managers clarify their responsibilities, carefully adjust, and improve work efficiency. In the future, the factory will select outstanding workers from the existing workers to train the student workers first. The principle of clarifying the responsibilities of the student workers and temporary supervisors will be formulated by the factory in consultation with the Trade Union Federation; ㊂ Decide that workers should not be dismissed without reason; ㊃ Request to reinstate the dismissed temporary supervisors and workers without fault. It was decided that there were no facts and it was not necessary to discuss; ㊄ Request that the workers' wage booklets should indicate the daily wages earned and should be paid daily. It was decided that the factory had already done so and there was no need to discuss; ㊅ Request that the factory should not force workers to teach the student workers. It was decided to do so; ㊆ Request that the training director Chen Yuquan and the old worker of the weaving department Shen Jinsheng be dismissed. It was decided that this was the factory's administration and should be handled by the factory itself.

### Nantong

Promoting Improved Cotton Seeds

The Jiangsu Provincial Cotton Production Improvement Office is currently setting up three cotton cultivation center promotion areas in northern Jiangsu to select and cultivate improved cotton seeds and lend them to cotton farmers, starting from the coastal reclamation area. Nantong Sanyu is allocated 5,000 dan of Deozi cotton seeds, Dongtai Dafeng is allocated 7,200 dan of Jinzi cotton seeds, and Funing Tongda Jichan Office is allocated 3,240 dan of Jinzi cotton seeds.

Continuing to Search and Arrest Opium and Drug Offenders

During the general re-examination of opium and drug offenders in Tongyi, the number of those reported but not yet arrested was very large. The county government ordered all districts to continue searching and arresting them and set a deadline of one month for suspected opium and drug offenders to surrender and be investigated. The District Security Command also burned the seized opium and drug paraphernalia on the 15th.

### Yangzhou

Yangzhou Flour Mill Decides to Stop Production

The Yangzhou Flour Mill outside the Bianyi Gate in Yangzhou, which has its headquarters in Shanghai, has been suspended this year, waiting for the shareholders to meet and decide on a solution. It is now learned that more than 40 shareholder representatives from Zhenjiang, Shanghai, Wang Jingzhi, Huang Shaoliang, Zhu Hegao, etc. have held a temporary meeting on the 7th and decided: ㊀ Attract capitalists for economic cooperation; ㊁ Rent out the factory; ㊂ Sell the factory. There are three methods, and the board of directors is responsible for selecting one for implementation. It is heard that the reason for the suspension is that the company's output, 900,000 bags per year, is sold in Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Huaiyin, Yancheng, and other ports. Last year, the company that sold in Yangzhou hoarded powder and waited for the price to rise, resulting in a shortage of turnover. It is also heard that the board of directors finds it difficult to implement the second method decided in a short time. Yangzhou's industry and commerce will also wither, and the number of unemployed will increase again.

The Tourism Industry Accuses the Shipping Bureau of Changing Shifts

The Xinyonglong Shipping Bureau in Shaobo Town, the seventh district of Jiangdu, has changed the sailing time of the Yan-Shao shift, causing the tourism industry in Yan and Shao to feel that there are no passengers staying, which hinders their business. They have jointly filed a complaint with the competent authority. It is now heard that the county government has received instructions from the commissioner's office of the seventh district, roughly stating that the company should still follow the prescribed time for sailing before it has been approved and is not allowed to change it without authorization. Violators will be punished.

### Jiaxing

Discovery of Abuse of a Maid Resulting in Death

Shen Quanfu's family, the owner of Shen Hengmao Crockery in Xin Sheng Town, had a maid named Shun Jin, who was only 11 years old. She was often abused. On the first of this month, the maid suddenly died. The owner's family put the body in a crock and buried it somewhere. Later, the Public Security Bureau of Xin Sheng District learned that the maid had died from abuse and arrested Shen Quanfu. They reported to the local court to send someone to the town to open the crock for inspection on the 15th. It was found that there were many injuries on the right temple and lower part of the body. Shen Quanfu was escorted by the court on the 16th for interrogation.

### Hangzhou

County Magistrate Sentenced to Imprisonment for Losing the City

The county seat of Changhua County was captured by bandits on December 21 of last year. The provincial government believed that the county magistrate Jin Mingchang had abandoned his post and stayed in the provincial capital. He was arrested by the police and transferred to the court for trial. Later, the section chief and secretary of the county government were also escorted to Hangzhou for trial. After the investigation was concluded, the judge of the criminal court, Chen Luzhi, brought the prisoners from the detention center at 3:00 pm on the 16th and announced the judgment in court. Yu Mingchang was sentenced to four years of imprisonment for abandoning his duties and causing the loss of the county seat. Li An, the chief of the public security section, was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment. Wei Yinghuang, the secretary, was sentenced to three years of imprisonment.

### Ningbo

The Military and Police Inspection Office Ends

The joint military and police inspection office in this port was established in November of last year. Now that the winter defense has expired, the office was ordered to be abolished on the 15th. The office personnel and team leaders of each inspection team transferred from various agencies have been sent back to their original agencies.

### Wuyuan

Snow Falls in Spring Due to Cold Weather

In the past two weeks, the county has experienced continuous spring rains and abnormal weather. Occasionally, it clears up, the scorching sun is like fire, the cuckoo begins to cry, and the azaleas bloom, as if it were the third month of spring. Last night, the weather turned cold again, with howling winds. In the middle of the night, snowflakes danced in the air. The high mountains and peaks were covered with three or four inches of snow, the first heavy snow of the past winter and this spring.

Tea Tax Collection Office Set Up

The county's tea tax was collected by the business tax bureau last year, and no separate bureau was set up. This year, the Gan Tax Bureau believes that Wuyuan and Xiushui counties produce a large amount of tea and that an office should be set up in each county this year as a special collection agency. It has been submitted to the financial hall for submission to the provincial affairs meeting for approval. The tax bureau has commissioned Cheng Yinguo as the director of the tea tax office in the county and ordered him to establish and report immediately. After receiving the commission, Cheng established the office on the 11th.

National Goods Special Issue

### An Address to the Members of the Japanese Economic Survey Mission

— Yang An

The Japanese Economic Survey Mission has come to China to investigate the economy. From the perspective of the national goods industry, I would like to offer a few words to the gentlemen of the mission:

First, the mission should know that the national goods industry in China has been operating arduously in recent years. Fortunately, it has not been wiped out, thanks to the patriotic enthusiasm of the people and the efforts of our industrial sector. Our industrial and commercial sectors have no conflict with the Japanese industrial and commercial sectors and do not hinder them. I hope the Japanese industrial and commercial sectors will not be jealous or afraid. It must be known that our country's industry and commerce are seeking a way out, which is to seek survival. The desire to survive is inherent in human beings. A country's attention to its national industry is the basis for a country's nation to survive. Japan is like this, and so is China. If we treat each other with compassion and think about the other party in everything, there will be no problems.

Second, to make products welcome and popular, the first thing is to make the other party feel good and have faith. If you give people unpleasant things and bad impressions every day, and want the other party to be willing to use my products, there is no such thing in the world. Therefore, I think that the mission should start by correcting the political aspects. Before the political issues are properly resolved, no matter how you talk about Sino-Japanese trade, there will never be satisfactory results.

Third, what the Chinese industrial and commercial sector is most pained by is smuggling. At present, smuggling is still rampant in North China, and the Japanese government has not taken any action to stop it. This kind of method is no different from destroying the lifeblood of Chinese industry and commerce, and putting the industrial and commercial sector to death. If this is not changed, any economic cooperation is out of the question. Moreover, if this continues, enduring and enduring, there will be a day when we can no longer endure it. I am very worried about the future of Chinese trade. I hope that after the members of the mission return to their country, they will quickly report to the government and quickly correct this improper and unreasonable behavior.

I dare to speak frankly because the members of the mission are all leaders in the Japanese economic sector and are very clear about the situation in China, and they are also the hope of both Chinese and Japanese people. I hope you will appreciate my foolish sincerity and adopt it.

### National Doctor's Day and the Promotion of the National Medicine Movement

— Ba Ling

Today, March 17th, is Chinese National Doctor's Day. National associations of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and TCM associations in various places are convening commemorative assemblies to celebrate. In the history of Chinese medicine, this is truly a page worth recording, and one we must not ignore.

However, as members of the national medical community commemorate National Doctor's Day today, the author has some thoughts. Besides making it our goal to purchase domestic goods for our clothing, food, daily necessities, and all other necessities of life, we should also earnestly promote and use Chinese medicine. On the one hand, we will preserve our national essence. At the same time, we can reduce the amount of imported foreign medicines and increase the strength and vitality of the national economy. This is the broad sense of the national goods movement.

At present, our country's Chinese medicine industry has made rapid progress through the efforts of the medical community, which we cannot deny. Now, we need to go further, besides preserving the essence of Chinese medicine (i.e., decocted Chinese medicine), we should also promote and use the famous domestic factories, such as the artificial blood invented by the Wuzhou Pharmacy, the Bushiming recently created by the Xin Ya Pharmaceutical Factory, various cod liver oils from the Zhongxi Pharmacy, Aloe Brain Tonic from the Zhongfa Pharmacy, and the Shiyan Baoxian Gujing Pills from the Aihua Pharmaceutical Society, etc. You should know that I am not here to do free publicity for these domestic factories. In fact, their products have long left a deep, positive, and never-fading impression on the people of society.

In short, as we commemorate National Doctor's Day today, I hope that the medical community will conduct further research on the substance of their profession and, to the extent possible, show more compassion for the poor and helpless patients. At the same time, I also hope that compatriots across the country will purchase and promote the above-mentioned first-class domestic drugs as much as possible. Don't waste good money to buy imported medicines, disregard the national economy, and willingly act as a salesperson for foreign goods. These are the thoughts that the author has on today's National Doctor's Day. What do you think?

### Genuineness and Fair Price

— Master of Yiyi Hall

"Genuineness and fair price" is a common saying in our country's commercial circles. It can also be said to be a "golden rule" for business management. Because, for any store, if it can adhere to "genuineness and fair price," then its business must be prosperous. Otherwise, it will inevitably suffer from sluggish business and even "bankruptcy!" From this perspective, who can deny that the saying "genuineness and fair price" is a "golden rule" for business management?

Now, I feel that at a time when everyone is enthusiastically promoting "national products," while being eager to buy "national products," some people are also being "blinded by greed" and disguising "imported goods" to pass them off as "national products!" We often hear about such things; it cannot be said to be "completely unique."

We must understand that using "foreign goods" to impersonate "national products" cannot be considered "genuine." As for the price, since it is impersonating "foreign goods," it will inevitably be sold at the original price of "foreign goods." In other words, "foreign goods" are ultimately more expensive than "national products," and their original price will not be lowered simply because they are impersonating "national products." Therefore, if one impersonates "national products" but does not sell them at the corresponding price of "national products," this cannot be considered a "fair price!" Because of this, with the "goods" being not "genuine" and the "price" being not "fair," the result will not only lead to the ultimate failure of one's own business but will also undermine the reputation of "national products!" I think: The slow development of the "national products" industry may well be due to this major reason!

Therefore, the reason I am writing this article on "Genuineness and Fair Price" is simply to hope that the general national products manufacturers will know how to encourage themselves. They should not use non-"national products" to deceive customers, which would make the prices of genuine "national products" also suspected of being unfair. In short, in business management, "genuineness and fair price" are essential, and especially in the business of "national products," "genuineness and fair price" are even more crucial!

### National Products for Civil Servants Year: National Products Pens, Inks, and Paper (Part 1)

— Wang Shouqiu

This year has been designated as the National Products Year for Civil Servants. I hope that civil servants across the country will understand their duties and responsibilities and strive to promote and use national products. I believe that civil servants are all intellectuals and will not forget their duties. Therefore, the National Products Year for Civil Servants will surely bring relatively fruitful results. As a member of the civil service, I offer this as self-encouragement and encouragement to civil servants across the country.

When writing Chinese characters, one should naturally use Chinese pens, Chinese ink, and Chinese paper. However, some civil servants prefer to use imported goods. But there are some distinctions here. Some knowingly use them, while others unknowingly misuse them. The former is more culpable, while the latter can be forgiven. In reality, the latter is more common. Therefore, the Executive Yuan has specially compiled a list of national products for common use by various agencies so that the agencies know what to purchase. I am now forwarding this introduction, hoping that civil servants, students, and people from all sectors of industry and commerce will pay attention and jointly promote the use of national products to recover lost revenue and invigorate national products.

(A) Pencils: ㊀ China Standard Chalk Factory, located at 276 Xiexu Road, Shanghai, with the trademarks "Ding" (鼎) and "Aircraft," produces 15,000 to 45,000 gross annually. Its sales cover the entire country and are managed by Pan Gongzhan and others. It has been issued a national product certificate and is sufficient to represent foreign goods. ㊁ Huawen Pencil Factory, located in Shufeng Beili, Baoding Road, Shanghai, with the trademark "Flying Swallow," produces more than 100,000 gross annually, selling in Shanghai and other domestic ports. It has been issued a national product certificate and is sufficient to replace foreign goods. ㊂ Dahua Pencil Factory, located in Kowloon City, Hong Kong, with the trademarks "Double Arrow" and "Globe," produces 100,000 gross annually. It has been issued a national product certificate and is sufficient to replace foreign goods.

(B) Ink: ㊀ Jincheng Pharmaceutical Factory, located in Xinxinli, Jin Shenfu Road, Shanghai, produces ink and pigments under the trademark of a golden circular "Old Hall," producing 100,000 dozens annually, worth 50,000 yuan. Its sales cover the entire country and the Nanyang Islands and has been registered as a factory. ㊁ Lingsheng Company, located at 47 Tiantong'an Road, Shanghai, produces printing multicolor oil under the trademark of a "Camel," producing 400,000 pounds annually, worth more than 64,000 yuan.

### A Brief Discussion on Sales Promotion (4)

— Ding Kai

㊁ Sales Promotion Also Requires Necessary Investigation and Statistical Work

Since the victory of sales promotion belongs to psychological analysis, the investigation and analysis of the market should also be carried out in parallel. This issue is very obvious. Because the former belongs to speculation and prediction, while the latter belongs to facts and evidence. In the author's opinion, a slightly scaled company or factory must at least collect the following types of materials.

(A) The status of transportation in various places (domestic and foreign Nanyang Islands should be distinguished).

(B) Investigation of the sales status of targeted goods (equal emphasis on imported goods and similar products).

(C) Investigation of the economic status and consumption status of sales, as well as the dynamics of life.

(D) Investigation of the status of foreign merchants handling goods.

(E) Statistical charts of annual business aspects.

In order to study sales promotion, the author often visits the authorities of national product factories or receives consultations from national product manufacturers. I always ask, "Have you seen any materials for business reference?" However, many factories that I have contacted have almost none, and even consider investigation and statistics to be unnecessary waste. On the other hand, foreign merchants pay attention to the dynamics of our business situation. They treat a piece of information like a rare feather. Not only do commercial officials stationed in China use the government's position to help their national factories with information work, but there are even factory representatives stationed in China who come from thousands of miles away. They are both promoting goods and collecting information. It can be seen that only by knowing yourself and your enemy can you be victorious in every battle.

### Deliberations on Changing the Route of National Product Visits

— Zhang Mengzhao

A contribution to the National Products Movement Association and the Visiting Ladies

The ancient saying, "Just ask about cultivation, don't ask about harvest," contains the meaning of using one's spirit to gain one's career. The history of the national products movement is also more than twenty years old. It is only now that it is splendid and flourishing, showing that things are done by people. Just ask about cultivation, don't ask about the harvest, indeed has a profound meaning. The efforts of the female national product visitors are deeply imprinted in our minds. Therefore, Mr. Yang Yao, in his "Contribution Words" article, proved that "national product visits have indeed made great contributions to the development of the national product industry!

However, I still have some personal opinions to contribute to the gentlemen of the National Products Movement Committee and the ladies of the National Product Visitors. That is, the route of the visits should be changed as soon as possible. As everyone knows, the western district of Shanghai is a concentrated area of so-called higher-class Chinese families who are aristocratic or Westernized, with the greatest purchasing power and the greatest consumption of foreign goods. Visits and persuasion to switch to national products are imperative. However, although the eastern district of Shanghai is said to be an industrial area, there are also many family residences in the Pingliang Road, Yulin Road, Chuanpeng Road, Yangshupu Road area. It is also a densely populated area of men, women, and workers. Their impression of national products is even weaker. Because of the large population, the consumption power is also very surprising. Our comrades who love national products really do not want them to use the money earned from their sweat and blood to promote foreign goods and send money to foreigners. I think that the visiting ladies should quickly plan to change the route and visit the eastern district of Shanghai to work hard to guide the national products of the lower classes. Do not overemphasize neglecting the families of so many toiling masses, which is also very sufficient to affect the future of national products. This is the motivation for me to write this article, hoping to achieve it after commercial rights!

### Production and Consumers of First-Class National Products

— Qiu Lang

This year is known as the National Products Year for Civil Servants. All civil servants should make special efforts for national products. Therefore, Mayor Wu and Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau of this city, standing in the position of leaders, in order to enable the general civil servants and the public to have a deeper understanding of national products, Mayor Wu personally inscribed the words "Promote Recognition of First-Class National Products" to promote and introduce them. This is very admirable to us. However, the author has two thorough ideas about this and dares to excerpt them below. ㊀ All major national trade factories in the country should strive for beauty and durability in terms of crack goods, deliver goods quickly, and strive for low waste in terms of pricing. If so, both increase the faith of buyers, the business will naturally develop, and meet the first-class national products of the good name. ㊁ Consumers, in view of the fact that our country already has fine and inexpensive first-class national trade, should naturally do their best to promote medicinal use, and should never buy external loans again, and there is no need to buy foreign goods, so that the two parties of production and consumption can sincerely cooperate, I can determine that the number of excess imports can be gradually reduced, and to reduce, the national economy and people's livelihood, can naturally become increasingly prosperous.

### West Qing Volleyball Team Wins Championship

▲ Hai Qing Suffers Another Defeat

Since Hai Qing Jia lost to the Russian Army, it was known that its bid for the championship was in jeopardy. However, there was a glimmer of hope: if Hai Qing could lose to West Qing again in the first round, there could still be a triangular contest for a last chance. Unfortunately, the god of volleyball was not with them. In last night's first game, it became a one-sided situation. West Qing won with 15-6 very easily. In the second game, although Hai Qing actively fought back, they were unable to reverse the situation with 13-15. In another match, the Russian Army beat Su Ke Er in two games. Su Ke Er only scored four points, and the difference in strength was like heaven and earth. Thus, West Qing won the championship with five wins and one loss. The Russian Army took second place with four wins and two losses. Hai Qing, the champion of last year, fell to third place with one win and three losses. Su Ke Er did not win a single match and only managed to win one game against Hai Qing in the first match, thus finishing last. In yesterday's match, Hai Qing's Weinoda Gai and Zhang Renming did not play and were replaced by Chen Zhiguang and Liu Zichang from Group B, which also had some impact, it is said. Today, there are two matches in the women's group, with the following schedule:

### Yugu Village Case

Secretary-General Yu Visited Feixin Dun Yesterday, the First Special District Federation Sent a Letter Requesting Restoration

Central News Agency reports that since Yugu Village, a key thoroughfare in the road-crossing section, was blocked by the Public Concession's Public Works Department due to tenants' refusal to pay housing taxes, the two sides have been at a stalemate and have not yet resolved the issue. The Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, in order to break the deadlock, specially consulted with Feixin Dun, Director-General of the Public Works Department, yesterday to discuss a solution. The main points are as follows: ⑴ The Public Works Department of the Public Concession will immediately remove the obstacles blocking Yugu Village and restore the sewers and drains to their original state. ⑵ The owners will temporarily find a way to collect all the owed housing taxes in the neighborhood and pay them to the Municipal Government. After receiving these housing taxes, the Municipal Government will negotiate with the Public Works Department to partially resolve the housing tax issue in the road-crossing area. If a solution is reached, the funds will be allocated according to the new solution; otherwise, the funds will be paid to the Public Works Department as compensation for the residents' use of the sewers and drains in the area.

Xin Sheng Daily reports that the First Special District Citizens' Federation, after receiving a report from the citizens' branch in the district requesting assistance, sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday morning stating that the Yugu Village area in the jurisdiction of the Municipal Police Department had been forced to pay housing taxes by Police Chief Huang using means such as blocking traffic, causing all residents to lose their freedom of movement innocently and causing significant unrest. The responsibility of the municipal government is to ensure the safety of public order, and the fact that your bureau is using any means necessary is deeply regrettable. Therefore, we specially request that your bureau call a halt, voluntarily remove all obstacles in Yugu Village, and avoid causing unfortunate and serious consequences. This is what we are happy to see.

### Liu Jingshan Flew Back to Shanghai Yesterday

Xin Xin Daily reports that the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, invested in by the China Construction Bank and domestic financial circles, along the main line from Chengdu to Chongqing (referred to as the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway), the officially determined land price along the line was originally intended to be purchased at 25 yuan per mu. However, the landowners requested an increase in the land price, so the company sent Liu Jingshan, assistant manager of the China Construction Bank and director of the company, to Sichuan. After long-term negotiations with Liu Xiang, chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, and the landowners, it was agreed to purchase the land at an average price of 45 yuan per mu. However, the provincial government still requested a limit of 50 yuan, a very small difference that is not difficult to resolve.

### British Community Nominates New Members for the Shanghai Municipal Council

Japanese Candidates Must Be Elected Separately

The British Residents' Association of Shanghai held a meeting last week to elect five British candidates for the new 1937 Shanghai Municipal Council. The election results were announced on Monday: Messrs. Keeler (Brunner, Mond & Co.), King (Jardine Matheson & Co.), MacDonald (Mackenzie & Co.), McIntosh (Krouse & Co.), and Pott (formerly of the British Consular Service in China) were elected. Five other candidates, including Mr. Hailes, were not elected. Of the five elected members, only Mr. Pott is an incumbent councilor. Mr. Keeler was a councilor previously. The remaining three, although well-respected in the business community, are newcomers to municipal affairs. The current British councilors who did not seek re-election are Messrs. Snowden, Keswick, Mitcham, and Major General MacNaghten. The number of American, British, and Japanese candidates nominated this year is in accordance with the regulations, so there may not be an election to avoid unnecessary trouble. The Japanese candidates previously nominated were Messrs. Yamamoto and Urape, but since both have declined to run, other candidates must be nominated to replace them. However, the number will still be two. The date for the election of Chinese councilors has been set for April 5th and 6th. The deadline for submitting candidate applications is February 27th, at which time the final list should be announced. Mr. Summerson of the Hope Guiding Fire Insurance Company and Mr. Paulsen, General Manager of the Great Ale Ray Report Company, have been invited to serve as ballot counters and have accepted.

### City Federation Opposes Municipal Council's Tax Increase

Declaration Issued Yesterday

The Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of this city has issued a declaration regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's proposed increase in the general municipal tax. The declaration states: "We recently read in the newspapers that the Public Concession's Municipal Council intends to increase the general municipal tax to 16% (an increase of 2%), which seems likely to be implemented. We are deeply shocked by this. The Municipal Council's excuse of balancing its revenue and expenditure to implement the tax increase is simply untenable. Although the Municipal Council's revenue was reduced by a significant 1,250,000 yuan last year due to the economic downturn, the council's austerity policies have not considered the bigger picture. For example, the exchange allowances for foreign staff and the exorbitant costs of the band have not been eliminated. If these two items could be saved and used to offset the shortfall, it would be more than sufficient. This shows that there is still much waste in expenditure. As for the claim that the tax rate in the Public Concession is lower than in any other city in the world, regardless of whether this statement is true, circumstances vary and the ability of taxpayers to pay also differs. This cannot be used as a reason for increasing taxes. Moreover, in any city in the world, the largest proportion of taxes is used to improve the welfare of taxpayers. The Public Concession's Municipal Council has failed to fully achieve this. Furthermore, the Municipal Council believes that the economy has improved and that an increase may be possible. This is a superficial view. It is well known that the decline in the Municipal Council's revenue in recent years is solely due to the economic downturn. The economic recovery is a good opportunity for the municipal authorities to support industry and commerce and cultivate tax revenues. If given a little time, tax revenues will surely return to their former levels. Now, the Municipal Council wants to compensate for the decline in tax revenue by taking it from the taxpayers. From whom will the taxpayers, whose incomes have also declined, take it? This is only to obstruct the recovery of industry and commerce. In short, the Municipal Council should understand that under the current circumstances, there is no valid reason to increase taxes. The Federation hereby solemnly declares that if the Public Concession's Municipal Council disregards the opinions of its constituents and insists on increasing taxes, then those who agree to the increase should bear all the expenses of the Municipal Council. This declaration is made."

### Shanghai County Government Organizes Grain Storage Measures

The Shanghai County Government recently received an order from the Provincial Government to issue a plan for the implementation of grain storage. County Magistrate Li Zhifu, after receiving the order, believed that grain storage for famine relief is an important local policy and should be strictly followed. Therefore, he ordered Qi Kezhong, the Director of Construction, to work with Wang Chengyao, the Director of the County Treasury, to formulate eight revised measures based on local needs: ① Expand the county granary and request the allocation of 5,000 yuan from the grain storage funds to build ten additional granary rooms on the existing county granary land. The county will prepare a budget and drawings and submit them to the province for approval. Bids will be invited for construction, and the province will be notified for inspection upon completion. ② Establish district granaries and assess the financial resources of each district. The district organizing committee will select a site and build the district granary. The expenses will be raised by the committee. ③ The total amount of grain stored in the county and district granaries should be expanded year by year according to their financial resources, with the total amount of grain stored sufficient to meet the needs of the entire county population for three months. ④ Rotate old grain and replace it with new grain annually to prevent spoilage. ⑤ The county and district granaries will apply to the provincial government to send personnel for inspection at least once a year. ⑥ The county granary will be managed by the Grain Management Committee, and the district granaries will be managed by the district committees. ⑦ The management expenses will be included in the local budget and will not be paid from the grain storage funds or grain funds. ⑧ County and district granaries may pledge grain to obtain loans to support rural production with approval from the provincial government.

### Chinese Laborers Who Served in France During WWI Are Scheduled to Return to Their Hometowns

Before Departing, They Request the Authorities to Return Their Money Deposited in France

The thirty-three Chinese laborers, including Ding Huanzhang, who served in France during World War I, have returned to China and arrived in Shanghai. However, they have not been able to leave Shanghai because they lack funds for transportation. Yesterday, they sent representatives to the police station to request that ship tickets be distributed. The Second Section Chief, Hong Qi, received them and promised to issue the tickets within one or two days. With the ship tickets secured, the laborers plan to return to their hometowns on the afternoon of the 18th. Eighteen of them are going to Tianjin, six to Qingdao, two to Nanjing, two to Wuxi, two to Xuzhou, and three to Changsha. At the same time, the Chinese laborers, with the assistance of Mr. Yang Gengtao, have decided to hold a tea party at 4 p.m. today to thank Mr. Yang. Furthermore, Ding and others jointly submitted a petition to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, requesting that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs order the consulate in Paris to return their deposits. The petition stated: "We respectfully request the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to forward this petition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ordering the Consulate General in Paris, France, to return our deposits and hand them over to your Bureau for distribution to us. Ding Huanzhang and thirty-two others went to Europe to participate in the war in the fifth year of the Republic [1916]. On February 5th of this year, we were repatriated by the French government on the Platine mail ship and arrived safely in Shanghai on the 11th of this month, receiving your Bureau's thoughtful care, for which we are grateful. However, twenty-three of these thirty-three people have deposits in the Paris Consulate General. Due to the urgency of our departure from France, we were unable to withdraw them. Although we pleaded with the Chinese Consulate in Marseille and sent an airmail letter when the ship docked in Colombo, requesting the Paris Consulate General to telegraph the deposits back to Shanghai to be used as travel expenses for Huanzhang and others to return home, more than a month has passed and we have not yet received them. Now, Huanzhang and others have been unemployed for too long and have no savings. The cost of living in Shanghai is high, and we have no choice but to return to our hometowns as soon as possible to find a new life. In addition to submitting a separate list and specifying the amount of deposits to be retained by your Bureau, we will report our confirmed mailing addresses to your Bureau after we return to our hometowns. Once the deposits are received, please remit them to us individually. We are most grateful. Respectfully submitted."

### Cultural Construction Association Held Regular Board Meeting Yesterday

Postponement of the First Representative Congress

The China Cultural Construction Association held a standing committee meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 1:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included Chen Lifu, Chairman of the Association (represented by Wu Tiecheng); Wu Tiecheng, Vice Chairman; Pan Gongzhan, Standing Director and Secretary-General; and Standing Directors Li Zhaohuan, Li Denghui (represented by Wu Nanxuan), Liu Zhanen, Ou Yuanhuai, Zhang Shuyong, and Pei Fuheng. Zhu Jiahua and Weng Zhilong were excused. Wu Tiecheng chaired the meeting and Huang Jingsu served as the recorder.

After the meeting commenced as scheduled, the Chairman delivered a report, stating that today's meeting was of the Standing Committee of the China Cultural Construction Association. Chairman Chen Wenfu was in urgent need of rest due to illness, and therefore sent a letter entrusting his representation. Since the establishment of the Association, it has been three years, and all work, except for those that have not achieved the original goals or cannot be completed as scheduled due to economic and environmental constraints, the rest of the work has been carried out with great effort. In addition to the written work report, the Secretary-General will also provide a detailed report on the association's revenue and expenditure. The Chairman believed that it is not easy to create a cause. We hope that the association's affairs can be actively promoted and expanded. In order to prevent the Association from becoming a mere facade, it is indispensable to have the assistance and participation of all sectors of society. Because cultural undertakings are very broad, the participation of all sectors of society is necessary to achieve results through joint efforts. Although the association is still in its infancy, as long as we continue to work hard, in ten or fifty years, the association may be an important academic group in China. Because the success of all undertakings is due to the efforts of a few people in the beginning, and then gradually developed and become solid and grand. The Association intends to hold a membership representative conference this year in the hope of participation and joint efforts from all sectors of society. Because in the past three years, the association has branches in various provinces and cities, in order to promote the collection of opinions from all parties and to contact people from all walks of life, it is also necessary to hold this representative conference. I hope that all of you present today will give us some advice.

Then, the Secretary-General of the Association, Pan Gongzhan, reported on the work of the Association and the financial situation. The speech was omitted for brevity. Subsequently, the proposals were discussed:

㊀ The first membership representative conference of the Association was originally scheduled to be held on April 3rd and 4th. Due to the fact that the election of representatives from various branches has not been completed, it is proposed to postpone it and request approval of the date. It was resolved to postpone the conference to July 10th and 11th of this year and to still be held in Shanghai.

㊁ How to proceed with the preparatory matters for the first membership representative conference of the Association? It was resolved that the preparatory matters for the membership representative conference should be urged and actively handled by the Secretary-General. In addition, a special collection of academic papers should be compiled and printed. The Association should formulate regulations for soliciting articles and send them to the directors, members, experts, etc. to write.

㊂ The first phase of the Association's Reading and Advancement Competition has ended. How should the bonus be issued? It was resolved to issue the bonus as usual and to be paid by the Secretary-General from the Association's funds.

㊃ Review of the draft outline of the Association's work plan. It was resolved to appoint five directors, Liu Hongen, Li Denghui, Ou Yuanhuai, Li Zhaohuan, and Pei Fuheng, to review and supplement it together with the Secretary-General, and submit it to the next standing committee meeting for discussion. Mr. Liu Zhanen was requested to convene the meeting.

㊄ The Jiangxi Branch reported that Ding, the director of the branch, had left Ganzhou without permission. It is proposed to appoint Xiong Tianyi as the successor to the position of director to provide leadership. Please review the case. It was resolved to approve the appointment and to put it on record.

㊅ The Qingdao Branch and other branches requested instructions on how to provide travel expenses for the representatives attending the membership representative conference. Please review the case. It was resolved that the Association would provide appropriate subsidies for the travel expenses of the attending representatives. The Secretary-General was requested to prepare a draft budget for the representative conference and submit it to the next standing committee meeting for discussion.

㊅ Due to the vacancies of Standing Directors Shao Yuanchong and Wu Xingya, and the resignation of Shen Pengfei, it is proposed to elect replacements. It was resolved to appoint Zhou Fohai, Wang Yunwu, and Wang Boqi as replacement directors, as well as other routine cases. The meeting adjourned.

### Zhu Qinglan and Others Went to Henan for Disaster Relief Last Night

Meet with Liu Zhi and Shang Zhen in Kaifeng, then Inspect Various Counties in Western Henan

Zhang Fang, a member of the Central Committee and Chairman of the Henan Relief Committee, came to Shanghai specifically because of the severe drought in Henan Province to ask for assistance from all sectors. The Shanghai Municipal Relief Committee for the Henan Drought was formed to carry out fundraising and relief. The Ministry of Finance first borrowed 100,000 yuan to handle emergency relief. Zhu Qingyu, Lu Bohong, and Mu Ouchu were appointed to go to Henan Province to investigate and provide relief. It is now known that Zhu and others took the Shanghai-Ping Train to Henan at 12:00 last night. The planned itinerary is to first go to Kaifeng to meet with Liu Zhi, Director of the Pacification of Henan and Anhui, and Shang Zhen, Chairman of Henan Province, to discuss relief measures, and then go to various counties in western Henan to investigate and provide relief, and then go to other places for inspection. It is planned to stay in Henan for about two weeks and then return to Shanghai. Zhang originally intended to accompany Zhu and others to Henan for investigation and relief. However, due to the troops stationed in Jiangxi and urgent military affairs to be dealt with, he changed his plan to go to Jiangxi first to handle military affairs, and then go to Henan to join the relief efforts. Therefore, Guo Fangwu, the director of the Luoyang Xingdu Orphanage in the province, was first sent to accompany Zhu and others to investigate and provide relief.

### Request to Revise Income Tax: Capital Tax Assessment

Shen Liren Submits Suggestions to the Ministry of Finance

New News Agency reported that Shen Liren, Director Accountant of the China Accounting Firm, submitted a document to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance yesterday to request the revision of the Income Tax Regulations to use the actual amount of capital as the standard for taxation. The document stated, "I hereby submit this document to request the amendment of the Income Tax Regulations, and to present my humble opinions, hoping that you will consider and adopt them.

Since the formal implementation of income tax in our country, the government has lightly taken from the people and enriched the national treasury. The people support good taxes and willingly comply. This shows that the law is good and the intentions are good, and the prospects for taxation are promising. However, upon reviewing Article 3 of Chapter 2 of the Income Tax Regulations, which states that the tax rate should be determined based on the percentage of income to the actual amount of capital, and considering precedents from various countries and the commercial situation in our country, it seems that this is not entirely appropriate. I believe that there is a need for amendment.

I dare to present my humble opinions as follows: According to the income tax calculation methods of advanced countries in Europe and the United States, regardless of the amount of capital, taxes are collected based on the amount of income using a progressive system. The procedures are simple and easy to calculate. In our country, most stores are partnerships with unlimited liability, and the organization of limited liability companies is less common. They often use small capital to do big business, relying on loans from money houses and deposits from relatives and friends as their working capital. If the actual amount of capital is used as the standard for taxation, it does not seem fair. This is the first point that should be amended.

Old-style stores in our country are mostly partnerships with unlimited liability and generally do not have sufficient capital for operation. Managers have to find other ways to cope. When stores have surpluses, in order to consolidate their business foundation and prevent bad debts and price fluctuations, they have to hide a portion of the surplus. Therefore, when a store opens, it only has a capital of several thousand yuan. After several decades, in addition to paying dividends or equivalent bonuses as usual each year, the hidden assets may amount to tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands. Capitalists may know about these hidden assets, but because they cannot find out the exact amount, they can only let it go. Now that the income tax rate is based on capital, these types of stores will inevitably find ways to increase capital in order to pay less tax. However, capitalists may not want to contribute more cash. Therefore, the managers will have to reveal all the hidden assets accumulated over the years. When the capitalists see this huge surplus, they will worry about whether they can make a profit by continuing to operate and will advocate for dissolution. This is not speculation, but a fact that has been seen in the past. The reason for this is none other than the influence of the regulations. This is the second point that should be amended.

The salaries and wages of employees in various industries in our country have always been very meager. They rely entirely on the year-end bonus to supplement their income. This method encourages diligence and loyalty, and should not be criticized. Now, because of the income tax regulations and the capital issue, if capital is increased, the percentage of annual surplus compared to capital will inevitably be lower, and the employees' bonus will be smaller. In the future, labor-capital disputes will arise, and it will be difficult to cooperate harmoniously, and the business will be difficult to promote. Since the promulgation of the income tax regulations, research conferences have been held everywhere. The important issues discussed are nothing more than capital and public reserve. If the articles can be amended, the calculation will be simple, and merchants will easily understand, and they will be happy to pay taxes. This is the third point that should be amended.

Calculating income tax based on capital is cumbersome. If capital is reported first and then the amount of income is reported, it is two things done in one, and merchants are afraid of the trouble. For example, in Shanghai, although the deadline has been extended repeatedly, only a few merchants have reported. This is not because merchants do not obey the law, but because the procedures are too complicated. Also, the regulations stipulate that those with capital below 2,000 yuan are exempt from tax. Therefore, some merchants have reduced their capital in the hope of evading taxes. Although some have operated with a capital of tens of thousands of yuan, they are now changing it to less than 2,000 yuan. This is not because merchants dare to break the law, but because the regulations give them an opportunity to take advantage of. If this capital standard can be changed and taxes are levied based on the amount of surplus, it will not only save procedures, but also prevent the abuse of reducing capital to evade taxes. This is the fourth point that should be amended.

According to Article 7, Paragraph 2 of the Income Tax Implementation Rules, "Those with public reserve may calculate one-third of the total amount into capital." However, Item 5 of the Income Tax Collection Instructions states, "The public reserve mentioned in Article 7, Paragraph 2 of the Implementation Rules is limited to the public reserve stipulated by laws and regulations." The statutory public reserve is limited to limited liability companies, and most commercial organizations in our country are partnerships with unlimited liability. Therefore, their public reserve cannot enjoy the same treatment as limited liability companies. This is also unbalanced in terms of justice. This is the fifth point that should be amended.

In summary, the inapplicability of the capital regulations can be proven by facts. Income tax is a good tax, and the regulations should be perfected to prevent loopholes and simplify procedures. Preventing loopholes is the way to enrich tax sources, and simplifying procedures is the way to avoid disturbing the people.

I hope that you, with your high merit and broad mind, will widely collect opinions from the people. I dare to present my humble opinions and contribute my small wisdom. Whether it is appropriate or not, I have prepared this document and respectfully submit it to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance for your consideration and adoption. I am sincerely awaiting your instructions.

Respectfully submitted to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance.

### Joint Conference of Silk and Cocoon Industry Associations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Held Yesterday

Discussing Cocoon Purchasing Methods and Requesting Restrictions on Cocoon Exports

The Joint Conference of Silk and Cocoon Industry Associations of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces was held at the Silk Factory Trade Association Hall on North Shansi Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. The meeting discussed various issues such as cocoon purchasing methods for the current spring season. Attendees included Chen Xiaoqing, Xu Haoran, Jing Shaoxin, Wei Shixin, Chen Xie Kun, Ma Yintang, Hu Yinjie from Jiangsu Province, and Jiang Laixian, Zhou Yangsong, Zhang Youyi, Wang Yaquan, Hu Jinxiu, Shen Huachen from Zhejiang Province. Zhu Jing'an and others attended as observers, totaling more than 20 people. Chu Huiseng was elected as the temporary chairman.

After the formalities were completed, the chairman first reported on the status of the cocoon industry in the two provinces. Then the discussion began:

㊀ The cost of modifying and installing drying machines is too high, and the industry's strength is weak and unable to purchase them. How should we provide relief? Resolution: The situations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are different. This case should be submitted separately by Jiangsu. Before drying machines are widely installed, please allow the retention of traditional stoves for relief.

㊁ Cooperatives are using the name of cocoon drying for members to collect cocoons for profit, causing many abuses. How should we take measures to ban this to protect the interests of cocoon farmers and avoid disrupting the control? Resolution: Request the authorities of the two provinces to strictly ban it with effective measures.

㊂ Method for collecting union fees. Resolution: The two provinces will collect fees as usual.

㊃ Establishment of a joint office of silk and cocoon in the two provinces for liaison. Resolution: According to the previous resolution, first establish a joint office of the cocoon industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces. The joint organization of the silk industry in the two provinces should be discussed after seeking consent.

㊄ Proposed request to the governments of the two provinces to order various agricultural fields to expand the cultivation of high-quality mulberry seedlings to develop sericulture. Resolution: Jiangsu Province is already actively carrying out this plan. This case should be submitted separately by Zhejiang to request expansion and unlimited seed distribution as much as possible.

㊅ Proposed request to the sericulture authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to formulate measures to reward private seed production and support its development. Resolution: Passed.

㊅ Prescribe the central cocoon price. Resolution: Passed. Request the authorities of the two provinces to prescribe the central cocoon price.

㊇ Now that income tax has been levied, the central government should be requested to abolish the business tax on the cocoon industry to reduce the burden and avoid double taxation. Resolution: Passed. The two provinces will submit separate requests for exemption.

㊈ A letter will be sent to the money industry to request a lighter margin for cocoon collection loans. Resolution: A letter will be sent to the money industry in the two provinces to set the standard at 30% for cocoon collection loans.

㊉ Proposed request to the government to restrict the amount of cocoon exports to avoid endangering the domestic industry. Resolution: Request the central government to consider that even if there is a bumper harvest, exports should be restricted to avoid affecting the domestic industry.

### Settlement of Conditions for British Tram Workers

Supplementary Retirement Gold Provisions

The Shanghai Tram Company, a British-owned company in the Public Concession, had its entire staff of ticket sellers, drivers, machinists, and other workers requesting that the company improve their treatment. Yesterday, Lu Jingshi, a member of the Municipal Party Department, Lu Yinchu, of the Civil Affairs Section, and Yu Yaoxuan, of the Investigation Section, together with Zhu Jintao of the Shanghai General Labor Union and Gong Yuting and others, went to the company's general office on South Suzhou Road to mediate. The company's General Manager Irving, Hu Ziyu, the Chinese comprador, and the heads of the vehicle and machinery departments received them. After consultation, it was decided to supplement two provisions regarding retirement pay:

㊀ Those who have served diligently for 25 years may apply to the company for retirement and be given one month's salary for each year of service, with the remainder extrapolated, but the company may not unreasonably refuse.

㊁ Those who have served diligently for 20 years and have been approved for retirement will be given half a month's salary for each year of service, with the remainder extrapolated. (The above two retirement payments are calculated based on the average actual salary earned over the years, excluding all allowances.)

As for the retirement conditions decided in the last mediation, they will be implemented as usual, and the supplementary conditions will be translated and announced by the company.

### Fish Market Sends Letter to Fisheries Bank to Handle Fishmonger Loans

Improve Dock Facilities

In order to benefit fishmongers, the Shanghai Fish Market's board of directors has drafted a letter to the Fisheries Banking Group requesting that it allocate funds to handle fishmonger credit cooperatives, small fishmonger loan syndicates, or fishmonger business trust companies. This has been approved by the Ministry of Industry and is currently being planned and implemented by the Fisheries Banking Group. In addition to this, the market has also set up a fishmonger rest room and has successively added corner protections to the four sides of the dock, including triangular wooden steps at the bridge intersections, and placed bridge water cables. The monthly road maintenance fees paid by the fishmonger vehicles have also recently been waived.

### Book Prices Not Easily Reduced

Paper Prices Soar, Almost Doubling

The Municipal Education Association of this city recently sent a letter to the Book Industry Association of this city, discussing the reduction of textbook prices. It is reported that the members of the association have always kept the prices of teaching materials and books extremely low, in order to reduce the burden on student families. Recently, paper prices have soared. Other industries may have increased prices along with the increase in costs, but the members of the association are currently temporarily maintaining the original prices in order to support education and have not increased them. However, due to the pressure of the situation, there is no way to further reduce them.

It has been learned that their reply to the Municipal Education Association contains the following statements: "Regarding the reduction of book prices, the members have implemented it last year. Before last year, paper prices were low and competition among the industry was fierce, leading to price reductions. Most publishers have been struggling to survive, some have closed down, and some have defaulted on wages. In recent days, paper prices have soared, and printing houses are tightening their belts. Based on current prices, not only can we not reduce prices further, but we fear that we will not be able to avoid increasing prices to maintain operations."

Regarding the matter of book price reductions, the association also received a dispatch from the Ministry of Education forwarded by the Social Affairs Bureau. The association convened a meeting of all executive committee members, who all said that since the unified sales method for primary and secondary school textbooks was stipulated by the Ministry of Education in April of last year, the various bookstores have sold secondary school textbooks at 80% of the original price and primary school education books at 60% of the original price since August of the same year. The book discounts offered by each bookstore were originally not uniform, with some offering no discounts, some offering 95% discounts, and some offering as low as 70% or 80% discounts. Some reprinted ancient books were sold at only 10% of the marked price. Since the implementation of the unified sales method stipulated by the Ministry's order, the original discounts have been reduced across the board and changed to actual prices for sale. Even those who originally had no discounts and whose prices were lower, have mostly been adjusted separately, reducing prices. Price reduction lists were also printed. The Ministry's order instructed to further reduce the prices of primary and secondary school textbooks and to reduce the prices of ordinary books as much as possible, showing the government's thoroughness in promoting culture. However, since the beginning of winter last year, the prices of all commodities have risen, especially the prices of paper and ink, which are the raw materials for books. Compared with before August, they have increased more than double. Since January 15th, various industries in the city have published notices to increase prices, including wire balls, wood villages, knitted refined handkerchief machines, dyeing and weaving, hemp thread, sauce gardens, copper and iron machinery, dyeing silk stockings, silk and satin dyeing workshops, freight trucks, Hangzhou silk brocades, mirror boxes, flannel factories, absorbent cotton cloth, towels, yarn ribbons, biscuits, candies, bread, red cloth head ropes, thermos bottles, bicycle sales, firecrackers, cork, grass flannel hats, foundry factories, coal, incense, candles, electrical manufacturing, hardware, porcelain, blacksmithing, shoe industry, board industry, seasoning manufacturing, gold paint, electrical silk weaving, reed organs, pharmaceutical manufacturing, dental bone equipment, soap making, woodenware, umbrellas, matte yarn threads, dyeing industry, pottery, phonographs, letterpress printing, silk edges, weaving industry, etc., more than 50 industries. Among them, there are even copper weaving machines, foundries, candy biscuits, soap making, and letterpress printing, which have announced two price increases. The relationship between the printing industry and books is particularly close. According to the association's announcement on February 26th of this year, the original prices have been increased by 50%. It can be seen that various books are already in a situation where prices must be increased. Selling at the reduced prices after August of last year has been difficult to sustain. The book industry originally intended to serve culture, and did not dare to request price increases in order to avoid increasing the burden on primary and secondary school students and general readers, when there was still hope that paper prices would fall. The original prices of primary and secondary school textbooks were already very low, and after huge discounts, they have now been changed to the original discounted prices, which have been reduced as much as possible. It is requested that the Social Affairs Bureau forward this information to the Ministry of Education to understand the difficulties of the merchants and exempt them from further reductions. If the prices of raw materials such as paper and ink continue to rise, they should continue to be allowed to increase prices to maintain costs. It has been decided to report the situation accordingly.

### Charity Federation Solicits Clothes

The Shanghai Charity Federation Joint Disaster Relief Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other organizations yesterday, soliciting clothes, stating that it has received a report from Zhuan Nian, a commissioner of the Relief Committee, stating that the Zaobian area has recently been severely disturbed by remnant bandits, and the disaster situation is extremely tragic. The general disaster victims are displaced and have no clothes or food, resembling starving people.

Accordingly, this letter is sent in the hope that your association will have compassion for these orphaned children and generously donate funds to meet their urgent needs.

Please donate them as soon as possible and hand them over to the association for distribution and relief to benefit the disaster victims in the border area.

### Italian National Sentenced for Fraud

The Italian national, Kang Qini, was accused of impersonating the head of the Public Concession's anti-narcotics police squad and defrauding a Chinese man in Murongming Road of 400 yuan. The Italian Consul General's court in Shanghai found him guilty on Sunday and sentenced him to eight months in prison and a fine of 656 lire (Italian currency). He was also ordered to be deported during his prison term.

According to the case, on February 16, the defendant colluded with a Chinese man to go to a residence on Murongming Road, claiming that he and his companions were secret agents from the police station searching for heroin and red pills. At that time, a woman in the house was panicked and agreed to pay 400 yuan to avoid being taken to the police station. The Chinese man was soon arrested by a secret agent from the Jing'an Temple Road police station and has been punished by the court according to law. The Italian national also surrendered to the police station after the incident.

Zhou Baogui, a Ningbo native, has been running the Xieshunchang Cotton Cloth Store on Zhengjia Wooden Bridge Street, Caishi Street (south-facing) for over ten years. Business has been good, with a surplus. His family resides at No. 3, Lane 1, No. 97, Chujia Bridge North Bank, Lian Ti Ni Yin Road, in the first lane of Liuxian Village, a three-story building. Recently, Zhou opened a branch store in Nanyang Bridge, which just opened the day before yesterday. Yesterday at 12:10 PM, Zhou returned home for lunch. The maid was just serving the meal, and the errand boy from the old store on Zhengjia Wooden Bridge Street returned home to deliver rice through the back alley. Unexpectedly, six robbers followed him in. Four of them held Mauser pistols, threatening the victim to remain silent and driving the schoolgirl and the maid into the living room, where they were guarded by two robbers. The remaining robbers went upstairs, ransacking drawers and chests, engaging in wanton looting. They demanded the mistress's jewelry box and locksmith, injuring her left hand in the process. The looting lasted an hour. Before leaving, the robbers took off their old cotton gowns and exchanged them for the looted fox-trimmed, gray squirrel, and sherisun fur coats. They also wrapped the stolen crepe around their waists. They then fled with the stolen clothing and accessories through the back alley. The loot included over 400 yuan in cash, two diamond rings, four gold rings, three gem rings, gold lockets, small gold foreign coins, and silk and fur clothing, totaling about 8,000 to 9,000 yuan. Afterward, the authorities were notified, and detectives from the French Concession police station came to investigate.

### A Young Woman Jumps into the River Due to Marital Unhappiness

A Letter of Complaint Found

Xu Guifang, a local from Mugou Bridge in Tangqiao Town, Pudong, who works at a paper mill, married a woman named Zheng from the same town through a matchmaker years ago. At the beginning of their marriage, the couple's relationship was harmonious. However, Xu Jinfang was naturally dissolute and did not engage in honest work. His wife tried to persuade him, but was instead beaten and scolded. Later, Xu became lazy and unwilling to work, causing him to be laid off from the factory. With no income and a long period of idleness, the family was in dire straits, and he often forced his wife to borrow money from her family. If she occasionally failed to do so, she would be beaten. A few days ago, Xu Jinfang again asked his wife to borrow money from her mother's family. Because she was slow to respond, she was severely beaten. Xu Zheng thought she had married the wrong person, lamented her misfortune, and felt that life was worse than death. Yesterday afternoon around 1 PM, she jumped into the river at the Mud Ferry Pier in Pudong to commit suicide. A police officer noticed her and quickly called a boat to rescue her. They found an oilcloth package near the woman, which contained a letter of complaint. (The content is omitted). She was sent to the Tangqiao Police Station, where the above facts were investigated. A document was prepared and sent to the General Bureau for verification.

### Rickshaw Driver Conspires to Kidnap a Young Master; Case Concluded

Police Lawyer Requests Severe Punishment; Court Schedules Sentencing for the 19th

Yang Rongfu, a Wuxi native and owner of the Dayu Porcelain Shop at 130 Quai du Mail, French Concession, had his six-year-old son, Huiqi, kidnapped and hidden by Cai Fu, the hired rickshaw driver, and Shen, his accomplice, on January 27th of this year at 10 AM. They demanded 3,000 yuan for ransom. Yang agreed to pay 1,000 yuan as ransom, but when he went to pay, no one appeared to receive the money, so the matter was delayed. Later, Zhang Yun嘅, a tailor, found out and falsely claimed to be a kidnapper.

Posing as the Kidnapper

He sent a letter to Yang, demanding 1,000 yuan and arranged to meet at the Zhongnan Hotel to receive the ransom. Yang, fearing it was a trap, reported it to the French Concession police, who arrested Zhang and investigated. This led to the arrest of the kidnappers Cai Fuxing, Wu Jinshu, Shi Dehong, and suspect Chen Shoupeng. After investigation by the Special Second Court, the kidnappers, realizing that the main perpetrators had been caught, sent the hostage Yang Huiqi back home safely. After a thorough investigation by the French Concession police, Chen Shouming and Shi Dehong, who were not involved in the case, were released. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution against Cai Fuxing and Wu Jinshu for extortion, and against Zhang Yunxiang for intimidation and fraud. Judge Chen Shuoying conducted repeated hearings, summoned the victim to court, and appointed a defense lawyer for further hearings. This newspaper has previously reported on these events. Yesterday morning at 10 AM, Judge Chen presided over the continued hearing in Criminal Court One. The victim, Yang Rongfu's wife, Yang Ma氏,

Brought the Victim

Yang Huiqi, the hostage, to court. After the court questioned him about the kidnapping, Cai and Wu confessed to conspiring to kidnap and extort the ransom. Zhang Yunqing also admitted to impersonating the kidnapper to commit fraud. The court, finding the evidence clear, opened the debate. The police lawyer Fei Xizhen argued that the first defendant had worked for the victim's family for over a year and should have

Protected the Young Master

Instead, he conspired with the first defendant to kidnap and extort the ransom. He should be given the most severe punishment to serve as a warning. The other defendants should also be severely punished according to the law. After the defendants' pro bono lawyer made their defense, the court declared the debate closed and scheduled sentencing for 9 AM on the 19th. The defendants were remanded in custody.

### Chinese Ratepayers Association Writes to the Shanghai Municipal Council Not to Obstruct Legitimate Requests

The Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association sent a letter to the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "According to a letter from lawyer Wang Xintang, our clients Zhou Peizhang and Zhou Peifu stated that they jointly own a Hua Hu (Chinese household) deed for land at No. 241, Chen Ziwei, 12 Tu, 13 Bao, Yinxiang District, totaling 3.783 mu (approximately 0.6 acres) (formerly known as Heilong Road, also known as Helong Road, currently known as Hangzhou Road, south of Qing Road, east of the land). In 1935, it was leased to the Wufeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory. Now, the Wufeng Factory intends to construct buildings on the land and applied to the Shanghai Municipal Council for a construction permit. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council delayed issuing the permit, citing that our client had not paid land tax, which affects our client's income. This is unusual. This land has been paying grain and taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau for years. Since it is not a deed, why should it be required to pay land tax? We feel this request is inappropriate. Should Chinese people's private land, in addition to fulfilling the obligation to pay taxes to the Chinese government, also be subject to extra burdens to the concession authorities? Nothing could be more inappropriate. If this precedent is set, all Chinese-owned lands in the concession that wish to build houses will be subject to the control of the Shanghai Municipal Council. How can the government protect the integrity of the people's sovereignty? We specially request that the Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association seriously negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Council and immediately issue the construction permit. We await your favorable reply." The Association states, "According to legal principles, it is clear that the deed land has no obligation to pay land tax to your bureau. Building on the land is not under the jurisdiction of your bureau. Applying to your bureau for a construction permit is a matter of courtesy. Whether or not the permit is issued has no legal impact. As for access to the deed land, the right of way is publicly recognized and should not be obstructed in any way. Otherwise, it would be an illegal act." In light of the above, we request that your bureau treat the matter with courtesy within the bounds of the law.

### National Goods Factory Joint Meeting

The Shanghai National Goods Factory Union held its 15th regular meeting yesterday, chaired by Lu Xingzhuang. The following matters were resolved: ⑴ Regarding the dispute at the Yongliang Electric Factory, the two committee members, Shi Jiuyun and Zhou Shixuan, who were previously appointed to investigate, only saw two sets of accounts from the factory, those of 1924 and 1936, which listed capital accounts. The factory will be asked to submit the general clearance books and cash flow records for 1935 within three days to determine whether it is a fully Chinese-owned capital. ⑵ The factories participating in the Hangzhou Goods Exhibition were notified to load and depart on the 18th of this month. Other matters were also discussed.

### After Dissolving Engagement, the Woman's Family Sues for Losses

The Man and Woman Met and Socialized Repeatedly; Unexpectedly, the Man Changed His Mind Over Time

Chen Quanfa, a local resident of 584 Haifang Road, betrothed his 18-year-old daughter Chen Lingdi to Gu Mingguan, the son of Gu Genfa, the former general manager of the Nanyang Automobile Company at 57, Lane 88, Changping Road, through a matchmaker in 1928. Many years have passed, but they have not yet married. Last year, Mingguan, feeling that he was an adult and dissatisfied with the marriage arranged by his parents, filed a petition with the Special First Court to dissolve the engagement, which was approved. Now, Chen Quanfa has also hired lawyer Pan Zhe to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Special First Court against Gu Genfa and Gu Mingguan, father and son, seeking compensation for material and emotional losses, and requesting litigation assistance. The case was heard yesterday morning in Civil Court Seven by Judge Xu Gongdian, who was presiding over the case. Chen Quanfa testified that his daughter Lingdi was betrothed to Gu Mingguan in 1928. At the beginning of the matchmaking process, he knew that the poor and rich were not a good match and wanted to refuse. However, Gu Genfa believed that those from poor backgrounds were better because they could endure hardship and be thrifty and not extravagant, so he insisted on having his daughter as a daughter-in-law, and he agreed. Later, Gu was fortunate in speculative business and became a wealthy man in Shanghai, while he was unemployed and fell into poverty, leading to Gu's contempt. The most painful thing was that the defendant had long harbored other intentions, but on the surface, he not only did not make it clear early on, but also deliberately insisted on socializing with his daughter first to observe her personality, causing his daughter to accompany Mingguan to watch movies, visit parks, and even do unreasonable things. She dared not speak, like swallowing a bitter gourd. Unexpectedly, the defendant changed his mind and sued for dissolution of the engagement. Since the approval, she has suffered deeply and attempted suicide several times. At the time of the engagement, he also lost more than 900 yuan in banquets and other expenses. At the same time, he requested a judgment ordering compensation, etc. The defendant also hired a lawyer to appear in court and request the dismissal of the plaintiff's lawsuit, arguing that according to Shanghai customs, no banquets were held at the time of the engagement, so there were no losses. Moreover, the defendant had never met the plaintiff's daughter, etc. After the lawyers of both parties debated, the court adjourned the hearing to the 19th.

### After the Death of Yao Yinsun, Manager of Lao Jie Fu, Granddaughter Disputes Inheritance

Inheriting on Behalf of Mother Under Current Law; The Facts of the Case Were Investigated After Yesterday's Summons

Yao Yinsun, a shareholder and manager of the Lao Jie Fu Silk Shop on Nanjing Road, Anhui Province, died of illness on July 30 last year, leaving behind a considerable fortune. He had one son and one daughter. His son, Zuiting, married a woman of the Hu family, who bore him a son, Kecheng, and two daughters, Luyun and Biyun. His daughter married into the Huang family and gave birth to three daughters, Huang Xiuqin, Suqin, and Qiqin. As Yao Yinsun's son Zuiting and daughter Huang Yao氏 both died before Yao Yinsun,

All Inheritance

Was inherited by his daughter-in-law Yao Hu氏 and her children. However, Yao Yinsun's granddaughter, Huang Xiuqin, stated that although her mother had died, according to current law, a granddaughter can inherit her maternal family's property on behalf of her mother. Therefore, she hired lawyers Gao Junxiang and Zhao Chuanding to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against her cousins Yao Kecheng, Yao Luyun, and Yao Biyun, seeking a division of the inheritance. Because the Yao siblings are

Still Minors

Yao Hu氏 was listed as the legal representative. According to their investigation, their maternal grandfather Yao Yinsun left the following properties: ⑴ One-third of the houses in Yongyu Lane and Xianglin Lane, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, Shanghai. ⑵ Real estate in Wucheng Town and Qiaoyang Town, South Xiang, Xiuning, Anhui Province, worth about 40,000 yuan. ⑶ A five-bay, three-courtyard house in Wucheng Zhong Street, with an empty plot of land of about one and a half mu. ⑷ A two-bay, two-courtyard house and a tea garden in Wucheng Yangjia Lane. ⑸

Six bays on Wucheng Zhong Street

Shop houses at the entrance of the pawnshop lane. ⑹ Farmland and real estate in Jiucheng Town and Qiaoyang Town. ⑺ A deposit of 40,000 yuan in the Jintai Qianzhuang in Shanghai. ⑻ A deposit of 40,000 yuan in the Lao Jie Fu Silk Shop. ⑼ 30,000 yuan in Lao Jie Fu shares. (10) 1,000 yuan in shares of the Silk Industry Bank. (11) 1,800 yuan in shares of the Xianghua Electric Company. (12) 500 yuan in shares of the Hongchang Air Conditioning Company. (13) All movable properties in the Yinsun Mansion at No. 7 Zhenyu Lane, Haining Road, Shanghai, etc. According to the above investigation, the plaintiff is legally entitled to

One-sixth

Of the inheritance. Please order the allocation of the plaintiff's inheritance for management. The case was heard yesterday in the Civil Court Seven of the Special Court by Judge Xu Taiyu. The defendants also hired lawyers Zhu Chuanbi and Zhang Zhengxue to appear in court on their behalf, and Yao Hu氏 also appeared in court. According to her defense, at the time of the plaintiff's mother's death, there were no laws on female inheritance. Before his death, Yinsun had made a will stipulating that each granddaughter would receive 2,000 yuan upon marriage, and the remainder would be inherited by the grandson. Therefore, the plaintiff's request is

Difficult to Accept

Moreover, the estate of Mr. Yin is not as large as the plaintiff claims. There is only 10,000 yuan in shares of the Wuhua Silk Factory, 1,800 yuan in shares of the Hankou Water and Electricity Company, 1,000 yuan in shares of the Yuhua Real Estate Company, houses on Yangshi Street, Hangzhou, worth about 1,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan in savings in the Silk Industry Bank, 4,000 yuan in loans from Chen Shilan, a five-bay, two-courtyard house in Wucheng, and two other houses, 80 dan of grain fields, etc. There are no savings or shares in Lao Jie Fu, etc. The court believed that the case still needed to be investigated and adjourned the hearing.

### Large Number of Japanese Smuggling Copper Coins for Export

Japanese Newspaper Considers It Dishonorable

The Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News reported that recently, the price of copper has soared, and the smuggling of copper coins has occurred frequently. On the morning of the 15th, the Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru was about to export. A Japanese person secretly carried 130 yuan in copper coins, weighing about 500 pounds, onto the ship. There were dozens of others who also secretly carried many copper coins. All were discovered by customs inspectors and police. After being reprimanded, they shamefully disembarked. This kind of speculative behavior not only brings dishonor to law-abiding Japanese people in Shanghai but also indirectly affects Sino-Japanese trade.

### Hunan Steamer Rescues Abducted Young Woman

Zhang A Yuan rescued midway, Investigator exposes the abductor

Zhang A Yuan, a young woman from Kunshan, is 18 years old and still has a pretty face. Her father died early, and her mother lives in her original home of Lujia Bang, struggling as a farmer. Last December, A Yuan came to Shanghai alone and lived in her cousin's house at No. 41 Xinping Lane, Longmen Road, in the Public Concession. A week ago, she happened to go to the Yong'an Company's theater to watch a play, where she met two unknown men. One was over forty years old, and the other was only in his twenties. The younger one saw that A Yuan was alone and gradually started chatting with her, showing great concern. A Yuan was indeed captivated. The three left the theater and went out for dinner. The older man also coaxed and seduced her. As a result, A Yuan went with the younger man to the older man's house in the Baxianqiao area of the French Concession and spent the night. The younger man claimed to have a clothing store in Tianjin and was willing to marry her. With sweet words and promises, A Yuan's heart was moved. Soon, the young man pretended to say goodbye to return to Tianjin, and the older man volunteered, very willing to help with the good deed, claiming that his name was Zhang A Da, and the young man was a wealthy friend. This time he came to Shanghai for business, and he could act as a matchmaker to accompany her to Tianjin to get married and live together. A Yuan, at this point, thought of her own lonely life, and having such a husband, she happily agreed. She stayed at Zhang A Da's house for four or five days, and they agreed to go to the Taikoo Company's Beiyang Line Hunan steamer at the Bund in the French Concession at 9 am yesterday, accompanied by Zhang, to take the steerage to Tianjin. Zhang then went ashore to buy goods on eight names, taking the opportunity to hide. As the ship was about to set sail, it happened that Chen Shao Ting and Lin Yong Fang, investigators from the China Relief Association for Women and Children, together with Wang Hai Quan and other three detectives from the Customs Water Police Station, boarded the ship to investigate. They saw that A Yuan's demeanor was suspicious and asked where she was going. A Yuan said she was going to Tianjin to find her brother. The detectives asked again where her brother lived. A Yuan stared blankly and could not answer, only taking out a piece of paper given by Zhang, on which was written No. 1, Yiwan Lane, 31st Road, French Concession, Tianjin. At this point, the detectives knew that she had been abducted, but she was still infatuated and unaware. They asked who she was going with. A Yuan replied, Zhang A Da. The detectives knew that Zhang A Da was a famous old abductor, so they immediately searched the entire ship to arrest him, but he had already hidden. So they took her back to the police station and explained the situation repeatedly. A Yuan finally realized and was deeply regretful. According to her confession, the detectives rushed to the French Concession to arrest Zhang A Da, but could not find him. The police chief ordered Zhang A Yuan to be handed over to the Relief Association to be cared for while waiting for her mother to claim her, and ordered a strict search for the abductor to be brought to justice.

### Husband Favors Concubine, Wife Commits Suicide Out of Jealousy

Feng Cen Shi, a woman from Guangdong, was 34 years old. Her husband, Feng Cu Ming, worked as a railway police officer. He also had a concubine, and the three lived together at No. 25, Lane 521, Bazi Road. Initially, they lived in peace, but recently the concubine returned to her hometown in Guangdong and had been gone for over a hundred days. She only came to Shanghai a week ago. Feng showed even more affection for her and treated his wife coldly. On the evening of the 14th of this month, Cen Shi became jealous and had an argument with her husband. By the next morning, she was extremely frustrated and suddenly had the thought of ending her life. She secretly went out and bought a bottle of poison, and after returning home, she swallowed it and committed suicide behind people's backs. After her family discovered it, they immediately accompanied her to Shanghai Liaoyang Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and she soon died. The hospital reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, which ordered Detective Chen Xi Kang to go to investigate. He then carried the body to the Philan Road Morgue for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, Inspector Tang, commissioned by the First Special Court, arrived at the morgue and confirmed the body. He then instructed the deceased's husband, Feng Zhong Ming, to collect the body for burial.

### Young Woman Sues for Divorce, Judge Recommends Reconciliation

Chen Wang Gui Juan, a young woman from Dinghai, is 20 years old this year. Two years ago, she was married to Chen Gen Fa in her hometown through a matchmaker. Recently, she hired Lawyer Shi Dao of Huyan Road and filed a petition for divorce with the Civil Court of the District Court. The petition stated that the plaintiff had lost her parents at a young age and was raised by her aunt through hard work. When she grew up, she was fortunate enough to find work and live frugally. Her mother listened to the Chen family's deception and promised the plaintiff to the defendant as his first wife. The plaintiff deeply appreciated having a place to call home after drifting through life, so after marrying into the Chen family two years ago, she did her best as a wife. However, the defendant was fond of wandering and spent his days seeking pleasure outside. The plaintiff repeatedly advised him, but was instead beaten. Her in-laws also protected their son. During the first month of the lunar calendar last year, because the defendant's demands were not met, she was beaten and injured by the defendant and her in-laws. The neighbors were indignant and sent the plaintiff to the Red Cross for treatment. The in-laws went to the hospital and refused to allow the plaintiff to return home. Left with no choice, she returned home to her mother. Unexpectedly, the defendant and others hired a lawyer to send a letter accusing the plaintiff of running away and threatened her. The mother and daughter were timid and dared not resist. Just when they were in a hurry, the defendant suddenly realized he was in the wrong and asked someone to persuade the plaintiff to return home, promising not to abuse her again. The plaintiff then returned home, but soon it became even worse. She silently endured the hardship and pain, hoping to win him back. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 27th of last month, the mother-in-law suddenly came to the plaintiff's room when no one was home and tried to assault her. The plaintiff refused to submit at the cost of her life, which angered her. She instead incited the defendant to accuse the plaintiff of improper behavior and locked the plaintiff in the room. The plaintiff wanted to commit suicide, but could not bear to leave her elderly mother, so she found a way to write a letter and mail it to the post office, asking her mother for help. On January 30th of this year, the mother arrived and found the plaintiff still locked in the room. The mother opened the door and rescued her to her residence. The defendant then gathered several gangsters to the residence, broke down the door, and beat them without asking questions. The mother and daughter screamed for help. The owner of the residence heard this and called the police. The defendant and others had already fled. The French police sent the plaintiff and her mother to Guangci Hospital for treatment and arrested the defendant's father, transferring him to the Second Special Court. As a result, he was fined 100 yuan. The plaintiff thought that she had been married to the defendant for less than two years, and the suffering she had endured was unspeakable. The days ahead were long, and her life was in danger. Therefore, she filed for divorce and requested alimony of 495 yuan. After receiving the petition, the court, at 3 pm that afternoon, convened a court session presided over by Judge Wang to summon and question them. The plaintiff, Chen Wang Gui Juan, and her agent lawyer arrived in court to testify about the past. The defendant, Chen Gen Fa, arrived in court and testified that he was 20 years old, from Dinghai, and lived at No. 24, Nancaojiazhai, Kainalu Road, and worked as a cook. He also testified that he did not abuse her. The plaintiff originally worked as a helper in a foreigner's house. After she married me, I did not allow her to continue doing that job, so she was not on good terms with me and often used excuses to return to her natal home for several months. I advised her, but she argued with me. Unexpectedly, she fabricated accusations that I teased her, hoping to achieve her wishes. I do not want a divorce and request to live together. The judge obtained the testimony and considered that the jurisdiction of this case was still in question. It was best to invite relatives and friends to mediate and reconcile the parties. Both parties listened to the advice and left the court.

### A Japanese Man Comes to Shanghai, Loses His Job, and Spends His Days Living and Eating for Free

According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily, Sanosuke Yubino, a 26-year-old from Yuasa Town, Arida District, Wakayama Prefecture, came to Shanghai from Zhifu on February 17 to find a job with his friend's aunt. Unexpectedly, the person he was looking for was "missing." He pleaded with the Japanese Consul General to introduce him to a job. On the 5th of this month, he stayed at the Qiujiang Road Baode Lane Qiujiang Hotel. Because he was penniless and had no money to pay the bill, the hotel expelled him. He was forced to wander the streets and alleys. However, driven by hunger, he entered the Guangcheng Restaurant next to the Shanghai Grand Theater on North Sichuan Road. After eating his fill, he tried to escape, but the store chased him out and called the police, who brought him to the police station and extradited him to the Consul General's office. After being reprimanded by the Consul General, he was sent to the Yishuan Relief Center.

### The Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau Sends Personnel to Anhui for Investigation

Zheng Bao Zhao, Director of the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, was dispatched by the Ministry to Guangdong Province a month ago to investigate the rice shortage situation.

He has been quite active in the Bureau's affairs.

### Haiheng Breaks a Rowboat

Two Passengers Die

The Haiheng steamer, operated by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on the Hong Kong-Shanghai route, arrived in Shanghai at 7:30 the night before. While passing through the Pudong Yangjing Port outside the Huangpu River, it collided with a rowboat numbered 847, which was carrying three passengers across the river from Pudong. The two sides could not avoid each other, and the rowboat was cut in two. The four passengers and boatmen all fell into the river. Nearby boatmen rushed to rescue them. In the darkness, they only rescued boatman Liu Cheng He and Zhang Li Shi, an elderly woman from Gaoyou, and one passenger. They quickly pulled him up, but he had already suffocated from drinking too much water and died. One passenger was still missing. After the accident, the Haiheng continued to the Jinliyuan Wharf at the 16th pier to dock. The Customs Water Police Station dispatched Detective Li Wen Qi to investigate after the accident. He saw that the body that was pulled up was wearing a black fake serge camel hair robe, black maoge pants, coffee-colored socks, and shoes had fallen off. He had a flat top and was about thirty years old. There was a leather wallet beside him containing a pawn ticket worth three yuan and two letters from home addressed to her husband, Sen Lin, from someone named Li Ai Lian. The first letter briefly stated that the family's needs were urgent and asked her husband to review the payment immediately. The second letter said that the five yuan had been received and urged her husband to work hard in Shanghai and take care of his health. Two pieces of luggage were also recovered, containing a gray fake serge jacket, a black-gray guige pants, a white health shirt, a white shorts, and a gray fake serge short shirt. The missing passenger was identified as Liu Guang Li, a 30-year-old from Yangzhou, living at No. 92, North Yangjing Road, Pudong, making a living by making shoes. This small shoemaker also died in the Huangpu River. His only relative was his cousin Liu Guang Jin, and he had no wife or children. The detective verified the case and brought the boatman Liu Cheng He and the unidentified corpse to the police station. According to Liu, he was 61 years old, from Shandong, and lived alone, living on the rowboat day and night. He was still shirking responsibility for the accident. The police chief determined that the case involved human lives and sentenced him to the District Court for disposition. The corpse was taken to the Salvation Bureau for examination and was prepared with a coffin and stored, waiting for family members to claim it.

### Hu Yunhai Falls into Huangpu River and Dies

Worker Angered by Cruel Foreman, Water Police Station Sends to Court

At 8 pm the night before, the Changjiang-class Jiangxin steamer docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was loading cargo. A worker named Hu Yunhai was carrying a bag of sugar from the outer iron barge onto the ship along the gangplank. At that time, the foreman Lin Jin Lai, blocked Hu because the workers on the ship did not have time to stack it. Lin instructed him to delay boarding. Unexpectedly, Hu suddenly fell into the Huangpu River and could not be rescued, resulting in a tragic death. The body sank without a trace. At the time, co-workers Chen Zheng Yang, Liu Jia Bao, Zhao Ji Cai, and others believed that Lin pushed him too hard, causing the accident, so they started fighting, accusing Lin of being too fierce. They twisted him and beat him. Another foreman, Tong Zhi Yu, persuaded them to stop. Chen and others reported to the Xiaodongmen French Police Station and arrested Lin. After questioning, it was determined that the case occurred on the water, so yesterday morning, they notified the Customs Water Police Station, which sent Detective Jin Gui Fu to take the witnesses back for questioning. The defendant, Lin Jin Lai, denied pushing hard. The police chief determined that the case involved human lives and summoned a new witness, Cui Xiao Wu Zi, and together with all the witnesses, was sent to the District Court for questioning yesterday afternoon. It is said that the deceased was fifteen years old, from Anhui. His family only had his elderly mother, Wang, and the situation was extremely tragic.

### Abandoned After Seduction, Defendant Accused of Obscenity

Yan Xiu Lan, a local woman living on Yongxing Road and Deli in Zhabei, is 29 years old, beautiful, and still unmarried. Last summer, Zhao Ji Ren (also known as Zhang Gen), the young owner of the Zhao De Ji hemp rope shop located at No. 64, Hongfu Lane, Xinzha Road, saw her and was amazed by her beauty. He immediately pursued her and eventually seduced her with sweet words. They opened Room 5 in the Baoshan Hotel for a tryst. After their passionate affair, they agreed to marry her, and a lucky day was chosen for the wedding. Unexpectedly, the beautiful scene did not last long. The two were together for only six months when Zhao suddenly fell in love with someone else and forgot his old love. After Yan Xiu Lan found out, she repeatedly negotiated with Zhao to fulfill the marriage contract, but Zhao avoided her. She finally realized that she had been deceived and told her mother, Yan Zhu Shi, the whole story. Her beloved daughter's innocence was tarnished, and she suffered the pain of being abandoned after seduction. Her lifelong happiness was lost. Extremely angry, she, in the capacity of her daughter's legal representative, hired Lawyer Yang Xun to file a lawsuit in the First Special District District Court, accusing Zhao Ji Ren of obscenity. After the Special District Court reviewed the case, it determined that the crime scene was located in the Chinese territory, so it transferred the case to the Nanshi District Court for handling. At 10 am yesterday morning, Judge Lu Hong Yi presided over the court session. The plaintiff, Yan Zhu Shi, accompanied by her daughter Yan Xiu Lan and their representative lawyer, arrived in court to testify about the past and requested a strict investigation. The judge obtained the testimony. Because the defendant Zhao Ji Ren did not arrive, he ordered a postponement for another hearing.

### Omega Waterproof Watch Arrives in Shanghai

The world-famous Omega watch factory's invention of waterproof watches has now arrived in Shanghai, managed by Baoxin Foreign Company at No. 3210, Jiangxi Road. This waterproof watch has been rigorously tested by the Geneva Municipal Authority. An Omega waterproof watch, two empty watch cases, and three other types of waterproof watches were boiled in boiling water at F188 degrees for five minutes, then placed in the Geneva River at a depth of 2210 feet (C5 degrees) and taken out after half an hour. As a result, the Omega waterproof watch kept accurate time and no water leaked in. The other watches were damaged and could not be used.

### Shanghai Race Club Regularly Holds Joint Competitions

The Shanghai Race Club, in view of the Jiangwan International Sports Association's decision to cancel its annual competition originally scheduled for the 27th, 28th, and 29th of this month and the 1st of April, decided that it would be a waste of the good spring weather to not take advantage of the good times. It is now scheduled to hold an Easter joint competition on the 27th, 29th of this month and the 3rd of April to make up for the deficiency. The program is special and full of excitement, such as two joint new horse races each day, one joint grand competition on the second day, and one joint champagne race on the third day. It is stipulated that those who occupy the top two or three positions during the race period are qualified to be selected for the champagne race. In addition, in the old horse handicap race, those who have won more than 5,500 yuan in prizes last year are not allowed to participate, which is particularly novel. Therefore, even the good horses that are sure to win the championship have to withdraw and give way, so the lesser horses have a chance to exhale. It is also a good strategy to equalize the winning rights of each horse.

This Saturday is the Shanghai Race Club's second special competition. The program is roughly the same as before. After studying the races from last Saturday, it is not difficult for researchers to follow the clues.

### Modern Politics and China (Continued)

— Junshan

In today's countries, whether they appear to be democratic or monarchical, their essence is nothing more than the rule of law and party rule. This fact also illustrates that no country today can be separated from group rule politics and leader politics. What does this mean? Because today the whole world has only sixty-two countries, thirty-seven are republics, and twenty-five are kingdoms. And we usually only see eight major countries, namely: England, America, Japan, Soviet Russia, France, Italy, Turkey, and Germany. So without looking at how other countries' political forms and political essence are, we can see everything by taking these eight major countries as representatives. Everyone should know that the world has a total population of 1.8 billion to 2 billion. These eight countries rule 1.1 billion people - if we add China, there are more than 1.5 billion people. Therefore, we can get the truth of modern world politics by using this as a representative. Among the eight major countries, some are democratic republics, and some are constitutional monarchies, but whether their external form is monarchy or democracy, the essence of their politics is either group rule politics or leader politics. For example, in monarchical countries, England and Japan are group rule politics - party politics, that is, multi-party politics, while Italy is leader politics - one-party politics. But if we look at democratic countries, we can also find group rule politics and leader politics. Like the United States and France, this is group rule politics under democratic politics: while Russia and Germany are leader politics under democratic politics. Therefore, we can find the same group rule politics and leader politics from these two very different political forms - democratic politics can produce group rule politics and leader politics, and monarchical politics also produces group rule politics and leader politics. This shows that modern politics has no distinction between monarchy and democracy, only the difference between group rule politics and leader politics: that is, the difference between multi-party politics and one-party politics. What is multi-party politics? It means that many political parties manage a country's politics by waxing and waning each other. What is one-party politics? It means that only one political party manages the politics of a country. Understanding this meaning means understanding the trend of world politics, which is very important.

Over 1,000 Bales of Gray Cloth Transacted

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market, because foreign cotton and tender yarn rose sharply together, the market atmosphere was very strong.

Therefore, yesterday's transactions of spot and forward goods reached more than 1,500 bales, and the spot goods in the hands of colleagues and scattered households had already been cut empty, and all went to Japanese firms to cover their positions. In total, it is estimated that about 3,000 pieces of forward fine cloth and fine twill for May, June, and July were sold. The selling price was raised by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan per piece. The light-colored printed satin and various grades of plain colored silk from this factory continued to see active sales. The price of printed satin rose by about 0.1 yuan per piece. Market sentiment was firm, and various provinces also added many scattered purchases.

### Securities

Government Bonds Remain Relatively Firm

Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw market conditions still revolving, the trend becoming increasingly sluggish, the bulls and bears holding firm, not giving way at all. Each session held between 0.05 and 0.1 yuan. Only 96 continued to worsen, although each session was only down 0.05 yuan, 14 and 35 were both selling, and there was a gradual spitting out trend.

Foreign wheat quotations, Chicago rose by 0.6 to 1.0 yuan, Canada rose by 1.0 to 1.2 yuan, and Liverpool rose by 12 pence, etc. After the opening price, because foreign wheat rose sharply, the market sentiment naturally tended to be strong. The opening prices for March and April were about 0.02 yuan better. With the sharp rise in foreign wheat, the flour market only improved by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan. The reason for this is not difficult to guess. This month will soon need to be delivered, and the actual sales market is still scattered, with no wholesale packaging. Therefore, in the stability of various months, it is still difficult to rebound. Until the afternoon opening, the actual demand did not move, and there was slight sales, and the receiving party still waited and watched, causing the asking price to soften again. July and August, because the factory did not issue, the bulls pulled up, and it was good by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan. The recent period was only good by 0.005 yuan, and April had no change. In the midst of rising foreign wheat quotations, the market showed this desolate phenomenon, which is rare in recent times.

Foreign Sesame Breaks the Dull Situation

--Soybean Trend Softens--

Foreign sesame, because the foreign situation is ordinary, the purchase appetite is not greedy, but the oil price is firm and exceptionally high, and the owners are unwilling to sell lightly, resulting in a long stalemate. A few days ago, Dafu Foreign Firm came to the market to ask, and 200 tons were negotiated. The price was adjusted by the owners to 14.5 yuan. The current trend has broken the lonely situation, and if the purchase appetite is flexible in the future, the market will not easily fall. The soybean trend is slightly softened, so the outbound route takes the opportunity to move, but it still does not break away from the revolving pattern. Yesterday, it is estimated that the oil mill traded 6 or 7 cars of Yingzhou beans, 3 cars of Bengbu beans, and this street Wenzhou, etc. purchased more than 1,000 bags of Hankou Zha beans, and more than 300 bags of Jiujiang Chi beans, and 500 or 600 bags of Du bean sand yellow.

Chinese Tea Sales to the United States are Declining

--The American Stock Exchange Stops the Chinese Tea Auction--

Chinese tea's trade with the United States has a long history. In the past, black tea from Qimen and Ningzhou in the two lakes, and green tea from Wuyuan Pingshui, were transported to the Americas every year, no less than 150,000 or 160,000 boxes. Now it has been sharply reduced to 37,000 or 38,000 boxes. The reason for this is that the sales of tea from Ceylon, Japan, and Taiwan have expanded. Recently, the American Commodities Exchange market, because Chinese tea is not pure in quality and the standards are uncertain, decided to stop the auction, and the sales of Taiwanese tea are increasing, there is news of joining the auction. From now on, the reputation of Chinese tea in the United States will decline even more, and the future is worrying.

Spring and Autumn

### Relying On

——(Chen Tianci)

"At home, rely on your parents; when you're away, rely on your friends." "Rely on the mountain to eat the mountain, rely on the water to eat the water."

These two sentences are common sayings circulating among our people, but upon careful thought, these words are fundamentally wrong. Why?

Because "At home, rely on your parents," if his parents die, who will he rely on? "When you're away, rely on your friends," if his friends don't promote him or pay attention to him, who else will he rely on?

"Rely on the mountain to eat the mountain, rely on the water to eat the water." That's even more incorrect. If he doesn't have a specific skill, what will he rely on to eat the mountain and eat the water?

The reason why our national character is so backward now is that these two idioms have had a considerable impact, leading to a sense of dependence and a lack of the ability to strive.

In short, if we want to survive in society and consolidate our position, we must strive, struggle, and create. We must learn a specific skill. Relying on this empty concept of "relying" is useless. Friends! Let us rise up. The bright future is right before us, waiting for us to develop it!

### Impressions of General Fu Zuoyi

— Bai Xia

The bandit suppression army in Suiyuan is divided into several routes: the commander of the First Route Army is General Fu Zuoyi, whose mission is to protect the security of Sui Bei (North Suiyuan) and Sui Xi (West Suiyuan). At the same time, General Fu is also the overall commander of the bandit suppression army, and all the powers of resisting the enemy in Suiyuan are in his hands, making him arguably the most important figure on the Sui border.

When the author went to Suiyuan, I stayed in the only Suiyuan Hotel in Suiyuan. On the same day, I went to the liaison section of the provincial government to visit Section Chief Yang, asking him to introduce me to General Fu. Section Chief Yang said, "Chairman Fu has important official duties today and cannot receive guests. Leave your calling card here, and we will notify you tomorrow when the Chairman is free." Around four o'clock the next afternoon, I returned to the hotel from outside. The attendant said to me, "The director of the reception office of the provincial government just sent a car to pick you up to go to the provincial government, but you were not at the hotel." After listening to the phone, I immediately called the director of the reception office and asked him if Chairman Fu was still at the provincial government. The reply was, "He has already gone to the general headquarters. But the Chairman is hosting a banquet at the Suiyuan Hotel tonight, and you are also invited, so won't you be able to meet him tonight?" After hanging up the phone, I returned to my room and indeed found an invitation card on the table.

Representatives who came to the front line to offer condolences, and reporters who came to cover war zone news, would usually be invited by General Fu to a Western-style dinner. Those invited that night included overseas Chinese condolence representatives, the political minister of the reformed bandit army, Miss Li Fuying, the daughter of Li Fuying, the commander of the Third Route Army of the bandit suppression army, and the author, totaling about a dozen people. General Fu arrived at the dining room of the Suiyuan Hotel promptly at six o'clock. Being able to meet such a national hero admired by the whole country, needless to say, the author's heart was filled with joy. However, on this night, General Fu took off his military uniform and only wore a black cloth-faced leather robe, with a Parker fountain pen clipped to the upper lapel. He didn't look like a general at all, but more like a university professor.

General Fu's demeanor was very relaxed and amiable. The initial impression he gave was that of an extremely approachable elder. When he pointed to Miss Li and said to us, "The times are different now. Girls of seventeen or eighteen already know how to love their country and brave the wind and snow to go to Bailing Temple to offer condolences, fearing nothing. This is something we never expected. When I was this age, I would have been scared as soon as I heard the word 'war,' how could I have had such courage?" At this time, General Fu turned into a rural elder, filled with sincere and lovable feelings.

After this banquet, I had more opportunities to meet with General Fu. Especially on the day when Suiyuan held a major air defense conference, on the podium of the small drill ground, this amiable elder transformed into a heroic general. Not only did his gray military uniform make him appear brave and great, but also his loud voice, decisive words, and impassioned attitude all showed that he was an inviolable national hero!

### Quail Fights

— Li Ping

The quail's shape resembles a hen chick, with short legs and a bald tail, grayish-brown in color with black spots. During the day, it hides in the grass and cannot fly high. Quail hunters use pigeons to catch them during the day, but at night, quails can fly high in the sky, so nets are used to catch them. However, there are very few males. Only a few out of a hundred are males. Male quails are good at fighting, often able to last for two hours during a match. Therefore, residents in the western Hunan area use this as the most common game and gambling activity.

When a male quail is caught, it is not kept in a cage, but is placed in a cloth bag with a round wooden piece as the base and hung on the head of the bed. When going out, it is tucked into the waistband. Newly caught quails cannot fight immediately because they are too fat. Therefore, they are only fed three times a day, with millet and other grains. After eating, they are given a bath with hot, strong tea. After washing, they are put back into the cloth bag after their feathers dry. After half a month of this, they become both healthy and thin, and this quail is qualified to go to the battlefield.

Before the fight, the quail owner discusses everything with the opponent. Then, quails of similar shape and strength are chosen and placed in the quail fighting arena - a low bamboo fence enclosure. They then advance, retreat, and circle, fighting non-stop. During the fight, they peck at each other or use their wings to strike. Good quails can fight for about a thousand pecks, lasting about two hours, before a winner is determined. It is said that quail experts can tell the quality of a quail at a glance. Good qualities include sharp pecks, strong wings, bright eyes, and a forehead as flat as a swallow. Once a quail loses, it cannot fight again unless it is exceptionally good, in which case it can only be nurtured and then fight again. Otherwise, it is thrown to the ground and killed, to be used as food.

### The Tomb of Lady Xi

— Tao Kangjun

Indeed, this is a very powerful legend, deeply imprinted on the minds of every Nanjing resident. Therefore, we often hear a ballad-like saying: "Dig up Lady Xi's tomb, and you can make half of Nanjing rich," which is popular among every Nanjing resident. How tempting is that! Undoubtedly, it grabs people's thoughts and touches their heartstrings.

Indeed, according to the "Jinling Miscellaneous Records," Lady Xi, the empress of Emperor Wu of Liang, was buried east of Nanshan and next to Louhutou. Based on this record, we can know that Lady Xi's tomb is located near the ancient city walls.

There are no old trees or lush forests beside Louhutou, but there are mounds of desolate graves and withered grass everywhere. However, those who visit seeking the name of Lady Xi's tomb have no way to inquire, and those who are interested have no way to find it.

Several years ago, due to a prolonged drought, local farmers used the excuse of digging a pond to gather dozens of people, all with the hope of getting rich, and carried out their development work. However, after spending more than a month, they only obtained more than 90,000 ancient bricks with patterns, and nothing else, which made them feel greatly disappointed.

According to the elders, the construction of this tomb was extremely vast, and the glutinous rice juice used reached thousands of dan (a unit of weight). Even if the real tomb base is discovered, they would only sigh in vain, unable to do anything.

Recently, a Yuhua Gate has been added to the area to meet the needs of the Jing-Wu Road joint transportation. Therefore, the desolate atmosphere of the past has been embellished a lot. However, when we pass by there, the mysterious tomb of Lady Xi once again occupies our minds.

Japanese Correspondence

### Ambassador Xu's Return to China

— Liu Lang

On March 6th of last year, Ambassador Xu Jingren came eastward from Shanghai by boat. On March 6th of this year, Mr. Xu happened to be taking leave to return to China to report on his work. In this short year, this amiable and kind old man of Shuangxi (Mr. Xu's alias) has truly spread his beautiful feelings among Chinese and foreign people here.

I still remember when Mr. Xu arrived in the East last year, it was right after the February 26th Incident in Japan, when the atmosphere was gloomy, rain and snow were flying, and the weather was so cold that everyone felt shivering. But this year, cherry blossoms are budding, and the spring warms the three islands, as if symbolizing that Mr. Xu's years of hard work have led China's dormant diplomacy into another stage full of spring.

It is said that Mr. Xu's coming to the East was not his original wish, because he was deeply afraid that the barriers of language and writing would prevent him from exerting his skills to negotiate. In fact, the ambassadors of various countries stationed in Japan were also suffering from the same problem as Mr. Xu, and no one could directly engage in verbal battles with the "wooden-clog-wearing lads."

Mr. Xu always treats people with an open mind and a humble attitude, always acting as if he is inadequate. He can be said to be a person who has accumulated a lot of knowledge and has a long-term vision. He spares no effort in studying all issues related to Japan. All Japanese newspapers, magazines, and valuable writings are translated into Chinese by his assistants. Mr. Xu not only reads them once, but also adds detailed notes, leaving out not a single word, and does this every day, persisting for a long time. Therefore, Mr. Xu has only been in Japan for a year, but his knowledge of Japanese politics, economy, military affairs, national defense, and even customs and habits is thorough and subtle. Even Japanese experts who have lived in Japan for decades cannot compare to him.

There are no fewer than several thousand Chinese students studying in Japan who live in Tokyo. Hearing of Mr. Xu's amiability and kindness, they all think it is an honor to see him. Therefore, those seeking to see him come one after another every day, and Mr. Xu never refuses anyone, and encourages them with added effort. If someone has a special skill, he even humbly asks for advice. Therefore, young students, no matter whether their ideology is left or right, all unanimously love and respect him, and regard him as a "sage." For example, the student union, which was previously criticized as having a different background, had bare walls except for a few tables and chairs. There was no flag of the party or the country, nor a portrait of the Premier, but in the center of the wall was a large photograph of Mr. Xu, which is enough to show their respect for him.

After the news of Mr. Xu's return to China came out, various parties hosted farewell banquets for him, even as many as a dozen on the same day. Mr. Xu could not be in multiple places at the same time, so he often neglected one thing for another. It is said that a certain Japanese person specially arranged a grand banquet at a large restaurant, but fearing that Mr. Xu might not be able to attend, he drove a motorcycle to chase after Mr. Xu's car, going to various places. Finally, late at night, he kidnapped Mr. Xu, which can be said to be the most sincere friend among those who hosted banquets.

At 1:40 p.m. on the 6th, Mr. Xu departed from Tokyo Station. Tens of thousands of people came to see him off, and officials and carriages were like clouds. Representatives of Prime Minister Lin, Foreign Minister Sato, and Finance Minister Yuki, as well as former Foreign Ministers Yoshizawa Kenkichi and Arita Hachiro, former Ambassador to Germany Obata Kiichi, former Ambassador to China Ariyoshi Akira, Information Director Amau Eiji, and other famous people of the time, were too numerous to count. The enthusiasm of the situation was unprecedented. Among the assembly of talented people, there was a special guest who attracted the attention of the general public and must be recorded. The guest's face was haggard, his steps were unsteady, he wore a long robe, a mandarin jacket, flat-bottomed court shoes, and a melon-shaped hat, with a large red knot attached to the top of the hat. He frequently cupped his hands and greeted Mr. Xu. Those who did not know him would have thought that this man was a frustrated Chinese official who was searching for opportunities overseas. In fact, he was the "unadulterated Yamato race's" celebrity known as the "China expert" Goto Asataro.

As the scene of farewell at Tokyo Station came to an end, what followed was the grand occasion at the Yokohama port. Many Chinese residents and students in Tokyo rushed to Yokohama to see him off. After joining with the compatriots in Yokohama, the number of people increased and the momentum became stronger. The members of the Chinese Youth League of the Yokohama Chinese Chamber of Commerce were all dressed in uniforms, standing in line at the pier, paying tribute to Mr. Xu. After shouting "Long live" three times, they sang their party song, and everyone echoed it, resounding through the clouds. The most amusing thing was that some students from Guangdong province studying in Japan, distressed by the inability of the Cantonese language to fully express their feelings, raised their heads to the bow of the ship and shouted "Ma da i lai xie xi" (Please come again) non-stop. Mr. Xu also responded with "Domo arigato" (Thank you), which made the audience laugh. When the clock struck eight, the whistle sounded, and Mr. Xu set sail, breaking through the waves. Eight people accompanied Mr. Xu on his return, which was jokingly referred to as the "Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea."

### Reporter's Conversation

— (Lao Yan)

About My Wife's Illness

A few days ago, I wrote in this column about Shen Bao reporter Mr. Huang Jiping's story of his respected father's anemia being cured by taking "human blood." Mr. Huang continued to talk to me about something else, and now I will also record it below:

Mr. Huang said: Three years ago, my wife suddenly suffered from hemoptysis. After being treated by famous Chinese and Western doctors, the bleeding stopped, but she still had a lot of phlegm and cough, and her lung qi was insufficient! A Western doctor advised her to take more "milky white cod liver oil" to increase lung qi and help build strength. Of course, we listened to the doctor's advice. The "milky white cod liver oil" we bought was also produced by Wuzhou Pharmacy. At first, we felt a little uncomfortable taking it, but we got used to it after taking it for a long time. We took it without stopping every meal for two years, counting at least thirty bottles. Sure enough, her qi and blood became very sufficient, and her body was the same as before, and even much healthier. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . "

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Chapter Eleven (Sentimental Words Feel the Compassion of a Loving Wife, Confessing Filial Piety to Sacrifice Autumn Light, Dark Green Eyebrows Touch the Scene to Write About Feelings)

He and Guoqi are like-minded. Today, he is wearing a blue mirror-faced flannel jacket, and his hair is combed black and shiny. He is wearing a Tolique glasses on his nose, which is a handsome and elegant figure. Guoqi blushed and said, "Why did you come in without a word?" Xiaosong smiled and said, "These poems are very well written. I think they have substance and are definitely not just empty words." Guoqi smiled and said, "You're doing something wrong." Xiaosong said, "You don't have to ask me whether this is right or wrong. I want to ask you, are these poems written and ready to be published in your novel manuscript? Or are you just writing them and not publishing them?" Guoqi said, "Of course I want to publish them." Xiaosong didn't ask further, but picked up the poems on the table again and recited them aloud, nodding and smiling: "At that time, I saw Liu Shanshan, and it was difficult to say a word when the phoenix trees fell. This gentleman is too lacking in courage. How can he not be able to talk after seeing each other for so long? He still stands quietly every day when he is busy, secretly looking at the green ring low, which is quite interesting. Why doesn't he use the word 'steal' for 'look from afar'? Is he still looking at it in an aboveboard way? In the last poem, it says to sit opposite the autumn flowers and cut a cold, which is simply your own experience." Saying that, he pointed to the chrysanthemums in the bottle on the table and smiled at Guoqi. Guoqi snatched the poems back, immediately put them in the drawer, closed the drawer, and smiled, "There is no third person here. Who are we bragging to?" Xiaosong sat down in the chair, tilted his head slightly, and still pondered, smiling: "This must have substance. I'll write a few with you, okay?" Guoqi sat diagonally opposite him, raised his head and looked at the sky outside the window, also with a slight smile. Xiaosong gently clapped his hands and said, "In my opinion, it must be your poem of ability. You..." Guoqi smiled and cupped his hands at him, and pointed a few times at the room of Zhang Laotai on the other side of the wall. Xiaosong lowered his voice and said, "According to my guess, you must be feeling quite difficult in this situation. Why don't you tell me the real situation? I can also think of some ideas for you. At the very least, I must make it possible for the two of you to talk. I think this lady must also be a poet. Yellow flowers are inserted in the beard, and one person walks in the setting sun in the west wind. Not to mention the person himself, even I feel lost in the artistic conception after reading this poem. What's more, you said that the thin eyebrows are damaged and the painting is not strong, and you can't see the rouge but tears." Guoqi was somewhat overwhelmed by his teasing, but he sighed softly. This sigh gave Xiaosong a hint, telling him that his guess was correct. Xiaosong was a nosy teenager, how could he let it go without asking? This matter is bound to reveal some news. (146)

Talk

### Worker Falls into the River

— Shen Jiaqian

The English translation of "dockworker" is "coolie". Literally, the sound and meaning are the same, even more appropriate than translating "Humor" as "幽默 (you mo)." However, the original intention of Westerners calling them "coolies" is not only because they are workers who "suffer" from "labor," but also to despise these brothers who shout "Hang Yo Hang Yo" all day long as inferior.

Originally, "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others" is also a clear teaching in China. Since they have become "coolies," they are only afraid that there is no place to "suffer" their "strength." They have no time to consider whether they are "inferior" or "excellent."

However, there are also "excellent elements" among the "coolies." Yesterday, this newspaper reported: "A worker from Jiangbei named He Fengrui at the Jinliyuan Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession suddenly fought with foreman Yang over a trivial matter. As a result, He was knocked into the river by Yang. By the time his companions rushed to salvage him, He had already disappeared with the waves. Yang, knowing that he had caused a major disaster, fled in the midst of the commotion..."

There is a point of doubt here. A worker died, and it was investigated clearly that his name was "He Fengrui," which is different from the historical reports of dozens of "coolies so-and-so" being injured (or killed). On the other hand, the foreman who knocked him into the river is simply referred to as "Yang so-and-so." If it weren't for the reporter deliberately making things mysterious, "Foreman Yang so-and-so" would be different from the general "ordinary coolie."

It also said "fought over a trivial matter." The so-called "trivial matter" was probably a "disagreement." However, no one witnessed it at the scene, so it is impossible to judge right and wrong. Judging from "knocked into the river" and "fled in the midst of the commotion," those "companions who rushed to" also distinguished "He Fengrui" from "Yang so-and-so." Although afterwards, "it was reported to the police station for investigation." What they will do is a matter for later.

Not long ago, I read a "reportage" about a yarn factory, in which the person called "Nama Wen" also stood tall in front of ordinary spinning girls in the posture of an "excellent element." From this, we can infer that even if you are the most "inferior" worker, if you can become a "foreman," you can also show off the prestige of being "excellent" in front of your peers.

However, don't ignore the reason why the foreign masters and compradores give special power to the "foremen." Let's copy a passage from "the lesson of the movie": "But when the white hero explores Africa, there are often black loyal servants who open the way for him, serve him, fight to the death for him, and die for him, so that the master can safely return home."

Now, who is the "excellent element?" Even if you become a "foreman" or "Nama Wen," at best, you are just "putting on a brave face to look imposing."

### Kite

— Lu Ping

For a little thing, I was finally forced to run back to my hometown, so I saw kites again.

In my childhood, every spring, as long as it was close to the Qingming Festival, many children of similar ages would gather on the slopes of my hometown, carrying various kites and balls of thread to fly them here. Everyone competed enthusiastically, who's kite was beautiful, who's was big, who's was flying the highest. Competitiveness filled the little minds of every innocent child.

I remember that my competitiveness was much stronger in my childhood than it is now. If I was occasionally ridiculed by others, I would feel uncomfortable for several days, and even secretly hide in a place where no one was and cry bitterly. Therefore, my father often said to my mother:

"This child is too clever and too competitive, and can't bear any grievances..."

However, I myself am very clear about this temper. When people talk about me, I always like to hear a few words of praise. My father always bought me something better or more than what he bought for others. If other people's things were better or more than mine, I would think it was a great shame and humiliation. If I didn't stubbornly refuse it, I would be sullen for a long time without saying a word or smiling, until I forgot about it before I would return to normal.

Perhaps my heart is too narrow, but I am willing to be like this. Even now, I still have that stubborn and unique personality.

At that time, every year I would buy a few kites to fly. The eagle kites and butterfly kites that my father bought for me could not satisfy me. I always asked my mother to buy me a general kite to play with. However, when I found a kite larger than mine among my companions, I would feel that my own could not catch up with others. Therefore, I would pester my father or mother again, and often get a beating. But I was not discouraged, because my grandmother and my sister An were my best mediators.

Anjie was the most skilled at flying kites. She could fly a kite of any style and size into the sky, and fly it very high and steadily. When retrieving it, she was so quick and proper that broken lines or flying kites rarely happened. I myself could not fly kites. All the kites I bought were flown by a cousin and Anjie. However, when I saw my own kite flying in the sky and defeating my companions, I felt an unspeakable joy in my heart.

At one point, Anjie and I also thought about making our own kites. So we bought paper, cut bamboo strips, and made a paste. After a busy time, we finally made a butterfly kite that looked like nothing. But when we ran to the Fengshui mound with great enthusiasm to fly it, it always couldn't fly. It seemed as if a piece of iron was tied to the kite. It was thrown up and immediately fell down. This swept away all our joy. From then on, we also realized that our skills were not good.

When I was twelve years old, I was studying in a private school in Huzhou. One day, I suddenly heard a familiar sound in the sky. The sound was very loud, a bit like a pigeon bell. I looked up and saw a giant centipede wriggling in the sky. The graceful posture and neat fine feet made me see it very clearly. The clear sound was released by it. In the evening, the black shadow was lit with spots of light, vaguely floating in the sky, flickering and swaying, like the stars in the sky or the fishing lights on the sea.

Later, I learned that it was a centipede kite, the sound was the kite bell, and the light was the kite lamp. But when I asked my father to buy a similar centipede kite, he said it would cost dozens of dollars and refused to buy it. When I told my mother, she also said it was too expensive and therefore could not afford it.

Now my cousin and Anjie have passed away one after another, but I still haven't bought a centipede kite. Although my father is dead and my mother will no longer beat me, I myself feel that it is too expensive!

After several years of wandering and drifting in several places, the vicissitudes of life have eroded my childhood feelings. The competitiveness of the past has disappeared along with that precious youth on the journey of life. Although I always feel a little lost when I see kites floating in the sky every year, it is ultimately just a momentary thing.

### A True Picture of the "Special Zone"

— Jin Ge

You all probably know that ×× has a special business zone, right? Let me tell you: get off the tram at ×× Gate and turn a corner, and you're there. The first thing you see is "×× Gold Shop". Don't be fooled, it's not a jewelry store, nor is it an old-fashioned gold shop that deals with money drafts. This is a special shop in the special business zone that sells special things. Don't believe me? Okay, look! What is written on that red, rectangular piece of paper on the wall by the door? It says: "This shop buys '× ash' at high prices." Still don't believe me? Go in and try saying, "I want to send money home." Won't they just curse you out? But on the other hand, you can buy so-called "opium" here. There are many shops like this, some are "yarn shops," some are "towel shops." In short, don't be fooled into buying what their signs say they sell.

The streets here are almost always wet. The garbage left behind by the vegetable vendors from the morning market isn't cleaned up by the street sweepers until 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon. When it rains, you really suspect you are stepping in a vat of soy sauce! Once, I walked down that street and saw a dead body lying on the side of the road. In the evening, when I walked past again, the dead body was still lying there, only now covered with a tattered straw mat.

Walking past these patients, the pungent smell wafts straight into your nose. If you have time to peek inside, you'll see someone squatting in the courtyard, tending to the stove. On the stove is a large pot, filled with a dark, gooey substance that seems to flow but doesn't. He's holding a large palm-leaf fan, fanning it vigorously. The red firelight illuminates the people outside the door. And the fragrance becomes more and more intense.

Further in are many small hand-rolled cigarette factories. These factories are so simple, you can hardly believe it. They just have a factory site the size and height of a square stool. The workshop is here, and the storefront is here. The manager, who is also the worker, the boss, and the salesperson, sits on a low stool. He makes cigarettes while also handling sales and serving customers. Business is very good, and he treats everyone the same, young and old, male and female. Most of his customers are rickshaw pullers or other laborers, who buy two cigarettes for one copper coin, and the price never goes up. As for certain people, a nod for one cigarette, a wink for another, one in the left hand, one in the right hand... Those managers, who are also the workers, the bosses, and the salespersons, never say a word. They know this is "income tax".

There are many small restaurants in the area, catering to those "hidden gentlemen," knowing that after their black rice, they'll want a bowl of white rice or a midnight snack. Business is very prosperous, especially at night.

There are also many second-hand shops in the area. There are not many used goods for sale inside the shop, but in front of the shop there are many glass-covered trays filled with cigarette holders, opium lamps, opium pipes, and other things I don't recognize, but all used for smoking. Many people go in and out of the shops, and you can often hear the sound of footsteps on the stairs. The shop assistants sit idly, yawning, while a large man with a bamboo pole wanders around the entrance in a leisurely manner.

One night, I walked down that street. Maybe I was a little thinner, or maybe it was a little colder, and I had my head tucked into the collar of my coat, with a few evening newspapers under my left shoulder. In the eyes of those "greeters," I looked like an "old gun." An "old gun" coming to the "special zone" obviously wants to "smoke two pipes". Sure enough, the "greeter" grabbed my coat sleeve and said, "Sir, do you want to smoke? ××'s opium is the best, and it's close by."

I turned around and glared at him, forcefully pulled my arm away, and hurried away. I knew he was cursing me, probably calling me things like "rube" and "rip-off".

Escaping the "special zone," my heart couldn't help but calm down. I looked up and saw a string of people, old and young, male and female, looking like crabs, all with "faces marked by opium" and "skinny as firewood"... cliches like that. The policeman in the lead was carrying several opium trays, opium pipes, opium lamps, and other smoking paraphernalia.

Looking at the location, it was right on ×× Road, just one step outside the "special zone."

A woman of tender heart and heroic spirit. Followed her gray-haired father into the hidden court. Pitiable, she was like a catkin in the wind, adrift in the rivers and lakes. But she encountered Mr. Fan, who made a forget-year friendship pact with her father. The families met without hesitation. They talked and laughed with great interest. Xiugu had a heart of pure respect and love. Most unforgettable was her dream of the Red Chamber in the hospital, which secretly consumed her soul. Recalling that her father was poor and sick and without direction. Fortunately, Mr. Fan's friend showed deep friendship and righteousness. Laughable that Xiugu, at first sight of Miss Fengxi, was confused her feelings. Chanting sutras and worshiping Buddha, she knocked on the wooden fish. Her heart was in turmoil, difficult to resolve. Countless entanglements, nowhere to describe. See her, bravely throwing herself into the General's Mansion, a shocking courage that soared into the sky. Bloodstained sword. Braving the snow in the Western Mountains, she did not refuse the labor. At the crossroads, infinite words of sadness. Only left a strand of black hair as a self-mockery. From then on, the world became strangers. Knowing that there was no such blessing to eliminate in the book of fate. Surpassing the Thirteenth Sister of that day. Abandoning the affections of children at once. A divine dragon cannot be summoned back from the sea.

### Automobile Smooth Braking Technique

— Qi Ji

Smooth braking is easy to learn. The driver has only to imagine that he himself is part of the brake. No matter how ingenious the design of the brake may be. the ultimate result depends largely on how the driver uses the brake pedal. The procedure is to straighten the right leg and support the body on the back of the seat. Because this posture can produce a reaction force. Some people of ordinary strength can also use high-force pedals in an emergency. This is because the action of the leg is very similar to that of an elbow lever. We use some ordinary strength on the leg. which will turn into a large pressure on the brake pedal. If the driver's seat and the brake pedal are properly configured. any ordinary person can use a force of one hundred and fifty pounds by the above method. Whether this configuration is appropriate or not has the most important relationship in smooth management of the brake. Otherwise. if the pedal is too close or too far from the seat. it is difficult to coordinate the lever action of the leg. It is best that the leg is almost straight when the pedal is fully depressed.

After this important preliminary matter is done. the second step to be discussed is the method of using the pedal. Some people suddenly depress the pedal completely when something happens. This is a big mistake. Even in an emergency. this should not be done. Sudden braking. is to drag a wheel locked. and does not stop in the same way as gradual braking. At that time. the tire is slippery and does not rotate. and the sense of direction is lost. Even on a dry road. it is better to keep the car turning. If you lock the wheels on a slippery road. the result is always unthinkable. You must pay more attention on uneven roads. Because the wheels jump and lose adhesion. If the brake is properly installed. then a light touch on the pedal can push the brake shoes into contact with the rotating drum. Regarding this point. when anyone tries it according to the above method. they will feel the position where the shoes and the drum touch. The actions of moving the foot from the accelerator to the brake and then pushing the brake in depend on the situation at the time. and are not difficult. However. the driver must gradually apply force on the brake pedal. In other words. when pressing the shoes against the drum. force must be applied gradually. Do not immediately use full force to press the shoes down. Only after making this way of using the brake a habit. can unnecessary pressure be avoided in an emergency. And you can park safely on slippery roads. and avoid the danger of the wheels slipping without rotating.

Another important point is that the driver is familiar with the brake's responsiveness. On several properly configured brakes. doubling the pressure can produce double the deceleration. But some brake configurations are disproportionate. For example. an eighty-pound pressure on the pedal can produce a normal deceleration force. while a force of one hundred pounds can lock the rear wheels. The pressure on the pedal varies from car to car. so we must pay special attention when driving an unfamiliar car.

If there is excessive friction in the gears between the pedal and the brake shoes. the brake will be difficult to manage. Therefore. small parts such as the brake guide wheel pivot and the transverse shaft support should also be lubricated frequently. Sometimes. even though the driver is very careful. and gradually uses pedal pressure. the brake still suddenly clamps the wheels. The reason for this is that the drum is scratched. or the lining is damaged. or the screw on the axle is loose.

The left picture shows the array of new Packard cars sold to various circles in this port after the Maddie Motor Company's first exhibition of the 1937 Packard car last Saturday. According to reports, this is one of the largest deliveries of Packard cars since the Maddie Motor Company took over the management of Packard cars in 1924. The new car owners are said to be Mr. Jin of the China Merchants Bureau. Mr. Pan of Jardine Matheson. Mr. Rong of Shenxin Yarn Factory. Mr. Marius of the North China Daily News. Mr. Baling of Douglas Aircraft Company. Mr. Smith of Mei'an Company. etc.

### Safe Driving Teaching

— (Y)

Whether the driver's skills are excellent or not is most related to the safety of the car. The Lane Technical High School in Chicago, USA, uses parts of the driving equipment of a discarded car, including the seat, steering wheel, brake, clutch, and levers, as desks for students to learn to drive. Each control lever has a wire connected to a gauge board in the area where the instructor stands. When students see the traffic conditions projected on the screen and move the driving equipment. all the disposal situations can be displayed on the lights. and the teacher can correct them at any time. After this initial teaching. students go to a driving range worth 35,000 gold dollars to practice. There are various types of runways. slopes. and turning angles to facilitate students' practice.

### Overview of the Front End of the New Ford V8 Car

The majestic appearance of the front end of the 1937 Ford V8 car can be said to provide a completely new concept of streamlining among the economical and inexpensive car types. In addition to the new majestic appearance of the front end. there are also two important functional reforms. making it a further step in streamlining. The headlights. which were originally separated and attached to the car body. are now hidden in the mudguards. thus greatly improving the appearance of the front end of the car. The top of the hood is now a smooth-profiled top platform. hinged to the vent cap. and can be lifted from the front end. The two sides of the hood are also very easy to move if necessary.

The appearance of the front end of the Ford V8 is extremely majestic and pleasing to the eye. The front and rear bumpers both have practical protection. The backs of the mudguards are all raised. and in practice. they fully apply the "teardrop" shape. The front mudguards are next to the hood. and are flush with the high heat dissipation grille. which further enhances the majesty and power of the front end of the car. The heat dissipation grille. decorated with the V8 logo. is made of stacked metal bars. and has thicker central and vertical inlays on both sides to form its outline. The heat dissipation grille is shaped like an "A". and its end bends backwards and is deeply embedded under the hood top platform. The front side is obliquely inclined and straight down. The side windows of the hood are horizontal and have chrome metal edges.

The screens that can be opened on the proud car body are inclined and divided in the middle to form a "V" shape. which adds a lot of color to the streamlined appearance.

### 1937 Lannuo New Cars Sell Well

Since the 1937 Lannuo new cars were changed to be managed by Fada Motor Company on Xiafei Road. sales have suddenly increased. The products of this factory are excellent this year. and the price is low. which is quite popular with car lovers. Therefore. after the first and second batches of new cars arrived in Shanghai. they were soon sold out. and those who came to buy them later were disappointed. Recently. there have been daily inquiries from those who want to order from the company. According to a spokesperson for the company. the third batch of new cars will arrive in Shanghai in early April.

### 1936 Annual Production and Sales Statistics of American Car Factories

— Ying Dai

—Total Sales of 4.6 Million Vehicles—

The United States is a leader in the automobile industry. Therefore. not only is the number of cars in the country greater than in any other country in the world. but also in the international market. American cars are also unparalleled. Due to the large sales volume. the state of the American automobile industry can also represent the state of the world automobile industry. Then. how many cars were produced by American car factories in the past year. 1936? This is certainly a question worth reporting. Here. let's record the total number of cars produced and sold by American factories in the past year.

According to recent statistics from the United States. based on the distribution of year-end dividends and the granting of bonuses. the total number of cars manufactured and even sold by various car factories in 1936 was 4,600,000 vehicles. This number can certainly represent the considerable development of the American automobile industry in 1936. In the eyes of car factories and car dealers. the fact that the production and sales of cars have returned to normal can prove that the results of the American national revival industry movement have been good.

When we look back. at the end of the previous year. when the new 1936 cars were launched. American car factories seemed to be stimulated by an accident. and the output immediately increased. As a result. in one year. the number of vehicles assembled and sold in the market was as high as 4,620,000. This number is indeed the highest record since the passing of the golden age of 1929 and the beginning of the recession. The total number of cars and trucks produced in 1929 was 5,600,000. making the American automobile industry in 1936 re-enter the bright path. In addition to the situation mentioned above. there are other factors. especially after the launch of the new 1937 cars. there were immediately surprising sales figures. Because the new cars were publicly exhibited in New York. people saw that there were several advantages that the new 1936 cars lacked. Therefore. all the car dealers at the end of the year. as soon as the new cars arrived. they could immediately sell them. The showrooms were often empty. without a display of new cars. That is to say. the difference between production and sales was also very small. very average. This situation can also make us think of the state of affairs in 1929. because by the end of the year. the number of unsold vehicles was not much.

In addition to dividends and bonuses. according to general estimates. the development of business in American car factories in the past year. such as buildings. the addition of machines. and extra payments to workers or shareholders. often totaled more than 200,000,000 yuan. The total value of the cars sold by all the car factories in 1936. together with the tires. was 3,000,000,000 yuan. It was only because of the shutdown of the Heipomo Beier factory and the reorganization was not yet completed that the car production was slightly affected. Otherwise. it would definitely be more than this number. In short. in any case. the American automobile industry in 1936 has entered the path of recovery. which no one will deny.
