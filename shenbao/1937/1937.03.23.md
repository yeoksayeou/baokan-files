Even after Hanyang fell and Li Yuanhong fled to Hongshan, I did not leave. Today's new provincial party headquarters is the former military government. Revisiting this old place fills me with joy.

### Japan Does Not Forget Its Acquired Interests in North China

Kita Advises Against Hasty Action; Start with Economic Cooperation

[Tianjin] Yin Ni, along with Sun Rongbin, the puppet secretary director, and Zhang Jun, the puppet intelligence section chief, arrived in Tianjin from Tongzhou by car at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 22nd, and immediately went to the Hibiscus Villa to meet Kita. At 10:00 AM, they accompanied Kita to the Zhangyuan residence to meet Tadashi Hashimoto and held secret talks for two and a half hours before dispersing at noon. Tadashi hosted a banquet at his official residence for those who participated in the talks. Yin will stay in Tianjin for two days before returning to Tongzhou. Those familiar with the Japanese situation observe that Japan's policy towards North China is still to carve it out of the scope of Sino-Japanese diplomacy and handle it as a special region. However, in order to ease the emotions of the Chinese people, it is changing political issues into economic issues, but it is determined not to give up its acquired interests in North China. Kita's visit advocates temporarily trying to adjust national relations, economic cooperation, and diplomacy for four months. If profits can be found, even sacrificing the two puppet organizations in eastern Hebei and northern Chahar is not hesitated. If this path is not viable, then economic issues will be abandoned and the focus will be on promoting military diplomacy. Kita also firmly urged the military in this area to abide by this principle and wait quietly for the promotion of the aforementioned strategies. Before leaving China, he rushed back to Shanghai and reported to Kawagoe on the opinions he had gathered from various parties in North China for his reference upon returning to Japan.

### Central Authority's Two Memorial Weeks

[Nanjing] The Central Authority held its 68th Memorial Week at 9:00 AM on the 22nd. Attendees included Central Committee members Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chujian, Ju Zheng, He Yingqin, Ma Chaojun, Wang Chonghui, Jiang Zuobin, Wang Boqun, Wang Yongbin, Liu Jiwen, Chen Bijun, Hong Lanyou, Zhou Qigang, Wang Maogong, Chen Shaokuan, Li Zonghuang, Wu Zhongxin, Li Jingzhai, Hong Ludong, Shao Hua, Di Ying, Wang Zizhuang, Gu Zhengding, Xu Enzeng, and all staff members, totaling approximately 700 people. Chairman Wang Zhaoming presided and, after performing the rituals, delivered a report, the original text of which is as follows:

▲Impressions of Suiyuan: Comrades, Brothers, I was assigned by the Central Authority to go to Suiyuan to pay tribute to the fallen soldiers. On the afternoon of the 13th, I flew to Taiyuan. On the morning of the 15th, I flew with Comrade Yan Baichuan to Guisui to attend the memorial service. On the 16th, I attended the military parade. On the 17th, I attended the completion of the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Affairs Committee and flew back to Taiyuan. On the 18th, I flew back to the capital. In this short period, I gained many impressions, but today I can only share some of them. First, the Shanxi and Suiyuan military and political authorities deeply understand the Central Authority's policy of national salvation and survival, and wholeheartedly and practically implement it. Second, people from all walks of life in Shanxi and Suiyuan understand the meaning of sincere unity to overcome national difficulties, support the Central Authority, and enthusiastically assist local authorities in their work, especially in mass training, which is taken very seriously. The military parade showed a tendency of unity, and ordinary people are also very enthusiastic about military training. Some have only been trained for a month or so, but they have already achieved excellent results in the march-past. Third, all military and political circles hold a firm and unwavering determination to defend the territory and resist aggression, but they are not complacent, without any pride or negligence. They usually deeply understand the meaning of national unity and shared weal and woe, and engage in preparations with a spirit of patience. Once something happens, they will stand at the forefront of national defense and never retreat a single step. Fourth, the princes and Mongolian compatriots in the Suiyuan-Mongolian border also deeply understand the righteousness, unite as one, and strive to resist foreign insults. There is no distinction between Han and Mongol, and there has been significant progress in political affairs and education. All of the above are extremely gratifying. However, Suiyuan Province is sparsely populated, and the local finances, social economy, and people's lives are all feeling hardship, which is extremely worrying. I hope everyone will always think of our compatriots standing at the forefront of national defense and work harder on economic development to improve the people's strength, which will also increase the strength of national defense. Speaking of which, Brother wants to describe the general opinions exchanged with comrades in Shanxi and Suiyuan.

▲Catching Up: If China wants to achieve national salvation and survival today, it must work hard to increase the strength of the people to increase the strength of the country. This is beyond doubt. Of course, when we are accumulating, we have not forgotten sacrifice. When sacrifice is needed, we will inevitably use all the accumulation for sacrifice to expand the impact of sacrifice. However, during the accumulation time, we can only do our best to increase the accumulation. Some people say that accumulation is too late today because our industries and economy are all lagging behind. Even if we accumulate, we cannot compete with advanced countries, so even accumulation will not help to avert the crisis. We really cannot say that these words are unreasonable, but this pessimism is futile. If we want to achieve national salvation and survival, we must abandon the idea of "it's too late" and, based on the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen of "catching up," engage vigorously. The meaning of "catching up" is profound, and Brother cannot speculate on it arbitrarily, but thinking from the obvious and shallow, if we follow the path that others have taken, then naturally we will never catch up. For example, if economic construction follows the path of capitalism, or the path of communism, or the path of fascism, then no matter what, we will always fall behind. On the contrary, now the world, no matter what kind of doctrine, after some experimentation, has found shortcomings and made revisions. If Soviet Russia did not have the New Economic Policy and the two Five-Year Plans, it would never have the success of today's economic construction. Therefore, some people say that the current situation in the Soviet Union is that communism has failed, but economic construction has succeeded. For example, capitalist countries are also working hard to correct shortcomings. No matter what kind of economic system, they are all striving to make it rational and socialized. This can be seen anytime and anywhere in the economic construction of Britain and the United States. Dr. Sun Yat-Sen saw through this trend decades ago. The Three Principles of the People have pointed out a broad road for China's economic construction. This road is the common trend of countries around the world today. The meaning of "catching up" may lie in this. In other words, if China's economic construction today follows the path that others have already taken, then it is too late. If we synthesize various theories and the practical experience of various countries, discard the shortcomings and take the advantages, determine the direction, and move forward, then it is "catching up." However, we must pay attention. If we want to achieve "catching up," economic construction must not be piecemeal, but must have a whole plan. It must not be trivial, but must think from the big picture. Only in this way can we achieve "catching up." Otherwise, we only care about "catching up," but we cannot "catch up." Even if the country is idle, it is a waste of time, not to mention that the country is now in such a crisis of survival, time is really not waiting for us.

▲Eradicating the Red Disaster: There are a few more words. When Brother was in Shanxi and Suiyuan, comrades paid great attention to China's policy of eradicating the Red Disaster and asked many questions. The words that Brother replied have been published in the newspaper. If the communists do not accept the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, then they can only tend to extinction. If they accept, then the road to self-salvation is not cut off. However, the so-called acceptance must be sincere. For example, the theory of class struggle is enough to dismantle the unity of the entire nation and is absolutely intolerable. However, if they superficially abandon the propaganda of class struggle, but actually mix into the masses to carry out their divisive role and promote the collapse of the unity of the entire nation, that is not sincerely accepting the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, but changing strategies to take advantage of the situation. Its viciousness is even more hateful than the clear propaganda of class struggle. In view of the various painful experiences in the past, we cannot but arouse the attention of the masses and monitor them with a very serious attitude in order to prevent them. The fundamental and positive prevention method is still the progress of economic construction. Because if economic construction progresses, the people's suffering can be relieved, production can be increased, distribution can be rationalized, and consumption power can be strengthened. The people have a way to survive in front of them, and they can walk away freely. Naturally, there is no danger of taking risks, and even if ambitious people want to advocate chaos, they will suffer from having nothing to rely on. What has been said above can prove that internal security and resistance to foreign aggression are one thing, not two things. Even if we only talk about resistance to foreign aggression, peacetime accumulation and final sacrifice are also one thing, not two things. When our comrades are in this time of national survival crisis, we can only recognize this direction and do our best to move forward, followed by death, and there is nothing else to say. This is the general opinion exchanged with comrades in Shanxi and Suiyuan this time. Finished. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

Current Commentary

### Philippine Request for Early Independence

— Fu

Philippine Republic President Quezon has gone to the United States this time. In addition to discussing business issues with the Washington authorities, he has also raised the issue of the early independence of the Philippine Islands. Originally, according to the provisions of the Tydings-McDuffie Act, the Philippine Republic would not be fully independent until after 1945. Before 1945, although the Philippine Islands were ostensibly separated from the rule of the United States and became a republic, in reality, except for some unimportant internal affairs, the remaining powers such as national debt, currency system, diplomatic relations, immigration issues, constitutional amendments, and national defense were still exercised by the United States. This kind of formal independence is of course unacceptable to the freedom-loving people of the Philippines. Therefore, one year after the implementation of the Independence Act, President Quezon raised the issue of advancing the independence period in this conversation, changing it from 1945 to 1938 and 1939. According to foreign news reports, the U.S. government has agreed to consider it and plans to organize a committee of experts to study and amend the Philippine Independence Act. However, formal action will have to wait until the committee of experts submits a report to Congress. Therefore, in the near future, there will be no decision on the issue of advancing independence.

How the United States will decide on this issue in the future will of course depend on the results of the expert committee's research and the attitude of Congress. We cannot make any definitive predictions now. However, the general public opinion in the United States can be used as a reference for us to examine this issue. Americans have always been divided into two factions regarding the Philippine independence issue. One faction advocates not letting go, and the other faction supports independence. The divergence of opinions between these two factions can also reflect the turbulent situation of the United States' Far East policy. Most of those who advocate independence are people who support the United States' withdrawal from the Far Eastern stage. They believe that the economic interests of the United States in the Far East are not significant (especially referring to China), so why waste such huge expenses to maintain the strength of the navy and army? They also believe that if a war breaks out, the Philippines will be easily occupied by Japan. Therefore, they advocate withdrawing from China and abandoning the Philippine Islands, and using Hawaii as the first line of national defense. However, the other faction opposes the United States' withdrawal from China and abandonment of the Philippines from economic, political, and military perspectives. They even believe that political and military interests outweigh all economic interests, because under the advantage of politics, the economic forces can have the possibility of smooth development. The strength of this faction is of course greater than the former faction. For example, recently, Secretary of State Hull expressed the close attention of the United States to the Far Eastern issue. Hull said, "Throughout the year, the situation in the Far East has not been stable. The issue of protecting American citizens in China has always been of close concern to the State Department, and sometimes it has caused serious worries. The lives and property of American citizens and the peace and welfare of the Far Eastern countries are all of concern to the United States, which makes us pay close attention to any development in that area." (See the National News Agency telegram on the 19th).

According to the above, since the power of the faction that opposes the United States' withdrawal from the Far Eastern stage is very large, then the United States should not allow the Philippines to establish a republic and be fully independent in ten years. But in fact, why did the Washington authorities implement the Independence Act long ago and now allow the organization of an expert committee to consider the issue of advancing independence? In fact, there is another reason for this. Because in future international relations, the integration of national sentiments is very important. If the United States firmly opposes the independence of the Philippines, it will inevitably cause great resentment among the Filipinos. Therefore, in future wars, the people of the Philippine Islands will not only not help the United States in combat, but may instead throw themselves into the arms of the enemies of the United States. Conversely, if the United States allows the Philippines a certain degree of independence, then it can win the favor of the people of the Philippine Islands and make great efforts for the United States in future wars. Looking at the fact that after the implementation of the Philippine Independence Act, the United States sent General MacArthur to organize the Philippine Defense Force, these newly trained national defense forces will become powerful soldiers on the front lines of the United States in the Far East in a few years. This method of retreating to advance is the most ingenious method for modern imperialists to rule colonial peoples. Therefore, although the power of the faction that opposes the withdrawal from the Far Eastern stage within the United States is very large, it can still allow the Philippines a limited degree of independence. Last year, Britain's allowing Egypt to be independent was also an application of this principle. As for whether President Quezon's proposed request for early independence can be satisfactorily resolved, it also depends on whether the United States makes good use of this strategy of retreating to advance.

### Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations Difficult to Adjust Under the Current Situation

The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun Believes That Kodama and Others' Trip Yielded No Results; Japan Plans to Promote Cultural Activities with China

[Nanjing] The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun published an editorial on the 22nd entitled "Adjusting Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations," which stated that the results of the Japanese delegation's week-long visit to China can be summarized by the words of Mr. Miyazaki, President of Nisshin Spinning, who said, "Both China and Japan are voicing grievances, and there is no opportunity to negotiate economic cooperation." Furthermore, summarizing reports from various sources, the following three conclusions have been reached: ㊀ It is extremely difficult to adjust diplomatic relations in the short term, and there is no other way but to maintain the status quo; ㊁ Japan should always assist China in completing a modern nation; ㊂ Under the current situation of Sino-Japanese confrontation, economic cooperation is absolutely impossible, and Japan has no room for economic advancement other than North China. The reason for this is that when the delegation was in China, Chinese officials and civilians unanimously advocated the necessity of first resolving political issues, which led to the loss of the best opportunity. As a result, the atmosphere between China and Japan was unnecessarily suppressed, causing the Japanese side to lose hope of adjusting diplomatic relations and advocate maintaining the status quo. At the same time, Japan's concern for North China suddenly increased, leading to its view that "there is no economic advancement other than North China," and it considers maintaining the status quo as Japan's maximum concession. Concessions beyond this limit would only make the situation more complicated. As for the Ji-Dong issue, if it is cancelled, the Chinese people will inevitably take the opportunity to challenge Japanese interests, just as the Zhang Xueliang regime used the poisonous plan of overthrowing the South Manchuria Railway in the three northeastern provinces in the past. Japan is very afraid of the recurrence of such incidents. Furthermore, special trade in Ji-Dong should be negotiated separately from the regime issue. Japan has now recognized the necessity of political adjustment in North China, so China should approach Japan with greater enthusiasm and dispel its anxieties. It is a pity that China failed to take advantage of this opportunity this time, etc. (Kyodo News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

[Nanjing] The Japanese House of Peers held a meeting today, and Sadajo Eguchi requested that in addition to the Boxer Indemnity used for repayment, the government should also use special funds from the national treasury to enable Japan's cultural undertakings in China to expand from purely specialized academic research to the study of the actual situation in China, and improve facilities to absorb Chinese students studying in Japan. Eguchi also requested the organization of a special committee directly under the government to promote cultural activities with China. Okada, the director of the Cultural Affairs Department for China of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, replied that Mr. Eguchi's opinions would be regarded as beneficial references and hoped that they would be implemented in the future with the power of new laws. The majority of the Japanese cultural undertaking fund for China comes from the Boxer Indemnity used for repayment. The total amount of its principal and interest was about 70 million yuan in the past, and 43 million yuan has now been paid. According to the restrictions of Japanese law, this fund is only stored by the Ministry of Finance in the form of domestic public bonds and deposits, and only its interest is used for cultural activities with China. Recently, the parliament passed an amendment to the law, stipulating that the fund will be used from April 1st to purchase Chinese national public bonds, invest in railways and mining, and other undertakings in North China. Therefore, the so-called cultural fund has been diverted to other purposes, and its goal has exceeded the scope of culture. It is extremely important to view this amendment in conjunction with the recent talks on concentrating Japanese economic activities in North China and the reluctance of Japanese financial groups to invest in North China.

### Japanese House of Representatives Discusses Japanese-Russian Pending Issues

Foreign Minister Answers Questions from Assembly Members

[Nanjing] The House of Representatives held a general budget meeting on the morning of the 22nd, and Tomobu of the Seiyukai Party asked,

Is the fishing right of Japan when the Soviet Union refused to sign a new fisheries treaty, indeed a vested interest that can be resolutely asserted?

Foreign Minister Sato replied,

The rights maintained since the Portsmouth Agreement will never be diminished.

Tomobu asked,

Does the so-called free fishing have the meaning of using force? In the event of an emergency, does the Foreign Minister have the determination?

Foreign Minister Sato replied,

Even if the negotiations fail, efforts must be made to avoid the occurrence of major problems in diplomatic relations.

Tomobu asked,

The recent two fishing zone auctions have been very unfavorable to Japan. The Soviet Union's five-year plan is now proceeding in the direction of recovering Japanese rights. Therefore, I cannot believe that the fisheries treaty will proceed easily. In my opinion, this is the crisis that Prime Minister Hayashi referred to as being on the verge of eruption. Does the Foreign Minister have awareness of this?

Foreign Minister Sato replied,

I have also not considered that the fisheries treaty will proceed smoothly. Therefore, I cannot but be aware that many difficulties will be encountered in the future, and I will deal with them with the best efforts at that time.

Tomobu asked,

Did former Foreign Minister Arita ever negotiate with the Soviet Union on the withdrawal of Soviet troops?

Vice-Minister Horiuchi replied,

During the Hirota Foreign Minister era, there were repeated requests for the Soviet Union to reflect on the phenomenon of border defense, and it was intended to practically stipulate this issue through a bilateral agreement. The Russian side should first express its sincerity, and then it would be possible.

Tomobu further questioned the issue of oil resources in North Sakhalin, and the Foreign Minister made a response to this.

Saburo Yatsukado (Seiyukai) raised a question regarding the entry of Japanese warships into the Soviet port (Pidro Vinroski).

Foreign Minister Sato replied,

Various problems are confused, so although full efforts must be made on the Soviet Union issue in the future, it cannot be stated that the relationship can be quickly improved.

Mr. Yatsukado continued to ask,

Can a treaty that has been rejected be reconstructed from a new starting point?

Vice-Minister Horiuchi replied,

Even if the content is the same in the future, it should become a newly established provision.

Mr. Yatsukado also inquired about the progress of the Soviet-Manchukuo border demarcation committee and requested an explanation. Vice-Minister Horiuchi replied,

Committees are established separately for handling border disputes and preventing the occurrence of border disputes. For the former, the Soviet side advocated establishing a committee to handle all border disputes, while the Japanese side advocated limiting it to the eastern border. The Soviet Union also agreed to this. For the latter, although the Soviet Union has agreed, there are still some unresolved cases to date, so it is hoped that the Soviet Union will adopt a sincere attitude.

Mr. Yatsukado also asked,

What places remain?

Vice-Minister Horiuchi replied,

One is regarding the composition of the committee. The Soviet Union wants to treat Japan and "Manchukuo" as one, while the Japanese side advocates that Japan, "Manchukuo," and the Soviet Union jointly organize it. The other is regarding the border line.

Next, Committee Chairman Oyama asked,

With the session approaching and the bills piling up, does the government intend to seek any methods? Prime Minister Hayashi replied,

I feel there is a need to find a way.

### Soviet Anti-Japanese Actions

Japanese Consul-General Stationed in Vladivostok Summoned Back to Discuss Countermeasures

[Nanjing] According to an official report received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 21st, Kozlovsky, the Minister of the Far East of the Soviet Union, notified the Japanese diplomatic missions in Russia that the Soviet government will not allow the Japanese merchant ship association in Vladivostok to conduct business this year. All matters concerning Japanese ships arriving at the port of Vladivostok will be handled by the Soviet Maritime General Agency.

As a result, the business operations of the Japanese merchant ship association have been virtually suspended, and the affairs of Japanese ships cannot be fully implemented. The authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, due to the increasingly intense oppression of Japanese residents by the Soviet Union, decided to order Consul-General Sugishita stationed in Vladivostok to urgently return to the country to discuss follow-up measures.

In addition, he will do his best to protect Japanese residents and plans to clear away the dark clouds between Japan and the Soviet Union in the past and assist our side. Therefore, Vladivostok in the future should become brighter. As for the inspection of Japanese ships entering the port, it has also been very peaceful recently, etc. (Kyodo News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

### Britain and France Agree to Restore Belgian Neutral Status

Support Belgium's Removal of Guarantor Obligations; The Issue is Complex and Not Easily Resolved Quickly

[Paris] According to informed sources, the British and French governments have agreed to issue a declaration in the near future to release Belgium from the guarantor obligations stipulated in the Locarno Treaty and support Belgium's release from the obligations stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant (which refers to Article 16 of the Covenant, which stipulates that when the League of Nations implements military sanctions, member states have the obligation to assist with military force and allow the troops of other member states to pass through). According to reports, the British government sent a document to France some time ago, explaining Britain's views. The French government sent a document to the British government yesterday, stating France's views. It is heard that the attitudes of Britain and France are completely integrated and seamless. Both sides advocate that the issue of Belgian neutrality should be resolved quickly through diplomatic channels before negotiations on the new Locarno Treaty are held, and especially as soon as possible before the by-election of members of the House of Representatives in the Belgian capital. There are now only some difficulties in the details, which will be resolved during the visit of King Leopold III of Belgium. It is generally believed that Britain advocates that the League of Nations adopt a resolution to release Belgium from the obligation of military sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, but the obligation of economic sanctions should still be fulfilled. In this regard, Belgium is willing to provide a promise that if foreign troops act in accordance with Article 16 of the Covenant to implement sanctions, Belgium should allow them to pass through Belgian territory, but Belgium's promise is subject to a condition, that is, the foreign troops passing through can only travel from one border of Belgium to another border, and cannot occupy Belgian territory or establish bases in Belgian territory. It is heard that Britain and France are still prepared to satisfy Belgium's claim, but one thing that is most difficult is that after German troops were stationed in the Rhineland region last March, Britain, France, and Belgium established a staff agreement stipulating that the three countries should cooperate militarily with each other. Now Belgium is unwilling to maintain this agreement, which is quite difficult for Britain and France to deal with. It is generally believed that the staff agreement between Britain, France, and Belgium will be declared invalid, and King Leopold III of Belgium will provide an informal guarantee, expressing Belgium's decision to continue to cooperate with Britain and France. Responsible parties expect that after King Leopold comes here for negotiations, an informal agreement can be established with the British government first, and after France participates, it will become a formal agreement. At the same time, Britain and France may first issue a public declaration to release Belgium from the obligations of the guarantor state and only be the guaranteed state. As for other issues, they will be thoroughly discussed later. The declaration will likely state that the new system regarding Belgian neutrality can be stated in the new Locarno Treaty in the future, because its intention is to prevent the negotiations of the new Locarno Treaty from being interrupted as a result, and to prevent this move from causing international tensions. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 21st)

[Paris] It is rumored that Belgium intends to request Britain and France to lift the military mutual assistance constraints of neutral countries in the Locarno Treaty. It was learned from here today that the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs is preparing to protest to Belgium. (National News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

### Belgian King Arrives in England

⊙Dover, England　King Leopold III of Belgium, who had just left the port of Ostend in his country at 11 a.m., arrived in England by boat and arrived here at 2:10 p.m. He immediately changed to a train to London, which is expected to arrive at 4 p.m. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)

[Paris] King Leopold III of Belgium is scheduled to go to London this day to conduct talks with the British authorities on the issue of Belgian neutrality. The newspapers here have commented on the King of Belgium's visit. "Le Petit Journal" stated, "The King of Belgium will not make any demands that would hinder the hope of establishing a future Western European Convention, because the country has always supported the principle of collective security, which is no different from Britain and France, and without the help of Britain and France, Belgium would have no collective security to speak of." The Figaro newspaper published a dispatch from a London correspondent stating, "Although the issue of Belgian neutrality is extremely complicated and not easily resolved quickly, the declaration of recognition of Belgian neutrality by Britain and France may be issued on Thursday of this week."

### British-Italian Negotiations

Secretly Conducted in Rome

### Policy Change in Austria, Anti-German Sentiment Intensifies

Safeguarding National Independence, Leaning Towards Cooperation with Hungary and Czechoslovakia

⊙ Graz, Austria - Today, it was learned that authorities here searched the National Socialist Party's offices late last week, detaining thirty members. This action further confirms the strong anti-German sentiment in Austria. (National Telegram, 22nd)

[London] Regarding Austria's attitude towards Germany, the Vienna correspondent of the Morning Post recently stated that after the Austrian government dismissed the pro-German cabinet member, the Minister of Public Security, Stummer, yesterday, it would treat members of the National Socialist Party severely. "Austria was previously lukewarm to the Danube River region cooperation plan, but in recent months, Prime Minister Schuschnigg has realized that there is currently no real possibility of restoring the Habsburg dynasty. If the country wants to guarantee its independence, it must obtain new allies. Therefore, it is generally believed that the country is preparing to cooperate with Czechoslovakia and Hungary. In the past, Czechoslovakia and Hungary were ruled by Turkey and the Habsburg dynasty, and they struggled for centuries to break free from their shackles. Now, they are unwilling to be subjected to Germany's control again," he said. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 22nd)

### Italian Navy Manoeuvres off the Coast of Libya

Italian Prime Minister Leaves North Africa and Returns Home

⊙ Tripoli Port - Special dispatch from our correspondent: When Italian Prime Minister Mussolini came here a few days ago to preside over the opening ceremony of the coastal highway, most of the warships also gathered in this port. According to the scheduled plan, the First Fleet will conduct exercises along the coast of Libya, and the Third Fleet will conduct exercises between Syracuse and Augusta in Sicily, southern Italy. Because Mussolini decided to return to his country quickly, he sent many warships to station in the port of Syracuse when the Prime Minister crossed the sea, and the ships docked in the port of Tripoli suddenly attacked the Tyrrhenian coast of southeastern Italy. This exercise is personally commanded by Vice Admiral Cagni, Chief of the Naval Staff. In addition to the participation of the First and Second Fleets, the submarine fleet and the air force also joined. The First Fleet includes seven 10,000-ton cruisers, the Second Fleet includes six 10,000-ton cruisers, four destroyers, and many submarines. Regarding this exercise, naval staff officers recently told our correspondent that this action has no aggressive nature. The selection of the exercise location is based on two reasons: ㊀ The transportation line between mainland Italy and East African territories is vital to Italy's survival. ㊁ The coast of Sicily in southern Italy is the most vulnerable point in Italy's national defense. In addition, Italy also wants to build fortifications on the Italian island of Pantelleria in the Mediterranean (a key point from the western Mediterranean to the east), because setting up defenses on the island is very appropriate, he said. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 22nd)

[Rome] Mussolini did not wait for the Italian navy to complete its exercises in the Libyan sea, but suddenly took the cruiser "Pola" from Tripoli port last night and returned to his country quickly. It is estimated that he will land at Gaeta port in southern Italy today, and then take a car to Rome. It is rumored that the Prime Minister's move was due to the developments in the European situation in the past few days. Officials here have denied this. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 22nd)

[Paris] Regarding Mussolini's sudden return from North Africa, the Paris Noon Daily recently commented that the main reason for Mussolini's hasty return was the result of the evolution of the Austrian political situation, and the axis formed by Italy and Germany had encountered a crisis. "This axis was based on the current relationship between Germany and Austria, that is, based on Austria's obedience. However, the development of the Austrian political situation shows that the country has a tendency to rebel and does not want to rely on Italy and Germany to maintain its security," he said. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 22nd)

[London] The Daily Telegraph recently published a message from its Rome correspondent, claiming that according to what was known in Rome last night, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is now planning to return to his country early without waiting for the country's navy to complete its exercises in the North African Libyan sea, so as to discuss the situation of the Spanish war with domestic army leaders. The Labor Party's newspaper, the Daily Herald, also stated that "The Italian Prime Minister's early return is nominally due to the strong winds and dust in Libya, which made it inconvenient to inspect, but in fact, the situation of the Spanish war must be related to the Italian Prime Minister's decision." (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 22nd)

### German Government Violates the Concordat

Papal Encyclical Severely Condemns

[Berlin] Catholic churches here today recited a papal encyclical from Rome, stating that the National Socialist government has violated the previously established concordat and encouraged anti-Christian movements. After reciting the encyclical, Bishop Bresing announced the current tense situation and ordered the congregation to prepare for open national disputes. The papal encyclical accused the National Socialist government of misusing the concordat, evading the terms of the concordat, damaging the content of the concordat, and publicly violating the treaty. It also stated that the Pope will continue to deal with the exploitation of guaranteed rights with open or covert forces, and that the elevation of racial and national ideas above worldly values to the status of idols is a blasphemous act. It also condemned the inappropriateness of closing church schools, the lack of freedom of religious science, and the implied anti-Christian meaning of other courses. The Pope also stated that his only wish is that a true peace can be established between politics and religion. Finally, he said that if peace does not come, the Church will rise up and resist in the name of God to protect its rights, because God's arm has not been shortened even in this world. According to the Church's observations, the German government may revoke the previously signed concordat with the Pope in the future. (Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 21st)

### German Government Issues Response

[Berlin] After the Catholic churches here read the papal encyclical from Rome yesterday, accusing the National Socialist Party of violating the concordat and encouraging anti-Christian movements, the German government immediately responded. The People's Observer, authorized by the authorities, published an editorial today, saying that although the concordat was originally intended to be a permanent solution when it was established, it is naturally invalid if it endangers the existence of the country. Since the establishment of this concordat, I don't know how many millions of German Catholics have served the country without any conditions, but there are many senior and junior clergy who have never done this. They believe that their duty is to disrupt domestic peace, oppose the country and the National Socialist Party, and harm the country at home and abroad, he said.

### Rebel Army Severely Defeated on the Guadalajara Front

Two Divisions of Italian Soldiers Collapse, Morale in the Capital Greatly Stabilized

⊙ Madrid - General Miaja, the supreme commander of the government army in central Spain, issued an article today congratulating his troops on their victory in Brihuega. The article stated that the battle rendered two powerful divisions of Italian soldiers crippled. It also said, "Our army is now advancing on the road to victory. However, the brave and fearless spirit of the soldiers is not enough. It must be accompanied by discipline before victory can be guaranteed." General Miaja also claimed that this victory has greatly stabilized the morale in the capital. Because the capital is in a dangerous situation due to the public enemy, political differences have been reduced compared to before, and food distribution has also improved. At the same time, according to the government army, the government army continued to advance and captured several villages, several highlands, and a large number of war supplies. When inspecting the corpses on the battlefield, a major from the Italian Army Staff was found. (Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 22nd)

⊙ Madrid - The Defense Committee issued a communiqué in the evening, stating that on the Guadalajara front in northeastern Spain, the government army continued to advance victoriously and occupied the town of Cijorna, capturing sixty-one Italian soldiers. According to our correspondent Rolling, the government army on the Guadalajara front continued to advance victoriously today. In the morning, they first occupied the town of Barrilete Hida (15 kilometers north of the town of Brihuega), and in the afternoon, they attacked and captured the town of Gollocho (20 kilometers north of the town of Brihuega). The resistance of the National Army was very weak. As a result of today's battle, 74 Italian soldiers were captured. Corpses were strewn all over the battlefield, including an Italian staff officer from the National Army headquarters, and many soldiers who were not wearing the uniforms of foreign troops and the Italian regular army. In addition, the government army also took offensive actions in the area of Alunren City in the southeast of the capital, which was quite successful. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 21st)

⊙ Madrid - The newspapers here compared the defeat of the National Army on the Guadalajara front to the disastrous defeat of the Italian army in the Battle of Caporetto during the European War. The Reuters special correspondent inspected the Guadalajara front and believed that there were indeed some reasons to compare. It is said that he saw in Dorica the war supplies captured by the government army, including field guns, cars and trucks. He drove along the Zaragoza highway, passing through Trigueque, and saw backpacks, water bottles, hand grenades, guns, bullets, food and gasoline barrels scattered on both sides of the road. A government army officer interrogated several Italian prisoners and told the special correspondent that most of the Italian soldiers were civilians who could not withstand the severe cold on the Guadalajara front last week. The government army is both hardworking and has sophisticated military equipment. The victory of the government army this time is mostly due to the power of tanks. The government army's air force drove away enemy planes and used machine guns to eliminate many enemies. (Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 21st)

### The Government Army Captures Gollocho, Spain

Tanks Charge Unstoppably

⊙ Madrid - The government army on the Guadalajara front in the northeast of the capital continued to attack yesterday and immediately occupied the town of Gollocho. Regarding the details of the battle, it is reported that the National Army was stationed with heavy troops in the triangle formed by the three towns of Yera, Mazuecoso, and Gollocho. The government army divided its troops into three routes to attack these towns and used tanks to charge. As a result, the three towns were captured one by one. As a result of this battle, the government army's position has been advanced by five to seven kilometers. In addition, 60 Italian soldiers carrying weapons surrendered to the government army on the highway from the capital to Aragon. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 22nd)

Some Have Not Been Fully Trained

⊙ Algeciras - A thousand fascist irregular soldiers left here today for Ceuta to replace the Moorish soldiers. It is said that these people claimed that they were unwilling to go to the front to fight because they had not received sufficient training, and they preferred to stay to defend Morocco. According to a National Army officer today, foreigners currently account for 90% of General Franco's troops. (Reuters Dispatch from Gan Er, 22nd)

### The Garrison in Oviedo, Northwest Spain, Is Heavily Fortified

The Government Army Has Been Besieging for Several Days Without Success

⊙ Avila City - The city of Oviedo in the province of Asturias in the northwest has been besieged by the government army for many days and has not been captured. According to a report from our correspondent, the fighting there has now eased. The main reason why the government army stopped attacking is that the bad weather is not conducive to marching, but its ineffective combat is the main reason. It is reported that the government army originally assembled 35,000 soldiers on the front line there to carry out operations, all under the command of General Tomas, the commander of the front in the province of A. The military equipment they carried was extremely sharp, including 40 tanks, 200 cannons of various calibers, hundreds of mortars, thousands of machine guns, and a large number of hand grenades. However, after many days of fierce fighting, the losses were very large. General Tomas led the remnants and retreated from the front line yesterday, and a small number of sentries were left to guard the front line. Therefore, since yesterday, the two sides have only used artillery to bombard each other. General Aranda, the commander of the National Army in Oviedo, is still supervising the troops to build fortifications. The trenches and fortresses outside the city are like copper walls and iron walls, and there are also dugouts to hide from artillery fire. Even if the government army attacks again, it will be difficult to cross the thunder pool, he said. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 22nd)

If the police authorities do not agree to stop forcing the workers who are staging sit-down strikes to leave the factory, the general strike will be implemented.

### 80,000 Acres of Salt Flats in Eastern Tianjin Were Sold Illegally by Traitors

Yin Rugeng Interceded on Their Behalf, The Changlu Transport Office Is Dispatching Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate

Tianjin News, There are several pieces of deserted salt flats with a total area of 80,000 acres in the coastal area of Hangu and Xinhe in eastern Tianjin. Most of them belong to the Nantuo Land Company. Recently, through the contact of the traitor Yin Rugeng, they were resold to a certain party for more than 200,000 yuan. The seller's representative is the traitor Shao □□. All the conditions have been negotiated. After measurement, the transaction can be completed. The Changlu Salt Transport Office reported that the matter involves the illegal sale of the country, and specially sent personnel to the area to investigate the truth in order to verify and handle the matter. The details are as follows:

The situation of the salt flats

The salt flats in the Changlu salt area are completely concentrated in the Hangu, Xinhe, and Denggu areas east of Tanggu. The land is along the coast, and the salt workers are lined up. Near Hangu, from Beitang to Yingcheng, there are several deserted salt flats, most of which belong to the Shao family. Each has its own boundaries. Some Shao family members and other landlords jointly form the Nantuo Land Company for management. During the Guangxu and Xuantong years of the Qing Dynasty, a large amount of salt was produced here. Later, due to the oversupply of salt in Hangu and other places, and the quality of the salt was better than that in this area, the salt affairs authorities, in order to prevent the salt workers from fighting each other to the death, ordered the beach to be sealed off and not allowed to produce new salt again. Since then, a piece of empty beach has been abandoned. Because the land is along the coast and the soil is saline, agriculture cannot be harvested. Only reeds are luxuriant and self-harvesting. At the end of each autumn, the beach households sell the leaves and sell them to survive the winter. This is the general situation of the abandoned beach.

Traitors sell illegally The traitor Shao □□ is also a member of the Shao family. Recently, he was used by others to sell all the abandoned beach to a certain party. According to the investigation, a certain party has coveted the salt flats there for a long time. After buying them, they can be used for two purposes: ㊀ to produce salt on the spot, ㊁ to harvest reeds to make paper. Dalian Dongyang Paper Industry Co., Ltd. has established a factory in Tianjin with a capital of 10 million yuan. The president of the company, Uchiyama Takashi, came to Tianjin from Dalian a few days ago to prepare. The products are all suitable for North China, mainly newspapers, Daolin paper, and Mao Bian paper. The factory site is located next to the Hai Guang Temple in Tianjin. It is scheduled to start manufacturing during the reed harvest period this year (around November). It is planned to produce 24 million pounds per year. The reeds produced by the abandoned beach every year are the main raw material for papermaking, which is sufficient for the Dongyang Paper Company's annual use.

Yin's maneuvering

Last summer, the traitor Shao □□ proposed to contact a certain party to sell illegally. Due to unfavorable conditions, it was once suspended. However, a certain party's intention to purchase has not diminished. Yin Rugeng, in view of the fact that Xinhe and Hangu are close to "Jidong", in order to ingratiate himself with a certain party, specially ran around for both parties. After repeated discussions, it was agreed that the price per acre would be 23.5 yuan. Recently, the consent of both parties was obtained. The traitor Shao □□ himself has recently sneaked from Hangu to Tianjin, hiding in a certain concession, and met with a certain party to make a final decision. Once a certain party sends personnel to measure the wasteland, a contract can be signed. It is also heard that the wasteland is close to the sea. Not only can it produce salt and harvest reeds to make paper, but it is also very profitable. It can also be used for fishing, building camps and stationing troops, and is a strategically useful terrain facing Dagu from a distance.

Investigation by the Transport Office

The Changlu Salt Transport Office reported that a certain party had previously demarcated four salt flats in Tanggu, surrounded by wooden stakes, and originally planned to offer prices to purchase from the beach households. However, because the beach households were unwilling to sell, they refused and stalemated for several months. A certain party was finally unable to get what he wanted and voluntarily removed the wooden stakes that had been occupied a few days ago, restoring the original state. This dispute has just been resolved, and now there is Shao's illegal sale of wasteland. The matter involves the illegal sale of land, and a special commissioner has been sent to the site to investigate the truth in order to verify and handle the matter. The beach households in the Hangu area are also afraid that if the wasteland is bought by a certain party, and once the salt ponds are opened and sold at low prices, they will not be able to resist, which is tantamount to putting them to death. In addition to uniting the powerful landlords in Yingcheng and Beitang to firmly oppose it, they also plan to request the authorities to issue an order to stop it. (20th)

### Rampant Outflow of Chaozhou-Meixian Copper Coins

Copper Coin Prices Rise Daily; Millions Smuggled Out

Shantou Correspondence: Copper coins, commonly used in the Chaozhou-Meixian market, are now gradually depleting. Transactions and change are becoming scarce everywhere. Last winter, one silver dollar could be exchanged for 360 coins. The price has been steadily rising, reaching 280 coins in February of this year, 250 in March, and currently only 220 coins per dollar in various inland counties due to a shortage of copper coins and the non-circulation of auxiliary currency notes (due to the impact of counterfeit notes by Japanese). However, unscrupulous merchants continue to smuggle them out in large quantities. The price in Hong Kong is 160 copper coins per Hong Kong dollar. Foreign firms value them by weight, with 140 coins exchanging for one Hong Kong dollar. Each Hong Kong dollar can be exchanged for 1.2 silver dollars in Shantou. Smuggling merchants can earn a net profit of five jiao (cents) of silver per dollar. The Chaozhou Customs Anti-Smuggling Department has recently been strictly investigating smuggled goods. All armed patrol teams are deployed along the coast. Starting this month, 40,000 copper coins have been seized (90,000 catties seized last month have already been sent to Shanghai). However, a large number have slipped through the net. The outflow of copper coins is like a river flowing downwards, unstoppable, as can be seen. It is heard that a certain country's electric vessel anchors at night near the outer sand and grass islands of Chenghai, specifically to transport copper coins and tungsten ore for export, to be used as raw materials for manufacturing military supplies in that country. Speaking solely of Chaozhou-Meixian, the outflow of copper coins has reached one million coins. The government's seizures are less than one-tenth of the total. On the evening of the 17th, the Shantou Anti-Smuggling Department also seized 600 copper coins on a boat near Niaoju Pan. The case has been reported to the provincial government for review and handling. According to investigations in Chaoan, after breaking up a large opium den some days ago, they also arrested eight or nine people for smuggling copper coins and tungsten ore, and have already sent them to Shantou for transfer to the province for punishment. In addition to intercepting imported opium and exported copper coins, the Customs also seized a batch of silver articles on the 18th belonging to more than ten jewelry merchants, including Xie Yisheng, who were colluding with the Taikoo Steam Navigation Company to smuggle them out. It is evident that unscrupulous merchants are not only smuggling copper coins but also secretly plundering and exporting all kinds of metal implements. Even amidst strict investigations, smuggling continues unabated, which is truly lamentable.

### Severe Spring Famine in Northern Anhui Counties

Grain Prices Soar; Disaster Victims Lack Food; Refugees Fill Roads, Urgent Relief Needed

Bengbu Correspondence: Northern Anhui, located in the Huai River basin, has fertile soil and abundant agricultural production, and is known as a prosperous region. However, due to frequent disasters and repeated droughts and floods, rural areas have become desolate and people cannot make a living. Last spring there was a severe famine, and in the autumn there was a prolonged drought. The affected area covers nearly twenty counties. There was a poor harvest, and grain prices soared. People's livelihoods are becoming increasingly difficult. In the famine-stricken areas, there are cries of sorrow everywhere, and deaths occur one after another. By the severe winter, people were suffering from hunger and cold. Many have taken to desperate measures. In remote rural areas, bandits are rampant. Murder and robbery occur everywhere. Crisis lurks everywhere, with hardly any safe haven. Now, in the spring, the misfortune has not subsided. Rural areas are barren, and farmers are displaced. The disaster is even more evident. The sale of farm cattle, which are being transported out of the area to Shanghai for slaughter, is proof of the bankruptcy of rural areas in northern Anhui counties. The disaster area has turned into a spring famine. According to investigations, the disaster is most severe in Su County, Mengcheng, Guoyang, Taihe, and Bo County, with Huoqiu, Fuyang, Linquan, Yingshang, Shou County, and Fengtai counties being the next most affected. In addition, the three counties of Fengyang, Huaiyuan, and Lingbi in the suburbs of Bengbu are also filled with refugees and desolation. Disaster victims are crying out, urgently awaiting relief. At this time, the spring famine is widespread, and people's wealth is exhausted, while grain prices are unusually high, the highest in decades. For example, high-quality wheat sells for 18.3 silver dollars per shi (a unit of dry measure), and soybeans also sell for over 14 silver dollars per shi. If this continues, people's food supply is threatened. In the disaster areas lacking food, poor people mostly eat bitter herbs, coarse bran, tree bark, and wheat sprouts as food to fill their stomachs. The severity of the disaster is almost comparable to last spring. Surviving inhabitants of northern Anhui consider Bengbu, which connects north and south, as a major market on the Huai River, with a large population and easier opportunities for begging. As a result, they are leaving their miserable and impoverished villages in droves and coming to Bengbu to escape the famine. The once-thriving town of Bengbu has become the end of the line for disaster victims. In the main streets and back alleys, one often sees gaunt and helpless disaster victims, supporting the old and carrying the young, begging from door to door, exposed to the wind and sleeping in the open, like a picture of refugees. The local beggar shelter is too small and limited by funds, and can only accommodate two or three hundred people, far from enough. People generally hope that philanthropists will provide spring relief to benefit the disaster victims. (21st)

### Taicang

Public Official Causes Trouble Watching a Play

The fire brigades in the urban and rural areas of this county, due to a lack of funds, specially requested and obtained approval from the county authorities to invite the Zhang Ji Grand Stage to perform Peking Opera at the Qunle Theater, starting on the 17th, with any surplus funds going to each branch. Because it was a public welfare matter, no complimentary tickets were issued. For several days, a man claiming to be Zhang Xuetao, a special agent of the Jiangsu Provincial Government from Pei County, accompanied by two assistants, Dong and Chen, requested free admission, which was denied. On the night of the 20th, a Saturday, the audience was particularly crowded. Shortly after the performance began, Zhang and his party, accompanied by a certain captain and soldiers, arrived again. The organizers, seeing the situation, allowed them in. The three of them each occupied a first-class seat, while the rest were seated in the back rows. Because the theater sold tickets with assigned seating, the three seats were soon purchased by other customers. The ushers requested Zhang and his party to give up the seats, offering to arrange three other seats near the original ones. Unexpectedly, Zhang and his party, without asking why, punched and beat the ushers, and directed those who appeared to be soldiers to assist in the violence. The order was disrupted in an instant. Yang Meilin, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and other on-site staff of the fire brigade tried their best to mediate, but were all beaten. It took half an hour to finally separate them. Yuan Kejian, a standing committee member of the county party branch, invited Zhang and his party to rest upstairs at the Meiyuan Restaurant outside. Unexpectedly, Zhang and his party, still enraged, went directly into the kitchen of the restaurant, grabbed two vegetable knives, and brandished them downstairs. Mei Laoer, a member of the fire brigade, stepped forward to dissuade them and had five fingers cut. The audience, fearing a major incident, swarmed forward to knock Zhang and his party down, and tied them up with ropes for fear they would commit further violence. Fang Shixu, the secretary of the county government, and Hu Jun, a judge, were also present watching the play and witnessed the whole thing. They took Zhang and his party to the county, and immediately opened a preliminary hearing, ordering them to be detained in the Public Security Bureau detention center. Another trial was scheduled for the afternoon of the 21st. People from all walks of life were outraged and jointly telegraphed the provincial authorities requesting a severe punishment.

On the morning of the 22nd, District Chief Deng of the district personally came to the city to meet with County Magistrate Deng, reporting the details of the farmers' rent resistance and disturbance. In addition to ordering District Chief Deng to return to the township immediately to summon the baojia heads for admonition and guidance, County Magistrate Deng urgently telegraphed the Jiaozhi Police Station to quickly arrest the farmers who were the ringleaders of the incident and, after verifying the facts, send them to the Second Special District Commissioner's Office in Wuxi for severe punishment according to the law.

Mayor Wu Transferred to Be Chairman of Guangdong

### Municipal Party Headquarters and Other Organizations Send Telegrams to the Central Government to Retain Him

Telegrams Sent to the Central Political Council and the Executive Yuan to Approve the Withdrawal of the Order to Transfer Him to Guangdong

The Municipal Party Headquarters and other organizations, upon learning that Mayor Wu will be transferred to the Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, sent telegrams to the Central Political Council and the Executive Yuan, requesting his retention. The original text of each telegram is recorded below:

Municipal Party Headquarters: Yesterday's telegram to the Central Government said, "Respected Central Political Council and Executive Yuan, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng has been in office for six years, and his administration has been continuously improving. During the difficult and dangerous times, he has shown his ability to respond effectively, enabling party and government cooperation and unity from top to bottom, and construction has made progress. Public opinion has praised him. Suddenly, we heard that the Central Government intended to transfer him away from Shanghai to take charge of Guangdong's politics. The Central Government has its own considerations in assessing talent and assigning positions, but the local government cannot remain silent about a capable person being in power. We still hope that he will be retained to meet the expectations of the people. We are extremely grateful. The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Committee of the Kuomintang kowtows. Yang Yin.

Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Yesterday's special telegram to the Executive Yuan said, "Respected President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, Mayor Tiecheng has been in Shanghai for six years, with grand plans and arduous reforms. Both officialdom and the public, both Chinese and foreigners, admire and trust him. Shanghai is the support of the capital and the center of finance and taxation. The importance of Fufeng and Fengyi in the Han Dynasty is not enough to describe its importance. Now there is news of his appointment to Guangdong. Although the South needs talent and is a service to the country, the unfinished facilities in Shanghai are worrying about being abandoned. Not daring to intrude, we respectfully request a delay in his transfer. We hope that you will consider and approve this request. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows. Ma.

Municipal Federation of Trade Unions: Yesterday's telegram to the Central Government said, "Respected Central Executive Committee and National Government, upon hearing the news that our city's Mayor Wu Tiecheng has been ordered to take charge of Guangdong's politics, we are extremely dismayed. When Mayor Wu took office, he immediately encountered the January 28th Incident. The city was in decline, and all industries were withered. In this difficult and dangerous situation, Mayor Wu worked hard to maintain stability, worked diligently to govern, and all new constructions were still gradually promoted. He also eliminated labor disputes, stabilized industry and commerce, implemented the New Life Movement, strictly enforced discipline, maintained public order, banned gambling and drugs, and made overall plans. The achievements of his administration have won the support of the people of Shanghai. Now, he is also advocating Shanghai's frugality in order to reform customs, eliminate superstitions, and establish the spirit of a modern country, which is especially praised by people from all walks of life. We were hoping to continue his leadership and achieve these goals when we suddenly heard about his transfer. We are reluctant to let him go. Therefore, we urgently submit this petition and humbly ask that the Central Government (Government) respect public opinion, approve the withdrawal of the order to transfer him to Guangdong, and find another capable person to take charge of Guangdong's politics. We anxiously await your order. The Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions kowtows. And, it is understood that the National Postal Workers' Union and other trade unions will also send telegrams to the Central Government requesting the withdrawal of the order.

Municipal Farmers' Association: (Title omitted) The news that Mayor Tiecheng will succeed as Chairman of Guangdong Province has been reported, and the news has been received with extreme anxiety. Our city is the most prosperous in the country, with trade between China and foreign countries and the convergence of all parties. It is necessary to have a capable person in charge to cope with the situation. Since Mayor Wu Tiecheng took office, he has been deeply in line with public opinion. Not only are the citizens loving and supportive, but foreigners also praise him. We are hoping that he will show his strengths and seek welfare for the people of Shanghai. Why let him leave and lose the hearts of the people? We respectfully telegram to retain him and humbly ask for your approval. We anxiously await your response. The Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association kowtows. Yang Yin.

Municipal Education Association: (Title omitted) Having read the newspaper report that the Central Government intends to transfer Mayor Wu to Guangdong, we are extremely dismayed. Since Mayor Wu took charge of Shanghai, he has been actively promoting and planning all aspects of municipal administration, and his achievements are remarkable. He has especially put great effort into education. We telegram to retain him and sincerely ask him to continue to lead Shanghai and complete his grand plans. We are extremely grateful. The Shanghai Municipal Education Association kowtows. Yang Yin.

Municipal Federation: (Title and Seal) The news that Mayor Wu Tiecheng has been transferred to the Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government and will be announced by order immediately has been received with great anxiety. Since Mayor Tiecheng took charge of Shanghai, he has built a great Shanghai and prospered the city, and he has spared no effort in supporting industry and commerce. All the merchants and people in the city are deeply dependent on him. At this time when various undertakings are making rapid progress, it is even more necessary to have a capable person to plan, and he must not be allowed to leave. The Central Government certainly attaches importance to the politics of Guangdong and has given him an important task, but our city is the focus of attention at home and abroad and is also more important. Therefore, we sincerely request that he be retained and hope that you will respect public opinion and comfort the people of the city who are looking forward to it. The First and Second Special District Citizens' Federation of Shanghai kowtows. Yang Yin.

More Than 100 Associations: More than 100 trade associations in our city, including the salted fish industry, jointly telegrammed the Central Government yesterday, saying, "Respected National Government, we are surprised to read in the newspapers that our city's Mayor Wu Tiecheng will be transferred to Guangdong by order of the Central Government. Mayor Wu has been stationed in Shanghai for six years. The stability of the economy, the promotion of education, the prosperity of the city, the handling of diplomacy, the construction of a great Shanghai, and the restoration of industry and commerce have all depended on Mayor Wu's hard work and planning. We were hoping that it would take shape and progress step by step, continue the unfinished work of the Prime Minister, and follow the leader's intention to build, working diligently and being loved by the people. Especially during the January 28th Shanghai War, he was able to support the dangerous situation and turn danger into safety. He was also able to maintain public order, ban smoking and gambling, and make overall plans. His integrity and fairness have made the cowardly stand up and the wicked hide. All these things are due to Mayor Wu's leadership over the years. How can we bear to part with him when we hear about his transfer? We have always admired your kindness to the people and believe that you will be able to understand public opinion and follow public opinion to withdraw the order immediately. It will not only be the blessing of our business community. We anxiously await your order. Salted fish, fresh fish, ham, fishing boats, fruits, seafood, dried goods, preserved meat, noodle restaurants, flowers and trees, sand boats, sand and stones, fishing boats, sand transportation, Chinese and foreign groceries, Western clothing, cosmetics, bamboo industry, local wine, sauce wine, tea, paint industry, glass, Hongxiu oil factory industry, mechanized coal ball industry, underwear weaving industry, fruit transportation industry, medicine industry, timber industry, rayon industry, pawnshop industry, fresh pig slaughtering, fresh pig selling, silver building industry, Chinese candle industry, Chinese alkali industry, pickled vegetable industry, leather shoe nailing industry, radio industry, inland river shipping industry, wine and food industry, etc. 179 trade associations. Horse.

Middle School Federation: Respected President Jiang of the National Government's Executive Yuan, Shanghai's major newspapers reported that our city's Mayor Wu will be promoted to Chairman of Guangdong Province due to the death of Chairman Huang of the Guangdong Provincial Government. The country assesses talent and appoints officials, and the people are grateful. However, Mayor Wu has been in charge of Shanghai's politics for many years, and his achievements are well-known both in China and abroad. He should be retained in his position for a long time so that he can fully develop his grand plans. We ask that you allow him to stay in office and comfort the people. We humbly ask for your consideration. The Shanghai Municipal Middle School Federation kowtows. Yang Yin.

### Commander Yang Fetes Ambassador Xu Yesterday

Welcome Meeting by Anhui Compatriots in Shanghai

A Central News Agency report states that Yang Hu, Garrison Commander of Shanghai and Songhu, hosted a banquet last night at 7 PM at the International Hotel for Xu Shiying, and invited Shangguan Yunxiang, Xiao Zhenying, Wang Pengsheng, Ma Zhanshan, Chuan Bingchang, Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Xinzhi, and others to accompany them. During the banquet, Commander Yang gave a welcome speech, saying, "Ambassador Xu, distinguished representatives, ladies, and gentlemen, today, because our respected senior Anhui figure, Ambassador Xu, has returned to China to report on his duties, the Anhui associations in Shanghai are holding this welcome meeting to express their respect for the Ambassador. We are deeply honored by the Ambassador's gracious presence. The Ambassador was sent as an envoy to the East last year when Sino-Japanese relations were at their most tense. The Ambassador accepted his mission at a time of national crisis and resolutely shouldered the heavy responsibility. Now, a year has passed, and the situation of Sino-Japanese relations before us is obviously very different from when the Ambassador first took office. Generally speaking, it has gradually shifted from impulsiveness to calmness. The neighboring country has shifted from military force to economics. We in China have shown an indomitable spirit through many facts. In this, the Ambassador has worked diligently for the country and has spent much effort to turn the nation's situation from danger to safety and the national spirit from weakness to strength. This is our primary reason for welcoming and paying tribute to the Ambassador for the sake of national security. Secondly, our Anhui seniors who bear the great expectations of the country are all 'old and ever vigorous.' Recently, there was a period of governance, and the 'fruit remains healthy.' There is Ambassador Xu. When the Ambassador was commissioned last year, diplomats and politicians alike felt that the Ambassador's responsibility was extremely arduous. However, the Ambassador resolutely accepted the mission and ultimately transformed the dangerous situation that hung by a thread invisibly. This could not have been done without 'supreme benevolence and virtue.' This is our second reason for welcoming Ambassador Xu for the honor of our Anhui compatriots. In short, the Ambassador is a pillar of the country and a model for Anhui. I cannot express even one ten-thousandth of the admiration in my heart. Finally, I wish the Ambassador boundless happiness and eternal prosperity for the country." Toasts were exchanged, and the guests departed joyfully at around 9 PM. A New Voice Agency report states that Ambassador Xu Shiying, the resident ambassador to Japan, is scheduled to take the through train to Ping tomorrow night at 12 o'clock to pay his respects to Duan Qirui. He will return south on the first of next month and then pass through Beijing again to meet with President Jiang and Foreign Minister Wang to ascertain their views. It may be possible to cancel his resignation, but this will depend on further meetings with President Jiang and Foreign Minister Wang. In addition to attending banquets hosted by Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu and members of the Japanese economic survey mission, Etsukichi Shoji, last night, Xu also attended a public banquet held by Anhui associations and other Anhui organizations. The details are as follows:

Public Banquet by Compatriots. The Anhui Shanghai Compatriots Association, Hui Ning Compatriots Association, Hui Ning Guild Hall, Luzhou Five Prefecture Compatriots Association, Anhui Huai River Advancement Association, Yingzhou Seven County Compatriots Association, Shanghai Anhui Mutual Aid Society, Xingjiang Dunzi Hall, Fulin Compatriots Association, Ningguo Compatriots Association, Nanling Compatriots Association, Jixi Compatriots Association, Wuyuan Compatriots Association, Shexian Compatriots Association, Xiuning Compatriots Association, Qimen Compatriots Association, Yixian Compatriots Association, Jingxian Compatriots Association, Taiping Compatriots Association, Taihe Compatriots Association, Hui Ning Elementary School, Anhui Middle School People's Elementary School, Huiling Middle School, and other organizations hosted a banquet at the Atlantic Restaurant yesterday at 7 PM to welcome Ambassador Xu. Xu Shiying, Huang Bodu, Yang Hu, Wang Jiyi, He Xiaohuan, Li Jianbai, Wang Zhaopeng, Cheng Haifeng, Wang Yucheng, Xu Bolong, Hu Puan, Li Zhengqiu, Lü Yin’nan, Huang Yuding, Yu Gumin and over a hundred other people attended. Yang Hu presided over the event.

Chairman's Speech. During the banquet, Chairman Yang Hu gave a speech, saying, "Ambassador Xu, Secretary Huang, fellow compatriots, since Ambassador Xu was appointed to Japan last year, he has used his usual dedication to the country and society to work diligently for the nation, bringing Sino-Japanese relations closer. This is not only the glory of our country and nation but also the glory of our Anhui compatriots. This time, the Ambassador has returned to China to report on his duties, and our 24 Shanghai associations are holding this banquet to welcome him. I hope that the Ambassador will continue to uphold his original intention and win honor for the country. I offer a toast to the health and efforts of Ambassador Xu and Secretary Huang."

Mr. Xu's Response. Xu Shiying then responded, saying, "Chairman, fellow compatriots, I am unworthy of this welcoming banquet. I was ordered to serve as ambassador to Japan on March 6th of last year and returned to China on March 6th of this year. During this year, the relations between the two countries can be divided into four periods in my personal perception. From March to July of last year was a period of chaos. The Chengdu incident was a period of tension. The Xi'an Incident was a period of fear. Only after Chairman Jiang returned to Luoyang did the situation begin to improve, giving the Japanese government and public a new understanding. The progress of diplomacy depends entirely on the assistance and implementation of domestic policies. I believe that nothing in the world can be separated from justice and sincerity. Therefore, during my tenure, I have always handled diplomacy with justice and sincerity. Thanks to the government's wise guidance, I was able to avoid failure. The strength of Japan is also not accidental. The country always prioritizes the concentration of talent. If we want to make our country stronger, we should support our leader and strive to realize our established national policies." Subsequently, Wang Yucheng and others gave speeches, and the event concluded joyfully at around 9 PM.

The United States has also recently requested items from us. According to a reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency, Oberlephorpe University in the United States recently built a large-scale Peace Memorial Hall and is simultaneously soliciting historical culture and special products from various countries for display. The school has specially established a Chinese Special Products Exhibition Room for our country to display various special products.

Chinese trade has always been prosperous, and the display of special products is extremely beneficial to the export of our country's products. After receiving the order, the International Trade Bureau has separately solicited from various manufacturers.

### Truth About Rōnin Smuggling and Assaulting Customs Officers, Ministry of Finance Sends Personnel to Shanghai for Thorough Investigation

Baron's Report to Be Drafted and Submitted to Authorities Today, Rōnin Continued to Provoke, Almost Leading to Another Conflict the Night Before Last, Thirteen Shanghai Customs Officers Departed North to Tianjin Yesterday for Smuggling Suppression

According to the Shenzhou News Agency, since the incident of Japanese and Korean rōnin smuggling copper coins for export and violently assaulting customs officers, these people are still preparing to continue their secret smuggling. Customs officers, in view of the seriousness of the situation, issued a declaration the other day. The Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance has sent personnel to Shanghai for thorough investigation. The future of this matter is now unfolding. The details are recorded as follows:

Mereba Inquires About the Truth. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency made a special visit to Meredith, Commissioner of Customs, yesterday to inquire about the development of the incident on the morning of the 20th, when rōnin armed and smuggled copper coins and injured customs officers. According to him, the declaration of customs officers was only seen in the newspapers. He has not yet received the official report from Customs Commissioner Barron on the rōnin beating customs officers on Saturday and Sunday of last week, so he is unwilling to make any comments for the time being. Meredith then called Barron to inquire about everything. According to Barron on the phone, the report has not yet been drafted, but the facts are not as serious as rumored.

Ministry of Finance Sends Personnel to Shanghai for Thorough Investigation. Reliable sources also revealed that the Ministry of Finance Customs Administration, after learning of this matter, believed that smuggling was rampant in Shanghai, and that its nature was serious, even more so than in North China. It has sent personnel to Shanghai, who will conduct a thorough investigation with Meredith and others within days, and discuss measures to suppress it. Customs Commissioner Barron was originally scheduled to visit Meredith yesterday afternoon to make an oral report, but because Meredith called him first, he made a brief report on the phone. The report is now being drafted by Barron based on the report of Deputy Inspector Alexander, who witnessed the situation at the time. It should be completed today and submitted to Meredith for forwarding to the Ministry of Finance for review.

Rōnin Provocations Almost Leading to Another Conflict. Japanese and Korean rōnin smuggling copper coins has long become an open secret, and conflicts with customs officers have occurred from time to time. Ultimately, because the rōnin are numerous and rely on their numbers, and have people supporting them behind the scenes, the violent assault on the 20th was inevitable, not accidental. Although a very small portion was turned over under the mediation of the Japanese consulate last time, it was only allowed to be temporarily kept by customs in name. The Japanese consulate and the Taiyo Maru can take it back at any time. After the assault, the attitude of the Japanese and Korean rōnin became even more arrogant, so that the staff of the customs who went to work at the Huishan Wharf every night were constantly under threat and had no way to deal with it. It is said that the rōnin once provoked customs officers the night before last, and the customs officers were able to avoid a second conflict only by maintaining a tolerant attitude. However, if this continues without a comprehensive solution, the future is unimaginable.

Thirteen Customs Officers Went to North China Yesterday. Since smuggling is rampant again in the Yangtze River basin, the number of customs officers has been expanded from 300 to 360-70. At the same time, customs officers have also been stationed at major railway stations such as Beijing and Shanghai. During the period when smuggling was rampant in North China, fifty or sixty people were sent from Shanghai Customs. It is now learned that these customs officers are still insufficient, so Gu Renmin, Tang Guoliang, Li Kekuan, Lin Tang and other thirteen people were sent from Shanghai yesterday. Gu and others took the Shanghai-Ping through train north on the same day.

### Shangguan Yunxiang Returned to Shanghai Yesterday After Returning to China After Inspecting Military Affairs in Europe

Said He Travelled Throughout Europe Inspecting for a Year, Will Go to Beijing in a Few Days to Meet with Chairman Chiang

A Central News Agency report states that General Shangguan Yunxiang, who was sent to Europe to inspect the military equipment of various countries, went abroad last year and has been gone for a year. Now that his mission has been completed, he returned to China last month and passed through Shanghai. At the invitation of Yu Hanmou, Pacification Commissioner of Guangdong Province, he went to Guangdong for sightseeing. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 10:30 AM from Hong Kong on the Dutch ship Zinigara. He is scheduled to go to Beijing in a few days to meet with Chairman Chiang to report. A Central News Agency reporter visited Shangguan at his private residence. According to him, the gains from this inspection are as follows:

Inspection Covered Europe. I was ordered by Chairman Chiang last year to go to Europe to inspect military affairs for reference. The original inspection period was six months. After arriving in Europe, because of the urgency of time, I could not go to all countries for inspection, so I requested an extension of six months. On this trip to Europe, I went to Germany, Italy, Britain, France, Czechoslovakia, and other countries. Except for the Soviet Union and the small countries of the Balkan Peninsula, I traveled almost all over Europe. I inspected in detail the military equipment of various countries and the current situation of heavy industry. I will release the gains from the inspection on the military side after meeting with Chairman Chiang.

Germany and Italy Revere Leaders. Shangguan continued to talk about his impressions of this trip, saying that he found the inspections in Germany and Italy the most interesting. After Germany's defeat in World War I, the country was chaotic and the economy declined to the extreme. After sixteen years of struggle, it has now regained its former prestige in Europe. Examining Germany's recovery, the greatest reason for its rapid recovery is that the whole country can consistently support its leader, and ultimately rely on Hitler's leadership to achieve today's achievements. When I was in Germany, I asked my German friends whether the Germans sincerely supported Hitler. According to the answer, in the current environment in Germany, there must be a leader to lead the national people to struggle. The whole country's love and support for the leader is really enviable. Italy's international status is increasing day by day, also due to the support of the national people for the leader Mussolini. Therefore, if our country wants to revive the nation, we must also follow the determination of the German and Italian people to support their leaders.

### Completion of River Dredging and Embankment Construction Project After Labor Service Implementation in This City

Labor Service Association Scheduled to Conclude Next Month; Implementation of Labor Conscription Awaiting Municipal Government Decision

Since the Municipal Government of this city initiated winter labor service on December 19th of last year, the river dredging and embankment construction projects in various districts are nearing completion and are scheduled to conclude in early April. The labor conscription plan for this city will be implemented after a decision is made by the Municipal Government. The details of each aspect are recorded as follows:

Labor Projects: After the Municipal Government followed the winter labor service regulations established by the Military Affairs Commission, it formulated a plan dividing the city into ten districts. It temporarily conscripted over 60,000 able-bodied men from within each district, commencing labor service on December 19th of last year. To date, the rivers that have been dredged and the embankments that have been constructed include: ㊀ Zhanghuabang and Shengjiabang in the Wusong District; ㊁ Yuanchang River, E'chanpu, and Qianjiabang in the Yinhang District; ㊂ Xietang in the Jiangwan District; ㊃ Yangshupu and the western section of Qiujiang in the Yinxiang District; ㊄ Mudugang and Qiujiang Taopu in the Zhenru District; ㊅ The southern section of the Shahe River and Shuangyanggang in the Pusong District; ㊆ Shang'aotang in the Caojing District; ㊇ The southern section of Huangtonggang, Qingpu Port, Xingang, and Dongtang Tutang in the Gaoqiao District; ㊈ Hutangbang, Xiantangbang, Zhuangshupu, and Hengbang in the Gaohang District; and ㊉ Zhujiagou and the Majiabang Dike in the 44th map of the Luhang District. A total of twenty-two locations.

Extension of Closing Date: The winter labor service project for river dredging and embankment construction was originally scheduled to be completed and closed by the end of March of this year. According to Mr. Hong Qi, the chief executive of the association, speaking to a reporter from Dagong News, the labor service in this city, which began successively in various districts in December of last year, was affected by the weather. The water pumped from the rivers and streams was replenished by rainfall, causing delays in the dredging work. It is currently estimated that the completed projects in various districts account for seventy to eighty percent of the total. The unfinished projects are still underway. Therefore, the original closing date at the end of this month will be extended to early next month to allow for completion.

Labor Conscription: Regarding "labor conscription," since the Executive Yuan issued a nationwide order, various provinces and cities have successively implemented it upon receiving the order and have achieved good results. However, this city has not yet carried it out. According to Chief Executive Hong, this service is broad in scope, permanent in nature, and includes road construction, construction, sanitation, and so on. Labor service, on the other hand, is limited to agricultural off-seasons and is temporary in nature. Therefore, the implementation of labor conscription in this city must await a decision from the Municipal Government before it can proceed.

### Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association Appeals Again for Pond Repair

Du Yuesheng Expresses Grave Concern: Related to the Lives of 100,000 People

The Gaoqiao seawall has suffered from disrepair over the years, riddled with sores and holes. Since the beginning of spring, wind and rain have intensified the dangers. The narrowest point is only two chi (Chinese foot) of soil, and it is truly in imminent danger of collapse. Nearby residents are running around in fear, not knowing what tomorrow will bring. The Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association, recognizing that the seawall affects the safety of the entire district's population, and fearing the consequences of any accident, has, through its president Mr. Du Yuesheng, sent a letter to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, urgently requesting the allocation of funds for emergency repairs to alleviate the suffering and ensure the safety of the people. The original letter is reproduced below: To the esteemed Director Shen of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works: I am writing to you regarding the Gaoqiao seawall, which is located in a crucial area with swift currents. The embankment is also thin and has suffered from disrepair for many years, resulting in numerous holes and dangerous conditions. Last autumn, the tides flooded, and the residents were running around in fear, almost unable to protect themselves. Yuesheng witnessed this and was heartbroken, and he appealed to your bureau last September for urgent repairs. Half a year has passed since then, and the tides and rain have not ceased, exacerbating the dangers. Several dozen zhang (Chinese unit of length, about 3.3 meters) of the Longwangmiao, Shuitian Huangjiazhai, and Daijiazhai sections have collapsed, and seawater is almost connected to river water. The seawall, which is supposed to protect the lives of 100,000 people, is only two chi (Chinese foot) at its most dangerous point. With continuous spring rains, how can it withstand another onslaught? The yellow plum season is approaching, and residents who are not fish or shrimp are few. Therefore, they sigh and lament to each other, with no heart to farm. During the tides at midnight, they sit up anxiously waiting for dawn, and even the slightest breeze feels like needles piercing their skin. Their situation is pitiful, and their plight is lamentable. Moreover, the Gaoqiao seawall stretches for more than ten li (Chinese mile), and if anything happens, what will become of the lives of 100,000 people? I am compelled to write again, earnestly and respectfully, pleading with your bureau to recognize the urgency, carry out repairs as soon as possible, alleviate the suffering, and ensure the safety of the people. I am most grateful for your consideration. Respectfully, [Signature]

### Zhu Qinglan Cables Yesterday to Request Funds to Aid Disaster Areas in Henan

One Corner (Chinese currency) Can Sustain Half a Month of Life

Zhu Qinglan, Chairman of the Relief Committee, and Lu Bohong, Mu Ouchu, etc., went to Henan to investigate the disaster in Henan. Except for Mr. Lu, who had other important matters, who returned to Shanghai yesterday, Mr. Zhu telegraphed the United Charity Relief Association yesterday to allocate funds for relief, saying (the above is omitted) Clever telegram reached Brother Bohong, who returned to Shanghai earlier. I understand that. Lan et al. arrived in Luoyang in the morning and went to Yichuan for inspection. In the evening, they returned to Luoyang to hold a meeting and jointly decided to organize the Western Henan Relief Committee. Commissioner Wang Ba, Bishop Guo Fangwu, and the Shanghai commissioner were appointed as standing committee members with full power to preside over the relief matters. Fair people from all counties are responsible for assisting in the relief. At seven o'clock in the morning, he went to Dengfeng, crossed Yanshi, crossed the Luoshui River, and crossed the Eling Ridge for a journey of 150 li. On the way, he saw tens of thousands of victims, supporting the old and carrying the young, kneeling and begging for relief. Most of them are gaunt and haggard, and it is unbearable to witness. The disaster in Dengfeng is particularly severe. The population is more than 230,000, more than 100,000 are without food, about 60,000 are semi-starved, and deaths from starvation are heard every day. The food of the victims, grass roots and bark, is exhausted. Many people who eat stone powder suffer from disease and die. It is a human hell. How can we bear to witness it? Lan et al. were all tragic. According to the survey, one jiao (Chinese currency) of relief food can be mixed with other things to eat, which can maintain half a month of life.

### Lu Dingkui and Others Propose Automatically Abolishing Extraterritoriality

To Protect National Security, China Should Set a Deadline and Declare Abolition

Shens Times Agency reports that in the Xianfeng and Tongzhi years of the Qing Dynasty, China began to sign treaties and trade with various countries. At that time, because the Chinese people did not understand the foreign situation, they rashly allowed the treaty countries consular jurisdiction, resulting in huge mistakes and endless troubles for decades. Since the establishment of the National Government, it has been working hard to abolish consular jurisdiction. On the one hand, it has been actively completing various codes and establishing courts in various places, and on the other hand, the diplomatic authorities have been negotiating with various friendly countries. For example, the Sino-Polish Treaty of Commerce in the 18th year, the Sino-Greek Treaty of Commerce, the Sino-Mexican Treaty of Commerce, the Sino-Czech Treaty of Friendship and Commerce in the 19th year, and the later Sino-Turkish Treaty of Commerce, have all achieved the purpose of abolition. However, in the Sino-Belgian Treaty, the Sino-Italian Treaty, the Sino-Danish Treaty, and the Sino-Portuguese Treaty in the 17th year, although the text of the treaty contains clauses stipulating that the people of the two countries should be subject to the laws and courts of the contracting country, each country has separate annexes reserving the implementation of the clause, taking the 1922 Washington Treaty as the condition for the implementation of the condition of the abolition of all relevant countries. For several years, although the diplomatic authorities have repeatedly negotiated with major countries, they still hold a wait-and-see attitude, repeatedly shirking responsibility, and are unwilling to give up immediately, resulting in the abolition being far away. It is a major obstacle to China's legal rights, and its impact on the country and the nation is extremely significant. Lawyers in this city,

Lu Dingkui and others, in view of the urgency of the abolition of this system, especially suggested to the Shanghai Lawyers Association to request the government to invoke the precedents of the suspension of war debts to the United States by the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium, and declare that the reasons for not being able to continue to tolerate it, decide the date, and abolish it on its own. Their arguments are quite worthy of international public law, and the full text of the original proposal is recorded as follows: For the purpose of the proposal, I believe that the consular jurisdiction system damages the sovereignty of the country, hinders the unity of judicial power, and makes the people almost have no laws to protect foreigners who enjoy special rights. It has a great impact on the finance, military affairs, public security, and commerce of a country. The harm is unparalleled. It is comparable to territorial division. For decades, the country and the nation have suffered from its harm. It is difficult to describe in detail. At the beginning of the establishment of the National Government, it was based on

Equal Diplomacy. It once negotiated actively with countries that signed treaties to abolish the consular jurisdiction system. Although some friendly countries have already implemented abolition, all countries that claim to be first-class powerful countries, that is, those countries that have the deepest relationship with China, either are willing to give up, but are confused by the complaints of their expatriates, or they harbor more evil intentions and want to use this system to destroy the integrity of the country's power. They are all shirking responsibility and unwilling to implement it. Although some countries have signed abolition with attached conditions, after investigating the content of the treaty, they are all the same, and all other countries have added supervision. If the cancellation is cancelled, the country will also cancel it at the same time as the condition of its promise. Waiting for the date of its self-abolition is like waiting for the Yellow River to clear. If we investigate where they are, they only want to agree to cancel the agreement to implement their

Agreement Not to Cancel the original intention. If the country does not make great efforts to deal with this situation, it will not be able to achieve the goal of negotiation, and the harm that the country and the nation have suffered for decades will continue to evolve and never end. The country knows that the harm of this system is great, but it does not dare to abolish it on its own, because it believes that there is a restriction in the treaty. Without the consent of both parties, it should not act alone. Gu Yihui, a member, believes that it is not only that international public law has clear provisions that circumstances have changed and can be used as exceptions for a contracting country to abolish the obligations of the treaty on its own, but also that for ten years, the world's major powers have been responsible for the obligations of the treaty, and their nature is hundreds of times more important than this, and they often act on their own without asking for the consent of the countries concerned.

Declared Abolition, I don’t know how many times. To mention the most important ones, the debts owed by the Allied countries to the United States of America during the European War totaled about 200 million US dollars. After the war, the countries paid only a fraction, and by 1930, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Belgium successively notified the US government that they were unable to repay the debts and would stop paying them after that. Although the US government raised objections, they all ignored them. The Treaty of Paris stipulates that Germany should compensate the Allied countries for reparations. Because the Germans could not pay the full amount, they negotiated repeatedly.

Young Plan, finally there is only one promise to pay only one more time, but the result is that even this last installment, and Germany also refused to pay. The Treaty of Paris has detailed provisions regarding the restrictions on Germany's naval and army preparations and the non-garrisoning of the Rhine River region. However, the Germans openly expanded their military preparations and built warships on a large scale the year before, exceeding the restrictions of the treaty by several times. Last year, the German divisions marched into the Rhine River region while singing loudly. The Covenant of the League of Nations is a treaty jointly signed by most countries in the world to mutually guarantee security and maintain peace. However, on September 18, 1931, the Empire of Japan, a member of the League of Nations, destroyed the Covenant and sent troops to China. The remaining countries ignored the security provisions of the Covenant and did not follow the regulations to provide the invaded country with substantial assistance. The year before, Italy ignored the provisions of the Covenant and annexed the territory of another member country. Such things have happened repeatedly in the past few years, and all the major powers in the world have been involved. Since those powers themselves can abolish the obligations of the treaty at any time based on their own judgment, then our country can compare it with this treaty obligation of the powers. The importance of the Treaty of Paris (that is, the International Covenant) and the Allied War Debt Agreement is not the same. Of course, we can cite the precedents of the powers and declare its abolition on our own based on the principle of major changes in the situation. Members believe that the government should send a note to the countries that currently have consular jurisdiction, stating the reasons why China must immediately abolish this treaty.

Please agree to completely abolish it before a certain month and day. If no expression of agreement is obtained, then after the deadline, in order to protect its national security, the Chinese government has no choice but to declare its abolition on its own. Thereafter, regardless of nationality, expatriates, in China, whether on land or water, the Chinese government should actively exercise its judicial power. It only needs to be done in this simple way, and the negotiations that have not been resolved for decades can be effective at your fingertips, and only by using this method can we break the stalemate in which the powers shirk responsibility and make it difficult for China. Then, the consular jurisdiction system that has poisoned the country and society will have a day to be cleared. I believe that this association is located in an area where Chinese and foreigners gather, and we have witnessed the poisoning of this system most closely. For this reason, since the past ten years, we have repeatedly sent documents and memoranda to the government, petitioning for negotiations on abolition. Now that the country is in trouble and its demise is imminent, it is difficult to achieve rejuvenation without eliminating this system. Members are in danger and cannot remain silent. Therefore, I dare to contribute my humble opinions and propose to the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of this association to immediately send a telegram to the National Government and the Executive Yuan, requesting that it be adopted and implemented to protect the country's life. Is it appropriate? Please vote on it. Proposer: Lu Dingkui, Co-signers: Jiang Yong, Jiang Yiping, Zhang Zhirang, Cheng Xiuling, Wang Jiquan, Li Zuyu, Liu Chun, Liu Zhen, Gu Zukuan, Hua Xiangsheng, Zhang Shewo, Tang Shichang, Li Gengxiang, Tang Shizhen, Yao Qiming, Zhu Shifan.

### Young Daughter Bravely Alerts the Police, Three Thieves All Captured

The home of Qi Houqing on Avenue Foch Robbed Yesterday Afternoon; Police Express Gratitude to Young Daughter for Reporting the Crime

At around 12:00 noon yesterday, a robbery occurred at No. 3, Lin Sheng Fang, No. 461 Avenue Foch in the French Concession. A total of three thieves, carrying two wooden imitation pistols, first robbed about 100 yuan in national currency and gold and silver ornaments on the second floor. Just as they were about to go up to the third floor to search for more loot, the 15-year-old daughter of the victim took the opportunity to escape and report the crime. The police immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to surround and arrest the thieves. The three thieves were all captured on the spot, with no one escaping. Details are recorded below:

Residence of an Actor: No. 3, Lane 461, Avenue Foch in the French Concession is a single three-story shikumen house rented by Qi Houxiang (37 years old), a Qingjiang person who is the leader of a Peking opera troupe. He has been renting it for five years at a monthly rent of 60 yuan. Because Qi's family has a large number of people, he has not sublet it to others. Houqing himself is currently leading the entire troupe of performers in various parts of Yunnan. It is reported that the performance has ended and he is on his way back to Shanghai.

Sudden Appearance of Three Thieves: Yesterday at 12:30, just as Qi's family had finished their lunch and were sorting out miscellaneous items, three robbers suddenly broke in through the back door. Two of them spoke with a Jiangbei accent and wore blue cloth shirts and trousers. The other wore a Western-style overcoat. Two of the thieves were armed with pistols, and one of the thieves used the muzzle of his gun to point at the chest of Qi's wife, Deng (37 years old), and forbade her from making any noise. Then, they drove all eight men and women, young and old, in the house into a room on the first floor and began to search for loot.

Forced to Hand Over Keys: The three thieves first searched the first floor, robbing 71 yuan in national currency, a gold ring, and silver powder boxes, silk handkerchiefs, and other items, worth about 100 yuan in total. Seeing that there was nothing of value left, the thieves forced Deng to hand over the keys to the third-floor rooms and boxes. Ms. Deng refused slightly and was slapped several times by a thief. This was because Ms. Deng knew that there were a lot of clothes and ornaments stored on the third floor, and if the thieves went up to the third floor, the losses would be even greater.

Young Daughter Reports the Crime: Just as Ms. Deng was confronting the thieves, her 15-year-old daughter, Xiao Mao, took advantage of her mother and the thieves being distracted, and secretly went downstairs by herself and ran out of the back door. She happened to run into the bookkeeper who was collecting the rent, and together they ran to the Tongfu Road intersection to report to the patrol officer in charge of the traffic lights there. The patrol officer immediately reported to the Lujiawan French General Patrol Room by telephone.

### Detailed Account of the Tragic Death of the Bodyguard of Bei Runsheng

Attempting to Please Ends in Disaster; Temporary Anger Leads to Suicide

Li Jinlong, a Shandong native, 45 years old, the bodyguard employed by Bei Jiansheng, a wealthy merchant from Suzhou, at No. 5, Baoshan Lane, Route Belles, French Concession, suddenly shot himself in the head with his pistol in the garden of the Bei residence the day before yesterday at noon. The bullet penetrated his brain. After being discovered, the French police were notified. He was taken to the hospital by car, but due to the severity of the injury, he died. His body was sent to the morgue for examination. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, here is a supplementary account of Li's

Reasons for Suicide. Li was initially recommended by Li Yipeng, an official of the French Municipal Council, to Bei Runsheng and worked as a "Sigao Pu" (guard) in Baoshan Lane. Because Li was straightforward and loyal to his duties, he was deeply valued by his employer and was promoted to the position of bodyguard. He has served for over ten years. His salary has now increased to 38 yuan per month. Li has a wife, Zhang, who is the same age and from the same hometown. They have a son named Genrong, who is seven years old this year. Because they live frugally,

They Save Every Month. They have accumulated 1,600 yuan, which is deposited with the employer to earn interest. He originally lived in the residence, and his wife and children rented a place at No. 38, Daode Lane, Route Belles. Li always kept the deposit book with him. The misfortune began one evening in March of last year when Bei's second son and his wife went to the Dongfang Hotel to listen to storytelling, traveling by car. Li was ordered to follow and protect them. At that time, Li

Was Very Attentive, trying to please his employer by opening the car door. Unexpectedly, Li was careless and accidentally stepped on the young mistress's foot. The young mistress was in great pain and scolded him loudly. Li failed to please, received a mistake, and was reprimanded. He was still disgruntled and still followed the car home. Later, Bei's son and daughter-in-law complained to their mother, intending to dismiss Li. However, Bei's wife said that Li had been employed for more than ten years and had not made any major mistakes. If he was dismissed and went outside, she feared

Accidents Might Happen. Therefore, she did not agree to their request and continued to employ him as usual. But from then on, the employer gradually became cold towards Li, calling the other two bodyguards to follow him when he went out. This has been going on for a year. Li believed that his colleagues had been gossiping about him in front of his employer, causing him to be treated coldly. Therefore, for the past year, he had often been depressed and regretted it. On the 21st, at 11:00 AM, Li was in low spirits. He "learned that his beloved son had gone out to play and got lost, and his wife went to look for him."

Further Stimulated. He suddenly had thoughts of suicide. He first threw the pet parrot that he had been eating to the ground and stomped it to death. At that time, his wife had found his son and returned home. When Li saw his wife and son returning, he took out the deposit book from his body, threw it on the table, and said to his wife and son, "This is for you to live on." Then, he turned around and went outside. His wife and son feared that something would happen, so they followed Li to the gate of the Bei residence. Li said to his wife,

"Go Find the Master and talk to him," and went straight inside. At this time, Li went to Bei's garden and committed suicide. His wife waited at the gate for a long time and ordered her son to go inside with another child to look for him. Then, they found Li lying in the garden on the grass after shooting himself. Bei's residence immediately called the police station by phone and sent him to the hospital by car, but he died before he could be rescued. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, the police reported to the

Second Special Court. Prosecutor Wang and a forensic doctor arrived to verify that the deceased, Li Jinlong, died from a gunshot wound. After questioning his wife, he ordered that the body be handed over to his wife for burial. It is reported that the employer, Bei Runsheng, gave 600 yuan in compensation. However, the family is still seeking more. The body was placed in a coffin and stored in Hall C yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM.

### Diplomat Seeks Mediation for Divorce, Agreement Claimed Valid

Zhou Jingwan Intends to Deny Validity; Wang Gongxing's Request Denied; Consul's Wife Extremely Fashionable

Wang Gongxing, a native of Fenghua and Vice-Consul at the Chinese Consulate in Chicago, 29 years old, residing at No. 42, Model Village, Fuxu Road, married Zhou Jingwan (25 years old), a woman from Cixi, Ningbo, five years ago. They had a son who is now two years old. After Wang was appointed as Consul, Zhou followed him to the post. However, last year, due to disagreements, they signed a divorce agreement in English in Chicago on July 29, declaring their separation. At that time, Wang immediately complied with the agreement and gave Zhou $280 USD as travel expenses to return to China. Since then, they have gone their separate ways. After returning to China, Zhou resided at No. 31, Gongyi Lane, North Sichuan Road. Recently, Zhou expressed her intention to deny the validity of the divorce agreement. Wang then hired lawyer Wu Kaisheng to file a petition with the Mediation Office of the First Special District Court, seeking mediation to confirm the validity of the divorce agreement. The case was opened yesterday afternoon in the Eleventh Civil Court of the First Special Court. Zhou Jingwan also arrived in court with a lawyer. Zhou was wearing a dark-colored velvet cheongsam, a yellow wool short overcoat with purple and yellow trim, and dark yellow leather shoes. Her hair was permed, displaying the ultimate in fashion. When the trial opened, Zhou's lawyer stated that Wang and Zhou's marriage was during their student days. Later, Wang took office as the Consul in Chicago and had extensive social engagements. He then considered Zhou not to be his ideal wife, which led to disputes. One day, Zhou drank too much. Therefore, whether she signed the agreement is unknown. Moreover, Zhou has now moved to No. 24, Alley 468, Xiafei Road, so there are jurisdictional issues. However, lawyer Wu stated that Zhou did sign the agreement and that there were witnesses to prove it. The court then called Zhou to the case. Zhou stated that Wang Gongxing did not want to divorce her because his mother forced him to do so. Now, she expresses her unwillingness to divorce. Because Zhou was unwilling to divorce, the court ruled that the mediation was unsuccessful.

### Jinxin Silk Weaving Factory Labor Dispute Expected to Be Resolved

The Jinxin Silk Weaving Factory at No. 36, Longren Lane, Pingliang Road, Yangshupu, has been in operation for eight years. The factory employs more than 150 male and female workers. Normally, labor and management are quite harmonious. The wage rates set by the factory are generally better than those of other factories. At the beginning of the silk weaving industry labor unrest, the factory management informed the workers in advance that if other factories improved their treatment, the factory would follow suit. They asked the workers to work quietly. Unexpectedly, on the 16th of this month, all the workers of the factory suddenly went on strike spontaneously. At that time, the management immediately submitted a request for assistance to the municipal party and government agencies. The agencies immediately sent people to persuade them and issued a notice ordering the workers to resume work first and wait for mediation. However, the workers refused to accept this. As of yesterday, the factory issued a final notice, still strongly urging them to resume work immediately. All conditions can be resolved in the long term. It is reported that most of the workers deeply understand the factory's hardship and have expressed their intention to resume work immediately. The original text of the factory's notice is transcribed below: "Notice: This time, the workers demanded improved treatment. While the factory gathered representatives for negotiations, the workers declared a strike. The factory submitted a filing to the party and government agencies, and the party and government agencies ordered them to resume work first to prevent reactionary elements from inciting unrest. All workers in Shanghai complied with the government order and resumed work. However, the workers of this factory refused to comply. The party and government agencies, out of consideration for the ignorance of the workers, sent people to persuade them, but they ignored them. This kind of behavior clearly shows that there are bad elements inciting unrest, expanding the labor unrest, disrupting social order, and endangering business. For the sake of the livelihood of the majority of workers and social order, the factory has decided to resume work tomorrow (the 23rd) at 7:00 AM. All conditions are negotiable. If they are still misguided and willing to be used by bad elements, the factory, in addition to requesting the party and government agencies to take legal action, will take effective measures to avoid prolonging the labor unrest and to maintain social order. This notice is hereby given. Hope everyone pays attention to it."

### Bodhi Society Requests Protection of Temples, Pagodas, and Buddha Statues

The Shanghai Bodhi Society telegraphed the Military Commission yesterday, requesting that it order the national army to do everything possible to protect temples, pagodas, and Buddha statues. The original telegram stated: "To the Nanjing Military Commission, We believe that Buddhist philosophy is vast and profound, surpassing everything else. Even its images, religious objects, culture, and art have unparalleled value. Therefore, in recent years, European and American scholars have come to China to study Buddhism and investigate religious affairs in an endless stream. Seeing its precise instruments and rich scriptures, they deeply praised it as the glory of our country. Therefore, the temples, pagodas, images, paintings, books, and religious objects of Buddhism should be protected with all efforts, which goes without saying. Recently, it was seen in the newspaper that the army in the border area destroyed Buddha statues in a certain Lama temple. We believe that the people of Mongolia and Tibet mostly believe in Buddhism and value Buddha statues more than life. If they are destroyed, not only will the local people deeply hate it, but also worry that strong neighbors will use it as an excuse to incite unrest, turning the unreclaimed land into an ally of the enemy, and the surrounding areas may harbor rebellious intentions, which will be detrimental to military and political affairs. Although what is reported in the newspapers may not be entirely true, we must prevent it in advance. We intend to request your commission to order the national army that wherever they are stationed or pass through, they should do everything possible to protect temples, pagodas, Buddha statues, scriptures, religious objects, murals, inscriptions, and carvings, and not destroy them. This will greatly benefit the overall plan of the country and cultural arts, and it will not only be the fortune of Buddhism. We respectfully submit this telegram, and we respectfully ask you to examine and instruct us to comply. The President of the Bodhi Society, the Panchen Lama; Vice President, Shi Yinguang; Chairman, Wang Yiting; together bowed."

### The Thief Who Stole Electrical Wires Walks Right into the Trap

The day before yesterday afternoon at approximately 3 PM, a man named Xu Ajin, 29 years old, from Nanxiang, whose head, face, limbs, waist, and back were severely injured, arrived at the Xin Zha Police Station in Zhabei by rickshaw. He claimed that he had been brutally beaten by his enemies surnamed Liu and others near Xiaoyang Bridge on Jiaotong Road, and suffered severe injuries, especially to his face, which he said had been slashed with a sharp axe. However, examining the wounds, they did not appear to be axe wounds. Therefore, the police station immediately summoned Wu Songshan, a detective from the sixth squad of the Detective Team, to the station. Wu took Xu into custody for questioning, while also sending him to the nearby Pushan Hospital for treatment. Xu Ajin then confessed that he had been injured while stealing electrical wires, causing the wooden pole to fall on him. He claimed that in February of last year, he and accomplices, including Wang Amao from Ningbo, were caught stealing electrical wires in Xujiawan by the local defense corps and sent to the police station, then transferred to the Shanghai Local Court. Wang Amao was sentenced to one year and six months, and he (Xu Ajin) claimed to have been sentenced to six months, only being released on January 1st of this year. Since his release, he had stolen wires three times. The first time, he stole several bundles in Zhenru, selling them for $9.40. The second time, he sold them for $10.30, both times at the Deda Old Copper and Tin Shop at No. 30 Houma Road in Caojiadu. The third time was on the night of the 19th of this month, when he was cutting wires near the western end of Xiaoyang Bridge on Jiaotong Road. Just as he was cutting the fourth wire, a strong wind and heavy rain caused the wooden pole to fall, injuring his waist and back. His face was injured by the severed electrical wire. Because of the severity of his injuries, he could not go to the hospital for treatment, as hospitals require all injured people to be reported to the police. So he went to the police station and falsely claimed he had been beaten. Yesterday afternoon, the team sent leader Liu Bingyuan and detective Wu Songshan to No. 30 Houma Road in Caojiadu to summon Pan Wengao, the owner of the Deda Copper and Tin Shop, for questioning.

The incident was reported to the police station, and Cui Youkuan of the Pudong Detective Squad was dispatched to investigate and apprehend the robbers.

### Letter to the Editor

To the esteemed Editor of Shen Bao,

We respectfully write to you: We are extremely grateful for your newspaper's coverage of our association's celebration of the March 17th National Physicians' Day held at the Hu She. However, the item regarding the fundraising for the construction of the Central National Medical Hall is a mistaken rumor. The Capital National Hospital was initiated by Jiao Yitang, Director of the Central National Medical Hall, along with President Sun Zhesheng, President Yu Youren, and Vice-Chairman Feng Huanzhang, who deeply believe that the National Hospital meets the needs of the public and is still an innovation in our country. This matter is not only for improving the therapeutic skills of Chinese medicine but also for setting an example for all regions. Therefore, we intend to make the equipment as perfect as possible. In addition to President Sun Zhesheng and others submitting a proposal to the Central Political Conference to allocate 150,000 yuan for construction expenses, Director Jiao also transferred 30,000 yuan from the Central National Medical Hall's annual savings expenses to be used for the construction of the Capital National Hospital. The facts are as such. Director Jiao and others' move is to seek to promote the fundamental academic position of Chinese medicine throughout China, and everyone should have the obligation to contribute. The purpose of our association's celebration is to reflect this, so we are writing specifically to correct this and hope that it can be disclosed to show the true situation. We eagerly anticipate this and wish you all the best. Respectfully submitted, Secretariat of the Celebration of the March 17th National Physicians' Day by the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Community, March 22nd.

### Modern Politics and China (Continued)

— Jun Shan

The next point is to improve the efficiency of work. Because modern countries are in a state of constant struggle, they must be prepared quickly. If they are slow to prepare, they will be defeated, invaded, and oppressed. Therefore, all countries have to have very efficient work. To have such efficient work, the following must be in place:

First, require a responsible and dedicated government;

Second, require a planned and detailed government;

Third, require a technically proficient and skilled government;

Fourth, require an experienced and knowledgeable government;

Fifth, require a government that speeds up time.

These five points are indispensable for increasing efficiency. If one is missing, efficiency will decrease. Is there a way for multi-party politics to succeed in forming such a government? Decentralization, conferences, and unity are all impossible. Because if decisions are made by the majority, if discussions are held by the majority, and if there are checks and balances from the majority, how can anything be done well? On the surface, the parliamentary form of multi-party politics means that everyone is responsible. In reality, it means that no one is responsible. Therefore, today we should reverse the past and demand responsible politics, and eliminate parliamentary politics. In other words, the first thing is to take responsibility.

The second thing is to have a plan. In the past, when faced with a problem, opinions filled the room and no consensus could be reached. In meetings, you proposed something, and someone else opposed it. Someone else proposed something, and you did not agree. Perhaps the next day, they would agree with your opinion from yesterday, and you would oppose it. Originally, in theory, it is good to gather wisdom from many sources, but in reality, it is exactly the opposite. The more you discuss, the more confused you become. The more you discuss, the more disputes arise. It is hard not to feel that the Jin army has already crossed the river, yet the Song people are still debating.

### Cao Shuming's Speech on Soviet National Defense

Introducing the Key Points of Soviet National Defense for Our Country's National Defense Reference

To Further Consolidate China's National Defense, We Must Support and Obey the Leader

Yesterday morning (March 22nd), Fudan University in Jiangwan commemorated its weekly meeting, inviting legal expert Cao Shuming to speak on Soviet national defense in the university's auditorium. First, Vice President Wu Nanxuan of the university gave an introductory speech, followed by Cao's speech. Cao is skilled at lecturing. Having spent many years in Europe, he has a very deep understanding of the Soviet Union. He expressed the key points of Soviet national defense in extremely clear language, making them both profound and apparent. Not only is it a culmination of research on Soviet national defense, but it is also an important contribution for reference in our country's national defense. The key points are excerpted on the left for research and reference by those in our country who discuss national defense.

Cao first stated that modern national defense is not limited to military equipment. All the elements of nation-building have important implications for national defense. Today, he will discuss Soviet national defense from eight aspects: military (including industry and transportation), politics, diplomacy, law, finance, foreign trade, education, and society. First, military: Soviet military naturally ranks first in national defense. We should not only envy the greatness of the Soviet Red Army, but we should admire and pay attention to the special efforts of the Soviet authorities in heavy industry, especially the military industry. The two five-year plans laid the foundation for Soviet national defense. (To be continued)

### Woman from Sanlintang Accuses Police Chief of Dereliction of Duty

All Nine Officers of the Station Listed as Defendants; Further Investigation and Interrogation Pending Regarding the Details

Zhu Jinshi, a 39-year-old woman from the western market of Sanlintang, Shanghai County, Pudong, filed a complaint in the Criminal Court of the Local Court against Wang Jianhe, the chief of the local police station; Li Huanwen, the patrol officer; and police chiefs Wang and Chen, and officers Nos. 67, 69, and 123, accusing all nine officers of dereliction of duty, thus listing them as defendants. Yesterday, Judge Chen opened the court. Zhu Jinshi testified, "My husband Zhu Haishu's cousin, Jin Zhangshi, came to my house as a guest. Unexpectedly, at around 11 AM on March 9th, many police officers came to my house to arrest Jin Zhangshi and went into my room. At that time, I said, 'How can you police officers come into people's rooms? We haven't broken the law.' Then they threw aside the baby who Jin Zhangshi was breastfeeding, slapped Jin Zhangshi twice, and took her away. They also wanted to drag me away, but I refused. They tied me to a rickshaw and wouldn't even give me tea. Later, town head He Guiliang arrived and released me, so I am suing them." Defendant Wang Jianhe testified, "31 years old, from Sichuan, chief of the Sanlintang Police Station of the Shanghai County Police Bureau. Zhu Jinshi's statement is completely inconsistent with the facts. The incident was because Zhu Linbao, who runs a teahouse in the western head of Sanlintang, was gambling every day. He was arrested and punished for violating police regulations. It was found that Zhang Liansan directed the gambling in the teahouse, so I sent police officer Xia Baoyan to summon Zhang Liansan for questioning. However, Zhang's daughter, Jin Zhangshi, tore his uniform and destroyed the summons. Xia reported back to the station, and Patrol Officer Li sent police chiefs Wang Bingpei and Chen Fenghai and police officer Cao Ru to take Zhang and Jin Zhangshi into custody. While being taken to the station, they passed by Zhu Jinshi's door. Zhu Jinshi, along with more than ten women, shouted abuse and forcefully prevented our police officers from leaving. Zhang and Jin Zhangshi then ran into Zhu Jinshi's house. In order to exercise our authority, the police officers entered the house, and Zhu Jinshi shouted to many people to surround and beat the police. Police Chief Wang called Town Head He Guiliang to act as a notary public, and with He's agreement, only Jin Zhangshi was taken to the station, while Zhang Liansan escaped. Later, Zhu A'da and others came to the station and said that Jin Zhangshi had a child, so she was released on bail, but then she never appeared in court." The other defendants' testimonies were the same. The court ruled to postpone the hearing for investigation and further interrogation.

Spring and Autumn

### Strength

— (Shou Lun)

Because of the expansive power of gas, even the machines made of stubborn iron can operate flexibly. Because the haulers desperately pull forward, the fully loaded boat follows forward. Under the fierce blows of the hammer, the thick iron block is pressed into thin silk sheets. The reason why people can move lively under the heavy pressure of the thick atmosphere is because of the magnificent physical strength that surpasses the atmospheric pressure. …… Simply put, wherever the power reaches, all aspirations can be achieved. Archimedes, a famous scientist in ancient times, once said a famous bold statement: "Give me a place to stand, and I will move the earth." That is exactly what it means.

Therefore, we dare to boldly say: "Wherever 'power can reach,' can make 'the universe change color.'"

Not only is the phenomenon of the material world like this, but everything in the spiritual world is also like this. When the power of a country stretches into the territory of another country, the color of the map will change.

Therefore, we might as well not live in the world. If we intend to live in this world, regardless of what we are dealing with, everyone must cultivate higher and greater strength.

### Eccentricities of Several Great Men

— Meng Qiao

A quirk is a strange hobby, and it can be said that everyone has one. Eccentricity is the strangest of strange hobbies. For example, this publication once recorded that someone specifically likes to collect traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions, etc. From the perspective of a third party, someone with a quirk must have a mental illness. At the very least, his mind must be abnormal. Recently, reading biographies of world celebrities, I discovered that almost all great men have quirks. I really don't understand whether one must have an abnormal mind to become a great man, or whether the mind must become abnormal after becoming a great man. Now, I am excerpting a few laughable quirks: The French literary giant E. Zola liked to count the number of gas lamps on the streets of Paris in his spare time from writing. The number of gas lamps on each street was recorded in detail in his diary.

The British writer S. Johnson liked to count the railings on the street. When he passed a large building, he would use his cane to count each railing. He believed that if he counted wrong, he would start counting again without fear of trouble.

The German poet F. Von Schiller had to step barefoot on a piece of ice whenever he wrote poetry, all year round.

When the French politician G. de Narvel took a walk after dinner, he often led a live giant shrimp. He tapped the shrimp's body with a beautiful silk rope, letting it jump around, and he slowly followed behind. When passersby gathered around to watch, he would say: "This giant shrimp is my pug dog. How quiet and honest it is? People can walk dogs on the street, of course I can walk a giant shrimp!"

### Child Poet Zhou Tianjian

— Wei Fang

The young poet Zhou Tianjian is from Hukou and is 14 years old this year. When he was three years old, he moved to Jiujiang to avoid the war, and met an unknown fortune teller who said that he had a very good talent and would definitely achieve great things in the future. Because his lively and exquisite face at that time fully showed his intelligence.

His father was a scholar and had also been an official. He liked him very much and often taught him to read. In addition, he had a talent, so it is no wonder that he had amazing achievements.

At the age of five, he was very interested in poetry. He could recite and explain ancient Tang and Song poems and could even write one or two himself. When his father saw this, he was amazed by his talent and would often give him pointers. Therefore, he did nothing all day except recite poetry. However, his calligraphy and painting were also very impressive.

One day, his father told him about the deeds of Wen Tianxiang and Shi Kefa. He listened intently with his eyes wide open. At the end, he said generously: "We must imitate people like this. Originally, a person's death is heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather. We must not rot silently like grass and trees……"

He also said with a smile: "I will be a poet of the nation." Later, he worked hard to study. In less than a few years, he had considerable achievements, and of course it was easy to make progress. His poems and writings were outstanding, and for a time his fame spread throughout the area. Whenever literary figures and scholars held banquets, they would invite the young poet to participate. If there were any questions during the banquet, he could answer them fluently, and his poems were quick, skillful, and excellent, and everyone regarded him as a child prodigy. Once, Dai Jitao, the President of the Examination Yuan, passed through Jiujiang and summoned him for an interview, which made President Dai praise him endlessly.

Now, he has accumulated more than 200 poems, called Lai Yuan Yin Cao, whose words are fresh, elegant, magnificent, and heroic, which is truly rare. We believe that after a few more years, this young national poet will definitely become famous throughout the country.

### Ding Dong Hawkers

— Ying Dai

"Ding dong…………Ding dong…………" In our lane, we can hear the sound of "ding dong" several times a day, except on rainy days.

Because we hear this sound every day, it seems that we are used to it. Therefore, even the children held in our arms, as long as they hear the sound of "ding dong," will say without hesitation that the ding dong hawker has come. At that time, if you push open the door, you will see a person pushing a ding dong cart with wheels in one hand and skillfully shaking a ding dong drum in the other. Inside the wooden frame are a gong and a drum. As long as you shake your hand, the gong and the drum will sound at the same time.

One after another, ding dong carts are pushed into the lane every day, "Ding dong…………Ding dong…………" The sound seems a little annoying, especially at our windows. The people pushing the ding dong carts also "ding dong" and shake the drum. Sometimes the children fall asleep and are awakened by the sound, which is really unspeakable annoying. However, no matter how much I hate them, the ding dong carts are still being pushed in constantly, and there is nothing I can do about it.

A ding dong cart can be said to be a mobile small department store, because on this ding dong cart, all kinds of Chinese and foreign goods and household items are sold. It can be said that although the sparrow is small, it has all the vital organs. Especially the cosmetics, needles and threads used by women, as well as the toys loved by children, fill it, and even various candies are sold. However, the goods on the cart are not fixed and will change with the seasons. For example, in winter, health shirts, woolen socks, woolen yarn, and honey are displayed. In summer, they are replaced with a batch of undershirts, sweatpants, fans, fly swatters, and other things. Like in the lunar New Year, there are the most toys and firecrackers.

When the ding dong cart comes in, in addition to the children rushing to surround it, the maids and servants will also hurry out to buy some things, because they are working non-stop every day and can't spare time to go outside to buy them. Even housewives who lack some odd sundries, want convenience, and have someone deliver them to their door, saving them from running out, so they buy them on the ding dong cart. Therefore, a ding dong cart will sell some things. The prices of things bought on the ding dong cart are not very expensive, about the same as outside, but most of the goods are substandard. It is impossible to buy good things, especially × goods, which have been particularly numerous recently.

I accidentally talked to a person who carries a ding dong cart and learned that although the capital of the ding dong cart is different due to the size of the cart and the number of goods, a better cart also costs more than 100 yuan to make. And if there is sufficient goods, at least 300 to 500 yuan. It can be seen that although it is a small business, the capital is not small. In the past few years, when the market was better, they could do more than ten yuan of business every day, but in recent years, due to the decline of the entire city, they have also been seriously affected, and the average is only five or six yuan of business every day.

Illustration News: The famous painter Gan Xiaomo is skilled in landscapes, excels in poetry, is gentle and elegant in nature, values friendships, and has worked hard on his creations. His works remotely inherit the Tang and Song dynasties. He won an award at the Chicago Expo two years ago. His selected works, such as Rich Spring Willow, Spring Outing Horses, are clear, beautiful, quiet, and tranquil, with wonderful ink. Last year, he visited famous scenic spots in the Southeast and learned from nature. After returning from his travels, his settings have become even more amazing. He has now revised his drawing guidelines for the sixth time to support the poor.

### A Plum Blossom Viewing Trip to Prince Temple, Haiyan

— (Xiahu)

The plum blossoms in Chaoshan stretch for dozens of miles and are famous for their ancient Tang and Song plum trees. However, few know that the plum blossoms in Prince Temple, Haiyan, also stretch for several miles and also have ancient Tang and Song plum trees. However, because of its location on the coast and inconvenient transportation, it has not yet been able to achieve the same fame as Chaoshan plums. The fortune and misfortune of plum blossoms is like this. However, most things in the world are like this, and it's not just plum blossoms.

The temple is located outside the north gate of the county town and enshrines the statue of Han Emperor Fu Taiwei, mistakenly known as Prince, hence the name Prince Temple. The temple is dilapidated and already shows signs of decay. Usually, there are neither tourists nor incense, but when the plum blossoms are in full bloom, a few local women from the city wander in this fragrant snowy plum blossom forest. A few days ago, I and Cheng Xuemen hired a car to view the plum blossoms. Leaving the north gate, the homes on both sides were all in the middle of the plum blossoms, until we reached Prince Temple. The avenue from the north gate to Prince Temple was built after County Magistrate Zhang Shaowu came to Yantian. It is said that when County Magistrate Zhang was in Yantian, he was not greedy for money. A civil official who is not greedy for money is a good official. I came to Shanghai yesterday and visited Mr. Li Gongyu of the Xinfeng Silk Factory, who said that the plum blossoms in the plum garden near Liuying Road are in full bloom, and there are also many old branches that are graceful and lovely. Due to busy affairs, I don't know if I can fulfill this wish to find plum blossoms.

Biographical Notes

### A World's Youngest Military Officer

— Ordinary

Félix Saralegui, born in February 1919 in Argacha, Spain. He grew up in poverty and labor. At the age of fourteen, he became a bricklayer. He sympathized with the Socialist Youth League, so he joined it; at the same time, he joined the General Workers' Alliance as a member. After three years of trade union life, he became a conscious revolutionary soldier. When the fascist rebellion broke out, he immediately rushed to the militia of Argacha and went to the front. In July and August of last year, he fought in the mountains and was promoted to squad leader. Later, due to his heroic leadership, he was elected as an adjutant.

Amidst the hail of bullets in Toledo, he bravely carried the elderly women who were wounded and lying on the streets to safety. The commander paid tribute to him, but he humbly refused, saying, "This is just fulfilling my duty."

On the Madrid front, two hundred militiamen occupied a house in the line of fire. Suddenly, the enemy attacked, and Félix's soldiers abandoned the line.

"Why are you running away?" he shouted, "We must take it back immediately!"

He shouted loudly to the fleeing soldiers.

Only twenty comrades followed him, but that was enough. They used grenades and rifle volleys to recapture the house. Before Saralegui and his companions' resolute defense, more enemies, including Moors, were defeated and fell, and others fled.

Because that position was very important, the headquarters once again congratulated him. He received the honorary title of officer. He is now seventeen years old.

"Why did you join the militia?" a reporter once asked him.

"This is my inevitable duty," he replied briefly, and then added, "Because we, the young masses, want to live freely, so we must drive out the fascist executioners at any time. This war is a duel for the right to a happier life for the masses of the people. We will definitely win!"

A few days ago, a detachment of the Farmers' Youth League held a meeting. A political commissar said to them: "You will be commanded by Officer Saralegui, do you agree?"

Everyone cheered in agreement. Now Félix Saralegui, the world's youngest military officer, leads the artillery battalion of the People's Army composed of young people, each of whom understands the goals and significance of the struggle very clearly.

### The Mandarin Ducks That Changed Nests

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Chapter 12 (White paper, red stationery, only two lines of tears remain, reeds and maple leaves, walking alone through half a city in autumn)

Guoqi said: Naturally, the man communicates with the woman first; there's no need to ask. Xiaosong said: What did you write in the first letter? Guoqi said: Of course, it's very polite. In fact, even now, the letters are still very polite. Xiaosong looked directly at his face and said: Didn't you say these are characters from a novel? How can you say they are still being polite now? Surely you know everything about this relationship between these two people. When Guoqi said the words "even now," he originally wanted to swallow them back, but once the words left his mouth, there was no way to erase them. He immediately started thinking about how to turn the conversation around. When Xiaosong asked him, he first smiled silently. Xiaosong said: Brother, you are truly an honest person; you've let the cat out of the bag. Whether it's castles in the air, based on a real person, or even based on you, I don't need to ask. I only have one suggestion. In your poems, it's as if there's someone actually there, about to emerge from the page. Such a good woman is admirable because she is so full of poetic flavor. But a woman like Lin Daiyu is no longer suitable for the times. You must write about her overcoming adverse circumstances and becoming a brand-new couple with this man. That's what I mean if you're writing a novel. If there is such a person, we should lend a helping hand to let them gain freedom. Don't just be sentimental, standing alone in the west wind before the setting sun. Guoqi said: That's hard to write. If it ends with a grand reunion, it will inevitably fall into a cliché. Xiaosong put the poem on the table. At some point, the maid had placed a cup of tea on the table. He picked up the cup, slowly took a sip, and smiled slightly: You always write about sorrow in your novels, which isn't good. At the very least, you should write about a pair of secondary characters whose marriage is very fulfilling. Guoqi laughed: I can't find such a secondary character. Let me write about you. However, the only characters you appreciate are from the Banhqiao Miscellany. I am very unfamiliar with that path. (148)

Business News

### Securities and Public Bonds Rise Sharply and Plummet

The morning market wildly surges, with Type D jumping over two yuan. In the afternoon, selling pressure returns, and the drop is also extremely severe. Trading is extremely prosperous, with only three trades made throughout the day.

Yesterday, the market situation at the Chinese Securities Exchange was extremely lively. The multi-party had already inclined to sell, because the price increase in recent days was too high, and many bulls took profits. Although there were occasional strong pull-ups, they had become the end of their rope, so the decline in the afternoon suddenly rose, but the trend has not yet reached the point of collapse. Today is the last day of this month, and the market situation may have drastic changes. Although the strength of this foreign multi-party company is said to be strong, it is not as good as the total number of spot goods, which is not something that ordinary people can monopolize. After yesterday's opening, the multi-party seemed to have fresh troops. The pull-up was extremely fierce. Nos. 5, 6.34, 45, and 47 were bought one after another, but Nos. 4, 10, 11, 35, 72, and 77 were sold. The sellers took the opportunity to raise prices, and the market price rose another 5.5 to 1.05 yuan, climbing up step by step, seemingly without end, reaching 96.10 to 11 yuan. The second round of frantic pull-ups increased Type D by as much as 1.3 yuan this month. For a time, many short-sellers painfully cut their losses. Nos. 18, 34, 45, and 50 bravely bought in, while Nos. 4, 5, 11, 43, and 58 were also extremely enthusiastic to sell, so the market gradually became weak. Type A still fell by 5 to 10 cents, and 96 also returned slightly by 40 cents. The afternoon opening was late, and it was changed to one trade. The financial community sold a lot, and the market price uniformly returned slightly, but most of the multi-party was still watching, so it fought back slightly by 3-40 cents to 1.1 yuan. Yesterday's market price results still rose by several tens of cents to 1.9 yuan, but Type A futures only rose by 5 cents. The total turnover was 18,055,000 yuan. Now, the results of the rise and fall are listed on the left for comparison (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).

### Yarn and Flower Coarse Yarn Sales Suddenly Boom, Cotton Yarn Market Atmosphere Rebounds

The rumor of increased consolidated tax is extremely prevalent. About 5,000 bales of new yarn are released.

The yarn market continues to rise, and the atmosphere is calm. The actual reason is that yarn sales are still picking up, coarse yarn business in North China is smooth and healthy, and at the same time, the overseas yarn and flower market situation has rebounded, so people's hearts are becoming more and more invigorated. This month, the multi-party is preparing to receive goods. The market rumor of increasing the consolidated tax is extremely prevalent, so the futures market is even more bullish.

Standard yarn rises again by 1.67 yuan. At the opening of the standard yarn market in the morning, each month showed an upward trend. The overseas flower and yarn market situation has rebounded, and at the same time, the spot yarn sales market is lively. The business in North China is even more prosperous. However, most of the purchases are coarse yarn. This month, a certain merchant is preparing to receive goods, and the factory has released about 5,000 bales of new yarn. As a result, each month of standard yarn rose by 80 cents to 1.24 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day. The market situation was still flat at the afternoon opening, because although Bian Shao had the intention to receive goods, on the one hand, he came out of the cage when the price rose, so the market was flat. Unexpectedly, the board opened and the table was slightly relaxed. Suddenly, it fell until the third closing. It was heard that 4,000 bales of yarn were sold and transacted, and Osaka Sanpin yarn surged by 5.5 to 9.8 yuan. People's hearts were revived, and the near month jumped wildly by 90 cents to 1 yuan. As a result, each month rose again by 1.3 yuan compared with the morning closing price. It was found that Dafeng sold 1,900 bales, Jinchang 1,200 bales, Zhenda 2,150 bales, Yuan Yi 1,100 bales, Changfeng 5,600 bales, Hengchang 1,650 bales, Tonghe 2,700 bales, Yongda 1,200 bales, and Xiesheng 1,000 bales. Mingde bought 5,950 bales, Daqing 1,150 bales, Minghua 1,851 bales, Shen Ji 2,000 bales, Renfeng 2,250 bales, Dachangcheng 2,450 bales, Tonghe 2,050 bales, and Xincheng 2,800 bales. The highest and lowest prices in one day are listed on the left.

Yarn sales still have more than 4,000 bales. Spot yarn sales are lively. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 4,658 bales throughout the day, and the selling price rose by 1.2 yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below.

### American Cotton Decline Slightly Stabilizes, Cotton Rises Quite Rapidly

The cotton market rebounded because the decline in American cotton has been curbed. The rise in Osaka Sanpin flower is particularly strong. In addition, the yarn market is rising, and people's hearts are even more tense, but some colleagues have turned from long to short. This month's delivery of 16-count raw cotton is sufficient, so the pressure is still heavy, but the original cotton of 24-count and above is becoming more and more agile.

Standard flower rises by 4-50 cents. At the opening of the standard flower market in the morning, each month rose uniformly, because the decline in American cotton has been curbed and rebounded by 2 to 9 pounds. Osaka Sanpin flower rose by 1.12 yuan, but the decline in Indian cotton was severe. However, the yarn sales have improved, and there is deep fear that the factory will purchase raw materials, and people's hearts are rising. As a result, each month of standard flower rose by 30-35 cents compared with the closing price of the previous day. The market situation was still firm and rising at the afternoon opening, but the multi-party massively released files, and the second round suddenly fell until the third closing.

### 24,000 Bales of Spot Yarn Traded in One Week

The market price has risen by 4-5 yuan.

Since one week, the actual sales of cotton yarn have improved. Various gangs have begun to purchase due to the development of spring sales. The Sichuan gang first purchased, and the Tianjin gang also followed. The purchase of the Yunnan and Guangdong gangs is also not thin. The inland gangs' import volume is even greater, and other gangs are also purchasing. According to market rumors, most people say that since April 1, there is fear that the consolidated tax on cotton yarn will increase, and various gangs are especially anxious to load spot goods, so yarn sales are becoming more and more lively. At the same time, the world's three major cotton markets are all moving forward, so people's hearts are shaken, and market prices are rising step by step. The rise in standard yarn is particularly strong, and the near and far futures have directly crossed the 240 yuan mark to 245 yuan. It was found that the actual yarn purchased by various gangs (from March 15 to 20) totaled 24,561 bales, an increase of 16,174 bales compared with the 8,387 bales traded in the previous week. The selling price has risen by 4-5 yuan. The transaction amount of each gang is listed on the left (unit: bale).

### Long-staple Indian Cotton Has Hope of Rising

The cotton market has been active throughout the past week. After the price of American cotton rose, there were more inquiries about exports. Japanese merchants not only purchased to offset old amounts, but also had new transactions. Lancashire purchased Karachi flowers, and the mainland gangs bought relatively cheap black leaf Aomu Yuan spot flowers. Long-staple flowers will have the hope of rising. The statistics for the past week are attached below (unit: 1,000 bales).

### Piece Goods, the Weather is Mild, Cloth Sales are Booming

Japanese factories' selling prices are becoming more and more firm.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market, due to the re-emergence of the overseas cloth market, various customer gangs were also gradually active due to the mild weather. The Sichuan gang, which had not moved for a long time, slightly entered 2-300 pieces of serge tribute and various grades of blue cloth and colored twill. Wholesale shops and dyeing factories in this street entered more than 1,000 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill, causing Japanese merchants' market prices to become more and more firm. Fine cloth is shouting 2.5 to 5 cents higher per piece, and spot fine twill is particularly bullish, shouting 7.5 cents higher (per piece) than at the end of the tenth week. Hongfu Baoxing, the 16-pound coarse cloth from this factory, also rose by 5 cents per piece. The market price of Yihua factory's coarse cloth is unchanged, but Jin Santa's bleached cloth has raised 10 cents. Wholesale in inland areas along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines is still endless. The retail business in this street is also gradually prospering, so spring and summer goods such as satin, printed cloth, chloroth cloth, and various grades of plain silk, although the market has not increased, are more firm than last week.

### There is a Great Lack of Plain Goods and Woolen Fabrics

The local customer gangs' large and small Western clothing stores all have a strong appetite for plain woolen fabrics priced at 5-6 yuan per yard, but because there is a great lack of goods in the market, the price of goods has risen quite firmly as a result. The arrival of Western goods in Shanghai is limited, and although Eastern goods have been transported, the number is also small. Among the domestic goods, only Wuxi Xiexin Factory still has products, but it is also not enough to meet the demand, so recently, shops and brokers with a little capital are mostly searching for them. This spring, foreign firms have mostly shipped mohair fabrics such as Hum's four-volume durable cloth and Halifax, but plain goods are rarely seen.

### Food, Xinghua New Wheat Arrives in Shanghai

Selling opens at 6.05 yuan. Futures trading is still not smooth.

Yesterday, in the association market, hundreds of bags of new wheat from that place and Hua, shipped by the Fujian gang, were of very good quality, with large particles, clean body and purple skin. This kind of goods is actually produced in the area along the Shanghai-Ningbo Road. It was soon purchased by Shenda for more than 70 bags at a price of 6.05 yuan. It is said that new wheat in that place usually needs to be around the Qingming Festival in the year, but now it is one month earlier, which is a rare event, and it is even rarer to ship to Shanghai for sale.

After the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, the market in each month showed a firm and then flat appearance. Because the price of foreign wheat was reported to have risen by 7-80 cents to 1.1 yuan, people's hearts were stable when the price was opened. The price of this month opened at 20 cents and 8 minutes. Trading below April was not smooth, and the market lacked vitality. When the market opened in the afternoon, because this month was not far from the suspension of trading, the customer gangs' collection volume had decreased, and the factories in this port were very懈怠, so people's hearts were not soft, and the closing price was as low as 6.24 yuan. Trading in April was not smooth, and the market also stopped. Below June, because customers' sales were not smooth, some non-professionals absorbed them, so they were better by 3-5 cents. The spot wheat market is still stable, with Kaijiangbei wheat at 6.32 yuan, followed by 20 cents, Huangqiao wheat at 6.3 yuan, followed by 20 cents, and Liuhe wheat at 6.22 yuan, followed by 20 cents. A total of about 3,000 bags were opened.

### This Month's Futures Flour Rises and Falls Very Quickly

Yesterday, the flour market, the market in each month, showed a uniform and stable appearance. The price of foreign wheat was quoted, and Chicago rebounded by 7-90 cents, Canada near rose by 1.1 yuan, and far rose by 8-90 cents. Liverpool had ups and downs with each other. After the price was opened, the people's hearts in this month were not good at first. The opening price was only 83 cents, and then the customer gangs had a slight appetite, and the floating shorts took the opportunity to quickly cover their positions. The closers of the bulls were silent, so the people's hearts were prosperous, and the closing price was as high as 88 cents and 25 cents, an increase of 50 cents and 1 cent compared with the initial opening. Below April, due to the recent rebound, the people's hearts were also charming, an increase of about 20 cents compared with the previous week. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was rumored that the inland factories in this month had 5-630 bags prepared for delivery, so people's hearts became weak again, and the lowest fell by 40 cents and 25 cents. The trading volume below April also fell by 10 cents. Then, because the short covering was still smooth, it rebounded slightly. It was found that there were only two days of trading after this month. If customer sales were flat, it could pass smoothly.

### Futures Beans Fall and Then Return

Oil Cake Rises and Falls Differently

Yesterday, the standard soybean cake market rose and fell differently. After the opening of the morning market of standard beans, due to the sluggish actual sales in recent days, the arrivals were endless, and the bulls urgently sought to close their positions. The opening price in the morning once fell slightly by 4-50 cents to 70 cents. In the afternoon, the market rebounded slightly, and the spot goods of the car beans were readily purchased by the factory, and the market gradually recovered. At the afternoon closing, each of March and May was slightly down by 10 cents, and April was unchanged. Standard oil, due to the sluggish futures market and sluggish digestion, the firms continued to sell, the entrants watched, and the price returned slightly by 1-20 cents. Standard cake digestion gradually became strong, and the market also saw a report. Yesterday, the market was still flat in the morning, and then there were customer stocks asking about the price, and the market gradually built up by 2-30 cents.

### River Rice Still Oversupplies

(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs were more surging than before, with a total of more than 90 ships arriving, totaling 18,450 stones. Among them, there were still more than 50 ships of thin rice, while the sales market was even more sluggish in this street. Although the Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and Henan gangs continued to purchase 3-4,000 bags of thin rice, they still felt that the supply exceeded demand, and the customers' eating habits were still harsh, making it more difficult to support the market price. As a result, the market prices of thick and thin japonica rice continued to fall by 1.5-10 cents. Judging from the overall situation, there seems to be a downward trend in the past two days, so if there is a shortage of sources, there may be a hope of stabilizing. Du Yangjian lacked goods, and the negative yuan fell slightly by several cents, following the trend of the japonica rice market by a foot.

(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the number of ships coming from various places in Hexia was quite strong, about 50 ships. The transactions in the market were very懈怠, and the market was high and white japonica rice was flat and tired, and the secondary one was slightly 1-20 cents. Early rice followed slightly by nearly 10 cents. The price of thin rice fell slightly by about 10 cents. The price of Yangdu indica rice fell by 6-70 cents, and the price of port customer pointed rice fell by 3-50 cents. The negative conversion yuan price was fixed, and the remaining goods all showed a downward trend.

### Customer Indica Rice Sales Stalled

Machine Brown Rice Falls by More than 10 Cents

Yesterday, the arrivals of customer indica rice were still strong, but the Guangdong gangs' appetite had stalled, and it was rumored that six batches of foreign rice ordered by Guangdong Province had arrived in port, and the need for customer indica rice in the future may be stalled, and even if it is embellished, the number is limited. Therefore, the market price in the market is extremely virtual, and the transaction volume has also decreased sharply. The total transaction volume throughout the day was only more than 3,000 bags. The Northern Gang purchased 220 bags of Xiang rice, and Xi'an purchased more than 100 bags of Gan yuan. The rest was only the entertainment of this street, so the machine rice fell sharply by 15-60 cents. Brown rice had less inventory, and it also fell slightly by about 10 cents. The total transactions throughout the day were 2,783 bags of Gan rice, 220 bags of Xiang rice, 80 bags of Wenzhou indica rice, and 350 bags of Wan indica rice.

### Medical Science Should Actively Promote Scientific Training

— Chen Zhiqian

(Reprinted from the 21st issue of the third volume of the "Folk Bi-Monthly")

At the Third Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee, Committee Member Jiao Yitang and others proposed to instruct the Ministry of Education to formulate regulations for the teaching of Chinese medicine and incorporate them into the educational system. Committee Member Li Zonghuang and others requested the implementation of the original proposal for equal treatment of Chinese and Western medicine from the Fifth National Congress. In today's era of national crisis and the need to revive all sectors, such proposals are not very important and have no value in being raised. However, from the perspective of medical science itself, there are a few points for Committee Members Jiao and Li to consider.

China today adopts Western engineering technology to build Western-style houses favored by great men and to construct highways and railways that connect cultures. We have never heard of China needing to preserve the skills of old-style carpenters and bricklayers to counter modern engineering. At the same time, everyone today hopes that the government will adopt the organization and equipment of foreign armies. We have never heard of anyone advocating the preservation of China's old-style soldier training and weapons to consolidate national defense. Only when Chinese people borrow science as the foundation for developing medicine does it cause a violent reaction in society and a meaningless dispute between Chinese and Western medicine, which is truly ridiculous! The motives of Committee Members Jiao and Li are nothing more than:

1. Some patients are treated ineffectively with Western methods, but then achieve good results with Chinese medicine. Thus, people say that Chinese and Western medicine have value in coexisting.

According to this argument, one should recognize that the strength of "Western medicine" lies in the application of scientific observation and experimental methods to study the relationship of physiological changes, not just the techniques of treating diseases. If "Chinese medicine" recognizes the value of science, understands scientific methods, and then fully utilizes scientific observation and experimental methods to study the content of "Chinese medicine" and investigate the results of "Chinese medicine" treatments, we would certainly welcome it. Unfortunately, most Chinese medicine practitioners do not understand scientific methods and content. Relying on "Chinese medicine" to study "Chinese medicine" theories is absolutely impossible. If there are one or two people who are proficient in the basic sciences of Western medicine and engage in "Chinese medicine" research, the result will be "Western medicine" researching "Chinese medicine," absolutely not "Chinese medicine" researching "Chinese medicine"!

At the same time, without a scientific foundation, one cannot prove the claim of "effective" or "ineffective." Individual cases are certainly worth noting, but without scientific methods of identification, personal experience is never academic or universal in natural science. If Chinese medicine practitioners or those who admire Chinese medicine all stick to individual cases and ignore the application of modern scientific methods, I have nothing to say, and Chinese medicine will never become a universally recognized academic discipline! Even in the places where scientific medicine originated (European and American countries), there are still many people who believe in folk remedies and secret prescriptions. However, these folk remedies and secret prescriptions cannot be publicly recognized as "effective" or "ineffective" before being organized using scientific methods. Those who are ignorant and unskilled may never understand this point!

2. In recent years, hygiene administrative personnel have all received Western medical training and have not studied the techniques of Chinese medicine. The failure of those who study Western medicine to research the content of Chinese medicine is a shortcoming in today's Chinese academic community. Indeed, medical colleges should have specialized personnel to organize the quintessence of the nation's several thousand years using scientific methods. However, this task is extraordinarily heavy. Given the current situation of lacking both people and resources, it is often impossible for "Western medicine" to research "Chinese medicine," not because it is unwilling or inappropriate. Since research is impossible and truth cannot be obtained, the result is that the "Chinese medicine" curriculum is set aside and the scientifically based "Western medicine" is used as the foundation for teaching. This is why Western medicine does not understand Chinese medicine. The fact that hygiene administrative personnel have not studied the techniques of Chinese medicine is not because they are unwilling to learn, but because those who run medical schools do not know how to use the unvalidated content of Chinese medicine to train hygiene administrative personnel. Moreover, hygiene administration includes disciplines such as vital statistics, infectious disease management, and sanitation engineering, which cannot be found in "Chinese medicine." If Chinese medicine is used to preside over hygiene administration, wouldn't that be another joke!

3. The promotion of Western medicine hinders the interests of merchants of "pills, powders, plasters, and elixirs," so the issue of livelihoods becomes the focus of the conflict between Chinese and Western medicine.

China's industry is backward, its manufacturing power is weak, and its large-scale adoption of imported goods in the application of science is detrimental to the national economy. This is the harm of promoting Western medicine. The solution is to ㊀ encourage the improvement of basic industries and ㊁ continue to promote the use of necessary imported goods. If Chinese people do not use imported airplanes and cannons, they will never think of manufacturing airplanes and cannons themselves. To have Chinese people manufacture "Western medicine" themselves, it is also necessary to use imported goods to develop the market. This kind of immediate loss is unavoidable!

As for the old "pills, powders, plasters, and elixirs," if they are proven to have universal efficacy, they will not only be sold domestically in the future but can also be transformed into imported goods in various countries in the East and West. If they are proven ineffective, a portion will naturally be gradually eliminated and will not be spared simply because of the proposals of the Central Committee members. One must know that enlightened people today do not oppose the sale of "pills, powders, plasters, and elixirs," but doubt the basis of such medicines. Central Committee members should encourage this doubt and promote the motivation to use scientific research to study "Chinese medicine." How can one sacrifice the permanent academic foundation of the nation for the temporary change in the livelihoods of a few people? This is too short-sighted, and such a method of protecting "pills, powders, plasters, and elixirs" will only lead to their demise!

Besides these, there are of course conflicts of emotions between the authorities, deliberate difficulties, and other private issues that cannot be addressed. I only hope that Committee Members Jiao and Li will propose ㊀ abolishing the terms "Chinese" and "Western" medicine and uniformly calling them national medicine. ㊁ The Ministry of Health should establish a National Medicine Research Institute, gathering famous Chinese and Western doctors in the capital to conduct medical research. ㊂ Prepare to add the results of the research to the curriculum of medical colleges.

It is a big joke for a country to have two schools with different basic training for one academic discipline and profession, and it is also ridiculous to have two personnel with disparate abilities (hygiene administration) receiving equal treatment! As long as the Ministry of Education uses scientific training as the basis for medical science, no matter whether the sign says Chinese Medicine Specialty School or Medical College, the results obtained will be the same sooner or later. The young people who originally studied "Chinese medicine" will all take the path of "Western medicine" to create China's national medicine!

### Improved Eating Habits

— Song Guobin

The ancients said it well: "Take the good from others to make up for your own shortcomings," and also said: "Choose the good and follow it." The meaning of this sentence, to extend it, is that if we do not learn from the strengths of others and stubbornly stick to our old ways, that is called stubbornness. But if we blindly follow others without asking whether they are good or bad, that is close to blind obedience. The stubborn are not clever, and the blindly obedient are not wise. Their foolishness is the same, and their losses are equal.

Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four essential things in life. In today's Chinese cities, clothing, housing, and transportation seem to have been largely Westernized. Only in terms of diet do most people still adhere to the old Chinese ways.

Eating seems to be the most important of the four things! The way Chinese and foreigners eat can be said to be completely different. Is the Chinese way right? Or is the foreign way right? I think each has its advantages and disadvantages. There are two conditions for eating: first, it must be hygienic, and second, it must be economical. Foreign countries have a separate eating system, with each person eating their own portion. No matter how many people are at the table, the risk of transmitting diseases through food is unlikely to occur. This way of eating is, of course, hygienic. But the word "economical" cannot be mentioned. China has a shared eating system, with several dishes placed on a table for seven or eight people to eat with. It is extremely economical! But what about hygiene? It is too far removed from the separate eating system! Several pairs of chopsticks are used to pick at the same dish, and several spoons are used to stir in the same bowl of soup. As long as there is a patient with an infectious disease, there is always a risk of infecting those who eat together. Even if there is no infectious disease, the saliva and tartar are enough for people to share! At the same time, when Chinese people eat, they put their mouths to the bowl, lower their heads, and bend their backs. Most Chinese people in their forties and fifties are hunchbacked. The reason for this is probably due to studying at desks and eating at tables. Some people even suck in food with their mouths. When they suck, the glottis is wide open, and food can enter the trachea along with the breath, causing choking. Food scraps and saliva are sprayed all over the table, and some of them are inevitably sprayed into the public dishes and soups. Even if it is not infectious, it is inevitable that others will find it annoying. There is also the point that holding a bowl in one hand and chopsticks in the other causes the left hand to ache somewhat before the meal is finished. All of these are unhygienic and inconvenient aspects of the Chinese way of eating that are not found in the foreign way of eating.

From the above, it can be seen that the foreign way of eating is hygienic but not economical, while the Chinese way of eating is economical but not hygienic. This is what is meant by each having its advantages and disadvantages. Many people want to improve the Chinese eating system and advocate completely imitating the foreign system of separate eating, but in China's economic situation, it is not easy for families below the middle class to fully implement separate eating, because it is too uneconomical. In order to solve the economic problem and not violate hygienic conditions, some people advocate that each person use two pairs of chopsticks, one for taking food and one for eating. But if one is not careful, the chopsticks for eating may enter the food bowl, and the chopsticks for taking food may be put into the mouth, which is still useless. Since both of the above methods are difficult to apply, I will now introduce to the public the method that has been practiced in my family for several years.

This method is very simple. In addition to a rice bowl, each person has a spoon and chopsticks. The chopsticks are specifically for taking food, and the spoon is specifically for eating. In addition, two or three public spoons are placed for each person to take soup with. Whenever one wants to drink soup, one first puts the public spoon into the private spoon (the spoon for eating) and then puts it into the mouth. When eating, one also uses chopsticks to take food and put it into the spoon. The benefits of this way of eating are: first, it avoids infection; second, it does not cause hunchbacks and choking, because one does not need to put one's mouth to the food or suck in air. Third, the spoon and chopsticks are separate and easy to remember, so there is no confusion. Fourth, one does not need to hold the bowl in one's hand, which avoids hand aches. The problems of the Chinese way of eating can be said to be eliminated in one fell swoop, while the advantages of the Chinese way of eating - economy - are absolutely preserved. This method can be said to have the name of shared eating but the reality of separate eating, the benefits of separate eating, and the advantages of shared eating at the same time. The drawbacks of both separate and shared eating are swept away. People who are interested in improving the Chinese eating problem, why not try it?

There are many foreign habits that are worth imitating. But we must absorb their essence and not rigidly adhere to their format. This is called taking the good from others to make up for our own shortcomings, and this is called choosing the good and following it.

### Prospects for Medical Education in Our Country in the Future (Part 1)

— Chang Shih-ying

The introduction of modern medicine to China has a history of exactly 101 years. In the first 75 years of these 100 years, medical education and undertakings in China were entirely managed by private individuals, most of which were run by Western missionaries. During these years, they faithfully promoted their work and undertakings, so they eventually established the foundation of modern medicine in China, which we all recognize and greatly admire. In fact, even now, medical schools and hospitals under the auspices of Western missionaries and with foreign funding still occupy a very important position in China.

## Page 14

Fortunately, the Chinese government has now assumed responsibility for the management and planning of medical education throughout the country. There are currently three types of medical education institutions in the country, as follows:

㊀ Government-established, or jointly established with the government, and provincial and municipal public institutions: 1. Peking University Medical School, 2. National Central University Medical School, 3. National Tongji University Medical Department, 4. National Sun Yat-sen University Medical Department, 5. Zhejiang Public Medical and Pharmaceutical Specialty School, 6. Hebei University Medical Department, 7. Northeastern University Medical Department, 8. Taiyuan Medical Specialty School, 9. Nanchang Medical Specialty School, 10. Hubei Sun Yat-sen University Medical Department, 11. Peking Army Medical School.

㊁ Privately established by Chinese citizens: 1. Nantong University Medical Department, 2. Tongde Medical Specialty School, 3. Nanyang Medical University, 4. Southeast Medical School, 5. Fengtian Medical Specialty School, 6. Xiamen University Medical Department, 7. Women's Medical Specialty School.

㊂ Established by foreign churches or private individuals: 1. Peking Union Medical College, 2. Kwong Jih Medical Specialty School, 3. South Manchuria Medical University, 4. Hsiang-Ya Medical College, 5. Guanghua Medical Specialty School.

In addition, there are domestic organizations researching new medicine, such as: 1. The Medical and Pharmaceutical Society of the Republic of China, 2. The Chinese Medical Association, 3. The Medical Missionary Association of China, 4. The Sino-German Medical Association.

The above passage briefly describes the progress of medical education in our country today. However, it is still in its infancy and very immature. We, the people in the medical field, must pay close attention to future developments. This is just a foundation, and to achieve future development, we must eliminate all the following errors and follow all the following regulations.

A. Eliminating Sectarian Ideas

Today (our country's medical schools only have a single-level system, which makes it easy to achieve unification. Even if a two-level system of medical schools is produced in the future, it is hoped that the level of each level can be equal. Why is this? The major problem with medical education in our country today is that the courses taught in various medical schools across the country are uneven. Not only that, but the language used to teach medical education in each school is also inconsistent. Some use English and Japanese, and some use French and German. Is medical education also regarded as an imported commodity to be sold for profit? This is a difference of a hair's breadth that can lead to a mistake of a thousand miles. New medicine is a public academic discipline of the world and is by no means unique to any one country. If we introduce this public academic discipline of the world to China, we should teach it in Chinese language and writing. If we still use foreign languages, it is easy to give people the misunderstanding that the knowledge of medicine taught in a certain country's language is called the medicine of that country. Therefore, if we want to reorganize medical education in China, we should first correct the error of using foreign languages in teaching and use Chinese for teaching to unify it. This is the first and most important point. Second, the system and curriculum of medical education in China should be systematically and organizedly compiled so that all schools across the country, whether single-level or two-level, should tend to be uniform, without the disadvantages of being uneven. If the Chinese people can earnestly carry out these two points, the future of medical education in China can be optimistic. Otherwise, it is like a blind man riding a blind horse, approaching a deep pond at night. How can they not fall? Moreover, the most unfavorable phenomenon in our country's medical field today is the establishment of various factions. Unfortunately, the division of factions is now obvious. This is truly a misfortune in China, where medicine is still very immature. Compared with the major powers, today's Chinese medicine is even worse than a maidservant imitating a lady. How can we be arrogant and claim to be factions? If factions arise, they will inevitably deceive each other, be jealous, exclude each other, and be mutually incompatible. How can we expect unity and seek progress together? This is truly a cause for a long sigh for the future of medicine in our country. I believe that we, who study new medicine, should be humble, learn from each other, and explore each other. In this way, we can gain insights and make inventions. Today, however, we are deeply poisoned by factionalism, and the spirit of cooperation is becoming increasingly fragmented, leading to complete incompatibility. It is truly heartbreaking to say this. It is hoped that those who engage in medicine in our country in the future should strive for thorough understanding and focus on research when learning. After completing their studies, they should be able to translate and introduce their knowledge in their native language. It is like food, which can only be nutritious if it can be digested. Otherwise, if one learns from a certain country and can only publish in that country's language and cannot replace it with Chinese language, then one is said to be eating old food without digesting it. What is the difference? Thinking of this, I feel that we should translate all kinds of single words and terms used in medicine so that they are exceptionally clear. Not only should we create a dictionary, but we should also gather the words of five or six countries to form a Chinese-Western comparison table. This is truly an exceptionally important plan. For example, one side uses all Chinese characters, and the other side uses Latin as the main body, with English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and other languages as guests. In this way, we can avoid the problem of Chinese people publishing medical matters in foreign languages. As for wanting to eliminate the factions between schools and teaching doctors, we should come up with other strategies. I have repeatedly discussed this method with several comrades, and they all expressed sympathy with my proposal. What is my proposal? It is to set up a medical research institute and hire medical doctors who have returned from studying in Europe, America, and Japan. All those who study medicine and have expertise, regardless of which country they studied in, should be required to have special expertise in their field and be willing to continue research and pursue further study. All such people should be invited to join the institute. The minimum period of research in the institute should be two or three years. Talents who have returned from studying medicine in various countries should gather together, each using their strengths to encourage each other. In this way, in a few years, they will not only understand each other's learning but also be able to make progress. There may also be new inventions. Moreover, having been together for a long time, they will also be able to understand each other's character and behavior, and the gaps will be eliminated. Thus, they will unconsciously forget which country they learned from, and the concept of factions will also disappear. Not only that, but on the one hand, they can engage in research, and on the other hand, they can plan for future teaching and practice from time to time. Therefore, this medical research institute is no less than a teachers' college for medical education, which can cultivate sound medical teachers for the whole country. If this plan is implemented, all medical professors in the country will come from this institute. After more than ten years, medical education in the whole country will truly be unified. Therefore, the establishment of this kind of medical research institute is truly the most urgent task and the source of fundamental treatment. At the same time, the organization of a pharmaceutical research institute should also be promoted in tandem. This is a thorough method for reorganizing medical education in the whole country.

B. Various Medical Schools

1. National Tongji University Medical School

Tongji University Medical School was founded by the German Bao Long. It was not nationalized until after the European War. The school is located in Wusong. The various departments of the school's medical school are listed below:

㊀ Anatomy Hall

㊁ Physiology Research Hall

㊂ Biology Hall — Animal Hall

㊃ Chemistry Research Hall

㊄ Pathology Research Hall

㊅ Pharmacology Research Hall

㊆ Bacteriology Research Hall

㊇ Public Health Lectures

9 Clinical Departments

Each hall and department is well-equipped and has research work, making it one of the most complete medical schools in the country. The students of the hospital have clinical practice in Shanghai Bao Long Hospital. It is now planned to assign the Shanghai Municipal Hospital to the college as a place for practice.

The school's entire annual funding is 700,000 yuan, with the medical school accounting for more than 200,000 yuan. Among them, there are more than 200,000 yuan for the engineering school, and the remaining more than 200,000 yuan is for the school's affiliated senior high school and senior vocational school. The professors of the medical school are all German, and Chinese are only associate professors.

The school has a special precision machinery repair shop. The person in charge of the repair duties is also German and comes from the German Leit factory. All precision instruments, such as microscopes, can be repaired. This person is jointly invited by the school and the Shanghai German Merchant Yanghang. The salary is 300 yuan per month, with the school and the Yanghang sharing half each. The equipment for this instrument repair is truly a pioneering initiative in the medical field of our country.

### Medicinal Plants of Domestic Production (Continued)

— Zhou Mengbai

(101) Persimmon Diospyros Kaki, L.F.

(Plant) A plant belonging to the Ebenaceae family, it grows wild in the mountains and is also often planted. It is a deciduous tree. The leaves are alternate, short-stemmed, smooth on the surface, obovate or broadly elliptical, entire, and have an acuminate apex. Monoecious. During the plum rain season, axillary unisexual flowers emerge. Male flowers are cymes, small, and generally three in number. Female flowers are solitary and large. The berry is spherical or oblate, and turns red when ripe.

(Crude Drug) Persimmon calyx Calyx Kaki is collected as the calyx attached to the fruit and dried. The woodware is light green or brownish-yellow, split into four lobes. The lobes are ovate and reach 15-20 mm in length. The inner surface has short hairs. The taste is pronounced and astringent.

(Ingredients) Persimmon calyx contains a nitrogen-free crystalline substance with a melting point of 2750°C.

The pulp contains about 14% invert sugar, 0.3% free acid (mainly malic acid), tannins, and oxidizing enzymes.

The endosperm of the seeds contains a large amount of Maunan

The white powder on the surface of dried persimmons is mannitol.

Persimmon astringent juice contains a tannin-like substance called Shiboul (empirical formula C14H20O9).

Regarding the removal of astringency from persimmons, astringent persimmons are usually placed in barrels of residual alcohol or immersed in warm water at 30-40°C for twelve hours. This method is nothing more than using the oxidizing enzymes in the cells to cause the tannins accumulated in the cell gaps to take effect, causing the cells to die. As a result, the tannins are oxidized and become a tasteless substance. The Japanese Sawamura once proved this method by experiment. He cut an astringent persimmon in half, and after treating one half with chloroform vapor, causing it to take effect, he analyzed it and found that it contained 15.91% sugar and no tannins. The other half, which had not been treated with chloroform, contained 16.18% sugar and 8.23% tannins. Therefore, in the removal of astringency from persimmons, the sugar content hardly increases or decreases, but because of the disappearance of tannins, it feels even sweeter.

(Medicinal Use) Old sayings: Persimmon calyx is effective in treating persistent hiccups. The dosage for one time is 8 grams, used as a decoction.

Prescription example: Persimmon Calyx Decoction, effective for treating hiccups.

Persimmon calyx 8.0 cloves 8.0 ginger 3.0

Decoct the above in 100 and take immediately.

Dried persimmon (persimmon cake) or persimmon frost (the white powder on the surface of persimmon cake) has a cough-suppressing effect.

### Smuggling Copper Coins for Export

— Ying Chun

Japanese and Korean people smuggling in North China has become an open secret, and this activity has spread to the north and south of China in less than half a year. From the perspective of our national sovereignty, this is undoubtedly illegal. However, so far, our authorities have not only failed to take effective preventive measures but have instead allowed it to intensify! At first, it was done secretly, but later they dared to openly rob and attack customs officers. Needless to say, this is very distressing. However, this kind of thing only appeared in areas where the central authority was weak, but now even in Shanghai, which is under public scrutiny, this kind of violent drama is being staged.

According to a report on the 21st, the day before yesterday, after 12 o'clock at night, more than a hundred Japanese and Korean vagrants who were smuggling copper coins gathered in the "Japan House," a Japanese inn opposite the Huishan Wharf in Tilanqiao. Each person wore specially made clothes with huge pockets all over, filled with copper coins, about five thousand coins each, totaling about seventeen or eighteen thousand yuan. They boarded the 'Shanghai Maru' successively from the Huishan Wharf. Vagrants were stationed along the way, heavily guarded. At about 3 o'clock yesterday morning, when the last batch of vagrants fully loaded with copper coins were boarding the ship, they were discovered by customs officers, who immediately went forward to search. Unexpectedly, the vagrants took out pre-prepared iron rulers and other weapons and attacked the customs officers, resulting in seven Chinese and Western customs officers being seriously injured, one of whom had his hand bone broken. The Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai was informed and immediately sent staff to the ship to rescue the customs officers. Seeing that the matter had been exposed, they had to order the vagrants to hand over about two or three thousand yuan in copper coins, which were loaded into two trucks and transported to the customs as a way to shirk responsibility. The remaining more than ten thousand yuan was still loaded onto the "Shanghai Maru" and shipped out.

Another source added that the vagrants have been smuggling copper coins for export for a long time. Dishonest merchants in the Wusong Road and Gongguan Road areas of this city have been buying them on behalf of the Japanese. Each time Japan exports, they load large quantities of copper coins. This secret was only revealed yesterday morning. A month ago, the price of copper coins in this city soared due to excessive purchases by the Japanese. Fortunately, the Central Bank exchanged a large number of one-cent copper auxiliary coins, which gradually stabilized the situation. However, certain parties are still recklessly smuggling them as usual. What was seized yesterday was only a small part of it.

Judging from the above facts, it is natural to imagine that the smuggling of copper coins by the Japanese and Koreans is organized and planned. Otherwise, our customs officers would not have suffered the misfortune of having their bones broken. At the same time, the Japanese's barbarity, arrogance, and contempt for our national sovereignty can also be imagined. We don't need to worry about whether they are smuggling copper coins for the purpose of manufacturing artillery shells, but at this moment, when Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is being loudly promoted, repeated attempts to disrupt our country's finances make it impossible to believe their sincerity. This incident of copper coin exports leading to the beating of customs officers, I think, can probably be regarded as a head-on blow to those who are fascinated by Sino-Japanese cooperation, making everyone wake up, right?

### North Star

— Luo Yu

A lonely, hazy sky outside the window, the black fingers of night adorned with a few golden stars in the corner. The wind has stopped blowing, but in the desolate and melancholy space, the stars shine brightly in a painted canvas.

These few stars, linked together, seem to be playing a game of catching geese far away. Such a game was my favorite pastime in childhood, and now I remember it again, and I see it again. I lie in my bed, peering out from under the covers. It is very cold outside.

I have moved here for three days. The first time I saw these stars from my bed, my soul almost laughed aloud, I almost cried. As I peer from under the covers, through the dim air of this room, over the black horizontal line of the rooftops opposite, I cannot be sure how far I have traveled, yet they are playing my childhood's old game of catching geese.

Once it was late at night. The alley was completely silent, it should have been the time for nightingales to visit, but this place was only filled with cunning dreams, and I never even heard the lovely bird sounds, but the stars? They shone brighter, dazzling.

I have become familiar with their positions; I cannot say their names. Those names are hidden in the hearts of astronomers, both solemn and beautiful. How interesting it would be to ask an astronomer! How amazing! But I cannot know, and can only gaze deeply, deeply and unblinkingly. The cold air flowing in through the cracks hisses at my eyes. My eyes are very tired. They become stiff, turned into flint, turned into golden arrows, unable to move for a second, unable to close for a second. These are no longer my eyes, they are two companions of the stars.

I see those stars quietly moving and shifting in the lonely canvas-like sky. Their games, sent over after who knows how many ages, are ancient, even more ancient than our ancient ancestors; progressing slowly. The night grows deeper. They move to the lower left corner of the canvas.

I had a dream: in the summer night's courtyard, my lonely, loving mother was fanning away the mosquitoes for me. I lay flat on a long bench, listening to the sound of the shadow puppet show from outside the village carrying over the silent flowers and leaves, my eyes glancing at the constellations of the northern sky.

"Mom, what are those stars called?" I asked curiously, "Those stars in a string."

"That's the Big Dipper," my mother said in a calm voice.

"And over there?" I asked greedily, "Those three by that white cloud?"

"Not white clouds," my mother said in a loving voice, "That's the Milky Way; that's the Cowherd; on this side of the river is the Weaver Girl; and there's also Taurus."

The night silently crept over the earth. The stars were lonely and remote. The sound of the shadow puppet show from outside the village stretched into the late hours, and the stars quietly moved and shifted. I saw a star, and I asked my mother in surprise, "That bright, big star, why doesn't it move?"

"That bright, big star," my mother said in a kind voice, "That's the North Star, it never moves."

Suddenly, countless dazzling lights and bewilderment leaped before my eyes, the stars circled the heavens, rapidly spinning, they spun around that big, never-moving star, creating sparks, pulling into golden threads.

I sang the praises of the joy in the dream.

### The Story of the Will-o'-the-Wisp

— Liu Ying

Long ago, Liu Town had only three families, living a scattered life of farming. Outer Mountain Village was a mass burial ground, so will-o'-the-wisps often appeared.

Outer Mountain Village is a high slope, filled with graves, some still with nameless tombstones - perhaps because the years were long, the words were worn away by wind and rain. Below the slope is a small river, the water is emerald green, always seeming to carry a bit of civility.

### Morning

— Shen Bing

The white, misty morning fog blew into my house; a window had been pushed open by the wind last night. The warm air lingering between the thick quilts gradually dissipated, and my head, exposed outside the quilt, couldn't help but shrink back in my dream. I had such an insignificant dream: it felt so easy, in one night, I reached out and shook down the golden stars all over the sky. But when I woke up, all I could find on last night's pillow was a pile of cold tear stains.

I closed the window. The white mist lost its exchange with the slow air indoors. The water mist on the window glass condensed into droplets and trickled down, washing into two transparent gaps like distant expanses. Outside the window, the sky was filled with dancing mist.

The distant sea waves splashed onto the rocks and dragged white foam back, only the wind tip in the memory, even the huge roof could not penetrate the dense fog layer. A uniform haze was soaking everything from far to near.

The mist and dew soaked through the shoes of pedestrians, and countless small water droplets condensed on their upturned short hair. Each in a silent figure walked out from the corners of the houses, walking alone and disappearing into the smoke-like fog layer. Occasional vehicles rolled across the road, not the car carrying people, but people pulling the car. The back of the person pulling the car was slightly hunched.

The steaming white vapor pouring out of the tofu shop diffused into the narrow street corner. A small dog on the threshold curled up, as if resting by a warm stove. The door of the house across the street opened suddenly, and a hand stretched out from inside the door and poured something into the center of the street, then gently closed it again.

The small dog on the threshold scurried over with its short legs, and ran in a puff of smoke. The dog sniffed around the pile of discarded medicine dregs in the road, stretched out its two front legs to grasp it, as if grasping the cold chest of the gravel road.

Smoke from the chimney on the roof of that house was already swirling with coal smoke.

Outside the dense circle of fog, the sun stretched out a bit of red tongue, licking the uniform sky, the thick fog collapsed like snow in the sun. A gust of wind swept across the sky, and the fog thinned. Gauzy skirts, subtly bright, swayed in the wind before the window.

The whistle of a distant train pierced the sky, which was frozen cold by the fog. Unseen iron wheels rolled on two shining parallel rails, spraying panting coal smoke. It was suspected to be carrying the light of morning from afar.

Good morning!

## Page 16

Seeming to flow endlessly, the water surface had ripples, and at the same time, the sound of murmuring trickles could be heard.

The three families in Liu Town were the descendants of ancestors who had carried their belongings from distant Shanxi, seemingly during the reign of some Great Qing emperor. They had no expectations and settled in the barren land, diligently cultivating every day. In winter, they also went into the mountains in groups to cut firewood. They did not feel lonely, nor did they feel monotonous, even though it was only a family of more than ten people.

One bleak autumn night, silence filled the surroundings of Liu Town. They returned from cutting firewood in the mountains. On the way, Da Shunzi was singing a folk song. Suddenly, the weather turned gloomy, and the autumn insects stopped chirping. All of them remembered the ghost stories told by the old people, and the more they thought about it, the more afraid they became. Liu Shunzi also stopped singing. Everyone felt the same fear and terror in their hearts, and even their footsteps seemed to become a little labored.

Liu Shunzi: When was it? Xiao Wogezi felt he couldn't remain silent and seemed to want to embolden himself by speaking. However, his voice couldn't help but tremble.

"Soon, there's only half a li to the bottom of the mountain." Liu Shunzi was more experienced, but he was just as terrified. They continued their journey while talking.

"Ah, where did that light come from?" The person in front, upon discovering the light, immediately put down his bundle of firewood and stopped moving forward.

The light got closer and closer. They lost their composure and with a shout, ran eastward, each minding his own business,

In the morning, a group of people found Xiao Wogezi's body in the graveyard. Soon, several others died one after another. Afterwards, only Liu Shunzi remained to tell people the story of the will-o'-the-wisp.

The population gradually became denser, and batches of people moved in from outside. When going to the mountains to collect firewood, they never dared to wait until late at night to return. They filled a load and sat in front of the Shidi Temple to eat steamed buns, listening to Liu Shunzi tell the story of the will-o'-the-wisp.

One day, Liu Cheng got drunk on the white liquor he had brought with him on the mountain. When he returned, he fell behind others and fell asleep alone on the hillside outside the pass. But no one dared to visit him, all thinking back to the story of the will-o'-the-wisp harming people. They thought Liu Cheng was surely suffocated to death with blood flowing from his nostrils and his face turning black.

The next day, Liu Cheng did not die, but had slept soundly all night. When he told the story of last night, the courtyard was crowded with people, all craning their necks.

"I was drunk as mud. All around me were lights, but I had not done anything bad, so I could be very peaceful..."

He was very energetic and very happy. When he said that he had not done anything bad, he seemed particularly energetic.

The population became denser. Everyone took Liu Cheng as an example. When they were preparing to go out at night, they first examined whether they had done anything bad, and they also tried their best to drink enough old liquor. It was said that liquor could suppress the will-o'-the-wisp. Relying on his own experience, Liu Cheng moved to the outside of the mountain pass, which is now the very prosperous Shanzhuang.

The will-o'-the-wisp never harmed people again. Moreover, it completely disappeared. Only old people told the story to children like a fairy tale when they basked in the sun.

The beauty of Xiaoxiang's concubine is unparalleled. Listening, the parrot recites poetry to the point of heartbreak. The golden wind blows down the autumn tung leaves. Her slender and delicate body feels the evening cool. She stops embroidering. She covers the gauze window, and bathes in the orchid room, managing her remaining makeup. Lightly applies snail-shaped ink for spring mountain green. Lightly dyes rouge with orchid musk fragrance. Jade carvings slantingly comb into a greasy cloud bun. Red silk pants reveal snowy skin and fragrance. She stands quietly on the jade steps without a word. She lightly shakes a round fan facing the setting sun. The golden crow gradually disappears into the western mountains. The moon rises and shines on the flowers and silver walls. She turns and tosses, pitying her delicate shadow. She softly calls Snow Goose to light the silver lamp. Purple Cockscomb, asks the mistress. Why do you always sigh and weep? Her heart is full of unspeakable things. For whom does she become thin and lose her beauty? Helplessly, the water clock drips on. She removes her wide silk clothes and gets on the ivory bed. She only hears the rain hitting the plantain and wetting the crabapple.

The lady of a great family is polite, happy and smiling. She is rare to know the rituals and poetry, sewing and weaving with joy. She does not dye modern new patterns, nor does she follow the frivolous customs of learning to be clever. She manages the family affairs in an orderly manner, regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter. Assisting her husband, she is worthy of being a female hero. She teaches the children by the red lamp at night. Deep in her orchid boudoir, she works diligently. She does not recognize the west and east roads when she goes out. Frugal and thrifty in managing the family is a great virtue, plain clothes and simple meals give a happy heart. She accompanies her young sister-in-law in reciting a poem, pondering the poetic lines in the painted building. She accompanies her husband in a game of chess, her slender fingers are exquisite. She serves her husband's parents with joy and attends to their meals, her seasonings tasting like the work of heaven. On a sunny window, she casually writes a picture, the brush is full of ink, revealing a brilliant flower. Her husband's parents are all happy. Happiness can be complete, which is not easy. The high hall celebrates her birthday, reporting more sons. She smiles towards her husband, when will she hold them to see her father-in-law? A kind of tenderness is truly delicate, after all, the rural etiquette is admirable. She does not know modern infatuated women, two modern children are cages, and does not envy modern easy appearance.

A Sister Piece Surpassing the Cherry Orchard's Inspector General

After the Bright Light Theater Group prepared to participate in the Spring Joint Performance, it decided on two plays; only this year was it confirmed that both were Russian comedies, one was Gogol's "The Wedding," known as the "Father of Russian Literature," and the other was Chekhov's "The Proposal," known as the "King of Short Stories"; "The Proposal" is Chekhov's one-act play, translated by Cao Jinghua, included in the drama collection "The Boor" in the Unnamed Society series. "The Proposal" is a rare comedy in Chekhov's works, completely based on his unique novel style, it can be said to be a novelistic drama, filled with his so-called tearful smile. Anyone who has read Chekhov's novels will probably acknowledge this. In "The Proposal," Chekhov's humor is even more developed.

"The Wedding" is Gogol's work following "The Inspector General," translated by Geng Jizhi, serialized in "Translation." Although this play and "The Inspector General" are in the same mood, after carefully reading it, the fun is different. We can see ease everywhere in this play, and it is not like "The Inspector General" which makes people laugh wildly, but the effect of the comedy surpasses all other dramas.

Now putting "The Proposal" and "The Wedding" together should be an interesting process, but the time these two plays were produced is exactly the opposite. "The Wedding" reflects the ugliness of the Russian officialdom in the 1840s; "The Proposal" reflects the various human sentiments of the ninth-rank official's estate in the 18th century. Although both are important events in life, a comparison will definitely reveal the different attitudes of Gogol and Chekhov in observing society. What is most satisfying is that the translations of the two plays are not only directly translated from the original text but are also translated by Geng Jizhi and Cao Jinghua, who are very knowledgeable about the Russian language. So, the text is not only faithful but also very beautiful. We believe that when the audience watches the plays, in addition to understanding the advantages of the two original authors' work intentions, they will also feel the advantages of the two translators' translations.

The Forties Theater Society Changes Its Style

This time the Forties Theater Society participated in the joint performance. The Society adopted "The Sacred Flame" written by the modern British playwright S. Maugham. The plot is extremely confusing and tortuous. When the curtain opens, it can arouse the audience's interest. Following that, as if falling into five miles of clouds, there is a general tendency to not leave the seat until the end of the scene. According to this drama, it has been performed more than a thousand times in New York and London, and has also won a lot of praise in Paris. This is the first time the Forties Theater Society has performed a foreign drama.

"Sacred Sacrifice" Renamed "Life, Death, and Love"

The Forties Performance Committee passed a resolution to hire Mr. Sun Shiyi as the director of this play. After Mr. Sun nodded in agreement, he immediately stepped up his work, and revised it in ten days, and renamed it "Life, Death, and Love," because there are unique insights into the three major problems of this life in the play. The current version of Mr. Sun has been revised will make the Chinese audience feel the greatest satisfaction.

Sun Shiyi talks about performance methods

Someone asked Mr. Sun Shiyi about the performance plan and methods of this play. Mr. Sun said, "At present, it has been decided to adopt a realistic performance method. It is best to arrange the language, movements, and expressions item by item during rehearsals." In recent days, all the actors have been stepping up rehearsals, and the final general rehearsal will be held in the coming days.

The New System of Two Groups Performing in Rotation

The whole play is divided into three acts, and nine people are required to perform. The Forties Theater Department decided to have eighteen people perform this play, divided into two groups, that is, two people are responsible for one role. When rehearsing, all eighteen people are required to attend. According to the theater department, this method is not preparatory in nature. The main thing is to give the members more opportunities to act in plays, and to be able to exert different acting skills and styles under the same director's plan. As for who will play which role, it will be fully disclosed by the Joint Propaganda Committee of the theater groups in the coming days.

Li Shengyun is Busy Reading Foreign Magazines

This time, the person in charge of costumes for the Forties performance has been changed to Ms. Li Shengyun. The lady has been busy consulting foreign magazines and running to Western clothing stores in recent days. According to her, the plot of "Life, Death, and Love" takes place in the four or five years after the European War. The evening dresses and casual clothes for men and women must be made according to the styles of that time.

The Setting of "Life, Death, and Love"

The setting of "Life, Death, and Love" has been discussed as early as half a month ago. It is now the responsibility of Mr. Zhao Ming, and Mr. Zhang Yunqiao, Xu Xingzhi, Wu Yaqing, and other gentlemen have been invited as consultants. It is heard that the setting has been generally decided and is quite gorgeous.

The Joint Publicity Committee of the Theater Groups is Established

The joint performance of various theater groups is aimed at the necessity of having the preparatory committee unify the publicity work. The Joint Publicity Committee was established, organized by one representative from each of the five theater groups, and is responsible for all publicity matters this time.
