The reasons for Sun's riot are partly due to communist agitation and partly because Zhang Xueliang had more than a hundred trusted soldiers who were very well treated, each receiving a monthly salary of sixty yuan.

Now, these negotiations have been declared broken, that is, the Social Mass Party has clearly expressed its rejection of the People's Front movement. (According to recent reports in the Tokyo Metropolitan News, Yomiuri Shimbun, and other magazines.)

The Labor Council initiated this merger movement. The purpose of the merger was to form a united anti-fascist proletarian front movement. Responsible for bringing together the Social Mass Party and the Labor Council were the two leaders of the National Levelers League and the National Farmers Union: Jiichiro Matsumoto and Hisao Kuroda. The merger negotiations lasted for four months.

Firmly opposed to this merger were the Secretary-General of the Social Mass Party, Hisashi Aso, and Komakichi Matsuoka, Chairman of the All-Japan Labor Federation, which supports the Social Mass Party (Metropolitan News). The reasons for the opposition were: ㊀ Non-recognition of the Labor Council as a merger target; ㊁ Differences in political views between the Social Mass Party and Kanjuro Kato (hereafter referred to as Kato), the leader of the Labor Council (Yomiuri Shimbun.)

The breakdown of negotiations is recognized by all parties. What happens after the breakdown? There are two different accounts: Firstly, among the lower-level members of both camps (Social Mass Party and Labor Council), the atmosphere for a merger is already strong, so Matsumoto and Kuroda have jointly requested the leader of the Social Mass Party, Isoo Abe, to reopen negotiations (Metropolitan News); Secondly, the Labor Council believes that the breakdown of negotiations is an opportunity to organize a new political party, and has already begun a vigorous movement, preparing to lobby the whole country in mid-January and hold a national congress for the formation of a new political party in February (Yomiuri Shimbun - January 8th)! Although these two accounts differ, they agree on the point that the Labor Council will not give up the People's Front movement.

㊁ Examination of the Reasons for the Breakdown

The so-called "non-recognition of the Labor Council as a merger target," as explained by the Social Mass Party, means: "Upon joining the party, one must join the affiliated branch in an individual capacity." The Labor Council is a group, not an individual, so it is not recognized as a merger target. The so-called "difference in political views with Kato" means: Kato believes that the objective situation in present-day Japan already has the various conditions for the formation of a People's Front. The Social Mass Party, however, denies the existence of these conditions, and at the same time denies the future of the People's Front.

The Labor Council was formed in the fall of last year. Kato is unwilling to join the Social Mass Party in an individual capacity, only willing to join in a group capacity, which is very clear. Kato's reasons are: First, in order to "stimulate the activism of the anti-fascist faction within the Social Mass Party and break the illusion of the fascist faction within the Social Mass Party," it is necessary to establish a force outside the Social Mass Party to criticize it. Uniting this critical force is also absolutely necessary in promoting the merger movement. To make the Social Mass Party truly become the central force of the People's Front, it can only be realized by first uniting the forces outside the Social Mass Party into a group, and then joining with this group. Second, even before the merger negotiations are successful, there should be an organized and continuous anti-fascist movement. — This is the reason for organizing the Labor Council ("A Road to the People's Front" — written by Kato, published in Chuo Koron, September issue.)

However, Kato's reasons, in the eyes of the Social Mass Party, especially the Aso faction, are exactly the opposite.

Kato said: "Break the illusion of the fascist faction within the Social Mass Party." This in reality is to break the illusion of Hisashi Aso's faction. Hisashi Aso's relationship with the military and his relatively large influence within the Social Mass Party are well-known facts. Before Kato can divide the Aso faction, while shouting about breaking Hisashi Aso's illusion, he also demands to join the Social Mass Party, which is of course rejected by Hisashi Aso, the Secretary-General of the Social Mass Party.

Hisashi Aso and Kato joined the labor movement at the same time (1917). Before 1932, Hisashi Aso and Kato often belonged to the same organization, and in terms of organizational status, Hisashi Aso was above Kato. After the formation of the Social Mass Party in 1932, Kato regarded the Social Mass Party as a fascist organization, and they became increasingly opposed. In the 1936 election, although both of them received more than 50,000 votes, Kato received the most votes among all the congressmen. There is no doubt that Hisashi Aso is increasingly jealous of Kato. When the tide of the People's Front reached Japan, Kato seized the slogan of the People's Front to appeal, and demanded that the Social Mass Party accept the program of the People's Front, Hisashi Aso was of course even more worried about his own leadership position being shaken. However, this is clearly a kind of sectarianism and exclusionism.

In addition to the contradiction between the two individuals—two social forces—becoming the cause of the breakdown, we can also point out several different basic views of the Social Mass Party and the Labor Council regarding the People's Front.

㊀ "Today, those conditions (conditions for forming the People's Front) do not yet exist..." This is what Hisashi Aso said at the roundtable discussion "People's Front or National Front?" — Japanese Review, September issue) ㊁ The current government—military—financial capitalists' suppression of the People's Front movement was long imagined by the Aso faction, so they said: "Forming the People's Front will instead stimulate the government, giving the government an excuse to suppress the labor movement." The Social Mass Party does not dare to develop the labor movement through struggle, but only attempts to develop it in a peaceful attitude of comfort, which is very clear.

In addition, the Social Mass Party is still dreaming of parliamentary struggle. This dream is indeed very sweet now. The result of last year's general election showed a major leap forward for the proletarian faction. In particular, the number of congressmen from the Social Mass Party increased to eighteen, while all other proletarian factions outside the Social Mass Party only gained six seats in total. The Social Mass Party is dreaming of future parliamentary advances, and is very afraid that the People's Front will wake up its beautiful dream.

Calling out socialism, holding on to a portion of the working masses with its left hand, but finding it inconvenient to reject the powerful fascists with its right hand, is the Social Mass Party of today.

Shouting the People's Front, but holding too few of the working masses in its hand, is the Labor Council of today.

Only the working masses themselves can merge the Social Mass Party and the Labor Council.

㊂ Encourage the Relationship Between the Working Masses and the Social Mass Party and the Labor Council

In 1935 (labor statistics for 1936 have not yet been seen), the total number of workers in Japan was 5,906,589. The total number of organized workers was 408,662. That is, organized workers only account for 6.9% of the total number of workers (according to a survey by the Social Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs.) This is enough to show that the organizational power of Japanese workers has not yet been fully developed.

However, these 400,000+ organized workers are not completely united under one or two political parties. There are 993 labor organizations. Among them, only a portion support the Social Mass Party and the Labor Council.

The labor organizations that support the Social Mass Party include: the General Federation of Government Workers Unions, the Japanese Seamen's Union, the All-Japan Federation of Labor Unions, the Seafarers Association, the General Federation of Japanese Farmers Unions, the Japan Harbor Workers Union, the Tokyo Electric Power Employees Union, the Japan Iron & Steel Employees Union, the Japan Pottery Workers Union Federation, and the Tokyo Gas Workers Union, etc. Those who support the Labor Council include: the National Council of Japanese Labor Unions, the National Farmers Union, the North Japan Farmers Union, the Tokyo Municipal Employees Union, and the Tokyo Transportation Labor Federation, etc.

Among these labor organizations, there are those who support both the Social Mass Party and the Labor Council, such as the National Farmers Union and the Tokyo Municipal Employees Union. In short, among the above-mentioned groups, those who express support for the Social Mass Party account for about eight-tenths. Those who support the Labor Council account for about two-tenths.

In addition, there are quite a few labor organizations with fascist characteristics, such as: the Loyalty and Filial Piety Labor Union, the New Japan Seamen's Union, the Tokyo Electric Power Patriotic League, and the Greater Japan Labor Union Council, etc.

If the Social Mass Party can conduct a united front with the Labor Council, and then actively engage in the unorganized worker masses (accounting for 92.1% of the total number of Japanese workers) based on the existing labor organizations, then the future is limitless. In today's Japan, where fascist forces are rising, the sharp antagonism between the Social Mass Party and the Labor Council is undoubtedly weakening the anti-fascist forces. There is no doubt that there are anti-fascist masses within the Social Mass Party. In last year's election, one of the Social Mass Party's slogans was "anti-fascism." This slogan is closely related to the Social Mass Party's advance in parliamentary seats. The reason why Kato received the most votes was even more due to his anti-fascist propaganda.

The so-called "patriotic labor front united movement" was already embodied in 1935. However, the anti-fascist labor front united movement has not seen progress. In addition to various objective reasons, the sectarianism among leaders is indeed a major obstacle.

Current Commentary

### Twists and Turns in the Shaanxi Situation and Mediation

— Du

The Shaanxi-Gansu problem, which once caused great concern, has recently taken a sharp turn for the better. The central government has repeatedly declared its intention to be lenient, and Zhang and Yang's troops have also been withdrawing in succession in compliance with orders. The gloom of the situation is gradually dissipating, and the people are finally catching their breath. Just when there were expectations of a smooth and orderly progression without any obstacles, unexpectedly, unpredictable changes emerged again. The city gates of Xi'an were closed, and the sound of gunfire suddenly arose from within, causing the remaining people to suffer another round of panic. The nearly completed agreement suffered an unexpected setback. This was something that ordinary people could never have foreseen. Although this incident was quickly suppressed, and order in Xi'an has been restored, the underlying anxiety in people's hearts has not been eliminated, and the potential for further unrest remains. Since the Shaanxi Incident occurred, there have been so many twists and turns that it has been difficult to resolve, demonstrating the difficulty of dealing with the aftermath.

The truth of this internal strife in Xi'an is still unclear. It is said that it was due to radical elements among the officers of Zhang's troops, who were dissatisfied with the terms of the peaceful resolution and wanted to use coercion to obtain commitments from senior generals to continue their attitude of opposition to the central government. After the senior generals sternly refused, the uprising broke out. Wang Yizhe, the commander of the 67th Army of the Northeast Army, was killed, and the chief of the adjutant's office, Song Xueli, and two others died along with him. After Yang Hucheng, Yu Xuezhong, and others tried their best to suppress and persuade them, the other troops, angered by Wang's murder, also rose up in opposition. The rioting elements began to retreat outside the city, and the turmoil gradually subsided. Although this matter is not directly related to the central government's handling of the aftermath, at a time when the national crisis is urgent, and we are relying on concentrating all our efforts to serve the country, this unfortunate incident has occurred, foreshadowing a division and weakening of our strength, causing a blow to our morale. And a valiant and skilled general like Wang Yizhe died not on the battlefield, but as a victim of assassination, which is a major loss for the country. Who would not feel distressed and uneasy about this?

The incident arose suddenly and was quelled just as suddenly. On the one hand, this shows the extreme actions of the radical elements, and on the other hand, it shows that there are still many people who understand the situation. However, the greatest driving force, the weight of the invisible mediation, should still be attributed to the collective will of the entire country. The collective will demands unity and peace, and no matter what kind of force rises, it cannot be allowed to repeat the destruction of peace before the external goal has been abandoned. Any action that divides unity will ultimately yield to this collective will. Otherwise, with the lax discipline and chaotic situation of Zhang and Yang's troops, which had already caused a deteriorating situation, how could it have been quelled in such a short period of time? Is it not the collective will for peace and unity that has influenced this? This is true of this incident, and it has been true of past events as well. If the strength of the collective will is not destroyed, there is hope for the restoration of the country's fortunes.

### Eden Goes to Southern France for Two Weeks of Rest

His duties are delegated to the Prime Minister.

[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden is scheduled to depart for southern France on Saturday for a two-week vacation. During his absence, the position of Foreign Secretary will be temporarily assumed by Lord Privy Seal Viscount Halifax. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 4th)

[London] Regarding Foreign Secretary Eden's departure to southern France for a two-week rest, the Morning Post recently commented that, "Since German leader Hitler delivered his speech on the 30th of last month, there have been many important unresolved issues, such as Germany's demand for the restoration of its former colonies, which are urgent matters to be dealt with. It is rather strange for the Foreign Secretary to take a vacation at this time. As for his deputy, 'Lord Privy Seal Viscount Halifax, although he has repeatedly served as Acting Foreign Secretary, he is known to have more sympathy for Germany than Foreign Secretary Eden.'"

### Japanese Army Authorities Eager to Implement New National Defense Plan

Recognize the Urgent Need to Develop Industry; China and Japan Seek to Implement Economic Cooperation

[Nanjing] Based on the new national defense preparation plan, the Japanese army authorities are attempting to achieve a substantial enhancement of military strength. In order to implement this plan, a strong government is of course necessary, but the army hopes that the Hayashi Cabinet will first decide on its fundamental policy. According to the army's opinion, domestic industry is the foundation of the new national defense enhancement plan, so it places emphasis on its development, and links the development of "Manchukuo" industry with the new national defense enhancement plan as inseparable. It will strive to solve problems closely related to national defense, such as aviation, electricity, fuel, and steelmaking. For this purpose, it will create state organs such as the Ministry of Trade, or establish large semi-official and semi-private trading companies to promote the overseas development of Japanese goods. Therefore, the trend of Japanese politics and economy should also implement major transformations according to this policy. The diplomatic policy towards China should also be based on the harmony of Eastern nations, strengthen Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, and when the new national defense enhancement plan is completed, it will ease the previous exclusive policy towards the North, and focus on the Southern policy.

### Japanese Parliament Expected Not to Dissolve; New Cabinet Quickly Establishes Concrete Plans

[Tokyo] The Hayashi Senjuro Cabinet is currently undertaking to establish concrete policies with the greatest speed. It is heard that there is a greater possibility that the parliament will not be dissolved. The Ministry of the Army seems to no longer insist on its original position of dissolving the parliament, hoping to restore normalcy as soon as possible. Fearing widespread rumors that some within the government still advocate dissolving the parliament, more than forty members of the House of Representatives, led by veteran politician Yukio Ozaki (all of whom are not members of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties), submitted a memorandum to the parliament regarding the dissolution of the parliament, rejecting the concept of dissolving the parliament in a way that is unconstitutional, but it is generally believed that this move is only a demonstration. Most of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties do not want to make the situation more complicated, so it is generally believed that after the parliament reopens, if no unexpected events suddenly occur, the situation can be safely passed, and this belief is growing. The candidate for Foreign Minister does not want to be selected before the parliament reopens. The leaders of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently submitted a program for reforming Japan's foreign policy to Prime Minister Hayashi for his reference. (Central News Agency dispatch, 5th)

### Ministry of Finance Tentatively Abandons Baba Tax Plan

To be revised and resubmitted to Parliament

[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance held a meeting of the Tax Bureau at the Minister's official residence on the afternoon of the 4th. After discussing the previous cabinet's tax reform plan, in view of the actual situation of the financial world and the opinions of various parties, it was recognized that the original plan was not suitable for implementation. Therefore, it was decided to revise it during the parliamentary recess and submit it to the parliament. The fundamental direction of the revision is to alleviate the excessive burden on the people, while at the same time trying not to reduce tax revenue. Two concrete methods are proposed: ㊀ completely abolish Minister Baba's original reform plan and implement a simple increase in tax rates based on the current tax law, while adding some new taxes; ㊁ base on Minister Baba's original plan, modify the inappropriate parts and new taxes, or eliminate useless parts. After discussion, it seems that it was decided to abandon the Baba original plan, base on the current tax law, and adopt the method of increasing taxes and setting up new taxes. In that case, the first type of the second kind of income tax and its combined taxation on the third kind will of course be implemented moderately. Regarding the new tax issue, in Minister Baba's original plan, the transaction tax should be abolished, the property tax should also be completely abolished, or only the part of increasing taxes for corporations should be retained. As for the foreign currency debt, special debt, and securities transfer tax, all will be subject to considerable revisions. Regarding the trade control tax and export control tax, there is still a strong opinion on setting it up. The Ministry of Finance intends to re-examine the national tax and local tax revisions because they are related to the local financial adjustment allocation. (Allied Press dispatch, 5th)

### Prime Minister Hayashi Selects Full-Time Cabinet Members

[Tokyo] The current Cabinet members of the Hayashi Cabinet, such as Yuki, Yamazaki, and Godo, are mostly concurrent cabinet members. However, in preparation for the reopening of parliament, the Hayashi Cabinet plans to quickly find suitable talents and set up full-time cabinet members in the ministries that are currently held concurrently. It is in the process of searching for candidates, and it has been internally decided to set up a full-time Minister of Communications before the parliament reopens. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education are also scheduled to set up full-time ministers at appropriate times, but the Minister of Railways and the Minister of Colonial Affairs will be temporarily held concurrently by cabinet members. (Allied Press dispatch, 5th)

### Japanese Shipbuilding Industry Booming

Steel Mills Plan to Increase Production

[Tokyo] Last year, Japanese shipyards received orders for a total of 116 new ships, with a gross weight of 736,250 tons. Ships under 1,000 tons have not been included. At the end of last year, there were a total of 142 ships, totaling 836,950 tons, either under construction or scheduled to begin construction this year. However, due to the shortage of steel, many orders cannot be fulfilled as scheduled. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry currently estimates that the total amount of steel needed in Japan from April this year to the end of March next year is approximately 500,000 tons. Nippon Steel Corporation and several other steel companies have expanded their factory facilities, so it is expected that production can be increased soon to meet the needs of the country. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry currently believes that the recent rise in steel prices is due to manipulation by speculators. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 5th)

### US Naval Construction Plan

Faces Stagnation Due to Dispute Between Government and Business

[Washington] The US naval construction plan is on the verge of stagnation due to a dispute between the government and the business community. It is said that steel mills and steel manufacturers are not supplying the necessary materials to the naval authorities as a form of protest against the Walsh-Healey Act. The Act stipulates a 40-hour work week, and this provision and other measures must be observed by manufacturers who want to undertake government projects. However, the steel mills are currently operating at full capacity, and even with a 48-hour work week, they are unable to meet the demand, and are reluctant to reduce working hours by accepting government projects. Government projects are smaller than private orders, and the manufacturers feel that it is not worth it to reduce working hours by accepting government projects. Furthermore, the Navy Department recently announced a tender to purchase 2,735,000 pounds of copper. The authorities received bids for 1,035,000 pounds, but the government could only purchase 885,000 pounds, the rest of which did not comply with the provisions of the Walsh-Healey Act. On December 4th of last year, the naval authorities again wanted to purchase 25 million pounds of steel, but the manufacturers only submitted bids for 7 million pounds, and all had to be rejected because they violated the Walsh-Healey Act. In this situation, if there are no other developments recently, the planned construction of two battleships, each with 35,000 tons, will be impossible to start. The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, which is currently building several submarines, is likely to shut down, and the materials stored at the Washington Navy Yard are also gradually becoming scarce. It is reported that the naval authorities consulted with Labor Secretary Perkins, that the manufacturers' bids for steel could be temporarily exempted from complying with the Walsh-Healey Act, but Perkins refused to accept this method, and labor leader Lewis fundamentally opposed this method. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 4th)

### French Three-Year Naval Construction Program

Under Consideration by Authorities

[Paris] Naval correspondent Laborie of the "Petit Parisien" newspaper recently published an article on the French Navy, stating that the total tonnage of the national navy is currently 630,000 tons, and is expected to increase to 850,000 tons within a few years, including many of the latest warships. To prevent delays in naval construction, the government intends to request that the parliament pass the naval construction program for the next three years at the same time. Because parliamentary debates on naval construction programs often take a long time, this is the main reason for past delays in naval construction. For example, although the battleship "Dunkerque" is the most superior warship in the world, construction only began after eighteen months of parliamentary debate, due to the opposition of the majority party members to the construction of battleships several years ago. The delay is evident. Furthermore, since the parliament passed a law stipulating that workers should work 40 hours per week, although the number of workers in shipyards has increased by 11%, they still need to work overtime to make up for the shortfall. The government should also train skilled workers to meet urgent needs. As for the government's three-year naval construction program, it is currently under study. The content will roughly include the following types of warships: ⑴ One or two 15,000-ton aircraft carriers, capable of carrying 40 aircraft, with a speed of 30 knots per hour; ⑵ Several 8,000-ton cruisers; ⑶ A squadron of torpedo boats; ⑷ Ten or so first-class and second-class submarines. (Havas dispatch from the 5th)

### Asian Labor Conference to be Convened

Council of State Drafts Report Recommending Three Items for Agenda

[Geneva] At the International Labor Conference held in June of last year, a proposal put forward by labor representatives from India and Japan was passed, advocating the convening of an Asian Labor Conference in Asia to seek to develop cooperation between Asian countries and the International Labor Office. It was decided that the Council of the International Labor Office should draft a report. The report has now been drafted and will be jointly reviewed tomorrow by the Asian members of the Council of the International Labor Office. It is reported that the report suggests including the following three issues on the agenda of the Asian Labor Conference: ⑴ The issue of Asian countries participating in the International Labor Organization; ⑵ The impact of industrial development and population conditions in Asian countries on immigration issues; ⑶ The issue of establishing a permanent labor committee for Asian countries. The report also argues that in addition to the participation of countries such as Afghanistan, China, India, Iran, Iraq, Japan, and Siam, the Asian Labor Conference should also include colonial powers from Europe and the Americas, such as the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal. As for the expenses of the Asian Labor Conference, if held in Tokyo, Japan, it would cost approximately 275,000 Swiss francs; if held in Mumbai, India, it would cost approximately 200,000 Swiss francs.

### British Regency Bill

Passed Third Reading in Lower House

[London] The Regency Bill was unanimously passed for the third reading in the Lower House tonight. When the bill was under consideration by the review committee in the Lower House, it agreed to the amendment proposed by Home Secretary Simon, that is, increasing the necessary number of people required to declare that the monarch is unable to perform his duties and needs to appoint a regent from three to four. However, it was later fixed at three, and the number of people with the power to declare was reduced to five, in order to remove one person who could be a regent. Simon also proposed an amendment, deleting the phrase "the regent should reside in Britain" and replacing it with "should be residing in any part of Britain," in case the appointed regent happens to be serving as the Governor-General of a dominion or temporarily residing in a dominion. This section was also approved by the committee. Simon also stated that in the event that the Emperor travels abroad or is temporarily unable to govern, the State Council should be composed of the Queen, the Duke of Gloucester, the Duke of Kent, the Princess Royal, and Prince Connaught. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, the 4th)

### U.S. Pacific Coast Sailors Return to Work

Strike Lasts 98 Days with Significant Losses; Workers Vote to Approve Interim Measures

[San Francisco] The Sailors' Strike Committee today notified shipping companies on the Pacific Coast that the sailors' strike, which has lasted three months and caused the stagnation of shipping in various ports on the West Coast and Honolulu, has been completely resolved, and the striking sailors will return to work in full force at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow. The Joint Committee of the Union also confirmed this news, stating that union workers have completed voting and the majority have approved of ending the strike, so the labor unrest has indeed ended. However, this worker vote did not include firemen, oilers, and cleaners, but the departure of ships will not be delayed as a result. It is reported that the Pacific Coast maritime strike has lasted for 98 days, with losses estimated at around 100 million yuan. The general public is very happy about the end of the strike, but this resumption of work is in fact only a truce, not permanent peace. Several issues remain unresolved, including: ⑴ Firemen's union workers are still dissatisfied with the terms negotiated by the union representatives and the shipping association; ⑵ The strike by barge workers in Los Angeles and San Francisco has not yet been resolved; ⑶ Shipyard workers in San Francisco and Seattle are still on strike; ⑷ Dockworkers in Honolulu are difficult to deal with; ⑸ Weighers, clerks, and inspectors on the West Coast have unanimously expressed dissatisfaction with the previously established agreement. Among them, the firemen's strike is more serious, with 1,234 firemen opposing the return to work terms and only 857 in favor, but all agree to temporarily resume work and then resolve the issues of wages and working conditions. Shipping companies and firemen have both informally expressed hope for a satisfactory resolution. (Dispatch from the 4th, National News)

[San Francisco] The maritime unions of various U.S. Pacific ports, which went on strike on October 30th of last year due to disputes with employers over wages and employment methods, declared a resolution today after 98 days. The sailors have agreed to return to work immediately. It is reported that this labor unrest spread widely, and maritime unions in various ports along the Atlantic coast also implemented slowdowns in support. During the Pacific ports sailors' strike, commerce stagnated, and even Hawaii and Alaska were affected, with travelers stranded and food supplies running out. The losses suffered by the shipping companies were naturally considerable. Subsequently, the Shipping Commission, the Shipping Association, and the maritime unions conducted negotiations, and it was decided on the 31st of last month that the sailors would hold a vote to resolve the issue. By the time the voting results came out, the sailors had unanimously accepted the interim measures, and the labor unrest that had been delayed for more than three months came to an end.

### U.S. Auto Strike Remains Deadlocked

Governor's Mediation Ineffective

Detroit: Representatives of auto workers and General Motors met all day today, adjourning in the evening. Except for Michigan Governor Murphy, who said that discussions would continue until 10 p.m., no statement was issued. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, the 4th)

Detroit: Michigan Governor Murphy attempted to convene meetings between labor and management to mediate the General Motors auto strike, but all three meetings were unsuccessful, so hopes for the strike's resolution have vanished again. The first meeting was held on Wednesday, the second yesterday, and the third last night, lasting all night but failing to break the deadlock. At the same time, the Flint Police Department has recruited 1,000 special police officers, who will be available to serve once the General Motors authorities decide to evict workers occupying the factory. The company authorities have obtained court permission to suppress the workers' actions. To prevent workers from causing trouble after drinking, Flint has banned the sale of alcohol.

### Second Day of the International Eucharistic Congress

Priests and Bishops Gather to Discuss Catholic Unity

[Manila] Today is the second day of the 33rd International Eucharistic Congress. 75,000 believers from 54 countries warmly welcomed Vatican Minister Basili and Archbishop Dougherty of this place's radio message, "I am deeply pleased with the victory of Jesus. The piety and prayers of the Congress to the Holy Father also move me deeply." Then, Bishop Guerrero of Lingayen preached to the Congress, followed by speeches from many bishops, conveying the blessings of various countries to the Congress. Finally, 1,200 priests, bishops, and archbishops from fifteen countries held a meeting in the cathedral to discuss Catholic unity. (Dispatch from the 4th, National News)

[Manila] The International Eucharistic Congress was originally scheduled to hold its second plenary session in Luneta Park today, but it was unable to proceed as scheduled due to heavy rain. Only the various groups held separate meetings. During the meeting of the Spanish group, Philippine Congressman Romualdez gave a speech, saying, "Catholic progress associations in various countries must organize a resistance movement against communism." Most members were shocked upon hearing that the Congress was interfering in political and legal matters. (Havas dispatch from the 5th)

### Italy Prepares to Sign Non-Aggression Pact with Balkan Countries

Southern Army of 1.5 Million Ready for Anything; Italy and Yugoslavia Repair Old Ties, a Factor for Peace in Central Europe

Turkish Capital: Official sources have revealed that after Foreign Minister Rushdi, in his capacity as Turkish Foreign Minister and Chairman of the Standing Political Council of the Balkan Entente, held talks with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, Italy, Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Greece are likely to sign an Eastern Mediterranean Mutual Assistance and Non-Aggression Pact in the near future. Regarding this matter, Ciano will meet with Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović and Greek Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Metaxas within days. What Rushdi discussed with Ciano in Milan yesterday was the issue of Italy joining the Montreux Convention (according to this convention, Turkey can re-fortify the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus Straits) and the Eastern Mediterranean Pact. In addition, Ciano has no intention of alienating the relationship between Soviet Russia and Turkey. (Havas dispatch from the 5th)

Yugoslavia: In the capital, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović, attending the Finance Committee of the House of Representatives, declared, "Our army should have as many as 1.5 million men, which can be called the most elite force in Europe. It will certainly defend the country and not fail in its duties. But it must be stated that although our military and civilians are prepared for any eventuality, we dare not slack off in the slightest. However, the policy of peace will still be promoted unceasingly. Italy is originally in favor of maintaining good relations with our country, and our country, both government and public, also have the same desire. As for the Anglo-Italian Gentleman's Agreement concluded at the beginning of last month, which aims to maintain the status quo in the Mediterranean, it is naturally related to our country's borders. The British and Italian governments have formally notified our country of the content of the agreement. In addition, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, in his speech in Milan at the beginning of November last year, proposed to repair old ties with our country. We are now eagerly awaiting the country to follow up with practical actions. In this way, Italy and Yugoslavia should become good neighbors and be on good terms with each other."

### German Ambassador Performs Nazi Salute to British King

Violates Diplomatic Conventions

[London] When King George VI received ambassadors and ministers from various countries at Buckingham Palace yesterday, the German Ambassador to Britain, Ribbentrop, performed a Nazi salute to him. All the newspapers have commented on this. The Daily Herald reported, "When the palace staff announced the name of the German Ambassador Ribbentrop, the ambassador immediately stepped forward several paces, stood at attention, and extended his right hand, performing a Nazi salute to the King. Then he advanced three steps, stood at attention, and extended his right hand again. Finally, he advanced one step, stood at attention, and saluted as before. The King responded with a bow." The News Chronicle reported, "This incident has caused unease in diplomatic circles. Ribbentrop may resign and return home. Although there are many powerful figures in the British Conservative Party who are friendly with him, most cabinet members said that the ambassador's actions were propaganda for National Socialism and had violated diplomatic conventions. In addition, the ambassador has been traveling between London and Berlin since taking office, failing to reside in his post for a long time, which is also inappropriate. Moreover, the ambassador even participated in drafting the speech given by his head of state Hitler in the House of Commons on the 30th of last month, which is well known to people in Downing Street and therefore makes them dissatisfied."

Peace Treaty Exists in Name Only; Military Strength Gives Confidence

Hamburg Propaganda Minister Goebbels gave a speech here yesterday to an audience of 30,000 people, saying, "The Treaty of Versailles now exists in name only.

### German Guarantee of Belgian and Dutch Neutrality

German Explanation Ambiguous; Fails to Satisfy Belgium

Brussels: "Dernière Heure" recently reported that when German Head of State Hitler gave a speech in the House of Representatives the other day, he said that Germany was prepared to guarantee the neutrality of Belgium and the Netherlands. The Belgian government, believing that the meaning of this statement was not clear enough, immediately requested the German government to provide a detailed explanation. It is now reported that the German government has submitted a reply, but its content only cites the memorandum sent by Germany to the relevant countries on March 30 of last year (that is, the peace plan proposed by Hitler). In other words, regarding the neutral status of Belgium and the Netherlands, Germany only made empty and general declarations, without providing any concrete suggestions. Therefore, the Belgian authorities believe that this German guarantee is ambiguous, empty, and conditional, and cannot be compared with the concrete and clear guarantees proposed by Britain and France.

### Disputes over Hunan's Construction of Tianhu Polder and Manganese Mines Near Xiamen Encroaching on Dongting Lake

People in Hunan and Hubei Provinces Voice Opposition; Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission Sends Personnel for Thorough Investigation

Hankou Correspondence – Dongting Lake is a natural reservoir of the Yangtze River. Recently, Hunan Province constructed Tianhu Polder, encroaching on 13% of the existing lake area. This water conservancy issue has caused significant political waves in Hunan Province. The resignation of Finance Director He Hao, and the proposed partial reorganization of the Hunan Provincial Government, are due to this reason. As for Hubei Province, there is even more public outcry because it is "making a drain for itself at the expense of its neighbor." The Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission also attaches great importance to this matter and has specially dispatched the Director of the Engineering Department, Sun Liangshi, to Hankou yesterday to go to Hunan for a thorough investigation. It is expected that there will be an appropriate solution in the shortest period. Previously, Ye Kaixin, a senator of the Military Council, returned to Hunan at the end of last year and, together with the old Tianhu Polder directors, borrowed 500,000 yuan from the Hunan Provincial Bank to build Tianhu Polder. The polder covers an area of over 400,000 mu, approximately 13% of the existing Dongting Lake area. The first to oppose it was the Hunan Flood Relief Committee, whose rationale was that they have been planning Dongting Lake water conservancy for years. Although they have not been able to carry out large-scale dredging due to funding issues, local projects such as the Zhucikou diversion canal, widening of the Hao River and the Linzi and Liangko openings, and the establishment of hydrological stations have been carried out successively and have been somewhat effective. Now, suddenly, while talking about water conservancy, they are building Tianhu Polder, reclaiming Datu Lake, and blocking part of the existing entire lake area. How is this different from building a lake on one side and blocking a lake on the other, preventing disasters on one side and creating disasters on the other? Therefore, a meeting of the entire committee was convened, and it was decided to send a letter to the Hunan Provincial Government to request relief, so as to preserve the lake area and reduce disasters. The Hunan Provincial Government then invited Hunan University professor and Flood Relief Committee engineer Xiao Guangjiong, together with committee member Zhou Fengjiu, to conduct a survey. According to the report, it was also believed that the polder should not be built. Other oppositions followed, like clouds rising. The people of the counties along the river in Hubei Province believe that if the polder is built, the water storage capacity of Dongting Lake will naturally decrease. If the Yangtze River rises and Dongting cannot accommodate it, it will drive eastward, and Hubei Province will bear the brunt. The massive disaster that will be caused in the future will not be comparable to that of the 20th year of the Republic. This policy of benefiting oneself at the expense of one's neighbor is absolutely unacceptable, and a telegram has been sent to all parties resolutely opposing it. Recently, the Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Authority expressed its opinion on the matter, stating, "Dongting Lake is the original natural reservoir in the Hunan and Hubei regions, relying on Songzi, Taiping, Ouchi, Tiaoxian, and Chenglingji and Hukou, to regulate the flow of the river. The original water storage area of the lake was 6,780 square kilometers, of which 2,340 square kilometers were occupied by polders, accounting for more than one-third of the total area. Moreover, the lake fields in Yiyang, Xiangyin, Yuanjiang, Hanshou, Nanxian, Changde, Huarong, Anxiang, Lixian, Yueyang, and Linxiang, which border the lake, account for more than 50% of the cultivated land in these counties. Every time a silt island appears, the gentry and wealthy people individually or jointly obtain licenses from the Lake Field Bureau, paying only a few jiao per mu, and then they can reclaim it. According to the Anxiang County Chronicle, during the Daoguang and Tongzhi years, Anxiang had only 14 lake polders. Fifty years ago, there were only over one hundred polders. Now, Anxiang has reached more than six hundred and thirty lake polders, with a total cultivated area of over 600,000 mu. The establishment of Nanxian County is only forty years in history. Initially, it should be in the ninth capital of Huarong, called Nanzhou Hall. Later, siltation increased daily, cultivated land gradually increased, and the population became more numerous, so the county seat was changed. The speed of new polders can be seen from this. The unplanned construction of Tianhu Polder this time is actually competing with water for land, making the reservoir smaller and smaller, and the capacity is decreasing. The future is dangerous, and it is truly unimaginable. If we want to seek urgent relief, the Hunan Provincial Government must follow President Chiang's proposal in the 20th year of the Republic to return the fields to the lake, and the recently promulgated Outline and Implementation Measures for the Consolidation of Farmland Water Conservancy by the Executive Yuan. Decisively prohibit construction and hope that the Economic Committee will comprehensively determine the water distribution area between Hunan and Hubei provinces, and no silt islands may continue to be reclaimed. The original island lake polders and dikes within the water distribution area should be abolished or restricted in height, so that they are one or two meters lower than the main dike, so as to avoid the increasing flood disaster, and the phenomenon that the Yangtze River rises slightly every year, and reports of floods are reported everywhere, officials and people are busy and panicked, and China and foreign countries are shocked can also be expected to be avoided.” (February 3)

### Continued Criticism of Illegal Mining of Iron Ore Near Xiamen

Not Yet Proven That the Background is a Certain National; Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Survey and Start Mining

Xiamen Correspondence - It was reported earlier that Lu Zancheng, the head of the Jianyuanyuan Mining Cooperative, was mining without permission at the Saizai Mountain mine pit in Huli Village (also known as Zhukeng Lake Village) in the Heshan Special Zone outside Xiamen City. It has now been discovered that Lu signed a contract with Yang Fubin, the representative of the Yang surname villagers in Zhukeng Lake, on behalf of the cooperative, and Yang Qingmao, the village chief of Zhukeng Lake, signed as a witness. The contract was signed on December 23rd and 24th of last year. Mining exploration had already started half a month before the signing. By the time it was cracked down on January 19th, it had become a mine pit with a diameter of one zhang and a depth of seven zhang, with a horizontal excavation depth of two zhang at the bottom of the pit. According to Lu, the ore is manganese ore, but the Xiamen Star Daily reported at the time that it was tungsten ore and claimed that there was a background of a certain party, and the mined ore was being smuggled out of the port, etc. According to Liu Jitang, the director of the Special Zone Office, Lu had come to the office to register before excavating the mine, but had not yet been approved. Lu and others had already started work without authorization. This point is already illegal. The most important thing at present is whether Lu has a background or not, which must be strictly investigated. As for Yang Fubin and Yang Qingmao, they have been granted bail on the grounds of ignorance. Lu is still in custody. Lu's hometown is Quanzhou. As for whether his mining has a background, it has been more than half a month, and there is still no confirmation. It is still under investigation by the Special Zone Office. As for the quality of the ore in the pit, Chen Gaozhi, a technician sent by the Construction Department, confirmed that it was hard manganese, not tungsten ore. Lu and others had just approached the ore vein and had not yet reached the ore layer, so they had not yet had time to steal it. It is reported that hard manganese can be used for steelmaking. Although its need for military industrial is not as important as tungsten, it is also one of the military raw materials, so its value is very high. The provincial government has now sent technician Li Qishan to Xiamen in the coming days to conduct a detailed survey and start mining. As for the report here that a certain national is the background, it has not yet been proven. However, it is suspicious for a private individual to invest in mining exploration in order to seek uncertain profits. Also, the miner Li Wenying is currently a technician at the Anxi Zhongyu Mining Company and has lived in Taiwan. Whether he is Taiwanese and what kind of person he is, and the identity of an unknown shareholder in the cooperative, are all highly suspicious. (February 5).

### Sichuan and Guangdong Provinces Purchase and Transport Large Quantities of Rice in Anhui

Anhui and Jiangxi Establish Tea Trade Company in Shanghai; Local Banks Provide Industrial and Commercial Loans

Wuhu Correspondence – Due to the bumper agricultural harvests in Anhui Province last year, the output of rice has increased sharply, the rural economy has been activated, and various businesses have also shown a trend of prosperity. Recently, during the abandoned lunar New Year, there is an unprecedented atmosphere of prosperity. The market is very stable, and the official support and promotion are even more exciting. I will describe the recent trends in rice and tea sales, and the status of local banks implementing industrial and commercial loans, so that you can know that Anhui Province's commerce and finance are making great efforts to move forward.

Guangdong Province has recently experienced another rice shortage, so officials and merchants are actively purchasing rice in Wuhu to transport to Guangdong to provide disaster relief for the people. Officials are commissioned by the Central Trust Bureau to be collected by the Wuhu Central Bank, and 45,000 shi have been purchased successively and transported. Recently, another 40,000 shi have been purchased and stored. Today, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will ship 20,000 shi by sea first. The merchants are the Guangchao rice shops stationed in Wuhu, who are also actively bidding for purchase. From autumn to now, over 1 million shi have been transported to Guangdong. According to statistics, various shops still have over 200,000 shi in stock waiting for transportation. However, at this time, Sichuan Province upstream has also experienced a serious rice shortage, and rice prices have soared, and there is no goods to meet the market. Therefore, the Sichuan Provincial Government has specially sent Commissioner Wei Wenhan and Chen Qidong, the section chief of the Agricultural Bureau, to Wuhu to purchase 30,000 shi of rice from Anhui to transport to Sichuan to rush for price control. The first batch of 5,500 shi has been exported yesterday, and purchases will continue in the future. The authorities of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces have decided to expand the sales of tea this year through consultation, and all measures have been determined. The Bank of Communications has decided to lend 2.5 million yuan, which will be paid by the Anhui Provincial Local Bank Jiangxi Yumin Bank. Recently, officials and businessmen in the two provinces have agreed to establish a tea trade company in Shanghai to facilitate sales abroad. The regulations are being drafted, and it can be established after the new tea is launched this year. As for manufacturing improvement, the government has decided to establish large-scale tea factories in the center of each tea-producing area, purchase machinery, and carry out rationalized large-scale manufacturing, so as to reduce costs and standardize quality, and compete with teas from India, Ceylon, and Java in the international market. The Qi Dou Tea Improvement Farm has compiled a design for a 10,000-box black tea manufacturing factory and submitted it to the Construction Department for review and implementation.

In order to promote the widespread development of industry and commerce, the Anhui Local Bank has specially launched small industrial and commercial loans. The total amount of loans is tentatively set at 20,000 yuan each in Wuhu, Huaining, and Bengbu, and 10,000 yuan each in Xuan city, Guangde, Nanling, Shouxian, Chu county, Hefei, and Shucheng. The maximum amount of each household loan is limited to 500 yuan, the term shall not exceed three months, and the monthly interest rate is 1%. Borrowers must seal up goods as collateral and must be guaranteed by the county government, chamber of commerce, or trade association. The Wuhu General Bank has telegraphed the above-mentioned branches or offices yesterday to carefully handle in accordance with the regulations and methods from now on. In addition, the bank plans to issue one-jiao, two-jiao, and five-jiao transfer notes, which are currently being printed and will be issued soon to regulate the market. (4th)

### US University of California Joint Basketball Team Performs in Shanghai Last Night

Won Against Shanghai Mixed Team by Forty to Twenty-Eight Points; US Team's Swift and Well-Coordinated Moves Admirable

The University of California Joint Basketball Team, invited to perform in the Philippines, passed through Shanghai yesterday on their way back to the United States. The sports news department of the Western Shanghai Continental Daily specially invited them to give a performance and organized a Chinese-Western mixed team to compete against them last night at the Shen Garden. Throughout the game, the situation was extremely tense. In the second half, the score was tied four times, which shows its intensity. However, in the last three minutes, things took a sharp turn for the worse, and the American team scored twelve points in a row, thus defeating the Shanghai Mixed Team by a score of forty to twenty-eight. In the first half, the All-Star Team was only ahead by three points, with a score of eighteen to fifteen. Both sides showed their unique performances, which were exceptionally brilliant. The team will take the original Chichibu Maru to Japan today and then return to the United States.

The Color of the Visiting Team

The University of California team's tactics, like Shanghai's Mai Ling, are exceptionally swift. When they reach the opponent's basket, the five players move like a well-coordinated machine, seeking gaps to enter, and mostly shooting under the basket, rarely shooting from afar. They all wave their hands with a single hand and hit the basket. Unfortunately, there are still some deficiencies in their shooting accuracy, perhaps due to unfamiliarity with the venue or being in a foreign land for the first time. Center Howell, who is over six feet tall, is not particularly special. However, the two forwards, Browning and Moss, are terribly active. In a word, the team's technique is simply swift and well-coordinated.

The Shanghai Team is Very Good

The Shanghai Mixed Team invited Li Zhenzhong and Yin Hongxiang to Shanghai to help. It was not until a few minutes before the game that they arrived. The Shanghai Mixed Team is also made up entirely of all-stars. In the first half, they were unable to score many times due to a lack of coordination. Among the forwards, there was still something missing. Locke was too stiff, and Feng Nianhua was too short. However, the individual skills of the other four players, Li Zhenzhong, Shi Guiya, Yin Hongxiang, and Carson, were not inferior to those of the American team. The performances of Li, Yin, and Carson were particularly unique. The fierceness of their competition can be imagined to give the opponent four ties. If they add more well-coordinated teamwork, there is a great hope of defeating the American team.

Only Three Points Behind

Li Zhenzhong's jump ball was not weaker than the opponent's tall man. After the game started, Yin Hongxiang got the first throwing opportunity, but unfortunately it did not go in. Moss fouled, and Yin first made a free throw, opening the record. As it was for several minutes, they failed to score. After the American team called a timeout, Li Zhenzhong added two more points, and the Shanghai team suddenly took the lead with a score of three to zero. The game was tense, and the American team did not seem to score. The difference between the two sides was only one, two, or three points. The Shanghai team was only slightly behind. The American team added Widdis to replace center Howell, and the Shanghai team also replaced Locke with Shi Guiya. At the end of the first half, the American team was only ahead by three points with a score of eighteen to fifteen.

Tied Four Times

At the beginning of the second half, Locke replaced Feng Nianhua, and Howell was re-appointed as the opponent's center. Both sides committed numerous fouls, each scoring with free throws. Carson and Li Zhenzhong scored three free throws in a row, and the Shanghai team made their first tie at eighteen each. The performances of both sides entered a better state, with scores of eighteen each, twenty each, and even twenty-six each, and the shape of the match was extremely tense. At this time, Yin Hongxiang got a chance to foul the opposing captain Browning, but unexpectedly, he missed both free throws, which was a pity. On the other hand, Browning waved his hand with a single hand and scored, and the American team was two points ahead again with a score of twenty-eight to twenty-six. Carson scored, and it was a tie again. With only three minutes left to the end, the American team suddenly showed their power, and Browning and Howell scored one after another, so their momentum became unstoppable. The Shanghai team lost twelve points in a row and lost by a score of twenty-eight to forty.

### The Battle of Manila

(A dispatch from our reporter in the Philippines, Yan Wenchou)

(Special Dispatch from Manila) The Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation, in order to enhance the observation of the Philippine basketball team, specifically invited the alumni basketball team of the University of Southern California to come to Manila for eight matches. The team accepted the invitation and arrived in Manila on the eleventh day of the first month, a group of eight people. Except for one player who was a basketball player from the University of Iowa, the rest were all players from the University of California. However, none of them had attended the World Games this time. Their physique was extraordinary and mighty, the tallest being six feet one inch, and the shortest being five feet nine inches. The heaviest weighed one hundred and ninety pounds, and the lightest weighed one hundred and sixty-five pounds, which were indeed unmatched by Orientals. The guard could almost reach the basket with a single jump. The result of the matches was seven wins and one loss. Their loss was only by one point, which can also be said to be a complete victory. The results of each match are detailed below:

President's Reception

On the day of arrival in Manila, they went straight to the Presidential Palace to pay respects to Philippine President Quezon. Due to his ill health, the Secretary-General came out to receive them. President Quezon granted another audience on the morning of the twelfth, extending great comfort to the team for their long journey. They stayed at the YMCA of the U.S. Army and Navy in the Philippines. The Athletic Federation wholeheartedly took on the responsibility of entertaining them.

Changing Basketball Skills

During the first match, they played lightly and sketched casually, without any effort, which greatly dissatisfied the audience. It seemed that with such slow passing, they would definitely be defeated by the Philippine team. Sure enough, in the second match against the Philippine basketball runner-up, the San Beda University team, they lost by a narrow margin. The general audience was even more disappointed. In the third match, the Philippine basketball champion team, the San Sebastian College–Recoletos team, which has always been known for its iron army, came out to play. The Philippine team that attended this World Games was based on this team. That night, the audience was especially large. Before the tip-off at 1:30, all the seats were filled, and more than a thousand people could not get in. The psychology of the audience this time was to watch the San Sebastian College–Recoletos players show off their skills and defeat this burly and mighty American team, not leaving a single piece of armor intact. However, the reality was even more unexpected. That night, the American team, also at a critical juncture where its reputation was at stake, changed its strategy, focusing on tight passing and accurate shooting to win. Despite the San Sebastian College–Recoletos team's exhausted screams and the cheers of the Filipino crowd throughout the arena, they were ultimately unable to reverse the defeat.

Crowded Audience

After defeating the champion San Sebastian College–Recoletos team, the fans were even more excited. Therefore, the seats for the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh matches were all reserved in advance. The Rizal Memorial Basketball Coliseum can only accommodate more than 8,000 spectators, divided into four classes with prices of one peso and five centavos, one peso and two centavos, eight centavos, and four centavos. The first two classes of seats have numbers and can be reserved in advance. The third and fourth classes are seated on a first-come, first-served basis. Because there was a problem of overcrowding in the third and fourth matches, those who arrived late were left out. Therefore, later, people brought bread to fill their stomachs and occupy seats three hours before the start of the game. The arena also widely set up bulletin boards, and the results of each point were announced outside, so that those who could not get in could also know the situation in the arena and feel comforted rather than running in vain.

Audience's Mischief

Filipinos watch basketball games entirely to cheer for their own side, without respecting the visiting team. In the past, when our country's teams went to the Philippines to compete, the bad impressions were always caused by the Filipino audience's unreasonable jeering, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the overseas Chinese audience and led to disputes. This time, they also wanted to use unreasonable ridicule to make the American team angry and disrupt their formation. In the seventh match against the World Games team, when the Filipino referee penalized the Philippine team with a free throw, the audience was in an uproar, accusing him of being unfair and throwing fruit peels and miscellaneous objects into the arena like butterflies flying around. The police also didn't know whether to laugh or cry and couldn't stop them, forcing the American team to almost leave the arena immediately and end the game. Fortunately, the authorities of the Athletic Federation came out to explain everything before the game could continue to the end. In the eighth match, until the end of the second quarter, the Philippine team was leading by four points, and the audience cheered wildly, almost shaking the walls, thinking that they could avenge their shame. Unexpectedly, the American team responded calmly and showed amazing skills, finally turning defeat into victory, which made thousands of Filipinos very dejected.

Filipino Revenue

The round-trip expenses for the American team this time were only about 8,000 Philippine pesos. It is estimated that nearly 30,000 pesos can be collected from the eight matches. The surplus earned by the Athletic Federation this time is considerable.

### Zhu Qiliang Wins Amateur Billiards Group A Championship

Result: 2,000 Points vs. 1,961 Points Zhang Yingda Strived Repeatedly but Ultimately Failed

Zhu Qiliang, with his calm spirit and careful technique, finally defeated Zhang Yingda in the extremely tense final stage, reaching the 2,000-point mark first and winning this year's Shanghai Amateur Billiards Group A Championship. This is also the great reward for Zhu's years of hard work and practice, and his golden age is gradually appearing. Zhu should strive for further progress to achieve greater success.

Zhu's initial victory over Ding Mingyi relied on good luck. At that time, Zhu was more than 150 points behind, but in the last few shots, Zhu took the lead. In the semi-finals, Zhu calmly defeated Wu Chengxiang and won the right to the finals. In the final four matches, Zhu benefited from the second match, winning more than 220 points. In the first and third matches, the two sides were neck and neck, with limited differences. The fourth match was quite unfavorable, but fortunately, he had won too many points. Even when he was at a disadvantage, he was still able to cheer up and maintain his composure. The championship title belonged to him. At the beginning of this Group A Championship, Medina was originally the most popular, followed by Zhang Yingda and Ding Mingyi. Unexpectedly, Zhu Qiliang emerged as a dark horse, defeating Ding and Zhang in succession and replacing them. This can be said to be an anomaly.

Zhang Yingda, last year's runner-up, was once again controlled by his bad luck and missed the golden opportunity. In the last 100-point competition, he still ranked second. When the third match started yesterday, the two sides were on the same level. The fourth match then changed greatly. Zhang went from being 235 points behind (1290 vs. 1545) to discovering huge scores of 65, 34, 45, 34, 37, etc., winning more than 40 points and surpassing Zhu (1716 vs. 1676). Unexpectedly, Zhang was careless many times and missed many good opportunities. Zhu then soared again, scoring 79 points in one shot and taking the lead again. From then on, Zhang was still in adversity, following behind Zhu. When the score reached 1909 vs. 1971, another opportunity for a comeback came. He had already scored 52 points in one shot. Unexpectedly, at the critical moment, he missed the opportunity. Zhu then reached the final goal of 2,000 points, winning only 39 points more than Zhang Yingda. The last match lasted the longest, starting at 9:15 and ending at 12:45.

Zhu Qiliang (Front Row) 42, 29, 35, 24, 21, 16, 40, 25, 38, 24, 29, (Back Row) 27, 24, 79, 20, 27, 24

Zhang Yingda (Front Row) 26, 22, 31, 36, 38, 44, 27, 33, 30, (Back Row) 65, 24, 31, 34, 13, 26, 45, 27, 34, 37, 22, 21, 51

### Ministry of Education Formulates Measures to Promote Vocational Supplementary Education

(Nanjing, 5th) The Ministry of Education issued an order to all departments and bureaus, stating that the promotion of vocational education in various provinces and cities has recently laid a foundation. However, it is urgent to supplement the knowledge and skills that workers and apprentices who are already engaged in vocational work should have in order to increase work efficiency. Those who volunteer to engage in vocational work will be taught vocational knowledge and skills so that they can have the opportunity to serve. The Ministry has promulgated the regulations on vocational supplementary schools and ordered them to be followed. In the past three years, various provinces and cities have paid little attention to this educational facility. Now, the Ministry has formulated the outline of measures for various provinces and cities to promote vocational supplementary education and issued them together. Please follow them and prepare detailed implementation measures before the end of March and submit them to the Ministry for approval. The main points of the outline of measures for vocational supplementary education are as follows:

1.  The educational administrative organs of all provinces and cities should follow the provisions of this outline of measures to earnestly promote vocational supplementary education and prepare detailed implementation measures and submit them to the Ministry for record.
2.  Regarding the establishment of vocational supplementary schools, 甲. All vocational schools, rural normal schools, and secondary normal schools with special labor equipment should make use of their original equipment and talents to do their best to run vocational supplementary schools with the same nature as the schools. 乙. Universities and specialized schools should hold advanced vocational primary supplementary classes or short-term vocational training classes to provide in-depth subject supplementary studies for those who already have jobs. 丙. All vocational groups in various industries should cooperate with vocational schools and other equivalent schools to make use of school equipment to run vocational supplementary schools or vocational training classes related to this industry. Those industries that have not organized groups should quickly organize and hold this major industry. 凡. Universities, specialized schools, vocational schools, and rural normal schools that run vocational supplementary education should be listed as extension undertakings. The number of classes run should be determined according to the capacity of the school's equipment. The location of the school is not limited to the school. 戊. The subjects attached to vocational supplementary schools at all levels should, in addition to being of the same nature as the schools, also pay close attention to the needs of the local area. The attached subjects, such as agricultural vocational schools and rural normal schools, should run agronomy, animal husbandry, cooperation, and other subjects. Vocational and girls' secondary normal schools should run home economics, childcare, sewing, and domestic helper subjects. 己. The surplus of vocational supplementary schools and vocational training classes should all comply with the provisions of the regulations on vocational supplementary schools and the interim measures for short-term vocational training classes promulgated by the Ministry.
3.  Regarding the teachers of vocational supplementary schools, 甲. In addition to the teachers designated by the school to teach, the vocational supplementary schools or vocational training classes attached to schools at all levels can also select high-grade students with excellent grades to assist in teaching. When necessary, technical personnel and artists from various industries may be hired to teach. 乙. The teaching subjects of vocational supplementary schools and vocational training classes should be in accordance with the regulations of vocational supplementary schools and the interim measures for short-term vocational training classes promulgated by the Ministry.
4.  Regarding the funding of vocational supplementary schools, 甲. The funding for vocational supplementary schools or vocational training classes run by schools at all levels should be based on the principle of saving expenses from the original budget. The expenses for practical materials and hiring full-time teachers may be requested from the competent authorities for subsidies when necessary. The funding for vocational supplementary schools or vocational training classes run by vocational groups should be raised by the groups themselves. If the operation is successful, they may apply to the competent authorities for appropriate subsidies. 5. Regarding the implementation steps of vocational supplementary schools, 甲. All provinces and cities should first select appropriate schools in the prosperous industrial and commercial areas of the provinces and cities to run vocational supplementary schools or vocational training classes. After they are successful, they should gradually expand and establish them. 乙. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, all vocational schools, rural normal schools, and vocational groups in various specialized schools and above, except for those that have been approved to postpone by the competent educational administrative organs due to special circumstances, should be held. 丙. All provinces and cities should register and assess technicians in various industries and, when necessary, concentrate them for short-term training to determine the preparation of teachers for vocational supplementary schools.

### A Glimpse of the Achievements of the National Economic Council's Cotton Control Commission Since its Establishment

Promote Cotton Production and Improve Quality, Strive to Export and Save Imports

The National Economic Council's Cotton Control Commission has been established for three years. Its mission is to promote cotton production and improve quality, not only to achieve self-sufficiency but also to strive for exports to save imports and develop the national economy. Last year, my country's cotton harvest increased significantly, which is the result of the commission's three years of hard work. Other efforts, such as textile experiments, are also in progress. The details are described as follows:

Main Work

The main work of the Cotton Control Commission is to promote cotton fields and improve quality. Therefore, the Central Cotton Production Improvement Institute was first established, and a cotton farm was set up in Xiaolingwei, Nanjing, to engage in fine-staple upland cotton and German-American cotton breeding and various research work. A breeding and propagation farm was attached to Dongtai to plant Golden American cotton. Subsequently, cotton production improvement institutes were established in Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hebei, Shanxi, and other provinces, with thirteen cotton farms attached to cultivate Sizi, Tuozi, Dezi, and Jinzi American cotton and Lingbao cotton for breeding and propagation to meet the needs of promotion. In the past few years, the number of acres of American cotton promoted in Jiangsu, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hubei, Hebei, Gansu, and other provinces totaled 570,200 mu in the 23rd year, 1,288,454 mu in the 24th year, and 2,676,025 mu in the 25th year. Among them, Shaanxi Province accounted for the largest number of acres. After the strict implementation of the prohibition of opium cultivation, changing to cotton cultivation was the most suitable crop, so the increase in cotton fields was particularly rapid. Jiangsu Province promoted American cotton the earliest, reaching 300,000 mu in the 23rd year and 600,000 mu in the 25th year, an increase of one time. Henan and Shanxi provinces increased by about ten times. Other provinces have gradually promoted it after the establishment of the provincial improvement institutes, and the number is also very large.

Organize Cooperatives

In order to facilitate promotion, the association guided farmers in various provinces to organize cooperatives. In Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Henan, Shanxi, and Hebei provinces, there were a total of 40 cooperatives in the 23rd year, with a total of 23,444 members and a total of 308,685 mu of cotton fields. In the 24th year, it increased to 75 cooperatives, with a total of 53,059 members and 856,668 mu of cotton fields. Last year, there were not many changes in Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Henan, and Shanxi provinces. Hebei Province added nearly 700 cooperatives, and Hubei Province newly organized about 190 cooperatives. The two provinces added about 50,000 members and about 500,000 mu of cotton fields. The cooperative loans are provided by the China Agricultural Cooperative Loan Syndicate organized by the banking community in this city. The total amount of loans in the past three years is about 4 million yuan. To facilitate the sale of cotton by various cooperatives, the association has established a cotton transportation and sales office in Shanghai. In the past three years, it has handled the sale of about 100,000 dan of cotton.

Improve Cotton Spinning

In order to study and improve the cotton spinning industry, there has long been a proposal to establish a cotton industry experiment hall. At that time, the National Central Research Institute also had a plan to set up a textile experiment factory. After consultation, it was decided to jointly establish it. A certain area was designated in the south of the Institute of Science and Technology of the Central Research Institute in Shanghai, and construction began at the end of the 23rd year. The total budget was 1.2 million yuan in national currency, divided into three phases. The initial equipment cost was 400,000 yuan, the base construction cost was 160,000 yuan, and the construction and equipment cost was 240,000 yuan. By July of the 25th year, the factory buildings were built, and the textile machines were selected and purchased from various countries, including 31 units for the spinning department, such as various cleaning, combing, fine combing, roving, and spinning machines, and 71 units for the weaving department, such as various winding, jacquard, and fabric finishing machines. They were also installed and tested one after another at this time. At first, 42-count double-strand yarn was spun and ordinary fine cloth was woven. Now, 50-60 count yarn is being spun and various fine products such as straight tribute flannel and jacquard are being woven. The experiment department is equipped with various cotton fiber testing machines, yarn count measuring scales, temperature measuring scales, cotton yarn and cotton cloth strength and elongation testing machines, and more than 70 fabric bursting, ventilation, waterproof shrinkage, and length dyeing fastness instruments, mainly to test the products of each department of the hall. Many people outside also said that they wanted to request analysis and inspection.

### The Elevation of the Status of the Chinese and Belgian Envoys Will Be Realized This Autumn

Jules D'Anethan Will No Longer Return to His Post

According to sources in diplomatic circles here, the relationship between China and Belgium has become increasingly close in recent years. The authorities of the two countries are currently proceeding with the elevation of the status of their envoys to each other. Before his vacation back to his country last year, Jules D'Anethan, the Belgian Minister to China, had several consultations with the authorities of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and both parties expressed their approval. However, after the status of the envoys is elevated, all light expenses will inevitably increase accordingly, so it must be approved by the central meetings of both countries before it can be realized. Minister D'Anethan has reported the results of his several consultations with our Ministry to the Belgian authorities after returning to his country. It is expected that it can be realized this autumn. After Minister D'Anethan returned to his country, he has been transferred to an internal position and it has been decided that he will no longer come to China.

### The Taxpayers' Association Sent a Letter Requesting the Municipal Council to Curb the Increase in Water Prices

The Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating, "Dear Sirs, approved the joint letter from the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, the Shanghai Farmers' Association, the Shanghai General Labor Union, the Shanghai Women's Association, the Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association, the Shanghai Tenants' Association, the Chinese National Products Manufacturers' Federation, and the Shanghai Citizens' National Products Consumption Association, stating that since the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company changed the water fee from a 25% discount to a 20% discount on February 1 of this year, which is an increase in debt, all users have strongly opposed it due to the increase in burden. On January 30, a joint meeting of representatives of various groups was held, and it was generally believed that tap water is a drink for all residents, and this public utility should aim at public welfare. In recent years, Shanghai has been affected by the January 28 Incident, and industry and commerce have been depressed, and vacant houses are lined up. Residents have launched a rent reduction movement to maintain the status quo. However, the Shanghai Waterworks Company, disregarding the difficulties of the times, suddenly took advantage of the low exchange rate at this time to deceive the Municipal Council into changing the discount and implementing the increase in tariffs. It has been decided to strongly negotiate with the municipal government and request the Taxpayers' Association to argue on the basis of reason in the case. Correspondingly, the letter stated that your association should quickly strive for the Municipal Council to achieve the purpose of canceling the price increase to maintain the market. In this time of general decline in social economy, and at a time when the world is seeking stability, fair agencies should have extraordinary rulings on actions that sacrifice the public and seek self-interest, in order to comply with public opinion and avoid accumulating resentment. The letter is approved for the above reasons, and a corresponding letter is hereby sent, hoping that you will take note and comply with public opinion."

### Prelude to Planting Cotton on Hainan Island

Representatives from the National Economic Council, etc., Are Scheduled to Depart on the 11th

According to the Shin Zu News Agency, the plan to develop cotton planting on Hainan Island was initially proposed by Rong Zongjing, a giant in the yarn industry, to the National Cotton Production Improvement Association. After the association passed it, it negotiated with the National Economic Council to be responsible for its promotion. The association also believed that the development of cotton planting on Hainan Island was of great importance to the future of China's production. Therefore, the association ordered the Cotton Control Commission to plan and implement it. The Cotton Control Commission immediately decided that the first step was to investigate the actual situation of the area, and then formulate a detailed cultivation plan based on the results of the investigation for implementation. It has now been decided that the National Economic Council, the Agricultural College of Central University, and the United Association of Chinese Yarn Factories will each send personnel to form an inspection team to go to investigate together. In addition to Guo Shun of the United Association of Yarn Factories, who has already set off for Hong Kong the day before, Feng Zefang, director of the Central Cotton Adulteration and Mixing Prohibition Office, representing the National Economic Council, and Yu Qibao, representing the Agricultural College of Central University, are scheduled to travel to Hong Kong on the Empress of Asia on the 11th of this month, and then gather with other representatives in Hong Kong to go to Hainan Island for survey.

### Chinese Employees of Foreign Firms Voluntarily Pay Income Tax

Wang Huaiding's Patriotic Enthusiasm

Since the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance's Income Tax Office began collecting income tax, people from all walks of life have been flocking to the office to inquire. In order to facilitate taxpayers' understanding of tax payment procedures, the office has set up an inquiry office and assigned personnel to be responsible for handling it. In recent days, in addition to the majority of domestic business and industrial circles, many overseas Chinese merchants have also sent personnel to contact everything and inquire about various tax payment situations. Among the overseas Chinese merchants, such as Ahu Man, Davis, Ke Baoluo, and lawyers from the United States, the American Jibei Foreign Firm, the American Yihua Foreign Firm, the British Baohong Insurance Company, the Swedish Liannuo Foreign Firm, the German Yuxing Foreign Firm, and the American Baptist Publishing House, the Chinese staff of the French Dali Accounting Firm Ding Kangzhen and others have voluntarily paid income tax to the office. Wang Huaiding, a Chinese employee who works for overseas Chinese merchants, claimed to be a foreman in a certain foreign firm, with a monthly salary of 25 yuan, and a total of about 130-140 yuan including extra income, and asked the office to indicate the tax payable.

### China-Philippines Air Route to be Realized Soon

China-Siam Air Route is also Under Negotiation

According to the Central News Agency, a large number of people from Guangdong and Fujian provinces in our country reside in various parts of Southeast Asia and Siam to do business. In the past, they all took foreign ships for round trips, and the annual leakage was huge. Overseas Chinese are eager to serve their country, so people from all over have suggested to the government to open international air routes, which has been ordered by the Ministry of Communications to be handled by the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. It is heard that a decision has been made, and the newly built Hai Ting ship will sail between Xiamen and the Philippines. The ship is now sailing between Shanghai and Guangdong. After returning to Shanghai for inspection and repair, it will sail to Xiamen for its maiden voyage around the end of this month. There will be one flight per week thereafter, and the journey will take about one day and one night.

China-Siam Air Route is Under Negotiation

There are also many overseas Chinese in Siam who travel back and forth every year, so they have also requested that Chinese ships sail to the area. Xu Ge Ting, an executive committee member of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Siam, returned to China a few days ago. He also contacted the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company about opening the China-Siam air route. Xu has been very busy with social engagements in recent days and has also contacted domestic goods manufacturers to negotiate the sale of domestic products in Siam. Because it has come to an end, he was accompanied by Wang Zhihua to Beijing by the Capital Express this morning. Jiang met with Changzhou and asked for the establishment of the Sino-Siamese Association and the opening of the China-Siam air route as soon as possible. After staying for a while, he will return to Shanghai.

Siamese Side Proposes Joint Venture in Shipping Industry

Our country organized and dispatched an inspection group to Siam a few years ago. The inspection in Siam was warmly received by the local overseas Chinese and the local government. There were sincere discussions on the development of commerce between the two countries. It is heard that the Siamese government proposed to jointly establish a China-Siam shipping company at that time. The plan was quite detailed, with a capital of 4 million yuan, half from China and half from Siam. Other details, such as routes and ship tonnage, were carefully planned. At that time, our inspection group agreed very much, but because it needed to be approved by the government, it promised to study and decide in detail after returning to China. However, the Siamese government has paid much attention to this matter, so it has sent Willie Bei, the commercial commissioner in Hong Kong, to contact our authorities through Xiaofocheng Zisongqin. It is heard that the government is considering it and will soon become a reality.

### Martyr Qian Digeng to be Publicly Buried in Wujiang

Martyr Qian Digeng was involved in the revolution and had significant meritorious service. He died righteously in Shanghai in the 16th year of the Republic of China. After proposals by Li Liejun, Ju Zheng, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Qun, and others, and approved by the 35th Central Standing Committee meeting, he was permitted to be publicly buried to comfort his heroic spirit. Martyr Qian was from Wujiang, Jiangsu. His coffin is temporarily placed in Wujiang. According to Jin Luwang, director of the Martyr Public Burial Preparatory Committee, who is in Shanghai from Jiangsu, he is contacting various sectors regarding the public burial. The location will be in Wujiang. Once negotiations are complete, all matters can proceed. Now, a brief biography of the martyr is recorded as follows: Martyr Qian Digeng, named Gang, was from Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province. He was forthright, magnanimous, and had lofty ambitions. He studied at the Jiangxi Standing Army Training Camp and later transferred to the Army Military Police School until graduation. In the winter of the 15th year of the Republic of China, our army confronted the rebel Sun in Jiangxi. The martyr plotted an uprising in Shanghai. Before it could be completed, he was captured by the rebel general Li Baozhang on January 16th and faced death unyieldingly. The martyr had revolutionary aspirations from a young age. In the 31st year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, when Hu Ganchen and Liao Bolang returned from Japan, he was introduced to the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance). In October of the Xinhai year, when the banner of righteousness was raised, the martyr responded to the uprising in Jiangxi and went with Li Liejun to Hubei to form the Northern Expeditionary Army. After the Yangtze River was pacified, he reunited with comrades and welcomed Li back to Jiangxi to manage military and civilian affairs. During the Second Revolution, he was in charge of the military law office of the Jiangxi Governor's Office, exerting great effort. After the failure of the campaign against Yuan Shikai, he fled to Japan. In the sixth year of the Republic, he was ordered to welcome members of the extraordinary National Assembly to Guangzhou. In the eleventh year, he served as aide-de-camp of the Grand Marshal's Office and commander of the Zengcheng Garrison. He then returned to his hometown due to illness. In the thirteenth year, he served as a councilor of the Second National Army. In July of the fourteenth year, he went to the Eastern Expeditionary Army Headquarters as the director of intelligence and was transferred to be an adjutant at the Huangpu Military Academy. With the rise of the Northern Expeditionary Army, he went to Shanghai and died righteously. He was forty years old. The day after his death, his wife, Ms. Liu, prepared a coffin and mourned his death. His head was severed, but his face remained lifelike, which was praised by all who heard of it. His elder brother, Shu Fen, and younger brother, He, are both ambitious. His son, Kangmin, is already of age and will surely carry on his father's legacy.

### Smuggling and Drug Trafficking in North China Remain Rampant

According to a translated report from the Mainland News Agency, Dr. Wu Liande, director of the Customs Epidemic Prevention Department, recently conducted a ten-day inspection in the areas of Tianjin, Tanggu, and Qinhuangdao. After returning to Shanghai, he told people that Korean and Japanese ruffians are still very active in the private trafficking of drugs in North China, which is deeply painful due to the mental and physical harm caused to the ignorant people. Dr. Wu, a world-renowned public health expert, reportedly received reports from relevant parties that the drug traffickers in North China have organized a large-scale smuggling organization. Along the Jinpu Railway line to the north, drug-addicted farmers, shop assistants, and people from middle and upper classes can be seen everywhere. Their bodies are deeply sunken, their shoulders are raised high, and their faces are bloodless. The severity of the drug harm can be imagined. According to reports from customs epidemic prevention sub-bureaus in various places, Korean and Japanese drug traffickers smuggle large quantities of various drugs from Shenyang to Tianjin every day. They enjoy freedom of movement due to special forces. After arriving in Tianjin, they sell the drugs to farmers and shop assistants at low prices. After being disarmed, customs inspectors are often subjected to violent acts by ruffians, making it impossible for them to perform their duties. The smuggling of drugs is now gradually spreading southward from the northern end of the Jinpu Railway line. Various drugs are priced low, and drug traffickers use sweet words and persuasive tactics to promote sales, and quite a few people fall into their trap, especially young and ignorant teenagers. The main factories for manufacturing these drugs are located in Shenyang, Dalian, and Harbin, with Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan serving as distribution and wholesale hubs. Passengers on the Beining Railway can purchase and consume drugs from smugglers at any time in the train, because there are many drug traffickers, and the illegal protection from certain parties makes it impossible for the customs to investigate. In addition to the railway line, drug traffickers also use highways to smuggle drugs from Shenyang to various places in North China. Drug traffickers know that customs officers are powerless, so they have become increasingly rampant. Dr. Wu also stated that the smuggling in North China has not been stopped, and the customs losses have reached 53 million yuan per year.

### News After the Cessation of Operations of the Inland Navigation Steamship Company

It has been reported that after the Inland Navigation Steamship Company was ordered to cease operations, employees of various shipping routes sent representatives to petition the Party and government authorities in this city. According to the person in charge of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, after the company took over the Inland Navigation Steamship Company, its business was not very developed, resulting in significant losses. Last year, most of the steamships were leased to local shipping merchants operating on various routes, but the results were still not good. After the reorganization of the company, it repeatedly received orders from the Ministry to end the operation of the Inland Navigation Steamship Company, and it was decided to cease operations at the end of the 25th year. At that time, because the various procedures had not been completed, the Ministry approved an extension to cease operations on January 15th of this year. Regarding the agreement with Zhang Yi, the outside world does not understand the truth and there are many misunderstandings. When the Inland Navigation Steamship Company was processing its closure, a merchant named Zhang Yi contacted the Inland Navigation Steamship Company to lease steamships and docks, but it was stopped due to an event, and it was not realized. This is what happened. As for the Ministry of Transportation's decision to close down the Inland Navigation Steamship Company, it was mainly because the company was a business with additional operations. The company had already incurred losses after it took over, and it was inconvenient to maintain it. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company should focus on expanding the Yangtze River and ocean business and provide private shipping merchants with opportunities for development on inland navigation routes. In addition, it was heard that the Inland Navigation Steamship Company did sign a draft lease agreement with Zhang Yi for the lease of steamships and docks, but it was stipulated that the draft agreement would be invalid if approval was not granted within half a month after consultation. The statement that "the contract specifies that the entire handover will be handled on January 16th of the 26th year" is not factual.

### Chamber of Commerce Sends Letters to Four Major Companies Urging the Use of the New System of Weights and Measures

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent letters to Yong'an, Sincere, New World, and Great World yesterday, stating, "Dear Sirs, In the instruction No. 2266 from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau on the 4th of this month, it is stated that the Biscuit, Candy, Canned Food, and Bread Trade Association of this city reported that most of its members reported that since the association unified the use of the new counter scales last summer, there have been no inconveniences in calculating transactions with each other. There are some non-member colleagues who are reluctant to change, but once they are guided, they will follow suit. However, the four major department stores standing on Nanjing Road, such as Yong'an, Sincere, New World, and Great World, use yards for measurement and pounds for weight, relying on the special areas of the concessions, and seem to be unaware of government regulations. Members reported that calculations are inconvenient and cause losses. After repeated negotiations, they have been ineffective. According to the investigation, there is a 10% difference between pounds and catties. If you want to trade with them, you must suffer this tasteless exploitation. Because of their large sales volume, you have to reluctantly endure it. This not only violates administrative regulations but also disrupts the market. After a meeting to review the situation, it was decided to report to the responsible officials and strictly ban it to achieve uniform standards and eliminate abnormalities forever. It is requested that your bureau order the immediate change to maintain consistency and facilitate transactions. According to the investigation, the new system of weights and measures has been in effect in this city for many years, and the companies should comply with it. According to the previous report, it is ordered that you transfer the order to the companies to comply with the immediate change to the new system and do not delay. It is very important to report the handling situation. In order to unify the weights and measures, it is concerned with the national regulations, and all merchants should not be unique. Moreover, your company has a large scale, and all its actions are admired by the whole city. In response to the previous orders, we write to urge you to look into the matters set forth in the order, immediately change to the new system of weights and measures, and it is our hope that you will report the handling situation."

The workers expressed satisfaction with the company's acceptance of the workers' demands and decided to wait for a solution.

### Robber Shot Dead in Dongxi Huade Road After Struggling with Police

Female Servant Deftly Stops Robbers, Owner Suffers No Loss Two Robbers Escape, Two Pedestrians Hit by Stray Bullets

Chen Xiaoyu, 46 years old, from Shaoxing, lives at No. 105, No. 573 Lane, Dongxi Huade Road (i.e., Baohua Lane). At about 8 o'clock yesterday morning, while Chen was still sound asleep, three men suddenly approached Chen's house and knocked on the back door, each holding a bag of peanuts and persimmons, appearing as if they were delivering gifts. At that time, Chen's female servant, Chen Fang, was washing in the kitchen. She suddenly heard a knock on the door and immediately opened it to investigate. Unexpectedly, the three men

Pulled Out Pistols

Warned her not to make a sound, and stepped into the house. Chen Fang, realizing that she had encountered robbers, was not flustered at all. Catching the robbers off guard, she immediately slapped the pistol held by the leading robber in his hand onto the ground, knocking it off and onto the stone steps. She then took the opportunity to push the robber out of the door and ran to the front door, shouting "Catch the robbers!" The robbers, seeing that things were not going well, hurriedly picked up their pistols and fled backwards. At that time, two plainclothes detectives, No. 611 and No. 731, from the Huishan Police Station, were

In a Small Teahouse

Near the Xinji Bang Road, sipping tea. Hearing the alarm, they rushed over. Thus, both sides opened fire, and bullets rained down like a storm, with sounds like continuous pearls. The robbers fled while firing, and the detectives chased closely. By the time they reached the intersection of Dongyouheng Road and Yuanfang Road, the police officer at post No. 2995 also joined the chase. One of the robbers was shot more than a dozen times and fell in front of the Lester Institute of Engineering, and threw his pistol into the wall of the school. The other two robbers escaped in the chaos. The detectives then

Checked the Fallen Robber

Beside him, but he had been dead for a long time. They found a wallet in his pocket, containing 5 yuan in legal tender, and two business cards. The detectives immediately telegraphed the police station and sent a vehicle to transport the robber's body to the mortuary for examination. In addition, it was found that during the fierce battle between the detectives and the robbers, two pedestrians were injured by stray bullets near Yuanfang Road. One was Zhao Wenhua, 24 years old, from Ningbo, who lived at No. 90 Deyu Lane, Dongyouheng Road, and worked as a small worker in an iron factory.

Bullet Hit the Lower Abdomen

The other was Yu Ajin, 36 years old, from Ningbo, who lived in Zhabei and worked as a vendor. His leg bone was hit by a bullet. Both were hired vehicles to be sent to the hospital for treatment, but Zhao Wenhua's situation was more serious and very critical. The Huishan Police Station summoned the female servant Chen Fang to the police station after the incident to commend her. They deeply praised her brave actions and will praise and reward her.

Westerner Acts Bravely

According to the Municipal Council, at 9:00 AM yesterday, Mr. Foyin, Assistant Inspector of the Donation Tax Section of the Finance Department of the Municipal Council, was passing through Xihua Road on official business when he suddenly encountered a robber with a pistol running towards him. Two plainclothes Chinese police officers blew their whistles and chased him from behind. Mr. Foyin hid behind a lamppost and drew his pistol (the Municipal Council collectors carried pistols to protect themselves or assist police officers in the event of an accident). He took the opportunity to fire a shot and hit the thug. The thug staggered and fled, and fired back. Mr. Foyin and the Chinese police bravely chased him. Another Chinese policeman also rushed to the scene and fired three more shots, finally killing the thug. The thug had colluded with four other robbers to rob a store on Xinji Bang Road, so he fled. Mr. Foyin bravely opened fire and was alert and quick, which is highly commendable.

### Renewed Hearing Yesterday for the Case of the Assassination of Tang Youqian

The judge painstakingly sought details, repeatedly questioning the defendants.

Former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tang Youyu, a native of Xiang, was assassinated on the evening of December 25, 1935, in front of his private residence, Gan Village, on Rue Ganston in the French Concession. After the Shanghai authorities offered a reward for the capture of the culprit, the former Public Security Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government apprehended Liu Zhennan, a native of Hubei, at 26 Rue Robert in the Siamese Concession. The Public Security Bureau also apprehended Qiu Jiyu, a bandit, and learned that he was also a principal culprit in the murder of Tang. The French police then transferred Liu and Qiu to the Special Second Court for interrogation and investigation. After a long period, the investigation was completed. The lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Police filed a public prosecution against them for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. Former Criminal Division Chief Wang Gangxu and Judge Chen Daqi repeatedly held court hearings, but the case remained unresolved. The two defendants had confessed to firing the shots that killed Tang. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Gong Kun, the Criminal Division Chief of the Special Second Court, presided over a renewed hearing in the First Tribunal. The lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Police, Fei Xizhen, presented the case and the articles of indictment. The court then ordered the two defendants to be interrogated separately. First, Liu Zhennan was questioned, but he suddenly recanted his confession, denying involvement in the murder. Qiu also recanted his confession. The prosecuting officer then reported that Tang Weishu, the sister of the deceased Tang Youren, had intended to testify in court today, but was unable to obtain leave from her position as a clerk in the Special First Court. Only the female servant, Zheng Li, testified. Li testified that she only heard several gunshots and then came down from the fourth floor, only to see that her employer had fallen near the second floor. She did not see the person who fired the shots and knew nothing else. Presiding Judge Liao painstakingly sought details, repeatedly questioning the two defendants for a long time. He then decided to reschedule the hearing after further investigation. The defendants were returned to custody.

### Quarrel Over Meager Dowry During a Visit to Relatives Leads to a Fight

The parties even resort to litigation.

Chen Genfa, a 19-year-old native of Ningbo who works as a compradore, residing at 24 Caojiazhai, Connaught Road, in the British Concession, married Gui Juan, the daughter of Wang Pan, a fellow countrywoman working as a domestic servant in the residence of the Italian Vice Consul, Ma Weili, at 1 Lane 1, 2001 Avenue Joffre, in the French Concession, through a matchmaker on September 24, 1935. After the wedding, they became estranged due to dissatisfaction with the bride's dowry, leading to frequent disputes. On the night of the 27th of last month, Chen Baolin and his daughter-in-law, Wang Gui Juan, quarreled again. Chen then confined his daughter-in-law in her room, forbidding her to leave. The next day, Gui Juan wrote a letter and threw it out of the window, asking a passerby to deliver it to her mother, Wang Pan, informing her of her confinement. On the night of the 29th, Wang Pan took her daughter, Gui Juan, back to her home. On the night of the 30th, at around 9:00 PM, Chen Baolin, along with his wife and son, Chen Genfa, went to Wang Pan's room, Room 1, 2002 Avenue Joffre, to demand that Gui Juan return home. This led to another argument between the young couple, the in-laws, and the parents, which escalated into a physical fight. Bystanders were unable to stop them. Pan's employer, the Italian Vice Consul, called the French police on duty, who sent detectives to the scene. Chen and his family had already fled home. Afterwards, Wang Pan inspected her room and found that fifty yuan in banknotes were missing. Feeling aggrieved that she and her daughter had been injured, she reported the incident to the French police, accusing her in-laws, Chen Baolin and Chen Genfa, of assault and theft. Yesterday, Chen Baolin was apprehended and sent to the Special Second Court, requesting a rescheduling of the investigation. Judge Qiu presided over the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court.

After the police lawyer presented the case, Wang Gui Juan testified that since her marriage, her parents-in-law and husband had been unhappy with her dowry, leading to discord. However, her father-in-law had treated her well, but unexpectedly attempted indecent behavior. On the night of the 27th of last month, her father-in-law came to her room and tried to misbehave. She refused and scolded him, and he then beat her and locked her in the room. She now had injuries to her head and face, and requested an investigation. When Chen Baolin was questioned, he denied the assault. He said that the young couple had quarreled. The court reviewed the testimonies and decided to reschedule the hearing to the 11th. The defendant was released on bail.

### Death from Pufferfish Poisoning

A Jiangbei boat was moored in the Lujiabang area of the South City, carrying an elderly couple and their young son, whose names were not known. It was only known that their son was named Fan Ronghua, 13 years old, from Huaiyang. Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, Ronghua found two pufferfish on the shore nearby. He then took them back to the boat and cooked them with his parents. Shortly after, they were poisoned and suffered severe abdominal pain. The sound of their groaning alerted neighboring boats, who went to investigate and found the three of them rolling around in the cabin. After questioning, it was discovered that they had eaten pufferfish and been poisoned. The incident was immediately reported to the nearby police station, who summoned ambulances from the West District Fire Brigade to the scene. However, the elderly couple had already succumbed to the poisoning and died. Their son, Ronghua, was taken to Shanghai Hospital for treatment.

The bandits, seeing that they had caused trouble, did not rob anything and fled. Afterwards, the shop owner reported the incident to the local police station and sent his son, Gensheng, to Renji Hospital for treatment.

### Female Singer Accuses Jiang Boying of Obscenity

Jiang fails to appear, hearing postponed.

Jiang Boying, the Shanghai-native manager of the Continental Trading Company at 851 Peking Road, has recently been accused of obscenity in the Special First Court by Lai Ling (also known as Shu Ming), a famous female singer from Fuzhou. The case stems from the fact that Lai joined the Star Technical Song and Dance Troupe organized by Jiang several years ago and went abroad to perform. On the way back to China, Jiang raped her, leading to the lawsuit. The Special First Court had previously summoned him for questioning, as reported by this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Xiefen held a continued hearing in the First Criminal Court. The defendant, Jiang Boying, did not appear. His wife, Fan Qiongyu,委托委托吴正矱，凤昔醉律师到庭, stating that Jiang had gone to the capital on the 25th of last month and had been entrusted by the Capital World Theater on the 4th of this month to invite performers from Peiping, so he could not appear in court. She requested that a longer period be granted for him to appear in court. The court then questioned Lai Ling about the organization of the Star Technical Song and Dance Troupe. The hearing was then adjourned until the 19th. It is reported that Lai Ling will also be going to Wuhan tomorrow with a certain song and dance troupe to perform.

### Wu Baoqian Sentenced to Life Imprisonment for Joint Drug Trafficking

Sun Shaokun, a Chinese detective at the Customs Police Station, learned that a Korean man named Xiao Jin was selling heroin for profit at 45, Lane 70, Huaji Road, and was living quite well. He reported this to the police chief, and together with a Western detective and a Japanese consulate detective, obtained a search warrant from the First Special District Court. They secretly went to the address at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday to arrest Xiao Jin, who had already fled after hearing the news. They arrested Wu Baoqian, a Shandong native, who was an accomplice, along with 116 packs of heroin, a one-dime note, sixty one-fen copper coins, and 136 ten-wen copper coins. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, filed a public prosecution under Article 9, Paragraph 1 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Drug Crimes, requesting a strict investigation. Sun, the detective, then reported the process of solving the case and presented the evidence. When questioned, the defendant claimed that he was not working with the Korean man. He said that a friend surnamed Liu had asked him to buy a small pack of heroin on his behalf, and he had been mistakenly arrested. The rest of his testimony was evasive. Judge Zhong Qing ruled that the evidence was sufficient and that there was no room for cunning excuses. He sentenced Wu Baoqian to life imprisonment for jointly selling drugs, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. The evidence was confiscated according to regulations.

### Pi Sha'er Stabs Huang Kongshi Eighteen Times

Huang Jinwen, 28 years old, a native of Henan, lived in a thatched hut in the Old Camp of Gaochang Temple in South Shanghai. His wife, Huang Kongshi, was from the same hometown and of the same age. Unexpectedly, at 6:00 PM the night before last, a friend named Pi Sha'er from their hometown came to visit. When Huang Kongshi saw that her husband had a friend visiting, she took a teapot and went out to get tea at the tiger stove. Unexpectedly, Pi followed her to the tiger stove and said to Kongshi, "My wife has been missing for eight months. Do you know anything about it?" Kongshi replied that she did not know his wife and had no idea where she had gone. Pi then, without asking any further questions, pulled out a sharp knife and stabbed Kongshi eighteen times: one stab to the forehead, one to the right cheek, one behind the left ear, one to the right rib, one to the back, one to the right shoulder, five to the left arm, one to the left thumb, and one to the little finger. She was covered in blood and fell to the ground in agony. A police officer arrived on the scene, but the assailant had already fled. The injured woman was taken to Bethel Hospital for treatment. According to Dr. Mei, the knife wound to the forehead was quite severe and her life was in danger. The police station, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched detective He Wenjin to investigate the cause and arrest the assailant for legal proceedings.

### Rickshaw Owners and Pullers Hold Separate Meetings to Protest Reduction in Rickshaws

After the Public Works Department of the Public Concession decided to reduce the number of rickshaws through a lottery on February 20th, rickshaw owners and pullers held separate meetings to protest. Details are as follows:

Joint Meeting

After the Public Works Department decided to reduce the number of public rickshaws in the concession, it was resolved that 484 rickshaws would be reduced through a lottery on the 20th, leaving 9,500 rickshaws. The owners had repeatedly opposed this decision through their association, but to no avail. The Special District Rickshaw Association held a joint meeting of representatives from the five districts at 4:00 PM yesterday, attended by over a hundred people, including Yin Zhiling, Hou Shaoan, Yuan Songmao, Wang Kunyi, Zheng Jianquan, and Bao Zhenhuang. Yin Zhiling chaired the meeting. As a result of the discussion, they unanimously opposed the Public Works Department's move and made a false resolution to seek assistance from all parties. This false resolution will be submitted to the general meeting of rickshaw owners for discussion. At the same time, the association notified all rickshaw owners to attend the general meeting of rickshaw owners at the City Chamber of Commerce at 9:00 AM on the 9th of this month to discuss countermeasures. According to the person in charge of the association, who spoke to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency, in the past year, the Public Works Department had ordered wage cuts and forced them to pay a license fee of 1.5 yuan in January of this year. Now, they want to reduce the number of rickshaws. These rickshaws are licensed in three areas, and the Public Works Bureau and the Public Concession Bureau are following suit. Is this not forcing the rickshaw industry into bankruptcy? Therefore, the industry believes that the Public Works Department's move is not justified. At the same time, for the sake of livelihood, they are determined to oppose it to the death.

Rickshaw Pullers' Meeting

On the rickshaw pullers' side, a general meeting of representatives from the five districts was held yesterday morning, attended by fifty people. Chen Guoliang was elected chairman. The chairman first reported that if the Public Works Department reduced the number of rickshaws, it would inevitably lead to an increase of 1,734 unemployed rickshaw pullers. Including family members, the number would be over 6,604, cutting off their livelihoods, which is contrary to the principle of rescuing rickshaw pullers. After discussion, it was resolved that: (1) they would protest according to law, requesting the Public Works Department to withdraw its order; (2) if the goal was not achieved, they would take effective measures to cope with it. Then, they discussed the Public Works Department's arbitrary punishment cases and resolved to oppose the requirement of carrying a raincoat on sunny days. In addition, due to the severe weather, business was slack, and most rickshaw pullers had nothing to protect themselves from the cold, even freezing to death, starving to death, or committing suicide. However, the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association was monopolized, collecting a huge sum of 15,000 yuan per month, totaling 480,000 yuan, with no adequate relief for the poor rickshaw pullers. It was resolved to ask the chairman to follow the previous year's method and, together with legal counsel Wu Kaisheng, find ways to solicit donations of cotton clothes and white rice to distribute to the poor rickshaw pullers to help them get through the Lunar New Year. According to Chen Guoliang, a representative of the rickshaw pullers, since the Public Works Department registered rickshaw pullers, more than 40,000 rickshaw pullers have become unemployed. Now, they want to reduce the number of rickshaws by 484, and thousands of rickshaw pullers will become unemployed because they have no rickshaws to pull. Moreover, the Public Works Department not only does not restrict electric trams, buses, private rickshaws, and taxis in the concession, but is increasing their number day by day. If the Public Works Department wants to think about the public, it should expand the number of rickshaws to maintain the livelihoods of unemployed rickshaw pullers and facilitate the travel of people in the lower classes. Otherwise, it should reduce them equally. Furthermore, according to the new regulations of the bureau, public rickshaws must carry a raincoat on sunny days, otherwise they will be arbitrarily detained and punished. In recent years, theft incidents have occurred repeatedly. Once stolen, would this not increase the burden of compensation for poor rickshaw pullers? In short, the Public Works Department's move is completely unreasonable and disregards the overall situation.

### Yesterday's Conversation Between Public Works Department and Reporters

Postponement of Lottery for Rickshaw Reduction; Rickshaw Industry Can Express Opinions for Reference

Yesterday, the Public Works Department invited reporters to discuss the postponement of the lottery method for reducing rickshaws. According to reports, the board of directors of the Public Works Department had previously resolved to reduce the number of public rickshaws by 500 from March 1 of this year. The bureau had announced this in September of last year and handed it over to the bureau's Rickshaw Special Committee to consider the implementation methods of this resolution. The committee had sent a letter to the Rickshaw Industry Association, asking them to express their opinions on the most fair method they believed was available for reference. The association replied that it was unwilling to express its opinions unless the Public Works Department fully explained the reasons and intentions for reducing the number of rickshaws. The Rickshaw Special Committee of the Public Works Department believed that the board of directors of the Public Works Department could handle the matter at its own discretion and submitted three suggestions to the board of directors. The board of directors resolved at a meeting on February 3 to hold a lottery on February 13. Yesterday, the Rickshaw Industry Association sent representatives to the Public Works Department to request a postponement of the lottery, citing the imminent Lunar New Year. Therefore, the board of directors of the Public Works Department approved the postponement to February 20. During this postponement period, the Rickshaw Industry Association may still express its opinions for reference.

### Yunfei Car Company Leases Empty Bund

A site on the Bund, previously tendered by the Public Works Department for use as a parking area for rental cars, has reportedly been won by Yunfei Car Company for a monthly rent of 200 national currency.

### Kuai Shitai Sues for Inheritance

Shi Feng's mother is an English woman, suing in court as an agent.

Kuai Shitai, a native of Hefei, Anhui, residing at No. 12, Lane 314, Hardoon Road, Shanghai, is involved in a lawsuit with his family in the First Special District Court over an inheritance dispute. Kuai Shitai's grandmother, nee Li, had three sons: Xiaoxian, Shouhian, and Xiuxian, and one daughter, Shuping, who was the principal of Peicheng Girls' School. Xiuxian married a Scottish woman named Huibo in England and had a son, Shitai, in 1919. He is now seventeen years old. Xiuxian died in 1923, followed by his two elder brothers. His second elder brother, Shouhian, had no children and his widow, Xu, is now alone. His eldest brother, Xiaoxian, left four children: Shiyuan, Shifen, Shisun, and daughter. After the death of Kuai Li on September 2nd of last year, she left two parts of the estate: (1) Real estate and movable property worth about 130,000 national currency; (2) A estate worth about 50,000 yuan. Shitai's widow Huibo believed her son was one of the people entitled to inherit the inheritance above. Because her son was underage, she hired Yang Linzhi, Ye Shaoying, and other lawyers as legal representatives and brought a suit against Kuai Shuping, Kuai Xu, and Shiyuan, Shijing, Shifen, and Shisun in the First Special Court to divide the estate. The lawsuit stated that apart from Shouhian, who had no descendants, Shuping was unmarried and should be equally divided with the three-part analysis by the Xiaoxian and Xiuxian. The plaintiff is the son of Xiuxian and should inherit one part. The 50,000 yuan part, apart from Shuping who had no right to inherit, should be equally divided by the Xiaoxian, Shouhian, and Xiuxian, and the plaintiff should also inherit one part. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Gongyu opened the trial, and each defendant hired Wu Baotai and Xu Jiaji as lawyers to represent them in court. They expressed objections to the plaintiff's division of the three parts. They also said that Kuai Li had a total of four sons and one daughter, but one of them, Nianxian, died before marrying, so there were not only three sons and one daughter, so the estate should be analysed as four parts. Then, the plaintiff's mother, Huibo, testified in court. She was 39 years old. Although she had joined Chinese citizenship earlier, she still did not speak Chinese, but testified in English, which was translated by a translator. Under questioning by Judge Xu, it was argued that the retreat be postponed for review.

### Municipal Government Orders Rickshaw Association to Approve Collection of Membership Fees

The Special District Rickshaw Association, because the Public Works Bureau handled the self-donation license of the car owners, the membership fee was not in place, and requested relief from the Municipal Government. Yesterday, the Municipal Government approved the collection as usual, and the association has notified all members. It is hereby announced that the business rickshaw in the city has been implementing the insurance donation system. Members pay membership fees when they go to the association to stamp the seal every month. It has been a year since this system has been in place. Since the beginning of this year, the insurance donation system has been cancelled. All members paid membership fees, and the method has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval in Approval No. 4357. The competent authority has designated a bank to collect the fees on behalf of the government. When donating the license every month, the taxation offices in the South and North of the city must verify that the membership fees have been paid before the license can be obtained. This month is due to the sudden timing and there is not enough time to contact the bank to collect the fees. Except for the bank to collect the fees after the announcement, all membership fees for this month and last month will still be collected by this office. Please donate the license to the car owners, and send the membership fees for each car to the weaving office at one corner per month, and receive the receipt member card so that it can be presented when donating the license. In addition to publishing in the newspaper, this is specially announced

### The Municipal Party Department sent a letter to the Municipal Government to ban the increase of copper coins

The Municipal Party Department sent a letter to the Municipal Government yesterday, saying: "Dear Sir, since the government implemented the legal tender on November 4, 1935, the market price of copper coins in this city was set at 300 copper coins per legal tender yuan. The market was stable and the people were convenient. However, due to the proximity of the Lunar New Year, a general group of merchants seized the opportunity to manipulate and deliberately raise the copper coin debt, with each yuan only exchanging for about 280 copper coins. This not only violates the law, but also affects finance and endangers the livelihood of the poor. It is proposed that your government take swift and effective measures to maintain the market. We hereby send a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government and hope that you will review and handle it accordingly."

### Hui Kang Steamer Not Yet Salvaged

Another Attempt to Tow Today

The Hui Kang steamer of the Huitong Shipping Company, which ran aground on a stone embankment on the morning of the 4th while entering the port from Ningbo, was inspected yesterday morning by surveyors from the insurance company. The results showed that the bottom of the bow hold, six feet above the waterline, was stuck on the embankment. As a result, the Northern Shipping Company's tugboat did not dare to tow it at the time, fearing that the embankment would tear the bottom of the ship. The current salvage plan is to pump water into the aft hold, hoping to raise the front part of the ship's hull, and then tow it out during high tide. If this fails, another attempt will have to wait until the large spring tide next week. Therefore, the ship salvage operation yesterday failed to dislodge the vessel, and the final decision was to load the aft hold of the Hui Kang with enough coal to raise the bow, while simultaneously filling the bottom of the bow hold with a large number of sandbags, so that the hull can withstand less friction damage from the embankment stones. It is said that all work is now complete, and salvage efforts will resume today.

### Shanghai South Tobacco Exchange Holds Emergency Meeting Yesterday

Requesting Central Bank to Issue More Copper Coins

The Shanghai South Office of the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Association held an emergency meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at its office in the Great South Gate, because the Central Bank entrusted the Tobacco Exchange Association to exchange one-cent new copper coins, but the office can only receive three boxes per day, totaling 600 yuan. All of the more than 1,000 businesses in the southern district can only receive a little over one yuan each, which is far from enough. In particular, with the old year-end approaching, the need is even greater. More than a dozen committee members attended the meeting, including Kang Chuxin, Qian Wenda, Qiu Tanglin, Chai Zhisheng, Chen Kunxian, Chen Zhenxiang, Qian Xuanqing, Chen Enqi, Li Jingxing, and Wang Bingzhong. Qiu Tanglin, the chairman, reported the purpose of the meeting, and then discussed the following relief measures for exchanging one-cent copper coins: ㊀ The association requested the Central Bank to allocate two boxes of one-cent copper coins, totaling 600 yuan, to the office each day. The more than 1,000 members in the southern city were allocated this money, but it was insufficient. If this continues, it will be difficult to stabilize debt exchange. The meeting resolved to ask the association chairman, Chen Kunxian, to contact the Central Bank again to request an increase in issuance. ㊁ The Central Bank is closed on Sundays. The association should request the bank to increase the amount issued on Saturdays to facilitate distribution. The meeting resolved to send a letter to the association requesting the Central Bank's approval. ㊂ It was discovered that the market was exchanging one national currency yuan for only 98 fen of one-cent copper coins, which was clearly a profiteering opportunity for unscrupulous merchants and damaged the reputation of the industry. The meeting resolved to request the association to unify the exchange price among the industry to ensure uniformity. The meeting adjourned at around 11:00 AM.

### Travel Industry Association Writes Letter to French Police Requesting Investigation of Anonymous Accusations

The Travel Industry Association of this city recently wrote a letter to the French Police requesting an investigation and cessation of anonymous accusations against hotels in the French Concession. The original letter is extracted below: "Respectfully, according to reports from major hotels in the French Concession, there have recently been frequent anonymous accusations to the French Police Department and the French Municipal Council regarding violations. The authorities do not investigate and immediately dispatch detectives to search, often catching wind and grasping shadows, and the result is nothing. Travelers have already suffered unexpected panic and are unbearable to harassment. This situation may be due to malicious extortion or jealousy among competitors. The authorities must investigate and severely punish this kind of anonymous accusation, otherwise this trend will be detrimental to business and harass travelers. At this time of business decline, how can we withstand this blow? We all bear heavy burdens. The authorities do not provide protection, but lightly believe in a piece of anonymous accusation and immediately conduct unwarranted searches, disturbing travelers. We should forward a letter to the French Police Department to raise a serious protest and investigate and severely punish this matter at any time to prevent bad customs and stabilize business." After checking the association's records, the claims are indeed true. Anonymous accusations are not permitted by law. The matter should be reported to your department. In the future, if there are any such anonymous accusations, they must be investigated and severely punished to prevent bad customs and stabilize business. Sincerely, the Shanghai Travel Industry Association, February 5th, to the French Police Department.

### Grain

Rumors Spread of Continued Orders for Foreign Wheat

Standard Wheat Falls About One Dime

Yesterday, the futures wheat market opened in the morning showing signs of continued decline for all months. The prices for foreign wheat were slightly lower in the American and Canadian markets, while Australian wheat rose two pence. Therefore, the market was initially stable. However, by closing, the flour market had already fallen, and rumors spread that factories in Tianjin and Qingdao had placed orders for a ship of foreign wheat, further depressing confidence. Prices fell two to eight fen compared to the opening. In the afternoon session, because the exchange would be closed for nine days, many clients holding long positions, wary of continued orders for foreign wheat, aggressively sold off. The market gradually declined three to five fen. According to market insiders, the wheat harvest in 1936 was abundant, and inventory in producing regions was higher than in previous years. As the season for new wheat in China gradually approaches, old stocks must be continuously sold off. A major shift in market sentiment is feared because of this.

Large-Scale Liquidation of Long Positions

Futures Flour Also Becomes Unstable

Yesterday, the flour market initially appeared stable but then experienced a sharp decline for all months. Prices for foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada fell by varying amounts, while Liverpool rose by two pence. Therefore, the market sentiment was initially stable, with little difference from the previous day's close. However, due to settlement, yesterday was the last day of trading, and both internal and external transactions were awaiting completion. As a result, the situation was superficially calm but inherently fragile. Subsequently, the market gradually declined. Rumors spread that factories in Tianjin and Qingdao had placed further orders for a ship of foreign wheat, totaling seven or eight thousand tons, at a price of nine yuan and ten fen. Consequently, clients holding long positions aggressively liquidated their positions, and the market became unstable. By the afternoon session, the news of continued foreign wheat orders had spread throughout the market, and outside long positions seemed unable to resist further selling pressure, resulting in a sharper decline. Prices for both near and distant months fell by a significant six to eight fen. Given this situation, the market after settlement, may see a sluggish market, and a sharp decline should be guarded against.

River Rice Arrivals and Sales Both Scarce

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of goods from various regions showed no arrivals from the Jiangsu-Tong region. Only a dozen boats arrived with Bo rice and early rice, totaling approximately three to four thousand five hundred shi. Sales were slow due to the approaching end of the trading period. Retailers were only replenishing stocks slightly, and bulk buyers only took a little over a thousand packages of Bo rice from the Qingdao region. Therefore, the market situation remained unchanged, showing a steady state. Prices for both thick and thin Japonica rice remained unchanged, and no specific varieties had significant sales. From today, the South Shanghai rice market will close, awaiting reopening after the New Year.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, ten boats arrived from various river ports. The distribution of goods in the market was weaker than before, as rice shops were well-stocked and settlement of accounts approached. Prices for high-quality white Japonica rice weakened by a few fen to nearly a dime, while the lower-quality rice remained stable. Early rice was scarce, and prices held firm. Bo rice was weak, and white Yuan rice showed some loosening. Prices for various Indica and other rice varieties showed a weakening trend. After the close, some merchants considered suspending transactions.

Guest Indica Rice Prepared for New Year Display

Yesterday, Guest Indica rice continued to arrive from various ports, but all was prepared for display after the New Year. Traders had also stopped trading. Except for shipping existing stock, there was no new trade enquiries from the Guest region. Therefore, yesterday, the total market only sold a few hundred packages of milled brown rice in the morning, distributed between Xiamen and this street. The market situation was similar to the previous day. The Guest Indica rice market thus concludes here.

### Yarn and Cotton

Warehouse Yarn Inventory Increases

Yarn Alone Drops More Than One Yuan This Month

The yarn market is calm and trending moderately, as yesterday was the last day, and major long and short position holders lacked competitive drive, having to decide the outcome next spring. However, someone from Changfeng released 7,300 bales, and the third-grade yarn market was unbalanced, so the trading floor appeared slightly looser. As for spot yarn, customer sales remained narrow, and confidence weakened further. However, gold traders, securities traders, and Indian merchants all held long positions in the February futures, so future changes are truly alarming. The yarn inventory in warehouses has gradually increased, reaching more than 16,000 bales.

Large-Scale Disgorgement by Changfeng

The futures yarn market opened with mixed results, with prices varying up or down by two or three jiao, as today was the last day of business, and the market was extremely quiet. Major long and short position holders remained inactive, and all transactions were for small amounts to settle trades. Market prices lacked excitement. The results for standard yarn in May showed mixed gains and losses compared to the previous day's close, varying up or down by one, two, or three jiao. In the afternoon session, the market softened due to large-scale disgorgement by Changfeng Yichang, coupled with weak yarn sales. The third-grade yarn market gradually declined, and market prices were affected. As a result, the current month fell by nine jiao compared to the morning close, February fell by two jiao, and the rest remained unchanged.

Yarn Factories on Holiday Break

Cotton Market Lacks Excitement

The cotton market is ordinary, and there are no significant gains or losses, as the overseas cotton market remains in a state of consolidation, and confidence is weakening. However, the supply from various sources is declining, and factory demand is weak due to the approaching end of the lunar year, with yarn factories taking a few days off.

Standard Cotton Down Slightly

The futures cotton market opened with prices down slightly, due to the sluggishness of American cotton and the rise of Indian cotton. However, the supply from various sources felt notably lacking, and floating traders actively covered their positions, causing the market to turn upward. However, trading within the market was very sparse. The results for standard cotton in all months showed gains and losses of five fen compared to the previous day's close. In the afternoon session, the market situation was very flat and tired, fluctuating up and down by five fen, and trading was very light. The results for all months showed a decline of five fen to one jiao compared to the morning close.

Pledged American Cotton Was Sold Off Yesterday

Yesterday, the American cotton market opened firm due to good news from Liverpool. Overnight, traders and some foreign merchants bought, and the market rose firmly. Prices for all months rose by two to seven points. Afterwards, cotton with mortgages was sold off in the market for the first time, causing uneasiness. This led to the liquidation of long positions, especially the May futures on Wall Street. Fortunately, traders bought on dips, and the decline was slightly curtailed. Finally, short position holders covered, and prices firmed again. Export demand is expected to improve. Currently, some cotton cannot be shipped out due to the Pacific Coast sailors' strike. At the same time, Germany and Italy may also be buyers. The close was firm, with spot prices down five points and futures prices unchanged to down five points. English cotton spot prices rose eight points, and futures prices rose four or five points. Indian cotton initially fell due to hedging and selling by short position holders, but rebounded later due to buying by speculators and favorable news from Liverpool. Calcutta rose 0.75 to 1 rupee, Oomra rose 0.75 to 1 rupee, and Broach rose 1 to 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (4th dispatch).

According to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the 5th: Broach at 227.5 rupees, Oomra at 210 rupees, down 0.75 rupees, and Calcutta at 182 rupees, down 0.5 rupees.

Generally, only tomorrow remains for trading, and business will resume on February 15th. Yesterday, the market was stable. Eastern fine cloth occasionally retreated slightly (2.5 fen per piece). Fine twill from local factories also fell 5 fen. Spring cloth, both high and low grades, remained firm. Yarn, whipcord, colored cloth, and coarse cloth selling prices were unchanged.

Woolen Sales Temporarily Suspended

The woolen market can be said to have completely stopped in recent days. Merchants are only busy collecting accounts and are not paying much attention to transactions. This is a common phenomenon before the year-end closing. The samples put out by the Qiu Huo brokers have also been collected. However, in previous years at this time, merchants and non-merchants often took the opportunity to buy up mortgaged goods, old stock, or closing-down stock. However, this year, because most of the old goods have been sold, this type of transaction is nowhere to be found.

(2) When delivering, the bank has the right to accept or reject the customer's position slips, but the guaranteeing broker may not use the high or low price in the position slips as an excuse to evade their responsibility. (3) When the foreign exchange transactions made by the customer and the bank are due, if the number of purchases and sales is sufficient to offset each other, regardless of whether it is guaranteed by the broker, the bank may give priority to offsetting without prior agreement. If the customer cannot pay the settlement silver, the guaranteeing broker should be responsible for paying the principal and interest. If several brokers have handled the offsetting transactions at the same time, the losses should be borne by each broker in proportion to the components of the transactions they have made. For the purpose of calculating the ratio of losses to be borne by each broker, the bank may close both sides of the purchase and sale at the closing market price of the day and recover the losses from each broker according to the amount. After the settlement, if one party of the transaction has a surplus, the bank may temporarily retain the surplus until all problems are solved. (4) If the foreign exchange sold by the customer to the bank is offset against the position slips of other banks, the settlement silver payable to the bank, if the customer cannot pay, and several brokers have handled it at the same time, the bank may average the prices of the position slips submitted by the customer and offset them separately against the settlement price of each purchase originally made by the bank. The losses should be recovered by the bank from each injured broker in proportion to the components of the transactions they have made. (5) If the customer suspends exchange, goes bankrupt, declares bankruptcy liquidation, or fails to fulfill the obligation of an order for any reason, the foreign exchange transactions made with the bank, whether or not they are due, should be handled by the guaranteeing broker by providing a position slip from another bank agreed by the bank, or by another bank guaranteeing delivery, or by closing the transaction at market prices, unless the bank agrees in writing. If the broker does not handle it in accordance with the above, the bank may close it at the closing market price of the day, but the bank has no obligation to close it on behalf of the broker. The losses should be fully borne and compensated immediately by the guaranteeing broker. (Note 1) Article 745 of the Civil Code: Before the creditor forcibly executes the property of the principal debtor and it is ineffective, the guarantor may refuse to pay the creditor.

Introduction to Major National Financial Events in 1936

Mr. Pan Hengmin's "Major National Financial Events in 1936" is divided into two parts, currency and banking, and is described with rich and concise materials, which is very convenient for inspection. I think that not only the financial sector should be like this, but also the industrial and commercial sectors should not lack the need for similar works. Perhaps Mr. Pan has pioneered this path, and I hope that similar works will be created in the future, providing us with major events classified by categories for inspection, which can save a lot of effort. Wouldn't that be great? This book is sold by Liming Bookstore and other distributors on Sima Road, priced at 4 jiao.

### Embarking on the Road to War

— Hu Dui

A Word to Women in Their Boudoirs

The crisis of 1936 that the world's prophets told us about fortunately did not erupt, but the oncoming 1937 is still not very optimistic. The author is certainly not a world prophet, but Western Europe and East Asia are filled with combustible flames: Hitler and Mussolini have never changed their resolutions, and the civil war in Spain can only be prolonged and expanded. In addition, if the Eastern country, which calls itself the England of the East, still conducts its so-called military diplomacy, then the German-Japanese agreement or the Japanese-Italian communication, these things will inevitably form mutual relations due to the mutual interests of each other. So, looking at the world as a whole, our future is not optimistic. Even stepping back and looking at the space and position occupied by our country and nation, it will also make our hair stand on end!

Since the four northeastern provinces were occupied, the Jizhong-Sui provinces incident followed, and then there were rumors of the independence of the five northern provinces. Fortunately, people whose conscience has not died are unwilling to be other people's puppets, but people always think that we can be deceived, using all their energy to destroy our security. Therefore, our current position is in a state of extreme danger, and the space occupied by the nation-state has been exploited bit by bit. Therefore, from now on, all of us, men, women, old and young, must shoulder the responsibility of saving the country and saving ourselves, especially young women. For the warmth of the boudoir, now is not the time to talk about it.

We don't need to talk about any more theories. Just open our ears and eyes to hear and see. Here are teams of women going to the front lines to participate in combat or comfort soldiers, and there are teams of women participating in drills, rescue, or shooting. The time spent applying powder and rouge has been changed to making clothes and uniforms to comfort the soldiers. Beauty is natural beauty, health is natural health, without artificial decoration and affectation. As long as you can endure hardship and undertake any construction on the battlefield, that is a healthy woman.

The bugle and war drums are urging us forward, "Da Duo, Da Duo, step on the battle line, step on the battle line." This is the era forcing us to move forward. Embarking on the road to war is not a fashionable requirement, but a mobilization that everyone in China and the world should participate in. We are not fighting for ambition and desire, we are only fighting for national liberation and national independence.

### Will Women Participate in Future Wars?

— Translated from the British Evening News

In the recent Spanish Civil War, women fought alongside men with great courage. Is this a precedent for future wars? If countries go to war in the future, should women be allowed or forced to go to the front lines? This has now become a question. A university professor, an army officer, and several other figures whose views are worthy of respect solemnly predict that in the next war, women will definitely be conscripted, and even British women will not be exempt. This conscription is not like in the last European war, where women only served in auxiliary corps. Instead, they will be soldiers directly confronting the enemy. I felt a chill upon hearing this opinion, but after careful consideration and assessing all the circumstances, I dare not say that it is impossible. The first thing that can be decided is that if Britain is attacked by a strong power or a coalition of strong powers, then it must resist with the strength of all men and women in the country in order to remain undefeated. After the outbreak of war, it goes without saying that all men and women of military age will be conscripted to perform the military service deemed appropriate by the government. In the final emergency, physically strong women may be ordered to operate guns and cannons. In future wars, the two armies will be far apart. Machine guns and rifles can hit enemy defenses beyond the line of sight, and cannons can fire over several miles. The newest and most lethal weapon, the bomber, can bomb concentrated troops and naval vessels with deadly poison gas bombs from the sky. These new weapons can be used by both men and women and do not rely on strong physical strength. The lightness of the machine gun is especially suitable for women's lithe bodies. As for cannons, as long as you know arithmetic and can calculate range and direction, women can use them as skillfully as men. In addition, British female pilots have shown that they can take risks and endure hardships as well as men, so aerial warfare presents no difficulty for women. It is absurd to say that the hundreds of successful female pilots in Britain today would not be able to operate fighter planes in a future war. In view of the above points, the past arguments that women are physically inferior to men and cannot wield weapons to defend their territory are now nonsense. Whether women should participate in the war is now merely a moral question, or perhaps an emotional one. However, in my personal opinion, no civilized government, no matter how militaristic, has ever dreamed of using force in this matter. The crux of the matter is whether women are willing to participate in the war. If they are willing, will men approve? In my lifetime, the nature and status of British women have changed dramatically. They share civil rights with men, have the same voting rights, can hold various occupations, and compete with men for a living in many industries. Men, for their part, are very willing for women to be on an equal footing with them, acknowledging their fundamental rights as citizens. But there is one thing they will definitely refuse: they will resolutely oppose turning women into killers. If Britain is attacked by a strong enemy, men will be as brave as before, standing up to kill and repel the enemy. They will loudly protest against training women to use guns, cannons, and bombs. In our Britain, women are greatly respected, and it would be an unspeakable degradation to plunge them into bloody and cruel affairs.

### Matters to Note During the Winter Vacation

— Dan Xing

It is currently the winter vacation, and female students have already left school and returned to their hometowns. But how should they spend this month-long vacation? Some female students think that the summer vacation is for "escaping the heat" and the winter vacation is for "escaping the cold." They should temporarily put aside all their studies and order their servants all day to stoke the stove, sit around the fire for warmth, and eat and lie down, truly enjoying the blessings of a vacation. Or they might look at plum blossoms or ice skate. At worst, they might play cards with their families. Recreation and entertainment are also a kind of spiritual and physical rest, which is unavoidable during the holidays. I do not oppose it in any way, but I believe it is a great "luxury" to spend the entire vacation completely on "playing," "eating," and "sleeping." Why not use this vacation time to do some work?

Some female students may say: We are still studying. What work can we do? Household chores are done by servants, and financial distribution is done by our parents. Indeed, a comfortable living environment can foster a petty-bourgeois identity that does not know what work is. However, can the current comfortable environment permanently sustain your enjoyment of blessings, and can you permanently hide in school without going out into society? I can answer for you with certainty: Absolutely not. Neither the current nor the future society will give people the right to enjoy comfort. Men have to rely on work to earn a living. How can women be an exception? Perhaps, even today, there are still women who hold the mistaken idea that as long as they can marry a wealthy and capable husband, they can live a life of ease. This is forgivable in uneducated and unknowledgeable women. However, it is deeply regrettable if knowledgeable women still think this way.

Those many wanderers lost in confusion are waiting for insightful and knowledgeable individuals to dispel their illusions and rescue them from dire straits. How can we allow ourselves to repeat their mistakes? Only those who earn their own living can achieve true liberation, and only those who earn their own living can establish an independent personality. Therefore, we must cultivate the ability to make a living as early as possible. What we get in school is only limited textbook education. Current facts tell us that just possessing book knowledge is still dangerous for our livelihoods. The "taking risks" of college students and the suicide of a couple who were a book editor and an obstetrician, respectively, forced by life are "ironclad proof." Recently, the government has been focusing on vocational education and establishing more vocational schools for this very reason. We should be vigilant during our studies.

I sincerely hope that female students will not only enjoy the blessings of a warm stove during the winter vacation. They may as well practice household service and community service. If one person's ability is not enough, they can gather more classmates or fellow villagers to do it together. Whether it's at a weaving machine or in the fields, work has no distinction between high and low and has no boundaries. Even just the short month-long winter vacation is an excellent opportunity to train your ability to endure hardship and lay a solid foundation for self-reliance and making a living.

### How to Cook Food

— Jie Fen

—Common Sense a Smart Housewife Should Have—

The most difficult task for a housewife every day is how to prepare some good food. Here are some methods for cooking common foods, which is also common sense a smart housewife should have:

Cooking Pork:

Pork is most difficult to tenderize. You can add a little hawthorn, which will quickly tenderize it while preserving its flavor. Another method: You can add baking soda, but it is not as good as hawthorn.

Cooking Ham: The skin of ham is extremely difficult to tenderize. If you coat it with white sugar before putting it in water, it will tenderize in an instant, and the flavor will be rich and delicious.

Cooking Salted Meat: If salted meat has a foul smell, add more than ten walnuts with holes drilled in their shells to the pot while cooking. This will reduce the foul smell.

Cooking White Tripe: After boiling pig tripe, cut it into long pieces, place them in a bowl, then add a little broth and steam it on top of a rice cooker. This will double its thickness. However, do not use salt, otherwise it will become hard and shrink.

Cooking Mutton: Use a whole radish, drill small holes all over it, and put it in the broth with the mutton to cook for forty minutes. Then remove the radish, and then braise it in red sauce or white sauce. This will eliminate the fishy and gamey taste.

Cooking Old Duck: When putting the duck in the pot, add a few snails and cook them together. This will make it tender and cooked quickly.

Cooking Sea Cucumber: To make it expand quickly, you can throw in small pieces of broken porcelain, which will make it expand very quickly.

Cooking Vegetables: When cooking vegetables, above-ground stems should be cooked in boiling water; underground stems should be cooked in cold water. However, sweet potatoes are an exception.

Cooking Kelp: Kelp is tough. Even after cooking it for a long time, it is difficult to soften, which is a waste of time and firewood, which is regrettable. If you add a little vinegar while cooking, it will be easy to soften and become palatable.

Cooking Black Dates: You can cook them with pith of grass, and the skin will come off by itself.

Cooking Fresh Fish: Wait until the pot is hot, then do not add oil first. Instead, rub the pot almost entirely with a piece of ginger, then add oil and cook the fish. No matter what, the fish skin will not stick to the bottom of the pot and cause the fish meat to fall apart.

Cooking Potatoes: After putting potatoes in the pot, if their color seems to be turning black, you can add a few drops of vinegar to the water they are being cooked in. This will make them white, soft, and palatable.

Cooking Eggs: When cooking eggs, wet them with cold water first, then put them in boiling water. This will prevent them from cracking.

Cooking Bamboo Shoots: Boiling fresh bamboo shoots in boiling water will make them cooked easily, crisp, and delicious. Or add a little mint and sprinkle a few grains of salt, and they will not be astringent.

### Interview Notes at the Women's Education Center

— Zhang Zhang

Educational opportunities should be equal. Regardless of whether they are men or women, as long as they are human beings with round toes and square heads, then everyone has the right to enjoy education, and everyone should be able to read and write. However, despite the theoretical statement, in reality, due to the feudal idea of valuing men over women that has prevailed in China for thousands of years, it is firmly entrenched in the minds of the general public. It is generally believed that men should be able to read and write and enjoy education, while women? Under the slogan "Lack of talent in a woman is a virtue," they are deprived of the opportunity to enjoy education. What a cruel and unreasonable thing that is!

In recent decades, the call for women to enjoy education has gradually attracted social attention. As a result, in addition to the rise of girls' schools, institutions and organizations dedicated to women's education have continued to be established. (The Shanghai Women's Education Center is one of the organizations dedicated to women's education. Here, the author reports to the readers on the center's recent situation and scope of work.)

On a cold winter morning, in order to understand the actual situation of women's education centers, I hired a streetcar and went straight to Hualong Road. Upon reaching the gate of the center, I explained my purpose to the gatekeeper, and a service staff member named Wang Qing began to guide me to the reception room.

Our conversation began at this time. According to this staff member, the Women's Education Center has been established for four or five years. The director is Mr. Zhou Baoshao. Mr. Zhou's purpose in establishing the Women's Education Center was because he saw that many housewives had not received adequate education, which led them to stick to old ways in handling household affairs and lacked good plans. This has a close relationship with social order and the future of the nation. In order to enable housewives to generally acquire some common sense of managing a home, skills in handling household affairs, and knowledge of childcare and hygiene, he decided to establish this Shanghai Women's Education Center as a starting point for implementing women's education. After its establishment, thanks to the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life, the development of the center's affairs has been quite rapid. The center holds a weekly meeting to discuss the direction of the center's work and also runs a women's remedial school, enrolling older housewives who have dropped out of school to attend remedial classes at the center. They charge very low tuition fees, hoping that older women in the vicinity who have dropped out of school will have the opportunity to receive remedial education at the center. They organize a Housewives' Association, which holds monthly meetings to discuss family problems and invite female leaders to give speeches at the meetings. They also organize a Mothers' Association, which also holds monthly meetings to discuss childcare methods and parenting issues. In addition, they organize women's vocational training classes, teaching craft skills. For example, the weaving class, which ended last December, was able to arouse the interest of women in general. In addition to these, we also publish a Women's Monthly, which publishes issues on women's issues and extracts news from the women's world, and the subscription target is entirely women."

As for the center's funding, this staff member said, "It is entirely borne by Director Zhou. If the amount is not enough, he solicits donations from the outside world. At present, there are no problems with income and expenditure. However, in order to run more businesses related to women's education, we hope that the government will provide considerable subsidies to support the development of women's education. This is something that we hope to achieve in the shortest possible time."

The clock pointed to eleven o'clock. Unwilling to take up the staff member's valuable time, I shook hands with him and said goodbye. On the way back, I silently wished the center a long and successful future, creating a great new life for women's education in China.

### Idle Talk About Child Brides

— Xia Fei

Child brides are a product of the old etiquette and the old marriage system, a kind of blind marriage based on matchmakers' words and parents' orders. However, its legacy has not yet been completely eliminated, and the tragedy of child brides continues to be played out in the old families of those remote villages. If we are willing to go to these places to investigate, I believe we will find many so-called child brides, especially those who have come from child bride backgrounds.

In fact, the life of a child bride is no different from that of a maidservant, except that the title and status are different. However, we only hear calls for the abolition of prostitution and maidservants, but not calls for the abolition of the child bride system! In fact, if we want to seek women's liberation and thoroughly reform the marriage system, we must first eliminate the widespread child bride system that kills the happiness of men and women.

Although the knowledge of the general villagers is a little more enlightened than before, and they seem to be less stubborn about their children's marriages than in the past, they still absolutely disagree with laissez-faireism, and fatalism and matchmakers' words are still flourishing unabated. Especially the child bride system, which has become more widespread than in the past. Although the parties concerned have changed the name to "tong jiao xifu" (child foot wife) in order to avoid the title of "yang xifu" (adopted wife), in fact, isn't it still one and the same? It's just a clever name change.

As for the origin of child brides, although I don't know which dynasty it started in, the reasons are generally either betrothal in the womb, or because the two families are close friends, or because they want to save money and are poor. In the past, these reasons were considered very legitimate or unavoidable.

As for a girl, whether she is in swaddling clothes or in her teens, once she becomes someone else's child bride, all her fate and life will be controlled by her future parents-in-law, and her freedom will be deprived from then on. It is not until she and her fiancé formally announce their marriage that her days can get a little better. If her fiancé is a person of bad behavior, she may be threatened and ravaged by him, so the matter of "eating cold rice" and "sitting in the corner" often happens in families with child brides. If she unfortunately dies herself, there is naturally nothing to say. If the fiancé dies, then she is mostly a widow guarding the grave. Until she has lived out the three years of filial piety and guarded the filial piety, she prepares to be determined to guard the punishment and win the beautiful name of a chaste woman (?). In addition, if she wants to walk out - to marry - then in addition to seeking the consent of the parents-in-law, she must also pay a considerable bride price to the parents-in-law. On the contrary, the parents-in-law can casually marry her off to someone else, or recruit a "yellow mud shoulder son-in-law" to the house to replace their son's duties; she, of course, still has to honor them with the etiquette of a daughter-in-law serving her parents-in-law.

There are also two types that are considered upright and very common in the countryside: ㊀ is to "chongxi" (ward off bad luck); - when the fiancé is sick in bed and is about to give up hope of medicine, the family members use the superstitious custom to have the child bride marry a patient with no hope of living, send him to the bridal chamber, and eventually hasten his death due to overwork, so that the innocent girl becomes an unjustifiably a widow, "small then ends her precious youth, and the great one sacrifices her lifelong happiness: this kind of superstitious custom that is useless should be overthrown as soon as possible. ㊁ Whenever a child bride's fiancé dies, if her fate is not bad, then she will be matched with the fiancé's younger brother, which is called "one uncle takes his sister-in-law."

According to what I have heard and seen, there are countless tragic stories about child brides, and the experiences of all child brides are mostly very bad. Therefore, I deeply feel that child brides are indeed a serious problem in the women's movement!

### Fourth Letter

— (Zhuo Dai)

Ms. B:

I was just about to talk to someone about the most important issue in our country's families. Now that you are discussing with me how gardens and our lives are related, what kind of great mission do they have? That day, I can take this opportunity to talk to you about it. Women are the masters of the family, so this issue should be discussed with women even more.

Family, family, everyone shouts it, everyone says it. May I ask: We call it a family, have we ever reflected on ourselves? Do some of us feel ashamed? Although we Chinese have a home, where is the "ting" (courtyard)? How many people have a "ting" in their homes? Can we call it a family if we have a home but no "ting"? This is a very serious problem for us Chinese. A Shanghai-style house, a crab-eye patio like a chimney, can this be called a "ting"? A home with a vacant lot, where washing clothes, rinsing rice, and dumping garbage are done, can this be called a "ting"? In reality, Chinese families are just homes and nothing more; they don't have a "ting."

What is a "ting"? How can it be called a "ting"? A "ting" is the garden that I am discussing with you. It doesn't necessarily have to be a so-called garden of dozens of acres to be called a garden. As long as it matches the house, there is such a vacant lot, and we think about it from an aesthetic point of view and a practical point of view, and we don't necessarily need a lot of money to arrange it into an elegant garden. This is very necessary for our lives.

We either don't have a family at all, but if we have the name of a family, we can't make it a incomplete family. We must attach a "ting" to the outside of the house. This is not a luxurious lifestyle, it is very necessary for our bodies and minds. Men, after working hard all day outside, can't be locked up in a house like being sued in court when they go back at night. In the "ting," in the flower-lit moonlight, playing with their wives, this is the joy of family. When resting on Sundays, there is no need to take a train out to travel, you can just rest at home. When friends come, they can also pass the time in the "ting."

For women, the "ting" is even more important than for men. Men go out more often, while women are at home all day. If they don't use the "ting" to regulate their spirit and body, they will sit at home with their heads down, and there will be no change at all, which is really a painful thing. As for children, running and jumping, it is even more indispensable to have such a "ting." The two words "family" were originally connected and parallel. Recently, I don't know how they have become distorted, so we must restore them.

Building a garden, everyone thinks, is a very expensive thing, but it is not really so. If the house is small, the area of the garden is naturally also small, so the cost is limited. Moreover, the materials for the garden are nothing more than trees and stones. Of course, there are expensive ones and there are also many cheap ones, and expensive materials may not necessarily make a good garden. Whether the garden is good or not! It all depends on the art of the person who arranged it. This is like painting. Using the same few pigments, some can become famous paintings, and some can only be window decorations. Therefore, if there is really an art of gardening, then it may be that a garden built with two or three hundred yuan can defeat a garden built with one or two thousand yuan. Ms.! I hope that you will come out to restore the word "family," and not have a name without substance.

### Hopes for Female Writers

— Zhen

Recently, several writers in Shanghai held a "Literary Symposium" at the Youth Association. Almost all the famous writers were present, but it is a strange thing that not a single female writer could be found at such a grand event. Because this symposium was not just to gather their fellow friends to have tea and chat, but also had a greater purpose, which was to unite the entire Chinese literary world on one front to carry out a unified national salvation cultural movement. Therefore, this symposium was far from being a common social gathering. National salvation is everyone's responsibility, and female writers are no exception. Since you can write articles and run publications, you can be considered a member of the literary world. Why should a united front in the literary world leave out a part of its comrades? So I suspect that perhaps none of the Chinese female writers are in Shanghai, or that none of the Chinese women who can write articles and run newspapers are qualified to enter the realm of literature! However, under the word "unification" in the literary world, it is inevitable to feel regrettable!

Therefore, it makes me feel even more that female literary authors have been too silent in recent years! In addition to a few seniors who were once very popular seven or eight years ago, there are not many rising stars. Although there are several women's publications in Shanghai, there are not many mass reading materials that can be taken out and are popular all over the country. There are very few works like Ms. Bing Xin's "Letters to Young Readers" that she used to write. No wonder the literary world has forgotten female writers!

I neither understand literature nor dare to express my opinions rashly. Now I am using the qualification of a young student to hope that the talented female writers, or rather the female compatriots who can write articles, will make great efforts in the literary movement and produce more literary works that save the country and save the people. If the female writers can also hold a female literary symposium to organize some kind of association to work together and research together to produce a large number of national salvation literature, then that would certainly be what I sincerely pray for.

### Correspondence

Mr. Editor: I have just read your publication's issue number 48, containing a Tokyo dispatch titled "A Huge Disturbance That Shocked Students Studying in Japan," and I was extremely astonished after reading it. The article ostensibly concerns the "women's liberation issue" but is actually a vent for personal resentment. I am writing to present the essentials of the matter based on the facts:

(1) Jin Did Not Go Insane: The passage stating, "According to a friend close to Wei Jin, he feigned mental illness to shirk responsibility," is entirely fabricated. Although Jin's wife, Ms. Zeng Yi, became pregnant in 1934 and was admitted to Juntendo Hospital in Tokyo for a threatened miscarriage, he experienced digestive, nasal, and sleep disorders for two years due to the stress of comforting his wife, but he did not go insane.

(2) Jin Did Not Distribute Leaflets: Although Ms. Fei wishes to attribute baseless accusations to Jin by claiming he is insane, it is just as absurd as her accusing Jin of murdering Zeng Yi and oppressing women at the Office of the Supervisor of Students Studying in Japan, because her only evidence accusing Jin of murder is her own "dream." As for the numerous reasons that can prove Jin did not distribute leaflets, the most prominent are: (1) Jin did not go insane. (2) Jin does not engage in such absurd activities. (3) Jin has not seen the so-called leaflets to this day. (4) The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department sent someone to advise Jin that he could sue them legally, but Jin declined with gratitude. (5) Jin has no economic relationship with Ms. Fei, so there is no question of "swindling money"; moreover, they are not close friends, and he does not know Ms. Fei's character in detail.

(3) The Relationship Between Jin and Ms. Zeng Yi: Jin and Ms. Zeng Yi not only have five or six years of marital life but also have three children together, although it was a love marriage, they obtained the consent of both sets of parents. They had a simple wedding reception and received gifts from relatives and friends. Regarding the monetary gifts from both parents, although Ms. Fei brought her to the Office of the Supervisor and filed for divorce on December 23, 1935, Jin has not agreed because her reason for falsely accusing Jin of murder based on a "dream" is untenable. In short, Jin and Ms. Zeng Yi are not only not divorced but also have a long-standing marital relationship, a happy family, and the burden of raising children. Even today, Jin cannot help but love his children's mother, Zeng Yi.

The above is written entirely based on facts, without any falsehoods. I hope that the editor will maintain an impartial attitude and publish it in the newspaper, which will not only protect existing families with children but also prevent young men and women from going astray on the wrong path of "trifling with life." Respectfully, I wish you good health and request your guidance! Wei Jin, January 25th

### After Marriage

— (Huan Yue)

In order to lighten his burden a little, I finally re-entered society in the second month after our marriage!

Luckily, after only two months of probation, my salary has increased from forty yuan to sixty yuan!

Indeed, in this day and age, the gray city of Shanghai is filled with economic depression. Most small businesses have either closed down or are being liquidated. The larger companies that still exist are busy laying off employees and reducing salaries, let alone considering raises. Indeed, I feel very satisfied with this!

Just a small clerk—a typist at a customs brokerage—able to earn two yuan a day without much effort. That's not easy, is it! I often comfort myself this way!

Indeed, I believe nothing is truer than the saying "contentment brings happiness." I think that the place where he works is too far away from me. Unless there is a special event, we will never see each other during the day because we both have our lunches catered by nearby restaurants!

We are both a bit childish and like to walk together. Every evening, I stroll from Jiangxi Road into Nanjing Road, and he comes over from Jing'an Temple Road. Whether one of us is early or late, or whether it's raining or snowing, we wait at the Shanghai First Department Store tram stop!

Sometimes, after dinner, we go to a nearby second-run theater to watch a domestic film, and maybe even listen to storytelling. This is how we spend our days!

He loves to hold small children. Sometimes we bicker about this, and he tidies his clothes and slips outside. I refuse to give in and go into the side room to play cards. After he returns, we laugh and joke again!

### Abolishing the Long Gown and Mandarin Jacket

— Tian Yu

Speaking of the long gown and mandarin jacket, this was the most imposing and legally recognized "formal attire" in our country for the past seven or eight years. Not long ago, General Song Zheyuan specially noted on his invitations to entertain guests: Attendees must wear "blue gown and black mandarin jacket." Furthermore, at important state ceremonies, when the president receives foreign envoys, those who shuffle and stumble are all in blue gowns and black mandarin jackets. Group weddings held in Shanghai also stipulated that the groom's formal attire should be a blue gown and black mandarin jacket. Now, Singaporean overseas merchant Chen Jiageng has telegraphed the National Government, requesting that the formal attire of the long gown and mandarin jacket be abolished. He stated that "the long gown and mandarin jacket are remnants of the Qing dynasty's clothing system, no longer appropriate for the times, and should have been abolished long ago. Continuing to adhere to them as formal attire negatively influences the national psyche and hinders national revival," and so on. Following the same telegram, there is the following annotation: "The clothing system regulations promulgated in 1929 are currently under revision, and the Ministry of Interior has drafted a proposal that is under review." It is possible that the long gown and mandarin jacket, previously designated as one of the eight formal attire options, may be abolished altogether.

The minor matter of clothing may seem unrelated to national welfare and people's livelihoods. However, ever since our ancient ancestors proclaimed, "If one's attire is not proper, disaster will befall the person," the matter of clothing has become very important and complicated. Before the Republic of China, clothing systems throughout the dynasties had distinctions in rank. It goes without saying that there was a great divide between officials and commoners. Even the blue-robed scholars, the so-called literati, had specific scholars' turbans and robes that commoners could not wear casually. One can learn about this by reading *The Scholars*. After the Republic of China, these distinctions naturally no longer existed. However, some people still implicitly acknowledge that clothing is related to some grand principles. The long gown and mandarin jacket embody the principle of preserving Eastern spiritual civilization. The clothing system initially established in the early years of the Republic of China was the Western swallowtail formal dress, clearly derived from foreign forms. The long gown and mandarin jacket are unique to China, and it is most appropriate to say that they preserve Eastern traditional virtues. However, according to Chen Jiageng's telegram, this attire is a remnant of the Manchu Qing dynasty. From a national perspective, it is also a kind of foreign attire. Only because it has been used for a long time has the foreign thing become something inherent. I remember an essay by Mr. Lu Xun about "beards." It is said that the upturned two-cornered beard that is currently popular in Japan was originally a Han Chinese beard style that was transmitted there, while the flat, downward beard that Chinese people now keep is precisely the beard style of the northern barbarian tribes. However, after a long period of transmission, some people mistakenly believe that the Japanese beard style is Japanese and that we should not learn it, while the flat beard is unique to China and is considered to be inherited from our ancestors! This is the same situation as people not realizing that the long gown and mandarin jacket were originally clothing of the Qing dynasty. If Mr. Chen had not pointed it out, we would have forgotten.

In recent years, Chinese traditional spirit has been greatly emphasized in various aspects. Architecture is one example, with painted beams and carved pillars flourishing for a time. However, the content is entirely based on foreign methods, which is also a kind of contradiction. Insisting on preserving all inherent things today, while the spirit may be admirable, often gives a sense of being strenuous and unrewarding. Rather than this, it is better to let history take its course. Discussing clothing led me to these reflections.

### The Lighthouse Keeper

— Li Liwen

Since I was little, my excessively compassionate heart has been moved to trembling by many trivial things.

When I was fourteen years old, my father had to move from Bandung—the place where I grew up—to Cibugis, a quiet seaside town in Cilacap, due to business failures.

There: there were no schools. There was only a long, winding stretch of white sand beach shimmering in the sunlight, the vast blue sea constantly crashing against the shore with white waves, and two stone dikes extending far into the sea, embracing like crab claws—from the shore, one could still see a short tower at the end of each dike, each emitting light throughout the night. In addition, there was what else? A clear blue and lovely sky, perhaps. That watched over the fishermen as they went out to sea in the faint dawn, and watched over them as they rocked back in their small boats in the afterglow of dusk.

I felt lonely.

Every day, I would wander along the beach, picking up shells, digging into the sand to catch small crabs, or go to the woods to find a shady, grassy place to lie down—however, you would always sigh. How can people escape the life of grouping together?

One day, the luminous stone dike that stretched far into the embrace of the sea suddenly aroused my infinite curiosity. I tried walking along the dike—to the front of the lighthouse on the left. The Malay old man who looked after the tower was surprised and befriended me. Afterwards, every morning I would walk along the dike surrounded by the sea and spend the day with the old man; when the sea gently stirred up the wind, and the seagulls and eagles began to circle low above the waves, the old man would send me out of the tower gate.

The old man was lonely. The sea breeze had hunched him over, and the waves made him unable to hear sounds lower than the waves. However, his eyes were sharp, seeing as far as the sea, seeing as clearly as an eagle.

The old man liked to tell stories. He had spent most of his life listening closely to the sound of the waves, and had come up with many stories.

"...Ah, he is a very loving and kind old man! You will not find him in the world, because the devil has made everyone bad—but he will emerge from the sea..."

The old man liked to start like this. He often brought his head almost to my face, and that's how I listened to him speak and tell his stories.

"But won't he drown?"

"No," the old man laughed, his eyes deeply buried in wrinkles. "How can he drown? The white waves that rise and fall are the old man's breath...! When there are too many evil people, the old man will come out, catch the evil people in a big bag, and take them to the depths of the sea..."

The old man made me fantasize. The old man's stories wove a beautiful and lovely picture in my imagination. When I was lonely, I would melt into my illusions, as if I saw the kind and just old man, the fairy of the sea, and the beautiful and tranquil world.

Later, my father had to move the family to the capital, Batavia. When the old man put his ear to my mouth and heard this news, he shook his head, and gently

### Breaking Free from the Clutches of Death

— Xing

In pictures, we can see Death painted, wearing black clothes, wearing a black hat, with eyes that are just two black holes, a mouthful of sharp teeth, and a pair of hands with sharp claws, causing people to die!—The reasons for people's deaths are different, but most are due to illness; so it can also be said that Death uses "illness" as the only tool for killing. However, if people receive appropriate treatment when they are sick, even if they are very ill, they can break free from the clutches of Death.

Appropriate treatment is nothing more than good doctors and good medicine. The Wuzhou Pharmacy has doctors for this purpose and specializes in producing more than three hundred kinds of effective household medicines. It also has consulting rooms for famous doctors of various departments in the building on Fourth Road. The main consultants are the most famous doctors in Shanghai. In this way, those with minor illnesses only need to take over-the-counter medicines, and those with more serious illnesses can seek medical treatment, so there is no way that misfortune cannot be turned into good fortune.

### New Year's Eve Dinner

— Xin Yun

In a living room, there is a table full of food, with dishes of various kinds, and the old and young are sitting around the table, laughing and talking lively: The stove is burning with a raging fire, forgetting the cold; this is the scene of the Li family eating New Year's Eve dinner.

Mrs. Li is already nearly fifty years old, and she is in particularly good spirits today. She ate many dishes and even ate two bowls of rice. She also looked after the children and earnestly urged others to eat, and her spirit was not tired at all.

I remember that last year, Mrs. Li was suffering from anemia, her face was pale, her hands and feet were often cold, and she didn't feel any taste in her food! And she was mentally exhausted! Since she took "Zilai Blood," her complexion has gradually become rosy, her appetite has gradually increased, and all her symptoms have suddenly disappeared, so she can have the joy of eating New Year's Eve dinner today.

said, looking out at the sea from the window:

"I am a lonely person again!"

From Cibugis to Batavia, and for the six years that followed—until now, from Java to Sumatra, to Borneo, and even back to my homeland in the Pearl River or the Yangtze River basin, the threads of my journey have stretched further and further. However, whenever I see the sea, or when a big wind sweeps up at night, I often think of the lighthouse keeper of Cibugis, and his desolate days surrounded by the waves.

"Bless him! The lonely old man!"

I often pray silently.

### New Year in My Hometown

— Shi

In the New Year in my hometown, the most interesting thing for children is the "lion dance."

Each lion dance troupe has about thirty to forty people at most, and more than twenty people at least. Everyone wears the same clothes and ties a belt around their waist, and they are all brave and upright. As soon as the opening cannon of New Year's Day sounds, they start to perform the lion dance at people's homes. The most prosperous period is from New Year's Day to the fifth or sixth day of the new year, and after the fifth or sixth day, it gradually becomes less common. There are four types of lion dance troupes:

Qilin: This is mostly organized by residents of the city, and there are also villages in neighboring cities. This type of lion dance is the most outstanding because it has the most people and the equipment is also neat. The gongs and drums consist of a large cymbal, a loud drum, and a thick copper gong, which sound very loud and majestic. A unicorn head is made of bamboo and paper paste, given beautiful colors, and the whiskers and hair are made of velvet. A cloth of ten feet long and four feet wide is painted with colorful patterns to make the body. At the end of the cloth, a bunch of velvet is used to make the tail. When dancing, one person holds the unicorn head with both hands, and one person bows and bends over at the end of the tail. As soon as the gongs and drums sound, the two people dance various poses in the arena. After the dance, they perform boxing and staff, followed by one-on-one comparisons of weapons such as double knives and spears.

Lion: Most come from nearby villages. The performance is similar to the former, but the gongs and drums are different. The lion's head is flat and round, with a diameter of about two feet. One drum and two gongs are smaller than the former, and the sound is not as loud as the former. The knives, spears, and shields are also relatively small, but some add performances of several people comparing staffs and jumping on tables.

Guest Lion: These are also mostly played by nearby villages. They are probably very similar to "Lion," but the lion's head is not flat and round: it is more than a foot large and looks like a cat's head, and the mandible is movable and can be opened and closed. There are also four people outside the door, wearing masks, two in the shape of monkeys, and two as simpletons, following the lion's dance and making various humorous movements.

Out-of-Town Lion: These all come from other towns. The number of people is relatively small, and the lion's head and gongs and drums are the same as the Guest Lion, but there are no masks. The skills are relatively sophisticated. They often use several tables, and people perform various tricks on the table top.

In addition to the above four types of lion dances, the two that adults welcome more are "lantern wine" and "flower lanterns."

Lantern Wine: On the Lantern Festival, every family must prepare sacrificial offerings to worship the gods and ancestors. On this day, families in the streets and alleys who have raised boys in the past year will set up banquets. If there are families with public property in the clan, then the public will handle the banquet and drink in the ancestral hall. This is called "Lantern Wine." On this night, the bright moonlight and the brilliant lights reflect, doubly loud, mixed with the shouts and laughter of children. Groups of men and women stroll on the streets, watching flower lanterns and swings. The children carry paper lanterns and run around and pour wine randomly, wanting to be crazy with joy. This will continue until late at night before stopping.

Flower Lantern: Lanterns are made of straw and colored paper into figures and pavilions, arranged in a ring next to a tower-shaped frame made of bamboo strips and colored paper, or arranged next to a wooden frame about eight or nine feet long. This is called "Flower Lantern." This kind of flower lantern is mostly hung in the center of larger temples for people to enjoy. After the Lantern Festival, each person uses a strip of red paper and signs a "Respectfully requesting a flower lantern frame" and pastes it under the flower lantern. On the seventeenth day, the temple keeper of the temple will throw the paper signs pasted by each person in front of the gods one by one. The one with the most holy signs (one yin and one yang) will be given this flower lantern frame. When sending it, they beat gongs and drums all the way, playing fine music, and setting off firecrackers, which is also very lively.

Yang Binkui and Yang Zhenxiong's "Jade Kui Dragon"

Yuanchang (1120) 11:45 AM to 12:30 PM

Opening: "Childhood Sentiments" (Mimi Collection Inaugural Issue)

In the dreary rain and sorrowful wind of the third watch of the night, tossing and turning in bed, unable to find peace. Like the weeping of a cuckoo, suddenly evoking memories of childhood. Remembering the beginning, loving and protecting each other like siblings, inseparable for even a single day. In those young and ignorant years, playing innocently together in the courtyard. Later, as we grew older and understood the meaning of spring breezes, we realized the depth of our feelings and spoke of love. Like intertwined branches, like two hearts beating as one, destined by fate in a previous life. Who knew that the Matchmaker's records held no destiny, and our names were not on the Three Lives Stone? Unexpectedly, my aunt took you to Japan, a tragic fate arranged by the heavens. Tears streamed down as we parted, and countless springs have passed in a flash. I trust you are happy with your husband, while I remain a pure and innocent virgin. Forgetting meals and tea, I still spend my days without a companion. Because of you, I am as thin as a rake and my appearance is haggard, my mind wandering in confusing dreams. Because of you, I defied my mother's wishes by being unworthy of marriage, I only love you with all my heart, but alas, you are nowhere to be found. Even the magpie bridge allows the Cowherd and Weaver Girl to meet, can we be together again in this life? Day and night, the thought breaks my heart.

Cao Xiaoying's "Jade Dragonfly"

Zhongxi (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM

Opening: "Sweeping Qin"

Using a body to meditate in Lingyin Temple, writing poems on the wall to "Sweep Qin." Nian Chun arrives, a prime minister of the court, holding three sticks of incense in his hands, silently communicating with the gods. Wishing for favorable weather and abundant harvests, only seeking longevity for the couple. Praying for the virtuous father and son of the Yue family to ascend to the immortal realm early. Raising his head, he suddenly sees the verses, causing the treacherous hero to tremble with fear. The poem was written with his wife, and when the incident was revealed, it was burned in a spring window fire. He immediately angrily asks for the mad monk to be summoned. Who knew that he would speak Zen secrets with many transformations, able to summon wind and rain. Holding a fire tube to communicate with foreign countries, also able to use a palm fiber broom to sweep away treacherous officials. The turmoil only arose from holding exclusive power, unjustly dying at Lengquan Pavilion. Returning home, the couple discussed together, shaving their heads and converting to Buddhism, renouncing fame and fortune. Believing the slander of a gossiping woman, suffering the punishments of Fengdu Hell, until now, cast in iron, the tomb of King Yue.

### New Contributions from the Paris Theater

The Paris Theater, known for holding the screening rights of six major companies, has always been committed to serving the community. With brand new projectors and clear sound and light, it selects films carefully, taking the best and extracting the essence. The excellent reputation it has earned over the past year is universally acknowledged. Recently, it signed a contract with United Artists, an authority in the film industry. Films such as Chaplin's "Modern Times" will also be shown at the theater in turn. Holding so many screening rights is unprecedented among all theaters in Shanghai. It is also rumored that starting from the eve of the abolished lunar new year, the world-renowned all-color feature film "Ramona" has been selected. Anticipating crowds, early screenings will be added from the first to the fourth day of the lunar new year. During this New Year period, films such as "The Grievances of an Isolated Island," "Jingzhong Baoguo," and "Little Pearl" will be shown in succession. However, due to the excessive crowds for major films, the screening periods for each film have been shortened. It is hoped that everyone will pay attention to this.

### Shanghai Grand Theater Shows "Paradise on Earth" During the Abolished Lunar New Year

The dazzling and unparalleled great color love giant film "Paradise on Earth" will be publicly screened at the Shanghai Grand Theater during the old lunar new year. Color films have always been an experiment in Hollywood, but "Paradise on Earth" has reached the pinnacle of perfection and beauty. The director uses the extraordinary strengths of color films everywhere, using moving shots to poetically reveal the most complex, most wonderful, and most highly exciting emotions and images. The protagonist in the film is the mysterious actress Marlene Dietrich. Marlene's previous films have long been household names. In this film, she plays a lovestruck young girl, demonstrating even more consummate skill. Co-starring with her is Joel McCrea. Since Joel's debut in "These Three," this film is truly the actor's masterpiece, it is said.

### The Beginning of the Theater Year: "1937 Theater Society" is Born

There is no doubt that 1937 is considered the year of theater. Following public performances by Zhonglu and amateur groups, the "1937 Theater Society" has also emerged in response and will soon announce its birth, holding its first public performance in a brand new manner.

The naming of the "1937 Theater Society" is perfectly suited to the significance of the year of theater and will undoubtedly remain a memorial in the history of Chinese theater. They are currently actively preparing, and the script is said to be temporarily unannounced, but it is expected to be a powerful work of national defense drama.

### Xie Jun in "New Year's Money"

A young painter, a young man with artistic cultivation and enthusiasm, with an active and burning heart, jumped into the film garden. His dedication, his efforts, and the future glorious harvest can be guaranteed.

Xie Jun, his joining the cast of Mingxing Film Company was not long ago, but his name is already quite familiar to the audience. In "Night Meeting," he played a纨袴 young master, performing the personality and behavior of that kind of person vividly and thoroughly. His amazing talent has since given people a considerable understanding. In "Living and Dying Together," "Qingming Season," and recently "The Eternal Smile," he has played very important roles. The future of this newcomer is bright and splendid.

Now, in Zhang Shichuan's new film "New Year's Money," he plays the father of a poor child, Xiao Sanzi, wearing old and dirty clothes, a couple with Shu Xiuwen, living in a small thatched hut. His child goes everywhere to pick up garbage every day. One day, he accidentally finds a dollar in the trash can, and happily rushes home to show Xie Jun and his wife.

"One dollar" is unremarkable to some people, but for those who are struggling to make ends meet, it is like finding a treasure. The couple competes to look at it, and all the neighbors around come to admire this "one dollar." With many people and many hands, snatching and grabbing, suddenly a fire breaks out in one of the thatched huts. Everyone is busy putting out the fire, and the cries and shouts create chaos. As a result, these many thatched huts are all destroyed for looking at "one dollar," and from then on, that dollar is also buried in the burned site. In this scene, Xie Jun's performance is particularly moving. When it is publicly screened, you will know that this statement is true.

### Bai Yang's Dream

Silver moon, silver stars, silver weeping willows, silver plantain, silver grass… In this all-silver garden, Bai Yang, the heroine of "Crossroads," dressed in a 19th-century French girl's costume, exposing her snow-white shoulders and arms, innocently and happily sitting on a swing.

Her beloved, Zhao Dan (the hero of "Crossroads"), came. She smiled warmly and waved to Zhao Dan. Zhao Dan approached her, and the flames of love hidden in their hearts burned passionately, embracing tightly, kissing, kissing.

However, with the sound of a rooster crowing, Bai Yang's dream woke up. She was not in the silver garden, and her beloved Zhao Dan was nowhere to be seen. She felt disappointment and sadness.
