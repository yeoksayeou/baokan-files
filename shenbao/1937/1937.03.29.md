[Guangzhou] Huang Xuchu of Guilin telegraphed on the 28th that he will personally go to Hengyang to await Chairman Lin. Fellow Fujianese from Guilin have also sent representatives to Hengyang to welcome him. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Guangzhou] The Guangdong circles' welcome rally for Chairman Lin was held at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall at 3:00 PM on the 28th. More than ten thousand people, including Yu Hanmou, Xiang Hanping, Luo Zhuoying, Yu Junxian, Zeng Yangfu, and representatives from various circles, attended with great enthusiasm. Chairman Lin arrived at 3:00 PM, accompanied by Xiang Hanping. All provincial civil and military officials stood in front of the hall's square to welcome and support the chairman's entry into the memorial hall. The entire audience bowed three times to the chairman in the highest form of respect. After Yu Hanmou delivered a welcoming speech, Chairman Lin was invited to speak. The meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM. The Chairman's instructions are as follows: Fellow compatriots, I am very happy to be able to gather here with all of you today. I have been away from Guangzhou for many years. This time, in order to commemorate the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang, I have specially come to Guangzhou from Nanjing via the Yuehan Railway to pay my respects. As you all know, the Guangzhou Uprising on March 29th was launched by our party's martyrs in Guangzhou under the orders of the Premier to continue the revolution. Unfortunately, it failed, resulting in the heroic sacrifice of the seventy-two martyrs for the nation and the people. Although the uprising failed, it further shocked the national revolutionary sentiment, leading to the success of the Xinhai Revolution soon after. Therefore, it can be said that the uprising of March 29th was the impetus for the success of the Xinhai Revolution. If there had been no uprising of March 29th, there would have been no successful Wuchang Uprising of the Xinhai Revolution. Therefore, when we remember the revolutionary achievements of the martyrs, we must not forget the heroic sacrifice of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang for the country and the people. In order to honor the martyrs and commemorate their contributions to the country, we should enthusiastically hold memorial days for the martyrs to show our faith in worshipping the martyrs. Therefore, this year's commemoration of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang is being held on a larger scale for this reason. At the same time, this is also the reason for my visit to the South. We must know that Guangdong is the cradle of the revolution. Our compatriots in Guangdong, the cradle of the revolution, should make special efforts to promote and carry forward the revolutionary spirit and the revolutionary cause left to us by the martyrs and strive to complete it. I think the responsibility borne by the compatriots in the cradle of the revolution is relatively heavy. Many people say, "In the East, there is Confucius, and Confucius is our cultural mentor. Therefore, the responsibility borne by the people of Shandong for culture is more important than others." And Guangdong is the cradle of the revolution, Guangdong is the base for the Premier's advocacy of revolution, and the Premier is also the founding father of the Republic of China. Our compatriots in Guangdong, the birthplace of the founding father of the Republic of China, should take on special responsibility compared with other provinces to realize the unfinished revolutionary cause left to us by the Premier. The Premier told us, "The Three Principles of the People are the principles of national salvation. Our country today has reached such a critical moment. May I ask, should we not save the country? If we believe that we should save the country, then we must realize the Three Principles of the People." The Premier also told us to restore our nation's inherent morality and catch up with world culture." These two sentences are very simple in words, but their meaning is very great. In the midst of the serious national crisis, we should follow the Premier's teachings, strive to restore our nation's inherent morality, and accept various new sciences from the world, catch up with them, be of one heart and one mind, be sincerely united, and work hard for the future of China. There is hope. We must know that foreigners dare to bully us and invade us because we lack the power of unity. Everyone is like a heap of loose sand, so it has caused foreigners to bully us. If we want to save the country in the future, the first thing we must do is to unite, eliminate the old habits of disorganization, work together with one heart, be consistent from top to bottom, and the country's future can be turned from danger to safety. In particular, everyone should unanimously take out our blood and sweat money and strength to enrich our national defense, promote our production, and develop our construction, step by step, work hard, in order to achieve a rich and powerful situation. Today, I am very grateful for your warm welcome. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Yu Xuezhong and Yang Hucheng Pass Through Nanjing from Shaanxi and Go to Shanghai to Hangzhou

This trip is to meet with Chiang Kai-shek to report on the aftermath of the Xi'an Incident and the reorganization and redeployment of troops. Yang and Yu both made statements in Nanjing.

[Nanjing] Yu Xuezhong and Yang Hucheng, who were summoned by Chairman Chiang a few days ago, arrived from Xi'an on the morning of the 28th on the Euro-Asia No. 15 giant plane. Yu and others passed through Nanjing at 4:30 PM and landed at the Ming Palace Airport. Few people knew about it beforehand. Only Wang Shuchang, Vice President of the Military Council, Gao Bingfang, Director of the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Huang Yongxi, Director of the Gansu Provincial Government Office in Nanjing, went to the airport to welcome them. After the plane stopped, Yu Xuezhong got off the plane first, wearing a dark gray suit and looking energetic. He shook hands with the welcoming staff one by one and went to the Euro-Asia reception room to talk with Wang Shuchang for about half an hour. Yang Hucheng also came on the same plane, but no one knew it at first. Only Li Zhigang, a member of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, was seen coming on the same plane. He hurriedly went to the station to make a phone call. Soon, a man in a dark blue Zhongshan suit, with a tall and slender figure and wearing yellow leather shoes, was seen strolling with his hands behind his back next to the airport. An entourage was carrying a briefcase and staying close to him. It was Yang. When Yang came to Nanjing three years ago, his face was thinner, but now he is fatter than before. Those who saw him almost did not recognize him. A reporter asked Yang about the purpose of this trip. Yang smiled and said, "I will now take the same plane to Hangzhou. When I return to Nanjing, I will talk to you in detail. This time, I was summoned by Chairman Chiang to go to Hangzhou to meet with him and report on the aftermath of the Shaanxi Province and ask for instructions on everything. The aftermath of Shaanxi Province has been completed, and there is no problem in the Northwest now. The outside world still talks about the Northwest problem. This should be corrected. Now everyone agrees that it is necessary to support the leader and unify the national strength. Shaanxi Province has had a few bad years and has had poor harvests. The finances are also difficult, so the only problem at present is the financial problem, which still needs to be sorted out a little. After reporting to Chairman Chiang in Hangzhou, I will go to Nanjing to meet with President Yu and others. As for whether to visit Zhang Hanqing in Xikou, it will be decided after meeting with Chairman Chiang. As for the remaining bandits on the border of Shaanxi, they can also be resolved in the short term." Afterwards, Li Zhigang stepped forward and reported that he had called Minister He to report that he had passed through Nanjing. Yang handed over a written statement after finishing the conversation. This trip to the south is solely to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on the reorganization of the troops and the defense situation in accordance with the order. The troops have now been reorganized into two divisions. The former 17th Route Army Headquarters has been cancelled in accordance with the order, and the headquarters is also being reduced in size. In the Northwest, after Director Gu conveyed the Central Government's intentions and Chairman Chiang's great spirit of public loyalty and patriotism, the military and civilians were greatly inspired and further strengthened their support. Now that the country is unified, the only way to consolidate the Central Government and obey the leader is to achieve national salvation by resisting the enemy. Today, there is no so-called Northwest problem. The will and wishes of the military and civilians in the Northwest have been completely unified. They only know how to support the leader and defend against aggression. They will do their best to be loyal to anyone who is beneficial to the country. Before boarding the plane, Director Yu Xuezhong said that the various armies of Zhang and part of the troops under his command have reached the designated defense area in Anhui and Henan. The rest are still on the way. As of now, about half of the relocation has been completed. The troops under his command can be completely transferred to the east by the 10th of next month. The two cavalry divisions are still in their original defenses. Once the various troops are transferred to the east, the cavalry will also be transferred to the east immediately. The relocation should be completed completely within the next month. I came here this time after being summoned by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on the troop transfer and ask for instructions. After returning to Shaanxi, I will meet with Zhang Hanqing. After the troops have completely arrived at the new defense area, I will go to Bengbu and come to Nanjing again to meet with the central authorities. The local area of ​​Gansu is stable, but in the past, it was affected by drought. Although the agricultural harvest was good last year, there were more stationed troops, and the food was insufficient. As a result, the people of Gansu felt a great lack of food. It is planned to ask the central government and all parties to handle accounts and relief. At about 6:00 PM, after the plane stopped refueling, Yu and Yang shook hands with the welcoming staff and boarded the plane and flew to Shanghai one after another. The people on the same plane included Yu's secretary Sun Xiangqian, adjutant Han Fayao, Shaanxi Provincial Government member Li Zhigang, Yang's adjutant director Jia Wenyu, secretary Zhou Fanbai, and more than a dozen attendants. Li Jingcong, general manager of Euro-Asia Company, was also on the plane. (28th Dispatch)

[Nanjing] Yang Hucheng, Pacification Commissioner of Shaanxi Province, and Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, flew to Nanjing from Xi'an on the 28th afternoon at 4:30 PM on the Euro-Asia giant plane. Wang Shuchang, Vice President of the Military Council, Zheng Daoru, Secretary of the Executive Yuan, Gao Bingfang, Director of the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, Huang Dawei, Counselor of the Military Council, and Huang Yongxi, Director of the Gansu Provincial Government Office in Nanjing, all went to the airport to welcome them. After Yang and Yu got off the plane, Yang walked around the airport, while Yu went to the airport lounge with the welcoming staff to reminisce. Then at 5:00 PM, they took the original plane to Shanghai and then to Hangzhou to meet with Chairman Chiang for instructions. The staff who came with Yang and Yu included Li Zhigang, member of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, and secretaries Zhou Fanbai, Jia Wenyu, and adjutants. The staff also flew to Shanghai on the same plane. According to Director Yang, who spoke to the Central News Agency reporter at the airport, the purpose of this trip to the south was to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on the reorganization of the troops and the defense situation in accordance with the order. The troops have now been reorganized into two divisions. The former 17th Route Army Headquarters has been cancelled in accordance with the order, and the headquarters is also being reduced in size. In the Northwest, after Director Gu conveyed the Central Government's intentions and Chairman Chiang's great spirit of public loyalty and patriotism, the military and civilians were greatly inspired and further strengthened their sincere support. Now that the country is unified, the only way to consolidate the Central Government and obey the leader is to achieve national salvation by resisting the enemy. Today, there is no so-called Northwest problem. The will and wishes of the military and civilians in the Northwest have been completely unified. They only know how to support the leader and defend against aggression. They will do their best to be loyal to anyone who is beneficial to the country. Director Yang also said that the disaster situation in Shaanxi is very serious, and he hopes that the Central Government will allocate funds for relief. When I pass through Shanghai, I plan to visit the President to pay my respects. Whether I will go to Xikou to visit Mr. Zhang Hanxiang in the future will be decided after arriving in Hangzhou. Finally, Director Yang said that he originally intended to keep this trip a secret, but in the end, he was found out. He only has admiration for himself. According to Chairman Yu, who spoke to the Central News Agency reporter, he came here after being summoned by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to go to Hangzhou to listen to instructions and report on the troop transfer situation. Part of the old Northeast Army has arrived at the defense location designated by the Central Government, and part is still on the way. The 51st Army, which he leads, is also opening up to Shaanxi from Gansu. It will be transported eastward by Longhai train from Xianyang on the 10th of next month. As for the opening date and defense location of the two cavalry divisions under the jurisdiction of Army Commander He Zhuguo, he still needs to ask the Central Government for instructions. All the transfer matters of the old Northeast Army will be completed within the next month. Whether I will go to Xikou to visit Mr. Zhang Hanqing this time will have to wait until I arrive in Hangzhou. I plan to return to Shaanxi after finishing my business in Zhejiang, and then go to Bengbu for defense. Later, he said that Gansu was suffering from a strange disaster, and the people had difficulty in spring plowing. He came here to ask the Central Government to find a way to provide relief. As for the aftermath of Shaanxi and Gansu, Director Gu is responsible for handling it, and it is now in place. In the future, there will be no so-called Northwest problem. The only thing is that the whole country should be united, obey the Central Government, consolidate unity, and strive to resist the enemy and survive. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)

Current Commentary

### Future of Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation

— Du

The call for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation has surged once again since the arrival of the Kodama Kenji mission to China, creating quite a stir.  Anti-Japanese banquets have given way to reciprocal receptions, with toasts exchanged and hosts and guests alike enjoying themselves. Since the Mukden Incident, military power has been expanding and the atmosphere of war has been pervasive, leaving the thread of friendship between the two countries hanging by a mere thread. How fortunate that this group of business leaders, standing from a purely national standpoint and bearing the mission of conducting on-the-ground investigations, are seeking to promote economic cooperation and adjust the relationship between the two countries. Where opportunity lies, sincerity follows. Changing course is not inherently difficult. We, as a nation that deeply loves peace, certainly welcome them with heartfelt sincerity. Now that Kodama and his party have concluded their mission in Shanghai, they embarked on their return journey to Japan yesterday, intending to report the results of this trip to their countrymen. Whether economic cooperation will achieve a bright future and whether Sino-Japanese relations can transition to a smooth and peaceful path are matters of extreme concern to the people of our country. Let me venture a speculative analysis based on my limited perspective.

Our country is renowned throughout the world for its vast land and abundant resources. The fullness of its forests and mountains, and the richness of its mineral deposits are sufficient for self-sufficiency and to provide for others. Unfortunately, years of unrest have resulted in accumulated distress, with a lack of both technology and capital. Consequently, vast quantities of resources remain untapped. Should friendly foreign parties come seeking cooperation, willing to employ talent from Chu in Jin and jointly pursue development, we should certainly welcome them with open arms. However, at this juncture, there is one principle that must be adhered to: that is, the principle of mutual benefit and equality. Equality safeguards our sovereignty from decline, while mutual benefit lies in increasing the welfare of both parties. Even ordinary people entrusted with tasks understand this principle. How could it possibly be overlooked in international affairs? The British Ambassador, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, at a banquet of the Hong Kong Southwestern Club, once stated that only equality can foster friendship between China and Britain, and that they were very willing to assist in China's development in a spirit of cooperation. He seemed to deeply understand this point, which is why he spoke so earnestly. And Kodama Kenji, before embarking on his trip to China, also expressed extremely earnest sentiments. Firstly, he stated that in politics, they firmly respect China's territory and sovereignty. Secondly, he said that in economics, they strictly maintain mutual benefit and equality between the two countries. Only in this way, he argued, can one speak of cooperation, and only in this way can one expect improvement in the relationship between the two countries. Our desire for assistance is so earnest, and their sincerity in engaging with us is so thorough. Therefore, after this round of interactions, there should be no reason why we cannot achieve harmonious cooperation. However, since Kodama's arrival in Shanghai, the Japanese atmosphere has been rather pessimistic. Newspaper opinions have been largely dissatisfied, and Kodama's public statements have also seemed somewhat restrained. Is there an underlying reason for this?

We should be aware that while organizations in Beijing and Shanghai are enthusiastically welcoming the Japanese delegation, and while Kodama Kenji is delivering his amicable speeches with composure, what is being reflected in actions and facts elsewhere? Military departments are holding closed-door meetings, and staff officers and military attachés are rushing about making connections. This is one phenomenon. Rogue elements are stubbornly engaging in smuggling, customs officials are being beaten, and railway workers are being injured. This is another phenomenon. Who is behind these actions? Who is condoning them? While advocating for unified diplomacy, the actual discrepancies are so great. Can this be something that even Kodama and his group find difficult to explain? It is well said that Kato, a member of the delegation, stated in Tianjin, "The reason why we have been unable to break the deadlock is, in part, due to the North China issue. After the delegation returns home, based on the information we have gathered, we will sincerely inform the people of our country that they should consider the actual situation and properly handle the China policy." Therefore, the future of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation will depend on the efforts of the Kodama mission after they return home. There is no need for us to belabor the point further today.

### Japanese Prime Minister Hayashi to Invite Party Members into Cabinet

Minister to be Appointed to Railway and Colonial Affairs Portfolio, Atmosphere Between Political Parties and Military Reportedly Easing

[Tokyo] The positions of Minister of Education, Minister of Railways, and Minister of Colonial Affairs in the current cabinet remain vacant. It is rumored that Prime Minister Hayashi Senjuro will continue to concurrently hold the position of Minister of Education. As for the other two ministries, dedicated ministers will be selected from the Minseito and Seiyukai parties after the Diet adjourns on the 31st. When Hayashi Senjuro formed his cabinet, he rejected the inclusion of political party members due to the perceived antagonism between political parties and the military. However, since Yuki took office as Minister of Finance and Ikeda succeeded as President of the Bank of Japan, the Hayashi cabinet has been regarded as one where financial cliques and the military are mutually supportive. This sentiment is naturally reflected in the attitude of political parties. Although some members of the Minseito and Seiyukai parties have individually raised sharp questions during the Diet session, both parties have, in practice, supported the various important bills proposed by the government. Two weeks ago, Prime Minister Hayashi expressed the opinion that the antagonism between the military and political parties at the time of cabinet formation had greatly eased. This implied an invitation for members of political parties to fill the vacant ministerial posts. However, Hayashi Senjuro still hopes for the emergence of a new political party, namely the government party being contemplated by various parties, so that he can select dedicated ministers from among them. Recently, although many members of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties have been engaged in movements to form a new party, its realization has been delayed due to the slim hope of securing a majority of seats in the Diet. It is reported that Prime Minister Hayashi has now decided to select dedicated ministers for the Railways and Colonial Affairs ministries from the existing two parties in order to reduce the potential conflicts that may arise during the drafting of new and stronger policies after the Diet adjourns. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)

[Tokyo] Prime Minister Hayashi plans to actively proceed with strengthening the cabinet after the Diet adjourns, and to appoint ministers for Education, Railways, and Colonial Affairs in April. According to the Prime Minister, the positions of Minister of Railways and Minister of Colonial Affairs will be entrusted to figures from political parties, while the Minister of Education is expected to be found from the House of Peers. The government experienced various inconveniences in this Diet session due to the lack of communication with political parties. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to establish emotional ties with political parties before the next Diet session opens. Prime Minister Hayashi will likely begin negotiations with political parties from April onwards, requesting them to send representatives to join the cabinet. The results of this may have subtle repercussions on the political landscape due to its connection with the new party movement. The government's actions after the Diet adjourns are particularly noteworthy. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 28th)

### Only Three Days Remaining in Japanese Diet Session

Fifty-Three Bills Yet to be Voted On

[Tokyo] With only three days remaining in the current Diet session, only thirty of the eighty-three government bills have been passed by both houses. The remaining fifty-three bills remain stalled in both houses, with the prospects for the Farmland Act and the Iron and Steel Business Act, among others, appearing rather bleak. While the tariff amendment bill has some hope of passing after revisions, the future of the export control bill is uncertain due to the undecided attitude of the political parties. In light of this situation, the government has decided to urge both houses to expedite the deliberation of the various bills. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 28th)

[Tokyo] The central agenda items of the current Diet session, the general budget bill for the next fiscal year and the special account budget bill, passed the Budget Committee of the House of Peers on the 27th. They are scheduled to be submitted to the plenary session for discussion on the 29th and will be passed along with the supplementary budget bill. Furthermore, the six tax increase-related bills also passed the House of Peers on the 27th. Currently, the only budget-related issue awaiting resolution is the tariff bill. Although various difficulties have arisen due to the undecided revision policy for the export control bill, it is expected to pass the House of Representatives within a day or two. Thus, the Diet is gradually approaching a grand finale. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 28th)

### Soviet Air Force Can Bomb Tokyo in Three Hours

Mizuno Inquires in Japanese House of Peers

[Tokyo] The House of Peers convened at 10:30 AM today. The government submitted the bill to issue additional public bonds for Showa 12 (1937) and the amendment bill to the Bank of Japan Gold Purchase Law. After Finance Minister Ketsugi explained the reasons, they were entrusted to the Deficit Bond Committee. Next, the Air Defense Bill was submitted, and Interior Minister Kawarada explained the reasons. Yoshitsu Asada of the Koseikai posed four questions: First, why does the government not obligate the general public to participate in aviation duties? Second, does the military intend to command civilian air defense, and does it intend to requisition civilian aviation in the event of an emergency? Third, are there differences in command and supervision between peacetime air defense and wartime air defense? Fourth, is the formation of air defense solely under the supervision of the Interior Minister sufficient?

Interior Minister Kawarada replied that training is currently being conducted for the general public, but it is not mandatory. This bill limits obligations to those with special skills. All air defense that does not belong to the military is managed by this law. In the future, an Air Defense Ministry will be established to oversee air defense operations. Temporarily, the Ministry of Interior will oversee and liaise with various prefectural agencies to ensure thoroughness.

Army Minister Sugiyama replied that in the event of war and when necessary for national defense, civilian aviation will also be placed under the command of the air defense commander.

Next, Jinjiro Mizuno of the Koyukai took the floor and asked: It is said that the Soviet air force can reach Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka in three hours and conduct air raids. Although this bill aims to train civilian air defense, I sincerely hope that the army and navy will also strengthen their air forces.

Army Minister Sugiyama replied that the authorities are currently considering establishing a powerful aviation agency and are also planning to research methods to strengthen the air force with relevant ministries.

Navy Minister Yonai replied that strengthening the air force is currently an urgent task. Regarding the establishment of an Aviation Ministry, he intends to study the matter with various ministries. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 28th)

Battleships to be Equipped with Sixteen-Inch Guns; Britain and America Find Japan's Attitude Unremarkable

[Washington] According to an official announcement today, the United States will begin construction of two battleships this summer, equipped with sixteen-inch heavy guns. The United States already has three battleships equipped with sixteen-inch heavy guns: the Maryland, the Colorado, and the West Virginia. Japan's recent official rejection of the fourteen-inch gun limit is considered unremarkable here, and no official comments have been released. (Central News Agency dispatch, Reuters, 27th)

[Washington] Naval authorities here are maintaining strict secrecy regarding the gun caliber issue for the two new battleships and are unwilling to offer any criticism before Japan officially notifies its rejection of the fourteen-inch gun limit. However, it is said that if the Navy Department does not use nine sixteen-inch guns, it will use twelve fourteen-inch guns, divided into three rows of four guns each. This is a newly invented construction method. It is understood that naval officers favor using fourteen-inch guns to reduce weight and increase speed. However, the two ships were originally designed for a speed of only twenty-seven knots, so the Navy Department may adopt sixteen-inch guns, which remains uncertain. (National News Agency dispatch, 27th)

[Washington] The Japanese government has recently informed the British government that it rejects the fourteen-inch gun limit for battleships, but no notification has yet been received here. Naval circles, because news from Tokyo has been circulating for some time, stating that Japan is now planning to build battleships of 35,000 tons or more, even up to 50,000 tons, and equip them with sixteen-inch guns, are therefore not surprised by the news. Recently, naval authorities have studied the possibility of equipping 35,000-ton battleships with sixteen-inch guns. The results show that the range is not much different from that of fourteen-inch guns, while the latter is lighter. Therefore, naval experts generally favor fourteen-inch guns. (Central News Agency dispatch, Havas, 27th)

[London] Regarding the issue of the fourteen-inch gun limit for battleships stipulated in the Anglo-French-American naval treaty, the Japanese government has submitted a note to the British government rejecting this limit. British naval circles are commenting on this matter, recalling the statement made by First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Samuel Hoare in the House of Commons the other day, and stating that equipping 35,000-ton battleships with fourteen-inch guns can save weight and increase armor thickness, thereby strengthening the battleships' resistance to artillery fire. Conversely, if the gun caliber is increased, the armor must be thinned, which will affect its resistance to artillery fire. This is the reason why Britain supports fourteen-inch guns. According to news from Japan, the Japanese Navy Department is now planning to build battleships of 35,000 tons or more. If so, then Britain should also build battleships of 35,000 tons or more and equip them with sixteen-inch guns. (Central News Agency dispatch, Havas, 27th)

[London] The Admiralty announced today that Britain has begun building sixteen destroyers of 1,650 tons, with a speed of thirty-six knots. It is said that the ships will be equipped with six-inch and 4.7-inch guns. Eight of them are part of the 1936 construction plan, while the rest belong to this year's plan. A plan to add forty destroyers within two years has been approved. (National News Agency dispatch, 27th)

### American Workers Demand Recognition of Unions

Government Does Not Interfere in Labor Strife

[Washington] President Roosevelt has returned to the White House today after a two-week vacation at Warm Springs, preparing to immediately discuss labor issues with congressional leaders and hold meetings with the Judiciary Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives. (National News Agency dispatch, 27th)

[Washington] Senate Democratic Leader Robinson, after meeting with President Roosevelt today, released a statement here explaining the central government's attitude towards domestic strike incidents. He stated that the central government cannot interfere with the current sit-down strike because, according to the Constitution, the central government has no right to interfere with strikes unless 1) damage to central assets, 2) violation of central laws, or 3) a request for assistance from the state government to maintain law and order occurs. Since none of these developments have occurred, and the labor unrest is showing considerable progress, there is even less need for interference. (Central News Agency dispatch, Reuters, 28th)

[Washington] President Roosevelt, after resting for two weeks at Warm Springs, Georgia, has recently returned to Washington. He immediately contacted congressional leaders. Those he met with today included Speaker of the House Bankhead, House Democratic Leader Rayburn, Senate President (Vice President) Garner, and Senate Democratic Leader Robinson. The President also met with Labor Secretary Perkins to discuss the labor unrest issue. Regarding this matter, the President has no intention of proposing new legislation. Political figures are paying close attention to the issue of striking workers occupying factory buildings. Some congressmen, due to the unevenness of existing state laws, intend to ask the federal Congress to pass new legislation to standardize them. However, many are still concerned that the Supreme Court may use the pretext of infringing on the legislative powers of the states and consider it a violation of the Federal Constitution. Therefore, the country's attention is focused on the Supreme Court reorganization bill previously proposed by the President as a fundamental solution. Regarding this point, officials have recently stated that the President prefers to wait for a clear expression of national opinion and does not want to urge Congress to submit it for discussion. (Central News Agency dispatch, Havas, 27th)

Detroit: The most recent development in the "sit-down strike" wave in the American automobile industry is the request by the United Automobile Workers (UAW) to the court to order the Chrysler factory to recognize the UAW as the sole bargaining agent for negotiations with employees. According to the Wagner Labor Relations Act, any factory where the number of union members among the employees constitutes a majority can serve as the sole representative agency for the workers. UAW members account for an absolute majority of Chrysler factory employees. Therefore, based on this law, they have requested the court to order the Chrysler factory not to violate it. However, the US Supreme Court is still considering the legality of the Wagner Act itself. (Central News Agency dispatch, Reuters, 27th)

### Labor Unrest in Malaya May Be Resolved

Many Chinese Coal Miners Return to Work

Kuala Lumpur: There is a good sign that the labor unrest in Malaya may be generally resolved. Six thousand Chinese workers at the Batu Arang coal mine have mostly returned to work today after an agreement to establish a 10% wage increase. The troops dispatched to the area after a clash on Friday are expected to be withdrawn tomorrow. Many of the strikers at the Nilgiri Sembilan rubber estate have indicated their willingness to return to work under police protection. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)

### Two Thousand Workers Strike at Scottish Armaments Factory

Glasgow: Two thousand machine workers at the Bette More Company have decided to strike today, leading to the suspension of the Admiralty's shipbuilding program. The workers' demand is for a wage increase of one penny per hour. (National News Agency dispatch, 27th)

### Non-Intervention in Spanish Civil War Land and Sea Monitoring Plan Gradually Takes Effect

British and French Navies Prepare to Provide Backup; French Warship Intercepts Volunteers for First Time

[London] French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos held talks with British Ambassador to France Sir Eric Phipps on the 25th of this month, mutually explaining the positions that Britain and France should adopt on the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, and discussing various measures to intercept foreign volunteers continuing to head to Spain and prevent them from landing in that country. However, it is generally believed here that the task of the navy implementing surveillance measures should be limited to proving that the non-intervention agreement has been violated, and should not hastily engage in interception to avoid causing serious incidents. The authorities of both countries actively consulted again today, and it is reported that agreement has been reached on the following four points:

1.  Britain and France have no discrepancies in their opinions on the Spanish issue.
2.  Regarding the violation of the non-intervention agreement, there is currently no news sufficient to absolutely convince one that it is true.
3.  However, if it is proven in the future that the non-intervention agreement has indeed been violated, Britain and France will always consider the situation "extremely serious."
4.  Britain and France will continue to exchange views continuously. (Central News Agency dispatch, Havas, 27th)

[London] According to views from influential sources in London, no violations of the agreement have occurred since the establishment of the Non-Intervention Committee's ban on volunteers going to Spain. The claim that certain countries intend to violate it is also unbelievable. The Monitoring Committee has now begun work to make the agreement effective, and both Britain and France intend to make its work effective in the shortest possible time. Therefore, there is currently no need to take other steps to prevent volunteers from going to Spain, nor are there any recommendations. (Central News Agency dispatch, Reuters, 28th)

[Rome] The semi-official Italian newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia recently reported that the Italian government had recently provided assurances to Britain regarding its attitude towards the Spanish issue, stating that Italy had no intention of sending troops to Spain. The British cabinet was aware of this assurance during its cabinet meeting on the 24th of this month. The next day, French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos met with British Ambassador to France Sir Eric Phipps and suggested that Britain and France cooperate to prevent foreign volunteers from going to Spain, but Britain did not accept. This is the reason. According to general opinion, the assurance mentioned by Il Giornale d'Italia was likely the one given by Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano to British Ambassador Sir Eric Drummond during their meeting on the 22nd of this month. (Central News Agency dispatch, Havas, 27th)

[London] A spokesman for the Italian Embassy here today denied that Italy had reiterated its assurance to Britain that it would not send more troops to Spain, and solemnly stated that Italy had already banned troops from going to Spain in accordance with the international neutrality agreement. If there were additional assurances, it would cause one to doubt the sincerity of Italy's previous ban. This point should be clarified. British officials have confirmed Italy's denial, stating that "the Daily Telegraph's claim that Italy had assured Britain that it would prohibit volunteers from going to Spain and expressed its readiness to discuss the withdrawal of foreign troops from the ranks of the Spanish rebels is purely fabricated." At the same time, it is understood that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has instructed Ambassador Grandi to refuse to discuss the withdrawal of volunteers already in Spain, and there has been no change. Today, a spokesman for the Italian Embassy also stated that Grandi's rejection of discussions on this issue had already produced the current result. However, after two weeks or a month, it may be possible to discuss it. Italy has complied with the agreement and prohibited troops from going to Spain, and Britain has no reason to assume that Italy intends to violate the non-intervention agreement. The Times of London commented on this matter with much sarcasm, saying that now that new Italian volunteers are ready to depart, everyone knows it, so everyone here feels that Rome has violated the neutrality agreement. The Manchester Guardian also made similar statements, saying, "The war in Spain is no longer a civil war. The future status of the western Mediterranean has become a problem, and this is where the crisis lies." (National News Agency dispatch, 27th)

[Paris] Today, a French warship officially used force to implement the non-intervention agreement, preventing volunteers from going to Spain. The intercepted ship was a French merchant ship carrying twenty-five volunteers, including several Americans. After learning of this, the French warship fired a shot at the ship, ordering it to return to Port Vendres and hand over the volunteers to the police. (National News Agency dispatch, 27th)

Perpignan: Among the twenty-five volunteers intercepted yesterday by the coast guard vessel "Serbel" on the ship "Incomparable" were thirteen Americans, five Canadians, three Hungarians, two Irishmen, and two Romanians. All carried American passports, which had been signed by the French Consul General in New York. The Consul General had added a note stating that the passport was not valid for Spain. The volunteers stated that they wished to travel to Spain for tourism and not to participate in the war. (Central News Agency dispatch, Havas, 28th)

### Easter Mass Held at the Vatican

The Pope Personally Blesses Believers - Spain Enacts Holy Truce

Vatican City - This morning, a Papal Mass was held at St. Peter's Basilica. Approximately 60,000 believers attended, including a large number of foreigners. The diplomatic section was also full, though no personnel from the German Embassy in the Holy See were present. Pope Pius XI also attended; this was his first public appearance since his illness. Many believers rushed inside as soon as the basilica doors opened in the early morning, eager to take their seats and await the Pope's arrival. When the Pope entered from the rear of the basilica, the crowd erupted in cheers, shouting "Long live the Pope!" The Pope, dressed in his vestments, ascended the throne and raised his right hand to bless the believers, entrusting Cardinal Tisserant with conducting the Mass. At that time, over 200,000 people were still outside the basilica in the square. A giant loudspeaker was used to broadcast the service. At 12:30 PM, the Pope reappeared on the balcony to bless the crowd in the square. The crowd cheered upon seeing him, and the Pope was so moved that he wept. He then withdrew inside. (Havas, Central News Agency, 28th)

[Paris] Despite many Parisians leaving the capital for the Easter holiday, masses were held in all churches. A constant stream of believers attended. At Notre Dame Cathedral, Cardinal Verdier of the Paris diocese personally conducted the Papal Mass, which was particularly well-attended. A continuous flow of foreigners came to visit the sights. All major thoroughfares and historical sites were thronged with tourists. The cafes and hotels were also full. (Havas, Central News Agency, 28th)

[Berlin] Heavy snow continued here this morning, preventing the usual Easter religious processions from taking place. Several excursions were canceled. Most people preferred to stay in the city due to the heavy snowfall rather than take trips to the countryside. As a result, movie theaters and playhouses were packed. In addition, a textile exhibition also attracted many people. On Monday, the French and German national soccer teams will compete. (National Telegram, 28th)

Gibraltar - The Spanish southern port of Malaga held a religious procession yesterday, Good Friday. At that time, a warship outside the port opened fire, shelling the area for half an hour. Three people were killed and many were injured. It is generally believed that the ship was the government cruiser "Jaime I." (Havas, Central News Agency, 27th)

[London] The Sunday papers have commented on the Spanish Civil War, stating that the Easter "holy truce" and the planned land border surveillance in Spain are stabilizing factors for the European situation. The Times commented on the close cooperation between England and France, stating, "According to information from responsible sources here, there is no discrepancy in the views of England and France, and this is also the case on the border." The Observer reported, "The real problem lies within the Adjustment Committee. Internal strife among the member countries of the committee has begun to resurface." In reality, the most urgent matter is the swift implementation of the land border surveillance plan in Spain. "If the member countries of the Adjustment Committee remain divided, this surveillance plan cannot be realized." The French government's moderate approach is commendable.

### French Ship Attacked in Spanish Waters

Carrying Chinese Laborers and a Secretary from the Embassy

Marseilles - The French shipping company Chargeurs Réunis' passenger ship "Emile Littre" arrived here at 10:30 this morning after being attacked yesterday by the Spanish rebel cruiser "Canarias" off the coast of Alicante. A large crowd of citizens waited at the docks. Police immediately boarded the ship to check passports. There were 436 refugees, 23 Chinese laborers, 48 members of the rebel militia, and a secretary from the Chinese Embassy in Spain, traveling on this ship to France. (Havas, Central News Agency, 28th)

### British Parliament Member Proposes Salary Increase

To £500

[London] Prime Minister Baldwin recently submitted a bill to Parliament requesting that the annual salary of cabinet ministers be increased to £5,000 and the Prime Minister's salary to £10,000. Regarding this matter, some members of the House of Commons are now advocating for an increase in the salaries of lower house members as well. According to the Evening Standard, many in the House of Commons are requesting an increase to £500. Currently, members of the lower house receive an annual salary of only £400 and free travel to and from their constituencies and London. They do not enjoy any other benefits.

### Indian People's Party Refuses to Cooperate with Government

Provincial Governments Unable to Form - Concrete Expression of Opposition to the Constitution

New Delhi - In provinces where the People's Party holds a majority in recent provincial assembly elections, difficulties have arisen in forming provincial governments because the governors refuse to guarantee that they will not exercise the special powers granted to them under the new constitution. After the leader of the Bombay People's Party refused to form a provincial government, the leader of the Madras People's Party has also refused to accept government positions. The leader of the Orissa People's Party has telegraphed the governor, stating that the chances of forming a provincial government are now slim. Nehru, the general secretary of the People's Party, commented on these developments, saying that he is very pleased with the current trend and that the People's Party intends to proceed in this manner so that the constitution will soon come to an end. The Governor of Bombay Province, Lord Brabourne, also issued a statement today, saying that although he is willing to waive the obligations stipulated in the Government of India Act, he does not have the authority to do so. However, he has assured the leaders of the People's Party that if they form a government, they will receive all possible assistance, sympathy, and cooperation within the scope of the law. He expressed regret over the People's Party's decision to refuse to form a provincial government, but said that the People's Party's demands are difficult to fulfill under the constitution, so the People's Party must bear the responsibility for insisting on their demands. Other groups are now attempting to form a coalition government in light of the People's Party's decision. It is reported that Sir Abdoola Haroon, the leader of the All-India Muslim Federation, will meet with the governor tomorrow. (Special Dispatch, Tzu Lin Pao, 27th)

### Near East Nations to Sign Treaty

Final Obstacle to Be Resolved

[Berlin] According to a special Cairo dispatch in the Berliner Tageblatt, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan will soon sign a treaty. After this treaty is signed, these four countries will become a strong bloc. According to the Turkish Foreign Minister, the treaty will be signed in the Iraqi capital, and the King of Iraq has expressed his support. The report goes on to say that two years ago, Iraq refused to participate in such a Near East alliance, but since the military coup in Iraq and the reconciliation with England, it has apparently decided on a new policy direction, and this is why England supports the signing of this treaty. It is generally believed in Iraq that the final obstacle to signing the treaty, namely the border dispute between Iraq and Iran, will soon be resolved. (National Telegram, 27th)

### Italian Foreign Minister to Visit Turkish Capital

To Conclude Friendship Treaty

[Rome] Foreign Minister Count Ciano, having completed the signing of a political and economic agreement in the Yugoslav capital, returned home by plane today. He arrived here at 2:45 PM and went immediately to pay his respects to Prime Minister Mussolini and report to him. (Havas, Central News Agency, 27th)

[Rome] Foreign Minister Count Ciano returned to Rome this afternoon and immediately paid his respects to Prime Minister Mussolini to report on his visit to the Yugoslav capital. Political figures say that Count Ciano's trip to Ankara, the Turkish capital, at the end of April now seems certain. But they point out that Ciano must wait until the Turkish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister reciprocate the visit to Yugoslavia before he can make the trip, as it is believed here that the Turkish Prime Minister's negotiations in Yugoslavia are a precursor to Italian-Turkish negotiations, which are extremely important for Mediterranean policy.

### British Independent Labour Party Annual Conference

Attacks Monarchical System

[London] The Independent Labour Party recently held its annual conference in Glasgow, Scotland. MP Maxton delivered a speech, vehemently attacking the British monarchical system. He described the abdication of Edward VIII, saying, "The impression this matter made on the public was extremely commonplace, which shows that the people do not care about the monarchical system, and what we see is indeed correct. The abdicated king was the most beloved and greatest monarch in this country, but he was dismissed like a servant, and another servant could be summoned to replace him within 24 hours. This situation can be clearly seen in the actions of Prime Minister Baldwin and the National Government." Maxton then appealed to the Labour Party, advocating that all left-wing parties should form a united front. He also mentioned the Labour Party Executive Committee's expulsion of the party's left-wing leader, Sir Stafford Cripps, saying, "We cannot accept this decision of the Labour Party Executive Committee as final, but we must ask Labour Party members to express their opinions responsibly." (Havas, Central News Agency, 27th)

### British Treasury Allocates Agricultural and Industrial Subsidies

[London] Before Parliament adjourned on Thursday, the Treasury Department answered a question from a member of the House of Commons, saying that from October 1931 to the end of this month, the Treasury has allocated a total of £38,786,000 in subsidies to British agriculture and industry, distributed as follows: sugar beet £17,720,000, livestock £9,921,400, milk £4,996,400, herring £78,800, general shipping £3,998,300, civil aviation £2,018,200, mechanical transport £13,300.

### Czech Prime Minister Visits Austrian Prime Minister

In-Depth Discussion of Various Issues - Austrian Prime Minister to Visit Italy Early Next Month

[Vienna] Czech Prime Minister Hodža, visiting Austria in a private capacity, paid a visit to Prime Minister Schuschnigg yesterday afternoon, holding talks that lasted until the evening. It is reported that the two engaged in an in-depth discussion of various issues. Well-informed sources say that the Czech Prime Minister's visit to Austria was conceived more than a month ago and was not caused by recent diplomatic activities in Central Europe and the Balkans. Furthermore, Prime Minister Schuschnigg's frequent interactions with key figures in the Czech and Hungarian authorities should not be seen as evidence of the imminent collapse of the Danube countries' alliance. Responsible sources believe that the current cooperation between Austria and other countries will be maintained, which is undoubtedly certain. The Rome Protocols between Italy, Austria, and Hungary recognize that Austria can cooperate with its neighboring countries within reasonable limits, so Prime Minister Schuschnigg is skillfully using flexible means to achieve closer ties with the Czech Republic, which does not conflict with the Rome Protocols. In addition, Schuschnigg recently published an article in Die Welt, firmly stating that Austria is unwavering in its adherence to existing treaties and that Austria's own fate should be decided by itself. This article, published after the meeting with Hodža, is noteworthy. (Havas, Central News Agency, 27th)

[Vienna] The date of Prime Minister Schuschnigg's visit to Italy to meet with Prime Minister Mussolini is reported to be in early April, but the exact date has not yet been determined. An Austrian economic delegation is scheduled to go to Rome in mid-April to hold new economic talks with Italian authorities on a broad basis. (Havas, Central News Agency, 27th)

Vienna

It is stated here that Prime Minister Schuschnigg will visit Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in the near future (early April) to discuss Austria's attitude towards the German-Italian axis. According to sources here, Austria seems to be showing a tendency to distance itself from the German-Italian axis due to its desire for independence and freedom, as stated by semi-official figures. The Vienna Newspaper's Easter Special issue contained a key article on this subject, written by Prime Minister Schuschnigg. It briefly stated that Austria must have independence and freedom in order to solve all problems. It went on to say that Germany is planning to send a business delegation to Rome in mid-April to conduct new negotiations. (National Telegram, 27th)

[Moscow] The government has decided to establish the "Soviet Institute of Geology," tasking it with collecting and studying various solid, liquid, and gaseous mineral products. (Havas, Central News Agency, 28th)

### The Truth About the Cang County Incident

Armed Koreans Smuggled Goods and Fired on Our Police - Provincial Government Investigation Confirms No Responsibility

Baoding Correspondence - Since the resolution of the Fengtai Incident last year, although there have been occasional disturbances by Japanese ruffians in Hebei Province, the authorities have always managed to resolve them in a timely manner. However, recently, an incident occurred involving armed Japanese ruffians smuggling goods and clashing with the security police in Cang County. The details of the incident are as follows:

The Occurrence of the Incident - The incident occurred around 1:00 PM on March 11th when several security police officers from Cang County were patrolling in the Jiuzhou area of the county. They saw two suspicious-looking trucks carrying goods coming from the west. They immediately ordered them to stop for inspection, but the trucks ignored the order and sped past. The security police then fired at the tires to stop them from proceeding. The Koreans on the trucks also opened fire and began shooting. At this point, the police officers, acting in self-defense, had no choice but to take cover by the roadside and return fire. After about an hour of exchanging fire, the smugglers surrendered. Upon inspection, the police found that three Koreans had been injured by mistake. They also found 28 bags of smuggled white sugar in the trucks, proving that they were engaged in armed smuggling. The injured Koreans and the smuggled sugar were handed over to the Cang County Commissioner's Office. One of the injured Koreans died due to the severity of his injuries. The other two injured Koreans were sent to the hospital by the Commissioner's Office and are no longer in critical condition.

The Provincial Government's Handling - After the incident, Li Guojun, the magistrate of Cang County and concurrent Administrative Inspector of the 7th District, telegraphed the provincial government to report the truth of the matter. After receiving the report, the provincial government, in order to understand the details, specially dispatched Japanese language advisor Chen Qingyun to Cang County to investigate everything. It is reported that Chen has completely investigated and clarified the details of the incident and has taken several photos of the scene. He has returned to the province to report. The provincial government believes that it has been determined that this incident was indeed caused by illegal smuggling by Japanese ruffians, and the security police were acting in self-defense, which was appropriate. In addition to ordering Li Guojun to handle the matter according to the law, the provincial government also instructed Li to explain the true situation to the Japanese side when they send personnel to investigate, so that the Japanese side can understand the truth. As for the rumors that the Japanese side intends to lodge a protest with the provincial government, the provincial government has not yet received any official communication from the Japanese side and believes that if the Japanese side investigates the situation thoroughly, there will be no need to lodge a protest, as the Koreans' injuries and death were their own fault.

The Japanese Side's Investigation - The Japanese consulate in Tianjin reportedly sent personnel to investigate after the incident. Japanese newspapers in Tianjin and Beijing have repeatedly stated that the Japanese side is taking the matter seriously and that the Japanese side intends to formally lodge a protest with the provincial government and, under the pretext of this incident, demand the establishment of a Japanese police station in Cang County. All of this is Japanese propaganda. The provincial government believes that this incident was caused by armed smuggling by Japanese ruffians. Local police officers have the responsibility to protect the area and assist in combating smuggling. Their mistake in injuring the Japanese ruffians while performing their duties was purely a display of dedication and responsibility. If the Japanese side lodges a protest due to a misunderstanding of the truth, the provincial government will definitely state everything according to reason. (March 27th)

### Traitor Shao Hanqing Still Secretly Negotiating the Sale of Reclaimed Salt Flats

A Merchant from a Certain Country Using the Pretext of Perpetual Lease to Purchase Land In and Around Tianjin

Tianjin Correspondence - There are over 80,000 acres of abandoned reclaimed salt flats in the Hangu and Xinhe areas east of Tianjin. Under the instigation of the traitor Yin Rugeng, Shao Hanqing has been selling them to a certain party. People here are paying close attention to this matter, as it involves the sale of national territory. Shao Hanqing is still in a certain concession in Tianjin, negotiating with the other party, but he is acting very secretly to avoid attracting attention, as the matter has not yet reached the stage of signing a contract. Shao Hanqing recently claimed that he is not the representative of the seller and that although there is another representative of the land owner, they are only forming a paper mill company with foreign merchants (referring to the certain party) and there is absolutely no sale of land. His words are very vague and difficult to believe. In addition to sending personnel to investigate the truth and report it to the Ministry of Finance for verification, the Changlu Salt Transport Envoy Office, based on the petitions from salt flat households in the Hangu and Xinhe areas, sent a special representative to Beijing on the morning of the 26th to explain everything to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. The Hangu and Xinhe areas are under the jurisdiction of Tianjin and Ninghe counties. The Tianjin Municipal Government has ordered the Tianjin District Administrative Commissioner's Office and the Tangda Police Bureau to thoroughly investigate the truth of the case of selling national territory so that it can negotiate to stop it. According to Tianjin Municipal Government Secretary-General Ma Yanchong, "In recent years, merchants from a certain country have been perpetually leasing a lot of land inside and outside the city. There are already several places in the Special First and Fourth Districts (former German and Belgian concessions). Now, merchants from a certain country want to expand the tactic of perpetually leasing land to the Tianjin and Dagukou areas. Foreign merchants are allowed to perpetually lease land in commercial port areas for industrial and commercial purposes, but it is questionable whether the example of commercial ports can be applied to areas outside commercial ports and whether foreign merchants can be allowed to perpetually lease land. The Municipal Government has requested instructions from the Central Government and has reported the details here for verification."

### Grain Merchants in Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi Oppose Guangdong's Exemption of Taxes on Imported Rice

Appointed Representatives to Gather in Beijing to Petition the Central Government - Agricultural and Grain Associations in Wuhan to Meet to Discuss Response

Hankou Correspondence - Regarding the rice shortage in Guangdong Province, the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui have been supplying it as much as possible, and special rice trains have been running on the Yuehan Railway. Although the rice shortage has not been completely resolved, it has been slightly alleviated due to the assistance of the provinces. During this period, the rumor that Guangdong Province would completely exempt import taxes on foreign rice suddenly became widespread, causing alarm among grain merchants in Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi. They decided to appoint representatives to gather in Beijing on the 30th to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry to stop it. Grain merchants in Shanghai are also participating in the appeal. In order to vigorously fight this case, the Wuhan Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Industry Association and the Agricultural Association also convened a joint meeting on the 27th and resolved the following: 1. The associations will jointly appoint representatives to go to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and ask Huang Wenzhi to accompany the bureau to petition the provincial and municipal governments, and ask the provincial and municipal governments to telegraph the Central Government to stop the exemption as soon as possible. 2. The grain merchants will jointly appoint three representatives to go to Beijing to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance. Huang Yunxiang, Bao Junan, and Xie Qianmao were appointed as the representatives to go to Beijing to petition. After the meeting, Agricultural Association representatives Lin Yaoqin and Han Qinnyu, grain industry representatives Li Bingjun and Deng Xizhou, and grain store representatives Huang Yunxiang, Chen Shulin, Dai Yongzhao, Yao Weizhang, Bao Junan, Hu Zuliang, and Yu Qisheng invited Municipal Chamber of Commerce Chairman Huang Wenzhi to visit Huang Shaohong, urging him to telegraph the Central Government to stop the exemption. The representatives to Beijing, Huang Yunqing and others, took the Longan Wheel to Beijing on the evening of the 27th. At the same time, they telegraphed President Jiang of the Executive Yuan and the national press to appeal. The text of the telegram to President Jiang of the Executive Yuan is as follows: "We have learned that last year, the provinces along the Yangtze River had bumper harvests, while Guangdong Province reported a rice shortage. The government, weighing surpluses and deficits, adjusted food supplies. It is appropriate to use the surplus rice production from the Yangtze River to supplement the grain shortage in Guangdong Province. In one transfer, not only can the southern famine be alleviated, but the four provinces in central China can also share the benefits and increase prosperity. However, some officials and merchants in Guangdong Province have failed to see this and have only requested tax exemptions on foreign rice. They do not know that if foreign rice is exempted from taxes, rice prices will inevitably plummet, leading to the farmers being harmed by cheap grain. Farmers across the country will inevitably suffer cruel sacrifices. Moreover, when deficits increase and taxes decrease, the massive import of foreign rice will inevitably increase the trade deficit and affect the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund. The consequences are unimaginable. The Association, seeing this, telegraphed Your Excellency and the Ministries of Finance and Industry on New Year's Day, pleading our case. We then received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance stating that the Guangdong Province is currently allowed to pay half of the tax on imported foreign rice in cash and record the other half in an account, and has not been exempted from taxes. The merchants should purchase as much domestic rice as possible and transport it to Guangdong for relief. The Association immediately called on the Wuhan industry to purchase as much rice as possible and transport it to Guangdong, and so far, more than 600,000 dan has been transported, and more than one million dan is still waiting to be transported. During this period of congested cargo transportation, it was suddenly reported that the Ministry of Finance in Guangdong Province intended to exempt the remaining tax on imported foreign rice. According to a telephone call from the Association's Guangzhou branch, the foreign rice tax exemption will be implemented on the 1st of next month. The news spread, and rice prices immediately fell. The impact will not only leave millions of dollars of the Association's industry's capital in despair, but also the rural prosperity of central China will be lost. Thinking of Your Excellency's concern for people's livelihood and consideration for farmers and merchants, the methods for adjusting food supplies and overall planning have long been discussed and decided, and will never be changed halfway. We urge you to strictly prohibit the tax exemption on foreign rice based on existing cases, telegraph it to stop it, and order the Guangdong Provincial Government to strictly prohibit rumors, maintain rice prices, so that a large amount of domestic rice will not be rejected for no reason, and the rural finance of the four provinces in central China will not collapse again. Sincerely presented, we await your orders. The Wuhan Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Industry Association."

### Shandong Provincial Government Plans to Develop the Taian Huabao Coal Mine

The mine can produce a thousand tons per day and be mined for thirty years. The provincial government plans to build a railway to facilitate transportation. Dakou will become the economic center of southern Shandong.

Jinan Communication: South of Taian County, there is the Huabin Coal Mine, which has been mined for more than twenty years. Due to small capital and low output, it has not attracted outside attention. In addition, it is too far from the Jinpu Railway, making transportation difficult and increasing costs, resulting in little hope for external development. Recently, operations have been stalled due to disagreements among shareholders. Coincidentally, the provincial government initiated the establishment of the Shandong Industrial Company, planning to jointly operate by the government and private sectors, raising 20 million yuan to develop industries and increase local production. Therefore, it planned to take over the mine and expand its operations. The Construction Department dispatched technician Yu Wudan to conduct a survey. The results showed great potential. The provincial government then sent Yu to organize a management office, with Yu serving as the director, and the takeover has been completed. The quality of the coal is very good, containing 12% sulfur, with high calorific value, suitable for steelmaking, and is one of the best in the country. The reserves are also very deep. In the past twenty years, due to improper management, only seventy or eighty tons were produced daily. According to accurate estimates, if the daily output reaches 1,000 tons in the future, it can be mined for thirty years. However, to continue mining, the first priority should be to facilitate transportation in order to develop externally. The provincial government has now decided to build a railway to meet this need. The Jinpu Railway passes through Taian, tens of miles away from the mine. If a branch line is built from Qiyao Station between Dakou and Nanyi, passing through Tianjiayuan, Dongciyao, Jingquanzhuang, Beigucheng, Xihanzhuang, Poguo, Taipingzhuang, Yanzhuang, and Nanyucun, to Huabao Coal Mine, the total length will be 40 Chinese miles. The estimated cost is about 800,000 yuan. In the future, it is planned to extend eastward, passing through Gongguo, Guli, to Suncun. If it is extended further, it can reach Mengyin County via Wennan. This section is about 50 Chinese miles long. If this road is completed, not only will Huabin Coal Mine benefit, but also the Huafeng Coal Mine north of Dongciyao and the Xinyu Coal Mine in Suncun will benefit. Developing the treasures of southern Shandong, this road has great economic value. Dakou is originally a distribution center for local products in southern Shandong. With this railway, it can further control the economic center of southern Shandong. It is reported that Yu Wudan recently plans to go to Beijing to discuss everything with the Ministry of Railways.

Doctor Rapes Female Opium Smoker

Hua Guojun, a resident of Maoziqiao in the northern countryside of our county, has been working in the education field. His eldest daughter, Jinglan, 26 years old, graduated from the Provincial No. 2 Women's Normal School. Several years ago, she married someone surnamed Guo and has a daughter, 4 years old. However, Jinglan suffered from hysteria during childbirth due to physical weakness and fetal gas. When someone told her that opium could cure it, she smoked a little, and her symptoms improved. When the government handled the self-renewal registration for opium smokers, Jinglan changed her name to Guo Zixin and obtained a self-renewal license from the county government. On September 26 last year, Jinglan was again summoned to the county rehabilitation center for treatment. She was discharged from the hospital on October 9 after quitting. On the 27th of last month, Jinglan went to the rehabilitation center for examination according to law. However, Zheng Fuxu, a doctor at the center, saw that she was beautiful and became lustful. That night, he tiptoed into Jinglan's room to attempt rape. After she called for help, she was not defiled. Zheng said hatefully, "I will send you to court tomorrow." On the 23rd of this month, he accused Jinglan of possessing poison and sent her to the county government. Jinglan publicly stated in the waiting room of the county government the inside story of the rehabilitation center and the attempted rape by doctor Zheng Fuxu, and sent a letter to her father, Hua Guojun, for instructions. The news spread, causing a sensation in society. Jinglan was then sent to the security headquarters of the district. After a detailed interrogation by military judge Li, Jinglan truthfully confessed. The military judge ordered her to submit a supplementary statement so that the matter could be investigated. Jinglan's father learned of the situation and submitted a petition to the special commissioner's office, requesting a thorough investigation. The county government believed that the truth of the case should be thoroughly investigated and sent the head of the first section, Li Shou Xuan, the head of the second section, Huang Fu, and the head of the third section, Xu Yingtu, to the county rehabilitation center to investigate the truth for verification. In addition, the county anti-smoking association has reported the information to the provincial anti-smoking association. It is reported that the doctor has been in office for one year, and attempted to rape Ms. Wang for the first time, raped Wang Suzhen for the second time, raped Gu Jingou for the third time, and attempted to rape Hua Jinglan for the fourth time. There are as many as thirteen people who have been raped. The district headquarters has issued a warrant to detain the principal offender, doctor Zheng, for legal action.

### Changzhou

Villagers and Refugees Brawl

Between Baiwen Town and Weicunling in the fourth district of Wu County, there are more than 100 refugees from Hubei who have been eating vegetarian food at the home of Xu Jindao, the richest man in Xujiagang Village. Xu also solicited white rice from his neighbors on their behalf. At this time, more than ten refugees freely entered and exited his house. Later, the Xu family discovered that more than 80 yuan hidden beside the pillow had disappeared. They reported to the town chief, Wang Zikang, and asked him to find a way to recover the money. After persuasion, fearing an accident, he let it go. Unexpectedly, this was known to unscrupulous people who gathered more than a hundred people to chase after the refugees. Knowing that things were not good, the refugees rushed to the farmers' homes to seize agricultural tools. At Jiutiangou, the two sides fought each other. Although the police station in Weicun sent police to suppress the fight, they could not stop it, resulting in the death of a refugee named Chen Desheng on the spot, and more than ten people were injured on both sides. Afterwards, the refugee representative, Chen Yiren, led the injured to the local court on the 27th to examine the injuries and requested that someone be sent to the countryside to examine the body.

### Letter

To the Chief Editor of Shen Bao,

With utmost respect, I have read the article "Banpu Communication" in your newspaper, which states that the Lianghuai Transportation Department and the Audit Branch Office of Banpu are soliciting merchants to contract for the Anhui-Henan shore loading and storage supervision project for the 26th year. The article mentions that in February of the 25th year, the Lianghuai Transportation Department announced the measures for the shore loading and storage supervision and tax payment to solicit merchants to contract. At that time, a few so-called old merchants failed to achieve their desire to monopolize the contracting and fabricated criticisms in the name of the Transportation Merchants Association. After reading this, I was deeply shocked and surprised. This association is organized by all colleagues. Every matter is decided by the general meeting of all members. There is no distinction between new and superior merchants. The merits and demerits of the dispute over shore loading and storage supervision have their own fixed evaluation and do not need to be elaborated. However, all matters are listed under the names of individual transportation merchants, which can be verified. This association takes public opinion as its own opinion and cannot make any claims. It has not been falsely claimed by anyone. The above sections are not factual. I am afraid that they will confuse listeners and readers, so I hereby request a correction and hope that it will be published in the letter column. I wish you good health.

Respectfully,

The Huai Salt Transportation Merchants Association of the Port, March 25th.

### Autumn and Spring

— Zhou Liangchao

"A frequently used door hinge does not decay, and flowing water does not become polluted, because they are constantly 'moving'." These few words provide us with a concise and essential revelation, which is to say, "movement" and life are interdependent: "Movement" is life, and life must involve "movement"; without "movement," not only is there no life to speak of, it's practically not human!

However, beneath all forms of "movement," there exists a divergence between "gain" and "loss"; "movement" that is methodical, meaningful, valuable, and benefits society, which is influenced by your "movement," is "gain"; "movement" that is base, undisciplined, purely selfish, engaging in destruction, deception, trickery, disruption, barbarity... is "loss." Therefore, we should not "move" unless we have to. If we hope that in the process of "movement," we can irrigate our precious lives with fertile nourishment, allowing them to blossom into splendid flowers, then, when we stand at the crossroads of "gain" and "loss," we must stand firm, use our keen eyesight, unwavering will, indomitable spirit, and the courage to cut through thorns and brambles, and move forward towards our determined goals. In this way, the result of "movement" will bring you the comfort of a victorious smile; otherwise, "movement" is driving you to excavate and bury your own tomb, giving you destruction, leaving you no chance for rebirth!

Therefore, we must not believe that "we have the freedom to exert 'movement' and control 'movement'"; we must understand that the gain and loss of each of our lives is controlled by the grasp of "movement."

My conclusion is: to live, you must "move"; meaningless, reckless "movement" is the "moving" state of "walking corpses," the ugly "movement" of "appearing and disappearing like ghosts"; holding a burning torch, undertaking the task of national recovery, this is our righteous "movement."

### Clothing Buttons

— Wei Jing

Clothing buttons on women's outer garments, such as cheongsams, seem to be merely accessories, but from an aesthetic standpoint, they cannot be ignored. Recently, I heard some advice from a dressmaker. He said that clothing buttons are to clothes what eyebrows are to a person's face. Although the position of the eyebrows is always fixed, women's eyebrows can be willow-leaf shaped, wire-shaped, moth-eyebrow shaped, phoenix-tail shaped, even Garbo-style and Clara Bow-style, endlessly varied. In short, they vary in style depending on the contours of each person's face to enhance their beauty. Clothing buttons are also like this. Although their position on the clothes is fixed, their density and length must vary according to each person's figure to achieve harmony. At the same time, one must also consider the color and pattern of the fabric, and strive to match the pattern of the clothing buttons. If all aspects are harmonious, then, like eyebrows on a woman's face, they will further enhance the charm of the appearance. If two good cheongsams are matched with incongruous clothing buttons, it is like a beautiful face with two brush-like eyebrows, which would spoil the scenery.

In fact, our country's women have only been paying attention to the importance of clothing buttons for the past ten years. Before that, cheongsams were not popular, and most clothing buttons were the so-called straight-shank buttons. If someone put on a set of simple coil-shaped buttons, it was considered very elaborate. However, no attention was paid to whether the style of the clothes, the color of the fabric, and other factors were harmonious with the pattern of the clothing buttons. In these ten years, women's love of beauty has made great progress, so in these ten years, the pattern of clothing buttons and the density of the buckles on cheongsams have been exhausted to the extreme. When making a new garment, most modern women often discuss the clothing buttons with the dressmaker and spend a lot of effort designing them. According to that dressmaker I know, this is not entirely meaningless, because clothing buttons, if designed carefully, are enough to take the place of lace. In this year of striving to simplify pattern lines, a cheongsam with only a simple row of clothing buttons on the right is enough to express its elegance and generosity, which is many times more beautiful than adding sluggish lace. However, according to that dressmaker, even this harmonious, simple, and up-to-date clothing button takes a lot of effort to design.

### A Visit to the Guan Nong Garden

— Yu Jun

In spring, I felt slightly unwell, and my illness lingered for more than a month. The beautiful spring scenery was inevitably disappointing. Yesterday, the weather cleared up, and I suddenly had the urge to travel. So, I took a streetcar and stopped at the Guanshengyuan Farm in Caohujing, West Shanghai. That day happened to be a Sunday, so there were many fellow travelers, with the fragrance of clothes and hair, heel to toe. In front of the Wangmei Pavilion, a Song plum tree, with ancient and clumsy branches, was covered with flowers, with a slightly green color, very different from the ordinary, quite clever and wonderful. Looking at its label, it was moved from Huayuangang, Hangzhou the year before last. It is said to be an antique from the imperial garden of King Kang of the Song Dynasty, which makes it even more precious.

Looking around the garden, the treetops were newly green, the willows had sprouted buds, and the gentle breeze blew, making the scene harmonious and pleasant. I couldn't help but feel the fullness of spring. After walking around for a week, I had tea in the shady Green Shade Cottage. As soon as I sat down, I met the owner of the garden, Mr. Xi, and chatted with him for a while. He then guided me to visit the Fish Paradise, with hundreds of sand jars and thousands of koi, which was a spectacular sight. Mr. Xi told me that the fish had been fed since the thaw. This year, the weather is warm, and the fish's bellies are already bulging. In another week or two, they will have to chase each other and scatter their eggs. In midwinter of last year, I visited Yangzhou and saw the famous fish raised by Mr. Liang Si, the owner of the Sanhe Canned Food Company. The fish were large and of noble breeds, including several pairs of "pearls," seven or eight inches long, with pearls as big as peas, each of which could be counted, which was delightful to behold. Furthermore, the water in which they raised the fish was clear and bottomless, and the scales of the fish were clearly visible as they swam in it. I asked Mr. Liang about this, and he said that this was the northern method. Northerners keep the water clear for raising fish so that the fish's body can be seen. It is not like the southerners who like to use green water. The clarity or greenness of the water has nothing to do with the fish's body, but we can watch them in clear water without the trouble of scooping them out. Mr. Xi appreciated his remarks and discussed with Mr. Liang, asking him to find a northern fish servant. He has recently come to the garden, so the water in the jars here can also be seen at a glance. I saw that it was indeed true. I returned and recorded it to tell those who love raising fish.

### Mated Mandarin Ducks

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Chapter 12 White boards nailed to the case return two lines of tears in vain; in the autumn, reeds and maple leaves alone roam half the city.

Between dignity, there was a hint of charm. Xiao Song saw Guoqi looking at this female student, seeming to be a little shy, and suddenly slowed down his pace. This made him think of the poem, could this be the person described? As the various speculations continued, the young lady had already walked in front of them. She was not at all shy, as the poem described, but rather stood still generously and nodded with a smile at Guoqi, softly calling him "cousin." Guoqi, in response to her generous gesture, also returned the courtesy with a nod, and they passed each other. Xiao Song waited until she had walked far away before saying with a smile: "So that's your relative." Guoqi replied: "Yes, but a distant one, we don't interact much." Xiao Song thought to himself, who asked you whether you interact or not? The two walked silently for a few steps until they reached the entrance. Xiao Song said: "Are you going to do something on the street, or are you seeing me off?" Guoqi said: "Seeing you off for a few steps." Xiao Song said: "You can stop here. Go back and write a few more poems, and I'll come to learn from you next time." In his heart, Guoqi was thinking that Ms. Li Youmei must have passed by and gone to his house. Since that time he misunderstood her, she was probably a little embarrassed and had never come again. Girls are more sensitive than boys, so he should go home and entertain her, to cover up this incident. So he hurriedly walked home, thinking that Youmei must be in his mother's room, and deliberately made up some excuses to go in, but there were no guests inside. He muttered to himself, she was so unconcerned about suspicion, had she gone to his study again? He steadied himself, opened the curtain slowly, and went in. He thought that this composure would not startle her. But when he went in and looked, there was still no one in the room. This was strange, could she have passed by without entering? Alas! Unintentionally, he had failed another person. So he took the manuscript of the poem, held it in his hands, leaned back in the chair, and began to recite it slowly. Suddenly, he heard someone knocking on the glass window with a bang. Guoqi looked back and saw a fair white face flash, and she smiled: "Isn't this Miss Li?" Youmei nodded a few times outside and said with a smile: "I came a long time ago. But I saw my cousin seeing a guest off, and I didn't know when my cousin would return, so I took a few turns in the alley. I only came when I saw you enter the door. You're writing poetry again, am I being a little presumptuous by coming?" (150)

### Record of Human Sorrow 1

— Zhou Shoujuan

On March 17, the 26th year of the Republic of China, Zhou Jianrong fell into a pond while cycling in the small garden and died. I and my wife Fengjun were heartbroken by this tragic event, and our tears were exhausted; Zhou Rong was the same age as Wang Qi, his death was not for the country, but it was Heaven's doing, what can we say! It has been more than ten days since my Rong'er passed away: I am saddened by the things around me, and I cannot control myself, so I write it down to vent my sorrow.

Rong'er, whose courtesy name was Zhongmei, was the third son and a sophomore at Soochow Middle School. Although he was not very intelligent, he was quite diligent in his studies; he was meek and obedient, and could be filial to his parents at home, and could please his teachers at school. Many classmates were also close to him. He loved art, and at the age of twelve, he liked to carve stones and make name seals; his handicrafts and paintings were quite impressive. He especially loved Boy Scout work, and was skilled in flag signaling, cooking, sewing, and buttoning; he participated in almost every inspection in the town. He was less than sixteen years old, but he was as tall and strong as someone in his twenties, and his clothes and shoes could be exchanged with mine and his elder brother's. My old mother is seventy years old, and she was happy to see him grow up so much. How could she know that in the blink of an eye, Heaven would take my beloved son away!

On the afternoon of the 17th, I was writing at the Shen Bao, and at about three o'clock, I suddenly felt restless and wanted to return to Suzhou. I took the special express train at four o'clock, and at about six o'clock, I drove to the Ning's house, where I suddenly saw Fengjun crying outside the door, saying that Rong'er had fallen into the water; I was shocked and terrified, and rushed in to hear that Rong'er had already been rescued by the servants and was leaning on Hua Ding's shoulder, spitting out water like a tide. I still thought he could be saved, and hurriedly asked Dr. Li Guangdong and Dr. Xu of Bo Xi Hospital to come and give him life-saving injections and artificial respiration: I also personally gave him breath, trying to continue his life. But human effort could not match the work of Heaven. Since Heaven was determined to call Rong'er back, no human power could save him, because Rong'er had long since passed away after being taken out of the water. I held his head tightly and shouted Rong'er's name repeatedly, but he did not respond to me. Although he died violently, his face looked as if he was alive, peacefully asleep; his whole body was not swollen, and his muscles were firm as before. Alas, alas, how could I bear to see the culmination of more than ten years of hard work thrown into the land of birds? At that time, my old mother was in Shanghai, and only returned after a few days, and did not have time to see her beloved grandson. She cried day and night, calling Rong'er's name, and the depression in her old heart can be imagined.

Rong'er was encoffined on the 18th. When the coffin was to be sealed in the afternoon, the wind and rain were heavy, as if Heaven was also shedding tears for him; and Rong'er went on his journey in this mournful wind and rain. I plan to bury him in the Xiu Valley Cemetery after the Qingming Festival, and from then on, he will be far away from his family and sleep alone at the foot of Mount Lingyan. In the windy mornings and moonlit nights, who will he be with? I only hope that the spirit will show great compassion and protect this pitiful child, and not let him be humiliated by evil spirits.

Rong'er's tragic accident seemed to have a premonition. At about ten o'clock on the night of the sixteenth, the family had already gone to bed. I was sitting alone under the lamp editing "Spring and Autumn," when I suddenly saw Rong slowly getting out of bed and heading straight to the outer room; I was surprised and asked why, and Rong said he wanted to find a book. I thought it was a nightmare, and hurriedly helped him back to bed, and touched his forehead, which was as warm as usual. Rong smiled at me and fell asleep again, and I didn't think much of it. After he died, my eldest son, Zheng, checked his belongings and saw the Shaeffer fountain pen that he used every day. It had been sewn tightly together, as if he had foreseen that he was about to die violently and would no longer be able to use it. Also, according to one of his classmates, Rong was writing an article in school that afternoon, and finished it in one stroke, looking very hurried; when asked why, he said that he felt confused and wanted to go home quickly. Who would have thought that he would meet with misfortune an hour after returning home. Alas, is there really Heaven in this?

### Jade

— Nángōng Shēng

Jade is a type of mineral that is found in the southwestern provinces of China. Before being cut open, it is a large piece of mountain rock with a deep yellow outer skin, concealing the green jade within. Jade merchants must be experienced with discerning eyes when purchasing jade stones, because it's not possible to cut open the stone and study the amount of jade inside. Therefore, one can only rely on their vision and luck. If a piece of mountain rock is found containing much green and translucent jade, it is not difficult to get rich; otherwise, there will be losses. Therefore, we often hear stories of jade merchants who become wealthy or bankrupt from buying jade stones.

The best jade stone is called "Dàngxīn Green." When the outer skin of this mountain rock is removed, green jade is revealed, reaching all the way to the core. The deeper it goes, the greener and more transparent it becomes, almost entirely jade, making it the best kind of jade stone. Unfortunately, only a few pieces can be found like this out of hundreds of jade stones. The remaining jade stones mostly have less jade. Within a stone, even having a five-inch square piece of glass jade is enough to gain substantial profits.

There is specialized knowledge for cutting open jade stones. People experienced in cutting jade can cut it out completely without breaking it into fragments. Therefore, when one obtains a piece of jade stone, it must be inspected by a technician to avoid unexpected damage.

The value of jade lies in the quality of the green color and the brightness of its luster. The quality is determined by these two aspects. Good jade is green and transparent, like green glass, hence the name "Glass Jade." If the green color is lighter and darker, it is considered second-grade. Colors that are like lake green and not transparent are the worst kind. Jade that has black spots or white lines inside is also not considered good. However, there is a type of jade that is green and transparent like glass, but evenly covered with black stars, called "Plum Blossom Green," which is also a valuable type because it is a rare and fine product.

The use of jade is only as ornaments and decorations. In modern times, the most common uses are rings, bracelets, watch stems, and buttons. Jade is also carved into toys and display items, such as the jade pagoda in a jade exhibition, which is a type of display item.

### A Series of Jokes

— Xiàolín

A Liú developed red eyes, was afraid of bright light, and often shed tears, but he did not seek medical treatment. One day, he went to a relative's house to offer congratulations. Because he saw the bright light, tears streamed down again. His brother-in-law jokingly said to him, "Why are you crying at a place of celebration?" This embarrassed A Liú greatly, and he quickly explained, "I'm not crying; my eyes are hurting and tearing up." Then, his brother-in-law said earnestly, "Since you have an eye disease, you should use 'Bright Eyes Eye Drops' from the Wuzhou Pharmacy, and your eye disease can be cured sooner."

Yān Cóng Did Not Quit

The government banned smoking vigorously, so Boss Zhao also quit his smoking habit. He proudly boasted to his friends that he was decisive, but his friends did not believe that he had quit smoking because his teeth were still as black as before. Later, he learned about a type of "131" toothpaste that contained medicinal effects and could whiten teeth and remove stains. After purchasing and using it, the black color gradually faded, and his teeth became clean and beautiful.

### Shanghai China Basketball Team Again Achieves a Great Victory Over Amateurs in Beijing Yesterday

Leading from start to finish with 36 to 25. The final outcome will be known next month when the Beijing United team visits Shanghai.

▲ Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th. The Liu-Kang tournament between the Shanghai China Basketball Team and the amateur team was performed at the Amateur Association at 3 PM on the 28th. There were more than 1,000 spectators. The amateur team was missing Li Zhenzhong, plus they were not practicing enough, resulting in a failure with a score of 25 to 36. The five players from the China team showed excellent cooperation. Their advance and retreat were well-organized. With Feng Nianhua and Wang Nanzhen as forward and guard respectively, they can be considered unparalleled. Zhou Dayun's left-handed shooting seemed divinely inspired, scoring the most points. Other players also performed their duties effectively. Their victory was not by chance. In the National Games, the Shanghai team will be a strong enemy for Beijing and Tianjin. Besides Tang Binkun and Liu Zhenyuan, who were as active as before, the two guards Yin and Zhang from the amateur team were very sluggish, with loopholes appearing from time to time. Gong Bangjie's playing style was different and incompatible. Wu Bixian was excellent, but unfortunately only played half the game. Otherwise, the outcome might have been different. To know the actual strength between Beijing and Shanghai, we will find out when the Beijing United team visits Shanghai next month. The China team members returned to Shanghai on the night train. The lineup is as follows:

The game started at 3 PM. Zhang Dongping and Xu Zheng served as referees. Liu Zhenyuan and Zhang Jingshi scored first (0 to 4). Feng Nianhua tied the score (4 to 4). Zhou Dayun scored three times in a row (10 to 4). After that, Tang Binkun and Feng Nianhua each scored. The amateur team remained at a disadvantage. In the first half, 23 to 11, China established a foundation. In the second half, Wu Bixian entered the game, and the two sides were evenly matched. Although Tang Binkun was extremely active, he was outnumbered. Yin Hongxiang and Zhang Jingshi frequently missed opportunities, ultimately leading to defeat. As a result, 36 to 25, China won triumphantly.

The referee is Bott, and the linesmen are He Chunhui and Shen Huichun. The Military Joint Team is actually the British Royal Army and Labor teams. Their usual coordination is more skillful than a temporarily assembled team. Therefore, Yates' defense, Neller's supply, Schabells' shooting, Tuiler's hook passes, and Whiting's activity can be fully displayed. Their forward line is the sharpest among the Shanghai teams. Their mid-defense is also tight, which will reduce the activity of the Tianjin team's forwards. The Tianjin team also feels the seriousness of this match. Therefore, their main players Jiang Yuehansheng and Tan Fuzhen are specially rested to show their skills. The entire team has also had a full day of rest to recover from their fatigue. According to Jiang Yuehansheng, the lineup for today's match will be the same as the championship match the day before. Zhang Xueyao will still not be present. The intensity and excitement of this match can be predicted to be more powerful than the championship match the day before and the China-Liu match the day before yesterday. The Tianjin team is scheduled to take the Shanghai-Ping express train departing at 12:00 tonight to return north to Tianjin. The lineups for both sides are as follows:

### The World Games Organizing Committee Has Major Disagreements

▲ The Mayor of Tokyo and the Sports Association are in a state of opposition.

▲ Mayor Ushizuka Disregards the Head of the Athletics Department, Mr. Gō Takashi

▲ The House of Representatives Has Approved a Subsidy of 4.3 Million

(Tokyo Special Dispatch) The issue of the Japanese government's subsidy for the 12th World Games has been the focus of concern for the local authorities, the Sports Association, and the World Games Organizing Committee in recent days. On the 20th, the House of Representatives Budget Committee submitted a supplementary budget proposal. Kōno Ichirō of the Seiyūkai, Katsuta Eikichi of the Minseitō, Prime Minister Hayashi Senjūrō, who also holds the post of Minister of Education, and Vice-Minister of Education Kawahara, had sharp questions. After much debate, the government subsidy of 4.3 million yen was finally approved. Hayashi proclaimed that Japan's preparation for the World Games should be carried out as a national undertaking, so that the conference could proceed on a bright path. The atmosphere of the venue was strengthened. The situation of all parties is recorded as follows:

Mayor Ushizuka Protests

Kōno Ichirō of the Seiyūkai first questioned whether the World Games Charter (rules) went against Japan's national sentiment. Mayor Ushizuka of Tokyo expressed dissatisfaction with the attitude of the Organizing Committee, stating that it was unreasonable for Tokyo to bear the huge cost of preparing for the World Games. Although it can proceed under the specific policy of the government subsidy of 4.3 million yen, why has a certain university that has been excluded from the sports community suddenly become active in the Organizing Committee's decision to hold the conference in Tokyo? Is the Organizing Committee becoming bureaucratic? If this continues, it will be impossible to proceed three years later. Therefore, he protested to the Ministry of Education. Vice-Minister of Education (Deputy Minister of Education) Kawahara replied that there were indeed many disputes within the committee, but he hoped that it would enter a state of complete agreement in the future. The Organizing Committee may not necessarily recognize the structure of affairs and can deliberate at length.

Construction is Permanent

Next, Chairman Katsuta Eikichi of the Tennis Association spoke, saying that Germany regards the World Games as a national undertaking, while the United States regards the World Games as a private organization's affair. But how should Japan view the World Games held in London? Prime Minister Hayashi replied that the World Games is not a matter for the national government, but the state must strive to provide assistance. Katsuta asked about the allocation of the total budget of 15 million yen, including 10 million yen for construction costs and 5 million yen for conference expenses. He inquired whether this construction was permanent or temporary, and what its purpose was. Vice-Minister of Education Kawahara replied that it was not a temporary construction, but a permanent one to enhance national physical education. Kodama, Director of the Shrine Bureau of the Ministry of Interior (Director of the Altar and Temple Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Interior), said that the Ministry of Interior is planning a large-scale movement field centered on the Outer Garden of Meiji Shrine.

Emphasis on Specialized Technology

Katsuta continued that there are currently few sports groups participating in the World Games, and the majority of government officials rarely speak, creating a state of opposition between the Sports Association and the City of Tokyo. Mayor Ushizuka has spoken excessively, leading to opposition even to Gō Takashi, the head of the athletics department who is of a specialized nature. The Mayor is purely a layman, and he is deeply concerned about obstructing the selection of personnel for the position of head of specialized athletics in this way. At the last World Games held in Berlin, President Hitler was dissatisfied with Dr. Lewald, the chairman of the organizing committee, but Lewald was the most suitable person among the sports community and specialists. Finally, President Hitler tolerated him, resulting in a good outcome. Therefore, in the future, matters of a specialized nature for the World Games should be handled by specialists, so that the organizing committee can be a powerful organization.

Welcome China to Participate

The Japanese sports community believes that the Republic of China is a major country in the Far East. Since the World Games is being held in Tokyo, Japan, in the Far East, the ancient and newly emerging Republic of China must be welcomed to participate. Any obstacles must be cleared, otherwise the sports community will inevitably be uneasy. Since the failure of the Chinese team at the 11th World Games in Berlin, the athletes have become aware, and the government authorities have also started to promote it urgently. The construction of a large sports field in Shanghai is proof. There are many rising stars among Chinese athletes, but the poor training and management methods in the sports community have led to failures. If they can prescribe the right medicine in the future, the progress of Chinese sports will be enough to shock the athletes of various countries.

Japan Trains Gymnastics

If the current World Games are held in Tokyo in three years, the host country Japan is now starting to train gymnastics. At 2 PM on the 20th, the first World Games lecture was held at the Keio University Tsunamachi Gymnasium. The period will last until the end of this month, totaling ten days. Regular lectures are scheduled to be held gradually thereafter. The summer lecture is scheduled to open in July this year. It is reported that the schools participating in this lecture are the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Waseda University, Keio University, Yokohama Higher Commercial School, Keifu, Keisho, Fuchu Sixth Middle School, and Urawa Middle School. The content of the lecture includes six types of exercises: horizontal bar, parallel bars, pommel horse, rings, vault, and freehand gymnastics. The instructors are senior alumni from various schools. The seniors Nonaka from Keio and Matsunobe from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences both participated in the guidance.

### West Qing Women's Volleyball Ends, Qixiu Wins Championship

Second Place, Gongnü Middle School

The West Qing Women's Volleyball Tournament has now ended completely. The last match between Qixiu and Adi Snow White Team B was held at 2 PM the day before yesterday. As a result, because the strength of the two sides differed greatly, except for the second game, which was slightly closer due to Qixiu's casual play, the other two games ended with a complete one-sided victory. The scores for the three games were 15 to 1, 15 to 10, and 15 to 1, totaling 45 to 12. Qixiu won a great victory. Qixiu now has six wins in six games and has won the league championship.

### The Match Between Tung Wah and Portugal is Postponed

▲ Yesterday, West Catch Greatly Defeated French Business

Today's Group A football game, originally Tung Wah versus Portugal, was to be played at the Municipal Sports Field. However, according to the latest news, due to the time of the Spring Festival, all banks are taking a holiday as usual, and most of the Tung Wah players work in the banking sector. Therefore, they went to other cities for Spring Festival travel. The match against Portugal today has been applied for postponement.

Yesterday, there were two Group A matches, both played at Hongkou Park. As a result, in the match between Lux and West Catch, West Catch greatly boosted its strength due to the return of the famous general Xiao Tuo, who took on the role of defender. Lux, on the other hand, had four strong players missing due to Spring Festival travel: goalkeeper Ikehoff, forwards Bollinger, Greenburg, and center-back Van Meng. They were replaced by reserve players, resulting in a vast difference in strength and being unable to withstand West Catch's attack. After a fierce battle, the situation was completely in the hands of West Catch. At the end of the first half, West Catch took the lead with a score of 4 to 0. In the end, they won with a score of 9 to 2, completely avenging the shame of their 14 to 2 loss in the first round. In the other match between French Business and Su Shell, Su Shell still struggled to improve. They were behind 2 to 3 in the first half. In the second half, they were completely defeated, losing eight more goals. The final score was 11 to 2, with French Business winning a great victory.

West Catch Defeats Lux (A) Nine to Two

French High Defeats Su Shell (A) Eleven to Two

### Business and Industrial Leaders Unite to Oppose Tax Increases

Hope the Board of Directors Reconsiders and the Taxpayers' Meeting Rejects　Otherwise, They Are Determined to Unite to Correct the Mistake

The Board of Directors of the Public Concession Bureau, based on the opinions of Western directors representing a minority of citizens and a minority of taxes, ignored the sincere dissuasion of the Chinese directors representing a majority of citizens and taxes, and actually established a 2% increase in the municipal general tax, from 14% to 16%, an increase of 2.5 million yuan in the burden on citizens annually. This case has aroused serious opposition from all sectors of industry, commerce, and residents in the concession. Reporters interviewed leaders from various sectors of industry and commerce in the concession, and all expressed that the Public Concession Bureau's measures were inappropriate and should be corrected. All hope that the board of directors of the bureau will consider the actual economic situation of the society and the hard work of the citizens who have been struggling in a difficult environment for several years to seek the revitalization of the market, accept the public's opinion, and submit the case for reconsideration, so as to conform to the purpose of the municipal authorities and the citizens coexisting and prospering, and revitalizing the market under the principle of mutual cooperation. Otherwise, the future brewing situation is difficult to be optimistic. Now all citizens are holding a sincere hope that the Western Taxpayers' Meeting will reject it. At the same time, they are vigorously promoting the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, and the First Special District Citizens' Association, and other organizations that have close relations with industry, commerce, and citizens, to unite and prepare effective measures to jointly resist. The leaders of these organizations have exchanged views several times and decided to accept the requests of all parties, and under a unified front, correct the mistakes of the Public Concession Bureau.

Speech by Chairman Wu Kaixian First, Chairman Wu Kaixian delivered a farewell speech, saying that today is the day when the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, together with various agencies and organizations in the city, are sending off Special Envoy Kong on his trip abroad to attend the coronation ceremony of the King of England. Special Envoy Kong has made great contributions to the party and the country, which is known to all. This time he is sent abroad, not only is the whole country very happy, but also the public opinion of various countries is deeply celebrating our country for getting the right person. This time Special Envoy Kong is going to England, not only can he enhance the friendship between China and England, but also take the opportunity to investigate foreign political situations, and he will definitely gain something to contribute to the party and the country. Today, representatives from various agencies and organizations in this city respectfully offer a small amount of wine to wish Special Envoy Kong and all the gentlemen traveling with him a safe journey, and also wish Mr. Xiao Xiange, who is going abroad to investigate industry, a fruitful harvest and a safe journey, and so on.

Commander Yang's Farewell Speech During the banquet, Commander Yang stood up and delivered a farewell speech, saying that today representatives from all walks of life in this city are sending off Special Envoy Kong to attend the coronation ceremony of the King of England. Special Envoy Kong has made great contributions to the party and the country over the years. This time he is sent as an envoy, with Special Envoy Kong's qualifications and reputation, he will surely bring honor to the country. At the same time, Mr. Xiao Xiange is present today. Mr. Xiao is ordered to go abroad for investigation and will surely have a good harvest and contribute to the party and the country. Today, representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai are gathered together to wish Special Envoy Kong, Mr. Xiao, and all the gentlemen a healthy journey.

Special Envoy Kong's Speech of Thanks Chairman, gentlemen, comrades, I am ordered to go to England to congratulate the coronation of the King of England. I am very grateful to the Shanghai organizations for the joint banquet. However, since everyone loves me, I have to express my gratitude to everyone and ask for your advice. My departure is imminent. This kind of joint banquet can save a lot of time, which is especially regrettable. And I hope that in the future, farewells and welcomes will follow this method. The chairman just said many complimentary words, which are really not appropriate. I have been serving in the central government, working for the country, always holding the principle of doing my best within my ability, regardless of labor and resentment, regardless of success or failure, and I think you all know it. This time I am going to England to sincerely congratulate the coronation of the King of England. The mission is indeed important. On the one hand, we must make the relationship between the two countries more harmonious in the future. On the other hand, we must make the two major ethnic groups more friendly in the future. The words "Responsibility and Distance" written on many flags at today's banquet are indeed correct. However, social interaction is not my strength. Since I have received a heavy order, I can only strive to fulfill it, so as not to live up to this trip. Four years ago, I was ordered to go to Europe and the United States to investigate the economy. I originally wanted to stay in the United States for a while, but the domestic situation at that time did not allow it, so I returned to China in a hurry, so that various investigation and investigation plans that were set at that time could not be completed. In recent years, I have often thought of going to Europe to continue the investigation. Therefore, after attending the coronation ceremony of the King of England this time, I decided to take the opportunity to continue the investigation in various countries in continental Europe. My country has been working hard to build a modern country in recent years. The Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee also passed the Nine-Year Construction Plan. However, when implementing the construction, we must learn from others. Europe has made rapid progress in the past four years. If I can learn from others and make up for my shortcomings on this trip, it may not be a contribution to the country. I am not talented and knowledgeable, and one person's energy is limited. This time, I invited many counselors and commissioners to travel with me, including experts in railway construction, international trade, and economic finance. The purpose is to achieve this. Before I was ordered to go abroad, I received letters and telegrams from all parties, all expressing that I should not go abroad at this time. The general idea is that the Ministry of Finance is currently working hard on economic construction, the Central Bank is preparing to reorganize, the country's annual budget is being prepared, and the financial sector is also waiting for improvement. All of these require my leadership. On the Executive Yuan side, since the Xi'an Incident, President Chiang's health has not yet recovered, and I must also act as the Vice President to take charge of the affairs of the Executive Yuan. However, these concerns are no longer a problem, because President Chiang's health has recovered, and the ministers of the Executive Yuan can all be responsible for presiding over the affairs of their respective ministries. Under the leadership of President Chiang, the advancement of government affairs will not be stopped at all. As for the Ministry of Finance, the internal organization is still perfect, and all affairs can be carried out as usual by the person in charge. The principles of reorganizing the Central Reserve Bank have been approved by the Central Political Council, and the principles of this year's budget have also been determined. We will strive to balance revenue and expenditure for the ordinary budget, and set separate revenue and expenditure methods for construction funds. As for improving the financial situation, experts are currently studying plans to improve the banking system and assist the development of industry and commerce. This cannot be decided within one or two months. After I return to China, I can personally preside over everything. Furthermore, from the perspective of the overall national situation, unification has been completed, and the whole country can unite with one heart and one mind. The local authorities can deeply understand the intentions of the central government and pledge to obey the central authorities. The central authorities can also understand the local difficulties and do their best to guide them, so the foundation of the country is indeed consolidated. Furthermore, since the implementation of the legal tender policy, the financial sector has become more active, and the good harvest last year has also brought about the revival of the countryside, so if everyone proceeds according to the original plan, the future of the country will be brighter. Therefore, I have no worries about this trip. In the past, I have served in the country, whether as the Minister of Finance, the President of the Central Bank, or the Acting President of the Executive Yuan, or the Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Commission. If everyone thinks that I have achieved a little bit of success, this is not my personal strength, but the credit of the guidance and support of friends and comrades. Today, everyone present is a leader from all walks of life in Shanghai. Shanghai is the center of the country, so everyone is also an important figure in the country. This time I represent the government and the people, and it can also be said that I represent everyone, to congratulate the coronation of the King of England. I believe that everyone's help to me in charge of various matters will be more effective than when I was in the country, so I can happily embark on the journey. In addition, if everyone has anything they want me to investigate in European countries, I am also happy to accept the order. I respectfully borrow the host's wine to wish everyone good health.

Commissioner Xiao's Reply This time, I was ordered to go abroad to investigate industry. I am not an industrial expert, but I should take this opportunity to investigate more abroad and hope to have some achievements and return to serve as a reference for the industrial circles in my country. At the same time, I should follow Special Envoy Kong and live up to my mission. I am deeply grateful for your kindness in sending me off and wish you all good health. The banquet ended happily at 10 o'clock.

Central News Agency reports: Regarding rumors that the Sino-Japanese Trade Association has decided to establish two committees, one for finance and one for industry, a Central News Agency reporter specially visited Mr. Zhou Zuomin yesterday to inquire about the details. According to Mr. Zhou's reply, the main points of the talks between Mr. Kodama and himself have already been disclosed and published in various newspapers, so there is no need to repeat them. As for the fact that the financial circles of the two countries have had little contact in the past, it was proposed at this meeting that opportunities be sought to establish contact so that opinions could be exchanged at any time. Also, regarding the cotton industry, it is proposed that representatives be nominated by both sides to investigate and study in order to seek mutual benefit. Mr. Li Shengbo and Mr. Wang Fuli are both experts and were invited to attend the meeting to discuss everything together. As for how the committee will be organized, it will have to wait for the consultation of representatives from both sides.

The conference was jointly initiated by the British Safety First Association, the American Safety Association, and safety organizations from France, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, etc., during a meeting in London in April 1935, inviting representatives from various countries to participate. All preparatory work was entrusted to the Dutch representatives. The conference will last for a total of three days, discussing industrial safety, public safety, and home safety. Industry and home will be combined into one group, and the main topic of discussion will be how to promote safety movements in various countries and study various safety and hygiene facilities and their effective implementation methods. On the negative side, it will discuss the prevention of disasters and occupational diseases, worker injury and illness insurance, and study the employer's responsibility for disasters. This international conference is still the first of its kind, and the invitation to the Chinese Industrial Safety Association to attend will be helpful to China's industrial safety work. It is heard that after Mr. Tian attends the conference, he will also visit the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Austria and other countries to observe factory inspection administration and industrial safety and hygiene facilities, and plans to collect various relevant documents, models, tools, and motion pictures, etc., for reference by Chinese factory owners and workers after returning to China.

### Xia Zhongyi and Others Establish Qinghai Wool Factory

To Be Completed in Five Years in Stages; Striving for Export and Development of National Trade

Wool merchant Xia Zhongyi, recognizing the rich wool production in Qinghai, plans to unite industry leaders from Beijing and Shanghai to establish a large-scale wool factory in the province, strive for export, and develop international trade. A reporter from the Industrial News Agency investigated and reported as follows:

Planning and Preparation: Mr. Xia's planning and preparation have decided to select sites in Xining and Huangyuan, Qinghai, to establish factories. The factories will be divided into: 1. Wool Washing Department, specializing in washing wool skirts to remove impurities; 2. Disinfection Department, specializing in eliminating toxins contained in wool; 3. Inspection Department, strictly distinguishing types and setting standards; 4. Packaging Department, in addition to paying attention to beautiful decoration, it is also planned to use steam power to pack, so as to facilitate postal transportation. In addition to the above four departments, it is also planned to establish attached chemical laboratories and warehouses. It is also planned to handle wool exports in Tianjin and Shanghai. As for the construction of the wool factory, it is planned to be carried out in three phases. The first phase is to establish one factory with an estimated annual washing capacity of 1 million catties. The second phase is to establish two factories with an estimated annual washing capacity of 2 million catties. The third phase is to establish three factories with an estimated annual washing capacity of 3 million catties.

Completion in Five Years: This plan is divided into two-year phases and is expected to be completed in five years. When the time is right, it is planned to establish branches in commercial ports in Europe and the United States to facilitate sales and avoid foreign control. It has now been submitted to the Qinghai Provincial Government and the relevant central authorities for approval in order to proceed. It is learned that the relevant authorities also believe that China's wool exports, namely the output of Tianjin Customs, exceed 10 million yuan annually. The merchants have raised funds to establish a large-scale wool factory to recover rights and interests, which is worthy of encouragement. However, in order to be cautious, they are closely investigating the source of capital and its business plan, and plan to provide technical and economic assistance to seek its development.

### Various Groups Request Protest Against the Case of Japanese Rogues Injuring Customs Officers

A Declaration Was Issued Yesterday and Sent to Various Public Organizations

Japanese rogues in this port, due to the domestic manufacture of bullets, need raw materials, secretly buy our country's copper coins and smuggle them out, plotting huge profits. On the morning of the 20th of this month, a large number of rogues used specially made giant pockets filled with copper coins and sent them to the Dayang Maru ship. They were discovered by customs anti-smuggling personnel. When they stepped forward to stop them, the rogues took out weapons and beat seven Chinese and Western customs officers. Later, a person from a certain consulate was sent to the dock to mediate, and a small portion of the smuggled copper coins was handed over. The injured customs officers were sent to the hospital for treatment separately. Afterwards, all Jianghai Customs anti-smuggling personnel issued a declaration, requesting the government to arm them, and requesting all sectors to uphold justice, to protect national rights and emphasize tax revenue, etc. The details have been seen in this newspaper. It is now learned that the Nanjing Road Business Federation, the Citizen District One Branch, the Fenghua Shanghai Fellow Association, the Western Clothing Industry Guild, and other groups jointly issued a declaration yesterday to various public organizations, saying: "China and Japan are countries of the same script and the same race. China is especially a kind and peaceful nation. Mutual respect for sovereignty and adherence to international credibility are the foundation of peace in East Asia. The expectation of coexistence and co-prosperity is also not difficult to achieve. Knowledgeable people in both countries have never failed to see this. However, with obstacles not removed, thorns are often planted on the path, and with wild ambitions not subdued, storms often arise on level ground. If unfortunately both sides are hurt, what good will it do? It is undeniable that there are many cracks in Sino-Japanese relations. Recently, enlightened neighbors, such as Mr. Kodama Kenji, came to China with sincerity to participate in the meeting of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, singing high praises for friendship and cooperation, seemingly wanting to dispel the clouds and mists to see the light of day. However, facts are the most eloquent, and unexpected problems arise, ultimately fearing that it will be a flash in the pan and quickly become a bubble. In recent years, smuggling has been rampant in various parts of our country. Not only is the tax source suffering huge losses, but also the industrial and commercial sectors are about to go bankrupt. How can this be tolerated? Although customs anti-smuggling is meticulous, the so-called rogues are still fearless. How can this be tolerated? Shanghai is concerned with international image. The declaration of anti-smuggling personnel, this kind of accident has occurred more than ten times in succession, which destroys customs administration, obstructs national rights, and cannot be ignored any longer. All public organizations and sectors in Shanghai should rise up to uphold justice, and on the one hand, appeal to the foreign affairs and finance officials to file several protests to protect national rights, so that our merchants and people can live and work in peace, and the hope of national revival will not be destroyed halfway. This is our declaration."

### Former Italian Finance Minister Stefani Arrived in Shanghai This Afternoon

Hired as Financial Advisor to Our Government; Will Soon Transfer to Hangzhou to Pay Respects to Chairman Chiang

Mr. Stefani, former Italian Finance Minister, has been hired as a financial advisor to our government for a short trip. He arrived in China on the Victoria Liner in early March and arrived in Shanghai at noon today (29th). The ship docked at the northern pier of the China Merchants Bureau. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specially sent Jiang Baili and Xue Guangqian as representatives to welcome him. Mayor Wu of this city and Secretary-General Yu, etc., will also go to welcome him. The authorities of this city originally planned to hold a grand banquet after Mr. Stefani arrived in Shanghai. Later, it was learned that Mr. Stefani's stay in Shanghai was very short and he would soon transfer to Hangzhou to pay respects to Chairman Chiang, so the banquet was temporarily postponed. According to news from our embassy in Italy, the Italian government treated Mr. Stefani extremely well when he left Italy for China. All the dignitaries went to the port to see him off, and the situation was enthusiastic, which was unprecedented. This is naturally due to Mr. Stefani's personal status and reputation, and it also shows the respect of the people of that country for the advisors hired by our country. Mr. Stefani was the first Finance Minister after the Fascist Party came to power in Italy, and he made great contributions to the initial financial reforms. He was highly valued by Mussolini. After retiring, he served as a member of the Fascist Grand Council and a National Minister of the State Council, with a very high position. At the same time, he served as the director of the Department of Political Science at the Royal University of Rome and personally taught a course in finance. Mr. Xue Guangqian, who was sent by the authorities to receive Mr. Stefani this time, was a student of his, studying wartime finance and achieving excellent results, earning the most honorable doctoral degree. He is Mr. Stefani's only outstanding student in China. Mr. Xue was originally a senior official in the Ministry of Railways. When Mr. Stefani departed from Italy, he requested Mr. Liu Wendao, our ambassador to Italy, to transfer Mr. Xue from the Ministry of Railways to study with him.

### Chiang Ordered the Ministry of Finance to Handle the Prevention of Duty-Free Foreign Rice Entering Guangdong

Grain Groups Submitted a Summary to Mayor Wu Yesterday; Gu Xinyi and Others Will Go to Beijing Tonight to Jointly Petition

After the grain and bean industry groups jointly requested to prevent duty-free foreign rice from entering Guangdong, the Executive Yuan replied yesterday, ordering the Ministry of Finance to handle it. Representatives from various regions will gather in Beijing tomorrow to petition. The details are recorded as follows:

Chiang Kai-shek's Reply Ordered the Ministry of Finance to Handle It: The Shanghai Grain and Oil Cake Industry Guild, the Zhaigong Association, the Grain Number Guild, the Bean and Rice Industry Guild, the Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui Rice Industry Federation, etc., since learning that the central government has approved Guangdong Province to import 2 million dan of duty-free rice, the Grain and Oil Cake Industry Guild and the Grain Number Guild telegraphed the Executive Yuan, Chiang Kai-shek, the previous day to request prevention. Yesterday, they received a reply: "To Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Grain and Oil Cake Industry Guild, etc.: I have received your telegram. It has been transferred to the Ministry of Finance for handling. Zhongzheng Jian."

Petitioning Mayor Wu to Prevent It: Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng was ordered to be transferred to the position of Chairman of Guangdong Province and will soon depart to take office. Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Grain and Oil Cake Industry Guild, visited Mayor Wu yesterday morning. In addition to personally submitting a summary of the reasons for requesting to prevent duty-free foreign rice from entering Guangdong, he also stated everything, explaining that if foreign rice is allowed to enter Guangdong duty-free, the price of domestic rice will inevitably plummet, which is contrary to the government's purpose of reviving the countryside. Therefore, he requested immediate prevention. It is heard that Mayor Wu promised to investigate the facts and then handle them after taking office.

Joint Petition in Beijing Tomorrow: Grain merchants from Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, and other places will gather in Beijing at 9:00 AM on the 30th to petition the Executive Yuan, the Central Party Department, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to prevent the duty-free import of foreign rice into Guangdong Province.

### The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Literature and Art Association Was Established Yesterday

More Than 100 People, Including Wang Fuquan, Attended; Constitution and Declaration Were Approved, Etc.

The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Literature and Art Association held its inaugural meeting at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at 2:00 PM yesterday. Shao Lizi, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, Fang Zhi, Deputy Minister, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Tong Hangbai, member of the Municipal Party Department, etc., were invited to attend and speak. The details are recorded as follows:

Members Attending

Included Wang Fuquan, Gu Zhongyi, Cao Juren, Hu Shenchi, Lu Shaofei, Dai Wangshu, Shao Xunmei, Jian Youwen, Shen Qiyu, Li Qingya, Zhang Jinglu, Xie Liuyi, Chen Zizhen, Zhao Jingshen, Zhang Menglin, Tao Kangde, Du Heng, Ruo Gu, Ye Lingfeng, Yao Sufeng, Fan Shenyun, Hu Huaichen, Zhou Jianyun, Wang Qingdong, Wen Yuanning, Zeng Die, Tang Hanmei, Huang Jingqi, Lu Danlin, Xiang Peichang, Yang Jinhao, Zhu Jingchun, Zhang Yiping, Ma Zidan, Wang Zhaoying, Jin Guangmei, Pan Zienong, Hu Xiongdong, He Xiya, Xu Wenling, Feng Youzhen, Gao Tianqi, Qian Taisheng, Wang Qitao, Wang Dingjiu, Louis, Yi Zhengfan, Lu Jiji, Xu Beichen, Zhou Duo, Ji Xizong, Chen Dongbai, and more than 100 others. Jian Youwen, representative of the Preparatory Committee, asked the conference to appoint a presidium, and Wang Fuquan, Jian Youwen, Hu Zhongchi, Zhou Jianyun, and Ye Lingfeng were elected as the presidium.

Opening Remarks by the Chairman: First, Chairman Jian Youwen delivered the opening remarks, saying, "Today, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Literature and Art Association is holding its inaugural meeting. I believe that all members of the literary and art community will very much agree with this organization, because at the last discussion meeting of the initiators, everyone felt that the unity of the literary and art community in the past was too weak, opinions were too divided, and feelings were not harmonious. Therefore, it has never been able to unite. Now everyone is aware of this and initiated the organization of this group. Of course, everyone agrees and is very excited. This association has been responsible for the progress of the 15 members of the Preparatory Committee. After five meetings, the charter and origins, etc., have been drafted and the association's office has also been rented at No. 631, 6th Floor, Continental Shopping Center. The origins are divided into five points, of which two are very worthy of our attention. The first point is that this association is initiated for the purpose of fully connecting feelings and exchanging knowledge. The second point is to gather all the strength, promote the national spirit, and jointly face the national crisis. Because it is entirely about connecting feelings, there is no political purpose, which will definitely eliminate the problems that prevented the healthy organization of literary and art groups in the past. Because it is about gathering the strength of the group to jointly face the national crisis, it will definitely eliminate all factions and prejudices, and fight for the interests of the entire nation and country."

Speech by Minister Shao: First, Shao Lizi, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, delivered a speech, saying, "Today, because I arrived late, I did not hear the chairman's report, but judging from the printed materials on the table, I know that there are now more than 120 members. Almost all the colleagues in the Shanghai literary and art community have participated. This is the first point that is commendable. Secondly, although the constitution of the Chinese Literature and Art Association does not have many articles, the organization is very meticulous. This is the second point that is commendable. What is especially commendable is that the five reasons for the establishment in the origin of this association are very thoughtful for the sake of literature and art itself, for the sake of literary and art writers themselves, and for the future of the country and the nation. I can definitely wish your association a great future. Because of the establishment of your association, the Chinese literary and art community and even the future of the entire country and nation can also be equally optimistic and have great hope. This is the third point that is commendable. The importance of literature and art to society, the nation, and the country is something that everyone present must understand better than I do, because I can only say that I am a person who loves literature and art, not a person who is engaged in literature and art. I often say that a person who is engaged in a profession must feel a special interest in this matter, have a deep understanding, and know the importance of this matter. People who are engaged in literature and art must also know the importance of literature and art, so there is no need for me to say it again. Therefore, my presence today can only express my sincerity. There is nothing to contribute, and everything that can be contributed is contained in the five reasons. Developing literature and art for the future, developing literary and artistic writers, and developing for the benefit of the country and the nation, it is really not easy to contribute any more opinions outside of these five reasons. But since I am here, I cannot but express a little sincerity. Therefore, I thought of the ancient saying 'Literature carries the Tao' to give as a gift to everyone. The saying 'Literature carries the Tao' has been opposed by some literary and artistic writers in recent years, especially those who write for the sake of literature and art. In fact, the saying itself is not bad. It is just that the word 'Tao' is mostly interpreted incorrectly. The interpretation of the word 'Tao' is originally very broad, not only the Tao of Taoist gentlemen, the Tao of Song Confucianism. The reason why many people oppose 'Literature carries the Tao' is that they misunderstand the word 'Tao' to be the Tao of Taoism. Therefore, only the words of the ancient sages can be spoken, and only articles related to the word Tao can be written. If you write that kind of article, it seems to lose the value of the text and lose your own position. In fact, there were two meanings of Tao in ancient times. One is the intangible Tao, which is the principle of how to be a human being is called Tao. The other is the tangible Tao, which is the Tao of the road we usually walk on. If we use the Tao of walking to explain 'Literature carries the Tao', it means that literature and art can indicate the road that life and the country and the nation should take. There are many avenues that life should take. What should we use to indicate them? Rely on words to indicate them. The meaning of 'literature' is broader than 'literature and art'. 'Literature and art' must be included in 'literature' and occupy an important position in 'literature'. Therefore, literature and art can move people and have the most profound and lasting power. The content of literature and art is not empty, it has substance, so it can move people. What is the substance? It is 'Tao', it is the various avenues that life should take. Therefore, the ancient people's so-called 'Literature carries the Tao' is not wrong in itself. The mistake is that later generations misunderstood the broad interpretation as the narrow sense of Tao, so it is dissatisfied by those who study literature and art. We understand this meaning, and future literary works cannot violate the road that the country, the nation, and society should take. For example, now our nation is being oppressed and bullied, and on the one hand, there are too many weaknesses in the nation itself, the spirit is depressed, and the will is scattered. Therefore, the avenue that the country, the nation, and society should take now is to demand independence, freedom, steadfastness, and unity. Therefore, the road that literary works and literary writers should take must also be the same. Now, in general, literary writers, Liu Yu, the Chinese Kuomintang and the Central Propaganda Department, have a feeling that they hope to get freedom. There must be many literary writers brewing these words in their hearts, especially those literary writers who did not attend or join this association may have this meaning even more. However, the Chinese Kuomintang is not the Fascist Party of Italy, the National Socialist Party of Germany, nor the Communist Party of Soviet Russia. Literary writers under the Chinese Kuomintang, I believe, will be able to obtain considerable freedom. But absolute freedom, unlimited freedom, I can say bluntly, will never exist, because it is already very clearly stated in the legacy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People that only the freedom of the country and the freedom of the nation are true freedom. Under the major premise of national freedom, there is no individual freedom. It is not that individuals have no freedom, because compared with the freedom of the individual and the freedom of the country and the nation, the individual must sacrifice a little freedom. The Tao of 'Literature carries the Tao' does not necessarily take one road. There are several roads that can lead to the avenue, and there are also various means of transportation. It is not limited to taking a plane or taking a train. As long as you can reach this avenue in the same way, you are free to take whichever road you want, using one kind of tool. Originally, you can have this freedom. However, if you do not proceed along this wide road, but proceed to a very dangerous dead end, I will say bluntly that you should not have this freedom, because it is contrary to the interests of the country and the nation. For example, now the country needs unity. If someone wants to lead the general public to the road of national division, we will naturally not allow this freedom. Therefore, on the premise of not hindering national unification and not hindering national revival, you can freely take your own road. Otherwise, there is absolutely no freedom. What is the avenue that the Republic of China should take now? In the current situation, the road on the left is impassable, and the road on the right is also impassable. It is dangerous to go in. Only the road in the middle can be taken. What is the avenue in the middle? It is the avenue of the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, we believe that literary writers must also proceed on the road under the Three Principles of the People and become the literature and art of the Three Principles of the People. Under the literature and art of the Three Principles of the People, there is a very free road that can be followed forward. This is a little gift that I am offering to you today. Finally, I wish you all a boundless future and the Chinese Literature and Art Association a boundless future! (To be continued)"

The Changxing Company sent small ferries to pick up the passengers. This time, the ship carried a total of six hundred and seventy-three members of the world tour group, with the aim of sightseeing in various countries around the world.

The ship anchored outside Wusongkou, and the ferries Scott and Alexander took the tourists to the New Customs Wharf at 10:30 am. They then boarded pre-arranged Yunfei automobiles for a sightseeing tour of Shanghai, including visits to the City God Temple, Zhaofeng Park, and a tour of the Zhabei battlefield ruins.

### Mediation of Treatment Conditions for Silk Weavers Tomorrow Morning

Shengdan and Other Factories in Nanshi Have Resumed Work, While Meiya Tenth and Jinxin Remain Unresolved

The silk weavers' demands for improved treatment conditions have been mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau. Except for the wage portion, which will be continued to be mediated at 9:00 am tomorrow, the rest, such as working hours, have been resolved. Workers in Shengdan and other factories in Nanshi have resumed work, while workers in Meiya Tenth, Jinxin, and others have not yet resumed work. The details are as follows:

Factories in Nanshi Have Resumed Work

At 7:00 pm the night before, a certain silk industry association in the district suddenly advocated a general strike in the city and led the workers from the striking factories to the area of Xietu Road and Quzhenren Road in Nanshi to join the workers from the striking Jinxin and other factories in preventing workers from Shengdan, Huacheng, and Jiuhua factories from going to work. As a result, the above-mentioned factories went on strike one after another. Fortunately, the authorities sent police to suppress the strike and dispersed the workers who were preventing work, and advised the workers of the striking factories to wait quietly for the Social Affairs Bureau's mediation tomorrow. As a result, the workers of each factory agreed to resume work. Yesterday morning, although the factories in the area started work as usual, they were protected by armed police officers sent by the Police Headquarters.

Meiya and Jinxin Have Not Yet Resumed Work

㊀Workers at the Tenth Meiya Factory in Baziqiao, Zhabei, went on strike again. After the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to persuade them without success, the striking workers insisted on demanding the release of one of the arrested workers. Because the worker had been handed over to the local court by the Police Headquarters, the workers continued to strike. ㊁After the workers of the Jinxin Silk Factory in Longrenli, Pingliang Road, Pudong, went on strike on the 16th, the Social Affairs Bureau ordered the workers to resume work by a certain date. The workers had obeyed the order and returned to work in the factory. Because the factory announced the dismissal of ten worker representatives, including Lou Zongfang and He Yao, the workers were unwilling to resume work and were still on strike.

### Fish Market Plans to Organize Credit Cooperative for Fishmongers

The Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce borrowed 70,000 yuan from the Fisheries Syndicate Preparatory Office to adjust the funds of brokers and lent it to various fishermen. Now it has reached maturity and is being returned one after another, so the results are very good. Since the official establishment of the syndicate, various loan regulations have been announced, stipulating that in addition to mortgage loans for each fishing vessel, loans for each fisherman will be handled by the cooperative. In recent days, many people have applied for loans. The board of directors of the fish market also plans to organize a credit cooperative for fishmongers, which has been approved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the syndicate is requested to plan and implement it.

### Pudong Electric Company Held Shareholders' Meeting Yesterday

Reports on Power Grid and Power Plant Plans, Election of Directors and Supervisors Announced

The Pudong Electric Company held its 19th annual shareholders' meeting at the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association at 2:00 pm yesterday afternoon. More than 440 shareholders attended, with a total of 15,848 shares represented. Mr. Zhao Jinxiang was elected as the temporary chairman. Then, Mr. Tong Shiheng, director and general manager, stood up to report, stating that the total amount of electricity sold last year reached more than 15.36 million degrees, an increase of about 4 million degrees compared with the previous year. Among them, electricity alone accounted for more than 11.23 million degrees, an increase of more than 3.35 million degrees compared with the previous year. It can be seen that the electricity business is developing very rapidly. The current maximum load has reached 4,000 kilowatts, and the annual cost of purchasing electricity is 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. If a new plant is not built, it will be a long-term game for others, which is not a permanent and fundamental plan. Over the past year, I have been working diligently, and I can report to the shareholders on two main points. First, the power grid plan has gradually succeeded. Our company has expanded its area and erected poles and lines in the counties of Nanhui and Chuansha. By the spring of last year, it had been largely completed. After March, it proceeded to Fengxian, and its line started from Zhanggang Town, passed Nanduqiao Xidukou, and reached Xiaotang Town on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. Now it has crossed Nanqiao and connected to Zhuangxing. In addition to the Nanqiao Liheng Power Plant ordering electricity from our company, the entire Fengxian County has been fully expanded into our company's business area. Electricity can be supplied to Fengxian Old City soon. In the future, it is planned to extend westward to Yexie, Zhangze, and Liugang, so that the people in the upper and lower reaches of the southeast of the Huangpu River can enjoy the light and power of our company. In the sense of the name, it is fulfilling its duties. Second, the power plant plan has also been gradually realized recently. Our company decided on the power generation policy in June of the year before last. After the approval of the competent authority, it purchased more than 70 mu of land along the Huangpu River in Wangjiadu, Shanghai County, for the construction of a new plant, and hired experts to draw up specifications and inquire about machine prices from various companies. It has now been decided to order two 5,000-kilowatt, 6,900-volt, 50-cycle high-voltage and high-temperature steam turbine generators from the German AEG factory, and two high-pressure and high-temperature Wan-tube boilers with an evaporation capacity of 25 tons per hour from the British Babcock factory, totaling about 45,000 pounds. The Construction Committee has issued a work permit, allowing the signing of a contract for implementation. Other scattered parts, such as distribution boards, transformers, cranes, and cables, are being ordered one after another, costing about 10,000 pounds, to be paid in installments, which is still affordable. The plant construction project will also be planned. Around the autumn of next year, this 10,000-kilowatt new power plant will be successfully completed. Other engineering business and economic conditions are detailed in the business report. Please review and advise the shareholders, etc. Then, Mr. Jia Jiying, supervisor, reported the income and expenditure accounts, saying that the total profit was more than 200,700 yuan after offsetting income and expenditure last year. In addition to the statutory reserve, a dividend of 8% and a bonus of 6% can be distributed, which is the same as the previous year. The chairman submitted the vote and passed it. Then, directors and supervisors were elected. As a result of the vote, the elected directors were Tong Jitong, Tong Shoumin, Qian Xinzhi, Huang Renzhi, He Jingzhi, Lu Bohong, Zhao Jinxiang, Yang Dingchen, Wu Yunqi, Zhu Hongqi, Wang Zhongxie, Song Wenkui, and Zhang Shilin. The next most votes were Wang Yiting, Chuan Zuoheng, Shan Yungong, and Zhu Shaoqi. The elected supervisors were Jia Jiying, Feng Bingnan, and Jiang Zhengxiang. The next most votes were Xia Peng. The meeting ended with tea and snacks, and the bell rang six times.

### Ministry of Industry and Commerce Sends Warships to Protect Fishermen During Spring Fishing Season

Requests Coastal Provinces, Cities, and Counties to Assist. Since its establishment, the Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has been seeking ways to assist the fishing industry, making its production more scientific and consumption more rational, in order to develop China's fishing economy and improve the lives of fish merchants and fishermen. At the same time, given that China's coastal provinces have vast fishing areas and fishermen are sticking to old methods, most of the fishing methods are outdated, so it has been seeking ways to guide them to improve and ordered the fish market to handle fishing loans to carry out relief. Recently, with the arrival of the spring fishing season, it is feared that the sea is unsafe and fishermen will be harassed. If strict protection is not provided, the losses will be huge. Therefore, in addition to sending the four fishing protection vessels Haiou, Haihong, Biaohai, and Haiying to patrol the waters of Wenzhou, Sheshan, and Daishan in Zhejiang Province, it has also requested coastal provincial and municipal governments to instruct county governments, public security bureaus, and provincial and municipal water police teams to assist, so as to be thorough.

### Postal Knowledge Q&A (17)

Question: ㊀I am a worker in the laboring class. After paying for living expenses, I occasionally have a surplus of two jiao (20 cents) per day. I always want to save this money in the hope of accumulating it into a fortune. Unfortunately, all deposits require more than one yuan. Amounts less than one yuan cannot be opened. I don't know if the postal savings can accommodate amounts less than one yuan. ㊁I work in an organization in the Shanghai International Settlement, but I live in Xujiahui, Shanghai. I feel very uneasy carrying my monthly salary home. I wanted to deposit the money in a post office in the International Settlement after receiving my salary, but it would be inconvenient to withdraw it from that post office every time I need it. I now plan to deposit the money in the Nanjing Road Post Office in the International Settlement and withdraw it at the Xujiahui Post Office. I don't know if the post office has this method.

Answer: Postal savings accounts also require one yuan to open an account. However, there is another method for small deposits of less than one yuan: purchasing postal savings stamps. These stamps are available in two denominations: five fen (5 cents) and one jiao (10 cents). All post offices that handle savings sell them. Savers can purchase them at will. When purchasing, they can also obtain a card from the post office to paste the savings stamps. Paste the stamps into the printed spaces on the paper. When it is full of one yuan, take it to the post office and follow the prescribed procedures to open a postal savings account and exchange it for a savings book. Afterwards, you can continue to purchase and paste savings stamps. Each time you paste enough one yuan, you can hand it over to the post office to deposit it into the book. The number of deposits per person per month is limited to eight yuan, that is, eight cards pasted with savings stamps.

At present, postal administrations, first-class post offices, and the Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hankou Postal Savings and Remittance Bureaus are selling a kind of savings stamp tube, which is also specially used for storing small amounts of money. Each one, including the key, sells for one yuan in national currency. If savers find the procedure of purchasing and pasting savings stamps a bit cumbersome, they can use this savings stamp tube to accumulate savings. ㊀Each post office that handles postal savings in commercial ports originally had a unified deposit and withdrawal method, that is, the money deposited in Post Office A in the same place can be withdrawn in Post Office B, and the money deposited in Post Office B can also be withdrawn in Post Office A. Your money can be used with the unified deposit and withdrawal method. Not only can it be withdrawn at the Xujiahui Post Office, but it can also be deposited and withdrawn at any other post office in Shanghai. The procedure for opening a unified deposit and withdrawal savings account is the same as opening an ordinary savings account, except that the seal in the "signature certificate" column of the savings book is the same as the seal on the "account opening application form." However, if you withdraw money from a post office other than the account opening post office in the future, the amount withdrawn per month is limited to fifty yuan. If it exceeds fifty yuan, you must first notify the post office (referring to the post office you plan to withdraw money from) of the amount to be withdrawn and the savings book number. You can only withdraw money after the post office contacts its administration.

### Modern Politics and China (Continued)

— Junshan

Third, today, everyone can naturally see that the political systems of countries that have recently recovered from failure, poverty, and weakness have almost all been successful in establishing a national political belief, a political leadership, and a political goal. This shows that no recently revived country has failed to fully implement a doctrine, obey a leader, follow a national policy, and achieve its great cause of revival. Then, why do we Chinese with awareness still hesitate and look around today instead of immediately catching up and embarking on this road to success, and instead come up with various tricks and shout the slogan of cooperation between various parties and factions? In short, if everyone follows a doctrine, obeys a leader, and follows a national policy, there is no reason why they cannot cooperate. On the contrary, if everyone cannot follow a doctrine, obey a leader, and follow a national policy, how can they find a way to cooperate? Even if they can cooperate temporarily on the surface, what good results will there be? In the process of its more than 50 years of struggle, the Chinese Kuomintang has always tried its best to accommodate people from any revolutionary faction in the country. Everyone has now realized how urgent the needs of the country and the nation are. Why not engage in the struggle for the revival of the country and the nation under a belief, a leadership, and a goal? If we do not do this, but only fantasize about borrowing the beautiful name of cooperation in the hope of selling its good plan of deceiving others and deceiving ourselves, then not only the Chinese Kuomintang, which has more than 50 years of struggle experience, will not be deceived by this kind of deception that everyone knows, but also the revolutionary Chinese people will not want our revolutionary Chinese Kuomintang to accept this kind of deception. This can be asserted. We recognize the trend of modern politics, and we are even more convinced that Sun Yat-sen's principle of ruling the country by the party is the great truth of ruling the country by doctrine. We must use party rule as a cradle to cultivate the foundation of our Chinese politics. Only in this way can our country and nation be revived and saved. Comrades, here is the cause of our country and nation, and here is also our own cause. It is time, let us all work together! Let everyone come and fight! (End)

### Steel Bar Lawsuit

Lin Baoting Sues Jin Cheng Bank, Complex Content Awaits Witnesses

Lin Baoting, the protagonist of Shiyu Hardware Store, was previously recommended by his brother Lin Jinting, the deputy manager of a money shop, to serve as a rent collector in the rental department of the British-owned Tailey Company. He served until May of last year, when the company discovered that he had embezzled several thousand gold in rent collected, so he was dismissed and the guarantor Lin Jinting was ordered to compensate for the private misappropriation. Shi Ting had a steel bill of lading, which he placed in his Shiyu store, while the 18 pieces of steel were stored in

Jin Cheng Bank's

warehouse. On December 15th of last year, Shi Ting suddenly sent a letter to Jin Cheng Bank, saying that the steel bill of lading had been lost, and should be voided if found again. The bank, because it had already been informed by Lin Jinting that he held the bill and claimed that the steel belonged to him, immediately replied to Shi Ting and informed him that the goods were stored with the agreement to be picked up with the bill of lading. If he wanted to report the loss, he had to find a written

responsible guarantee

from the store, otherwise, for the sake of the warehouse, the bill holder would have the right to pick up the goods. Afterwards, Shi Ting's store guarantee letters were not suitable for handling and were delayed. Although the deadline was exceeded, it was still not settled. The stored steel was not owned by him. Shi Ting then hired lawyer Xuan Zhendong to file a lawsuit against Jin Cheng Bank and the bank's president, Wu Yunzhai, in the First Special District Local Court, demanding the return of

deposited goods.

Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu Fuji summoned the trial. The plaintiff was represented by lawyer Xuan in court, stating the intent of the lawsuit and submitting letters of communication with Jin Cheng. The defendant was represented by lawyer E Sen to defend the case, saying that because the plaintiff had not completed the guarantee for a long time, the defendant could only be taken away by Lin Jinting. Now that Jinting has arrived in court, everything can be proved. Lin Jinting testified that Shi Ting is my brother, because he

used up Tailey's

7,000 yuan. Tailey ordered me to compensate because I was the guarantor. The bill of lading was given to me by Shi Ting himself last year to compensate for the loss of the replacement money, and it is still in my possession, and so on. The plaintiff's lawyer immediately denied that the bill was given by the plaintiff. The court then asked how the bill was lost, and the plaintiff's lawyer said that regarding this level,

it is really difficult to say,

but in any case, it was not given by the plaintiff. So lawyer E requested to summon the Tailey Company so that it could prove that Lin Shi Ting had embezzled a large amount of rent from the bank, and Lin Jinting is currently paying in installments. Judge Xu also believed that the plaintiff in this case was even more necessary to come to court in person to be interrogated, so he ordered the date to be changed to the afternoon of April 7th, and the plaintiff and witnesses would be summoned again for further questioning.



### On Soaring Prices (I)

— Liu Tang

The Shanghai wholesale price index indicates a return to the price levels of the early economic downturn (September of the 20th year of the Republic [1931]).

Newspapers are filled with advertisements for price increases across various commodities. Simultaneously, there is an abundance of news reports about labor disputes arising from demands for improved treatment.

From a practical perspective, three copper coins can no longer buy a large pancake that satisfies my hunger as it once did. A one-yuan banknote does not seem to stretch as far as it used to.

The table below compiles just the price increases advertised by various industries in February and March of this year, totaling fifty-three instances. In reality, all kinds of commodities are increasing in price. For major market items, the price increases are not always advertised. What is listed here represents only a small fraction of all industries, yet the scale is already considerable.

Looking at the reasons for the price increases, out of the fifty-three instances, only the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company raised its contract water discount from 25% to 20% due to increased expenses from the lower exchange rate of 1936. The rest are all due to the "soaring," "continuously rising," or "sharply increasing" cost of raw materials! In addition, a small number raised prices due to "heavy taxes" and "increased consolidated taxes."

To what extent have raw material prices soared? Just looking at the Shanghai wholesale price index categorized by the degree of processing, compared to before the implementation of legal tender (October of the 24th year of the Republic [1935]), the increase is indeed substantial. In October of the 24th year of the Republic, the total raw material index was 80.0. Now (February of the 26th year of the Republic [1937]), it has reached 114.9, an increase of 26.9%. The manufactured goods index has also risen from 97.5 to 127.3, an increase of almost 30%. The increase in the price of manufactured goods often exceeds the increase in raw materials (this is generally speaking) because increased prices also raise their expenses. In the fifty-three price increase cases, some have already raised prices for the second time. Some have changed from fixed prices to negotiated prices. Some, while not explicitly stating a price increase, attribute the higher prices to revised price lists. Others, like the soy sauce industry, have switched from accepting checks to requiring cash payments. In addition, many have increased prices by 50%, some by 10%, and most by 20%. See the table below:

Looking at these soaring raw materials, are they mostly foreign goods or domestic goods? Needless to say, more than two-thirds of the fifty-three cases are related to foreign goods.

Changes in currency value affect prices, and changes in prices naturally affect life. Not to mention the Shanghai cost of living index, which has clearly increased by more than 3% since the beginning of this year compared to last year. Looking at the successive waves of labor unrest in recent months, the textile, dyeing, silk weaving, knitting, reeling, tram, automobile, shipbuilding, and shipping industries, and even the timber, candle, and antique industries, have experienced disputes over demands for improved treatment. For example, the silk weaving industry, bringing together workers from ninety-eight factories, organized a committee to demand improved treatment and presented joint demands. In addition, there are countless other labor disputes scattered in newspapers or unreported. This is a real problem. Even if workers' wishes are granted and wages are increased, if the price increases are endless, it is doubtful whether the increased wages can solve their living difficulties. Moreover, wages and prices are mutually cause and effect. Increased wages increase costs, making further price increases unavoidable. If this cycle continues, it may be inevitable. But if prices rise and no appropriate and reasonable measures are taken, such a day will eventually come.

Not only are the prices of raw materials and manufactured goods soaring, but the activity in the official bond market is unprecedented since the issuance of consolidated public bonds. Public bonds can be considered wholesale currency, while banknotes are retail currency. Whether the recent surge is due to the high cost of all goods is unknown, but this possibility cannot be dismissed. Even though the legal tender has been extremely stable since its implementation, rumors continue to circulate in the market. While these rumors are typically spread by speculators and are not to be trusted, groundless rumors can create anxiety and destabilize prices, which is not the intention of promoting legal tender!

Therefore, regarding the future of prices, it is believed that:

㊀ Whether price increases driven by stimulation are truly beneficial to people's livelihoods and industries is something that deserves the most careful study.

㊁ The severity of labor unrest (such as the shooting and mutual injuries of workers at the Xin Yu No. 2 factory and the assault on a police chief by workers at the American Asia No. 10 factory) underscores the need for careful handling of price fluctuations to avoid triggering further labor unrest due to livelihood issues.

㊂ It has been a year and a half since the implementation of legal tender. If the financial situation achieves a balance of payments, then all unfounded rumors will naturally be dispelled.

㊃ The early establishment of the Central Reserve Bank, the complete centralization of legal tender issuance, and the consolidation of its credit foundation will allow prices to become more stable.

㊄ Increasing consolidated taxes and implementing income taxes both have the potential to raise prices. Under the current circumstances of industry and commerce, the method and amount of tax increases must be carefully considered.

㊅ Smuggling is becoming more rampant. If prices become more expensive, profits will increase, and the trend of smuggling may intensify.

### On Soaring Prices (II)

— Zhou Bodi

㊀ Price Increases Are Almost the Highest in the World

In an era of sound currency, currency contraction leads to lower prices. The result of lower prices is reduced profits for businesses, increased unemployment for workers, and rampant deficits in national finances. Thus, sound currency is destroyed by the overall economic recession, replaced by a policy of currency inflation. (Note 2) Under a policy of currency inflation, the first step is increased issuance of public bonds, the second step is credit expansion, and the third step may be genuine currency inflation. Regardless of whether the policy of currency inflation goes through all three steps, the fact that prices are stimulated by this policy and gradually tend to rise is inevitable. Naturally, the rate of price increases will be faster in the second and third steps.

The beginning of the policy of currency inflation in recent years started with Britain's abandonment of the gold standard in September 1931. Later, countries such as Japan and the United States followed suit. Our country also abandoned the silver standard, while countries such as Germany and Italy implemented strict exchange controls. Until finally, France, Switzerland, and others abandoned the gold standard, so that no country in the world did not aim to lower exchange rates and became infected with the color of currency inflation.

Countries that have adopted a policy of currency inflation have lowered exchange rates externally and correspondingly raised prices internally. Let us observe the prices of major countries in recent years as follows: (Take 1929 as 100)

Total Index for the 24th Year of the Republic [1935]

From the above table, it can be seen that Shanghai prices in January rose by 27.5% compared to October of the previous year; Guangzhou prices in December of last year rose by 26.71% compared to the previous year's total index; Hankou prices in December of last year rose by 16.2% compared to the previous year's total index; Nanjing prices in December of last year rose by 2.2% compared to the previous year's total index; North China prices in January of this year rose by 30.82% compared to the previous year's total index. Averaging these percentages of price increases, we can say that prices in various places have recently risen by about 22.5%. This exceeds the peak of price increases in Japan (Note 2) and is virtually the highest in the world!

㊁ The Friction Between Prices and Exchange Rates

The goal of currency inflation policies in various countries today is, on the one hand, to raise prices to stimulate industry and restore the economy; on the other hand, it is to suppress exchange rates to promote exports and inhibit imports, indirectly also helping industry to restore the economy. However, if exchange rates fall and prices rise at the same rate, the benefit of exchange rate dumping will be lost, and trade will inevitably tend to become unfavorable. Therefore, to ensure smooth trade, the rate of decrease in exchange rates must be greater than the rate of increase in prices. Of course, if these two rates differ too much, leading to a situation of "hunger exports" (Hudger export), that is also not good.

Of the countries listed above, except for France, prices have all tended to rise since 1931. Only Germany began to tend to rise in 1934. As for France, prices only began to tend to rise after abandoning the gold standard in September 1936. By now, rising prices have become a consistent trend in all countries. In particular, Japan's price increases are even more severe due to large budgets, virtually creating a problem for the fiscal authorities.

As for our China, since the implementation of the legal tender policy on November 4, 1935, domestic prices have also risen along with the global trend of high prices. A table is listed below to illustrate this: (Take 1926 as 100)

However, since the implementation of the new currency policy, our country's foreign exchange has been almost pegged at an exchange rate of one shilling and two and a half pence. This one shilling and two and a half pence is lower than the exchange rate of one shilling and four and three-quarter pence in October 1935 (Note 3) by 13.4% (rno086.6=13.4). However, the rate of decrease in exchange rates is clearly much smaller than the rate of increase in prices. Here, we cannot say that the exchange rate is not low enough; we can only say that prices have risen too high. Because China is a raw material country, too low of an exchange rate means that too many raw materials are exported, which is ultimately not beneficial to the national economy. At the same time, China is a debtor country, and as long as debt repudiation is not implemented, too low of an exchange rate is definitely not in the interest of public finance. Therefore, pegging the exchange rate at one shilling and two and a half pence seems justifiable.

But conversely, prices that are too high clearly nullify the function of exchange rate devaluation, making exports difficult and imports easy, effectively worsening trade. On the surface, our country's foreign trade decreased last year, but if smuggled imports are added, imports may have actually increased. Also, while exports appear to have increased on the surface, this may be due to the increased demand for raw materials from foreign countries during this extraordinary period!

㊂ The Disparity Between Prices and Wages

While soaring prices do not help promote trade, on the other hand, they harm the lives of ordinary people. Because the price index has risen, the cost of living index will inevitably increase accordingly. Let us look at the cost of living index in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beiping: (Take 1926 as 100)

Commentary

### More on "Smuggling"

— Shi Ji

Regarding the smuggling by shameless Japanese and Korean rogues, I believe that besides actively arming our anti-smuggling personnel and implementing armed anti-smuggling, there is really no better second option for us. Of course, we love peace and sincerely hope to strengthen diplomatic relations, but until the "friendly nation" voluntarily eradicates the illegal organizations of their rogues, we must arm ourselves to protect our interests in order to maintain the integrity of our sovereignty. This is not hindering diplomatic relations, and in Chinese territory, the nationals of "friendly nations" should also be subject to our laws. -- Although in China, due to the constraints of various unequal treaties, even this most basic principle that nationals of friendly nations should be subject to the laws of their place of residence has not been achieved.

However, now, after the Shanghai Maru incident of violent assault on customs officials, smuggling has not subsided, and the attitude of Japanese and Korean rogues is becoming even more arrogant. Even customs officials are constantly under threat when performing their duties. And for us, after anti-smuggling personnel issued a declaration "hoping that the government will arm us" and "hoping that people from all walks of life across the country will provide enthusiastic support for our wishes and demands," they are now being "investigated for identifying the leading figures." When anti-smuggling personnel held a meeting in the "club" to discuss countermeasures, they were also being monitored, with the justification that "the Customs Staff Club is a place for customs staff to entertain in their leisure time," so "meetings to discuss non-entertainment matters are not allowed." And "regarding anti-smuggling issues, they must obey the commands of their superiors and must not take action on their own without the commands of their superiors, leading to various disputes."

"Obeying the commands of superiors" is originally necessary. Taking the Shanghai Maru incident when Mr. Kodama returned to his country as evidence, the so-called "proper anti-smuggling measures" determined by the customs authorities also seem to have achieved practical results, "transferring all the smuggled goods to customs launches and sending them to customs for confiscation." But it is noteworthy that "when the customs went to search and seize the smuggled goods, the smuggling rogues initially planned to use violence to seize them, but Mr. Kodama and others were boarding the ship to return to their country that morning, fearing it would be too embarrassing." If it were not for "Mr. Kodama and others boarding the ship to return to their country," would these seized copper coins not have been snatched away? --- "If a fundamental solution cannot be found to eliminate this type of smuggling incident, future disputes are certain to arise." This conclusion is undoubtedly very correct and reliable.

Some people regard this "exceptional" incident as "showing that the rogues still have a sense of shame" and therefore take it as a consolation. In my humble opinion, this "consolation" is bound to be disappointed. Smuggling is now organized, and if the Japanese consulate police had not stopped them that day, they would probably have still tried to snatch the goods. We have seen this happen many times in the past, and Mr. Kodama and others only had this one opportunity. Unless there is a very good overall solution to Sino-Japanese relations, is such a "consolation" reliable? I think, in the near future, facts will prove this to us.

As for the "proper measures" of the customs authorities, we naturally hope that they will continue to be effective, but after the customs officials are beaten, do not continue to "travel the paperwork," allowing the customs officials to lie in the hospital and the copper coins to be snatched away and melted into bullet casings without effective measures being taken. Furthermore, do not adopt a passive attitude of appeasement, turning a blind eye and allowing anti-smuggling personnel to be under threat while you remain high above without "commanding."

### Candlestick

— Zhuo Ren

A bronze candlestick sits on my desk. The wax candle is surrounded by countless traces of rodent gnawing. Its once bright red surface has turned greyish-black. Yet, it can still proudly stand on my desk, giving me light. This is a rare gift.

I look at the electric light hanging in the room. It is so quiet, as if it does not know that its owner cannot afford the electricity bill and no longer relies on it. The candlestick also rejoices in its newfound favor. An arc of solidified wax forms on the wick, and the flame flickers, illuminating my bookshelf, my bed, and the portrait of my father on the wall… Perhaps he feels particularly close, because it is my father's legacy.

My father spent his life's energy almost entirely under the small light of the candlestick. When he was young, he studied by the candlestick, often until the pale dawn light shone through the window. But his efforts did not meet the expectations of him and his grandparents. After becoming a Xiucai (passed the county level exam), he could never climb another rung, even though he spent more and more time by the candlestick and worked harder. So he gave up his books and angrily turned to business. But the bronze candlestick did not grow distant because of his career change. On the contrary, they became even closer. After our whole family was asleep, my father would lock himself in his study. Just like when he was studying, he would calculate the profits and losses of his business, the abacus beads clattering.

He grew white hair by the candlestick. His energy, like a wax candle, reached the point where the light was exhausted and the oil ran dry. He passed away without saying a word of what he wanted to say to his lifelong companion.

However, once a year, the candlestick saw my father smile. On the night of the Winter Solstice feast, my father always came back from the store in the middle of the night. But that day was the happiest day for the whole family. Everyone waited with rumbling stomachs. The candlestick was replaced with the heavenly candle left over from the Mid-Autumn Festival, and a gauze lantern was lit in the hall, a rare night of light for our family. My mother wore an apron around her chest and cooked in the kitchen, also busy with the candles in the ancestral hall. She often took the time to go back and forth to see if the burning paper money had completely extinguished. She cooked the dishes that my father particularly liked with such care. Until the sound of knocking on the door and hearing my father's voice, everyone rushed to the door. Some took the lanterns, some grabbed umbrellas, and my mother always took the burden off my father's back. The burden was so heavy. My father's and mother's smiles reflected each other in the faint light, and the children cheered and rushed to the back hall.

My father kowtowed in the ancestral hall, silently praying for longevity, so solemn, so devout. Was he telling his grandparents that he had not achieved any official position? Until he died, he never said what he hoped for, because he urged us to study with exceptional strictness. "You must study!" He only had this one sentence. Back in the hall, the dishes were full on the table. A master chair was placed in the center, and my father's favorite dishes were placed in front of him. Then he laughed loudly—that rare laughter echoed in the hall for a while. He assigned seats for us one by one, and then sat in the master chair, snatched the wine pot from my mother's hand, and poured half a cup for my mother, as if treating a guest who had come from afar, saying:

"You've worked hard, drink a cup to warm your stomach."

My mother smiled, "It's cold outside, you drink more."

"It hasn't snowed yet, the cold days are ahead." My father always smiled, divided the dishes in front of him among us, and happily drank wine.

The candlestick accompanied my father on his left. The light illuminated my father's slightly drunk smile, gradually flowing full of candle oil and going out.

After moving to Shanghai, my father still liked to use candles. He said that he couldn't concentrate when working under the electric light. When eating the Winter Solstice feast, he also never forgot to put the bronze candlestick on the table, and also put the heavenly candle left over from the Mid-Autumn Festival.

Last year, the master chair was empty at the Winter Solstice feast table, and there was an extra cup for my father during the sacrifice. My mother didn't eat that day, and no one thought about the bronze candlestick.

Now, an arc of solidified wax forms on its wick, which is exactly the heavenly candle left over from the Mid-Autumn Festival. So I gently moved it to my father's portrait, let its flickering flame accompany my father's loneliness. Only it can know what my father wanted to say.

### The Spring of Huanglongxian

— Zhang Haopu

—— One of the Miscellanies of Qidong Mountain Wilderness

In the days leading up to my release from prison, I had made up my mind that as soon as I regained my freedom, I would return to "Vladivostok." Who would have thought that the world outside the prison was completely different from what I imagined? It had changed, changed so much that it surprised me. Not only was my dream of going to "Vladivostok" shattered, but even going to "Harbin" was not easy. So, I had no choice but to take the twenty yuan "old man's ticket" (Korean Bank notes) that the police were supposed to give me—the reward I deserved for five years of hard labor in prison—and leave "Dalian," leaving the slave's prison in the colony, and return to the Qidong Mountain Wilderness where I had lived seven years ago.

I once again set foot on the old, familiar sheep trail. Fatigue bound my legs, and in the gentle and warm sunlight, I sat on the right bank, dozing off. From the distant wheat fields, pine forests, streams, and the nearby valleys, the breath of spring constantly permeated. I was intoxicated, and fell asleep completely. Only when the twilight sieved golden light over me did I wake up. Hurriedly continuing my journey, by the time the lamps were lit, I had already found myself at the home of the hunter Chen Laotian.

My sudden return surprised and delighted the old hunter. After I clearly told him about my experiences over the past seven years, he was so happy that he shed tears. He treated me with such consideration, as if I were his own children. So, I stayed by his side, following him up the mountains to hunt, and down to the fields to farm. At night, in the thatched cottage, sitting under the oil lamp, I listened to him endlessly recounting his past and the history of "Huanglongxian."

The farmers and hunters of "Huanglongxian" are all honest and simple. They live peacefully, without hatred, jealousy, or strife and plunder. They don't treat me as an outsider; on the contrary, they are kind and close to me, so my life is integrated with theirs.

Spring is a joyous season, and both farmers and hunters begin their work. Only those sentimental girls and passionate youths are annoyed and curse spring. Spring ignites their flames of love, burning inextinguishably! Whether the girls are washing clothes by the river, or cutting turnips in the vegetable garden, young lads are always chasing after them. Sometimes, in the grasslands and orchards, one can constantly see young men and women talking and laughing intimately. Customs give them freedom, and no one can interfere or obstruct them. Spring sows the seeds of love, which quickly sprout in the "Huanglongxian" area. Free mountains and wilderness! People live without restrictions, they love peace, but they will not be bullied by others!

The snow on the mountains has long melted with the scorching sunlight. The pine forest rustles in the spring breeze, occasionally emitting whistles. The lumberjacks, tired and uneasy, grab their axes, and it takes a long time to chop down a tree. After lunch, as usual, I go up the mountain alone, napping on a large stone bank, or else chatting with the lumberjacks. Once the sun turns to the west, I shoulder my gun to hunt rabbits and pheasants. The best to hunt during this time are pheasants, they are always in pairs and not very alert, so I hit them nine out of ten times, and mostly the females.

The mountains and fields are filled with pleasant atmosphere. Farmers sing mountain songs in the wheat fields, and the village girls sing too? No, not mountain songs, but love songs yearning for spring. Old hunter Chen Laotian's daughter also sings all day long, singing while grinding, singing while cooking. When her lover comes, she lets her throat rest. When her lover leaves, she sings again. Perhaps singing can dispel worries?

One day, I, along with the old hunter's daughter and her lover, carried hunting guns and walked along the river that surrounds the village. The clear, limpid water glistened with shimmering ripples, and flocks of ducks floated. Children rolled up their trousers and caught fish and shrimp in the water, their bodies splashed with water stains and green moss. We crossed the stone bridge and walked east towards the willows. The bare willow branches had already sprouted tender green buds. Sparrows leaped on the grass, looking for caterpillars that had just emerged from the soil. Outside the woods was a vast, flat field, the green wheat fields and the clear, blue sky reflected each other. Flocks of geese were eating wheat seedlings in the wheat fields. We loaded our guns to shoot the geese. But geese are very alert birds that don’t even brush the grass, so they are very difficult to shoot. With great difficulty, the three of us found two "grass stalks??" to use as cover, and the three of us fired at the same time. With the sound of the guns, the flocks of geese flew up, scattering in all directions. We ran over, and did not miss, killing five pairs. Zhizi (the old hunter's daughter) laughed, she carried the dead geese, and looked at her lover and smiled. We then turned into the valley, rested for a while on the lawn by the stream, and ran to the pine forest to hunt rabbits. The cuckoo kept calling, but no one bothered it. According to the customs here, hunters cannot shoot cuckoos. It is a heavenly bird that urges farmers to cultivate, like an angel with a mission, people cannot harm it. Zhizi suddenly spotted a pair of wildcats and shot one with a single shot. She jumped up with joy. She said she hadn’t shot a wildcat in two years, and wildcat skins are very valuable. As we were walking, two young hunters walked towards us. They told us that there was a raccoon dog in a deep stone cave behind the hillside. They had been following it for three days, and several shots had missed. They wanted us to go and hunt it together. We turned over the hillside and climbed over two large stone ridges before reaching the vicinity of the stone cave. We tried various methods to get the raccoon dog to come out, but failed. Finally, we all lay on the ground, silent, and after a long time, it finally came out. The five of us fired at the same time. In the midst of the chaotic gunfire, the raccoon dog was killed by bullets.

When we returned in the evening, the old hunter was very satisfied. Our harvest was great. That night, the village was extremely lively, with gongs and drums, burning incense and paper, for tomorrow was the day of worshiping the Spring God.

### Sai Jinhua (10)

— Chen Hezuo

The group of gentry boxers is called the Yihetuan. Their spirit has indeed established many glorious deeds. For example, boycotting foreign goods, no matter what household, if there are foreign goods, they must be quickly destroyed. Otherwise, they will be "rewarded" with wooden blocks and glass shards. People who understand and speak foreign languages ​​are regarded as "straight eyes" and "second devils," which means traitors. When caught on the altar, the elder brother burns two talismans and asks if you are a good person. If the talismans rise after burning, you are a good person; otherwise, you will be chopped to death immediately. Of course, there are also those who died unjustly; but at that time, there were indeed many people who understood and spoke foreign languages ​​who became traitors selling out the nation.
