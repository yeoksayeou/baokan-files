### Enemy Troops Launched a General Attack on Nanshi Yesterday, Our Loyal and Brave Soldiers Responded with Blood

Over Twenty Enemy Planes Took Turns Bombing, Utterly Inhuman - Repeated Fierce Attacks on Rihui Port Were All Repelled by Our Troops - The Enemy Suffered Extremely Heavy Losses in the Rice Market Ferry and Huacao Areas

A Central News Agency dispatch reports that the enemy troops launched a general attack on Nanshi starting at 1 PM yesterday. More than 20 bombing planes flew low over the concession, taking turns dropping bombs on Nanshi. A reporter witnessed that, in just fifteen minutes from 2:15 PM to 2:30 PM, as many as forty or fifty bombs were dropped. At the same time, enemy warships also relentlessly bombarded the area with heavy artillery. For a time, black smoke filled the sky, and the sound shook the buildings. The tragic situation was unprecedented since the start of the Shanghai battle. Many residents of the concession went to the tops of high-rise buildings to watch the battle. Seeing these executioners of humanity carrying out their slaughter, everyone was filled with righteous indignation and grief. The loyal and brave soldiers of the 55th Division's Brigade, who were ordered to defend the area to the death, and the city's police force, under the command of Cai Jingjun, fought bravely and tenaciously, their morale was particularly inspiring and tear-jerking. The troops ordered to defend Nanshi began to make frontal contact with the enemy yesterday morning. Although the enemy relied on its powerful naval, land, and air weapons to launch fierce attacks, our positions remained unshaken. At around 6 AM yesterday morning, the enemy first used a small detachment, equipped with small tanks, and launched a three-pronged attack along Longhua Road, Xieshi Road, and Xuxu Road. When they approached the shore of Rihui Port, they were immediately swept by our machine gun fire, and several enemy soldiers fell in response. Although their tanks charged back and forth, they were unable to cross because the bridges at all intersections had been destroyed. After a stalemate of about an hour, the enemy retreated west of Damu Bridge. At about 10 AM, more than 200 enemy soldiers, accompanied by two mortars, advanced eastward along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, but were also met with a head-on attack by our defending troops, who repelled them. The enemy launched several more attacks in the afternoon, but all failed.

Our troops relied on solid fortifications and calmly responded to the battle. Seeing the enemy approaching the coast, they immediately swept them with machine gun fire. Many enemy soldiers fell in response. Seeing that we were prepared, the enemy fought stubbornly for about two hours, but ultimately failed.

Yesterday morning (the 10th) at 6 AM, two enemy tanks, covering more than a hundred enemy soldiers, and another two enemy tanks, covering fifty or sixty enemy soldiers, attacked Pingyin Bridge, Kangqu Bridge, and other places. Our ××× troops, who were ordered to defend Nanshi, met them with a head-on attack. After a stalemate of more than an hour, the enemy retreated knowing the difficulty.

Enemy Assembles in the Xujiahui Area

A Central News Agency dispatch reports that the enemy troops attacking Nanshi are currently assembling in the Xujiahui area, and a large amount of military equipment, both light and heavy, has been transported there. They started building fortifications at Damu Bridge and Fenglin Bridge last night. Yesterday morning (the 10th), they sent hundreds of enemy soldiers to patrol and loot in various places. At the same time, many enemy planes, in groups of three or five, flew over the entire Nanshi and the neighboring French Concession, circling for a long time, but did not drop bombs.

### Enemy Lands at Kaiping Wharf

A Central News Agency dispatch reports that the Kaiping Coal Mine Wharf (west of Rihui Port in Nanshi) is operated by a British merchant. Our troops did not set up defensive fortifications there, but the enemy, disregarding international trust and righteousness, actually landed there and built fortifications near a certain American-owned house flying the American flag, attempting to use the special terrain to launch an attack.

### Enemy at Rice Market Ferry Heavily Besieged and Suffers Heavy Losses

We Killed More Than a Hundred Enemies East of Huacao Town

A Central News Agency dispatch reports that our new front line, south of Nanxiang, is between the Suzhou River and the Huangpu River, holding several key points in Huangdu, Qingpu, and Songjiang.

Up to the line from Nanxiang to the north to Liuhe, our positions have not changed.

We Surround the Remaining Enemy at the Rice Market Ferry

More Than a Hundred Enemies Annihilated East of Huacao Town

A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 1 PM on the 10th that our troops on the south bank of the Suzhou River near Zhujiabang were ordered to withdraw westward, and yesterday morning, they had set up new positions near Huacao Town. However, our covering troops were still in the Hejiashang Chenxiang area, about 600 meters east of the town. The enemy's advance units, about 300 men, advanced westward along the Bias Road at 9:30 PM last night and encountered our troops, resulting in contact. Our troops immediately adopted an encirclement formation and annihilated more than a hundred enemy soldiers. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, the enemy retreated under the cover of tanks.

### Enemy Shallow-Draft Gunboats Attacked Our Nanshi Last Night

Sailed Close to the Blockade Line, Attempting to Attack Nanshi - Launched a Fierce Attack at Around 9 PM Last Night

After our Nanshi military and police forces were ordered by the highest authorities to defend the Nanshi area, the enemy became quite anxious. Therefore, starting at 2:40 PM yesterday, in addition to sending a large number of planes to bomb the area, attempting to destroy it, a shallow-draft gunboat of the enemy army, which was parked on the river surface of the Gonghexiang Wharf, sailed past the defense zones of the British, American, and French fleets, and parked on the river surface of the Jinliyuan Wharf in Shiliupu, only a hundred meters away from our blockade line, with the intention of bombing Nanshi from the Huangpu River. At that time, residents in the area were panicked when they saw the enemy warship suddenly arriving,

and moved away in droves. The fish markets in the Shiliupu area also closed early. At the same time, after learning about the situation, the French Concession authorities specially dispatched military and police to the Shiliupu area to be stationed there to strengthen the defense. As for our Nanshi military and police forces, they had long understood the enemy's intentions, so they had already strengthened their defenses at various strongholds. If the enemy advanced, they would launch a head-on attack. At 9:20 PM, the enemy warship indeed opened fire with machine guns, spraying our troops in Nanshi. The gunfire was very dense, shaking the surroundings of the Huangpu River, with about a hundred rounds per minute. Our troops calmly responded to the battle, only returning fire three or five times after the enemy warship fired a burst, and using small cannons to aim at the enemy warship. According to nearby witnesses, the enemy warship was hit by cannon shells, making several loud noises, and sparks were seen flying. At that time, there were also two enemy planes circling in the sky over the concession before leaving. The gunshots stopped at 10:30 PM, but the enemy warship remained, and it is expected that the warship will make further moves in the future.

A Central News Agency dispatch reports that the enemy's fierce attack on the Rihui Port line was unsuccessful. At around 5 PM yesterday, they used gunboats to sail to the Jinliyuan Wharf in Nanshi, attempting to break through our blockade line and attack from the Huangpu River. Our troops were on high alert. At 7 PM, the enemy used two shallow-water boats, carrying about fifty or sixty sailors, and sailed to the blockade line, attempting to sabotage it. Our troops retaliated with howitzer cannons and machine guns, and the enemy also retaliated, resulting in contact. By 8 PM, the battle became increasingly fierce, but the enemy's plan ultimately failed. Then, an enemy warship quietly sailed away, leaving one warship behind, and remaining in a stalemate with us.

### Our Air Force Flew to Hangzhou Bay in Several Squadrons to Bomb Enemy Warships

One Ship Was Hit and Caught Fire

Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 9th: The enemy who had infiltrated Zhejiang Province, after being surrounded and suppressed by our troops on three sides, was already unable to hold out on the 9th, and fled back to the enemy warships. However, the enemy who had been surrounded by us along the coast was still stubbornly resisting, and it is expected that they can be cleared up in the near future. Also, our air force flew to Hangzhou Bay several times in the morning of the 9th to bomb enemy warships. One ship was hit and caught fire. Our planes safely returned after completing their mission.

### The City Defense Corps Assists the Military and Police in Combat

Expressing the Spirit of Our Great Shanghai

Since the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, the City Defense Corps of this city, by the order of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, concentrated and reorganized the officers and members of the defense corps in the city's seventeen districts into two regiments. The first regiment consisted of the ten districts south of the Suzhou River, including Pusong, Fahua, Caojing, Hunan, and the Pudong areas of Gaoqiao, Gaohang, Lihang, Yangjing, Tangqiao, and Yangsi. The second regiment consisted of the seven districts north of the Suzhou River, including Zhenru, Pengpu, Huhua, Yinxiang, Jiangwan, and Wusong. At that time, the first regiment was ordered to be under the command of Director Cai Jingjun of the Police Bureau to assist the police in defense. The second regiment was under the command of Chief Director Ji Zhangjian of the Security Corps to assist the troops in combat. Since the start of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, they have participated in combat in the Zhabei Qingyun Bridge area, and have also taken on the roles of guides, paramedics, and stretcher-bearers. They have made great contributions to maintaining local security and preventing traitors. Later, they were ordered to construct solid fortifications in the Nanxiang, West Shanghai, and South Shanghai areas, which are now the fortifications in the combat areas, and received commendation from Commander-in-Chief. Later, on October 5th, they were ordered to place the defense corps in the Pudong districts under the command of the ×× Division. On October 12th, the first regiment of the defense corps in South Shanghai was placed under the command of Director Cai Jingjun of the City Police Bureau, and the second regiment was placed under the command of the ×× Brigade of the ×× Division. On October 26th, the second regiment was ordered to move to the area west of Rihui Port and east of Tianyao Bridge for alert duties, under the command of Commander Yang. On the 9th of this month, the enemy troops broke through Bridge No. 1 on Zhongshan Road and outflanked South Shanghai from Longhua. Because the second regiment of the defense corps only had rifles and no other weapons, and the ammunition had been used up during combat, and they had not been able to replenish it due to being engaged in constructing fortifications, they were unable to firmly resist and retreated towards Nanshi. By 2 PM, after the main force had passed through Rihui Port, enemy soldiers had advanced from Fenglin Bridge and Xietu Road towards Rihui Port. Their forward scouts, numbering eight, charged forward while randomly firing with submachine guns. When they reached the Xiaomu Bridge intersection, Xu Keqiang, the team leader of the first squad of the first platoon of the second regiment of our defense corps, led a class of members and ambushed at the Damu Bridge intersection, providing rear guard cover. Seeing the enemy soldiers approaching, he gave a command, and box cannons showered the enemy soldiers like rain. Two enemy soldiers were seen falling to the ground after being hit. The remaining soldiers fled backward. Seeing that the mission had been accomplished, Team Leader Xu safely retreated past Rihui Port. Soon after, seven enemy armored vehicles arrived. When they approached Rihui Port, they were hit by landmines and also retreated. Currently, in addition to a part of the City Defense Corps that is still maintaining security in Pudong, the Nanshi troops of the first regiment, led by Regiment Commander Yu Zhaopeng, Regiment Adjutants Wang Zhuangfei and Lu Yongqi, and Battalion Commanders Zhu Shengyang, Feng Runsheng, and Fang Weiren, are assisting the military and police in holding Nanshi to the death, making a final stand to show the spirit of our Great Shanghai.

### The Isolated Troops in Nanshi Shot Down Two Enemy Planes

Over a thousand enemy planes flew to Nanshi to bomb in teams of two or three from 1 PM to 5 PM yesterday, dropping dozens of bombs and destroying many civilian houses. However, our defensive fortifications were not damaged. When the enemy planes ran rampant, our troops used anti-aircraft guns to bombard them and hit two of them, which crashed near the South Railway Station. The planes were destroyed and the people were killed. The isolated troops who are holding Nanshi in difficult circumstances demonstrated such an amazing power, and their heroic conduct is admirable.

### The Administrative Power of the Public Concession Will Never Be Changed

The Japanese Side Absolutely Must Not Interfere

The "Continental Daily News" of this city reports that a certain senior official of the Municipal Council told a reporter of the "Continental Daily News" on the 9th that the Shanghai battle situation had suddenly changed. However, the Municipal Council will still follow its original aim, making the Public Concession a place where Chinese and foreign people can live in peace. Chinese newspapers and public organizations, as long as their actions do not conflict with the law and order, can still maintain their original status. As for the administrative power of the Public Concession, even when the Japanese army occupies areas outside the Public Concession and the French Concession, it will still be held by the elected directors, and the Japanese side will not interfere. The senior official then denied the rumor that the Shanghai Municipal Council, in view of the increased influence of Japan on the north bank of the Suzhou River, was planning to increase the number of Japanese personnel, saying that the Municipal Council had never discussed this issue since the start of the Shanghai Battle, and that the rumor was purely a fabrication. Also, the issue of restoring police power over the extra-territorial roads is being closely watched. It seems that the police power there will not be restored immediately before the situation in West Shanghai is clarified.

### A Young Englishman Bravely Does Good Deeds and Rescues Refugees in Hongqiao Village

Although in an Extremely Critical Situation, He Remained Very Calm - Finally Overcame Difficulties and Saved a Family of Seven

The "North-China Daily News" reports that a certain young British architect, accompanied by a Chinese carpenter, went to Hongqiao Village at 10:45 AM on Tuesday, passing through the French soldiers' defense line in Xujiahui, to check on his damaged property. On the way, he went through many dangers and was stopped by Japanese soldiers, who wanted to drag the carpenter down. Fortunately, the young man protected him and was able to pass through. When he arrived at his destination, he saw that the building was not damaged, but there was a Chinese family of seven, old and young, who were taking refuge inside, terrified. The young man was immediately filled with compassion and told them to get into the car, and stuffed the things they had brought into the car, and carried them to Shanghai. The gratitude of the people is self-evident. At first, they encountered twenty Japanese soldiers. After the young man negotiated with them, they were fortunately released. Later, they were blocked by Japanese soldiers again, who opened the car door and wanted to drag the refugees down. The young man told them that they were all non-combatants and were servants of the house, and said that he was an Englishman, and showed his passport. The Japanese soldiers seemed even more angry when they heard this. One of them, who was tall, in addition to carrying a rifle and a pistol, also held a stick, stepped forward and took the passport from the young man's hand, and pointed a pistol at him. The young man saw a wounded Chinese person nearby, and saw a Japanese soldier holding a gun on his shoulder in the corner of his eye. Then he heard the sound of a bullet being fired, because he was killing someone again. The young man's hair stood on end at this time, but although he was in imminent danger, he did not give in. He tried his best to prevent the Japanese soldiers from dragging the people down, so as to avoid a tragic death. So, on the one hand, he ordered the people in the car to sit still and not move, and on the other hand, he argued loudly, pretending to be imposing, in order to prevent the Japanese soldiers from acting recklessly immediately. Earlier, a Japanese soldier was repairing an abandoned truck of the Chinese army on the road, and was struggling to find a way. The young man stopped and watched, and immediately discovered the location of the damage. The Japanese soldier was quite angry with him. At the critical moment, the Japanese soldier suddenly drove the truck to the scene. The young man hurriedly greeted him as if he were an old friend, so the Japanese soldier interceded for him and summoned an interpreter to inquire about everything. The young man was able to escape the siege and safely carry the people to Shanghai. Along the way, he saw the corpses of men and women and farmers, still bleeding. Although this trip was only two hours long, the shock was not small.

### Defending Nanshi Has Supreme Significance

Commander Yang Gave a Speech Yesterday

Central News Agency reported that Yang Hu, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, gave an important speech to reporters yesterday in the midst of his busy military affairs, as follows: The Nanshi area is the foundation of Shanghai. Defending Nanshi means defending Shanghai. If Nanshi is not lost for a day, then Shanghai is not lost for a day. Therefore, our military and police forces are determined to defend it to the death, aiming to achieve the purpose of solid defense. Understanding this, one will know that the Nanshi resistance has supreme significance. Secondly, some people may say that the small area of Nanshi is ultimately indefensible. However, it is not known that in the Zhabei Sihang Warehouse, a tiny piece of land, our troops defended it to the death, and the enemy had no way to deal with us. Moreover, the Nanshi positions and food have been fully prepared for a long time. This small area is conducive to holding out in resistance, and our troops guarding this area have the determination to die. We believe that the results of the Nanshi resistance will definitely gain a supreme price. As for our responsibility to defend our territory, it is a matter of course, and there is no need to say more.

A bomb hit the Mingde Girls' School in Nancang Street, Dongjiadu, killing one girl. In addition, the Wenmiao Road and Menghua Street areas were hit by dozens of enemy artillery shells. All of the above-mentioned places are civilian houses with no stationed troops, and the enemy planes are indiscriminately bombing them. At the same time, Pudong was also running rampant and bombing, which is truly inhuman. Yesterday (the 10th), starting at dawn, enemy planes flew over Nanshi and Pudong, with as few as two or three planes at a time, and as many as five or six planes at a time, taking turns flying back and forth, circling and scouting. At about 10 AM, three enemy planes rampaged along the Waitan area on the Bund, shooting downwards with machine guns from time to time. At that time, there were two rice boats parked next to the Santai Wharf, and three boatmen were killed by machine gun bullets, and more than ten boatmen were injured. It is not known whether there were any deaths or injuries among passersby. At about 11 AM, another eight enemy heavy bombers flew to Gaochang Temple and other places and dropped bombs. At about 1 PM, eight enemy planes flew to the Rihui Port area and dropped bombs. More than a dozen planes circled over the Bund along the Huangpu River in Nanshi, and then dropped more than twenty bombs in Dongjiadu and Wangjia Wharf, killing and injuring many civilians. Also, the Shiliupu Police Station was bombed, killing and injuring more than a dozen policemen. A bomb hit a civilian house in Wangjia Wharf and started a fire, burning down two houses. Also, a cannon shell hit the Baoqin Rice Shop on the east side of Sanpailou Road, Zhaojiabang Road in the city, collapsing the front building of the house, and also injuring three women and one man on the road, all of whom were killed. In addition, an empty car, parked on the side of the road, was also bombed and destroyed. Also, a stray bullet hit a passerby on Wangyun Road, the south end of Zhaojiabang Road, who was seriously injured and died. Several others were slightly injured and were taken to Renji Hospital by the Fire Brigade ambulance.

At about 2 PM, more than a dozen enemy planes, divided into teams of two or three planes each, dropped more than ten bombs in the Damatou, Nanhui Hall, Wangjia Wharf, and Dongjiadu areas of Nanshi. Several houses were bombed, and some fell into the Huangpu River. The number of deaths and injuries is unknown. When enemy planes formed a team to bomb Nanshi, a piece of shrapnel flew into the office of the bailiff of the Special No. 2 Court on Xuhuali Road, shattering a glass window. Also, shrapnel fell on the open space in front of the registration office across the street, but fortunately no one was injured. Later, our troops opened fire with anti-aircraft guns, and the enemy planes fled to the northwest. Also, enemy planes dropped absurd leaflets in the Nanyang Bridge Ximen area.

Pudong: Yesterday, enemy planes circled and bombed a corner of Pudong all day long. At about 1 PM, a bomb was dropped on Tangmu Bridge. The bomb fell on the empty field of Dayi Middle School behind the Catholic Church, so there were no deaths or injuries because the students were in class at the time. At about 2 PM, two more bombs were dropped in Chuansha, one fell in Lakeside Park, injuring two people, and one fell next to a blacksmith shop on Nanmen Street. One customer was killed on the spot, and about seven or eight others were injured. At about 3 PM, two enemy planes spotted a refugee boat over Xinlu and dropped four bombs. Due to poor technology, none of them hit. The two planes then took turns strafing with machine guns. For a time, bullets flew everywhere, and six people were injured. At 4:30 PM, it was raining. In the drizzle, enemy planes were still soaring in the sky. Several planes flew to Lannima Wharf, dropped many heavy bombs, and opened fire with machine guns. Many people were injured in the bombing and were sent to Renji Hospital by the rescue team. Eight people were seriously injured and five people were slightly injured. Later, five bombs were dropped in Gong Town, and most of them hit busy areas in the town. One bomb hit a night boat that was full of passengers and was about to set sail. As a result, corpses were piled up in the river, and even more people were injured, about fifty or more, which was extremely tragic.

(10th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Jinan] Three enemy planes flew from Pingyuan to Luokou at about 8:00 a.m. on the 10th, intending to destroy our Yellow River Railway Bridge. They dropped several bombs in the area and on the north bank, injuring seven civilians in Luokou Street. They were then repelled by the intense fire of our air defense units.

⊙ Xinxiang: The 29th Army, since its reorganization, has vowed to restore Peiping and Tianjin as its own responsibility.

⊙ Xinxiang: Although the number of enemy troops invading northern Henan is not large, and they have been under heavy threat in the rear and on both wings due to our fierce counterattacks in recent days, the enemy's brutal acts in the occupied areas have aroused the indignation of our broad masses. More than ten counties in northern Henan have established mobilization committees one after another, arming no less than 300,000 civilians, who have successively joined the front line to resist the enemy. Moreover, compatriots in central Hebei, western Hebei, and northern Hebei, unable to bear the enemy's trampling, have risen up to resist. Everywhere, as our army has actively counterattacked and recaptured many towns, the compatriots in these areas have become more excited, raising the banner of righteousness, and those who respond are surging like a tide. It is reported that the righteous army in the counties belonging to Baoding, led by Tian and Wu, has more than 6,000 people, fully armed. The militia in a certain county in northern Hebei, led by Gao, has more than 5,000 people. Wei, leading more than 2,000 people along the Pingjin line, can all echo each other, posing a threat to the enemy. Their weapons are mostly obtained from guerrilla warfare. Similar actions are taking place everywhere else. At present, the active situation of the righteous army in Hebei Province is similar to that of the Northeast after the September 18th Incident.

It is believed that there are still six fighters flying above the bombers. The sound of anti-aircraft guns suddenly became loud, but because the Japanese planes were flying very high, they could not be hit. The Japanese planes then dropped four or five bombs at the flying field outside Guanghua Gate. According to a certain foreigner, he saw several Chinese fighters fighting with Japanese planes. At that time, the sound of machine guns was very rapid, but it is not known whether it came from the planes or from the ground firing at the sky. (Central News Agency 10th Reuters Dispatch)

In Fenhebian and Jiexiu Station alone, the number of people who were tragically slaughtered reached as many as five to six hundred. According to witnesses, the enemy planes bombed and strafed the above two places in particular. Corpses were piled up everywhere, and severed limbs and mutilated bodies were everywhere in sight.

Wang Gongs of Various Leagues and Banners Insist on Not Submitting

[Nanjing] After the enemy troops entered Suiyuan, they used their usual tricks of coercion and inducement, forcing the leagues and banners of Ximeng to break away from the Central Government. Last month, they convened the so-called "Inner Mongolia League and Banner Representatives Conference" to establish a puppet organization. However, according to reliable information, among the five ministries and thirteen banners under the jurisdiction of the Ulanqab and Ikhaod Leagues in Suiyuan, only the Wang Gongs of the Siziwang Banner and Xingmaoming'an Banner of the U League were forced to turn against them. Other ministries and banners, such as Zhonggong, Ushin, Otog, and Ulata, although under the threat of a strong enemy, still firmly refuse to submit. The Hangjin Banner even issued a telegram after the establishment of the pseudo-organization, expressing its support for the Central Government's bright attitude.

### Litvinov Returns to Moscow, Prospects for Brussels Conference Dim

Yesterday's Meeting Was Very Short, With Little Discussion, Waiting for Japan's Reply Until Saturday to Reconvene

⊙ Brussels: The Chairman of the Brussels Nine-Power Conference, Spaak, stated at the afternoon meeting today that he had received news from the Japanese government that Japan's reply to the application would arrive in Brussels on Friday. Upon hearing this, everyone decided to adjourn the meeting until 11:00 a.m. on Saturday to allow the representatives to have ample time to study Japan's reply. Thus, today's meeting adjourned at 3:45 p.m. However, before the adjournment, British Foreign Secretary Eden, Belgian Prime Minister Spaak, French Foreign Minister Delbos, US Representative Davis, Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun, and Soviet Ambassador to France Potemkin, successively delivered eulogies to former British Prime Minister MacDonald. (Central News Agency 10th Reuters Dispatch)

⊙ Brussels: The sudden departure of Litvinov, the chief Soviet representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, to Moscow has become the main topic of discussion among the representatives today. It is generally believed that Litvinov's departure is due to the fact that someone is agitating against the Soviet Union's inclusion in the small group of mediation committee to be established, and is therefore expressing his opposition by this means. Before his departure, Litvinov visited the chief American representative Davis and the chief British representative Eden. The Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin is still here and will serve as the chief Soviet representative. At the same time, the organization of the small group committee to deal with Japan's reply has been temporarily shelved. It is planned to decide how to deal with it after Japan's reply is received. Today, the European Armistice Commemoration will be held here, and a dinner will be held. Davis, Eden, and British Dominion Minister MacDonald will all attend. In addition to meeting with Litvinov yesterday, Eden also received Davis, Spaak, and Guo Taiqi. (Central 10th Reuters Dispatch)

Once the work of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference enters an active stage, and I must attend in person, I will still come here again. The matter of the organization of the small group committee must be submitted for discussion after Japan's reply is sent. It is too early to speak about it at the moment."

### British Foreign Secretary Carries Confidential Plan and Talks Lengthily with Davis

Therefore, this week, the conference will have an important decision on the fate of the Far East. It is said that London is still adopting the original plan of conducting negotiations with China and Japan through Britain, the United States, and Russia.

As soon as Eden arrived at the Capital Hotel, he held a lengthy talk with US Chief Representative Davis. It is believed that Eden will study a "formula" with the United States and France, and jointly take charge of the proceedings. (10th Haitong Dispatch)

### Jiang Baili Denies Outside Mediation to Quell Rumors

⊙ Brussels: Jiang Baili's trip to Germany has sparked rumors. In order to dispel doubts, Jiang declared today that this trip was intended to clarify China's true position in the war of resistance against Japan. The rumor that China is considering the efforts of a third party to mediate outside the Brussels Conference is not true. China has had direct negotiations with Japan for the past four or five years, but unfortunately, they have been fruitless. Therefore, the Chinese government firmly believes that direct negotiations between China and Japan cannot resolve this war and will only give Japan the opportunity to propose unreasonable conditions to impose on China. All conditions that China cannot accept, the signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty should also not accept. (Central News Agency 10th Reuters Dispatch)

[New York] After the rumor of German mediation in the Sino-Japanese dispute spread, the local newspapers already felt a negative impression. Recently, Italy has also joined the German-Japanese Anti-Communist Pact, and the newspapers are even more suspicious, saying that Italy's actions are to support Japan, so that it can continue to implement its expansionist policy towards China with cruel methods. The "New York Times" carried a report, stating that "The task of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is to safeguard the rights of all countries in the Far East and to maintain the status quo in the Far East. The Anti-Communist Pact formed by the three countries of Italy, Germany, and Japan is no different from an alliance treaty, and is sufficient to increase the difficulties of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference."

### Japan's Attitude is Stubborn, Saying it Will Tear Up the Treaty

[Tokyo] The opinion of the local newspapers today is that as a result of the plan set by the Beijing Conference, Japan will be forced to withdraw from the Nine-Power Treaty. The "Daily News" declares that Japan, in view of the current evolution of the situation, has made its withdrawal from the treaty inevitable. The Japanese Foreign Ministry is currently considering all aspects of this issue, determined to "abandon the shackles of the past." The newspaper also lists three results, all of which are sufficient to make Japan withdraw from the treaty: ㊀ If the conference explicitly defines Japan as an aggressor or confirms Japan as a treaty violator; ㊁ If the Brussels Conference cannot achieve any definite results, it will prove that the Nine-Power Treaty cannot be maintained; ㊂ If Japan's request to amend the treaty is rejected, Japan will decide to withdraw from this "outdated and unsuitable" treaty in any of the above three situations.

### British Prime Minister Chamberlain's Speech on the International Situation

Hopes for Practical Cooperation from the United States to Stop the Sino-Japanese War Soon

[London] Last night, the Mayor of London held a banquet at the City Council. Prime Minister Chamberlain gave an impromptu speech, discussing the Sino-Japanese situation. He stated that the British government believes the Brussels Conference has a very high hope of reaching an agreement on a ceasefire, so that a solution can be negotiated based on appropriate principles. The key factor in any attempt to achieve a solution is the cooperation of the United States. The protracted nature of the war only increases the losses of all major countries involved. Britain is now eager for all countries to resolve their differences and move towards consensus. The British government views the U.S. government's willingness to cooperate with other countries at the Brussels Conference as the most valuable first step towards implementing President Roosevelt's speech in Chicago. In his speech, President Roosevelt hoped that all peace-loving countries would work together to uphold the dignity of treaties and resolve international disputes peacefully. The British government deeply believes that closer understanding and more complete shared interests between Britain and the United States will greatly contribute to President Roosevelt's appeal. This appeal is highly aligned with Britain's aspirations. Chamberlain then discussed Britain's relationship with the two powers participating in the Rome-Berlin Axis, saying that the British government sincerely hopes that this relationship can be solidified on the basis of mutual friendship and understanding. He believes that such understanding will greatly contribute to the restoration of trust and security in Europe, and that informal discussions are more likely to succeed than public declarations. The Prime Minister also said that Britain must aim to strengthen the authority of the League of Nations. Finally, he described the astonishing progress in the world's overall economy since 1932. The Prime Minister concluded his speech on a hopeful note, saying, "I am confident that we will find a way to free the world from the pain of armaments and the panic caused by them, and open up a happier and more rational future for mankind."

### Molotov Declares the Soviet Union Needs Peace

Expresses Limitless Sympathy for Those Suffering Aggression

[Moscow] The Soviet People's Committee held a meeting on the 6th of this month, during which Committee Chairman Molotov issued a statement. He stated that the Soviet Union's sympathy for the Chinese people and its feelings about Japanese aggression can be demonstrated by the signing of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact. Soviet foreign policy has not changed. The Soviet Union needs peace and does not endorse foreign adventures. However, it is possible that certain fascist countries deliberately intend to involve our country in adventures. Therefore, we will always pay close attention to our military preparations. The Soviet Union has always expressed sympathy for all nations suffering from foreign aggression, so it is willing to support both Spain and China. However, it is surprising that no country has stepped forward to find a way to stop Japan's unprecedented act of aggression in China. (Central News Agency, 10th, Havas)

[Paris] The "Association of Friends of the Chinese People," organized by the French General Confederation of Labor, the People's Front parties, the French National Confederation of Veterans, and the World Committee Against War, a total of thirty-two organizations, held a meeting today and passed a resolution. It was immediately sent to the chief representatives of the nineteen countries at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. This resolution demands that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference confirm Japan's aggression against China and prohibit the supply of funds and raw materials to Japan. The resolution also stated that the economic and political power of the countries concerned is far superior to that of Japan. If they want to stop the aggression and restore peace in the Far East, it is easy. In addition, the Association of Friends of the Chinese People also decided to submit three requests to the French government: 1) Provide China with greater assistance; 2) Maintain China's maritime and land transportation with foreign countries; 3) The French representatives attending the Nine-Power Treaty Conference should support China's proposals.

(Central News Agency, 10th, Havas)

MacDonald's Brief Biography

James Ramsay MacDonald was born on October 15, 1866, in Lossiemouth, north of Moray, Scotland. His family was destitute when he was young, but fortunately, his grandmother, taught him strictly, so that he could barely finish his common studies. Later, he studied diligently and tirelessly, and finally acquired both learning and cultivation. At the age of twenty, MacDonald left his hometown for London. He had nothing but himself and had to work to make a living. He earned 15 shillings to a pound a week, and he had to send part of it back to Lossiemouth to support his family. During this period, MacDonald actively participated in the lives of workers, and his inclination towards socialism began at this time. MacDonald joined the labor movement, often giving speeches at workers' gatherings, gradually showing his talent. The labor movement had two major goals: to reduce working hours and increase wages. MacDonald's views were more far-reaching and aligned with modern socialism. In 1895, MacDonald participated in the election for a member of parliament for the first time in Southampton, but he failed. In 1900, he was elected secretary of the Labour Party. In the same year, he participated in the election in Leicester, but he failed again. In 1906, as the leader of the Independent Labour Party, he competed in Leicester again and finally won the election. He was a member of parliament for the city for twelve years. In 1911, he left the Independent Labour Party and became the leader of the orthodox Labour Party. After failing in the election in 1918, he was re-elected in Aberavon four years later. The following year, a cabinet crisis occurred, and MacDonald emerged to form a cabinet, serving as prime minister. This was the first Labour cabinet in British history. MacDonald had to obtain the support of the Liberal Party and deal with the various criticisms from the far left of the Labour Party, making the task very difficult. By 1924, the Labour Party's election was defeated, and he resigned. His relationship with the Labour Party became increasingly tense. As for domestic affairs, he advocated compromise on the transport workers' strike in 1926, thus openly conflicting with the General Confederation of Labour, which supported the strike. As for diplomacy, the party often criticized MacDonald for not having enough courage to implement the various principles he believed in. But MacDonald, having retired to the opposition, could constantly attack the government in the House of Commons, which greatly helped restore his past reputation. After five years of struggle, his position in the party gradually recovered, and he finally formed the second Labour cabinet in 1929. But the tide of economic panic had already become unstoppable. In July 1931, the Cabinet's Economic Committee announced that the budget deficit had reached a huge 120 million pounds, while the number of unemployed workers continued to increase. Although the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States lent 25 million pounds to the Bank of England in August, it was still a drop in the bucket. The Economic Committee concluded that the only way to remedy the situation was to implement austerity policies. MacDonald immediately expressed his support. At this point, all members of the Labour Party's cabinet believed that it was difficult to continue cooperation because they opposed the method of reducing wages, so they resigned on August 21, and the cabinet crisis occurred. Later, King George V hurriedly returned to Beijing from Balmoral Palace and urgently summoned MacDonald, Conservative Party leader Baldwin, and Liberal Party leader Samuel for consultation. The next day, MacDonald was ordered to form a National Cabinet. The late Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Snowden, proposed the so-called emergency budget in the House of Commons on September 10. On the 21st of that month, the British government also announced the abandonment of the gold standard. On October 10, elections were held in the House of Commons, and the Conservative Party won a majority. Only MacDonald and Lansbury were re-elected as members of the National Labour Party, so MacDonald's Labour Party leader was largely a nominal title. By November 1935, he was suffering from eye disease and had to rely on the Conservative Party in the House of Commons. He requested resignation on the grounds that he could not cope physically. Conservative Party leader Baldwin took the opportunity to form a cabinet. In order to maintain the nature of the National Cabinet, he still served as Lord President of the Council as the leader of the National Labour Party.

### A Strategic Masterpiece

— Yi

Our army in Shanghai West has retreated. The enemy concentrated on landing on the Jinshanwei area has disturbed the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line. But in the sense of a war of attrition, the Shanghai battle can be said to be quite successful.

From the beginning of the war, our military authorities realized that Shanghai could not be defended for long. This area, because it was subject to the restrictions of the truce agreement, could not be used for national defense arrangements in peacetime. It is conceivable how difficult it would be to rely solely on temporary defensive works to resist the full-scale offensive of the enemy's naval, land, and air forces. However, for the sake of national glory, political and economic relations, and to deplete the enemy's strength, we decided to hold Shanghai firmly. We have defended this indefensible place for three months, and now Nanshi is still in our hands. Isn't this something we should be proud of?

Moreover, our army has never been poisoned by the enemy's tricks of sneak attacks or encirclement. Every retreat has been very quick, very calm, and very orderly. Even the recent sneak attack by the enemy in Jinshanwei cannot be said to be entirely due to our army's negligence. Because the prior withdrawal of our main force in that direction, like the retreat of our army in Shanghai West, was clearly based on a pre-determined strategy by our military authorities. The essence of this strategy lies in concentrating the main force and fighting a war of attrition with the enemy.

Foreign military observers have called the retreat of our army in Shanghai West this time a "strategic masterpiece." (See yesterday's English-language "China Press") Our military authorities truly deserve this praise.

### Unity First

— Hu Yuzhi

In the past few days, some new military changes have taken place on the northern and southern battlefields. In the suburbs of Shanghai, our troops, with the exception of a portion who are defending Nanshi to the death, have mostly begun to retreat to a new line of defense in Kunshan, Songjiang, and Jiaxing. Our troops in North China have also withdrawn from Taiyuan and are expanding mobile warfare throughout Shanxi Province. In terms of the overall war situation, this military change cannot be regarded as a failure. Because our troops in Shanghai have withdrawn from the enemy's naval fire line and are holding a second line of national defense with stronger defensive works, in terms of military effect, it is absolutely advantageous to us. As for the fall of Taiyuan, it was already expected. Moreover, the deeper the enemy penetrates, the more difficult it will be to control the entire war situation in North China. In the sense of depleting the enemy's strength, there is no need to be pessimistic.

Even if we take a step back and say that we have already experienced a failure, this failure is natural and was expected. In the long-term war of resistance against Japan, we will inevitably experience multiple failures, not just once or twice, but possibly ten or a hundred times. We originally did not want to rely on military superiority to defeat the enemy, but on our nation's determination to resist the war to eliminate the enemy. Therefore, our final victory must be accumulated from ten or a hundred failures. Failure is not terrible, what is terrible is that we ourselves are not resolute and that we are not united internally. But unity is more important than resoluteness, because if we are not united internally, we will definitely not be able to resolutely resist the war to the end.

Unity is everything. If we are not united internally, we will never have this war of resistance. During the September 18th Incident, we could not launch a war of resistance because we were not united internally. The January 28th War was abandoned halfway because we were not yet united. This time we were able to mobilize the strength of the whole country to fight a decisive battle with the Japanese bandits because we have already united internally. In terms of the situation on the northern and southern battlefields, our army in Shanghai has shown extraordinary bravery and created an unprecedented record of victory in military terms. This is because on the eastern battlefield, the command is absolutely unified, and the unity between the army and the people, and between the people and the government, is also relatively strong. On the contrary, the several defeats in the war in North China were mostly due to the lack of unified command and the lack of strong unity.

Unity against foreign aggression is an old saying. But precisely because it is an old saying, it is easy to be ignored by the general public. Although in times of extreme urgency, some narrow-minded people often forget the meaning of unity due to temporary personal impulses. All past grievances should have been completely abandoned, but because the infection is already deep, it may sometimes reappear in the heart. In addition, the enemy and traitors are always shooting cold arrows and scheming, using every opportunity to undermine our internal unity. It doesn't matter if the military is winning victories, but whenever there are military setbacks or changes in the situation, the general public is easily shaken. Therefore, in the midst of the war of resistance, the enemy's planes, cannons, and poison gas, no matter how terrible, are definitely not more terrible than the conspiracies and tricks that undermine unity. Because planes, cannons, and poison gas can only destroy part of our positions, while conspiracies and tricks that undermine unity can cancel our will to resist the war and put us in a situation of eternal damnation.

There are thousands of conspiracies and tricks that the enemy uses to undermine our internal unity, but the main ones are no more than two methods: using the words "communist" and "red" to provoke and alienate our upper-level elements, and inciting our people to stand against the government. Both of these methods are very clumsy. Anyone who is slightly sensible will neither believe that the result of the war of resistance will lead to communism, nor will they advocate standing against the government when the country is in serious trouble. But all those who are naive, narrow-minded, and value personal interests above all else, will often be shaken by this kind of provocation. If they are shaken about the future of the war of resistance, they will intentionally or unintentionally reveal the idea of compromise halfway through. If one person doesn't matter, two people don't matter, but if hundreds or thousands of people advocate compromise halfway through, the enemy's provocation and tricks will achieve their goals.

Chairman Chiang clearly instructed us: "We already understood the greatness of the power of national unity and national unification when the war of resistance began. We must show our unity and strengthen our unity even more in the midst of the war of resistance." If even today, when the war of resistance is continuing to progress in the process of victory, there are still people who mistakenly believe that the war of resistance will lead to communism and therefore hesitate to move forward, or if there are still people who oppose the government and therefore passively shirk their duties, it is tantamount to carrying out the enemy's orders to undermine our unity. For the sake of the future of the nation and the country, this kind of psychology of national destruction must be eradicated.

We are not afraid of failure, and we are not afraid of difficulties. We must be prepared to deal with all failures and difficulties, and what we must not forget for a moment is "unity first."

### Dutch Sailor's Letter Describes Tense Situation in Japan

Son of Tea Merchant Opposes War and Commits Suicide; Prices Soar, Market Abnormally Depressed

Recently, we received a letter from a crew member of a Dutch merchant ship, describing what he saw and heard during his passage through Japan. According to the letter, the ship regularly sails between the South Seas islands and Japan. Excerpts are as follows:

The ship passed through Miike Port, Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya, Yokohama, and other ports. Before August 13th, foreign crew members could freely disembark. However, this time, landing was completely prohibited, and security was tight, preventing any deviation. Every night, fearing air raids by our air force, all lights were extinguished on land and sea, creating a very terrifying situation, turning the prosperous commercial ports into a dark world.

The Japanese authorities have detained hundreds of merchant ships from the sailor's country, using them to transport troops and supplies. Troop movements at various ports are exceptionally hurried. Twenty to thirty transport ships set sail daily. Each ship only stayed at the dock for three to four hours before loading up again and departing. The situation is extremely tense.

Chinese residents in Japan are returning to China in droves. Those who are economically well-off are mostly transferring to various ports in the South Seas. They spoke in detail on the ship about the situation in Japan.

The Japanese military is forcibly conscripting merchants and civilians. Anyone receiving a conscription notice must report immediately. Those who fail to report on time will be executed on the spot. There have been instances of merchants and civilians committing suicide to avoid conscription. The son of a tea merchant in Tokyo was among those conscripted. However, he opposed the war and committed suicide to avoid service. Before his suicide, he told people that whether he was conscripted or not, he would die anyway, and that dying by suicide at home was better than dying in Shanghai.

It is estimated that only over two million people in Japan are registered for military service. From before the Marco Polo Bridge Incident to September 15th, approximately one million troops have been transported to North China and Shanghai to fight. After September 15th, the number transported would not have been small. Over three hundred political figures have been arrested for opposing the war.

Domestic prices have soared, increasing by fifty percent compared to normal times. The market is depressed, and people are in disarray. Because of the excessive deaths of those conscripted to fight in China, the Taishu Shato party has raised questions, demanding that the government resolve and respond to: (1) the issue of relief for the families of soldiers on expeditions, and (2) how to remedy the high prices. The government has been unable to resolve and respond.

Japan is a newly emerging industrial nation, relying entirely on foreign trade as its lifeblood. Since the outbreak of war, foreign trade has plummeted, and the economy is in extreme distress. The financial system is fundamentally shaken, foreign exchange is prohibited, raw material imports have ceased, and almost all factories have shut down. Workers who are not suffering from the pain of conscription are also suffering from the worry of unemployment. Their resentment and hatred toward the authorities' militaristic policy are overflowing.

### Residents of Caohejing Town Scattered and Displaced

City Committee Sends Refugees to Evacuate; Enemy Forces Occupy, Gaining Nothing

At 4:00 AM on the 9th, it was learned that our positions on the south bank of the Suzhou River were being withdrawn for strategic reasons. The local government in Caohejing Town in western Shanghai, being in a vital location, had to prepare for evacuation. The City Committee of the area supervised all members of the defense corps to notify residents of the entire town to assemble urgently. Rescue trucks were used to transport women, children, and the elderly to Shanghai first. Men walked in formation, reluctantly leaving the town around 7:00 AM, heading east along Xietu Road to temporary shelters in Houjiabang Jishen Temple, Guangfu Temple, and Zijin Elementary School inside Xinbei Gate. An estimated four to five hundred refugees were rescued. However, due to the limited number of vehicles and the large number of people, not everyone could be transported. Along the way, they were hit by stray bullets, causing deaths and injuries along Caoxi Road and Xietu Road, which was shocking. In addition, more than ten enemy aircraft pursued and strafed, causing rumors to spread like bees and people to panic. The reporter was fortunate to escape unharmed amidst the flying bullets, feeling as if he had been reborn.

On the 10th, someone who escaped from Caohejing Town in western Shanghai said that on the morning of the 9th, more than ten enemy aircraft bombed the town, destroying many houses. A bomb hit the police station next to Wanshou Nunnery, and Jinrong Bridge was also bombed and broken. By the afternoon, enemy troops were spotted in the town and Longhua at the same time, and they were immediately burned and massacred. The residence of Yang Xiaomao in Yangjiagang, Gangnan, caught fire and burned. Doors and windows of shops in the town were all opened, and internal losses were considerable. Nearby villagers, unable to escape in time, were brutally killed, about a dozen of them. Among them, Zhang Jinxiang and Zhang Qiulin's wives were shot and their bodies abandoned on the road. The Yang residence in the town has been occupied by the enemy's headquarters. Fortunately, the residents fled, so although the enemy occupied the area, they gained nothing.

### German Newspaper Praises the Effectiveness of Our Military's Resistance

Japan Forced to Concentrate Main Forces on China, Spending Huge Expenditures

National Maritime News Agency Frankfort, 10th - The Frankfurter Zeitung published a long article today, praising the loyalty and bravery of the Chinese army. The article believes that the Chinese army's ability to resist the Japanese army, which is superior in equipment and weaponry, for three months is "a military achievement worthy of the highest praise." The newspaper continued, although the Chinese army's retreat in Shanghai was a major blow to the patriotic emotions of the Chinese people, it is by no means enough to diminish the special meritorious service of the Chinese army's long-term resistance. The newspaper pointed out that the Japanese army has repeatedly attempted to break through the Chinese line of defense, but has failed. The courage and determination of each Chinese soldier exceeds the Shanghai battle five years ago by an immeasurable degree. It continued, China's months of resistance have not been in vain, because Japan has been forced to concentrate its main forces on China and spend huge expenditures in order to achieve some success. The heroism and bravery of the Chinese army has been announced to the whole world, and the Chinese people are willing to sacrifice to protect the independence of their country.

### All Circles Exert Efforts to Purchase National Salvation Bonds

Rent Used to Offset Bond Purchases; Still Subject to Deliberation and Verification

Using rent to offset purchases of National Salvation Bonds has been widely publicized for a long time, but has not yet been implemented. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Fundraising Corps received a letter from the First Special District Citizens' Federation requesting permission for tenants to purchase bonds on behalf of landlords, using the rent receipt from the most recent month. The corps forwarded the letter to the General Association for instructions. The General Association has now replied, stating that the matter should be handled in accordance with the actual social situation and after careful deliberation and verification.

Business Circles Corps

The National Salvation Bond Fundraising Corps for Business Circles yesterday received reports from various industry sub-teams regarding the amount of bonds subscribed, as follows: insurance industry, fourth batch, 15,335 yuan; coal industry, sixth batch, 18,280 yuan; fundraising committee member Ye Youcai, 20,150 yuan; construction industry, sixth batch, 4,200 yuan; foreign firms' tea, third batch, 3,810 yuan; tung oil and ramie, third batch, 2,500 yuan; paper industry, ninth batch, 2,250 yuan; gold industry, sixth batch, 539 yuan; cotton industry, sixth batch, 2,000 yuan; tea-making industry, third batch, 500 yuan; copper, iron, and machinery, third batch, 310 yuan; barber industry, second batch, 260 yuan; steel bars and scrap iron, tenth batch, 295 yuan; restaurant industry, third batch, 200 yuan; advertising industry, third batch, 100 yuan. The total is 70,720 yuan. As of today, the total amount raised is 18,655,852.83 national currency.

Jardine Matheson Chinese Employees

Chinese employees of British firm Jardine Matheson, seeing the rampant atrocities of Japanese invaders and the severity of the national crisis, decided to economize and purchase National Salvation Bonds to fulfill their duty as people in the rear to defend the country. Yesterday, the general manager of the Chinese staff, Mr. Pan Zhiquan, took the lead by subscribing 5,000 yuan; his brother Zhiheng, 1,000 yuan; Pan Yuchu, 300 yuan; Bao Guochang and Li Yunan, 200 yuan each; Lin Ruixiang, Zheng Yiqiao, Ouyang Shaotang, and Jin Zuochen, 100 yuan each; Fei Xiaohou, Wu Zhongdong, and Ou Junxiang, 50 yuan each; Li Bianxiang, 30 yuan; and Zhong Jibiao and others, totaling several thousand yuan. It is heard that Mr. Pan Zhiquan is naturally charitable. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, in addition to raising funds for bonds, he independently established a wounded soldier hospital, complete with internal facilities.

Hospitalized Wounded Soldiers

All the wounded soldiers residing in the Cilianhui Relief Committee for War Zone Refugees Rescue Hospital, in view of the fact that the fundraising for National Salvation Bonds has not yet reached half the amount, which is sufficient to affect the future of the war, although they are temporarily unable to return to the front to kill the enemy, their heart to save the country is still not behind others. They consulted and agreed to fast for one day, using the saved food expenses to subscribe for National Salvation Bonds. The hospital director, Mr. Huang Dinghu, deeply admired their enthusiasm for saving the country. However, fasting would harm their health and indirectly affect the strength of the war effort. Therefore, Mr. Huang led all the staff to donate 188 yuan to purchase National Salvation Bonds, replacing the wounded soldiers' fasting, and reported the situation to the committee. The committee highly praised the patriotic enthusiasm of the wounded soldiers and all the hospital staff.

Hardware Industry

Since the establishment of the National Salvation Bond Sub-Team by the Shanghai Metal Parts Industry Association, Captain Yu Wenbiao and others have worked hard to promote it, encouraging all members to purchase bonds. All members enthusiastically subscribed. The association's predetermined goal was 10,000 yuan, and it has now exceeded the predetermined goal, with a total of more than 15,000 yuan raised.

Donating Platinum Rings

The National Salvation Bond Fundraising Association yesterday received two platinum rings donated by Mr. Yu Peng from the Jiangsu Provincial Branch to offset the purchase of bonds. They were immediately forwarded to the Central Bank in their original packaging, requesting a foreign jewelry store to estimate the price and offset it accordingly.

### Foreign Firms' Chinese Employees Association Collects Gloves

The Foreign Firms' Chinese Employees Association, in view of our loyal and brave soldiers fighting the enemy in bloody battles, launched a glove collection campaign. After appealing to all members to actively donate, it is now known that more than 400 yuan have been raised, which can make about a thousand pairs of good gloves. The association is now stepping up production in order to send them to the front lines for soldiers to keep warm.

### Slight Increase in Prices in the City

Temporary Excitement Can Be Calmed; Concession Authorities Already Have Measures

Prices in the city have slightly risen yesterday. One national currency can only buy one catty and seven ounces of pork. Due to the changing situation in western Shanghai, it is relatively inconvenient to bring vegetables into the concession area. The wholesale prices of fuel products such as firewood and coal have also shown an upward trend. However, the supply of the above items is smooth, and there is no shortage. The rise in market prices is only a temporary excitement and a temporary phenomenon, which can be calmed. In addition, a few rice shops have slightly reduced their inventory and temporarily closed yesterday morning. It is heard that the concession authorities have prepared good measures and are making every effort to maintain the situation.

### Refugees Fleeing from Southern Shanghai and Pudong to Concessions

Red Swastika Society and City Boy Scouts Work Hard to Rescue and Send People

Since the implementation of the refugee zone in the southern city area yesterday (9th), the Red Cross flags of the International Relief Committee have been flying in the wind in places such as Lao Bei Men and Minguo Road. Shops in the area had opened for business yesterday. Today, because refugees from the areas of Rihui Port, Fenglin Bridge, and Xietu Road gathered like ants, shops on Minguo Road and other places closed again today. The iron gate connecting Lao Bei Men to the concession was flooded with refugees. The French Concession authorities specially dispatched Chinese and French police, as well as detectives, to stand inside and outside the iron fence, making every effort to maintain order, so that refugees could walk shoulder to shoulder in an orderly manner. Those carrying cages and packages were prohibited from entering the concession. Those with suspicious behavior were subjected to inspection. The reporter then went to Nanyang Bridge to inspect. The situation at the iron gate connecting to the French Concession was no less crowded and noisy than at Lao Bei Men. It is heard that the Xieqiao iron gate has been closed due to the situation. Therefore, the actual passages from the southern city area to the concession are only the above two places.

Also, after our army withdrew from western Shanghai, some troops remained to defend the southern city area, confronting the enemy across Rihui Port. Starting at dawn today, enemy aircraft flew over the southern city area for reconnaissance and indiscriminate bombing. Although the refugee area in the southern city area is still stable, there are still many residents south of the refugee area, numbering no less than hundreds of thousands of people. Since the 9th, they have been rushing to the French Concession to take refuge. There were even more people seeking refuge this morning. At the iron gates of Nanyang Bridge and Lao Bei Men, the crowds waiting to enter the concession were overwhelming. The French authorities stipulated that the Nanyang Bridge side would only allow people to exit the concession and refused entry. The Lao Bei Men side remained open as usual. Therefore, Lao Bei Men was a scene of surging crowds.

The Red Swastika Society's relief team learned yesterday morning that many refugees had fled from western Shanghai, the southern city area, and the Pudong area, gathering at various wharves at the new customs, the Bund outside the Public Concession, Fenglin Bridge, the areas adjacent to the French Concession, the rice wharves in the southern city area, and the iron fences of the French Concession, carrying luggage, supporting the old and helping the young, sobbing and calling, which was extremely miserable. They immediately increased the number of ambulances. The entire team set out and rushed to the various places, rescuing refugees in shifts. From morning to night, they rescued more than 5,700 people. In addition to those who went to relatives and friends, they also sheltered hundreds of people. At the same time, they also rescued more than 120 wounded soldiers and sent them to the Fourth Hospital for treatment.

In recent days, residents of the Pudong area, because of the rumors that spread after our army withdrew from western Shanghai, have been crossing the Huangpu River to seek refuge. Order at the wharves is particularly chaotic. All the members of the Shanghai City Boy Scout Wartime Service First Regiment stationed in Pudong served day and night at the wharves, and escorted refugees across the river. The refugees were very grateful. Yesterday, refugees gathered at the entrance of the French Concession in Lujiawan, their miserable suffering causing heartbreak. Members of the Shanghai City Boy Scout Seventh District Regiment requested assistance from the French Municipal Council, who sympathized and provided large trucks to transport the refugees to various shelters. This shows the French Concession authorities' efforts to uphold humanitarianism.

### After the Implementation of the Refugee Area, Gather to Discuss Reorganization Measures

International Relief Committee Sent Letters to Various Groups Yesterday; Joint Discussion at YMCA Today

The Shanghai International Relief Committee, after consultation with our municipal authorities, agreed to designate a refugee area in the southern city area, which was implemented on the 9th. However, the overall reception and liaison matters within the area urgently need to be coordinated. Therefore, the committee has decided to convene a meeting of various receiving groups at the YMCA this afternoon to discuss the matter. The following is an excerpt from its circular: Dear Sir/Madam, We have learned that your organization has established a shelter in the southern city area, showing great enthusiasm for relief work, which is admirable. In order to facilitate communication and study how to reorganize good measures, we have specially scheduled a joint discussion on the 11th of this month (Thursday) at 4:00 PM in the conference room on the third floor of the YMCA in Eight Immortals Bridge. In addition to sending letters to various charitable groups, please send a representative from your organization to attend the meeting for guidance. Your presence is greatly anticipated.

The International Committee held a meeting at its office yesterday to discuss the safety of residents in the southern city area. It was decided to send personnel to be stationed at the committee permanently to handle all matters and ensure the safety of residents.

### Slight Changes in Foreign Exchange After Our Army's Defense Line Changes

British and American Exchange Rates Have Contracted; Central and HSBC Exchange Rates Remain Unchanged

After our army withdrew from Zhabei, there were slight changes in the local foreign exchange market. Foreign banks and Japanese banks absorbed together, and the U.S. dollar once softened due to stimulation. By November 2nd, it had tightened to 29.40625 yuan. However, the British pound was still hovering around 1 shilling 2 pence 25. Starting on November 4th, there were sudden changes in the foreign market, and the British and American exchange rates rose by about six points, breaking through the 5 U.S. dollar mark. As a result, the local foreign exchange market also showed a trend of tightening for the British pound and easing for the U.S. dollar. The British pound tightened from 1 shilling 2 pence 25 to 1 shilling 2 pence 1875. Foreign banks and firms such as Xinfeng were hedging, but fortunately, traffic and other sources supplied them, and the overall situation was still supportable. Although there was a large amount of kerosene settlement for the U.S. dollar, Japanese and American dealers were spitting out a lot, so it eased from 29.40625 yuan to 29.6875 yuan. After our army withdrew from the defense line in western Shanghai the day before yesterday, although there was a tight trend in the foreign exchange market, the biggest reason for this was that the British and American exchange rates had contracted. Yesterday, swap transactions in the foreign exchange market were quite lively. Formal transactions included the British pound for November at 1 shilling 2 pence 15625, and the U.S. dollar at around 29.5625 yuan. The swap rate was 125 for the shilling and 3125 for the U.S. dollar. Yesterday's closing prices were: British pound spot at 1 shilling 2 pence 25, November at 140625, December at 015625; U.S. dollar spot at 9.53125 yuan, November at 46875, December at 15625. As for the exchange rates of the Central Bank and HSBC for the British pound and U.S. dollar, they remained stable and unchanged.

### Fujian Fellow Provincial Association Sends Telegram to Military Affairs Commission and Fujian Provincial Government to Severely Punish the Jinmen County Magistrate

And Provide Generous Pensions to Martyred Strong Men

The Fujian Fellow Provincial Association in Shanghai held a meeting yesterday at its office at No. 64 Jing'an Villa. Jiang Yinan, Wang Pingnan, Chen Zhenming, Chi Lingfei, Weng Xingyu, and dozens of others attended. Jiang Yinan, director of the preparatory committee, presided over the meeting. They discussed the solicitation of affairs officers and the proposal by Chen Zhenming, supervisor of the association, that the fall of Jinmen and the sacrifice of all the strong men under enemy fire for their country should be compared to the Spartan guards and Yao Ying of Baoshan County. The magistrate of the county, Zheng Han, abandoned the city and survived and is now being detained. They should send a telegram to the Military Affairs Commission and the Fujian Provincial Government to punish him to the fullest extent of the law, commend them, and provide generous pensions to the martyred strong men to praise their heroic deeds. The resolution was passed and telegraphed separately yesterday.

### Domestic Manufacturers Stop Enemy Goods

Telegraph to National Agencies to Maintain Long-Term Resistance

The Shanghai Chinese Domestic Manufacturers Association telegraphed to chambers of commerce, anti-enemy support associations, and agencies and public groups in all provinces, cities, and counties across the country, saying: (Omitted titles) Since the violent enemy invaded, the people were motivated by patriotism and implemented economic severance from Japan. The Japanese devils have no plans to show, so they change the appearance of inferior goods, impersonate domestic goods, or European and American goods, collude with traitors, obscure and invade sales. Customs at various places have repeatedly seized them, but with their myriad schemes, they mix the said changed enemy goods into the inland to seek sales, which is still unavoidable. At this juncture of national survival and ethnic life and death, economic resistance is no less important than military resistance. Therefore, we specially telegraph your association to block the enemy goods invading the inland, issue interceptions, and detain any suspicious goods. If you have any questions, our association will inform you of what we know at any time. It concerns the foundation of the country and maintains long-term resistance. We hope you will agree to strictly prohibit enemy goods and not allow any expectations. The Chinese Domestic Manufacturers Association bows, ash.

### Ministry of Industry Orders Investigation of Factory Losses

Estimate Losses and Damage; Report to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in Writing

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Ministry of Industry ordering factories to quickly report wartime losses and issued a public announcement saying: Received Qing telegram from the Ministry of Industry saying that the situation of factories destroyed in Shanghai needs to be ascertained, and that the names of factories destroyed before November 1 with capital of more than 200,000 yuan, loss estimates, and dates of destruction should be investigated immediately and telegraphed for reply. In addition to the association issuing letters to other public associations to investigate and report, for quickness, it is re-announced to the public. It is hoped that the owners of the factories will report the estimated losses and destruction in writing to the association on their own accord so that they can be telegraphed. Do not delay. This is the public announcement.

### Situation of Nanhui County Town Being Bombed

East Main Street Was Damaged; Zhoupu Also Was Bombed

Dr. Qu of Nanhui Public Hospital came to Shanghai from Nanhui yesterday and said that at about 10:00 AM on (the 7th), three enemy aircraft came and circled over the county town several times before dropping four massive bombs. One landed in the garden of the County Junior Girls' Middle School in the city and did not explode. One landed on the back of the school building, destroying a clock tower, but the school building was not affected. Fortunately, the school had already suspended classes, and the students had all dispersed home, so no one was injured. There were still two bombs that landed in the most lively section of East Main Street in the city. The area was hit by a lot of shops. Dozens of shops of all sizes, including Huang Changyu Grain Store, Xubinyuan Restaurant, Wanbaoyuan Pickles, Pinlian Native Products Store, Zhengjie Restaurant, Quan Da Meat Shop, Deyu Salted Goods Shop, and Ronghua Photo Studio, were all destroyed. Many nearby houses were also collapsed by the shock. More than a dozen people were killed and about thirty injured. Among them, Ronghua Photo Studio was opened by Wang Hongzhang. Hongzhang happened to be away on business and was not injured, but his wife and five children were killed. It was very tragic. The local rescue team sent the injured to the public hospital for treatment. The dead were buried by their families, and those without families were buried by the charity association. Most of the residents of Nanhui have now moved, and only a few poor people remain. The larger towns and cities near Nanhui have also been bombed. Zhoupu Town was bombed with more than a dozen bombs, and Shangnan Station, Xishi, and Beishi were bombed, destroying houses and injuring people.

### No Absolute Shortage of Rice in the City

700,000 Piculs of Rice in Storage and Continuous Purchases from Outside; Rice Industry Association Cracks Down on Taking the Opportunity to Raise Rice Prices

Because our national army moved to a new line of defense and traffic to the concession was obstructed, the price of rice in the city rose sharply again yesterday. Several rice shops even closed their doors, and people could not avoid being affected. The Hua Dong News Agency reporter met with Mr. Gu, a leader in the city's food industry, yesterday afternoon. He asked the reporter to inform the citizens not to panic. There are still 700,000 piculs of rice in storage, and food groups have been selecting and transporting from inland. The reporter personally saw many rice merchants from the interior say that 300,000 piculs of new japonica rice were concentrated and waiting to be transported, which will arrive in Shanghai soon. It is also learned that the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession are also very concerned about the rice problem for Chinese and foreign citizens and are planning to purchase from Hong Kong, Saigon, Siam, and other places. As for yesterday's chaotic situation, it was caused by a few rice merchants secretly raising prices, but the amount of rice in storage is still very sufficient.

According to reliable sources from the Public Works Department, rice merchants have ordered a batch of rice from abroad during the past week, which will soon be available for residents of the city to eat. All the ordered goods have been loaded and transported to Shanghai, which will be enough for three or four weeks. The existing rice in stock in the city is also enough to support for three weeks. Therefore, the rice supply in the city is quite sufficient, and there is no shortage.

The Shanghai Rice Industry Association believes that at this extraordinary time, the people's food is of great importance. Since the end of the People's Food Adjustment Association, some rice merchants have taken the opportunity to raise rice prices. Therefore, it convened an emergency meeting to decide that the prices sold by the same industry should comply with the regulations of the People's Food Association, and should not exceed 14 yuan per picul, in order to maintain the people's food. The Rice and Bean Industry Association announced that all rice shops should follow this, saying: Dear Sirs, at this extraordinary time, the people's food is of utmost importance. All rice market prices should still comply with the previous regulations of the People's Food Adjustment Association, and the selling price should not exceed 14 yuan per picul. All rice shops in the city should abide by this, regardless of whether they are buying or selling, and it is hoped that merchants with goods will understand this intention. If there is any transgression, once it is discovered and verified, it will be reported to the local authorities for severe punishment. It is hoped that all colleagues will pay close attention. This announcement is hereby made.

### Cultural Street Since the War of Resistance (Part 1)

— Huai Qing

Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, Shanghai's publishing industry, like the entire city, has fallen into a state of stagnation. The direct and indirect losses have been very significant. Later, as people's hearts gradually stabilized and the market gradually recovered, Cultural Street slowly revived, with the exception of two anti-war publications decorating the silent streets. However, apart from the anti-war pictorials, magazines, and various pamphlets that emerged in response to the times, the publishing industry as a whole was naturally just struggling to cope with this extraordinary period! Now, based on my limited observations, I will give an overview of the situation on Cultural Street since the War of Resistance.

㊀ Dynamics of Bookstores

The Commercial Press, the "trust" of the national publishing industry, suffered the greatest losses during the January 28th Incident. The general printing plant on Baoshan Road and the Oriental Library were completely destroyed by artillery fire, resulting in a six-month suspension of operations. After resuming business, it implemented scientific management and was determined to innovate, and its business gradually prospered. Last year, its business was particularly successful, clearly exceeding the pre-war situation. Taking January to August 14th of this year as an example, in addition to publishing a large number of textbooks and large series of books, the number of new books published daily alone reached 745, totaling 1,009 volumes. Last year, the entire year saw only over 800 titles.

The experience gained by the Commercial Press from the first artillery fire and the lessons learned from the labor disputes after the war have made them particularly meticulous in their administrative organization. In addition to establishing a general plant in Hong Kong, the factories in Shanghai have also been set up in a decentralized manner. Therefore, the direct losses suffered by Shanghai in this war are truly insignificant compared to the January 28th Incident. Although the publication of books was suspended in the second half of August and throughout September, new books and various magazines were continuously printed from October onwards, albeit with a slight reduction in quality and quantity.

The weekly special-priced books announced this year are still being sold, but the discount has been changed from 30% to 20%. The weekly standard books have been discontinued. From October 1st, the daily output of new books is temporarily set at one title per day. As for magazines, the ones that resumed publication in October are *The Eastern Miscellany*, *Education Magazine*, *Children's World*, and *English Weekly*, but due to paper and manpower constraints, they are temporarily published as combined issues every two issues. It is also understood that *Young Pictorial* and *Children's Pictorial* will also be republished within this month.

*Literature Magazine*, a large-scale art publication, is a new publication that inherits the *Fiction Monthly*. It has a fresh face and holds a unique position. It has many categories and is rigorously produced; it is very different from the current popular literary publications. It is a miracle worthy of attention! Unfortunately, it only published four issues before the cruel artillery fire wiped it out, along with other magazines!

The China Book Company published a "Special Period Newspaper Book" very early on. After the outbreak of the war, it was very popular with readers, and the retail department was quite lively. However, they have not published a new book in the past three months. Even the seven magazines they publish only saw news of resumption at the beginning of this month; and only *Teenage Weekly*, *Children's Weekly*, and *China English Weekly* were resumed. Moreover, they are also published as combined issues of two issues.

It is said that not long ago, a large number of books from the China Book Company were transported to other ports, divided into five civilian ships. Unfortunately, they were bombed by enemy aircraft midway, and all were destroyed. This is truly a heartbreaking thing!

The entire printing factories of the Kaiming and World Book Companies are located in enemy war zones, and the losses are very significant. Magazines such as *Middle School Student* and *New Youth* of the Kaiming Bookstore have not been able to resume publication until now. Even *Monthly Report*, which competes with *Digest* and is most popular with readers, has had to temporarily suspend publication.

While various bookstores were deploying and reorganizing in a chaotic situation, the Life Bookstore took this opportunity to become very active, quickly setting up a retail department in the Kangjian Bookstore on Avenue Joffre. More than a dozen titles in the *World Knowledge* series were all works that grasped the current era, and business was indeed not bad.

㊁ Street Bookstalls

Liangyou Pictorial Company, which started with pictorials and turned to specializing in literary works, had its distribution department, warehouses, etc., all located on North Sichuan Road, in the enemy's artillery fire. Although some were moved out, most were sacrificed. Afterwards, thieves risked sneaking into the book warehouse and stole a large number of books, selling them at low prices. For a time, there were bookstalls everywhere on the roads, and the bookstalls were full of colorful and brand-new Liangyou Literary Series and Liangyou Library, etc. Ordinary literary youth, as if they had obtained treasures to buy and collect, competed to buy them, searching everywhere. For one or two yuan in legal tender, they could return fully loaded. The booksellers also made a threefold profit. Customers and sellers both benefited, but Liangyou Company secretly suffered no small loss.

The headquarters of these bookstalls were in two places, one at the intersection of Avenue Road and Carter Road, and the other in the area of Avenue Joffre and Rue Lupan. In the first week, all books, regardless of new or old and value, were sold at 20% of the original price. Later, as more people knew about it, business suddenly flourished, and the selling price also increased to 25% to 30% of the original price. And sometimes, regardless of the marked price of the book, the value was based on the thickness of the book. For example, literary books were originally priced at nine jiao per book regardless of thickness, but on the bookstalls, they were initially sold at two jiao per book, then increased to two and a half jiao, and finally some were sold for three jiao. And those that were thicker, such as Bing Xin's *An Autobiography of a Female Soldier*, Zhang Tianyi's full-length novel *Year*, etc., were often priced even higher.

Some small bookstores also discovered these "backdoor goods", but the selling price was 50% off, and friends who wanted cheap goods would definitely not be fooled.

Of all the books, the Literary Series and the *Anthology of New Chinese Literature* sold the best. And the two essay collections in the *Anthology of New Chinese Literature* were even more popular with readers. Priced at three jiao per book, they were quickly snapped up. The next best sellers were the three novel collections in the *Anthology of New Literature*, which also sold quite well. The collections of construction theory, literary debate, historical materials and indexes, poetry, and drama had fewer customers. It can be seen that the literary tastes and appetites of the masses are the same.

Now the bookstalls have gradually decreased, and most of the Liangyou books have been placed on the desks of every reader. Once, I chatted with a clerk at a bookstall and asked him how these books were stolen. He said that they were disguised as vendors, carrying baskets filled with fruit or peanuts on top, and books inside, and they were gradually stolen in this way. At first, the people who stole the books did not know the value of these books and sold them by the pound as old goods. Later, they learned that these books were very marketable, so they sold them by the book or at 10% of the marked price. I think one or two people and thieves would never have moved out so many books. There may be other reasons behind this, but in short, this is a risky business.

The limelight of the Liangyou literary books on the bookstalls has passed, and many socialist "banned books" published by the Taitong Bookstore have now filled the streets. The paper of these books is old and tattered, but the selling price is not cheap. For example, *Historical Materialism* and *Marx's Biography* by Bukharin, translated by Tao Bo (i.e., Peng Shuzhi, who has been executed), were originally priced at three yuan each, but now they still have to be sold at 60% or 50% off. This is also the trend of the times. These books also clearly have very good sales. (To be continued)

### Dancers' National Salvation Association Members Sell Flowers This Morning

Comfort and Relief

The Shanghai Dancers' National Salvation Association, in view of the lack of comfort for the wounded soldiers and the cold and hunger of the winter refugees, began to mobilize all its members this morning to present the city flower of Shanghai, a drooping pink ribbon, to the ladies of the society. The minimum price is one jiao, and the association's receipt is prepared. The members who are mobilized all wear a white long ribbon on their chests, with the big blue characters "Presenting you with the glorious city flower". Each team has two people, one holding a pointed paper card with bright city flowers inserted in it, and the other holding a pre-sealed money box with the association's seal on it, and the words "Selling flowers for wounded soldiers and refugees, please gentlemen and ladies give more money". The meaning is profound. It is thought that there are many benevolent people in this city who are willing to do good. It is expected that the results will be considerable.

### Central Trust Savings Bank Changing and Consolidating Council List

Savings Depositors Will Draw Lots Soon, and There Is Another Chance to Win

The Central Savings Association, upon order, received and consolidated the special prize-winning savings of the China Industrial Bank. It has been handling the exchange of lists since last month.

The procedures are very simple. Once the list is exchanged, it can share all the generous benefits stipulated in the association's charter with the original savings depositors of the association and be included in the lottery on a regular basis.

It is heard that many of the special prize-winning savings depositors of the China Industrial Bank who exchanged consolidated council lists with the association before the 19th lottery on October 15th won the lottery in that period. Savings depositors who have not exchanged lists, in view of the fact that exchanging lists one period earlier means one more chance to win the lottery, have been flocking to the association at No. 2 Tianjin Road to exchange lists in recent days.

### Our Qibao Line Retracts, Enemy Launches General Offensive on Nanshi, Forcible Crossing at Rihui Port

Enemy Troops Forcibly Occupy Rihui Port, the British Merchant Kailin Wharf; Enemy Dinghies on Huangpu River Stealthily Attack Nanshi, Repelled by Us; Pudong, Where Our Troops Put Up the Fiercest Resistance, Now Occupied by the Enemy This Morning

The Guangfu-Nanxiang Line Remains Steadfast and Unmoved

Military Update: Our troops along the Jinghu Railway are currently holding the line from Nanxiang to Huangdu. The enemy dares not advance, so there has been no intense fighting on this line. Our troops in Jiangqiao Town have retreated slightly westward. After the retreat from the defense line west of Shanghai, they moved to the line from Sijing to Songjiang. Before dawn this morning, a portion of the enemy troops advanced on Sijing from various routes from Qibao Town, where fierce fighting took place. Our troops have established close contact from Sijing to Songjiang. As of this afternoon, Songjiang remains firmly in our hands. As for the enemy troops at Tuanlai Temple, Jinshan, Quangong Pavilion, etc., although they have advanced towards Pinghu and Zhapu on both the north and west routes, attempting to seize these two key points to relieve the siege of Shihudang, our troops had already mobilized heavy forces to intercept them strictly. The enemy's conspiracy will definitely not succeed. According to official news, Pinghu and Zhapu were still secured by our troops as of this morning. In Nanshi, our troops are firmly defending the east bank of Rihui Port to South Huangpu. The enemy began artillery shelling from just after 6:00 AM, and at the same time dispatched large numbers of aircraft, in groups of three to five, to bomb in rotation. Our loyal and brave soldiers responded calmly and were not moved. At around 11:00 AM, the enemy artillery fire suddenly increased, firing densely. The sound of the shelling was like that of machine guns. At the same time, enemy bombing also became more intense. A portion of our fortifications was destroyed. At 11:30 AM, the enemy crossed the Rihui Bridge and a portion of the enemy troops managed to cross over. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting in the area south of Dapu Bridge. During the intense artillery fire, stray bullets landed in the French Concession along the border and in the refugee areas. As for Yongdong, our troops had already withdrawn. However, the enemy did not dare to land a force until this morning. Now, enemy flags are hung in various places along the Huangpu River. Pudong, the position we defended most strongly and where our troops put up the fiercest resistance, has finally fallen.

### Enemy Forces Fiercely Attack Nanshi, Forcibly Crossing Rihui Port This Afternoon

Enemy Aircraft and Artillery Fiercely Bomb, Our Troops Respond Calmly; A Small Unit of Enemy Troops Forcibly Cross the Bridge, Intercepted and Attacked by Us; Enemy Forcibly Occupies the British Merchant Hongping Wharf, Surrounded by Us

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The enemy and our forces are still facing each other across the water on both the east and west banks of Rihui Port and along the Huangpu River. At around 4:00 PM yesterday, enemy troops south of Fenglin Bridge began shelling Nanshi with field artillery. At the same time, enemy aircraft also appeared over the Huangpu River, continuously dropping large bombs and also pointing out targets for the enemy artillery. However, because the enemy's artillery fire was sparse, our defending troops did not pay attention. Seeing that our troops were calm and unmoved, the enemy, in the twilight, surrounded the west bank and attempted a stealthy crossing. At that time, our troops immediately swept the area with machine guns. The enemy, knowing they were prepared for, quickly fled back. Thus, intense firing erupted on both the east and west banks for a time. About an hour later, the firing gradually became sparser and eventually quieted down. After nightfall, neither side took action. However, the enemy occasionally fired one or two shots after long intervals, causing no damage to us. Just after 4:00 AM this morning, enemy troops attempted to move again, and the sound of gunfire resumed and gradually intensified. Enemy aircraft also took off at this time and dropped bombs back and forth. Our troops immediately returned fire and launched a counterattack. Rihui Port was immediately thrown into a state of tension.

### The Situation on Xujiahui Road is Tense

From 6:00 AM This Morning, the Sound of Artillery Fire Continues Intermittently, Mixed with Sparse Rifle Fire; Around 9:00 AM, Reporters from This Newspaper Drove to Inspect the Area Where the Western District of the French Concession Borders the Chinese Territory; Rulin Road and Gaoen Road are Close to the Enemy's Rear; the Sound of Artillery Fire is Deafening; Four or Five Enemy Heavy Bombers Flew Over the French Concession; Some French Troops Nearby Fired Several Anti-Aircraft Rounds as a Warning; The Enemy Aircraft Flew to Our Military Position in the Eastern District of Rihui Port and Dropped Multiple Large Bombs; The Explosion Sound Was Very Loud; Fire Erupted Immediately at the Point of Impact; Black Smoke Billowed Straight Up, Clearly Visible on Fuli Street; Xujiahui Road Has Been Closed to Traffic Due to the Emergency Fire Zone; The Horizontal Roads Connected to Xujiahui Road, Such as Qiqi Road, Which Leads to Fenglin Bridge, and Jin Shenfu Road, Which Leads to Dapu Bridge, Have Been Blocked About 200 Meters from Xujiahui Road; The Southern End of Dapu Bridge is the Crossroads of Intense Fighting Between the Two Armies; The Chinese Territory in the South is Rihui Port; The Artillery Fire is Extremely Fierce; Black Smoke Fills the Air; Nearby Houses are Shaken; Residents Near the Southern End of Jin Shenfu Road, Which is Close to Dapu Bridge, are Fleeing in Panic; Stray Bullets are Numerous in the Xujiahui Road Area

### Aircraft and Artillery Bomb Nanshi

The enemy is now deploying heavy artillery behind Zhaofeng Garden and in the Xuhui area, shelling southward. The enemy has densely deployed field artillery in Xujiahui, Longhua, and nearby Fenglin Bridge, concentrating firepower on our military position from three sides. At the same time, enemy aircraft are constantly flying back and forth, conducting reconnaissance and bombing in the air. Our troops are relying on the east bank of Rihui Port, holding firmly, and returning artillery fire to attack the enemy. From morning to noon, the artillery battle was fierce, and the sound of artillery fire was especially dense between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM, mixed with the sound of machine guns and rifles. A small portion of our fortifications along Rihui Port was slightly damaged, but was immediately repaired. The soldiers were unharmed. The enemy is focusing on bombing with aircraft and artillery, and the infantry is not moving out, so there is no change in the position.

### Enemy Forces Forcibly Cross Rihui Port

But at about 11:30 AM, under the cover of their aircraft and artillery, the enemy on the west bank of Rihui Port began to attack us, firing densely along the coast with machine guns. Our troops on the east bank immediately went out to meet the enemy, using small cannons, machine guns, and rifles to fire across the river. More than thirty enemy soldiers fell dead after being shot. Our side suffered no casualties. But the enemy continued to reinforce, making great sacrifices, and forcibly crossed the river towards Rihui Port. Our troops concentrated firepower and bombarded them fiercely. Countless enemy soldiers were killed. Eventually, due to the strong momentum, a small portion of the enemy troops were able to cross over. Our troops are still intercepting them tightly in nearby trenches and houses.

### Enemy Troops on Huangpu River Attempt to Cross in Stealth, Fail

Two enemy shallow-water gunboats, crossing the defense zone of foreign warships from Britain and France, arrived at the 16th Wharf in Nanshi and anchored outside our blockade line, tail east and head west, fiercely bombarding our Nanshi with artillery. After 10:00 AM today, the enemy attempted to cross our blockade line, attempting to land at the 16th Wharf. They dispatched a small yellow-smokestack steamer, fully loaded with more than a hundred Japanese soldiers carrying machine guns, etc. The boat stopped by our blockade line. The enemy soldiers in the boat, carrying weapons, climbed over the sunken ships that we had sunk to block the river. Under the cover of the enemy warships, they attempted to land. Our troops at that location were very strong. When the enemy soldiers landed, they opened fire and swept the area. Enemy soldiers fell dead one after another, and eventually failed to succeed.

### Our Troops Attack Enemy at Kailin Wharf

Central News Agency reports that the Kailin Coal Mine Wharf, operated by a British merchant west of Rihui Port in Nanshi, was not equipped with defensive fortifications by us. The enemy ignored international integrity and forcibly occupied the wharf with more than eighty enemy soldiers at 1:00 AM this morning. For self-defense, we launched an attack and wounded more than ten enemy soldiers. The remaining enemy soldiers fled into the wharf building. Four or five of our soldiers were injured.

### The Defense Line North of Guangfu Remains Unmoved

Two Offensives Were Repelled by Our Troops

Central News Agency, Correspondent Attached to the Army Reported on the Morning of the 10th (Delayed): Our defense line north of Guangfu is unaffected by the changes in the defense line south of the Suzhou River. Starting yesterday, the enemy began a fierce attack on our entire line, firing more than a thousand artillery shells, as densely as machine guns. At the same time, several hundred enemy soldiers advanced towards our line at Wangjiazhai and Zhangjiacun southwest of Luodian. After our troops fought bravely, they finally defeated them. This morning, the enemy near Guangfu again carried out harassing fire on our position. Our troops calmly returned fire, and every bullet hit its mark. The enemy suffered heavy casualties.

### The Enemy Lands in Pudong This Morning

After Gathering at Lanningdu, They Flank Nanshi Across the River

The Pudong position was occupied by enemy troops who landed this morning at 7:00 AM. In this eastern front battlefield of the three-month war of resistance, which has been subjected to indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft and warships, our loyal and brave soldiers have not only shown no fear, but have also repeatedly demonstrated their power, dealing severe blows in dozens of battles, large and small. Until the enemy changed their plan and landed stealthily at Jinshanwei, the regular troops in Pudong began the strategic abandonment of the positions they occupied along the river on the evening of the 6th of this month, only sending 500 members of a certain unit from a certain place to assist the police and members of the defense corps to defend tenaciously. Therefore, for four consecutive days, enemy aircraft continued to conduct reconnaissance and bombing, and enemy warships also frequently fired artillery to prevent our side from attacking. It wasn't until about 9:00 PM last night that a small motorboat carrying more than a dozen soldiers was dispatched by an enemy warship docked on the Pudong side of the 16th Wharf to explore the Dongchang Road Wharf. At that time, the members of our unit had already received orders to retreat. Seeing no movement, the enemy soldiers crawled ashore, searched and advanced. Seeing that there were no soldiers on any road, they returned to the warship to report. This morning, at dawn, enemy soldiers landed in several directions, including the Qichang Pier, Taitong Pier, Cemetery Pier, Chunjiang Pier, Youlong Pier, and Dongchang Pier. By 7:00 AM, they had rushed to the south of Bailianjing Port. At this point, Pudong was completely lost to the enemy. When the enemy soldiers landed, the first step was to kill anyone who looked suspicious with a pistol. In front of the Xiaoyangjing Temple of the Police Bureau Road, corpses were lying everywhere, forming a temporary execution ground, with blood flowing all over the ground. And if those people's shooting skills were poor, several people were not hit in vital areas, and rolled around in the blood. Many innocent civilians were tied to utility poles and were about to be killed by the enemy. A member of the defense corps was captured by an enemy soldier. When the enemy soldier was about to capture a second person, the member of the defense corps took out a pistol from his bag and shot the enemy soldier to death and escaped. It can be said that he was lucky to have escaped from the tiger's mouth. Yangjing Town Street, which the enemy soldiers regarded as an ominous place, has been set on fire and completely destroyed. The Qichang Pier and Lujiazhai riverfront market houses were burned down to eliminate obstacles to the enemy warships' line of sight. Most of the traitors were active everywhere. If there was half a complaint, they would be shot and killed. After 9:00 AM, enemy soldiers guarded the Dongchang Pier, only allowing people returning from Puxi, not allowing people to cross the river. They forced men to become coolies, sending them to Lujia Ferry, Yangjia Ferry, Laobai Ferry, Zhangjiabang, Tangqiao, South Pier, Zhoujia Ferry, and the south bank of Huangpu to pile sandbags and carry guns, artillery, and ammunition. A large team of enemy soldiers had been sent to those ferries to attack Nanshi from both sides.

Laiyidu, Xinmalu, Lujiazui and other places in Pudong were stealthily landed by the enemy last night. The Japanese flag is now hoisted there. Local refugees are often shot by the enemy, and the elderly are the most severely affected. Also, an enemy gunboat that entered the Jin Liyuan Wharf in Nanshi yesterday afternoon retreated this morning at about 7:00 AM, and then fired artillery shells at Nanshi, totaling more than a dozen rounds. It then sailed back to its original location and docked, and then broke into our 16th Wharf blockade line, which was immediately repelled by our troops firing machine guns at the enemy boat. After the enemy troops invaded Pudong, they first set fire to the Jiangmao Pier, and the fire blazed into the sky. A part of the enemy forces went to Laiyi Ferry, and part to Dongchang Road. The enemy troops stopped the refugees fleeing from Pudong, only allowing vacant troops to cross the river. Most of the enemy troops who went to Pudong were puppet troops from the Eastern Provinces. At about 11:00 AM, the enemy troops hung a balloon in front of the consulate at the Baitou Bridge.

### Enemy Aircraft Bomb Wuxi and Changzhou

[Zhenjiang] At 9:30 AM on the 10th, six enemy heavy bombers and two reconnaissance planes flew to Wuxi in succession to bomb the factory area, dropping a total of more than 60 bombs. The Xinhong, Yuguang, Qinking, and Qinfeng factories were heavily bombed, and the damage is still being investigated. Enemy aircraft also flew to Qiyeyan in Changzhou, dropped several bombs, and then turned back, dropping many bombs over Jiangyin and Changshu before fleeing. Also, at 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM, more than ten enemy aircraft flew to the railway stations in Wuxi and Changzhou to drop bombs, and the damage is unknown. (Central News Agency, 10th)

[Jinan] Enemy aircraft again flew into Shandong Province on the 10th, wreaking havoc along the Jinpu Railway. Yucheng, Nanshahe, Qufu, Zou County, and other places were bombed. (Central News Agency, 10th)

[Changzhou] At 8:00 AM on the 10th, two enemy aircraft attacked Changzhou, dropping two large bombs at the station, one on Shilu Road and one on the coal pile. At the same time, five enemy aircraft dropped five bombs west of Henglin Station, four in the fields and one next to the railway tracks. A train bound for Beijing happened to be there, and the train head was hit by the bomb, causing minor injuries and 13 deaths and injuries. The ironworks room of the Qiyeyan Machinery Factory was also hit by a bomb. Also, at 2:00 PM, six enemy aircraft dropped seven large bombs at the station, two bombs hit the Longtou room, damaging several locomotives, and the rest fell in the fields. They then flew to Qiyeyan Station and dropped two bombs, damaging a section of the platform and destroying three houses. They also dropped three bombs over Henglin, with no major damage.

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Reiterates Determination to Resist to the End

The Nine-Power Treaty Conference Will Not Close Without Results, Representatives of Britain, the United States, and France Have Completely Consistent Views

Brussels: The Chinese delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference issued an official report last night, stating that it had received a declaration from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, explaining that the withdrawal of Chinese troops from the vicinity of the Public Concession in Shanghai was entirely due to tactical needs, the purpose of which was to prolong long-term resistance. Chiang Kai-shek continued that the Chinese government and the people of the whole country are determined to resist to the end. As long as the enemy is on Chinese territory, China will do its best to defend it. As long as Chinese sovereignty is threatened, there will be no peace between China and Japan. Under these circumstances, China is not only spiritually but also factually upholding the Nine-Power Treaty, and hopes that other signatory countries can do the same. The declaration concluded by stating that the determination of the entire Chinese nation to resist will enable the Nanjing government to hope that the situation in the Far East can be fairly and justly resolved. (National Telecommunications, 11th)

Brussels: According to informed sources, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will not close until concrete results are obtained. In this regard, the general public attaches great importance to the consultations held by British Foreign Secretary Eden, French Foreign Minister Talberg-Bos, and US Chief Representative Davis at the Capital Hotel at 6:00 PM today. In the evening, Eden hosted a banquet for representatives of the British Commonwealth according to custom, and invited Davis to participate. Many believe that this move indicates that the opinions of Britain and the United States are clearly converging. (National Telecommunications, 10th)

Brussels: Japanese sources here stated that the reports in the newspapers that Japan would abolish the Nine-Power Treaty of 1922 are not true. The Japanese government has no such intention and has decided to uphold the principle of the Open Door under any circumstances. (National Telecommunications, 11th)

[Tokyo] The Belgian Ambassador to Japan went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today to ask when the Japanese government's reply to the application from the Nine-Power Treaty Conference could be expected. Vice Foreign Minister Horita replied that the Japanese government is currently drafting this reply, which can be submitted to the Cabinet for approval this Friday, and then immediately sent to the Belgian Ambassador for transmission to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. (National Telecommunications, 10th)

### British, American, and French Representatives Discuss the Safety of the Concessions

Japan Refuses to Participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Leaving No Doubt

Brussels: The chief representatives of Britain, the United States, and France at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Eden, Davis, and Talberg-Bos, held important talks last night to discuss the status of the Shanghai concessions and the protective measures that should be taken. It is heard that the three politicians all believed that there was little certainty regarding Tokyo's response to the application sent to the Nine-Power Conference a few days ago. Therefore, they will agree on recommendations so that they can be submitted as soon as Tokyo's reply is received, without wasting time. There is now little doubt that the Japanese government will frankly reject the application. The only decision that remains is whether the door to continued negotiations will still be open. The Japanese side said that it would not stop military action without complete victory, but China is also determined to continue the war and will not show weakness. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 11th)

[London] British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranbourne stated in the House of Commons today that after British Ambassador Hugh Knatchbull-Hugessen was attacked by a Japanese aircraft on the Beijing-Shanghai Road, although British officials had notified the Japanese authorities whenever possible when entering dangerous areas, the illegal damage caused by Japanese troops in China could not escape their responsibility even without such notification. Cranbourne also stated that there is no regulation requiring the Japanese military authorities to be notified of British people's travels by car in China. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 10th)

### A Large Group of Students in Brussels Demonstrates at the Japanese Embassy

Thousands of People Sign a Letter to the Japanese Ambassador, Protesting the Destruction of Our Cultural Institutions

Brussels: A large group of students demonstrated outside the Japanese Embassy here today, and many were arrested by the police, including the president of the Student Union and other officials. The students in Brussels originally planned to organize a parade to submit a protest signed by a thousand students to the Japanese Ambassador, opposing the systematic destruction of educational and cultural institutions by the Japanese army in China. The students then gathered at the police station to hold a demonstration, forcing the police to request military police to suppress them before dispersing the students. It is also heard that the Japanese Embassy issued a declaration regarding the students' protest, stating, "Japan has done its best in humanitarian and cultural work in China," and that the students' claims were "base and ridiculous," and that the Belgian students should be concerned with resolving the current disputes in Europe. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 10th)

### There Are No Enemy Traces in Guanhaiwei

Since the news of the enemy's landing at Guanhaiwei on the south bank of the Qiantang River spread, the Ningbo and Shaoxing natives in this port were immediately terrified. According to the telegram from the Sanbei Steamboat Company, the reported news is definitely untrue. Also, the passengers who arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo this morning, who passed through Cao'e to Ningbo yesterday, also said that it was not true. Central News Agency reported that there was also news that the enemy had landed at Guanhaiwei on the south bank of the Qiantang River the day before, and that a part of the enemy was advancing on Yuyao, but this has not been confirmed as there was no report from the military authorities.

### [Random Comments]

Nine-Power Treaty Conference. I had long expected that it would have no effect. However, those who superstitiously believe in the "sacred theory of conferences" still thought that it would at least be of some use. And now, what is the result? Before the meeting opened, it welcomed the participation of the Soviet Union. Now that the Soviet Union has participated, they are afraid that it will not leave, so it is excluded from the mediation committee. It is right for Litvinov to leave in a huff. Observing what Litvinov came for, and what Litvinov left for, the drawbacks of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference have already been fully exposed. What else is there to hope for?

### Foreign Eyewitnesses Talk About the Situation of Our Troops Withdrawing from Xuhui

Four Thousand People Marched in Formation and Slowly Advanced Westward to Hongqiao, Presenting British Soldiers with Four Bottles of Wine and Shaking Hands as a Farewell

The North China Daily News reported that, according to foreign eyewitnesses, there was no chaos or disorder in the withdrawal of the Chinese troops from Xuhui. They organized and abandoned the defensive positions along the Suzhou River and west of the railway. This move showed the orders of the commander. It was on Tuesday night that the artillery roared and the bombs fell near the Hua Jun position near Jessfield Road. About four thousand people marched in formation and slowly advanced westward to Hongqiao, with few wounded soldiers among them. Since they moved to Xuhui to fight, they had been neighbors with the British soldiers. Now, moving to a new position, they still did not forget to sadly say goodbye to the British soldiers. A Chinese captain who had befriended a British officer sought him out and shook hands to say goodbye. Then, from under his coat, he took out four bottles of wine and presented them to the British officer, saying, "Please share them with your troops as a memorial to our friendship." The officers monitoring the withdrawal of the troops followed the ranks until all the soldiers had left to the west before following the ranks.

### Ten Thousand Yuan Loss for Shangsong

According to Yin Shisheng, the manager of the Shangsong Motor Company, who came to Shanghai from Songjiang, after the enemy landed at Quan Gong Ting and other places in Jinshanwei, Songjiang became an important transportation hub between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the situation suddenly became tense. The enemy was exerting all its strength to attack the area, attempting to capture Songjiang in one fell swoop and threaten our Shanghai garrison. The enemy planes were especially cruel and violent. Currently, the Songjiang County and Public Security Bureau and other agencies have been bombed and destroyed. Part of the Commissioner's Office has also been destroyed. The number of civilian houses that have been destroyed is even more difficult to count. The company properties of the Shangsong Highway's head office at Maluqiao, and the Zhuangqiao Sheshan branch, were also bombed and destroyed by enemy aircraft one after another. Regarding company staff, ticket inspector Liu Bincheng and mechanic Zhang Shihe were injured in the bombing. Since August 13th, only three or four of the company's military vehicles and passenger cars have been traveling between Shangsong. Since the enemy invaded Songjiang, all operations have been completely suspended. The company's total loss is estimated to be more than 100,000 yuan. When I (Manager Yin speaking of himself) left Songjiang the night before last, enemy traces had been discovered in the eastern and southern gate areas. However, our army had elite troops stationed there, and their morale was unusually high, and they were engaged in active counterattacks. Currently, there are very few civilians residing in Songjiang city. Apart from some who have come to Shanghai, the majority are helping the elderly and children and fleeing to the neighboring villages to the west.

### Partial Martial Law on Xujiahui Road

Maintaining Order, Prohibition of Passage

After the Shanghai battle shifted to a new defensive position, the situation south of Shanghai became critical. The French Concession authorities, considering that the southern part of Xujiahui Road borders the Huajie Xietu Road, have constructed a wall from Xieqiao in the east, westward to Beile Road. Further west, it extends directly to Xujiahui, separated by a creek. Now, because the war has shifted to the western and southern parts of Shanghai, there are fears that the peace and order within the concession will be affected. Therefore, starting yesterday morning, martial law has been declared in the Xujiahui Road area, prohibiting the passage of vehicles and people. French, Russian, and Vietnamese police officers have been dispatched to patrol the area.

### Bombing Situation in Shanghai County

Warehouses Completely Destroyed, Refugees Eagerly Awaiting Relief

In recent days, various villages and towns under the jurisdiction of Shangsong County have been repeatedly bombed by enemy aircraft, and many civilians have been killed or injured by machine-gun fire. The exact number is difficult to count. On the 6th and 8th, the area along the Shangsong Motor Road was bombed all day long. At 4:00 PM on the 8th, two enemy planes bombed the area between Beiqiao and Maqiao on the Shangsong Road, dropping seven or eight bombs in total. Two bombs landed on Maqiao, and four bombs landed on Yantang. Part of the Jiangsu Provincial Yantang People's Education Center Cooperative Hall was destroyed, and the cooperative's warehouse was completely destroyed. More than 4,500 bales of cotton and other goods stored inside were completely lost, totaling about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. At that time, the Yantang People's Education Center was in the process of relocating women and children, and was also subjected to enemy machine-gun fire, resulting in the death of one child. It has been investigated that the county is located east of Songjiang, north of Fengxian, and south of Qibao. Regular transportation has long been cut off. Because the matter occurred so suddenly, many local people remained in their homes, and are eagerly awaiting relief. According to people who walked to Shanghai on the 9th, several bridges on the Hu-Min Road have been bombed and destroyed. Along the way, there are many bombed-out cars and dead and injured civilians, which is a very tragic sight.

### Foreign Nationals and Officials Celebrate Peace Memorial

The consulates and military personnel of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, Germany, and other countries stationed in Shanghai held a celebration and wreath-laying ceremony in front of the Goddess of Peace on the Bund in the French Concession at 9:00 AM. Warships of various countries stationed in the Huangpu River in Shanghai and the consulates and public institutions of various countries stationed in Shanghai all flew flags in celebration. Various foreign charitable organizations also sent young women to sell red paper flowers on the streets to commemorate the occasion and to use the proceeds from the donations to comfort disabled veterans and support charitable causes.

### Vegetable Management Committee Regulates Shanghai's Vegetable Supply

Supply Decreases, Prices Soar by Half; Efforts are Underway to Stabilize Prices and Prevent Shortages

The Shanghai Local Produce Trade Association, in order to meet the needs of wartime society, regulate civilian food supplies, and protect the interests of farmers in the rear, has established a Transportation and Management Committee for Vegetables and Local Produce to handle the transportation of inland vegetables and local produce to Shanghai. Since the Suzhou Creek area west of Shanghai fell into the war zone, the committee has sought to change the route to Shanghai. Now, because Nanshi and other places have successively become war zones, vegetables from the inland areas cannot be transported to Shanghai. Vegetable vendors in various small markets have reduced their supply, and prices have soared, increasing by 50% compared to normal times. The committee is currently trying to ensure that Shanghai's food supply is not affected by shortages.

### Various Charitable Organizations Rescue Refugees from Danger

Since our army retreated to the new defensive positions, the residents of the western districts of Shanghai and the Xujiahui Shishanwan area have lost their support and have moved to safer areas. Except for a portion of young and strong people who have escaped to the border between the Chinese and foreign concessions, where they have been distributed to refugee camps by various charitable organizations, there are still a large number of women and children gathered there awaiting rescue. Upon hearing the news, charitable organizations immediately dispatched a large number of trucks and ambulances to risk going to rescue them. As of noon today, more than 4,000 refugees have been rescued. The rescue efforts will continue this afternoon, but there is a shortage of vehicles, and the number of refugees is large. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will lend or donate vehicles.

### Italian Military Commander Donates Bread to Relieve Refugees

### Suspect Arrested in Bathtub Corpse Case

Huang Kejia's Handwriting Quite Similar to the Deceased's Note

Shen Yuzhen, the wife of Huang Weiyuan, the owner of the American Raisin Company, located at No. 13, Lane 296, Gongguan Road, French Concession, was murdered on the 3rd of this month in Room 201 of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road. Details have been reported in this newspaper. After investigation by Chief Detective Zhang Yuanqing of the Laozha Police Station, who is handling the case, it was discovered that a note left by the deceased in the room appeared to be in the handwriting of Huang Kejia (31 years old), a Jia Ding native who was a former runner for the American Company. It was also learned that he lived at No. 137, Willmont Road, so he was summoned to the police station. After comparing the handwriting, there were many similarities, so he was detained and sent to the First Special Court this morning. The police station lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated that the case still required detailed investigation, so he requested that Huang Kejia be temporarily detained. After interrogation by Judge Feng Shide, it was approved to detain him for further questioning at a later date.

### Cultivate Our Powerful Anti-Japanese War Team

— Zhang Mingshi

It was probably about a week ago? I received a letter from Mr. Guo Woli, in which he gave us many insightful opinions. In addition to sincerely admiring and accepting them, there are two points that I must mention: ㊀ To give a brief report on the environment in which we are located. ㊁ To make an external request within the scope of possibility to realize our ideals. But I am ashamed to say that, in recent days, the editor has been immersed in the busy atmosphere of organizing manuscripts for the "Shanghai Boy Scouts" monthly magazine and "Wartime Scouts" manuscripts, coupled with being driven by the work of personal life issues. Therefore, it has been delayed again and again until today. Now it cannot be delayed any longer, so I am taking some time out of this busyness to fulfill this long-held wish.

Mr. Guo raised the issue of the length of this column. His meaning is, "I am willing to contribute my meager efforts to support this field of wartime youth, but I hope that the length can be expanded even more!" Regarding this point, I must give a brief report to Mr. Guo and other "wartime youth" lovers who have the same intention as Mr. Guo.

When we started contacting various parties about the "wartime youth publication issue," we almost received the same answer, which was: "During this period of resistance against Japan, the source of newspapers is not smooth, and it is almost entirely supported by inventory. Therefore, we have to reduce the length to seek sustainability. Under this current situation, when news is crowded, advertisements are often removed. It can be seen that the position is so constrained that it has reached its limit. Although assisting anti-Japanese war propaganda is the due duty of the newspaper, we are more than willing but lack the ability, and we can only sigh helplessly!" After hearing these remarks, although we have the heart to serve the country, we cannot force others to do what they cannot do, especially since this kind of answer is really someone else's frustration, so it is certainly not good to discuss it again.

Finally, after many efforts, we were fortunate enough to be granted a daily allocation of one to two thousand words by the Shenbao Museum for the publication of this column. However, when manuscripts are crowded, it still has to be reduced accordingly. After several discussions, it was decided to start publishing from October 1st. But then things changed again, that is, the Shenbao side felt that the length was insufficient, and in fact could not be published every day. If it must be published every day, then it would be easier to change it to the evening newspaper. Therefore, from the 2nd, it was changed to be published in the Shenbao Evening Newspaper.

Of course, we also want to expand the length so that we can enrich the content and strengthen the power of publicity, which would be of great help to the future of the anti-Japanese war. But judging from the process of contacting the publication, it may be a very difficult problem? But of course, we still have to discuss with the newspaper to give us some help in order to satisfy the hopes of us and the lovers. I think unless there is really no way, the newspaper will definitely be willing to support it!

Mr. Guo also raised the issue of the content of this column. His meaning is; "Try to collect as much material as possible that young people need, so as to cultivate our powerful anti-Japanese war vanguard." This must be discussed from two aspects. The first is the "need problem." What is the need of young people? Of course, we cannot arbitrarily determine it with subjective intentions, and the actual needs of each person are not necessarily the same. Therefore, the best way is to solicit opinions from outside, asking the youth community to tell us what each person needs. After we receive these reports, we can classify and organize them, and gradually introduce those needed materials according to the urgency of the need. Otherwise, many of the materials we introduce may not be what most young people need; on the other hand, the materials that young people urgently need may not be introduced by us. Wouldn't that be too uneconomical? The second is the "talent problem." The mission of our group is indeed broad, and the work we undertake is indeed heavy, such as the tasks of guarding, carrying stretchers, first aid, nursing, comforting, and recruiting at the rear wounded soldiers' hospitals; and the tasks of guarding, maintaining order, receiving, sending, and recruiting clothes at the refugee camps. At the front, we are responsible for first aid, transportation, traffic, intelligence, documentation, and liaison. There are also the autumn order maintenance of various temporary salvation groups' meetings, etc., and our members and staff are needed to participate in these activities. Therefore, we have almost directed all our strength towards this. The talents in all aspects of publicity are of course not very strong, especially in the editorial aspect, only one or two people are responsible, but the undertakings that are managed include three periodicals, "Shanghai Boy Scouts" monthly magazine, "Wartime Scouts" and "Wartime Youth", as well as "Wartime Wall Books" irregular publications and soliciting contributions from various publishing circles. You think it is exhausting one or two people to cope with such complexity. How can one not feel the weakness of power, not to mention the occupational work that is generated to maintain personal life, and one must devote some strength to handle it. Isn't this busy on top of busy? If we take a step back, even if we don't feel busy, may I ask whether the talent of one or two people can meet the needs of the youth community? For the above urgent needs, we have to seek assistance from all walks of life.

Now, in addition to internal staff, I would like to solicit long-term voluntary special commentators from outside, who will provide some works on a regular basis. When encountering special problems, designate several people to discuss solutions. In this way, the materials needed by the youth community will not be difficult to gradually supply. What do you think of this, Mr. Guo?

Finally, I hope Mr. Guo will tell me your address so that I can visit or correspond with you. At the same time, I hope that those who agree with the above two methods will write directly to let us know, so as to facilitate the progress!
