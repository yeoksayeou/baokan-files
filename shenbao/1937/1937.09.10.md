At Luodian, We Pursued the Victory; Enemy Position Increasingly Compressed.
Our Air Force Attacked Enemy Ships at Night, Enemy Aircraft Suffered Heavy Damage.

According to midnight reports, ㊀ the enemy's second reinforcement unit has completely landed, joining the front line to fight. Days of intense attacks from all directions have been met with fierce resistance, and they have not succeeded. It is reported that the enemy has declared that they will launch a general offensive today. However, the enemy's strategy has long been detected by our army, and our army's position is solid and our forces are strong. If the enemy attacks, they will suffer heavy losses. ㊁ The intensity of the fierce battle at the Qiujiang Wharf yesterday morning was rare since the start of the Shanghai battle. Approximately one thousand enemy soldiers advanced towards our military industry road position. After being fiercely attacked head-on by our army, the enemy suffered three to four hundred casualties. Regiment Commander Iida Shichiro, Company Commander Umeda Sadao, and Squad Leader Kato were all killed on the spot by our army. Afterwards, the enemy continued to attack, and the battle continued all day. However, our military industry road line remained unshaken. ㊂ When Baoshan City fell, all the soldiers in the battalion led by our General Yao Ziqing heroically sacrificed themselves. The morale of the front-line soldiers has become even more激昂. Currently, our army is holding the line east of Yanghang, blocking the enemy's advance and waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. ㊃ In the Luodian area, after our army captured Changqiao, the enemy's position became increasingly compressed, and the enemy in the Shizilin area was also under great threat. Our army is currently advancing victoriously. ㊄ In the Yunzaobang area, the enemy and us are still facing each other on both sides of the Nansitang River. The enemy at Yunzaobang previously attempted to cross the Nansitang River to attack, and many were killed by us. Examining the symbols, it is known that the enemy there is the 6th Regiment of the Nagoya 3rd Division. ㊅ In the Zhabei area, yesterday morning was particularly quiet. From noon until evening, the enemy attacked several times, but were bravely repelled by our army, and the front line remained unchanged.

### Enemy Counterattacked Along Military Industry Road; Routed by Our Ambush, Retreating to the Riverbank

At 5:00 AM yesterday, enemy ships in the Huangpu River again frequently attacked our downtown area positions. At the same time, a small group of enemy soldiers, numbering about four to five hundred, used five tanks to advance towards our army from Guanyintang and other places on the military industry road. At 7:00 AM, the enemy's outpost arrived near Chunjiang Road, behind Lujia Guanyintang. Our defending troops of the □ brigade calmly responded, and when they approached, they rushed out of Yangjiazai and launched a fierce attack on the enemy. Under the strafing of our machine guns and the attacks of hand grenades and mortars, the stubborn enemy suffered heavy casualties, with few survivors.

According to a report from a certain military vehicle unit, at 5:00 AM yesterday, enemy ships and aircraft in the Huangpu River launched a large-scale bombing of our military industry road, Wuquan Road, and Guanyinqiao area positions. At the same time, a large group of infantry attacked the Fengjiazhai intersection. After a while, another group of enemy soldiers advanced towards Zhangjiazhai. At that time, our army at Shenjiaxingzhen immediately moved out, divided into groups, and launched a fierce attack on the left side and back of the enemy. There was no turning back. The enemy responded in a panic, and the front line immediately wavered. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, and the enemy collapsed, retreating to the riverbank. Also, in the Guanyinqiao area, our army and the enemy are still confronting each other across the Qiujiang River.

According to the Central News Agency, at about 5:00 AM yesterday, enemy ships on the Qiujiang Wharf river surface opened fire and bombarded our military industry road, Wuquan Road, and Guanyintang Road areas. Enemy aircraft also flew in formation over the sky to bomb. At the same time, the enemy at Qiujiang Wharf, under the cover of enemy aircraft and artillery fire, attacked our Fengjiazhai intersection. Our army lured the enemy deep and retreated. The enemy followed, reaching the vicinity of Zhangjiazhai. Our troops stationed in Shenjiaxing launched a surprise attack from the northeast on the left and back of the enemy. The enemy was caught in an ambush by our army and suffered heavy losses. They then retreated to the riverbank in a panic and did not dare to attack until evening. As for Guanyinqiao, the enemy and us are still confronting each other across the Qiujiang River.

The result of the fierce battle in the Yinxiangxiang area on the 8th was that, in addition to Hecunzhai, which had already been captured by our army, the enemy troops in Zhoujiazhai had been completely cleared, and only a few remnants remained in the Shenjiazhai area. It is said that on that day, our army killed a total of eight or nine hundred enemies in that area.

### Enemy Attacked Zhabei Again, But Did Not Succeed

At about 8:00 PM yesterday, fierce fighting broke out again between the enemy and us in the Baoshan Road area. The enemy launched an attack on our position from several routes, including Dongbaoxing Road and Yingui Road. When we saw the enemy approaching, we immediately used mortars and machine guns to counterattack, preventing the enemy from advancing, and confronted the enemy remotely relying on the built fortifications. At about 3:00 PM, the gunfire subsided, but the enemy frequently bombarded indiscriminately with artillery until late in the evening.

In the Qingyun Road Baziqiao area of Zhabei, fierce fighting broke out again between the enemy and our army between 6:00 PM and 7:00 PM yesterday. For a time, the sound of machine guns and artillery was as dense as a string of beads. The nearby civilian houses in that area were hit by enemy artillery fire and burned fiercely.

### Enemy Suffered Heavy Losses at Yunzaobang

The battle at Yunzaobang last night was extremely fierce. Our right-wing □ division has advanced to the vicinity of Caojiazhai in Yunzaobang, and a very fierce bloody battle has taken place in that area. Although the enemy used heavy artillery to bombard our army fiercely, our army's position was not damaged at all. The artillery battle near Wangjiazhuang was also very fierce.

Enemy ships at Songkou bombarded Caojiazhai, north of Yunzaobang, on the 8th, and we also used heavy artillery to bombard the enemy's position in the Wangjiazhuang area, causing heavy losses to the enemy.

### Fierce Battle at Luodian; Our Army Recaptured Changqiao and Other Places

Our army in Luodian attacked Changqiao, about two kilometers north of the town, the day before yesterday (the 8th), and fought fiercely with more than a thousand enemy soldiers in the area west of Wujiazhai, Tanshichqiao, and Xiaojintangzhai. Our army first used rifles and machine guns to shoot, then used hand grenades to attack the enemy fiercely, and finally launched a bayonet charge for close combat. In the evening, Changqiao was recaptured. At the same time, a part of our soldiers crossed the Shanghai-Taicang Road in the dark and recovered Fengjiazhai, about one kilometer north of Changqiao. As a result of this bloody battle all day, our army, with its brave charge and being attacked from three sides, had one company commander, two platoon leaders, and more than one hundred and sixty soldiers heroically sacrifice themselves. However, the enemy's corpses were also scattered all over the ground, and the number of casualties was several times that of our army.

According to refugees who escaped from the countryside of Jiading, they escaped from Gujiazhen, Luodian, along the Shanghai-Taicang Road. There were no Japanese soldiers along the way, and all the guarding soldiers were Chinese troops. Japanese soldiers have now retreated to the seaside about six li northeast of Luodian Town. However, since the war broke out there, many soldiers and civilians have been killed and injured. The fields smell bad, and there are corpses everywhere, and most of them are abandoned in the river. Therefore, the water in the river is undrinkable. The flower fields have all borne fruit, but no one is harvesting them. Abandoning wealth on the ground is really a pity.

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th Telegram, Military News, ㊀ About one brigade of the enemy at Zhanghuabang, at 8:00 AM on the morning of the 7th, divided into eight groups, each group with about one company of infantry, crossed the North Sitang River using rubber boats and other means, and attacked our position.

### Our Air Force Came to Shanghai Yesterday to Assist in the Battle

Our Air Force came to Shanghai to assist in the battle at about 5:00 PM yesterday. When passing over the Huangpu River from west to east, enemy ships fired high-射砲guns and machine guns indiscriminately. At that time, stray bullets and iron shrapnel fell in the central area of the concession, but fortunately they were not in the bustling city, so no major disasters occurred. According to a reporter's investigation, two Westerners were injured in front of the Citibank building on Fuzhou Road, and three people, including a shoemaker and a newspaper editor, were injured in front of the Zhongnan Bank on Hankou Road. The police station ambulance immediately dispatched and sent the injured to the hospital for emergency treatment.

Our Air Force came to Shanghai twice last night and this morning and engaged in fierce battles with enemy ships over the Huangpu River. The first time was at about 11:30 PM, when we suddenly heard the sound of high-射砲guns booming incessantly. We knew our planes were coming to attack, but it was quiet after about five minutes. An hour later, the sound of artillery fire rose again, like a string of beads, and signal flares and searchlights were fired at the same time, shining like lightning. Our planes also returned fire with machine guns, and the sound of格格 was heard in the clouds. The battle situation was very fierce. Our planes circled several times and then flew away safely. They did not drop any bombs. At that time, there was a rumbling sound, which was the heavy artillery fired by our army, using the signals sent by the enemy ships as targets to aim and bombard. It is said that the enemy ships were ambushed by us and suffered considerable damage.

### Enemy Mechanized Units Arrived in Shanghai

According to confirmed reports, more than twenty enemy aircraft near Shalonggang bombarded our position fiercely last night, and more than 4,000 enemy troops landed at the Huishan Wharf, most of whom were mechanized units.

The enemy has been fighting hard in Shanghai for nearly a month, but has made no progress. They have repeatedly requested assistance from the country, and it has arrived one after another. According to confirmed news, on the morning of the 8th, another four transport ships sailed into the Huangpu River and landed at the Huangpu and Osaka wharves.

Details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It was found that the factory stored a lot of enemy military supplies and was stationed by troops.

### Enemy Aircraft Tragically Bombed Songjiang Station; Road Bureau Repaired and Opened to Traffic

Opening-Beijing and Opening-Hangzhou Passenger Trains Changed to Evening Departures; One Enemy Aircraft Flew Over Ping Station Yesterday for Reconnaissance

The enemy aircraft bombed five passenger cars from Shanghai to Hangzhou at Songjiang Station the day before yesterday, causing more than 700 innocent refugees to be killed or injured. This is an unprecedented catastrophe for our transportation sector. The暴敌's wanton killing of non-combatants is not tolerated by any citizen with even a little humanity. At that time, the Songjiang Station was also severely damaged. After receiving the news, the two Road Administration Bureaus immediately dispatched engineering vehicles and ambulances, risking danger, to rush to the scene, first rescuing the injured refugees to nearby hospitals for treatment, then clearing the tracks, and rushing to repair. It was not until yesterday afternoon that the repairs were completed and traffic was opened. For the safety of passengers, the bureau changed to using two passenger cars from yesterday, because there is a danger of air raids during the day, so it was changed to running at night. It departs for Hangzhou at 6:30 PM and for Beijing at 7:00 PM every day, and passengers still board at the West Station. It is also learned that at 10:20 AM yesterday morning, a team of enemy aircraft flew over the Linping Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road for reconnaissance, but did not drop any bombs. After about two minutes, they went east. At that time, Hangzhou City had issued an air raid alert and was strictly guarded. Because the enemy aircraft had turned back, the alert was lifted.

According to passengers, it is very difficult to buy tickets at the West Station. Some people have waited for two hours and have not been able to buy a ticket and board the train. It is hoped that the Road Bureau will find a way to improve it.

### How Can the World Tolerate the Savage Acts of Enemy Aircraft?

Japan's International Status Is Becoming More and More Isolated, Stained by the Blood of Innocent Civilians

According to the English "Da Mei Ying Bao", when the aircraft bombed the South Railway Station that day, independent observers did not see a single soldier there, only hundreds of pitiful refugees, who were killed or injured among their scattered piles of luggage. We have called it murder. The Japanese aircraft bombed the refugee train from Shanghai at Songjiang the day before yesterday. It is reported that 300 people were killed and 400 people were injured. There is not a single word in English to describe this kind of action. Its barbarity is unheard of. There is no military purpose. It is伤天害理 beyond measure. The whole world must be silently shocked by it, because there is really nothing to say, only shock and pain. Will the perpetrators try to justify their actions? But the facts are clear and cannot mitigate this crime against God. There was no military train in between, and there is no reason to suspect this. In any case, those who drive military aircraft and use their tragic weapons to harm civilians cannot escape their responsibility. Since the British ambassador was injured, this lesson cannot be evaded. Even if China had declared war, it could be said. Now, the two sides have not declared war, have not declared the purpose of the war, and have not given helpless non-combatants the opportunity to avoid to areas that can be considered safe. This kind of crime is unforgivable. In short, there is no place that can be considered safe today. The fact that the two sides have not officially engaged in actual combat may be a good thing, but now they are wantonly屠殺 the innocent, causing civilians to be killed and injured. This is unprecedented in wartime. Although the total number of war deaths and injuries in the past was more than it is today, they were all soldiers, or soldiers made up the majority. I never expected that in the 1937 war in China, Chinese men, women, and children would suffer such a tragic disaster. Judging from the current situation, if the whole world can know about the tragedy caused by the bombing of refugee trains, it seems that it can promote a firm action from the outside world. This kind of behavior that violates the rules of war, this kind of evil魔降臨 that is even more inferior than the morality of the forest, cannot be tolerated on human conscience. What I am afraid of now is that people around the world will not be able to believe what happened here, at least temporarily, and will feel that this is another accidental event. But is this an accidental event? This is a manifestation of a cold determination to break China's determination to resist by relying on any unbelievable means. What can strengthen China's will to resist more than this? We are in this war and always treat both sides in a fair manner. This is our policy. We are often criticized by both sides for being too lenient towards the other. But the bombing of the South Railway Station is something that we cannot forgive, and the bombing of refugee trains seems even more brutal to us. We can't even listen to their defense, because the facts are clear and there is no room for further debate. Japan is now被全世界所唾罵, and even those who love it cannot defend it this time. Japan is now isolated and stained by the blood of innocent civilians.

### Aftermath of the Fall of Baoshan on the 7th; One Battalion of Our Army Martyred

Only Two or Three Survivors; Enemy Casualties Also Extremely Heavy

Since the 5th, the enemy has concentrated the power of its navy, army, and air force to attack Baoshan County. The one battalion of our troops stationed in the city were determined to die with the city and fought loyally. After two days of fighting, they lost contact with the outside and were cut off from reinforcements. Finally, the enemy's reinforcements continued to arrive, broke into the city. Our defending soldiers, from the battalion commander on down, were all martyred, and died with the city on the 7th. However, the intensity of our army's resistance and the tragedy of their sacrifice were the greatest scene since the start of the Shanghai battle, and also the most glorious page in the history of our nation's liberation war. According to a report from a soldier who was wounded and returned from the city, the battle went through the following: Baoshan City is located on the coast, and it is very difficult to defend. However, in order to connect its coastal positions, the enemy must do everything possible to fight for it. Since the 5th, the enemy has concentrated 30 warships, lined up at the Songkou, and bombarded fiercely with排砲. It also used more than 20 tanks to cover the infantry charge. Our defending soldiers, one battalion in total, defended the city and frequently used machine guns and手溜彈 to counterattack intensively. The enemy advanced and retreated repeatedly and suffered heavy losses. The enemy then launched a fierce attack from several routes, and the positions outside the city were lost, resulting in being surrounded. All the soldiers of our battalion pledged their lives to the country. Even in the besieged city, they still responded calmly. At that time, the city wall was broken in many places by enemy artillery fire. We filled and defended it at any time, but it was too late. Enemy soldiers took advantage of the opportunity to arrive, but our army never showed weakness, aimed and shot, and often repelled the enemy. With a small place and the strength of one battalion, they held on for two days and nights. Finally, due to the continuous increase of the enemy and the disparity in the number of enemy and us, they were rushed in by the enemy and a street battle broke out. On the 7th, our ammunition was exhausted and we were exhausted, so it fell. Our entire battalion was sacrificed, and only two or three were wounded and escaped, while the enemy's casualties were also extremely heavy. The fierceness of our soldiers' resistance in this battle was enough to terrify the enemy.

### Measures for the Placement of Peiping-Tianjin Refugee Students in the Capital

Over Three Hundred People Reside in the Second Middle School. Methods Are Established for Middle School Students to Enter Schools.

[Nanjing] The over three hundred Peiping-Tianjin refugee students who have come to the capital are concentrated in the Second Middle School, where they receive two meals a day, temporarily provided by the Ministry of Education. All other expenses must be borne by themselves. When the students left Peiping-Tianjin, the weather was still hot, and they did not bring any luggage. Now that autumn is approaching, they have no clothes to keep warm or blankets to cover themselves. They gather in the dormitory during the day and sleep on cots at night, living in misery. Various circles in the capital have examined the refunded Boxer Indemnity funds, which were originally designated for educational purposes. The Peiping-Tianjin students are now refugees due to the national crisis, and it is hoped that the educational authorities will provide some relief. The Ministry of Education has set three preliminary methods for arranging high school and middle school students from Peiping-Tianjin who are staying in the capital: (1) High school graduates from Peiping-Tianjin who are staying in the capital can apply to the temporary universities in Changsha and Xi'an or other universities and specialized schools that can accommodate new students. Middle school graduates can apply directly to various high schools. (2) After being admitted, they must have original school documents or other equivalent proof of documents in order to be admitted to school. (3) High school and middle school students who have not graduated can, according to their grade level, be issued a letter of introduction by the Ministry and apply to equivalent schools in various places, where they will be tested and placed in the appropriate grade level for temporary study.

### Red Cross Sends a Team to Songjiang for Rescue

The enemy aircraft bombed the train filled with refugees at Songjiang Station the day before yesterday (the 8th). The number of people in distress reached seven or eight hundred. The simplicity of the rescue equipment there made it very difficult for the authorities to deal with the victims. The injured cried out along the way, and the dead were exposed in the streets. Wang, the administrative inspector of Songjiang, and Magistrate Cao specially telegraphed Du Yuesheng and Tao Baichuan, two members of the Anti-Japanese Support Association in the city, requesting emergency assistance. Du and Tao immediately asked the Red Cross Society yesterday morning to send a large rescue team, carrying a large number of medical supplies, gauze, and other rescue items, to Songjiang to assist the Songjiang authorities in rescuing the injured refugees.

### European and American Mail Arrives in Shanghai for the First Time After the Shanghai War

Shanghai-Shantou-Xiamen Telegrams are Blocked

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, mail from European and American countries and the South China region to Shanghai has been greatly delayed. However, the postal authorities are working hard to find ways to dredge the situation so that the mail sent to Shanghai from various places will not be delayed for too long. It is reported that the Siberian mail that was stranded in Dalian has already been transferred to Japan. Mail from various ports in South China, carried by the President Hoover and the Canadian ship, has also been retained in Japan. The post office has taken steps to hand it over to the Nagasaki Maru of the Japanese Mail Ship Company a few days ago to transport a batch to Shanghai. The ship arrived at the port at about 3:00 PM yesterday and docked at the Yangshupu Wharf. Since the military eastern area prohibits people from coming and going, the post office consulted with the authorities of the Public Concession to find a way to transport it out. There is still mail stranded in Japan, which will continue to be transported to Shanghai.

According to sources from the city's transportation agencies, the submarine cablegrams from Shanghai to Shantou and Xiamen have been destroyed since the enemy illegally blockaded the sea, so it is impossible to report. Currently, ordinary and urgent telegrams sent from Shanghai are being telegraphed by radio.

The Municipal Social Bureau also telegraphed the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department to inform all parties concerned to abide by the release of the boats in order to maintain the food supply for Shanghai's more than three million population.

### League of Nations Meeting Today

Gu Weijun Plans to Apply for Discussion of the Sino-Japanese War

[Geneva] League of Nations officials recently announced that Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to France, is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow afternoon to attend the League of Nations Assembly and the Executive Council meeting. He will submit an appeal to the League of Nations regarding the war between China and Japan. Regarding this matter, Dr. Hu Shize, the director of the Chinese office in the League of Nations, that is, the minister to Switzerland, had already received instructions and has not yet officially notified the League of Nations. The Chinese government had submitted a note to the League of Nations on the 30th of last month regarding the war between China and Japan, accusing Japan of violating the League of Nations Covenant and other existing treaties, but did not make any conclusions. Generally, until the last few days, in order to fulfill its obligations as a member state and obtain moral support, it was decided to formally file an appeal. According to Article 11, Paragraph 2 of the Covenant, "Any circumstance affecting international relations, which threatens to disturb international peace or the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends, any member State has the right, in a friendly manner, to bring it to the attention of the Assembly or the Executive Council. As to whether China will submit the appeal to the Executive Council or the League of Nations Assembly, it is not yet known. What is known is that the country will not take any action before the 13th of this month, that is, the opening of the League of Nations Assembly. Although the Executive Council is scheduled to meet first on the 10th, the first few days of the meeting will be devoted to discussing the Mediterranean issue, and there will be no time to take into account anything else. In addition, the League of Nations will not decide to impose sanctions on Japan after China submits its appeal. Chinese people here firmly believe that the League of Nations will recognize Japan as an aggressor at that time, so some countries will not be able to declare neutrality and prohibit the sale of military goods to China. (Central News Agency, Havana, August 8)

[Geneva] Regarding the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty, which is rumored to be aimed at communizing China, the country's delegation to the League of Nations recently issued a statement solemnly denying it and recalled the text of Article 3 of the treaty, which states, "The provisions of this treaty shall not be interpreted as affecting or modifying the rights and obligations of the two Contracting Parties arising under any bilateral or multilateral treaties already concluded by the two Contracting Parties before the entry into force of this treaty." It stated that according to Article 6 of the Sino-Soviet Outline Agreement on the Settlement of Outstanding Issues of 1924, the two contracting parties agreed that they would not tolerate any organization that conspired to overthrow the other party's government and would not adopt propaganda movements that were inconsistent with the other party's political and social organization. This obligation does not change due to the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty. (Central Daily, Havana, August 8)

### The United States Still Focuses on Maintaining Treaties in the Far East Situation

Does Not Evade Responsibility for the Nine-Power Treaty, Withdrawal of Overseas Chinese is to Cope With Peace Groups

[Washington] US officials today are unwilling to publicly express their opinions on the so-called US prestige in the Far East by the US overseas Chinese in Shanghai, but they unanimously believe that the US government's decision to keep warships stationed in China and to take firm diplomatic action at any time are all sufficient to safeguard the US interests and principles and treaty rights. On the contrary, a large number of US overseas Chinese residing in China are not sufficient to safeguard the prestige of the United States, but are enough to cause danger, causing the US government to face disputes and not be able to act freely. If an incident occurs without the withdrawal of overseas Chinese, domestic public opinion will inevitably demand that the President implement the Neutrality Act, which will have a greater impact on the prestige and power of the United States in the Far East than the withdrawal of overseas Chinese. If the US government is mired in such a situation, it will be tantamount to evading the responsibility for guaranteeing China's sovereignty stipulated by the Nine-Power Treaty, which was initiated by the United States. Moreover, even without an incident, those at home who demand the implementation of the Neutrality Act have made it difficult for the government to deal with. If there are further American casualties, President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull will not be able to continue to refuse this demand. The American overseas Chinese in Shanghai do not understand the strong domestic political demands for neutrality and avoiding war, and President Roosevelt's remarks on Block Island last Sunday were intended to respond to these demands. However, its true meaning is no different from Secretary of State Hull's repeated declarations, but the tone is stronger, so as to reassure domestic peace groups, newspaper commentators, and anti-government factions. The president's words have now taken effect at home. For example, six peace groups have written to the president today, saying, "Foreign American overseas Chinese call your withdrawal of overseas Chinese a cowardly move, but we call it common sense. It is not cowardly to protect the interests of the whole country instead of focusing on the interests of a few people." (National Electric, August 8)

[Washington] US Secretary of Commerce Roper declared today that the war or the threat of war has not, so far, hindered the US domestic and foreign industry and commerce. The American people are united in demanding and determined to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war, but the world situation also makes the US government deeply concerned. US shipping is harmed not only in the Far East but also in the Mediterranean. Secretary of State Hull discussed ways to deal with this with Maritime Commission Director Kennedy today. According to Hull, no special measures have yet been taken to protect US commercial points, nor has a plan to increase warships been decided. (National Electric, August 8)

[Washington] Six national peace groups jointly telegraphed President Roosevelt, asking him to quickly implement the Neutrality Act for the Sino-Japanese War and withdraw the army and navy stationed in China to prevent "another Lusitania or Maine from being sunk by someone, resulting in irreparable war."

### US Over Twenty Organizations Launch Universal Peace Movement

Worldwide Promotion to Begin on the 19th of This Month, Secretary of State Hull to Deliver Initial Speech

[New York] More than twenty US organizations, encompassing 25 million members, are scheduled to launch a worldwide peace promotion campaign starting on the 19th of this month. Secretary of State Hull will deliver the inaugural speech that day. This promotion campaign is based on the following four points: ㊀ Stop economic warfare; ㊁ Economically disarm and implement arms reduction; ㊂ Adopt proactive economic measures such as (A) establishing international agreements to improve working conditions, (B) granting all countries convenient access to raw materials, (C) basing international trade on equal treatment and eliminating discrimination, (D) stabilizing international currencies; ㊃ Conduct investigations into the work of the League of Nations and the International Labor Bureau to ensure fairer economic and social relations between nations.

[New York] Retired US Major General Sterling published an article in the New York Sun today, titled "Is Intervention Against Japan Possible?" He first compared the naval strengths of Britain, the United States, France, and Japan, then asserted that Japan dared to act so recklessly in China because it knew the possibility of European countries uniting against Japan was slim. Therefore, Japan's current dominance in East Asia stems from the inability of European and American countries to determine their policy in the Far East and to back it with their navies. He stated that an understanding between European and American countries is not impossible. If it becomes a reality and their combined fleet forces Japan to cease its acts of aggression in China, Japan will either face self-destruction or surrender. (National Telegram, 8th)

[New York] The New York Public Opinion Newspaper commented today on Japan's reply to Britain, stating that based on the content of this reply, Japan clearly anticipates that Britain, given the current European situation, will not take severe measures against Japan. When Japan launched its aggression against China, Britain was mired in an extreme economic panic, to the point of abandoning its gold standard. When Japan carried out the second phase of its aggression against China, Britain was entangled in Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. Now, it is bound by the Spanish Civil War and the conflicting relations between Italy and Germany, and Soviet Russia, caused by this war. Every time Japan intensifies its atrocities in China, Britain invariably faces unexpected constraints that tie its hands, which is indeed unfortunate. Therefore, Japan can now afford to ignore Britain's note and demands regarding the injury of Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, just as it did to Secretary of State Stimson's note in 1931.

### British Cabinet Holds Two Meetings

Discussing the International Situation

[London] The Cabinet met twice today to discuss the international situation. While the Far East incident is equally serious, cabinet members are more concerned about developments closer to Britain. The British government hopes that Japan's final reply regarding the Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen injury case will not be delayed too long and that it will be of a nature that is more satisfactory to the British government. The two cabinet meetings lasted a total of three and a half hours, chaired by Prime Minister Chamberlain. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 8th)

[London] The Cabinet held a regular meeting this afternoon to discuss the Far East situation. They studied the "temporary" reply submitted by Japan regarding the attack on the British Ambassador to China, Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. It is reported that the meeting decided to wait for several days for Japan to submit a formal reply. Whether Britain will take various measures, such as recalling its ambassador to Japan, will be decided after reviewing the reply. In addition, the Cabinet also discussed the Mediterranean issue and reportedly decided that the Mediterranean conference should still be held as scheduled, regardless of whether Italy and Germany participate. If those countries refuse to participate, the originally planned location, Nyon, will be changed to Geneva. Furthermore, the original plan to set boundaries within which submarines of the countries involved can navigate along their coasts, without being allowed to cross them, will also be cancelled to avoid a permanent state of hostility in the Mediterranean. Instead, warships of the countries involved will escort merchant ships on the main shipping lanes in the Mediterranean. However, this method may be opposed by France, so changes may occur after Foreign Secretary Eden meets with French Foreign Minister Delbos in Paris tomorrow. Finally, the Cabinet also discussed the Abyssinian issue and decided that the British delegation would not initiate anything in Geneva. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 8th)

Dr. Jones recently returned to India from the United States and, while passing through Shanghai, drafted a three-thousand-word letter to the Japanese people, urging them to lay down their arms as soon as possible to avoid regretting it later. The letter stated that the current Japanese aggression against China is the greatest international crime, that this act not only antagonizes China but also disrupts international peace, and so on. However, the Japanese people are now controlled by their warlords, and the doctor's advice is like throwing water on a stone, ineffective. However, it is enough to show a glimpse of public opinion.

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Refugee Relief Problem

— Ren

Since the start of the war of resistance, large numbers of refugees have emerged from military zones everywhere. These are people who have lost their livelihoods due to the war. Currently, Shanghai alone has at least a hundred thousand people. These hundred thousand people have now escaped the war zone with their lives. However, where is their destination in the vast future? Keeping refugees in cities and relying solely on shelters and relief is naturally not a solution. Similarly, this kind of unplanned repatriation is hardly a good policy. This unplanned repatriation merely results in one less group of refugees in location A and one more group of refugees in location B. The serious problem of refugees remains fundamentally unresolved. Furthermore, the current war of resistance is by no means a local affair. If location A can become a war zone today, what's to say location B can't become a war zone tomorrow? Then, they will be repatriated from location B to location C. Such a repeated migration will only result in an increasing number of refugees and an increasingly chaotic rear.

Therefore, fundamental refugee relief cannot be effectively achieved by relying solely on passive shelters and repatriation. A thorough solution must be approached from a proactive perspective. This so-called proactive approach can be divided into two points.

First, is to enable those who have already become refugees to regain a path to livelihood.

Second, is to prevent those who have not yet become refugees from becoming refugees.

Regarding the first point, the Executive Yuan recently passed a set of measures for refugee relief during this extraordinary period. The main contents are: ㊀ Establish a general relief committee in the capital, with branches in various locations, to handle relief matters. ㊁ Refugees without working ability will be sheltered locally or moved to nearby areas. ㊂ Refugees with working ability will be properly allocated, taking into account the number of people and the working environment, and sent to their respective towns to assist in production or transportation. Alternatively, they will be assigned work within local defense organizations and other groups. ㊃ Those refugees who wish to serve in the military will have their families taken care of. ㊄ Provide education for refugee children who have dropped out of school. ㊅ The funds for the general relief committee will come from the central disaster relief reserve fund and designated special funds or donations. The funds for the branches will come from the original relief organizations and charitable groups' funds, local disaster relief funds, and donations. This approach is naturally a very proactive measure. If it can be implemented in an orderly manner according to the law, we believe there will definitely be results. If not, we cannot help but offer some supplementary opinions here. ㊀ This approach still lacks regulations regarding the relationship between the general and branch committees (the county branches are stipulated to be under the unified planning of the provincial branches). Precisely because this war of resistance is comprehensive, everything should have a unified plan. For example, which places can accommodate refugees without working ability? Also, for example, where should refugees with working ability go to produce? What should they produce? All of these must be planned comprehensively at the national level and decided by the general committee, then issued to the branch committees for execution. If the relationship is not specified and each province acts independently, we fear that many shortcomings will arise in the future. ㊁ A special arrangement should be made for skilled mechanical laborers among the refugees. These people should not only not be dispersed or allowed to engage in other work, but should also be quickly ordered to concentrate in the rear. Not only are these laborers workers in wartime industries themselves, but they can also train many new mechanical laborers, increasing the strength of wartime production. ㊂ We believe that refugees with working ability should be planned by the relief committee to designate appropriate venues, classified and gathered according to their profession before being assigned to work. For example, classified and gathered according to farmers, textile workers, match workers, etc. Those with too few people in the same profession can be grouped together with similar professions. In this way, when workers are needed, they can be quickly summoned.

Regarding the second point, how to prevent those who have not yet become refugees from becoming refugees. The government has not yet promulgated a suitable approach to this problem, but we seem to have several opinions that we can contribute. ㊀ In places that may become war zones in the near future, measures should be prepared in advance to engage in the organization of the people. For example, with farmers, villages and towns should be quickly organized to unite and plan for future development. In this way, once something happens, they can quickly retreat to a new destination as a group and engage in production again. Or, for example, factories. Those that can be relocated should be relocated first. Otherwise, workers should be organized in advance to plan for future destinations. Five minutes before the enemy approaches, the entire staff, machinery, and raw materials should be evacuated to the new destination as quickly as possible. If this can be done in a proactive manner, it will certainly not be as embarrassing as the refugees in Shanghai today. ㊁ Factories, shops, and institutions in various locations can reduce salaries or increase working hours for all employees during this extraordinary period, but layoffs should be strictly prohibited. We know that laying off one person means losing the livelihood of one person or one family, which also means one or more refugees. At this time, it is better for everyone to eat one less bowl of rice, but everyone must eat the rice. Recently, some shops and institutions in Shanghai have nominally kept salaries intact, but have laid off many employees in tangible and intangible ways. This self-deceiving strategy of creating refugees should be improved in any case. Taking a step back, even if layoffs are necessary due to unavoidable reasons, those with high incomes should be laid off. In this way, although one person becomes unemployed and becomes a refugee, it has prevented several or dozens of low-income earners from becoming refugees. Moreover, in fact, because high-income earners usually have rich incomes and more savings, they may not become refugees even if they are laid off.

### Germany and Italy Refuse to Participate in Mediterranean Conference

Using Soviet Russia's Provocation as an Excuse; Conference Scheduled to Proceed Today in Rome

[Rome] Regarding the invitation from Britain and France to participate in the Mediterranean Conference, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano presented a reply to the British and Italian chargé d'affaires, White Longtel, and the French chargé d'affaires in Italy, England, this morning, stating that the Italian government had originally intended to accept this invitation. However, because the Soviet Union had sent two notes to Italy, the Italian government decided to postpone its consent until the dispute between Italy and the Soviet Union was satisfactorily resolved. However, the Italian government is prepared to promptly conduct talks with the relevant countries, which should be conducted within the London Non-Intervention Committee, so that countries not invited to participate in the Nyon Conference, such as Portugal and Poland, can also attend. In addition, the Italian government still intends to continue to participate in the Non-Intervention Committee. If the Mediterranean issue is submitted to the Committee for discussion, the Italian government is prepared to instruct its representatives to attend. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 9th)

[Berlin] Regarding participation in the Mediterranean Conference, the German government presented replies to the British ambassador and the French chargé d'affaires this morning, stating that the German government had originally prepared to cooperate with various countries on this matter. However, due to the Soviet Union's repeated provocations against Italy, the German government fears that the Mediterranean Conference will fail. Therefore, it proposes that the Mediterranean issue should be submitted to the Non-Intervention Committee for discussion, so that countries not invited to participate in the Nyon Conference can also attend. (Central News Agency, 9th)

[Rome] After Italy and Germany exchanged opinions for several days regarding the Mediterranean Conference, a result was reached today. Officials here declared that the Italian government will respond to the invitations from Britain and France soon. In addition, according to those in charge in Italy, the Soviet government's two notes to Italy regarding the sinking of Italian ships by submarines have made it increasingly difficult for Germany and Italy to participate in the Mediterranean Conference. Political figures believe that the Soviet Union, seeing that relations between Britain and Italy have improved, will be isolated. Therefore, it is engaging in divisive tactics, hoping to reverse this. However, Italy is currently dismissing this strategy of the Soviet Union. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 8th)

[Paris] Foreign Minister Delbos met with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Hirschfeld, and Spanish Republican Government Premier Negrin this morning. The French delegation to the Mediterranean Conference is said to be composed of Foreign Minister Delbos, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Darlan, Deputy Chief of Staff Admiral Godfroy, and several senior officials from the Foreign Ministry. Those in charge declared that after ships of various countries in the Mediterranean were attacked, the situation is becoming increasingly serious, and various measures must be taken immediately to prevent new incidents from occurring. Foreign Minister Delbos is now scheduled to leave for Geneva at 10:20 tomorrow evening with British Foreign Secretary Eden. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 8th)

⊙The capital of Bulgaria State Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Gusset Vanov, departed this afternoon for Nyon, Switzerland, to attend the Mediterranean Conference. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 8th)

[London] Greece, Romania, the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, and Egypt accepted the invitation yesterday. Yugoslavia and Turkey also accepted the invitation. Currently, only Germany, Italy, and Albania have not replied. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 8th)

[Paris] The Navy has ordered the 5th Destroyer Fleet to prepare to sail to the Mediterranean to increase the strength of the French fleet stationed in the Mediterranean. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 9th)

[London] Chief of Naval Staff Chatfield led several naval experts to Paris at 2:00 this afternoon to go to Geneva to attend the Mediterranean Conference. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 9th)

### South City's Longhua Suffers Rampant Destruction

Yesterday morning, at around 7:00 AM, a large squadron of enemy bombers flew to bomb the South City and western Shanghai. It is estimated that at 7:20 AM, they flew to the area of Rihui Bridge outside the South City, the northern end of Beipiao Wharf, and Longhua Road, dropping more than ten bombs, destroying more than fifty civilian houses and killing and injuring thirty to forty civilians. The Longtong Machine Paper Mill in that area was also hit by two bombs, injuring two workers. They then returned after scattering absurd and ridiculous leaflets that were not worth laughing at in the city of South City. At around 1:30 PM in the afternoon, several enemy planes flew to Rihui Bridge, Longhua Road, Dapu Bridge, Gaochangmiao Guangdong Street, Chenjiaqiao, and other areas, dropping as many as twenty bombs. Fortunately, the residents in the area were prepared and hid in a room in advance. Only a few coolies and poor people were unable to escape and were injured by the bombs. The injured civilians were rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment by the West District Rescue Shen and Red Cross rescue teams. The corpses of those killed by the bombs have been buried by the Tongren Fuyuan Hall and Pushan Villa burial teams. However, the corpses in the collapsed houses are still being searched for and buried. Also, the Zhengnan Grocery Store at No. 935 Longhua Road, the rice stores at No. 937, No. 939, No. 941, and other market houses, and Gengyu Lane at No. 933, were all set on fire and extinguished by the fire brigades from the West and South districts.

Yesterday morning, several enemy planes suddenly scattered a large number of leaflets over the city of South City. There were about four types, and the wording and content were absurd and ridiculous. Citizens who picked them up scoffed after reading them. They thought they had exhausted their ability to provoke and threaten and were smug, but we already knew that they were at the end of their rope and that their efforts were in vain.

### Yinxiang Township Also Bombed

Yesterday from 10:00 to 11:00 AM, the central area of the city suffered heavy bombing. The vicinity of the Far East Sports Ground was also occasionally attacked by artillery fire.

### Stray Bullets Injure People in the Central District of the Concession

㊀ Yesterday at around 5:45 PM, a shell suddenly fell from the sky near the Central Police Station on Fuzhou Road, Jiangxi Road, and exploded immediately. At that time, more than twenty passers-by were injured, and several died instantly. The remaining injured were quickly sent to Renji Hospital for treatment in three ambulances dispatched by the Central Police Station. On the one hand, the police collected the shrapnel and, after studying it, determined that it was a high-altitude artillery shell fired from a Japanese warship. It was also heard that, apart from slight damage to the road surface and the shaking of the glass windows on both sides of the buildings, there was no major damage at the bombing site. ㊁ At 2:30 PM, a huge artillery shell fell on the houses at No. 112, No. 96, No. 33, and other houses at No. 90 Long Makgen Road, Wuding Road. The sound shook far and wide, and several houses were destroyed on the spot, but fortunately no one was injured. ㊂ At around 3:00 PM, while the Yihe Silk Filature at No. 1037 North Chengdu Road was working, an artillery shell as big as a flower tube suddenly flew into the window of the building, and with a loud noise, many female workers were injured by the bombing and were sent to the hospital by car. Two female workers died of serious injuries. At the same time, one man and one woman were killed by stray bullets in Siwen Lane.

### Impressions of American Residents Leaving

Western newspapers report various opinions; the main views of American merchants in this port.

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reports: "Today (the 9th), news was received in Shanghai that the 1,200 American residents gathered in Hankou will take the Yuehan Railway to Guangzhou tomorrow. Among them are family members of the Hankou American Consulate staff, as well as American merchants and missionaries and their families from surrounding areas. The Hankou American Consulate will continue to operate as usual. This morning, when Western newspaper reporters met with Japanese military authorities, someone asked if Japanese aircraft would attack the train. Spokespersons for the Japanese Army and Navy stated that they had not yet received notification of the train's departure. It is likely that the Japanese Embassy has received this notification. As this train is neutral, Japanese aircraft will naturally not bomb it." The "North China Daily News" reports that American merchants in Shanghai with professional businesses reiterated yesterday (the 8th) their decision to remain in Shanghai and not abandon their vested interests due to the temporary dangers to their lives and property caused by the Sino-Japanese War. American residents in China have generally been lukewarm to President Roosevelt's warning that all Americans should leave China. Several American merchants in this port hold the view that the U.S. government will no longer protect Americans and their interests in China, believing it's a matter of "every man for himself". One person even said that the U.S. government's action is merely to appease several powerful peace advocacy groups. Admiral Yarnell, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, is still following government orders and issued a notice last night regarding procedures for American residents leaving China, planning to use several warships to transport American residents out of China, and listing the departure dates of the ships from Shanghai.

The institute has trained no less than a thousand alumni. In recent years, these alumni have been distributed in various sectors, including Party and government administration, the military, industry, finance, law, and the press, and are mostly talented, hardworking, and experienced individuals.

### British Firms Butterfield & Swire and Jardine Matheson Restore Shanghai-Tianjin Routes

Regular operation of foreign ships on upper and middle Yangtze River routes

British shipping companies Butterfield & Swire and Jardine Matheson, in order to maintain China's coastal shipping, have restored the following routes: (1) Southern Route: Shanghai, Xiamen, Shantou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou.

### British Public Bus Company's Wage Reduction Strike Settled

Representatives of all employees of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, including Jin Zhizhi, submitted requests to Party and government agencies for mediation due to the company's layoffs and wage reductions. The Municipal Party Committee sent Li Weixiong, and the Bureau of Social Affairs sent Du Liang to mediate. They persuaded the workers to maintain order in the rear during the war of resistance and not to take rash actions. After investigation, it was found that the company had no intention of laying off employees, but only temporarily reduced wages to half-pay. Compared to other factories that have suspended operations and caused unemployment, this should not be considered a major grievance. After thorough discussions, the workers expressed their understanding, and the strike at the company has been settled.

### Rōnin and Traitors Use Poisoned Candy to Lure and Kill Children

Police agencies on high alert; attention of children's families

Recently, Japanese and Korean rōnin and traitors have been making highly poisonous drugs into pills, coated with a sugar shell, in red, yellow, white, and other colors, resembling ordinary candies. They distribute these pills to unsuspecting children along the way. After eating the pills, the children are poisoned and cannot be saved.

### Unprecedented Artillery Battle This Afternoon

Extremely intense artillery fire shook the city; our forces firmly defend the Qiujiang Wharf and Jungong Road; our troops have recovered Wujiazai in Luodian.

As of 3:00 PM today, although the enemy has tried its best to fiercely attack our army's positions on all fronts, our army is firmly defending its original lines, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. The main points of the battle situation are as follows: (1) The Qiujiang Wharf area remains the focus of the battle. Enemy warships in the Huangpu River and heavy enemy artillery in Yangshupu fiercely bombed our Yinxianggang positions this morning. Our army fought back with all its might, killing countless enemies. Currently, there are no traces of the enemy in the area west of Jungong Road and north of Wuquan Road. (2) The enemy in Wusong and Baoshan attacked our positions northeast of Yanghang in two directions. After a bloody battle, they have been repelled. We are firmly defending our original lines. (3) Fierce fighting is taking place in the Yuepu area. The enemy is suffering heavy casualties, and our lines remain unmoved. (4) In the Luodian area, after fierce fighting last night, our army has recovered Wujiaqiao and Xiaojintang north of Changqiao. (5) In the Zhabei area, the enemy launched several assaults last night and this morning, but all were repelled by our army. The enemy suffered extremely heavy losses. (6) Enemy warships in the Huangpu River fiercely bombed our Pudong positions starting at 10:30 AM today. Our army's heavy artillery also returned fire, and the intense artillery fire continued until 2:00 PM before stopping.

### Our Artillery Units Display Their Power

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Starting at 10:30 AM this morning, enemy warships in the Huangpu River again shelled our Pudong positions. Our army's heavy artillery immediately returned fire. By 11:00 AM, our artillery fire became even more intense, shaking all of Shanghai. It concentrated on the Japanese Mail Steamship Company pier, enemy warships in the Huangpu River, and enemy military positions in eastern Shanghai. Unable to withstand our intense firepower, the enemy ordered five enemy aircraft to take off at 12:05 PM to scout out our army's artillery positions in Pudong. They circled for about a quarter of an hour and dropped four bombs, all of which landed in the fields and did not explode. The enemy aircraft then left in disappointment at 12:30 PM. However, in less than five minutes, our army's artillery units continued their activity, and the enemy warships also returned fire. As of the time of publication, both sides were still fiercely exchanging fire.

### Enemy Warship Nearly Hit

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) This morning, a very large Red Cross medical ship belonging to the enemy arrived in the Huangpu River and docked at the Mitsubishi pier to collect wounded enemy soldiers and transport bodies onto the ship. An enemy Yangtze River shallow-draft warship was anchored in the center of the river outside the Chunjiang pier for protection. Enemy ship number 30 was anchored in front of the Zhaoshang Middle Pier, and the enemy flagship Izumo was docked at the second river pier, with a destroyer nearby to protect it. At around 5:00 AM this morning, enemy warships in the Huangpu River began firing on Pudong. By 10:50 AM, the artillery fire became increasingly dense. The four enemy warships fired in rotation, firing about one shell every minute. At 11:05 AM, our artillery also returned fire with heavy guns. With a loud bang, the reporter witnessed a wisp of black smoke falling straight towards the river in front of the Chunjiang pier. The shell landed in the Huangpu River outside the port side of the enemy warship, no more than a few feet from the bow of the ship, almost hitting it. The enemy warship was panicked and quickly turned its bow to the right, while enemy ship number 30, which was docked at the Middle Pier, indiscriminately bombarded the Huangpu River.

(Latest News from This Newspaper) The reporter learned from reliable sources that the reason for the fierce artillery battle that occurred this afternoon was that our military authorities had received confidential reports that the enemy warships had recently transported a large number of heavy artillery and giant tanks and other heavy weapons, which were scheduled to be unloaded ashore at the Huishan and other piers in eastern Shanghai at around 12:00 noon today. Therefore, our army immediately ordered our forces in Pudong to bombard the piers fiercely to blunt their edge.

### Jungong Road Still in Fierce Fighting

Our troops charged into melee combat more than ten times; the enemy suffered attacks from the front and rear, with heavy casualties.

At Qiujiang Wharf, our forces and the enemy forces continue to fiercely battle day and night, holding each other in the Jungong Road area. Enemy warships in the Huangpu River are constantly shelling our positions with fierce artillery fire, and more than ten enemy aircraft are flying low and bombing our positions. Our defending army bravely fought, charging into melee combat more than ten times. The intensity of the battle is unprecedented. Yesterday evening, the enemy was repelled. In the evening, our army's unit attacked the enemy near Fengjiazai from near Lujiazai and Huojiazai, attacking from the front and rear. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and could not hold out, and retreated eastward along Jungong Road. Currently, there are no traces of the enemy north of Wuquan Road and west of Jungong Road.

(Special Reading from This Newspaper) In the past three days, bloody battles have fully unfolded on all fronts in Shanghai. Among them, the line from Qiujiang Wharf to Jungong Road has been the fiercest. The following is an approximate record of what a military officer who participated in the battle on that line said: (1) The enemy has been continuously increasing reinforcements at Qiujiang Wharf in the past few days, especially many of them. According to reports, since the war front has been expanding outwards, the enemy is launching an all-out attack, but it is still difficult for all fronts to develop. Therefore, it is seeking another way out, attempting to seize the city center to Jiangwan area in one fell swoop and cut off our army's rear. However, our side was prepared and the enemy's plan became a dream after two days of attack. (2) Yesterday at dawn, when the enemy advanced from Qiujiang Wharf across Jungong Road, it used six heavy tanks as the vanguard, followed by infantry and artillery. The momentum was extremely fierce. A certain unit of our army calmly responded to the attack. For about half an hour, it had charged into our position. Later, reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce attack, with every shot hitting the target. The enemy could not withstand it and retreated backwards. We took advantage of the victory to pursue and eliminate them, not only recapturing the position, but also advancing to a distance of three li away and building a new position. The enemy suffered a heavy blow from this and did not dare to attack again. (3) Yesterday at 10:00 AM, more than twenty enemy aircraft hovered over the city center and bombed indiscriminately. The intention was nothing more than to vent their anger over the failure of the attack. At that time, our army lay still in the trenches to avoid their edge. The enemy aircraft did not leave until about 1:00 PM. Within these three hours, shells rained down, at least 500 or more. Our soldiers suffered more than 60 casualties, but countless civilian houses were destroyed. (4) On all fronts, our army has sufficient strength and proper equipment. If the enemy comes to attack, we will surely eliminate them and will not stop until the enemy is wiped out.

### Enemy in Wusong Attacks Yanghang

Fierce fighting between the two sides northeast of Yanghang; the enemy was defeated and fled in a panic.

### Enemy's Main Force Attacks the Yuepu Line

We Responded Fiercely and Destroyed Enemy Vehicles; the Enemy Was Forced to Retreat with Many Deaths

On the Yuepu line, extremely fierce fighting occurred last night. The enemy attacked with its main force, with more than ten tanks operating on the front line, followed by infantry. At the same time, enemy warships in the river bombarded our positions with continuous heavy artillery fire, and enemy aircraft were also active in the air. Shells and bombs rained down. Our defending army calmly responded to the attack and used mortars to aim at the enemy vehicles and bombard them fiercely, destroying many of them. The enemy was forced to retreat, and our army firmly defended its original positions, standing still. In last night's battle, our defending army suffered approximately more than one hundred casualties, and the enemy's deaths were countless.

### We Recaptured Wujiazai in Luodian

Two Enemy Tanks Destroyed

In the Luodian area, after our army recaptured key areas such as Changqiao and Fengjiazai the day before yesterday, the enemy army launched a fierce counterattack against our army. Fierce battles broke out between the two armies in Wujiazai and Xiaojintang. Our army followed each other, charging with hand grenades and other weapons, and destroyed two enemy tanks. The enemy suffered too many casualties and retreated. Our army advanced and completely recovered Wujiazai and other places. According to reports, the enemy's main force is concentrated on the Luodian and Yuepu lines, attempting to establish contact on these two lines. The enemy forces near Changquan are only a small group.

### Air Battle Occurred in Zhabei This Morning

Enemy Aircraft Dropped Two Bombs in Nanshi Without Damage; Reconnaissance Aircraft Straſed Villages in Pudong

From 6:00 AM to 7:00 AM this morning, three enemy aircraft dropped bombs on our army's positions in the sky above Qingyun Road in Zhabei city center. Although our army used anti-aircraft artillery and anti-aircraft machine guns to bomb them at the time, the enemy aircraft still dropped bombs as usual. Later, a large force of our air force learned of this and rushed to the scene, and a fierce air battle broke out between the two sides. The sound of fighting shook the sky for about an hour. At about 7:00 AM, the enemy aircraft could not hold out and fled to the clouds and escaped to the east.

At about 6:00 AM this morning, another nine enemy aircraft flew from Nanshi along the river to Gaochangmiao and Longhua Road, dropping two bombs. The sound was huge, and the houses shook. After the investigation, they all landed in the mud, fortunately without damage.

At about 12:00 noon this morning, seven or eight Japanese aircraft flew to the area bordering ×× in Pudong, conducting reconnaissance separately, and using machine guns to strafe various villages, and releasing red and green flares to send signals to traitors. However, after our army's strict crackdown, traitors have greatly decreased, so the strange signals that were discovered in the past few days were not seen in various places. The enemy aircraft did not fly back until dawn.

### Enemy Warships Attacked Dason Port in Xiangshan

Our Big Guns Fired Back and the Enemy Warships Fled

Today, according to sailors who came to Shanghai from Ningbo, three enemy warships secretly entered Dason Port near Xiangshan on the morning of the 8th, changing their flags, and opened fire on Xianxiangbu and the mountain village to test them. After our army learned of this, it immediately came out to meet the attack and also used big guns to fire back. One of the enemy warships was hit by our artillery and its mast was broken. It immediately fled from the scene.

### Japan Plans to Use Italian-Soviet Estrangement to Promote the Anti-Comintern Pact Between Italy and Japan

Japanese Ambassadors to Britain and France Confer in London

[London] The Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Yoshida, and the Japanese Ambassador to France, Sugimura, recently held talks here, with particular emphasis on the establishment of an Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Italy. Regarding this meeting, Japanese officials in London were quite reticent but admitted that Sugimura had come to Britain from Paris to meet with Yoshida to discuss the international situation. They also stated that all countries opposed to communism could participate in the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany. As for the talks between Japan and Italy, they have been going on for some time, but have not yet reached the final stage. British sources familiar with the situation recently stated that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini gave a speech in Palermo last month, criticizing communism. Moreover, relations between the Soviet Union and Italy have become strained due to the Soviet ship attack incident. All of this makes it easier to expand the scope of the anti-communist group. (Central News Agency, 9th, Havas)

### Our Country's Confidence in Resistance Against Japan is Very Strong

Statement by Vice President Kong

[Berlin] Dr. Kong Xiangxi, who is currently recuperating at Bad Nauheim Spa, recently gave a statement to various newspapers, saying, "After the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, Japan complained a lot, but they should know that Germany had also established a Non-Aggression Treaty with Poland (January 26, 1934), and Poland had also signed a Non-Aggression Pact with the Soviet Union (July 3, 1933). This means that there is also an indirect relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union, and we have not said anything against Germany. Moreover, the German-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Neutrality (April 24, 1916) was extended in 1933 by the Third Reich. Japan seems to have forgotten this. According to the argument held by Japan, any country that signs a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union should be considered a Bolshevik country or at risk of being communist. If this is the case, then in addition to Poland, countries such as Finland and Turkey are also suspected of being communist." Vice President Kong then condemned Japan's actions, saying, "Where does Japan place international law in its unwarranted war against China? Japan promised to respect the Open Door Policy within 'Manchukuo.' Where is this principle now? Compared to other countries, China is not behind and has sufficient strength to live peacefully with any country. Japan's invasion of China is not the first time. The unification that China has worked so hard to achieve over the years has been strengthened by Japan's acts of aggression. At present, China is very confident and will never be discouraged by defeat or arrogant by victory," etc. (Central News Agency, 9th, Havas)

### Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Industries to Resume Business

Unless Absolutely Necessary, Businesses Should Remain Open as Usual

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a notice yesterday, stating that the Chamber has received instructions from the Municipal Government that businesses in all towns and cities should not be allowed to close unless absolutely necessary or ordered by the government. This is because the daily needs of frontline soldiers and urban residents are indispensable. Once business is suspended, it will not only cause difficulties for residents, but also result in the accumulation of goods and the inability to circulate them smoothly. Therefore, all industries in the city are notified that those that have already opened for business should circulate goods as much as possible and maintain the livelihoods of their employees, and those that have not yet opened for business should resume business as soon as possible. This is of utmost importance.

### Brief Comments

— Xiang

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that when Japanese planes bombed the South Railway Station, there were no soldiers to be seen. The day before yesterday, they bombed a refugee train departing from Shanghai in Songjiang, killing and injuring seven or eight hundred people. Their barbaric actions are truly like demons in the forest. Since the beginning of the Second Shanghai Incident, the enemy has brutally killed countless innocent people. Even a third party who sees this cannot help but feel righteous indignation and loudly denounce it. How should our people, who have experienced it firsthand, recognize this terrifying and ferocious face and engrave it permanently in their minds?

According to news from Baoding, the Third Division of the puppet Manchurian army, under enemy orders, traveled from Rehe to Chicheng and suddenly announced their revolt. This is both possible and inevitable. The reason why our country's troops rashly defected was nothing more than being lured and threatened by the enemy, causing their conscience and ability to be temporarily obscured. Now that they see our country's loyal and brave soldiers fighting bloody battles, pressing forward despite sacrifices, this spark of unawakened conscience must be struck and revived like the embers of a dying fire.

Special Report

### Writing to Friends Who Care About Relief Work (Part 2)

— Jiang Xiaoming

Currently, the work we urgently need to do is to build a bridge for military-civilian exchange. This means that our relief work on the Shanghai front cannot rely solely on the wounded soldier hospitals run by the people of Shanghai to accommodate as many people as possible. We need the military medical authorities to also take responsibility for accommodating wounded soldiers. In fact, the people have indeed taken on the responsibility of relief, and the military medical authorities have also taken on the responsibility of relief. Moreover, the distribution of military medical hospitals and hygiene stations has long been very detailed and equipped. Therefore, in order to adapt to the preparations for a protracted war of resistance, as long as we can do our best to channel wounded soldiers from Shanghai, we can complete our greatest task, and we can maintain the Shanghai wounded soldier hospitals' ability to continuously accommodate wounded soldiers without feeling panicked. Now, this bridge for military-civilian exchange has fortunately been built. Therefore, many people anxiously worry that the wounded soldier hospitals in Shanghai will not be enough to accommodate them. This is taking the Shanghai concessions too much as a safe rear and neglecting the capabilities and safe equipment of the military authorities. They also do not know the strength of the wounded soldier hospitals run by many people in the interior. Although we still hope that a large number of wounded soldier hospitals will appear in Shanghai, the bridge of military-civilian exchange that we should have does not allow us to ignore it, does not allow us to disregard the future situation of a protracted war of resistance, and sincerely hopes that anxious friends will contribute more financial and human resources and try to establish several large-scale wounded soldier hospitals.

I think the treatment of wounded soldiers should not be too generous, nor should it be too meager. For example, if a wounded soldier has already suffered a serious injury, no matter how delicious and delicious you give him, he will not be able to enjoy it. If they suddenly become pampered after just coming out of a difficult and dangerous environment, this change in psychology can easily lead to people's laziness and complacency. Seeing this once will only be harmful to the future of the war of resistance and not beneficial. The most ideal hope is that we only need to give them some palatable food and relatively nutritious food, which is very good. I think it is better to expand the number of beds and accommodate more injured people with the money that has too much consumption, which is more practical. As for people who genuinely abuse wounded soldiers, they should not only be condemned by their conscience, but also be abandoned and condemned by 400 million compatriots. We pray that China will no longer see such people who are equivalent to traitors.

Regarding consolation matters, of course, they need to be centrally distributed. I very much hope that there will also be a special organization for consolation. Otherwise, it is also a solution to concentrate on the Red Cross or local associations for distribution. Many people think that personally going to the wounded soldiers' beds to console them will give themselves more comfort, and the wounded soldiers will also be comforted. In fact, talking more with the wounded soldiers consumes more of the wounded soldiers' energy, providing more consolation food to the wounded soldiers causes more gastrointestinal diseases, and even traitors take the opportunity of consolation to spy on military information. Shameless people see that consolation is profitable and want to run wounded soldier hospitals by operating under the guise of absorbing consolation items to enrich their own pockets. The number of malpractices is countless. If there is an agency for consolation items that can be centrally distributed, first, all the wounded soldiers in Shanghai can enjoy them equally in terms of materials, and second, in terms of spirit, some specialized consolation service talents can be trained. Within the prescribed time, they can give the wounded soldiers the most needed comfort and considerable education, and serve them in practice. Like the spirit, methods, and discipline of today's children's service team, it is a very good example.

To what extent has the relief work been done today? Of course, I cannot answer rashly. As a certain gentleman aptly put it, it is better to do it than not to do it. Just like the families who have always hosted weddings, funerals, and joyous occasions, how can they be completely satisfactory? The result is the same. We are very willing to work hard to improve in various ways without taking the peaceful method, with daydreams, regardless of the facts, , don't think about steps, just split hairs, and don't seek the source, you can improve the relief work. We must not criticize or blame people lightly without having personally experienced it or considered it carefully. A certain female doctor once absurdly said that without using blood transfusion therapy, all therapies are 18th-century therapies. This serious mistake shows that many accidental events are too easily emotionally impulsive without taking time to choose words. How can the layman's words of a doctor, which are spoken without thinking, affect the society's anger among people who do not know medicine!

Finally, I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will give enthusiastic support to relief work. We cannot overestimate the level of relief work, nor can we underestimate it. Those who preside over and handle relief work cannot laugh and scold others. We must take care of ourselves. We must prepare for long-term savings, not fight for fear, and on the two principles that relief of wounded soldiers and medical treatment of wounded soldiers should be given equal importance, how to treat wounded soldiers well, how to transport wounded soldiers, how to educate wounded soldiers, how to respect sudden changes in unified places, how to respect the decisions of central relief agencies, how to concentrate talents and resources, how to achieve military-civilian exchanges, how to rescue wounded soldiers on the battlefield, and how to make healed wounded soldiers more ambitious to kill the enemy, This is the direction for improving relief work, and it is also a victory for the Chinese nation in the overall war of resistance.

### Beijing Municipal Government Implements Community-Based Joint Defense

Strengthening the Self-Defense Power of the People and Persuading Traitors to Quickly Repent

South East Communication reports that in order to adapt to the needs of the extraordinary period and strengthen the people's self-defense power, the Beijing Municipal Government has convened representatives from party, government, military police, and other agencies to decide on handling community-based joint defense matters. It is heard that in the urban area, the Municipal Government has decided to appoint two joint defense organizers per district to go to each district to assist the district offices in organizing. The honorary joint defense organizers will be appointed by the Municipal Government upon request from each district and institute, and will be held by leaders of legal entities in each district or local respected figures who are enthusiastic about serving. The organization of joint defense will establish a total of 64 groups in the entire urban area, with one group leader per group. However, depending on the actual needs, one or three deputy group leaders will be set up, and a joint defense office will be set up for every ten groups, with one director, one or two deputy directors, and one clerk, all of whom will be appointed by the Municipal Government. As for the joint defense procedures, households will be registered first, with each house number being one household. If there are more than two families in one house number, it will still be counted as one household and numbered as the number of the district, group, and household. The police house number will be used as the district group household number to avoid re-making house numbers. After the joint defense households have completed their organization, they will prepare a clear list of household heads, a brief description of the group and joint defense, and the joint defense director and deputy director will lead the household heads and Zhuang Ding to assist the district head in handling self-defense work during the extraordinary period. Each group should also convene joint defense meetings of household heads at any time to agree on regulations. If necessary, joint defense pledges may also be held.

The Beijing Municipal Government also stated that this war of resistance against Japan is truly the last juncture for the survival of our Chinese nation. All of our compatriots, even those with a little bit of blood, are determined to fight the enemy to the end. Whether it is the soldiers at the front or the people in the rear, although their tasks are different, their determination to risk death to revive our nation and consolidate our country is the same. However, in recent days, a small number of people with lost hearts and mad minds have been found in various places, taking advantage of the enemy's temporary petty profits, disregarding our entire nation, and willingly becoming traitors. Their crime is unforgivable, and their foolishness is also pitiful. Therefore, we do not hesitate to make a final appeal, hoping that they will quickly wake up, briefly stating: ㊀ Some people become traitors because they are unemployed and have no choice. However, they do not know that unemployment is a temporary setback for an individual. If they are not disabled, there is no reason to be unemployed for life. Recently, the government is rescuing unemployed people. If unemployed people apply for relief, the government will properly find ways to help them. Why bother to be greedy for temporary petty profits and act as accomplices for tigers, leaving endless shame for their descendants? ㊁ The people rely on the state for protection. Since they have the happiness of co-existence and co-prosperity, they should do their best to be loyal and sincerely love the state. If they are ignorant of the great righteousness and confused by petty profits, and willingly become traitors, try asking what will happen if the country is destroyed and the family perishes? Even the ancestral tombs cannot be protected. How can they stand in the world? ㊂ Enemy planes often use traitors to send out signals during night raids. This matter is especially cruel, because when bombs are dropped, people are caught off guard and cannot avoid them. Then the traitors themselves will be crushed to pieces. ㊃ Criminal acts are not allowed by law. However, in light of human nature, there may be those who slightly overlook their traces and forgive their hearts. Only those who willingly act as traitors are said to be killed by the people of the country. The ancestors for three generations are cursed for thousands of years, and their shameful reputation cannot be washed away. What could be more shameful? The above four points are extremely clear. Even the most foolish people can easily do it. If there are shameless people who have strayed into the wrong path and can repent after this persuasion, the government will be magnanimous and will not blame the past and will give them a new life. If they still do not listen to persuasion, then they are stubbornly ignorant and isolated from the people of the country. The national law is in place and will kill without pardon.

### Major Espionage Ring Uncovered in Quanzhou

Named "Sino-Japanese Anti-Communist Fraternal Association"; Possesses a "Sino-Japanese Anti-Communist Army" Structure

Xiamen Dispatch: The Quanzhou garrison's division and brigade recently uncovered a large-scale espionage organization in southern Fujian called the "Sino-Japanese Anti-Communist Fraternal Association." Starting from August 12th, they successively arrested the top ringleader Wu Weixuan, along with key figures such as Lin Maoqi, Liu Wei歪, Lu Jingyuan, Lin Qingjiang, Liu Houshi, Xin Xiaocun, and others, as well as monks Hu Seng, Liao Gongtao, Xu Huilu, Yuyuan, and others. Another espionage organization was also uncovered, and its ringleader Cui Yuqing and over twenty related accomplices were arrested. After interrogation, Wu Weixuan, Lin Maoqi, Liu Wei歪, and Cui Yuqing were sentenced to death on the 20th and immediately executed, while Lu Jingyuan, Zheng Houshi, Lin Qingjiang, Xin Xiaocun, and over twenty others were bound and brought to witness the executions before being returned to prison to await further investigation. It was discovered that Wu hailed from Wu Village in Huian County. He had studied at a private school and attended an agricultural school before serving as an aide to He Jia, the leader of the local militia, and later as a teacher in Oucuo Village. Last year, he was bought off by a certain party and appointed as the chief espionage leader in southern Fujian, recruiting party members from various counties under Quanzhou's jurisdiction. He and Lin Qingjiang, Lin Maoqi, Liu Wei歪, and others organized the so-called "Quanzhou Branch of the Sino-Japanese Anti-Communist Fraternal Association" in Quanzhou. The branch headquarters was located in Lawyer Lu Jingyuan's law office in Zhenfu Lane. The Huian branch was located in Lu's Xianan County office. The general headquarters was in Xiamen, overseen by a certain foreigner. The branches in the various counties under Quanzhou were all under Wu's command, with Liu Wei歪 in charge of finance and Lin Qingjiang and Lin Maoqi as key members. Liu and Lin Qingjiang were originally merchants, while Lin Maoqi was a doctor. Their espionage activities were detected by the brigade headquarters last winter, which dispatched personnel to infiltrate their organization. After seven months, they uncovered its secrets and obtained important documents and confidential letters, providing ample evidence. On the night of August 12th, Lu Jingyuan, Xin Xiaocun, Xu Huilu, Liu Wei歪, Liu Houshi, and Yuyuan were arrested in Quanzhou, and Hu Seng, the director of the Jingjiang Fourth District Economic Minute Office, and Liao Gongsou, the former dispatcher of the First District, were detained. At 5:00 AM on the 13th, a team was dispatched to Huian to arrest Wu. Wu, upon hearing the news, had already fled, so they took Lu to Wu's home in Sanwu Village overnight and finally captured Wu and brought him back to Quanzhou. Wu initially tried to be evasive, but when the seized documents and confidential letters were presented, he finally confessed. He then claimed that even heinous bandits could reform, but there was no way to atone for being a traitor, and that he would only wait to be executed at the Nan Jiao Chang (South Training Ground), which was Quanzhou's execution ground. After Wu was imprisoned in the detention center, all the prisoners cursed him as a traitor. Wu, feeling remorse, begged to be placed in solitary confinement. It was then that he revealed the inner workings of the fake organization and its activities, as well as the espionage agents he had recruited, confessing everything. He even personally wrote a confession that matched the seized documents and confidential letters perfectly. Wu also stated that a certain person from Xiamen had once sent over 400 rounds of ammunition and 200-300 military blankets, which were transported to Quanzhou by sailing ship. When passing Xiutu, they were loaded into kerosene barrels and carried to Badu to resupply Wu Hu (a notorious bandit), who was in charge of military affairs, under the name "Sino-Japanese Anti-Communist Army XXX Team." As for Cui Yuqing, he was from Beiyang and had served as the chief detective in Quanzhou, as well as the leader of the scattered soldiers from other provinces in Quanzhou City who cut queues (braided hairstyles). He was bought off by the enemy to carry out sabotage and riot activities. Evidence was also seized, but the time for its public announcement had not yet arrived. Cui and Wu were from different systems. Wu's was a "static" organization, while Cui's was a "dynamic" one. Wang Bo, the father and a judicial officer in Nanjing County, was originally a lawyer in Quanzhou. Due to his relationship with the Wu case, he was also arrested by the garrison and brought to Quanzhou for questioning. The organizational rules of the so-called anti-communist army under Wu's command are transcribed below:

The so-called Sino-Japanese Anti-Communist Fraternal Association organization has one president and one vice-president each. (1) General Affairs Department, with Documentation Section, Finance Section, and Liaison Section under it; (2) Organization Department, with Youth Section, Agricultural and Industrial Section, and Labor Section under it; (3) Propaganda Department, with Sino-Japanese Cultural Exchange Section, Club Section, Sino-Japanese Anti-Communist Monthly Publication Section, and Employment Referral Section under it; (4) Intelligence Department, with Investigation Section, Information Section, Editing Section, and Distribution Section under it. Each section has one chief and one deputy chief, and two officers (the names of the persons in charge of each department and section are confidential).

### All Sectors Exerting Efforts to Solicit National Salvation Bonds

Communications Sector Continuously Raises Substantial Funds; Overseas Chinese Remit One Million Yuan Yesterday

The General Committee for Soliciting National Salvation Bonds was formally established. Since the start of the solicitation, compatriots at home and abroad have enthusiastically donated and purchased bonds. In addition to the Bank of Communications subscribing six million yuan itself, it has continuously raised substantial funds in recent days. Yesterday, the bank received a total of 550,000 yuan, including 500,000 yuan from the Pacific Insurance Company, 10,000 yuan from Zhu Bingji, 15,000 yuan from Lu Yanji, and 25,000 yuan from He Lingji. Furthermore, the General Committee for Soliciting National Salvation Bonds received remittances totaling one million yuan from overseas Chinese for the purchase of National Salvation Bonds yesterday. The solicitation work is still ongoing, and it is expected that funds will soon be allocated to fully subscribe and increase the strength of resistance and salvation. Details of various situations are recorded as follows:

General Huang Jie Leads Troops in Subscription

President Song of the General Committee for Soliciting National Salvation Bonds received a telegram from General Huang Jie yesterday, stating that the officers and soldiers of his department have already begun resisting the invasion and defending themselves. In addition to being prepared for battle, they have specifically subscribed to 13,000 yuan of National Salvation Bonds, remitted to the Bank of China in Nanjing for transfer, in order to contribute their modest efforts. It is heard that President Song has telegraphed General Huang in return, deeply commending the spirit of the officers and soldiers of his department for both risking their lives and contributing money.

Native Place Associations Form Solicitation Squads

After the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Citizens Solicitation Corps for National Salvation Bonds, various squads were organized separately in order to conduct widespread solicitation. All native place associations in Shanghai have also resolved that each native place association should establish a squad. As of recently, a quarter of the squads have reported their establishment. In order to urge the early establishment of each squad, the association has specifically announced to each native place association that they must establish a squad as quickly as possible before the 11th of this month, and report the name of the squad leader to the association, so that it can be compiled and requested from the General Committee for Soliciting National Salvation Bonds for appointment, and begin solicitation.

Broadcast and Entertainment - Special Program

The Shanghai Broadcasting Association and the Shanghai Entertainment Association have jointly solicited National Salvation Bonds, and have scheduled a special program to be held from 1:00 PM to 8:00 PM every day starting on the 12th, which will be broadcast by radio stations throughout the city. Starting on the 18th, famous performers will be invited to broadcast and sing national salvation operas. It is heard that the program has been scheduled and will be announced on the 10th.

### The Gas Company Should Not Hastily Resume Operations

Opinions of Support Leaders

The issue of the resumption of operations by the gas company in the concessions has attracted considerable attention and concern from residents both Chinese and foreign. Furthermore, the self-ignition of a gas pipe the other day, which injured pedestrians, although it did not lead to a major disaster, makes it difficult to avoid the recurrence of major tragedies at this time of flying bullets. In order to understand the truth of this issue, the reporter specifically visited responsible persons from various anti-enemy support associations. According to them, gas itself has a strong toxic quality. If the underground gas pipes are destroyed by bombs, the gas will leak, and nearby residents may be poisoned to death. Furthermore, the combustibility of gas is very strong. If the gas pipes are broken by stray bullets, nearby houses will be immediately burned. Moreover, the explosive force of gas is extremely strong. If the coal storage furnace is hit by artillery shells, the tragedy of a major explosion will inevitably be expanded. It is hoped that the company authorities will consider the safety of millions of citizens and not hastily resume operations. It is further hoped that for the sake of their own safety, they will use it less for the time being.
