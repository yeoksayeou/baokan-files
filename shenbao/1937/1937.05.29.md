Current Affairs Commentary

### Egypt Joins the League of Nations

— Hua

The most important event at this session of the League of Nations Assembly is Egypt's joining the League of Nations. We in China should feel the greatest "sympathy and interest" because Egypt and China are both ancient civilized countries in the world and both are nations that have been striving for independence and liberation in recent years. On the path of national liberation struggles, we seem to be one step ahead of Egypt, but it is also clear that we are both still in the middle of the journey. Now, with Egypt's joining the League of Nations, we have one more friendly army to assist us in this international peace organization, which we should wholeheartedly welcome.

Dr. Gu Weijun, China's ambassador to France, said well in his speech at this conference: "Egypt's success in Geneva is no less than the satisfactory result of the Montreux Conference. Because on the one hand, it is enough to show the increasing expansion of international justice, and on the other hand, it is really due to the greatness of the Egyptian nation, not only because of its ancient culture but also because it has a youthful and enterprising spirit." This last sentence contains the deepest meaning. We should not only encourage our Egyptian friends with it, but also encourage ourselves. Since the 1880s, Egypt has been under British rule. After the European War, it勉强struggled for a semi-independent status, but the military and political power was entirely in the hands of the British, which was nominal. Egypt's appearance on the world map has never had an independent mark, but the national movement after the war was surging, and the Egyptian people's awareness has had a fierce development. The most notable example is that during the Italian army's invasion of East Africa at the end of 1935, the oppressed nations in the Near East hated the unreasonable barbarity of the imperialist aggressors and rose up to resist together. The Egyptians felt that their freedom was restricted and their constitution was stripped away. Students and workers led the way to demand complete independence. They used bricks and bamboo sticks to strike from school and the market, confronting the foreign-controlled military and police. After such a bloody struggle, there was the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement in August 1936, withdrawing part of the British garrison in Egypt, and the Montreux Conference last month, deciding to abolish the consular jurisdiction of foreigners in Egypt. Now Egypt has officially joined the international community as an independent country. Such progress on the path of national liberation is by no means accidental. Mr. Gu, our representative, called it due to "the spirit of youthful enterprise," which is the most accurate comment.

Mr. Gu mentioned in his speech two missions of the League of Nations: one is the public interest and humanity, to promote cooperation among nations, and the other is to achieve world peace. These two missions, because there are more new member states cooperating, are of course easier to realize. What is particularly important is that in recent years, those who have joined the League of Nations are either small and weak nations that have struggled for a long time, or emerging countries that advocate peace, such as Turkey and Iraq, which joined in 1932, the Soviet Union, Afghanistan, and Ecuador, which joined in 1934, and this year Egypt also joined the League of Nations following Turkey's introduction. The League of Nations was originally an abstract organization, but its actual role is determined by the member states that make it up. Now, on the one hand, several militaristic countries have withdrawn from the alliance, and on the other hand, emerging national states and peace forces are constantly joining. From such a development, the foundation of the League of Nations is becoming broader and its function is becoming more complete, which has a very important effect on the future of international cooperation and world peace.

### British New Prime Minister Chamberlain

### Retiring Prime Minister Baldwin

### Chamberlain's Brief Biography

Neville Chamberlain was born in Birmingham in 1869. His father, Joseph Chamberlain, was one of the leaders of the Conservative Party in the early 20th century, famous for advocating imperial self-sufficiency and imperial mutual preferential tax rates. Former British Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain is Neville's half-brother. Two generations have been in politics, and the Chamberlain family can be described as a family of officials. Neville read in his hometown of Birmingham in his youth, and then studied at Cambridge, Bristol, and Oxford Universities. He graduated from Oxford University with a doctorate in law. During the European War, he served as a member of the Central Supervisory Committee for the Liquor Trade and the Mayor of Birmingham. In 1918, he was elected as a member of the House of Commons, and from 1922 to 1923, he joined the government as Postmaster General. In 1923, he served as Minister of Health, and was later transferred to Chancellor. He served as Minister of Health again until 1929. When the current Privy Counselor MacDonald organized the National Cabinet in 1931, he appointed Neville as Chancellor and remains in that position today. Neville is very committed to his father's legacy, and strongly advocates that all parts of the empire should mutually promote trade. In terms of domestic policy, he is a progressive Conservative. In his more than ten years in politics, he has never made any sensational moves, and he is truly a mature and prudent first-class politician. His hometown of Birmingham is the center of British heavy industry and the birthplace of conservatism. He grew up there, and he has been deeply influenced by it. In terms of trade, Britain has always adopted free trade, and later changed to protectionism, which is largely due to Neville's efforts. Also, after Neville served as Chancellor for a long time, Britain devalued its currency. He worked tirelessly to improve finances and finally succeeded. The increase in income tax rates, the reorganization of war bonds, and most notably, the British economic recovery were also based on Neville's fiscal policies. Neville has submitted a total of six budget proposals during his tenure as Chancellor, and the one he submitted last year advocated levying an additional profit tax on industrial profits to raise funds for military spending, which is its special feature. Neville has a modest and courteous nature. When he speaks, his words are clear and he does not seek to move the audience. After he succeeds as Prime Minister, it will not be easy to raise defense funds, and his responsibilities will be extremely difficult, but he is rich in political courage and should be able to succeed.

### British Future Foreign Policy

Baldwin's Past Achievements; British Newspapers Praise Him

[London] Sir Hall will be transferred to the Home Secretary, and political circles here believe that he will have more power in the new cabinet because he is a good friend of Chamberlain. Political figures said that Chamberlain and Hall take a skeptical attitude towards the League of Nations, and they both oppose Britain taking any responsibility in Eastern Europe. Therefore, Hall's appointment indicates that the new Prime Minister will adopt an independent and active foreign policy. (28th National Sea Telegram)

[Berlin] German newspapers believe that the reorganization of the British cabinet does not indicate a change in policy. The change of British Prime Minister is also similar to the change of leader in an authoritarian government, because Britain is a cabinet dictatorship system, but Britain adopts a democratic approach and is its own political principle for the British people. (28th National Sea Telegram)

[London] Regarding Prime Minister Baldwin's retirement, all newspapers published comments in large lengths. Among them, The Times best expresses general opinion. It is said that Mr. Baldwin embodies the best instincts of the British nation and is an outstanding figure. Although there are mistakes in politics, especially in diplomacy, this is because typical British figures are inevitably not interested enough in diplomatic events, which makes it so, but his ability to lead the group is beyond the reach of his colleagues and former Prime Ministers and cannot be buried.

### British Empire Conference

The situation regarding trade issues was once tense, but the declaration announced by the Minister of Commerce Rensiman today has eased the situation. It is said that the South African delegation raised the gold issue at the meeting and strongly advocated that it should be controlled by currency to create commercial stability. This has not yet been formally confirmed, but it is generally believed that the gold issue will be transferred to the Economic Committee for discussion by experts. Furthermore, the chief representatives of the delegations held their sixth meeting today, with Prime Minister Baldwin presiding for the last time before his resignation, and decided to invite representatives from Southern Rhodesia and Burma to join the Military Needs and Food Committee established on Monday this week. Then, the Minister of Commerce Rensiman began to discuss Imperial trade issues. Speakers included Canadian Finance Minister Dunning, Australian Prime Minister Burns, New Zealand Finance Minister Nash, South African Finance Minister Harvinger, and Indian representative Chafro Lahang, etc. The main representatives of the delegations will meet again next Monday, when Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore will raise the issue of colonies and governing areas. On Tuesday, the discussion of diplomatic issues will continue, when Foreign Secretary Eden will return to England from Geneva and continue to report everything. Furthermore, the Imperial Conference issued two news items this afternoon. One stated that the Economic Issues Committee convened its second meeting this afternoon, passed the committee's report to the conference, and discussed the possibility of economic cooperation between empires. The other stated that the Shipping Committee held its third meeting and continued to discuss the commercial competition between the United Kingdom and the United States in the Tasman Sea near Australia, and it was scheduled to meet again on Sunday.

### Tensions High in League of Nations Administrative Council's Private Meeting Lounge

[Geneva] The League of Nations Administrative Council is scheduled to hold a private meeting at 5:00 PM this afternoon, followed by a public meeting. The atmosphere in the League's lounge is tense, fearing that the Spanish representative, Vayo, will deliver a passionate speech during the public meeting, condemning Italian intervention in the Spanish Civil War and appealing to the League for intervention. The Spanish representative will also indirectly attack Germany for participating in the destruction of Guernica, the ancient Basque capital, resulting in the deaths of 800 Spanish civilians. Diplomats from various countries believe that such a public speech will provoke strong reactions from Italy and Germany and undermine the efforts of Britain and France to promote the withdrawal of foreign volunteers. Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov is also reportedly preparing to speak out against Germany's bombing of civilians. This uneasy situation depends on how the Administrative Council arranges things in advance during the private meeting. (28th, National Dispatch)

### League of Nations Council Discusses Locarno Issue

Britain, France, and Belgium Clarify Positions; Suppression of International Terrorism; Special Meeting Scheduled for Discussion

[Geneva] The League of Nations Administrative Council continued its public meeting this afternoon, focusing primarily on the issue of the new Locarno Pact. French Foreign Minister Delbos, British Foreign Secretary Eden, and Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak each presented their country's position after the joint declaration issued by Britain and France on May 24, regarding Belgium's international status.

Delbos first presented a formal report to the Administrative Council on the content of the joint British-French declaration, stating, "The French government is determined to continue its efforts, despite any difficulties, to conclude a new Locarno Pact. However, France will never forget the close link between the security of Western Europe and the general security of Europe. This has always been France's position, and I must reiterate it. France considers the future Locarno Pacts as a contribution to the consolidation of general peace and hopes to expand its scope to become a pan-European international consultation. France will certainly participate in such consultations."

British Foreign Secretary Eden then repeatedly stated, "The United Kingdom hopes that the negotiations between Britain, Belgium, and France will achieve satisfactory results and prepare for future, broader negotiations. The resolution of the general situation in Europe is what the United Kingdom earnestly desires. The British government is determined to work towards this goal."

Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak then spoke, first expressing Belgium's "warm gratitude to Britain and France for the joint declaration issued on May 24, which relieved Belgium of its obligations as a guarantor under the Locarno Pact. Belgium is relieved of its guarantor obligations but remains guaranteed by Britain and France. This guarantee is based on the definition of this country's foreign policy, which includes two important declarations. First, Belgium is determined to use all its military strength to defend its borders and prevent any aggression or attack. It will also ensure that no other country uses Belgian territory as a naval, land, or air base to launch aggression against a third country. Therefore, Belgium has decided to organize a fully effective self-defense force. Second, Belgium will continue to uphold the League of Nations Covenant and all obligations arising from the Covenant. As for the joint British-French declaration, it is a step towards drafting a future Western European pact. The Belgian government shares the same view as Britain and France."

Finally, the Chairman of the Administrative Council, Ecuadorian representative Quevedo, declared that the issue should be postponed for further discussion at the next meeting of the Administrative Council. (Central News Agency, 27th, Havas Dispatch)

[Geneva] Before discussing the new Locarno Pact issue at today's regular meeting, the League of Nations Administrative Council reviewed the report submitted by the "Committee of Experts on the Suppression of Terrorism."

It is estimated that Schacht hopes to reduce the interest rate on the Dawes loan from 7% to 5.5% and the interest rate on the Young loan from 5.5% to 4.5%. If so, Germany could save approximately 30 million francs in annual interest payments. The issue was discussed during today's meeting between Schacht and Auriol. It is expected that a final decision will be made after Schacht's talks with Prime Minister Blum tomorrow. (Central News Agency, 27th, Havas Dispatch)

### Schacht's Speech on Franco-German Relations

Says Germany Lacks Raw Materials; Desires Cooperation Between the Two Countries

[Paris] German Minister of Economics Dr. Schacht attended a banquet held by the German Chamber of Commerce in Paris tonight. After the banquet, he delivered a speech providing a general overview of Germany's economic situation, stating that Germany lacks various raw materials except for coal. Cash and foreign exchange are especially scarce. To obtain cash and foreign exchange to purchase raw materials, Germany must export a large amount of goods. However, in recent years, our experience has shown that it has become increasingly difficult to export German goods. We are truly saddened by this. Therefore, we must rely on the genius of our inventors, technicians, and workers to manufacture various raw materials ourselves. The true meaning of our four-year plan currently underway lies in this. In short, the various measures taken by Germany in recent years are due to the need to ensure the survival of the German people and the current world economic situation. "

Schacht then stated that Germany's raw material problem could be partially resolved through Franco-German trade negotiations. Regarding trade negotiations, France and Germany have worked diligently in recent weeks to find a basis for mutual trade, which is gratifying. "We are prepared to sell German-produced coal to any country. France's coal, on the other hand, is purchased freely from abroad without restrictions. France possesses a wide variety of other raw materials, including those produced in its colonies. I sincerely hope that the result of Franco-German trade negotiations will enable Germany to share in France's rich reserves of raw materials."

Finally, Schacht praised the International Exposition in Paris, saying it was extremely magnificent and beautiful. "Since France has achieved great success in the Exposition, I am confident that it will do so in other areas as well." (Central News Agency, 27th, Havas Dispatch)

### Death of Prominent Austrian Psychologist Alfred Adler

Whether he was the greatest psychologist will be determined by future generations. (Central News Agency, 28th, Reuters Dispatch)

### Japanese Seiyukai and Minseito Parties Hold Joint Anti-Cabinet Rally

Pass Declaration Accusing Government of Trampling on Constitutionalism; Right-Wing Groups Also Hold Rally on the Same Day

[Tokyo] The Seiyukai and Minseito parties held a joint anti-cabinet rally at 2:00 PM today. Participants included members of the House of Representatives and the House of Peers from both parties, as well as leaders of the parties' regional branches nationwide, totaling over 500 people. A joint declaration was passed, accusing the Hayashi cabinet of trampling on Japan's 50-year-old constitutionalism and demanding the cabinet's resignation to facilitate the formation of a cabinet representing national unity. The intensity of today's anti-government sentiment among the political parties is the first since the three parties jointly overthrew the Kiyoura government of military bureaucrats in 1924. Following today's meeting and the issuance of a joint declaration, it is beyond doubt that the two parties will continue to cooperate and submit a motion of no confidence against the government in the upcoming special session of the Diet. Furthermore, the political struggle will intensify due to the rallies held by over a dozen right-wing groups tonight. The right-wing groups passed radical resolutions, ㊀ attacking the established political parties, the Social Democratic Party, and the Shin-proletarian Party, and ㊁ supporting the Hayashi cabinet. However, according to general observations, unless the right-wing groups are based on the working class and peasants and the current election law is fundamentally revised, the pronouncements and temporary cooperation of the right-wing groups will have little effect on determining the political situation in Japan.

### Liu Hangchen and Qiu Jia Report on the Actual Situation of the Disaster in Sichuan Province

And the Sichuan authorities handle relief measures; rumors amidst the disaster have already been eliminated in the past ten days.

Nanjing dispatch: Liu Hangchen, Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Finance, and Qiu Jia, Director of the Sichuan Provincial Government's Beijing Office, hosted a press conference at the Central Hotel at 2:00 PM on the 28th, reporting on the actual situation of the disaster in Sichuan Province, relief measures, and rumors amidst the disaster, and distributed printed reports. The main points are as follows:

(A) The Actual Situation of the Disaster and Relief Measures

(1) The Actual Situation of the Disaster: Sichuan Province experienced a drought last autumn, affecting more than 30 counties. The central government issued 1 million in Tongwu public bonds, which were cashed for 620,000 yuan. The provincial government added 380,000 yuan to make a total of 1 million yuan, which was handed over to the Sichuan Relief Committee for distribution. A Drought Disaster Relief Committee for Civilian Food was also established to raise 1 million yuan in equalization funds to purchase rice from outside the province and transport it to Sichuan for equalization. Subsequently, another winter drought occurred, with the counties experiencing two to three months without a drop of rain. Since the beginning of spring, the severe drought has intensified, and the spring harvest is only about 40-50% of the average. More than 100 counties in the affected area have not received rain for a long time, the fields are cracked and cannot be sown, prices are high, there is a food shortage, and people are restless. More than 10 million disaster victims are displaced. The strong rob food, acting like bandits, while the kind eat grass roots, tree bark, and the so-called "Guanyin rice" (white clay) to eke out a living. The severity and extent of the disaster are unprecedented in a hundred years. In total, out of 151 counties in Sichuan, more than 140 counties have been affected. According to investigations by the Provincial Relief Committee and the Provincial Government, there are 16 severely affected counties, 46 moderately affected counties, and 68 lightly affected counties. According to reports from various counties, the total number of disaster victims is more than 30 million, and according to investigations by various charitable organizations, it is also more than 10 million.

(2) Relief Measures for the Disaster: Since last winter, the Sichuan Provincial Government, recognizing the approaching disaster due to the winter drought, has formulated relief measures in two categories: active and passive. (a) Passive measures: 1. Reduction and Exemption of Land Tax: Since the winter drought occurred last winter, the counties were severely affected. The provincial government verified and ordered the exemption of more than 1.3 million yuan in arrears from 68 counties in southeastern Sichuan. Subsequently, the provincial government reviewed the severity of the disaster in each county and reduced taxes by more than 4 million yuan. The total amount of land tax reduced and exempted is approximately 6 million yuan. 2. Postponement of Land Tax: This year's spring drought intensified, and there was no prospect of sowing. The provincial government, understanding the disaster situation, ordered the postponement of land tax collection. Except for the 14 counties in western Sichuan with irrigation from weirs, all land taxes in Sichuan Province will be postponed for four months from May 1st to the end of August this year. The amount of land tax not collected due to this postponement is estimated to be more than 16 million yuan. (b) Active measures: 1. Equalization: Since November of last year, when the drought persisted, the Civilian Food Relief Committee continued to purchase and transport grain to Sichuan for equalization. Due to the expanded disaster area, the funds were insufficient. The committee also consulted with the Bank of China and the Chongqing financial community to raise an additional 3 million yuan in funds. The total amount of equalization funds is now 9 million yuan. 2. Emergency Relief: The total amount of emergency relief funds is 1 million yuan, which will be borne by the central government and the Sichuan Provincial Government. The 1 million in public bonds allocated by the central government is equivalent to more than 714,000 yuan and was not remitted to the Sichuan Relief Committee for verification and receipt until the 10th of this month. The 1 million yuan committed by the Sichuan Provincial Government was originally intended to be allocated by pledging 2 million in disaster relief public bonds. However, after repeated consultations with the central government, the Executive Yuan only recently approved this item. Furthermore, the province had already announced the postponement of land tax collection and could only borrow from the Chongqing banking community. Agreement has been reached, and it is expected that the full amount can be allocated to the Provincial Relief Committee by the end of this month. 3. Work Relief: Since there are more than 10 million disaster victims in Sichuan, and emergency relief is only a temporary measure to stabilize the people's hearts, work relief is being implemented in addition to emergency relief. With the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway underway, various construction projects in the province are also being actively carried out. Work relief is currently the most urgent and economical method. The estimated amount for work relief is 4.8 million yuan, and the Sichuan Provincial Government will allocate 600,000 yuan per month starting from April. 4. Agricultural Loans: The Sichuan Provincial Cooperation Committee has long been established, and rural cooperation has been implemented in more than 30 counties. During the disaster, the provincial government paid special attention to agricultural loans and ordered the committee to increase its efforts. After receiving the order, the committee had established cooperation in more than 80 counties by the end of April, and together with those already underway, a total of 118 counties had established rural cooperative financial institutions. The funds for the rural cooperative financial institutions reached 3 million yuan this year, and it is planned to pledge the disaster relief public bonds. In addition to emergency relief, there will be at least 1 million yuan, plus 12 million yuan borrowed from the banking community, to be used for agricultural loans. The purpose of agricultural loans is to enable rural areas to preserve their seeds for cultivation and to enable them to carry out work such as repairing weirs and building ponds, which has the effect of work relief and can prevent future droughts. If there is still a need after the aforementioned funds and loans have been disbursed, the Agricultural and Commercial Bank of China will be asked for assistance.

(3) Hopes for All Parties: The disaster situation in Sichuan is so severe that the above-mentioned passive and active relief measures, amounting to nearly 40 million yuan, may still be insufficient to meet the needs due to the large number of disaster victims. It is hoped that compatriots across the country, with their compassion for the hungry and drowning, will actively donate and provide relief in various ways. One more yuan raised means one more life saved. At this critical juncture, we rely on collective wisdom and efforts to work together for relief. On behalf of the millions of disaster victims, we bow our heads in gratitude.

(B) Rumors Amidst the Disaster

(1) The Occurrence of Rumors: Rumors began to circulate in Sichuan two months ago. At that time, Chairman Liu believed that Sichuan was an important location, and that malicious people spreading rumors would create disturbances, which would be detrimental to the overall situation. He specially dispatched Secretary-General Deng and others to Beijing, accompanied by Deputy Director He of the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission, to pay respects to the central authorities and make representations. Subsequently, the central government issued instructions. Secretary-General Deng returned to Chengdu to report back, believing that everything could be calmed down. However, when Director Liu followed orders to withdraw the troops stationed in eastern Sichuan, malicious people further incited rumors, claiming it was a military action, and the rumors intensified.

(2) Chairman Liu's Attitude: Sichuan has been in turmoil for more than 20 years. Since the unification was completed in the 23rd year of the Republic of China and the Red Bandits were driven out, social order has been stable, and the people have lived in peace and prosperity. The entire country considers Sichuan as the rear guard of the nation. Since the Northern Expedition, Chairman Liu has been determined to support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and Chairman Chiang has also placed great trust and high expectations on Chairman Liu. This spirit of sincere unity is a great blessing for the future of the country. Therefore, Chairman Liu has remained extremely calm regarding the current rumors, seeking instructions from the central government and obeying the leader, only seeking what is beneficial to the nation and the local society, and not considering anything else.

(3) The Process of My Coming to Beijing to Discuss Sichuan Affairs: Chairman Liu, having adopted the above-mentioned attitude towards the current rumors, and listening to the central government, specially dispatched me to Beijing to pay respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the central authorities to seek instructions on everything. After arriving in Beijing, I have successively paid respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the responsible officials of the central military and political authorities to make earnest representations. I have also received earnest instructions from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, as well as sincere instructions from Secretary-General Zhang of the Central Political Council and Minister He of the Ministry of Military Affairs. These have all been telegraphed to Chairman Liu. Chairman Liu has fully accepted the military reorganization plan for fundamentally reorganizing Sichuan affairs. The aimless rumors that have been circulating for the past ten days have been swept away. This is something that can be reported to you with comfort.

As for Sichuan's financial situation, land tax, deed tax, and opium suppression have always been the focus of attention from outsiders. The annual land tax is 26 million yuan, which is included in the budget and has been reviewed and approved by the Chairman through the Military Affairs Commission. Now, due to the drought, it has been reduced, exempted, and postponed as described above. Outsiders, unaware of the facts, still spread rumors that the Sichuan Provincial Government is still collecting taxes, which is a misunderstanding. I have already made a statement on the issue of deed exchange and opium suppression, so I will not repeat it here. As for the emergency relief funds of more than 714,000 yuan allocated by the central government, there is a misunderstanding that the Sichuan Provincial Government has diverted the funds. Yesterday's newspaper reported on the Ministry of Finance's report to the Executive Yuan, which described in detail the delay in issuing relief funds. The truth about whether the Sichuan Provincial Government diverted relief funds is not difficult to see.

### The Japanese Consul in Guangzhou Negotiates with the Guangdong Authorities Regarding the Shantou Incident

Diao Zuoqian Goes to Shantou to Conduct a Thorough Investigation; Negotiations Will Be Handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

Guangzhou dispatch: In the case of Japanese nationals in Shantou assaulting local police officers, the Japanese, knowing that they are in the wrong, are making a big fuss about it, mobilizing Japanese warships to Shantou and making unreasonable demands on us. This case is essentially of a local nature, but the Japanese Consul in Guangzhou, Nakamura Toyoichi, has been trying to meet with the Guangdong provincial authorities for days, nagging about it. The provincial authorities believe that the Shantou case is still under investigation and is a diplomatic matter, so the administrative head is not in a position to handle it. However, Nakamura still insisted on seeing him. At 11:00 AM on the 26th, he went to the provincial government again. Ouyang Ju, Secretary-General of the provincial government, came out to meet him. Nakamura was not clear about the details of the case and made many demands. Ouyang replied that after the truth of the investigation, the local officials of both sides would seek a solution based on the principle of fairness. Currently, the provincial government has sent a letter to Diao Zuoqian, Special Commissioner of Foreign Affairs for Guangdong and Guangxi, asking him to go to Shantou to conduct a thorough investigation. In the future, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will negotiate with Japanese diplomats. At this point, Nakamura left in frustration.

The Changju is concerned that the Japanese warships are continuously sailing to Shantou, and is deeply afraid of misunderstandings with local people. Li Hanhun, the division commander stationed in Chaozhou and Shantou and concurrently the administrative commissioner of the area, has been ordered to return to Chaozhou and Shantou to maintain public order. Li left for Hong Kong by Guangzhou-Kowloon train at about 8:00 AM on the 26th, accompanied by his adjutant and several guards. He will take the Haili ship from Hong Kong to Shantou on the same day. He arrived in Shantou on the 27th and took a car back to the Chaoan Division Headquarters. According to news from the Foreign Affairs Office of Guangdong and Guangxi, Aoyama Kiyoshi, a staff member of the Japanese Consulate in Shantou, violated local laws and regulations and moved into the city without obtaining a permit according to procedures. Local police officers advised him to follow the proper procedures, but he not only refused to comply but also beat the police officers. Our side is now investigating the facts of the assault on the police officers and collecting evidence in order to lodge a protest with the Japanese side. (May 27)

### Taicang

Successful Experiment with Five-Colored Cocoons

Mrs. Hongye, the wife of the owner of the local Pingmin Daily News, loves to study sericulture. When the silkworm eggs hatch into young silkworms, she performs artificial surgery and feeds the silkworms with other kinds of food. After repeated experiments, she finally succeeded this spring. The resulting cocoons are bright and pleasing to the eye with colors such as red, green, yellow, orange, purple, and Fei Lake. The owner of the newspaper will allow people to visit for a week. If you want to plant seeds, please send a letter to register within ten days, and the seeds will be sent by post.

### Suzhou

Commercial Public Buses

In addition to the main roads of Tongmen, Pingtou, and Jinmen, which have been widened in the urban area of Suzhou, the main roads of Shitong, Louqi, Fengxu, Panxiang, and Liumen are also scheduled to start widening on June 1st. There are ten roads in the urban area, and it is expected that they can be completed this winter. Some car dealers have initiated the raising of funds to organize the Suzhou Public Bus Company, preparing to first operate in the three widened main roads and the section from the railway station to Huqiu. After the completion of the ten major highways, the operating routes will be increased.

The Market Price of Fresh Cocoons Soars

The early batch of spring cocoons from the west of Wu County has already entered the market, and the large batch will also enter the market completely within three days. According to statistics from the Sericulture Improvement Area yesterday, there are a total of 50,000 dan of fresh cocoons and 43 cocoon shops. Half of them have already opened, and the rest are scheduled to open on June 1st. The market price of fresh cocoons has soared in recent days. The standard price was originally set at 37 yuan, but the highest price on the 28th has risen to 48 yuan. It is expected that there may be further increases. The newly established cocoon drying machines in Guangfu and Shanrenqiao have already started to be used, and the results are quite satisfactory.

### Zhenjiang

Public Buses Start Operating

Public buses in Zhenjiang City have now started operating. There are three routes: 1. From Zhenjiang Railway Station (Highway Bus Station) via Linyin Road, Zhenjiang Middle School, Huangshan Branch Park, Equestrian Club, West Station (Beijing-Shanghai Road Station) to Jinshan. 2. From Zhenjiang Railway Station via Dashikou, Beigushan, Riverside Park, Baota Road, Baogai Road, Zhenyang Pier, Boxian Park, West Station to Jinshan. 3. From Xibaidu via Qilidian, Pailou, Radio Station, Riverside Park, Dashikou to Zhenjiang Railway Station. Each route has two vehicles, and two more vehicles are added on Sundays. They run eight times a day, round trip. To avoid hindering the business of rickshaws, the fare is 15 cents regardless of distance.

### Ningbo

Fishermen Catch a Large Cuttlefish

A fisherman named Wang from Dongqi Town, District Six, Zhenhai, caught two large cuttlefish, one male and one female, weighing a total of 35 jin, while fishing with nets at sea on the evening of the 26th. This is truly rare.

Water Police Suppress Bandits

Huang Fucai, the bandit leader who occupied Baoshan on the Linhai sea, was surrounded by the Water Police Team together with the Keqiang cruiser for two weeks and fought fiercely several times. The entire gang has been wiped out, and 17 bandits, including the leader, have been captured. All were executed and 22 long and short guns were seized. All the hijacked fishing boats and fishermen were rescued.

### Gleanings from the Yunnan Journey (17)

— Bei Quan (Cups and Plates)

Day 33 (May 7): Departed from Kunming. Thousands of people from all walks of life in Kunming, and 4,500 Boy Scouts, saw us off in the rain. We walked from "Jinbi Park" to "Guchuang Park," a distance of four li. Chairman Long Zhizhou and other officials all arrived at Guchuang Park to see us off. It was raining heavily. We lined up to leave the city, and our clothes were soaked. Of the eighteen vehicles that came with us, No. 1, whose wings were damaged, had been repaired and returned to the team in Kunming. No. 13, the charcoal vehicle, had also been repaired in Panjiang and returned to Kunming. Mr. Long was very interested in the charcoal vehicle and was willing to buy it for 5,000 gold to keep it in Kunming for a trial run. If necessary, he would remove the equipment from this vehicle and copy it in [illegible]. Therefore, Vehicle No. 13 was not included in the return journey. The only thing worth recording about our journey today is our mood in the car, and the memory of six items that I forgot to write down in Kunming, which I will add today:

(1) The bronze statue in Jinbi Park has no inscription, and few people know about it. After asking a receptionist, I learned that it was a statue of Yang Zhenhong, a martyr who died in Vietnam.

(2) Among the hosts of the public banquet from all walks of life, Mr. Yuan Jiagu (Shuwu) was the top scholar in the economic special examination in the late Qing Dynasty. He served as the Zhejiang Provincial Director of Education, implemented new policies, and established schools. He was loved by the people of Zhejiang. Mr. Shen Yuanming and Mr. Wang Wenxuan especially admired Mr. Yuan and went to visit him. Mr. Yuan is over 70 years old, but he is as agile as someone in his 50s. His son is currently the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, and he himself teaches a course on the I Ching, using a scientific approach to explain it, unlike those who study the principles of the I Ching in a rigid manner on the sixty-four hexagrams. Therefore, Mr. Yuan's explanation of the I Ching can be used for life. Mr. Yuan personally wrote a couplet, which Mr. Gao Xiangguo of the Linshi Xinbao considered to be "Xi Leng's old poet Cha Chubai and Nan Yue's elite Li Ciqing" - a clever antithesis. It is a pity that Mr. Gao is from Shanxi. Mr. Shen Yuanming presented two quatrains to Mr. Yuan. Here is one of them: "Riding in a carriage along the West Lake, the elder's hair and eyebrows shine brightly, hundreds of volumes of poems completed in the years of crossing the river, someone is praying for longevity under the flowers." Mr. Yuan replied with a quatrain: "Zhongli dominated the central plains, historical books want to carefully evaluate it. What is Zhejiang like compared to Jiangdong? I want to choose Yaojiang to wash the eight wildernesses." Mr. Yuan missed Mr. Shao Zhang (Bodiaoxiu, a correspondence letter) very much and asked Mr. Wang Wenxuan to send him the Sutra. Mr. Wang Wenxuan agreed to bring it. Mr. Guan Yixian conveyed the message, as Guan is Mr. Shao's son-in-law.

(3) Yunnan chess pieces are very famous. This time, my colleagues bought dozens of them. The price is high, but the value is not high, because good chess players do not choose their pieces, and Yunnan chess pieces are fragile and not durable.

(4) Kunming produces peacocks. Mr. Wei Tingsheng wanted to buy two, but he gave up because he felt that it would be inconvenient to provide food and transportation along the way. Mr. He Sui bought several peacock screens, and Mr. Yu Tongkui's friend gave him a peacock screen, which was used to make three-eyed peacock feathers in the past. It is truly a top-quality item.

(5) French influence in Kunming is very strong. According to outside news, the French always know things first. For example, the day after we arrived, the French Consul Kangdong told Vice-Commander Wu Liande that Japanese Major General Kisato, a military attaché of the Japanese Army, would arrive in Kunming from Vietnam on the 15th of this month and stay for three days before going to Guizhou and Sichuan. On the third day, the Yunnan newspaper published the news, but there was no mention of the dates of stay in Kunming or the route. Also, the staff of the British Consulate in Kunming from Tengyue must travel back and forth once every day.

(6) Li Peitian, the provincial commissioner, recently had to mourn the death of his parents and did not attend banquets. Before the meeting, he gave cinnamon to his close friends. My colleagues agreed to offer condolences on the day of the memorial service.

We arrived in Qujing at 4:00 PM and heard two things:

(1) A Westerner (resembling a Jew) arrived here last week. A military officer asked him for his credentials. He said that he was traveling from India to Japan. When asked about his profession, he first said that he was a journalist, and then said that he was not a journalist. When asked about his nationality, he first said that he was British, and then said that he was American. The military officer believed that his passport route was inconsistent and his words were contradictory, so he arrested him and sent him to the provincial capital.

(2) Some people who moved from Simao and Pu'er to Qujing said that the plague has spread in Pu'er in the past two years, and nearly half of the people have died. Every year, four to five thousand people die. Now, Simao is slightly better, but Pu'er is still severe. That is why entire families have moved to other places to avoid it. Last year, Guangdong Zhongshan University sent seven people to investigate and collect samples on this road, and six of them died. This shows how severe it is. Dr. Wu Liande said that the so-called miasma is actually a type of virulent mosquito that transmits the disease. Mosquitoes suck the blood of patients and then suck the blood of others, spreading the germs, which is 100% effective. Due to the lack of medicine, many people die. If quinine is taken orally for prevention, there is resistance. It is not miasma. In the future, the health administration of Yunnan Province should start with Pu'er and inject preventative agents into households.

Day 34 (May 8): Departed from Qujing in the morning. Commander Hao Mengling also rushed to see us off. Commander Hao had a very good impression of Yunnan and advocated that the military commanders of Yunnan Province use local tin and copper to create several tripods and present them to the Cemetery of Martyrs in Linggu Temple, Nanjing, to commemorate the fallen soldiers. Mr. Chong adopted this suggestion. When we left, Pei Cunfan and other members of the committee sent us to the pass with reluctance. We took a group photo and filmed a short film. Someone said that all walks of life in Kunming had proposed that this trip to Yunnan by the delegation should be commemorated by building a monument in front of the Daguan Pavilion, with 108 people signing their names. Mr. Yuan Jiayu would be asked to write the inscription in the future. I don't know if this can be realized.

We arrived at Pingguan County at noon. Guizhou vehicles had arrived, and some people switched to Guizhou vehicles. The seats in the Guizhou vehicles are comfortable, and the gasoline-powered vehicles are powerful when climbing hills, which is faster than diesel vehicles. It is said that there was a small bandit alert in Panxian a few days ago, and the army is on alert. We arrived at [Illegible] County that night and stayed at Dawei Park. Dawei Temple is surrounded by ancient cedars and pines, and is like Pangu. Before our group passed through, the local government wanted to use this place as a transportation station between Guizhou and Yunnan. They raised funds to repair the temple and build new houses, spending more than 2,000 yuan. In addition, tens of yuan were spent on beautifying the city, cleaning the streets, and repairing the scenery. There were many people along the road in Panxian stopping the cars to lodge complaints (in fact, the situation is the same everywhere, but the military and police monitor and prevent them from coming forward). Mr. Liu Weiling, the representative of the Judicial Yuan, asked the Panxian judge to the temple to inquire about the cases. It was found that there were several cases where people had been detained for two years without being tried, because the county court clerk refused to transfer the cases to the court. There were also complaints against the district chief for dispatching supplies under the pretext of the visiting delegation, to the tune of 600 yuan per district. The lawsuits filed by Hu Jiuyang and others were the most detailed. It turned out that Chu had received the cases and forwarded them to the provincial government, and the particularly important ones were presented to the Executive Yuan. Now that there are so many cases in Panxian, some people said that it might as well hand them over to the Hacha envoy at the same time, which would be more convenient.

Outside of Nandouli, Panxian, there is a Biyun Cave, with the words "Biyun Cave" written on it, and the name "Shuidong" below. A river runs through the cave. The first section of the cave is about 20 meters wide and 20 meters high. The second section is suddenly open and bright, and the four corners of the cave are illuminated by the sun. The width is about twice that of the Yiyan Cave. The third section is a narrow road, and you need to enter with a light. After walking a hundred steps, you reach the fourth section, which is also a large cave. The anterior cave is even taller, and the two places can accommodate more than 3,000 people. The fifth section is a narrow road again. The river is in the cave. We walked across the river seven times, and it was endlessly deep. We turned back to the entrance of the cave. It was found that behind this mountain is "Maokou River," about ten miles away. This water flows out of "Maokou" and enters the Maokou River. There are fish in the cave, which can weigh several pounds. Because they grow in the dark, they cannot see. They have a horn on their head and fine gray-white scales. I saw more than ten soldiers catching them in the cave and getting something. They were of different sizes and tasted like "Guizhou and Guangxi sea dog fish." According to Xu Xiake's Travels, the situation of Biyun Cave is consistent with the description in the book after hundreds of years. Xu did not explore the cave to the end because the torch went out. Now, some of my colleagues have gone two miles deep and saw cliffs and waterfalls that could not be crossed, so they turned back. Xu Xiake's travels between Guiyang and Panxian also follow the same parallel line as our path. At that time, Xu had time to spare, so he saw all the famous attractions nearby. We are just taking a cursory look, ignoring everything. This is also a practical problem. According to Fang Yu Jiyao, the Biyun Cave is also here, but the Shuidong at the entrance below has not yet been named. Commander Chu named it "Qingxi Cave," and the local government will engrave the name. We came from Nanjing and named the cave "Qingxi," aiming to find its origin.

Day 35 (May 9): Departed from Panxian and passed Puan County. The car stopped to add water. I saw a notice posted on the wall by County Magistrate Jian Jiong, proclaiming the order issued by the Guizhou Branch of the Opium Suppression Supervision Office, with eight articles on the temporary purchase of opium certificates. The order informed the verification team members that they should not deliberately make things difficult. The government should protect the purchase of opium that complies with the established regulations. My colleagues picked a few rice flower clusters from the fields nearby and inserted them in the car, which was very lovely. The lower ones have already started to be tapped.

We arrived in An'nan County in the afternoon. The area has long been known for its miasma and leprosy, and no one dared to eat much, and some did not even drink the water. It can be seen that nine out of ten people in the nearby area were wearing mourning clothes, which shows the high mortality rate. It rained again that night, and nothing happened.

Day 36 (May 10): At dawn, we departed from An'nan, passed the Fourteen Bends Ridge, went through Liangshui Camp, and crossed the "Panjiang" Iron Case Bridge. Because we had experience in crossing the bridge, seventeen vehicles crossed in just forty-five minutes. However, when descending from the highlands of Liangshui Camp to the 1,000-meter-high cliff, everyone felt their ears ringing or had hearing problems when they reached the bridge, just like when an airplane lands. This is caused by the drastic change in air pressure due to the sudden descent from a high altitude. The last time we passed here, we also experienced the same feeling when we descended from the chicken field to the bridge. Even Professor Wu Zelin, who is strong in spirit and physique, felt it, which can be confirmed with each other. At 9:00 AM, we arrived at Guanlingchang Town and it suddenly rained. Iron ore is produced nearby, and the county magistrate handed a sample block to Mr. Wu Wuchang to take to the Beijing Industrial Testing Institute for analysis to determine its value. Then, we passed the Huangguoshu Waterfall, which was still there, and was more abundant after the rain. We crossed Guansu Ridge and arrived at the 150-kilometer road sign from Guiyang, where the Hongyai Stele with the characters "22" was unearthed (the Hongyai Stele is written in Miao script, and its outline is described in more detail in Mr. Cao Jingyuan's "Guizhou Miao Customs and Conditions"). After going a little further, we passed Yinzhen Ning County and arrived at Anshun County. We rested briefly in the city, then boarded the car again, passed Pingrang County, Qingzhen County, and arrived in Guiyang. We still stayed at Mao Guangxiang's residence and were assigned to the north and south routes. I decided to take the south route back and was assigned to the second unit. The unit leader was Wang Huishan, a member of the Legislative Yuan. My fellow travelers were Yang Kun, Wang Shoushang, Xu Zhaobian, and Hu Shiquan. We were scheduled to organize the team on the afternoon of the 11th. That night, all the members of the delegation expressed their gratitude to the leaders of the Guizhou provincial military and political circles. Because this tour group traveled a particularly long distance through Guizhou, and traveled on the east, south, west, and north routes, the local supplies and consumption were particularly high. We had to thank you once to show our gratitude for the intention of the whole country.

### National Anti-Smuggling Association Issues Notice to Intensify Work

The National Anti-Smuggling Association of the Republic of China, organized by commercial entities from various regions, issued a notice yesterday to anti-smuggling committees of chambers of commerce in various regions. (Omitted Titles) According to a telegram from the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce Anti-Smuggling Committee, smuggling in North China is shocking the world. Vagrants and traitors are taking advantage of the situation, relying on special protections to expand their influence deep inland, damaging our customs administration, losing our tax revenue, and our domestic goods' sales are being seized by smuggled goods. The impact on local industry and commerce is most significant, causing deep grief. Recently, the newspapers reported on the registration of smuggled goods in Tianjin, with various industries observing and not moving forward, using the excuse that those in the concessions have not registered. The situation is difficult to imagine. Under these severe circumstances, our merchants should adhere to the principles of self-help and national salvation, refusing to purchase or transport smuggled goods. The responsibility of this association is highly important. The association decided to send a telegram to the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce to lead various industries to quickly register and assist the customs in handling the matter. A special telegram was sent to your association, requesting you to inform the anti-smuggling committees of various chambers of commerce to intensify their work, strictly prevent the sale of smuggled goods, and safeguard commerce. Checking the smuggling trend has gradually spread from North China. If precautions are not strictly taken, it will seriously hinder the progress of our country's industry and commerce. Please ensure that your association strengthens its work according to the various points of the anti-smuggling work outline formulated by this association, earnestly implementing it to reverse the tide.

### Shanghai Police Bureau Schedules Second Batch of Opium Addicts for Inspection

Supplementary Registration to be Extended to the End of June; Opium Addicts in Concession Areas Can Also Register

In order to completely eradicate opium addiction, the Shanghai Police Bureau began to conduct inspections of opium addicts who have quit in batches from April 1st of this year. The first batch of more than 1,800 people who were inspected included 73 people who had relapsed and were still addicted. They have been sent to the Garrison Headquarters for punishment in accordance with the law. The second batch of inspections is scheduled to begin on June 1st. The details are as follows:

Addicted After Inspection, Handled According to Law

The Shanghai Police Bureau has been handling opium suppression work since 1935, registering a total of more than 42,000 opium addicts. More than 10,700 people have voluntarily quit. In order to completely eradicate opium addiction, the Opium Suppression Section of the Bureau began to conduct inspections of opium addicts who have quit from April 1st of this year. The first batch of 1,862 people who were designated for inspection has been completed as of yesterday. The results showed that 73 people were still addicted and had relapsed. The Bureau has prepared documents to send them to the Garrison Headquarters for punishment in accordance with military law, and the opium addicts who have not relapsed will still be closely monitored. Inspections will continue to be conducted separately in the future to strengthen the ban on opium.

Scheduled to Begin Second Batch of Inspections

The Opium Suppression Section of the Bureau has completed the first round of inspections of opium addicts who have quit. Now, 2,000 people have been selected from the opium addicts who have quit and the second round of inspections will begin on June 2nd. Notices have been issued to the police stations to send police officers to call them for inspections. In order to complete the inspection work quickly, the Bureau requires that the first batch of 2,000 people be inspected within one month. The third batch of inspections will then begin. The inspections of all opium addicts who have quit will be completed in phases by October of this year. Then, the registered opium addicts will be required to reduce their dosage in accordance with the promulgated laws and regulations and completely eradicate opium addiction by the end of 1940.

Supplementary Registration Extended to End of June

In order to show consideration for opium addicts in the concession areas who have not registered, the Bureau has submitted a request to the Opium Suppression Superintendent of the Military Affairs Commission to conduct supplementary registration. Since registration began on May 1st, more than 3,220 people have registered as of yesterday. The Bureau has issued licenses in accordance with the law to protect them. The original registration period was extended to the end of the month, but because the concession areas are vast, it is feared that it will not be universally known. Therefore, it has been decided to extend the period for another month to the end of June. Opium addicts in the concession areas who want to register only need to contact a Chinese liaison office in the Chinese territory to apply for registration. The license fees are still divided into special licenses and ordinary licenses.

License Renewal Deadline Approaching, Intensified Apprehension

The fourth-term opium addict license renewal was originally scheduled to end on April 30th. To ensure that opium addicts do not lose the opportunity, the deadline has been extended by one month to the end of this month. There are more than 31,500 opium addicts who renewed their licenses in the first term, but only more than 25,000 opium addicts have renewed their licenses this term. In addition to a small number of personnel changes, there are inevitably some who are still procrastinating. In order to maintain the law, the Opium Suppression Section of the Bureau has decided that the Drug Arrest Team will depart on June 2nd to supervise the police officers of each branch bureau to intensify their investigations and arrests. At the same time, the Chenxiangge Police Station has been secretly ordered to pay close attention and severely investigate the small North Gate and Nine Mu Di area, because it is connected to the concession and a general number of unemployed vagrants privately set up opium dens for people to smoke.

### Wireless Telephone Service Between Shanghai and Shantou Opens

### Sichuan Fellow Villagers Association Telegraphed Liu Xiang to Enter Nanjing to Quell Rumors

The Sichuan Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai telegraphed Liu Xiang, Chairman of Sichuan Province, yesterday (28th) to quell rumors. Chairman Liu Fucheng of Chengdu,鑒, There were unexpected rumors in Sichuan and Sichuan people are worried about a big disaster. Fortunately, all parties denied it and people's hearts were at ease. Dare to advance one word, private to national disaster party rich Sichuan disaster. Sichuan people love the country and their hometown, and they are trying to save their lives. Non-forceful unity and peace are not enough to seek survival. I have heard that the central government has fully understood the Sichuan provincial authorities. Your chairman has expressed his sincere support for the central government and accepted the central government's six proposals. From now on, the central and local governments will be able to meet each other frankly. All military and political plans will be solved. Harmony is not very rare, and there will be no more rumors caused by the Association. In addition, our Sichuan is far away in the west and is located on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The people of the country have labeled it as the base for the revival of the Chinese nation. From a political point of view, no matter what happens to the central and local governments, they should take care of this base for national revival, and they should take care of them one by one. Not only should they throw rats but also avoid weapons, and they should love houses and care for crows. With the spirit of working together to overcome difficulties and achieving national unity, what is the reason for the isolation of Min in a month? Even if the whip is out of reach, there may be occasional isolation or secrets that cannot be fully conveyed by non-text messages. Your chairman, as the upper country and the lower place, may go to Nanjing at any time to report on his work in order to ask for instructions in person. Sincerity and trust will immediately solve the isolation of Min. Sichuan is fortunate and the overall situation is fortunate. The telegraph is terrified and waiting for Mingjiao.

### Scheduled Discussion to Participate in the Paris Exposition

It is Imperative and Cannot be Stopped

The Paris International Exposition will be held in France and various countries have been invited to participate. The Association for Participating in the Paris International Exposition has collected items and everything is ready. The procedures for going abroad have not yet been decided. This month, the leader of the delegation, Chu Minyi, led the Beijing-Shanghai tour group to Yunnan, so the matter was not carried out immediately. Various exhibitors are very anxious. Chu returned to Shanghai yesterday morning and specially appointed representatives Guo Xiuzhi, Chen Fengwu, and Wu Boyi to visit him yesterday afternoon accompanied by Wang Zhisheng and present the letter from the organizing committee Wang Xiaoji, Lin Kanghou, and Pan Gongzhan. The original letter stated that they had received telegrams from Gu Ambassador Shaochuan and Xie representative Dongfa stating that they had formally negotiated with the French government and that the French government had given special preferential treatment by allocating a free exhibition room. The party has accepted the exhibition room and it is impossible to report that they will not participate. At the same time, domestic exhibitors are determined to carry through to the end. In recent days, they have petitioned or sent letters of inquiry and strongly suggested that a meeting be held. Considering the difficult situation abroad and the domestic situation, after much consideration, it is better to proceed as before in order to maintain Sino-French relations, maintain international credibility, and satisfy the wishes of the exhibitors. As for the question of insufficient time, according to the Havas news, although the conference has opened, the construction of several national pavilions has not yet been completed. The so-called situation of insufficient preparation is not only in one country. Moreover, the items have been collected and only waiting to be shipped. It is still possible to catch up if we proceed actively at this time. The news that the conference has been postponed for several months has also been heard. If this is true, then it can be arranged more calmly. As for the representative issue, it would be best if Min Gong could go abroad for a trip. Otherwise, another person can be recommended. If you agree with this idea, please transfer it to Wang Dai, Dean of the hospital, and Wei Dai, Secretary-General, to instruct the Ministry of Finance to quickly allocate funds to facilitate the trip. It is reported that Chu strongly agreed to depart as soon as possible and will send a letter to Wang Linpan stating that a meeting will be held on the first day of next month to nominate representatives to leave on the first or second day. The location of the public meeting will be in the Bankers Association and the time will be 4:00 PM.

### Henan Dengfeng Relief Efforts

The China-Foreign Joint Relief Committee and the Chinese Jisheng Society are jointly carrying out emergency relief efforts in Dengfeng, Henan. They have received a telegram from Yang Shan, the director of the two committees, stating that all emergency relief has been released and that a detailed report will be sent later. They are currently carrying out work-for-relief projects in the county, opening a list of projects. Two water ponds in the Chongfu Palace can irrigate more than 100 acres of land. Two water wells in the Zhongyue Temple can irrigate nearly 100 acres of land. A water channel in Shidao Town can irrigate more than 2,000 acres of land. A water channel in Xibaiping can irrigate more than 1,000 acres of land. The Sanxianquan channel can irrigate more than 400 acres of land. The Jinniuquan pond can irrigate 300 acres of land. The Heishan Tan water pond can irrigate 400 acres of land. The Ouchi water channel can irrigate 1,000 acres of land. The earthwork for the above eight water conservancy projects is listed as a major project urgently needed in the county. There are too many poor people living near the city, living in temples and empty spaces, unable to make a living. The relief efforts are not enough, and it has been a long time since the harvest, making it difficult to support them. Considering this reality, the two associations are trying to raise funds to use work as relief, selecting personnel to supervise to ensure that the funds are not wasted and the work is practical. Once the project is completed, it will be announced in detail. However, the project is huge and the funds are small, so it is necessary to plan for the aftermath. They are currently hoping that people of good faith will provide more support.

You requested the collection of medicines to be shipped to Bian for relief, etc. We immediately published notices in newspapers to solicit donations from all walks of life. However, fearing that the effort might be too slow to address the urgent need, we first negotiated with the Xinwei Relief Association to allocate 600 bottles of dysentery powder, 500 bottles of Jiuku water, 1,000 packets of Wushi tea, 1,000 bottles of Jisheng pills, 200 boxes of Wan Jin You, 200 boxes of Zhizun You, and 100 packets each of Bagua Dan, headache powder, Leiji San, Qingling Dan, and Huiying Dan. All were packed into a large wooden box and delivered to the China Express Company for shipment. We have enclosed a bill of lading with this letter for your reference. We hope you will inspect and collect the goods and distribute them to various disaster areas for relief. We also hope that you will issue a receipt and send it to our association for filing by the Xinwei Relief Association."

### Tricycle Company Engine Room Staff Request Improved Treatment

Presenting Five Demands, Asking the China Wheel Association to Negotiate

Recently, shipping rates have risen, the shipping industry has prospered, and the profits of various shipping companies have increased. Crew treatment is being actively improved everywhere. All the engine room staff of the Sanbei, Hongan, and Ningxing tricycle companies believe that with the current extreme development of the shipping industry, the rising cost of goods, and the increasing cost of living, it is also necessary to improve the treatment of the engine room department of the three companies. Therefore, they have specifically put forward five demands, earnestly requesting the China Wheel Association to negotiate on their behalf. It has been learned that the five demands are as follows: 1. Increase treatment. Currently, with the rising cost of goods and the increasing living standards, various companies have raised salaries, but the companies in question still have engine room chiefs earning 120 yuan. According to this salary amount, it is only equivalent to the chief or second engineer of a general company, and its meager amount is evident. Therefore, we sincerely request that the standard mentioned in the "Discussion on Promoting Navigation" by the Navigation Administration Department in the 23rd year of the Republic be followed and that an increase be immediately granted. 2. Abolish the regulation of half-pay for repairs. The company claims that because it has a shipyard, it only pays half-pay during the period of repairing a ship. However, during the repair period, the engine room staff are actually more diligent than usual, and general companies all pay full pay. This unreasonable regulation should be abolished. 3. Increase food allowance. The company's food allowance for senior crew members is not uniform. For example, the pilot is 25 yuan per person, while the engine room staff is only 15 yuan per person, which is different from the regulations of other companies. In most other companies, the food allowance for pilots and engine room staff is the same, without distinction. We request that this be improved. 4. Salaries should be paid for legitimate leave. The company often deducts salaries for crew members taking leave, which is clearly contradictory to the Maritime Law. In the future, the Maritime Law should be strictly followed. 5. Restore the third engineer position. In order to save a small amount of salary, the company has actually filled the position of third engineer, which is stipulated by the Ministry of Communications, with apprentices from the factory. This not only affects the job prospects of those who hold the Ministry of Communications' second engineer certificates but also relates to navigational safety, which is extremely important. It should be restored.

### Zhu Minyi Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning to Discuss His Impressions of the Beijing-Yunnan Highway Tour

Long Yun Sincerely Supports the Central Government; Miao and Yao People Have a Strong Sense of Unity

Central Committee member Zhu Minyi, former head of the Beijing-Yunnan Highway Tour Group, led 100 members back to Nanjing on the 26th to report on the tour to Chairman Wang and others and to handle the affairs of the National Assembly Election General Office. He arrived in Shanghai by car at 7:00 AM yesterday to handle the affairs of the Sino-French National Institute of Technology and returned to Nanjing that night. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed Zhu at the Sino-French Institute of Technology. According to him, he and others returned via the southern route through Guangxi to Hengyang, Hunan, after a total of 49 days. The northern route will arrive in Sichuan within a few days and return to Nanjing after disbanding in Chongqing. They traveled entirely by bus, with a total actual driving time of 106 hours. If ordinary private cars were used, the time could be further shortened. The highways in all provinces are very well-constructed, mostly paved with gravel, and the road surfaces are wide. Generally speaking, Hunan is the most widespread and the best, and Yunnan is also very good, but the distance is not long, only about 3,000 kilometers from the border to Kunming. All the detailed information has been discussed and published in Nanjing. He will also attend the central memorial service next Monday to report. What he wants to say now is that the impressions he gained from this trip are extremely pleasant. He met with various ethnic groups, including the Miao in Hunan, the Yao in Guangxi, and the Yi in Yunnan. They are all physically strong, unlike the weak Han people. They weave their own clothes and grow their own food, and they have a particularly strong sense of unity. It is a pity that they lack education. Miao and Yao children get along with Han children and are not lacking in assimilation, and many marry Han people. Yunnan Chairman Long Yun sincerely supports the central government, and all central government orders, such as implementing the prohibition of foot-binding and training the people, have been very successful. Long also issued a strict order to liberate Yunnan women from the custom of foot-binding. The local situation is also stable in western Yunnan, and there are no bandits in the entire province. The climate is refreshing, and no one in the entire province suffers from tuberculosis. Therefore, Yunnan is truly a natural sanatorium for lung diseases. In terms of production, products such as copper, tin, ham, and marble are world-renowned. Therefore, Yunnan has great prospects. As for the border area between Yunnan and Myanmar, he did not go there because the road was too difficult. The dispute over the boundary between China, England, Yunnan, and Myanmar has now been resolved, and China has recovered a considerable amount of territory.

### China Merchants Bureau Yangtze River Line Adds Six New Ships

Jinjiang Wheel to Launch Next Month

The Shanghai Tianying China Merchants Bureau has recently built a Jinjiang wheel at the Jiangnan shipyard in early spring this year in order to develop Yangtze River navigation. The wheel is planned to run specifically in the area of Hubei, Yichang, Sichuan, and Chongqing. It has now been completed and is scheduled to hold a launching ceremony on the 26th of next month.

The bureau is currently making improvements to the Haiheng wheel that travels between Xiamen and the Philippines to ensure that passengers are satisfied. For example, tea servants who are familiar with the dialects of various southern provinces are hired on board to prevent passengers from feeling inconvenienced due to language barriers. Zhai newspapers and magazines are provided, and wireless broadcasting is installed to entertain passengers.

### Li Jingcong Promotes Gliding

Longhua Factory Adds Two "Gliding Machines" to Be Shipped to Hangzhou for Test Flight Upon Completion

Li Jingcong, General Manager of Eurasia Aviation Company, initiated the promotion of gliding sports in order to promote people's interest in aviation and to exercise their physical and mental strength. He has received sponsorship from party and state leaders and people from all walks of life. According to reporters, in addition to supervising employees in the machine factory attached to the Eurasia Company's large machine ridge at Longhua Airport, Li has manufactured two gliders, which were shipped to the vicinity of Tianping Mountain in Suzhou a month ago for test flights. The results were good, but the surrounding area was narrow, and the lifting and landing could not be done freely. After the test flights, the glider wings were damaged. In addition to being shipped back to Shanghai for repairs, two more gliders were added to the machine factory and are currently being manufactured. They will be completed soon, and it has been decided to ship them to Hangzhou for test flights. The gliding of this glider relies entirely on the control of air and wind power, and the flying field needs to be large, especially close to high mountains. If the test flight results are good in the future, a public performance will be held, and all walks of life will be invited to visit.

### Shanghai West Kang Nai Tuo Road Public Works Bureau Busts Japanese Private Counterfeit Currency Agency

Japanese and Korean People Ko Kusa Junyu and Others Arrested; Machines and Printed Fake Tickets Seized; Principal Offender Hosokawa Surrenders to Japanese Consulate; Chinese Lin Shizhong and Others Detained for Investigation

Since last winter, the police authorities of the Public Concession, based on reports that Japanese and Korean expatriates were secretly organizing a counterfeit currency agency with unscrupulous Chinese in Shanghai to manufacture a large number of banknotes of the Central, China, and Communications Banks, disrupting finance and undermining monetary credibility, ordered a strict investigation. Because these people were adept at the skills of a cunning rabbit with three burrows and moved around constantly, although detectives were sent out in all directions, they never found any trace of them. It was not until the middle of this month that Director Lu Liankui of the General Inspectorate, Detectives Liu Shaokui, Feng Zhiming, Zhu Shoulang, and Detectives Song Bingzheng and Zhou Honglin learned that the counterfeit ticket manufacturing agency was located at No. 61 and No. 63 Changcheng Village, Kang Nai Tuo Road, Shanghai West. Because the area bordered the Chinese boundary, they negotiated a joint arrest method with the Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Police Bureau, and the Japanese Consulate. On the morning of the 27th, Director Lu, along with West Detective Jia Lehua, led a large team of detectives, all armed, and Japanese police officers dispatched by the Japanese Consulate rushed to the location and joined forces with Chinese detectives to strictly surround the private counterfeit ticket agency and its neighboring houses, and then entered to search. At that time, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese male and female criminals living in No. 63 fled in all directions. Some jumped on the roof, some ran to the balcony of the neighboring house, and some hid in dark corners. As a result, they were captured, including Japanese Ko Kusa Junyu, Japanese woman Matsuda Asako, Korean Jeon Woo-soo, Kim Young-geum, Yoon Ji-seop, and Chinese Lin Shizhong from Suzhou, Qian Jinfu from Changzhou, Shen Yifu (also known as Shen Liwu) from Ningbo, and Zhou Yunhe (namely Qiu Yunhe), and other nine people. Two printing machines, one printing machine, six copper plates of one-yuan, five-yuan, and ten-yuan tickets of the Central, China, and Communications Banks, 70 fake five-yuan tickets of the Bank of China, and one paper each of one-yuan, five-yuan, and ten-yuan sample tickets of the three banks were seized. A bag of partially printed ticket paper, 20 pounds of cut paper, 16 cans of various inks, 48 cans of chemical raw materials, two barrels of paint, and multiple photographic equipment, as well as smoking guns and other items, were all taken back to the police station. After questioning, except for the five Japanese and Korean men and women, who were sent to the Japanese Consulate for interrogation, the four men, including Lin, were detained. Although the mastermind of the case, Japanese Hosokawa Genzo, was missed at that time, he surrendered himself to the Japanese Consulate yesterday morning. Han An Jinguk, an accomplice hiding on Pu Shi Road in the French Concession, was also arrested and sent to the Japanese Consulate for investigation yesterday morning. The capture of Lin and others was sent to the First Special Zone District Court yesterday morning by the police station. Judge Fu Lin opened the eighth court for interrogation. First, Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the police station, stated the circumstances of the case, saying that because there were reports that these people had machines hidden in the agency, fearing that they would resist arrest, the detectives were all armed when they went to arrest them to prepare for any unexpected events. There are many items seized, and a separate list is presented for verification. The agency is well-organized and large-scale, and it took a long time to solve the case. In addition to manufacturing fake tickets, there is also communist suspicion. Many photos of world-famous communist figures and communist books are hung in the house. According to Lin Shizhong, the defendant in the case, Hosokawa was the principal offender, and he was hired to print, with a monthly salary of 60 yuan. Qian Jinfu also confessed that he was hired as a tea servant, with a monthly salary of 20 yuan. Because Qian was carrying Shen Yilu's business card, Shen was arrested again. Shen and Zhou Yunhe were both draftsmen for British-American Tobacco Company. Many colors of paint were confiscated from Shen's house. These kinds of paints are not required for their duties, and their relationship with Hosokawa is very deep. They are now being prosecuted for the crime of counterfeiting currency under criminal law, but further investigation is required. A request was made to extend the period by one week, etc. Next, Detective Liu Shaokui reported the process of solving the case, saying that the house was the property of Changcheng Company, rented by Bei Liu, and Tang Jiasheng was the guarantor. However, Liu still does not know the whereabouts. Now, only Tang has been summoned, and Tang will prove the process of guaranteeing the house rental for Liu. Lin Shizhong, the defendant, confessed that he was hired by Hosokawa to print without any mistake. Qian Jinfu confessed that he received Japanese education and served as a teacher in his hometown. Later, due to unemployment, he was hired by Hosokawa as a tea servant. Although he knew that privately manufacturing fake tickets was an illegal act, he was already involved and could not extricate himself, etc. The two defendants, Shen and Zhou, both admitted that they had been friends with Hosokawa in the past and had visited him a few days ago, but denied participating in the work of privately manufacturing fake tickets, and hired lawyers to apply for bail. After passing the interrogation of the judge, it was ordered that the defendants be returned to custody because the case was important, and the hearing would be rescheduled for one week. The Japanese Shanghai Daily wrote that the Public Works Bureau's Special Affairs Section learned that there was a large-scale international paper currency counterfeiting group hiding in the west of the city. At 10:00 AM on the 27th, it joined forces with the Japanese Consul General's Police Department, the Municipal Police Bureau, and the Songhu Garrison Command to rush to No. 61 and No. 63 Kang Nai Tuo Road in seven cars, surrounding and searching. The criminals heard the police and all tried to escape to the roof. Two Japanese men and women, two Koreans, and two Chinese were arrested on the spot. Two printing presses, 26 copper plates, and a large number of counterfeit banknotes were seized. One more Korean was subsequently arrested elsewhere. It is heard that there are still Japanese who have escaped, and they are currently being searched for. It was discovered that the criminals had been known to the Special Affairs Section of the Public Works Bureau three weeks ago, and they deliberately waited for their printing machine to be completed before arresting them. The counterfeit banknotes were the Bank of China's five-yuan and one-corner banknotes, the Central Bank's five-yuan and five-corner banknotes, and the Communications Bank's banknotes, etc. The printing machine can print 1,500 sheets per hour, and 30,000 yuan has already been printed. The arrested Japanese are named Ko Kusa Junyu and his wife, Korean Kim Young-geum, Yamamoto Kazuo, Kim Woo-soo, Matsuda Masako, Korean Yoon Ji-seop, and Chinese Qian Jinfu, Lin Shizhong, and Shen, etc.

### Threatening Letter Thrown Through Door Crack

Chen Longshan Is Excited to Remarry for His Son; A Poor Friend Enumerates Scandals to Extort Money

Chen Longshan, the owner of a Jiangbei smoked paper, oil, wine, and grocery store at the intersection of Caishi Road and Kangdi Road in the French Concession, is 63 years old this year and has a son named Chen Donglin, who is an adult and also helps manage the store. Donglin married his wife in the summer of the year before last. Because of pregnancy to the month suddenly suffered from madness died suddenly. The Chen father and son were accused by their in-laws in court of abuse and injury resulting in death. Because the corpse had been reported to the court at that time to show that he died of illness, the case was finally concluded in the winter of last year after three trials by the Supreme Court. Chen Longshan recently remarried for his son and set the wedding date for the 17th of the previous day. On the evening of the 26th, he invited relatives and friends to the store. At 7:00, when a banquet was being held and a makeup wine was being drunk, Wang Fengshan, a Yangzhou man living at No. 156 Damuqiao Road in Nanshi, 42 years old this year, asked Wang Yishan (41 years old), a Nantong man who set up a fortune-telling stall at the intersection of Caishi Road and Father Du Road, to write a threatening letter. The letter enumerated Chen Longshan's scandal on February 18th of the Republic of China when he had an affair with a woman named Wu Lanzhi and was caught in adultery by her husband, resulting in the woman's suicide, etc. He also entrusted Wang Yiting to send the threatening letter to Chen's store and threw it in through the door crack. Chen Longshan discovered this and drove them out and called the police, and the two Wangs were arrested and taken to the police station. Chen reported the information and the captain sent detectives to investigate. They were sent to the Criminal Court 1 of the Special Court yesterday, where Judge Chen Shuoying interrogated them. The Police Department prosecuted them for the crime of intimidation, and the plaintiff Chen Longshan stated the process of receiving the letter, and claimed that he did not know the defendants. When asked, Wang Fengshan confessed that he had known the plaintiff for many years and that he often gave him old clothes as relief. This time, he planned to return to his hometown and asked him to borrow one yuan for travel expenses, but he refused. He used to have an affair with a woman and caused her to die. Now he is rich and does not recognize poor friends. Knowing that he was getting married, he asked someone to write a letter to scold him. Wang Yiting confessed that Wang Fengshan asked me to write and send it on his behalf, and he led me there, giving me a dime, etc. The court examined the threatening letter and ordered that the debate be opened, and then announced the end, and it was decided that the defendants would be returned to custody on the 31st.

### The Public Works Department's Report on the Accident at Maochang

Ammonia Pipe Defect

The accident that occurred at the Maochang Air Conditioning Company on Huangpu Road last Wednesday has been reported in various newspapers. The Factory Affairs Management Office of the Public Works Department has completed its investigation. According to a report by Ms. Xinde, the director of the office, the direct cause of the accident was a defect in the safety valve of the ammonia pipe. In addition, the sudden hot weather and insufficient water supply led to a possible increase in pressure in the pipe. The ammonia pipe was installed by the company on the bottom floor of the egg factory, but it was not separated from other parts of the factory building, and its location was close to the entrance of the main staircase, which was inappropriate. Furthermore, according to the usual practice, the safety valve of this type of cylinder should be equipped with a vent pipe leading to the open air. The company did not install this type of vent pipe, so the ammonia gas was dispersed in the room, which was extremely dangerous. If the air contains 16 to 2600 percent ammonia gas, there is a possibility of explosion. The open fire basin used by workers was enough to ignite the gas. It was fortunate that an explosion did not occur. According to the regulations on the installation of steam engines and other gas pressure machines promulgated by the Public Works Department in March last year, all boilers, steam pressure machines, and containers of various gases under pressure must be inspected so that the risk of explosion or fire directly or indirectly caused by these machines can be reduced to the greatest extent possible. These regulations came into effect in October last year. According to the regulations, a total of 216 boilers have been registered, but the number of other gas pressure machines that have been inspected is still small.

### The Winner of the First Prize in the Thirty-Fourth Aviation Lottery

The thirty-fourth aviation lottery was drawn on the tenth of this month. The first prize, number 27275, was distributed by the Dayun Company to Dafulai for sale. It is said that the Hengsheng Tobacco and Paper Shop in a town near Songjiang had been doing business with Dafulai Tobacco Merchants. The owner of the shop, Mr. Xu Maolin, came to Shanghai last month to purchase goods. With the remaining change, he bought four aviation lottery tickets and won the first prize. He came to Shanghai yesterday to thank the company. He raised his glass and expressed his happiness. The host and guests rejoiced. It is said that Mr. Xu is willing to donate a large sum of money to relieve the Sichuan disaster. The second prize, number 25690, was distributed by the Dayun Company to Tiancifu for sale. It is said that a dentist surnamed Chen in Hongkou won one ticket, someone from the Post Office Administration won one ticket, and a waiter from a Cantonese restaurant won one ticket. Most of the third and fourth prizes were sold in this city. According to the Dayun Company, people from other places, such as Mr. Li from Renhetang in Zhixi Bridge, Jintan, and Mr. Fang Shuonian from Danyang, have been sending letters to redeem the third and fourth prize money, reaching more than 40 places.

### The Granddaughter-in-Law of the Descendant of the Qing Dynasty's Xian Ding Sues her Husband's Uncles to Divide the Inheritance

The Plaintiff is Stubborn and Difficult to Reconcile; the Judge Advises the Lawyers to Persuade Concessions

Wang Jintang (deceased), a native of Fujian, was an imperial envoy of the Qing Dynasty, wore a yellow jacket bestowed by the emperor, and was the first director of the Telegraph Bureau. He traveled to Jiangsu and settled in Shanghai, accumulating a considerable estate. Decades later, his granddaughter-in-law, Wang Gongshi (who is also elderly), sued her husband's uncle, Wang Zhengshi, the wife of Tingliang, and her uncle, Wang Zhuqi (also known as Tingrui), in the local court to divide the jointly owned inheritance. The main points of the lawsuit are that the plaintiff's deceased father, Tingchu, was the eldest son of his grandfather, Jintang. The second son was Tingliang, the third son was the plaintiff's deceased uncle, Tingzhang, and the fourth son was Tingrui. After Jintang's death, in the seventeenth year of Xianxu, the property was divided, but 30 shares of the Telegraph Bureau's stock were left as a common fund for the ancestral burial ground. If there was a shortage, the four brothers would jointly make up the difference. Later, the stock was sold, and land measuring 10.686 mu (a Chinese unit of land measurement) in the name of Huaiyintang was purchased in the 25th Bao and 25th Tu (administrative divisions), as a burial ground shared by the four families. However, except for the burial grounds of Jintang and his wife, the rest of the land was not used due to superstitious beliefs about geomancy. Such good land was abandoned. However, the defendant, Wang Zhuqi, was cunning and wealthy, and Wang Zhengshi, being old, held the land deeds. Although neither of them wanted to use the land for burial, they refused to divide it. The plaintiff had repeatedly requested a division, and Wang Songshi, the daughter-in-law of the third house, Tingzhang, had already agreed, but Wang Zhengshi and Wang Zhuqi did not agree. Therefore, they requested that one-fourth of the land be allocated to the plaintiff and others. Yesterday, the case was heard by Judge Yuan. The plaintiff's agent and lawyer Cai Dingnv stated the main points of the lawsuit and requested that the 10.043 mu of land currently measured be divided into four parts, excluding about one mu for the ancestral hall and cemetery. At this point, the plaintiff, Wang Gongshi, testified that she was 56 years old, her husband had passed away 18 years ago, and her son had also died, leaving only a grandson who was only 12 years old. Her father-in-law, Tingchu, had also died 13 years ago. Her grandfather had four sons, and the property was jointly owned, as stated in the division document. Currently, there are eight coffins that have not been buried, and their livelihood is extremely difficult, so she is suing for a division of the property. The defendant did not appear and was represented by lawyer Zhu Zhizhong, who stated that money could be given for the burial of the coffins, and that since they were of the same family, it would be appropriate to discuss and provide assistance for their financial difficulties. However, the plaintiff was stubborn and difficult to reconcile. The judge advised the lawyers to persuade the defendants to make concessions so that the case could be resolved as soon as possible. The case was adjourned for another hearing.

### The Court Intensifies the Search for the Suspect in the Dismembered Young Girl Case

The Prosecutor Summons Detectives for Questioning; Instructs on Tactics to Solve the Case Soon

Starting on May 18th, for five or six days, dismembered body parts of a young girl were found in the Suzhou Creek near the Fujian Road Bridge. The body parts found included the lower torso, head, two hands, and two feet. The Water Police pieced together the body parts, but the upper half of the torso above the breasts was missing. The case was reported to the local court, which ordered an examination and collection of the body parts, pending the discovery of the missing torso to complete the body. However, it has not been found. This case is being handled by Court Prosecutor Zhong Chao.

### A Primary School Teacher, Vain and Self-Admiring, Steals Colleagues' Clothes and Takes Legal Tender for a Trip to Suzhou and Hangzhou

His Pleasure Turns to Weariness, Remorse, and an Attempted Suicide; Rescued, Sent to Shanghai for Interrogation and Punishment

Wei Xingmin, a 27-year-old teacher from Qingjiang at Boxi Primary School, No. 114 Pubuishi Road in the French Concession, is usually vain and self-admiring and quite fond of fashion. However, because his salary as a teacher is meager, he is often strapped for cash. As spring turns to summer and the weather warms, Wei was seized with the desire to take a short trip. However, since he was penniless, he had a dishonest idea. On the eighth of this month, when his colleagues Liu Zhongyin (27 years old, from Sichuan), the director of academic affairs, and teachers Guo Chufang (26 years old, from Sichuan) and Meng Kan (22 years old, from Sichuan) were out, he sneaked into their rooms and stole Western-style clothes, bedding, and legal tender worth 223 yuan. He then asked the school for leave to travel to Hangzhou. After Wei left, Liu and others discovered the theft and reported it to the French police, asking them to investigate. After traveling to Hangzhou, Wei went to Suzhou to visit the Tiger Hill and other scenic spots. By the time he finished sightseeing, his money was also exhausted. In his hotel room, he thought about what he had done, which was a loss of personal integrity, and felt ashamed to face anyone. Under this stimulus, he attempted suicide by taking poison. The hotel discovered this and sent him to the Tao Shiliang Hospital outside the Xuanmen. Fortunately, the poisoning was mild, and he was spared from death. Wei then sent a letter to Boxi Primary School and reported to the French police. The Suzhou police were notified to detain Wei, and detective Liu Jinrong went to Suzhou to bring Wei back to Shanghai. Yesterday, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, where he was interrogated by Judge Qiu Huanying. The Police Department prosecuted him for theft. The plaintiffs also came to court to recount the circumstances of the theft. Wei Xingmin confessed to the crime and said that he had committed this illegal act because he was stimulated and had a nervous breakdown. The court verified the confession and sentenced the defendant to four months in prison. Wei heard the sentence and said to the court that his reputation was ruined by the sentence and that he would commit suicide again after being released from prison. The judge advised him that he was still young and could work hard after being released from prison to correct his mistakes and restore his reputation. The bailiff then took the defendant down and sent him to the detention center for custody.

It weighs over 1,200 pounds and is 7 feet long. The rear of the cannon body has two handles. According to the manufacturing date engraved on the cannon, it was made in 1820 AD, which is 117 years old.

### Yu Lichen to be Buried Tomorrow in the Chinese Cemetery

Ms. Yu Lichen, a female student who had studied in Japan for three years, returned to China but suffered a relapse of lung disease and fell into mental disorder, eventually committing suicide on the 21st of this month. Her sister, Ms. Yu Peishan (also known as Li Mingjian), has selected a burial site in the Chinese Cemetery, and the funeral will be held at 10 a.m. on the 31st of May from the Chinese Funeral Home on Haige Road. Yu was a native of Hexian County, Guangxi, and was intelligent and extremely self-disciplined. Through work-study and self-study, she enrolled in middle school for two years and then was admitted to the Beiping Women's Normal University. Her academic performance and conduct were respected by teachers and friends throughout the school. Later, she served as the editor of "Women and Family" in the Tianjin Dagongbao. Subsequently, seeking further education, she studied in Japan and was admitted to the graduate school of Waseda University, majoring in economics. In her spare time, she often wrote articles, and her theories were very popular with readers. Unfortunately, the lady suffered from appendicitis just one year after arriving in Japan and underwent surgery. After that, she was not as healthy as before. Eventually, she developed lung disease due to stress. After a year, she recovered and returned to China this spring, but the journey made her dizzy, and her sleep and diet were disrupted, causing the disease to relapse. After arriving in Shanghai, she suffered from persistent insomnia and mental disorder. Although her sister Peishan tried her best, she could not save her, and she eventually committed suicide. Ms. Yu's girlfriends during her lifetime, both in China and abroad, such as female writers Bai Wei, Shen Ziji, Xie Bingying, Japanese female writers Jinkinshi Shi, Takenaka Shigeru, Hayashi Fumiko, and Nakajo Yuriko, were all extremely close. It is said that after Ms. Yu's funeral, her friends will collect her posthumous writings and compile a memorial collection. The next issue of Women's Life will also publish a special memorial edition for her.

### A Woman, By Nature Cruel and Violent, Whips Her Own Child

A Private Tutor, in Sorrow and Indignation, Takes the Child to Report the Crime; After a Reprimand by the Court, She Awaits Public Prosecution

In Zhabei, Mongol Road, there is a local woman named Yu Choushi, who has a biological son named Yu Qinghui, ten years old. He is studying in a private school run by Shen Pu. However, Yu Choushi is by nature irritable and cruel. She does not know the deep love of a mother for her child, nor does she remember the saying that even a tiger does not eat its cubs. She treats her son like an enemy. Every time the child is naughty, she inflicts severe punishment on him, whipping and stabbing him, causing wounds all over his body. His buttocks and thighs have two holes. How can the child's weak body withstand such torture? He is as thin as a ghost and can hardly move a step. It is like a hell on earth. Shen Pu, the private tutor, saw this tragic scene and was both angry and sad. He took the child to report the crime to the Mongol Road Police Station. After an examination, everyone was filled with indignation. The police were dispatched to arrest Yu Choushi. Yesterday, she was sent to the local court. The prosecutor verified the injuries and, in addition to reprimanding Yu Choushi, ordered her to be detained to await public prosecution. The child was taken out by the tutor and instructed to be handed over to his father to be cared for with love, so as to emphasize humanity and uphold ethical norms.

### Indiscriminate Locking of Bicycles: The Association Sends a Letter to the Authorities Requesting Negotiation

Xin Sheng News Agency reports: The Shanghai Bicycle Manufacturing and Sales Association once sent a letter to the French Concession Taxpayer's Association requesting negotiations regarding the French Concession police's indiscriminate locking of bicycles. The original letter stated: "To whom it may concern: According to reports from our members, the French Concession police's punishment of bicycles has become increasingly severe, especially in the Shiliupu area. Even when various stores send staff to deliver new bicycles, they are often accused of driving without a license, and the bicycles are impounded and fined. Although they argue with reason, the police stations generally rely on the police's one-sided statements and consider it a violation of the road regulations. They refuse to release the bicycles unless a fine is paid. The stores are often unable to argue due to the lack of evidence and have no choice but to admit the loss, pay the fine, and redeem the bicycles. It is even more so for other citizens who are subject to such excessive fines. If this continues, how can we bear the pain? We request that your association find a way to provide relief." (omitted portion) "Therefore, we hereby submit this letter, requesting that you forward it to the French Municipal Council to order the police stations to pay close attention to whether cyclists have violated the regulations and to conduct careful investigations in order to show impartiality. As for new bicycles being driven, if the driver holds a valid invoice issued by the respective store on that day, they should be allowed to pass without being detained or fined. We hope that you will take this into consideration."

### Wang Liting Acquitted in Ancient Book Lawsuit

Xu Jiaheng, a wealthy merchant in Songjiang, had 1,130 ancient books in his collection. In 1935, they suddenly disappeared. It was later discovered in the Shanghai residence of his brother-in-law, Wang Liting. The police were called, and Wang was arrested and brought to the Shanghai Local Court for trial. Wang argued that they were a gift from his mother-in-law (Xu's mother). In the first trial, Tan Zhuohong, who presided over the hearing, sentenced Wang Liting to imprisonment. However, before the verdict was announced, Tan had instructed lawyer Yang Shaopeng to solicit a bribe unsuccessfully before making the judgment. Therefore, the defendant's defense lawyer reported this, and Tan and Yang were both imprisoned in the High Court. This case was one of the origins of the incident. For this reason, Wang Liting was sent back to the Shanghai Court for a retrial by the Third Instance Court. Judge Wang Shanxiang announced the judgment yesterday, overturning the original judgment. Wang Liting was acquitted and explained that the suspicion of the crime existed, but the act did not constitute a crime, so he was acquitted.

### The Municipal Federation Sends a Letter to the Public Works Department Requesting Improvements to the Western Prison Facilities

Prisoners are Not Adequately Fed and Live Without Sunlight; Prompt Improvements Should be Made to Uphold Humanity

The Municipal Federation of Citizens of the First Special District sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday morning stating: "To whom it may concern: According to a joint letter from citizens Zhao Erchang, Ma Zongpei, Zhao Mingzhu, and others, the primary goal of national legislation is clarity. Those who commit crimes should naturally be handed over to the authorities to be punished according to the severity of their offenses. However, with the exception of the death penalty, all other sentences aim to rehabilitate, merely temporarily depriving freedom. Once there is a desire and the fact of reform, there is hope of release from prison, rather than subjecting them to inhuman suffering. Now, the law claims to be civilized, but the reality is the opposite. A friend came to Shanghai and, in less than two months, unfortunately made bad friends and was implicated. After being illegally tortured with electric shocks by the Public Works Department police to extract a confession, the judgment was also increased by more than half. Furthermore, they suffered in the Western Prison under the command of the Public Works Department. They were only able to meet with relatives and friends once every three months, and their faces were yellow and gaunt, which was unbearable to see. It is said that they are not adequately fed in prison. When they spoke, they were in tears. Alas, regardless of whether the imprisonment is unjust or not, in the land of China, they are subjected to the crimes and sentences of a foreign country. The interior of the Western Prison is dark and without sunlight. We urge you to uphold your conscience and promptly supervise and improve the facilities of the Western Prison in order to uphold humanity."

### A Smoker, Liu Yunfang, Commits Suicide in the Hospital by Hanging

On the 19th of this month, he voluntarily checked into the Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road to quit his addiction. At 3:20 p.m. on the 27th, Liu suddenly had a suicidal thought. He took advantage of the fact that people were not paying attention and sneaked into the bathroom, using a towel to hang himself from the hot and cold water pipes. At that time, another patient, Bian Chengming, discovered this and informed the nurse, who reported it to the accounting office and the French police. The body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Mortuary. Yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Ren from the Second Special Court arrived at the mortuary to examine the body and confirmed that it was a suicide by hanging. Because the deceased's family is still in Beiping, Ma Huaqing, the deceased's cousin, claimed the body on their behalf for burial.

Therefore, he believes that Xu and Zhang are suspected of colluding to abduct and hide his daughter. Therefore, at around 10 p.m. last night, he reported the information to the police station, and the police were dispatched to the Shengxin Silk Weaving Factory workshop to arrest Xu Lingnan and Zhang Xiaomei and bring them to the station for questioning.

### Tongle and Six Other Radio Stations Bargain for Low-Priced Acquisitions

The Tongle and six other radio stations in this city previously felt that the Telegraph Bureau's valuation of the machinery to be acquired by order was too low. However, the reason for the banishment was not the fault of the radio stations. Therefore, they again appealed to the industry association for relief, stating that "Upon investigation, the machinery of our stations has been deemed simple and crude, resulting in the banishment. However, in reality, each radio station has been inspected and approved for construction, and then verified by engineers to be qualified before broadcasting. After obtaining the special license, changes cannot be made at will. Therefore, the objects deemed simple and crude are actually the objects verified by the engineers to be qualified. In fact, the responsibility does not lie with our stations, and there is no reason for revocation. Therefore, we went to Beijing to petition, and the Ministry approved the 'Investment to recover the machinery of each station has been ordered to the Bureau to expedite.' There is no so-called subsidy. Now the price offered is so low that it is vastly different from the price our stations purchased. We cannot accept the purchase.

### The Ministry of Finance Approves Changing Each "Yin" of Yunyang Salt to One Hundred Dan

The Ministry of Finance has approved the change of each "yin" of Yunyang salt to one hundred dan, since it is for the sake of being consistent with the Daning salt yard. The order instructs the Salt Affairs General Bureau to instruct compliance. The original text reads, "The Salt Administration Division reported from the Salt Affairs Administration's file before takeover that the former Sichuan Salt Transport Envoy requested that each "yin" of Yunyang salt be changed to one hundred dan, so as to be consistent with the Daning salt yard, praying for review and compliance. Also, the former Director of the Hubei Salt Transportation Bureau presented that the Yunyang salt currently released is based on last year's tax payment, so it will temporarily be released at 127 dan per "yin." After the release is complete, 100 dan will be collected for tax, please review. Upon arrival at the Ministry, it was found that the Daning salt yard had changed the "yin" ticket to one hundred city dan, which was approved by the Ministry in July of last year based on the report forwarded by the former Salt Affairs Inspection General Office, and the order was distributed to the former Sichuan Salt Transport Envoy. Now, according to the previous situation, the request to change each "yin" of Yunyang salt to one hundred dan is also approved, since it is for the sake of being consistent with the Daning salt yard. It is appropriate to order the General Bureau to instruct compliance separately. Once the salt of last year's tax payment has been released, it will be implemented according to the current method, and the implementation date will be reported for review. This order is issued by Minister Kong Xiangxi, acting on behalf of Deputy Minister Zou Lin."

### The Public Concession Reduces Rickshaws, Preparations Completed

According to the Dalu News, the Rickshaw Management Bureau of the Public Concession Police Department announced yesterday (the 27th) that the preparations for implementing the order to reduce 483 rickshaw licenses in the concession starting from June 1st have been completed. Chief Inspector Situ Pingsi, who manages rickshaw affairs, stated yesterday that he has received a list of rickshaw license numbers that should be removed from the Rickshaw Owners Association. When the Public Works Department issues new licenses on June 1st, any licenses that should be removed will be discontinued. Thus, the number of rickshaws in the concession will remain at 9,500. The reduction in licenses was originally scheduled to be implemented on February 1st, but was postponed for three months due to the rickshaw owners' petition, so that the owners could raise funds to compensate those whose licenses were revoked. The chairman of the Rickshaw Owners Association told the Dalu News reporter that the compensation funds have almost been raised. At the latest, by the end of this month, they must be deposited by the subscribing owners into the designated banks. Although the owners initially strongly opposed the reduction, it will be implemented smoothly this time. The compensation donations are collected according to the number of rickshaws owned. Those with fewer than ten rickshaws pay 15 yuan per rickshaw, and those with more than ten rickshaws increase proportionally. This money is entirely to compensate the owners whose licenses were revoked. Of the 483 rickshaws to be reduced, 228 are old and unusable, and the rest are also old-fashioned. Starting from June 1st, of the remaining 9,500 rickshaws, the new-style ones are estimated to be 5,131.

### Central Trust Bureau Agents to Review Income Tax Amounts

Review and Collection Departments Separated, Changing Old Practices

Income tax has been in operation for several months, and the amount reported and paid by all parties has reached more than 4 million yuan in Shanghai alone. However, the review of the tax amount has not yet been completed. Liang Hejun, who also manages the Shanghai office, believes that the entry and exit of this tax amount is very important and is closely related to the taxpayer's obligations. He specially obtained approval from Minister Kong before his departure to entrust the Central Trust Bureau to handle it on its behalf. Currently, the bureau has hired experts to organize the Shanghai Income Tax Amount Review Office. The work of the office has already begun, and the personnel used are selected accounting and audit experts, as well as university professors. In addition, in order to avoid soliciting, the office strictly maintains the confidentiality of review opinions and has warned its staff not to contact the outside world without authorization, in order to maintain the spirit of independent review. It is said that after the implementation of the income tax system, the receipt and collection of taxes, the review of accounts, and the collection work are divided into three powers, changing the previous habits of tax authorities and creating a new era for our country's financial system.

### Record of the Lǐjiào Association Meeting

The Shanghai Office of the Chinese Lǐjiào General Association held a joint meeting of representatives of various public offices the day before yesterday. After Chairman Zhang Yichen reported on the situation of attending the second anniversary conference of the General Association, the following was discussed: ㊀ Public offices in this city and other places have sent letters inquiring about the organization of district branches. It was found that when the central government adjusted the Lǐjiào organization last year, all provincial, municipal, and county branch preparatory committees were stopped from organizing, and public offices were used as units to re-handle the membership registration procedures of public offices. On February 26 of this year, the central government approved the organizational rules for municipal and county branches, which fundamentally do not have district branches. According to the General Association's reply for the same reason, it was decided to ask the chairman to publish it in the Lǐjiào newspaper for general knowledge. ㊁ Qian Baoxi, a member of the Mǐnháng church, was arrested due to a previous letter regarding the case. Now, the Jiashan County Government has certified that he has been released. It was decided to inform the Chóngxìn Táng Public Office. ㊂ Tiānyuán Táng Public Office reported that a member, Zhu Guangxing, was falsely accused and arrested by the Security Command and requested rescue. It was decided to send a letter to the Garrison Command. ㊃ Tiānyuán Táng Public Office sent a letter stating that a member, Shen Shiyu, was due to his daughter-in-law using a pretext to return to Níng and never coming back, and requested that the Nánhuì County Government investigate the matter thoroughly. It was decided to forward it. ㊄ Pǔyuán Cháng Public Office sent a letter stating that Director Cai Zhitian resigned, and Jin Yangwu and Zhao Qingkui were elected as the chairman and vice chairman, respectively, requesting approval. It was decided to submit it to the municipal branch for record. ㊅ Wisdom Hall Public Office sent a letter requesting that former Director Ding transfer the objects. It was decided to allow the notification to be forwarded. ⑥ The Shanghai Personnel Consulting Institute sent a letter stating that its purpose is to connect with all sectors and guide the public to solve personnel problems. An office has been established and the articles of association are attached. It was decided to forward it to all public offices. ⑦ Xiàdòu Sōngbǎi Táng Public Office sent a letter inquiring about the organization of branches. It was decided to reply. The rest is omitted.

Commentary

### Joyful Rain

— Shi Ji

After a heavy rain the night before, the next day cleared up. The day after, a "special dispatch" in the newspaper said: "Sweet rain of three or four inches has fallen in various counties of Jin, and the people are generally joyful." It also said:

"Chengdu and Chongqing areas have also received soaking rain. There was a heavy thunderstorm on the 25th night, damaging electrical equipment and disrupting telephone communication between Chengdu and Chongqing. Counties in southern Sichuan have also received sweet rain, and rice seedlings have been planted, stabilizing the people's hearts." These telegrams were published on the same day as news such as "Sichuan Provincial Government Relief Funds, to be Allocated at the End of the Month" and "Henan Disaster Victims Kneel and Beg for Relief, Present in All Counties." Earlier, there was news of disaster victims kneeling and begging the Beijing-Yunnan Touring Group for relief; even earlier, there was news of "starving people filling the roads, digging up white mud and grass roots to fill their stomachs," and "more than a dozen members of one family starving to death, Li also hanged himself"; recently in Shanghai, it was heard that there was an exhibition a few days ago, displaying the food that disaster victims used to "appease their hunger," in order to evoke pity in benevolent people and encourage generous donations. However, the results did not seem very good.

Now, sweet rain has fallen in some disaster areas. Reading "the people are generally joyful" and "people's hearts are stabilized," we seem to see patients who are haggard and on the verge of death suddenly receiving sweet rain, and a trace of a smile appearing on their sallow faces, causing our hearts to beat faster.

This makes one think that the joy of the disaster victims in the areas receiving sweet rain must be even greater. But does this save their lives?

Relief is like fighting a fire, something we've heard countless times. I don't think I need to waste words to describe the disaster victims' cries for food. However, the relief funds and information about the disaster are still in the stages of "allocation," "investigation," and "drafting reports." Fortunately, at this time, a burst of sweet rain has fallen, "stabilizing the people's hearts" somewhat, and rice seedlings have been planted. However, planting seedlings is not harvesting, and to be more discouraging, the date of harvesting is still far away. So, how will the disaster victims get through the transition period from planting to harvesting, and what will they use to fill their stomachs? One cannot cultivate or have the heart to cultivate on an empty stomach.

Therefore, it is really hard to say what kind of faces will follow the "joyful expressions," and how long "stabilized people's hearts" can remain "stable."

And now it is joyful rain. The rain has "stabilized the people's hearts," the rain has brought hope of recovery, and it seems that only the rain is truly coming to save them.

Some people like to attribute floods and droughts to the will of Heaven. I know the intention behind this, which is to reduce human responsibility and also to reduce the anger of the disaster victims. The common people, having been deceived for a long time, often firmly believe it, so when a drought appears, they first expose the Dragon King to the sun. If that doesn't work, they have no choice but to resign themselves to fate. Of course, they are not willing to just die, so they have no choice but to dig up white mud and grass roots, find "feces," and use all sorts of things that can fill their stomachs to prolong their lives. Then, when they see that there is nothing left to appease their hunger, they kneel and beg for relief. At that time, the news of the extremely severe disaster situation in a certain place finally reaches the ears of those who eat meat porridge.

And once it rains, the disaster victims think that Heaven's will has changed, and those who survive are filled with joy. In the beginning, it is not just about planting seedlings.

In this way, how can the disaster victims not rejoice in the rain!

### Dead City

— Kang Li

In the year when the whole country was suffering from a great famine due to American wheat, I was teaching in a small county town. Because the county magistrate was an educator, he knew that running schools was as important as distributing food and rescuing the hungry, so no matter how much people suffered, this only primary school in the county was determined not to close.

There were six of us colleagues, and we only hoped to have food to eat. When the school started, the disaster in this county was not very severe, and we could eat three meals of dry rice a day (ordinary families were like this). Later, the number of famine refugees from neighboring counties increased day by day, and grain prices rose to twenty yuan per stone. We reduced one breakfast, going to class on empty stomachs. By early April, the situation was even worse: we had money but nowhere to buy rice, flour was horrifyingly expensive, and there were so many refugees everywhere that our school building, converted from the county's Confucius Temple, was surrounded so tightly that not even water could pass through. At meal times, we had to station "armed comrades" in the dining hall, otherwise before we even sat down, they would start a "general attack."

Every time I ate, my heart felt like it was being stabbed by a sharp knife, because if I just looked up, there would be hundreds and thousands of yellow faces outside the windows and doors, staring at us with their eyes wide open, especially the cries of those children, which made it impossible to swallow.

One evening, the person guarding the door couldn't resist anymore and just shouted madly, "Teachers! Teachers! Run! It's no good..." As soon as we got up, the people outside rushed in like a raging tide. Bowls of vegetables, buckets of rice... a cacophony of sounds. I was so scared that I quickly hid under the table, watching them grab whatever they could and stuff it into their mouths. Some of the elderly were so choked by a mouthful of rice that tears streamed down their faces. The children had bits of food snatched for them by their guardians, but their little mouths were even more pinched and small from hunger, unable to eat it, and then it was snatched away by others. Thus, crying, cursing, and fighting caused chaos and darkness. At this time, my heart was about to explode, and I was trembling all over, unable to stand up.

Later, the person guarding the door ran out and called for reinforcements. More than a dozen "armed comrades" with leather whips and bamboo roots rushed in, engaging in a "melee." The weak refugees were no match for them, fleeing, shouting wildly, begging for mercy. Many children and old men fell to the ground, breaking their legs, and their cries of pain and sorrow really broke my heart. The most cruel thing was that a little girl's stomach had been kicked open, and her intestines, stomach, blood, and flesh were all over the ground. Her little hands were still shaking, and her two black eyes were still wide open, not closing. Inside her blue floral jacket, there was a white taro. "What! Is this a nightmare, or am I in hell?" I walked away with tears in my eyes.

The school could no longer be maintained, and the teachers' meals were the biggest problem, because the Confucius Temple was public land and could not

## Page 19

prevent people from entering freely. The rooms were all open like factories and could not be blocked off. When the food was cooked, it was surrounded like an iron bucket, and no matter how you tried to prevent it, beat them, or kill them, you could not defeat their struggle for hunger.

The shops on the street had long been closed, and peddlers did not dare to take food to sell. The grass roots in the fields and the bark on the mountains had long been peeled bare and yellow, and even the water chestnuts and reeds in the water had been picked clean. People died and dared not cry, fearing to alarm the crowd and have them dug out of the soil to be used as soup. Cattle, horses, chickens, and dogs had all been turned into fertilizer, and the population slowly decreased.

Our students were mostly sons of wealthy merchants and landowners. For the first two months after school started, there was nothing strange, but after March, they began to decrease day by day. Some said they disappeared on the road, others said they only found their clothes, pants, socks, and shoes, but the people could not be found. Terror increased day by day, food decreased day by day, and the entire county town fell into a state of death. We went from two meals to one meal of porridge and one meal of dry rice, and later they all became porridge. When the rice ran out, there was no more porridge, only flour and water to eat. I couldn't get used to eating flour, and it accumulated in my stomach and wouldn't digest. In less than a week, I was sick in bed, and my stomach was swollen like a lantern.

Now there is another famine in Sichuan, and when I think of the situation at that time, I can't help but tremble with cold. The eyes of the little girl who was trampled to death seem to be flashing in front of me again.

### Reflection House

— Luo Peng

— Reflections in an Ancient City

That day was a Sunday, and the weather was very mild. The sandy ground in the alley had a kind of steamed dampness.

I was walking on the street, thinking of him—that brown-haired boy, a sleepyhead in geometry class, a bold debater in political class. Sometimes he was very frustrated and sighed at the despair of the nation; on some days, he was inexplicably busy, making people imagine that he was doing something earth-shattering. I don't know when I stopped seeing him. I asked my classmates, but got no information. I asked his close friends, but only got smiles. So, gradually, I felt annoyed by his disappearance.

Unexpectedly, I received a letter from him from the Reflection House. "Can you come see me on the 2nd? If you can't make it, the 12th or 22nd will also work," he said.

"An Andrew who doesn't walk the right path," can I blame him like that? But I will see him immediately, will I blame him? No, I should comfort him.

The small cypress trees in front of the church were neatly trimmed by the workers, looking green, cute and innocent. "They are free"! I thought as I entered a small door and walked along the alley. In a corner of the back street, I found that moon gate. I stepped on the empty and bright stone steps of the corridor, walking towards the end of the corridor. There were two blurry figures in the shadows of the wall, as if praying.

That second door was locked. From between the thick wooden boards, no sound or smell could escape. I waited for that slow morning hour. Inside the door, those ignorant criminal souls had not forgotten this happy morning. In the spring air on the top of the wall, mixed with their sighs, like two light powder butterflies crossing the tiled wall, fluttering on the high branches of the houses across the street. Especially on this windless and rainless early spring day, hope rises into a few white clouds, dancing with the imagined water spirits. The ignorant heart should also be silent.

Three figures appeared in the first door, a middle-aged man carrying a pair of cloth bags; a young man carrying green-covered books; and an old lady leaning on a smooth cane: they walked slowly, as if walking from another ancient temple.

The time was approaching eight o'clock, and the door suddenly opened a crack. I should have entered at the same time as the first person, but he very kindly yielded to the old lady.

After we walked in, the door immediately closed again. I saw a large square courtyard, with stone steps as bright and clean as those seen in ancient temples, connecting three sides of the houses. There were several guards casting their gray shadows on the dim corridor.

In the gatehouse, I was questioned and registered in the register: then I followed the guide towards the stone steps of the main house. In that corridor, I discovered a white, familiar, and lively face, slightly protruding brown hair, peeking out from a window. Look! Is he smiling? Is he happy? But we were separated by a brick wall and a row of iron bars. But I don't know if I can shake his hand here?

I used my eyes to probe the eyes of the guard. He didn't say anything, and I already understood what was allowed.

Through the gap in the iron bars, I shook his cold hand and asked him:

"Is it good here?"

"We can read some books: sometimes we can play ball, which is to be grateful for; also, we can wash our own clothes."

I saw his snow-white shirt collar, which gave me a colder feeling more clearly than his white face. But I immediately remembered that the snow had melted, and the spring breeze was also warm; I also thought of playing ball, which should be the most relaxing game.

I suddenly heard the friction of the iron chains at his feet, and I was stunned for a few seconds. I felt a bitter smile on my face, which must have looked very bad. I had a thousand words I wanted to say to him, but I couldn't. His nonchalant smile calmed my heart. I tried my best to reject the intrusion of the small and slick sound of iron grinding. "I will come again next time. Do you need medicine or books?"

"That's too much to ask. I only ask you, can you write a letter to inform my father and mother."

I agreed to his request and asked for his home address. We were speechless again, and silence was like a thousand words buried in each other's hearts and lungs.

I turned my body: "Goodbye!"

He turned his head and disappeared between the light and dark of the window: "Goodbye!"

The old lady was trembling at a window. She seemed to have a kind of fear from within, fearing the sudden attack of fate. The guard urged her helplessly.

Out of the second door, I walked towards the outside along the stone steps, my head heavy. The old lady grabbed the corner of my clothes. Sadness and confusion born of a kind of closeness filled every wrinkle on her face. She asked, "Can he come out?" she asked confusedly.

I replied "Wait and see" and left her and those anxious people, walking along the back street, past the library, towards the stone railings by the Yulian Bridge; because sitting there, I can see the bright and snow-like apricot forest at the bottom of the North Sea.

### Lonely Journey

— Liang Qiyun

"What is someone doing?" The intimate whisper rang in my ear, it was Fang, my neighbor. In the dimness of dusk, his thin face appeared unusually pale.

"Thinking—"

"Homesickness?"

"A little."

"Guangdong mangoes are on the market, very expensive, three for a dollar."

"Don't you feel lonely? You,"

"A little."

"Why are you so unenthusiastic?"

"Um,..."

We are all travelers on the road, but our hearts are different. I use silence to reconcile all our barriers, what we need is mutual "understanding."...

Leaning on the railing, I sighed silently, gazing at the distant sky. My body, tormented by fourteen hours of work, felt fatigued as if every joint had been heavily hammered with iron tools. Throwing the bitter-tasting cigarette butt into the heart of the river, I began to notice this old and worn-out inn squatting arduously by the river. Its appearance is haggard, its days are lonely, its shadow is solitary, and the paint on the railing in the corridor is peeling off, revealing a gray-white face with a miserable smile. The calm river water passes by here every moment, lingeringly turning a corner, and then, seemingly feeling nothing gained, resentfully walking away. I have always felt indifferent to this flowing water carrying time, but now, I feel a kind of terror.

Yes, a kind of terror, because I thought of "the future."

Continued on page 5

So, I tightly grasped Fang's hand. His pale and slender skin touched my hand. I was surprised to feel that his hand was frighteningly cold.

"What's wrong?" he asked me.

"The weather is very depressing," I said.

He reached out and stroked my feverish forehead:

"You're sick, definitely."

"No," I said firmly.

Sickness should be the enjoyment of the fortunate. I know that my body is sick; but, people who have entered the world—unless they are blind—have no time to consider illnesses other than those that treat the spirit. Sometimes, I think of the wanderers who drift for years on the vast sea, and I also think of the camels trekking long distances in the cold and desolate desert. Have they ever thought about what tomorrow will be like for them? —My heart is trembling, I am a traveler in the wilderness of the night....

"Look, isn't it raining over there?" Fang's voice was spasmodic, as if he was saying something in pain.

I raised my head and looked at the gradually darkening sky. Beneath the vast and distant canopy of night, the shadow of Lion Rock changed from a bright purple to a gloomy darkness. Gray clouds hurriedly flowed over the top of the mountain. The northeast corner was filled with large piles of black clouds, and it must be raining heavily over there....

Under the black eaves across the river, a dim yellow light shone. Suddenly, a pair of black bats darted across the surface of the water, and quickly disappeared somewhere. —Its appearance and disappearance are unpredictable, just like many of the things that are about to happen to us.

Under the stone bridge, a tattered sampan came out. The splashing sound of oars brought my thoughts back from distant lands, but loneliness immediately isolated me from everything else.

On the bridge, a team of evening exercises was returning, singing "Fight back to our hometown" in loud and heroic voices. ...

The descent of night is slow. —That terrifying blackness slowly and laboriously covers everything around. —Although, at dawn, it will quietly retreat.

Yes, there is no eternal night, and travelers on the night road will receive "comfort" tomorrow.

### Firefly

— Zi Feng

It's late.

The sky is pitch black, no moonlight, no stars.

We are walking along the highway lined with white poplars: the evening breeze carries the leaves of the white poplars rustling like the sighs of an old man in his twilight years. However, their trunks are so towering, stretching upwards, stretching upwards. Straight into that dark sky.

On both sides of the road are small rivers, the croaking of frogs and the sounds of insects are intertwined: like a beautiful fantasy, unfolding on the wasteland.

Accompanied by the evening breeze, accompanied by the night. Crawling, crawling.

Occasionally, a few fireflies fly from the surface of the water. Flickering. —The eyes of the night wanderer. We all pounce on them:

Does it comfort the night?

Does it scatter the seeds of light in the night?

Does it express the longing for hope?

We didn't catch any: one by one, flickering with blue-green eyes, like shooting stars, fell into the vast dark bushes in front, temporarily extinguished.

Strangely, this tiny light makes my heart tremble.

The tiny in the vast is great.

They fly up again in front. Blink with blue-green eyes.

We chase after them again, and they all swing open. Only one remains in my hand. Then I put it in my pocket.

It didn't light up again until half a day later. However, it lost the greatness of its tiny in the vastness. It flickered haggardly, like a patient.

It grows in the vastness, and cannot live in a pocket.

Let it go.

Let it scatter the seeds of light in the vast night; waiting for them to grow up under their wings!

As soon as I let go, it flew away.

Flying into the vastness, it became great.

The pitch-black night, no moonlight, no stars.

My heart is beating, like the twinkling eyes of a firefly.

Let it also be released into the vastness!

The evening breeze carries the leaves of the white poplars rustling.
