### Song Zheyuan Releases Statement

Met With Tashiro Several Times, Did Not Discuss Diplomacy; Economic Development to Start With Mining and Road Construction

[Beiping] When meeting with reporters on the morning of the 10th, Song Zheyuan said that during his stay in Tianjin for over a month, he had met with Acting Commander Tashiro several times, but these were only ordinary social gatherings and did not involve any specific diplomatic issues. Regarding diplomacy, there are diplomats responsible for it. He only knows to follow the intentions of the Central Government and consider the actual situation to seek benefits for the locality. He has always advocated supporting the Central Government and stabilizing the locality. Nitpicking at the Central Government is the biggest mistake. Therefore, he will continue to uphold this principle in the future, striving to ensure that the local people live and work in peace and contentment. Regarding economic development, he will still adhere to the principles of coexistence, co-prosperity, equality, and mutual benefit, starting with the development of mineral resources and the construction of railways. The current projects underway are the construction of the Cangshi Road and the mining of the Longyan iron ore. He has had many contacts with the Japanese side, but concrete measures have not yet been decided. The rumor that construction of the Cangshi Road is about to begin is not accurate. The Japanese army's plan to expand barracks in Fengtai has been shelved due to public opposition.

### Preliminary Agreement Signed for Export of Lu Salt to Japan

To be Submitted to Both Governments for Approval; First Batch to be 100,000 Tons

[Tianjin] The preliminary agreement for the export of Lu salt to Japan was signed at the Changlu Transportation Office at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th, one day ahead of schedule. The Japanese representative was Hirayama Keizo of the Xingzhong Corporation, and the director of the Salt Affairs Department was Kiyono Jotaro. The Chinese representatives were Li Shuhua, the Changlu Transport Commissioner; Li Menglu, the special commissioner of the Hebei-Chahar Economic Council; Shao Jingyin, manager of the Lufeng Store; and Xu Xianfang, the assistant manager. The signing was completed at 4:00 PM. Li Menglu returned to Beiping in the evening to report to Li Sihao. The agreement will be submitted to both governments for approval, and then four official copies will be drafted and stored by the relevant authorities on both sides, as well as by the buyers and sellers. The preliminary agreement consists of ten articles, the main points of which are that the first batch will be 100,000 tons at a price of 2.3622 yuan per ton. The Xingzhong Corporation sent an official letter to the Lufeng Store, reserving the right to purchase an additional 130,000 tons, but a separate agreement must be signed for this. The buyer has the freedom to increase or decrease the quantity by 5%. The shipping period will begin in early March and end at the end of this year. Export will only be possible after the Tianjin Customs receives an order from the Ministry of Finance. Payment for the salt will be made in advance before loading, and the full amount will be paid upon completion of half of the export quantity. After the agreement is established, the seller shall not sell to anyone other than the buyer for transport to Japan, and the buyer shall not directly purchase or transport from other salt flats. Currently, there are only 700,000 tons of Lu salt stored in the Dagu salt flats. The Transportation Office fears that signing an agreement for the Japanese side to purchase 230,000 tons at once will affect the food supply for the people, so it will only sign the second batch of the agreement after there is a surplus.

Chen replied that the establishment of the committee was still based on the advocacy of previous years and that he would strive to encourage himself with three things: 1. To integrate the academic knowledge of Chinese and Western medicine into one to form a new Chinese-based medicine. 2. To enable traditional Chinese medicine practitioners across the country to benefit from scientific education so that they can share the great responsibility of improving the health of the people with Western medicine at the same level. 3. In the past, many medical disputes arose from misunderstandings, which should be avoided in the future. The proposals of the meeting included: 1. Should the application for traditional Chinese medicine certificates in various provinces and cities be handled by the committee or issued by the local government? 2. Designating several people to study traditional Chinese medicine schools and determine standards. 3. Requesting the establishment of training classes for traditional Chinese medicine health. 4. Formulating measures for the registration of traditional Chinese medicine associations to be approved and promulgated. 5. How should the sale of proprietary Chinese medicines in various pharmacies be reorganized and standardized? 6.

### Minnan Zhangzhou Bandit Wen Yaye Executed

Bandit Inflicted Cruelty on Several Counties, Killing Hundreds and Burying Dozens Alive

Xiamen Correspondence: After the troops stationed in Zhangzhou (Yunxiao, Zhao'an, Pinghe, Zhangpu) suppressed the communist bandits, the area along the Longxi Road became peaceful. The bandit areas of Yunxiao and Zhao'an were also recovered. The remaining bandits fled back to their old nests in Liangshan in Pinghe and Wushan in Yunxiao, and established a fake Yun Zhao and Rao Border Region Committee, causing disturbances in the border region of the four counties of Yunxiao, Zhao'an, He, and Rao between Fujian and Guangdong. The troops stationed in Yunxiao continued to encircle and suppress Wushan. On March 1, the troops stationed there, together with the strong men of seven villages in the 11th District, captured the bandit leader Wen Yaye, the fake border region committee member, and four others: Li Xin-chun, Zhan Shun-shi (fake transport), Zhan Lian-tai (fake propagandist). Two pistols and two bombs were seized. Wen had been engaged in propaganda work in Zhangzhou for many years, and the bandit nest in Wushan was created by him. He was extremely cruel, and tens of thousands of families were ruined because of him. On March 2, the troops stationed there executed Wen and Li Xin-chun. The families of the victims trampled on their corpses, and some even cut out their hearts to vent their anger. The troops also prepared a bulletin of Wen's crimes, stating: "The notorious bandit Wen Yaye has long been engaged in propaganda work in the Yun (xiao), Zhao (an), He, and other border regions. A large number of intellectuals with weak will and ignorant good people in various places have been deceived and blindly followed him. Hundreds of people have been burned, killed, and robbed by the bandit leader's rifles and knives. Fifty or sixty people have been captured and buried alive. On March 1, he was captured by our army while propagating communism to the people in Wushi Resistance. Wen Yaye, the fake border region committee member of Yun (xiao), Zhao (an), and He, and Li Xin-chun, the fake transport member, were interrogated and admitted that they had been important figures in the bandit party for many years, which warrants the death penalty to appease the people." Wen was a native of Raoping, Guangdong, 26 years old. (March 7)

### Anhui Business Community Reorganizes the Provincial Business Federation

This Proposal Arose Due to Research on Income Tax, and It Will Become a Tool for Developing Commerce Abroad

Wuhu Correspondence: Five or six years ago, various counties and towns in Anhui had an organization called the Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation. Wuhu, due to its convenient location and transportation and its status as a commercial hub, had the federation's headquarters attached to the Wuhu County Chamber of Commerce. Later, due to the economic recession in commerce and finance, the membership fees owed by the chambers of commerce in various counties and towns were not paid, and the work of the Federation itself became unusually slack. The Provincial Government ordered it to cease its activities some years ago, and the only union of merchants in Anhui was once again scattered. This time, the government is promoting income tax, and the procedures involved are most relevant to the interests of merchants. Moreover, the business tax rate in Anhui Province is particularly harsh. Chambers of commerce in important counties and towns in northern and southern Anhui have sent representatives to Wuhu to hold a conference to discuss income tax. In addition to unanimously agreeing to send telegrams to all parties to strive for the cessation or improvement of business tax in order to alleviate the hardships of merchants, many achievements have also been made regarding the points that should be requested for income tax. During the meeting, it was generally agreed that in this era of commercial warfare, it is necessary to reorganize the commercial institutions in various parts of the province. Otherwise, power cannot be concentrated, and the group will hardly be able to develop. It is like a soul without a body, without anything to rely on. After discussion, it was decided to reorganize the Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation, and a joint telegram was sent to the Anhui Provincial Party Headquarters requesting the issuance of a permit and the dispatch of personnel to guide the preparations. The original telegram is recorded below: "A petition to initiate the organization of the Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation, requesting your department to approve the issuance of a permit to facilitate preparations. It has been found that the Chamber of Commerce Law stipulates that there should be an organization of a federation of chambers of commerce in each province, so as to unite industry and commerce throughout the province as a tool for external development. Moreover, in the current world of commercial competition, Anhui Province is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, with abundant products, and it is particularly necessary to develop externally. The members of the association have gathered in Wuhu to discuss and study income tax, and now state the reasons for initiating the organization of the Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation in accordance with Article 37 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, requesting your department to approve the issuance of a permit in accordance with Section 2 of the Third Section of the Organizational Plan of People's Organizations, and to send personnel to guide the preparations, which is truly convenient for the public."

### Japanese House of Peers Questions Foreign Policy Towards China

Katsuta Criticizes Hirota's Clumsy Diplomacy, Praising the Success of British Policy as a Model to Follow, Sato Clarifies Policy to the House Today

[Tokyo] Japanese Foreign Minister Sato Naotake will respond tomorrow in the House of Representatives to questions raised by Minseito Party member Tsurumi Yusuke and Seiyukai Party member Ashida Hitoshi. Sato will clarify Japan's foreign policy at that time. (Reuters, Tokyo, 10th)

[Tokyo] During a meeting of the Budget Committee of the Japanese House of Peers this morning, after questioning domestic issues, Katsuta Shukei turned to foreign policy. He first criticized the Prime Minister for repeatedly using the term "multilateral diplomacy" in his response to questions from the House of Representatives. He felt that the name "multilateral diplomacy" was "very inappropriate." Katsuta continued, saying that Prime Minister Hayashi's explanation of economic diplomacy was indeed Japan's diplomacy of twenty years ago. Although it was economic in nature at that time, there was never such a name. Japan's main diplomacy towards China is economic diplomacy, but unfortunately it has never been able to show its effect. British diplomacy towards China has been economic diplomacy from beginning to end and has never changed for decades, so it can be successful. Although Japan has established the Yokohama Specie Bank in China, its business is purely foreign exchange and does not have the investment power of HSBC. I feel that we will need to open such a bank in the future. What does the government think? Katsuta then asked, Since the Okada Cabinet, Hirota has promoted the three principles of diplomacy towards China. The spirit is indeed correct, but the method of implementation is clumsy, so Hirota's diplomacy ultimately failed. Foreign Minister Sato Naotake stated that he does not intend to completely change the policies of previous foreign ministers, but will only change what he considers to be unsuitable. Katsuta then said, If so, which aspects of the previous cabinet's foreign policy are suitable, and which are not? Sato replied that matters such as economic diplomacy and the establishment of a HSBC-like bank in China are related to the Ministry of Finance, so he will fully consult with the Ministry of Finance. As for the various points I mentioned at the General Assembly of the House of Peers, they are only policy guidelines and my current state of mind. As for concrete problems, which should be continued and which should be changed, I have not yet decided, and this kind of problem cannot be decided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs alone. It will soon consult with relevant ministries. (Central News Agency, 10th)

[Tokyo] The General Budget Meeting of the House of Peers opened at 10:12 a.m. on the 10th. Iwakura Michikata first spoke on the procedural agenda, saying that the deliberation period was insufficient and asked what the government's views were. At that time, Prime Minister Hayashi was absent, so Kodama Vice Minister replied on his behalf, saying that if it was unavoidable, he would give it full consideration. Next, Katsuta Shukei of the Study Group rose and said that the elucidation of the national polity should be fully understood by the entire nation. Why was it deliberately listed as the first principle of the political platform, causing foreigners to misunderstand? He believed that he should be very cautious. Also, recently in the House of Representatives, there were words such as multilateral diplomacy and dual diplomacy. It was found that our country's diplomacy is originally unipolar, not multilateral, and this kind of tone is considered sufficient to make foreigners distrust our country's diplomacy. Therefore, the Prime Minister of a country should be extremely cautious in his statements, especially when openly declaring it on the political platform, which is inappropriate. He should explain the reason. As for the current cabinet, it claims to focus on economic diplomacy, but economic diplomacy has been the focus since twenty years ago. Therefore, the term economic diplomacy is only referred to as diplomacy (and it is not inappropriate to call it economic diplomacy again today, but it is only talk and will have no effect. It has been found that the United Kingdom's policy toward China is all economic diplomacy, and it has been successful for thirty years. If economic diplomacy is to be implemented, a bank like HSBC in the United Kingdom should be established. What is the government's view on this? As for diplomacy toward China, since the Okada Cabinet, there have been so-called three major principles. The other day, Foreign Minister Sato said in his speech to the House of Peers that he would extract the advantages of the previous cabinet's diplomatic policy, saying that he intended to implement it, but what are the advantages, and what are the disadvantages? He should answer.

Foreign Minister Sato replied that he believes that it is necessary for our country to imitate HSBC in the United Kingdom in economic diplomacy, which is extremely important and belongs to financial matters, so he should fully consult with the authorities of the Ministry of Finance. As for the various points mentioned in the House of Peers yesterday, they are only a general outline of the policy. He has not yet fully formed an opinion on which policies to follow and which to change. He will try to consult with the ministers concerned in the near future.

Finance Minister Yuuki replied that the financial institutions that have existed so far in diplomacy toward China each have their own duties, and their activities cannot be considered sufficient. In the future, they should be made to function fully, and he should fully consult with the relevant authorities.

Katsuta also said that the Foreign Minister, who has only been in office for a short time, is right, but the facts are urgent, and he should quickly seek countermeasures and hope to study the domestic situation and handle it carefully. The so-called new administration of the current cabinet, what kind of ghosts and snakes are they, and what is the bottom line? He should explain it in detail. Secondly, regarding the uneasy situation of the budget, he believes that there are still not enough people who can expand the national power. The current cabinet should establish a certain theory, set the tax system according to its theory, and then study the fundamental methods. This claim is the cause of uneasiness in the world and should clearly explain the future of the budget. After a short break at half past noon, the meeting continued at half past one in the afternoon. Prime Minister Hayashi explained Japan's ideal of building the country and replied as follows: He hopes to be cautious in his use of the language of diplomatic dualization, and he will try his best to avoid terms such as dualization. The so-called new administration is considered to have empty content and makes the people uneasy. He will pay attention to it, but the political platform, whether internal or external, has been carefully considered, to promote national progress and stabilize the people's hearts, to advocate stability, and to eliminate radicalism, in order to implement the government.

Katsuta then said, "What is the government's view on adjusting prices through the budget? What is the approximate amount of money needed for international loans and shipments of currency? The status of currency in the world must be carefully considered, because countries around the world are competing to reserve currency for the purpose of national defense. The current cabinet is handling this matter too hastily, which is chilling. As for amending the Bank of Japan Act and the low-interest policy, please express your general views."

After Finance Minister Yuuki explained everything, Baron Okura Kobo asked a question about establishing a political platform. Prime Minister Hayashi replied with the same feeling, and Prime Minister Hayashi also replied that he was considering the new administration and the establishment of a new advisory national policy agency. The meeting adjourned at 3:55 p.m. (Allied News Agency, 10th)

### Japanese Four Ministers Maintain Contact

In Order to Determine Specific Measures

[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Sato now believes that it is necessary to establish a new diplomatic policy. The first step is to propose the establishment of a meeting of relevant ministers after the closure of the Diet. Its scope is the same as that of the previous cabinet. It is uncertain whether the meeting of the three ministers of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs will become a permanent agency, or whether the ministers concerned should be asked to participate in the consultation at any time, depending on the necessity, and whether the old practice is appropriate. However, the Lin Cabinet's policy toward China is mainly based on the economic view of civilian contact and has a close relationship with the financial authorities. Also, since Finance Minister Yuki had his own views on Sino-Japanese economic diplomacy when he was the president of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry, he has joined Finance Minister Yuki, and the four ministers of the Army, Navy, Foreign Affairs, and Finance will be the center of the establishment of a four-province affairs authorities meeting in order to start a re-examination of diplomatic policies. (Allied News Agency, 10th)

### Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Answers Reporters' Questions

Irrelevant

[Tokyo] Foreign reporters visited the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs today and asked whether Foreign Minister Sato Naotake's speech in the House of Peers on the 8th of this month could be regarded as Japan changing its attitude and respecting all international agreements signed by Japan. The spokesman replied lightly, saying that he also thought so. When asked about the Nine-Power Treaty, the spokesman replied that he thought so as well. When asked again about Japan's guarantee of China's sovereignty and territorial integrity in the treaty, the spokesman replied again that he also thought so. At this point, the reporters of various newspapers asked whether the attitude of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs towards Wang Chonghui, as shown by the Asahi Shimbun yesterday, was true. The spokesman said that in principle there should be no problem, because the so-called equality and reciprocity are principles recognized by international law, but if it involves concrete issues such as eastern Hebei and northern Chahar, it should be regarded as another event due to its complexity. (Central News Agency, 10th)

### Japanese Government Defense Room Bill

Submitted to the House of Representatives

[Tokyo] The government submitted the Air Defense Bill to the House of Representatives on the 9th. Its content is to prepare the general public other than the army and navy for air defense under a certain plan. Although there have been air defense exercises in various important cities, there is no legal basis, and the content of the exercises varies from region to region, with no control force. The exercises are only implemented with a temporary plan, so it is difficult to prepare the necessary equipment in the event of an emergency. Therefore, the air defense affairs will be legalized, and air defense plans will be stipulated, and training will be implemented on the basis of this plan from peacetime, and necessary air defense materials will be gradually prepared. The main points are roughly as follows:

(1) Elucidate the content of air defense and air defense plans and stipulate the obligations regarding air defense plans;

(2) On the basis of the necessity of air defense, stipulate the scope of orders and implement obligations regardless of conditions such as salary;

(3) Stipulate matters related to air defense training;

(4) Regarding the burden of expenses, make necessary provisions for national treasury subsidies;

(5) Regarding other matters, set up necessary provisions. Based on the above-mentioned guidelines, the Air Defense Bill has a total of twenty-two articles. (Allied News Agency, 10th)

Tokyo Chamber of Commerce Suggests Establishing a Foreign Trade Association

### Soviet Union Refuses Entry to Japanese Embassy Translator

Japanese Foreign Ministry Attaches Importance

[Tokyo] The Soviet Union's refusal to allow Japanese Embassy translator Sugihara to enter the country has been repeatedly negotiated with the Soviet government by Ambassador Shigemitsu and Counselor Sugimoto. Recently, when Ambassador Shigemitsu met with Foreign Vice Minister Stomoniakov, he said that such an incomprehensible fact was arousing the Soviet side's attention to the new relationship that Japan and the Soviet Union must develop. (Allied News Agency, 10th)

### After Pentecost, the British Prime Minister Will Resign

Chamberlain to Succeed as Prime Minister

[London] It is rumored that British Prime Minister Baldwin will resign from his position immediately after Pentecost, likely around May 26th. It is said that the Prime Minister has a very busy schedule in the week leading up to May 26th, with appointments every day. The King and Queen are scheduled to host a banquet on the 25th, so the Prime Minister will definitely not have time to submit his resignation in the week before the 26th. Although the above news is not from official sources, it is said with certainty and is likely not without reason. Political reporters here predict that Baldwin will likely be ennobled as an Earl, and MacDonald will also enter the House of Lords. The succession of Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain to the position of Prime Minister is generally considered inevitable. First Lord of the Admiralty Hoare and President of the Board of Trade Runciman are said to be the most promising candidates for the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer. (Central News Agency, roadside dispatch, 10th)

### German Ambassador to Britain Returned to His Post Yesterday

Rumored to be Carrying New Instructions to Negotiate the Locarno Treaty Issue

[Berlin] German Ambassador to Britain, General Ribbentrop, is scheduled to return to London today. It is generally believed that he is carrying new instructions for negotiating the Western European Pact. Officials here are currently paying close attention to this matter. Germany's second step will likely be to respond to the British memorandum from November of last year. The main points of the reply are currently under consideration. It is generally believed that negotiations will continue through ordinary diplomatic channels in the future, as it seems unlikely that a meeting convened without sufficient preparation would be successful. Political circles here believe that the Spanish issue may be resolved soon, so they are quite optimistic about the outcome of these negotiations. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 10th)

### Soviet Union Purchases Goods from Britain in Large Quantities

It is said that Soviet orders account for a large portion of the annual output of British machine tool manufacturers. (TASS dispatch, 9th)

Current Commentary

### The Significance of Economic Cooperation

— Liu

Recently, noteworthy international economic developments include: in Europe, France abolished foreign exchange controls and resumed a liberal policy; the Geneva League of Nations raw materials conference discussed the issue of raw material allocation; and in East Asia, Japan's economic policy has recently become very active. The Japanese Diet has clearly outlined the establishment of a Japanese-"Manchukuo" economic system, and economic envoys such as Kodama will depart for China tomorrow. The Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China is also preparing to hold a joint meeting in Shanghai. It is said that among its 26 proposals, 11 involve requesting negotiations to reduce tariffs. All of these economic activities directly or indirectly target China.

Since our country has become a target of Japan's economic development, we must deeply understand Japan's economic objectives. This information is readily available. Recently, the Japanese representative made a frank statement at the League of Nations raw materials conference, saying, "Making it convenient for raw materials to enter Japan is not enough to alleviate the current difficulties. It is necessary to simultaneously take various measures to facilitate the international trade of industrial manufactured goods." From these words, Japan's intention is to achieve two goals with one arrow, which is very obvious. However, before the import restriction systems of various countries are abolished, how will Japan break the current situation and seek to solve the problem of exporting Japanese goods and collecting raw materials? The answer to this question can be gleaned from the recent response of the Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry to the Diet members: "Manchuria produces raw materials. It would be best for Japan to process these raw materials... Currently, we want to combine Japan and Manchuria into one economic group... In fact, the tea production plan in Manchuria and its funding are all created by Japan. If Manchuria is threatened by China in this way, it would be a great humiliation for our country (Japan's commerce)..." Such is Japan's fundamental intention for economic development. Therefore, the nature of so-called economic cooperation is easy to imagine. Even if we set this aside, it is not difficult to understand the meaning of this new term simply by examining the current facts. In recent years, textile industries in Tianjin and Qingdao have successively fallen into the hands of the Japanese. Currently, Japanese merchants own more than three million spindles in Chinese textile mills. Not only is the Shanghai yarn market unable to be as independent as it once was, but it is also often constrained by the Qingdao yarn market. It is feared that before long, not only North China but also the entire country's textile industry will be completely controlled by them. Isn't the soy bean cake market's control by the Dalian specialty market in recent years a clear example? Furthermore, everyone knows that smuggling in North China is a situation created by special forces, not a result of tariff policy. However, the other side still talks about negotiating tax reductions. Although they claim that regular merchants do not want to collude and are unwilling to suffer losses, they make this request. It should be known that even if taxes are increased before the situation in eastern Hebei is restored, smuggling may be stopped. Moreover, tax reduction is a fatal blow to China's original industry and commerce.

In short, those who plot against us are thorough, and it is only natural that they have plans and steps. We can only strive for what is called equality and mutual benefit to be consistent with the name and reality.

### Spanish Nationalist Forces Launch Major Offensive

Government Forces Resist Vigorously but Fail - Fate of Madrid Depends on This Battle

⊙ Madrid: A battle is currently raging about 65 miles northeast of Madrid, the scale of which is rare since the beginning of the civil war. The fate of Madrid may depend on this battle. After receiving heavy support, the Nationalist army launched a new offensive yesterday. As a result of the day's fighting, they advanced seven and a half miles along a broad front. The Nationalist army aims to further reduce the area surrounding Madrid and the main roads connecting the capital to the outside world through the Jingdong area. After gaining ground yesterday, they continued their fierce attack today. Although the government army's communiqué today acknowledged yesterday's retreat, it said that they are still bravely resisting the enemy. After fierce battles on the Guadalajara front yesterday, government forces were attacked on the Madrid front by a superior enemy force from the north. According to a communiqué from the Defense Committee, government forces were forced to retreat on the Corroel Villa front, and the enemy is still advancing there.

### Incident of Western Government Merchant Ship Being Bombed

Crew and Passengers All Shot - Only Two Escape by Swimming

⊙ Hendaye: The command of the San Sebastian fortress in Spain announced today that the "Mar Cantabrico" ship has safely arrived at the Nationalist-controlled port of Faro in the Bay of Biscay. (National News dispatch, 10th)

[Paris] After the Spanish government army's merchant ship "Mar Cantabrico" was sunk yesterday by the Nationalist cruiser "Canarias" in the Bay of Biscay, the newspaper's special correspondent in Argèles-sur-Mer (in southern France) reported on the circumstances of the ship being attacked, stating that the "Mar Cantabrico" was carrying 133 crew members and ten passengers, of whom only a Spaniard named Juan Pujol and another Italian were able to escape by swimming. Mr. Pujol was rescued by a French fishing boat after entering the water. According to his account, all the crew members and passengers of the "Mar Cantabrico," including Italians and people from various South American countries, were ordered to be shot by the captain of the "Canarias," without exception. Before the attack, the "Canarias" had ordered the "Mar Cantabrico" to stop immediately, but the "Mar Cantabrico" ignored it and continued to sail full speed ahead, intending to escape. The Canarias then opened fire, hitting the ship's side and immediately starting a fire, and sending out a radio distress signal. At this time, sailors from the Canarias boarded the Mar Cantabrico and took control. When nearby ships received the distress signal and came to rescue, they were rejected by the Canarias, saying that no assistance was needed. After boarding the ship, the sailors searched the crew and passengers, killing them on sight, without any mercy. The sound of gunshots was constant, and each gunshot meant the death of a companion. The scene was brutal and unimaginable. The place where I (Juan Pujol) was hiding was almost discovered. Although I was fortunate enough to escape, I still shudder when I recall the sound of gunfire.

### U.S. President Appeals to the People for Support of Judicial Reform

Judges Should Fulfill Their Judicial Duties - Should Not Interfere with Legislative Power

[Washington] President Roosevelt gave a special radio address to the nation tonight on the plan to reform the federal judicial system, saying that for four years, the actions of the Supreme Court have no longer been those of a judicial body, but have become those of a body that formulates national policy. We have endured this to this point and have no choice but to find a way to free the Constitution from the constraints of the Court. The actions of the Supreme Court must conform to the Constitution and not exceed its scope. The President further said that four years ago, when he first gave a radio address, the nation's banks were in a state of collapse, and the government ordered cash to be nationalized. Judging from today's recovery, it can be seen that the policy adopted was not wrong, but the Supreme Court at that time only ruled by a vote of five to four that the current nationalization law did not violate the Constitution. If there had been a difference of one vote, the national plan would have been hopeless. The four judges who voted against the law at that time even believed that private contracts to pay off debts by selling flesh were more sacred and inviolable than the goal of the American Constitution to establish the foundation of the nation. The function of the Constitution is to consolidate the foundation of the nation and promote the welfare of the people, so Congress has broad powers to levy taxes to achieve this goal. In modern times, laws are often made to seek progress in all aspects of society and the economy, but the Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected them, so that the laws passed by Congress to balance agricultural production, improve the lives of workers, protect commercial competition, and cultivate national resources must all be decided by the Supreme Court whether they should be implemented. The Court is in fact no different from an Upper Congress. The people of the country certainly want an independent judicial body, but it cannot be so independent as to not recognize universally recognized facts. The President also argued that although some people advocate amending the Constitution to seek reform, these people are also sufficient to obstruct the points that should be amended. The meaning of the Amendment to the Constitution must also be interpreted by the Supreme Court. As for the rumors that the President can appoint private individuals as judges, Roosevelt replied that he would be willing to appoint judges who do not overturn the decisions passed by Congress on legislative policy. In other words, he would be willing to appoint judges who can fulfill their judicial duties and not interfere with legislative power. Therefore, he advocated that the reform plan should be passed within the term of the current Congress so that the American judicial system can have progressive ideas as soon as possible.

### French National Defense Bond Bill Passed by the Chamber of Deputies

Right-Wing Amendment Rejected - Bonds to be Issued Today

[Paris] The government's bill on the issuance of national defense bonds and the amendment of the current monetary law, namely ① the current fixed buying, selling, exporting, and importing of gold can now be done freely, ② The government should compensate people who sold their gold to the government before the passage of this bill at a price lower than the current price. The Chamber of Deputies presented it for discussion this afternoon and passed it with a very large majority vote of 470 votes to 46 votes. It is expected that the Senate will also quickly approve it when it discusses it tomorrow. It is reported that the national defense bonds may be issued starting on the 11th of this month.

During the discussion in the Chamber of Deputies today, Prime Minister Blum gave a speech, requesting that the Chamber of Deputies unanimously pass the government's proposal. His words included: "The measures that the government should take are the urgent needs of our country at present, and not for the government's own sake. It is our common goal that these measures can be achieved as soon as possible. Therefore, the government specially appeals to all members of the Chamber of Deputies." After the Prime Minister finished speaking, members of various parties successively expressed their opinions, which are recorded separately below.

① Right-wing members, especially the leader of the Republican Federation, former Minister without Portfolio Marland, immediately proposed a reservation and continued to demand that members of all parties in Congress form a committee to supervise the use of national defense bonds. This amendment was ultimately rejected by the Chamber of Deputies by a vote of 367 votes to 136 votes. ② Central members, especially former Finance Minister Reno, former Navy Minister Petit, and former Prime Minister Flandin, although they criticized the government's general policies, all announced that they would vote in favor of national defense bonds. Renault briefly said that he firmly believed that the issuance of national defense bonds would be successful, but even this alone was not enough. The main problem at present lies in increasing production, so the government's economic policy should also be revised at the same time as the financial policy. Petit stated that he and his political allies agreed with the government's changes to fiscal policy, especially the reduction of 600 million francs in expenditures, and would naturally vote in favor. Flandin also said that he would vote in favor of national defense bonds and hoped that capitalists in Britain and the United States would subscribe to these bonds, but the interest on the bonds should be as low as possible so as not to compete with France's existing securities. ③ Left-wing members all supported the bill proposed by the government, especially the Vice-President of the Chamber of Deputies, Communist member Dugrolo, said that although the party criticized the restoration of freedom to the gold market, it would still vote in favor of the National Defense Bond Act. Ultra-left member Pécheré said that he hoped that the government would abide by the spirit of the Popular Front. Radical Socialist Party official Gambin also supported the bill proposed by the government on behalf of the party. Finally, the Chamber of Deputies voted to pass the government's bill.

### British Home Office Budget Increases Sharply

### Conference on Raw Materials Continues General Debate

Netherlands Declares Open-Door Policy in Its Colonies - U.S. Representative Strongly Advocates Free Trade Policy

[Geneva] The League of Nations Administrative Council's Committee on Raw Materials continued its general debate this afternoon, with Polish representative Rostosky giving a speech, stating that the availability of raw materials is a matter of life and death for Poland. Poland advocates that two subcommittees should be established to study the issue of raw material allocation from the financial and colonial perspectives, respectively. The representative of the Union of South Africa then spoke, supporting the claims of Sir Leith-Ross of Britain, and insisted that food should be included in the investigation, and said that for those who complain about the shortage of raw materials, it should be investigated whether their words are true, and whether the difficulties they feel are due to the policies implemented by other countries or their own countries. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 9th)

Then, Dutch representative Gerden gave a speech, stating that the Dutch government has always adopted an open-door policy in the Dutch East Indies. Dutch goods imported into the archipelago account for only 13% of the total imports, which is a lower percentage than any other country's colony that adopts an open-door policy. In addition, Japanese representative Shuto once proposed that there should be a fixed ratio between the amount of industrial imports and the amount of raw material exports as a standard, but the number of industrial products imported into the Dutch East Indies is far greater than the number of raw materials exported, which is contrary to the standard proposed by Shuto. The authorities of the Dutch East Indies had no choice but to take various appropriate measures to restore the balance of foreign trade and enable the colony's products to be sold. As for the financial policy adopted in the archipelago, it is more generous than other countries' colonies in terms of foreign investment. For example, the amount of Dutch investment in the island, excluding the sugar industry, accounts for only 62% of the total investment in the island, which is clear evidence.

Czech representative Pospisil then spoke, stating that the solution to the various difficulties of the current situation is to take gradual measures to restore free trade policy.

Then, U.S. representative Grady rose to speak, advocating that the current import quota system and preferential tariff system of various countries should be abolished, and all colonies should adopt an open-door policy. He also said that the reason why some countries have difficulty obtaining raw materials is often due to barter agreements.

Belgian representative Shearer then spoke, saying that since Britain, the United States, Germany, France, Italy, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Portugal, and Turkey signed the Berlin Treaty in 1885, establishing a free trade zone in various African territories, the Belgian Congo colony has always adopted an open-door policy, which should now be promoted to all colonies. As for the food issue, it should not be included in the agenda of this committee, because there has been no monopoly or shortage. In conclusion, he advocated that free trade policy should be restored immediately, and countries with sufficient capital should provide financial assistance to countries lacking capital so that they can purchase raw materials.

At this point, Assistant Director-General of the International Labour Office Morel spoke, supporting the British representative Sir Leith-Ross's opposition to the transfer of colonies belonging to various countries, and finally, Brazilian representative Muniz spoke, saying that the raw material issue is one of the most important issues of the League of Nations. If this issue can be resolved, most of the causes of war can be eliminated. Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 9th)

### Competing for Prime Minister in the House of Representatives Seats

Struggling Against the Rexist Party

⊙Brussels News Mr. Olivié, a Rexist Party member of the House of Representatives, resigned from his position as a representative of the capital region. The party leader, Degrelle, will also follow suit. It has been decided that when a by-election is held for the seat vacated by Olivié, he will stand as a candidate. Prime Minister Janson recently declared in the House of Representatives that he would compete with Degrelle as a joint candidate representing the three major government parties (namely the Catholic Party, the Socialist Party, and the Liberal Party). (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, September)

⊙Brussels News The Rexist Party, in an attempt to increase its number of seats in the House of Representatives, has decided to have its current members resign in succession, and then resign again after being re-elected. This cycle will continue in order to cause disruption and force a general election. The government, aware of this scheme, has submitted a bill to the House, arguing that members who leave office for reasons other than accidental ones, especially those who resign and then participate in by-elections in an attempt to cause disruption, should not have a by-election held. The House of Representatives debated this bill yesterday and passed it by a vote of 20 to 26. However, the law does not have retroactive effect, so it does not apply to the recent resignation of Rexist Party member Olivié in the capital region, and a by-election will still be held. Prime Minister Janson announced in the House yesterday that he would stand as a candidate to compete with the Rexist Party, stating that the government could have proposed a bill to abolish the by-election system altogether, but he believed it would be better for the government leader to stand as a candidate. He added, "My participation in this election does not represent any political party. I am only seeking a solution to revive the nation based on the will of the people." After the Prime Minister finished speaking, all members of the House, except for the Communist Party, the Flemish Nationalist Party, and the Rexist Party, applauded in approval.

### England Continues to Operate Aviation Services Between Penang and Hong Kong

[London] Viscount Swinton, the Secretary of State for Air, announced today the recommendation to continue the trial aviation service between Penang and Hong Kong. It is said that this service will continue to be handled until other arrangements are made for first-class mail to and from Hong Kong to be transported by air. Therefore, it is currently planned to conclude a contract with Imperial Airways to maintain the current route of Penang, Saigon, Hue (or Da Nang), and Hong Kong, with one flight per week to each location, for a period of twelve months from March 23 of this year. If other arrangements are made to connect the Hong Kong route with the Imperial Airways route, the contract may be cancelled with two weeks' notice. As for the temporary business subsidy, it will be a maximum of £12,500 per full year, and may be reduced if it is less than one year. The Hong Kong government has been asked to provide one-sixth of the funds. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, September 9)

### Taicang

Continuing to Request Exemption from Collection

The county's collection office for arrears in rent has been established for more than ten years. At that time, for every silver dollar collected from the renters, 15 cents were deducted for various public expenses, and 2 cents were deducted for warehouse start-up costs and 5 cents for security costs, totaling 12 cents per dollar. At that time, the original plans were all temporary in nature. However, up to today, they have not been cancelled. The rent collection is sluggish, and taxes are not being generated. Therefore, before the preparation of the county's 25th year local budget, the renters believed that the warehouse and security fees were an additional burden, lacking legal balance. Moreover, the security fee has always been listed under county tax items, and should be planned comprehensively within the county's local budget. Therefore, they repeatedly requested exemption in the state budget, but were not approved. At the time of preparing the 26th year budget, the renters continued to apply in order to alleviate the people's hardships.

### Changshu

Planning to Organize a Literature Exhibition
The Wu Chinese Literature Exhibition was held in Suzhou and achieved excellent results. It has now closed. The gentry in this area also had the motivation to hold a Haiyu Literature Exhibition. Because this county is known for its culture and is the hometown of Yan Zi, there are many historical sites and treasures in various collections. Currently, Qu Liangshi, a bibliophile from the Tieqin Tongjian Lou (Iron Zither Bronze Sword Pavilion), along with literati Zhang Yin Nan and Yan Zi's descendants, are planning to initiate the exhibition. The location is planned to be in the Zhishan Hall of the Shimei Reading Terrace. At that time, the Tieqin Tongjian Lou will display all of its treasured items. In addition, collections will be gathered from various places.

Tomb Relocation Unearths Artifacts

In order to build the Huanshan Road in this county, the tombs along the route must be relocated. Near the Tanglongfang outside Beidou, at an old tomb of the Jiang family, the engineering office instructed the owner to relocate it. However, their descendants were poor and only collected 15 legal tender dollars to start work. They then unearthed four coffins, all made of nanmu wood. Below, there was a pit containing two pairs of jade bowls, one gold ruyi, one inkstone tile, and one water bowl. Among them, the jade bowls and inkstone tile are the most valuable. It is said that the tomb belongs to Jiang Yuanshu of the Qing Dynasty, who served as the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi and the Taiwan Circuit. At that time, due to a mistake, he was dismissed and executed.

### Wuxi

Widening the Street Inside the North Gate

The previous county administration meeting decided to rebuild the Beiyuecheng (North Moon City), demolishing and rebuilding the old Yuecheng, increasing the height and widening the city gate, which would cost about 7,000 yuan. Also, widening the section of the street from Beiyuecheng Main Street to Fuxing Road would cost about 13,000 yuan, totaling more than 20,000 yuan. The county government has submitted this to the provincial government for approval and will allocate the funds from the municipal administration budget. However, the width of the road was previously set at eight meters, but some merchants in that section requested that it be changed to six meters, and the dispute has not been resolved. It is now planned to submit the actual situation to the Construction Committee for discussion and decision.

Investigation Reveals Huge Losses

The county government previously received a provincial order to thoroughly rectify the land tax and eliminate malpractices. A special investigation committee was formed and many investigators were recruited. Starting from July 1 of last year, the tax receipts from the 16th year of the Republic to the 24th year were investigated year by year. After eight months of work, it has recently been completed. According to the previous land tax director Zhu Kaiguan's report on the land prices and taxes for each year, from the date of collection to the date of the transfer of the investigation, the inventory of collected and uncollected receipts, the detailed verification of the listed collected and uncollected amounts, are generally consistent. However, the number of receipts checked and the number of receipts inventoried are very different, and there are shortages in each year. It is estimated that from the 17th year to the 24th year, the total loss is 97,169 yuan, 4 jiao, 7 fen, and 2 li of silver. In addition to reporting the detailed amount of losses over the years to the Provincial Department of Finance for review, County Magistrate Long ordered the former land tax director Zhu Kaiguan (currently the deputy manager of the Shanghai Fish Market) to be responsible for compensating the payment and to take measures to pay it as soon as possible.

Textile Industry Actively Expanding

This county's Shenxin, Qingfeng, Guangqin, Yukang and other textile factories have developed well last year and have made profits, which Qianfeng has never had before. In addition, Lixin, Zhenxin, Gengyu and other cloth factories also have surpluses. All factories are now actively expanding internally, resulting in a great shortage of existing female workers. Therefore, they are recruiting and training apprentices to train new workers to meet the needs. Lixin originally had more than 10,000 yarn spindles, but this year it decided to add more than 30,000 spindles. Gengyu Cloth Factory also added 30,000 spindles to engage in spinning. In addition, Xia Tieqiao, a local resident, raised 500,000 yuan to purchase 90 mu of land near Changyuan Bridge and established the Weixin Dyeing and Weaving Factory. It plans to purchase 150 cloth machines and start work on July 1.

### Suzhou

Zhang Zhongning was appointed to fill the vacancy. Zhang arrived in Suzhou on the 10th and will take over on the 16th.

### Yangzhou

Bandits Loot Xilai Town

In the ninth district of Jiangdu, Xilai Township, the main town, at about 4 PM on the afternoon of the eighth, more than 40 bandits suddenly arrived. Initially, eight or nine people participated in gambling in the town's teahouse, and then suddenly drew out pistols and shouted to prohibit gamblers from making noise, looting all the cash on hand. Then, they fired shots into the air to show their power. Both ends of the town street were cut off by bandits to prevent entry and exit. They went to various shops to search and loot for four hours. Chen, the wife of Xie Yongxiang, the owner of Lu Chen Hang, was shot in the right thigh. At about 8 PM, they began to transport the looted cloth, rice, wheat, clothing, and foreign ornaments onto three bandit ships parked at the river mouth, and left by water and land. In addition to Township Head Tu Zhiguo reporting to the Huang Jue Huai Ziliang Bridge Security Team for investigation, the County Bureau also sent detective team members Wei Xusheng and others to investigate. It is said that the bandits escaped to the Chenjia Village area in the northeast. In addition, the nun Tian Shun Yuanyun of the Shouzhen Nunnery in the township was severely injured by more than 30 bandits who poured kerosene on her and beat her. Tian Shun died en route after having her nipples burnt and getting injections in the city. Yuanyun stayed in the city for treatment, but her injuries were too severe and it was not easy to save her life.

### Gao You

Bandit Activity Rages Unabated

Recently, bandit activity in this county has raged unabated, with robberies occurring frequently. Wu Zhaoqi, who runs a general store in Jia 8, Bao 9, Zhahe Township, District 1, was robbed by eight or nine bandits of ten silver dollars, twenty strings of copper coins, and about a hundred dollars' worth of goods. Also, four bandits speaking with a scholar's accent came to the home of Yuan Er, a resident behind the Taisan Temple outside Beidou, at midnight on the seventh, and stole many items of clothing before escaping.

### Danyang

Construction of a Weir on the Central River

The Central River, which relates to water conservancy in both Zhenjiang and Danyang counties, has been the subject of dam construction disputes for many years, and has not yet been dredged. Responsible personnel from the two counties of Zhenjiang and Danyang held a special meeting last month. Attendees included Zhang Qingyuan, Magistrate of Zhenjiang County, Liu Yongnian, Director of the Bureau of Construction, Yu Qiuyuan, Section Chief of the Third Section of the Danyang County Government, and the District Chief of District 1. The general consensus was that dam construction on the river had repeatedly caused disputes in the past, and that the initial plan for dredging alone would not completely resolve the problem. Since Danyang is located downstream, the general public would find this difficult to accept. While conscription for labor would unlikely proceed smoothly, it would probably cause other disputes. It was immediately resolved that a request be submitted to the Department of Construction to plan the construction of a permanent rolling stone weir, and at the same time conscript labor to dredge and reorganize the river channel.

### Jiaxing

Meningitis Spreads More Widely

Cases of meningitis have occurred in Xian, Fengqiao, Shifosi, Wangdian, and other places in the southern countryside of Jiaxing. The county government and the Department of Civil Affairs have sent personnel to investigate and take measures for treatment. A disease prevention center has now been established in Fengqiao and other places to specialize in the prevention and treatment of meningitis. This disease has spread to the county seat. Many children over ten years old have died from meningitis. The course of the disease, from onset to death, is less than a day and a night. The Jiaxing Red Swastika Society has specially purchased vaccines and hired doctors for long-term injections. Residents who receive preventative shots are not charged a penny. Therefore, the number of people who come to the society for injections every day is quite high. Both Chinese and Western doctors are devising methods of prevention and announcing them to all the residents of the county to engage in prevention.

Continuing to Urge Payment of Old Taxes

The results of Jiaxing's collection of land taxes are quite good. More than 70% of the upper term land tax from the 25th year of the Republic has been recovered. Together with old taxes, more than 600,000 yuan has been collected. Now, the third term of old taxes is approaching the urging and collection period. The Department of Finance has specially dispatched Po Letian as a committee member to supervise the old taxes of the counties formerly under Jiaxing, so that he can supervise and urge payment nearby. Yan has already arrived in He the day before yesterday and set up an office to investigate the collection amounts over the years and the actual amount of debt currently owed by the people, so as to instruct the lenient collection personnel to start urging payment. However, this term is when the countryside is focusing on silkworm farming, and it is feared that there will be no surplus funds to pay the old taxes. It is expected that the success of this term's urging and collection will be inferior to the previous two terms.

### Hangzhou

Major Native Banks Close One After Another

In Hangzhou, since the big settlement this term, the native banks that have closed down because shareholders are unwilling to continue operating include Tongde and Jiekang. Now, Yiyuan Native Bank has also released four or five thousand yuan in accounts receivable in Yuhang and other places last year, which cannot be recovered, and the person in charge of the bank has also lost about 30,000 yuan, so it has officially announced the cessation of business and liquidation. Deposits will be refunded in advance. Also, Renhe Pig Trading Company, which has been operating in Jianggan for more than ten years with annual turnover of about 200,000 to 300,000, has also announced its closure because it was owed more than 20,000 yuan by bankrupt butchers and was unable to sustain operations. It may be reorganized and operated by shareholders who invest more capital.

### Xiaoshan

The Qiantang River Rises and the Dike is in Danger

Since the beginning of spring, it has been raining continuously. Mountain floods in the You, Jinqu, and Yan areas of the Qiantang River have broken out, causing the water level of the Qiantang River to rise sharply. Recently, the water standard point of the Sanlang Temple in the Qiantang River has risen to 3.95 meters. Goods from all parts of the upper river are drifting along the water. In the eastern countryside and the Ximu Township of the fifth and seventh districts of Xiaoshan County, more than one million mu of newly grown sandbanks have been collapsing day and night due to the rapid flow of the river, and the situation is quite fierce. The dike bank suddenly appears to be in danger. The dike body in the fifth and sixth districts along the Qiantang River on the north bank is also in imminent danger. The Hangzhou Sand Protection Association has sent a letter to the district chiefs of the fifth and sixth districts to investigate and assist, and to supervise the strong men to plan the emergency rescue. Mayor Zhou Xiangxian also personally went to inspect the dike bank, and convened gentry and the district chiefs of the fifth and sixth districts to discuss emergency rescue matters.

### Mayor Wu's 50th Birthday Acknowledgment

According to the Central News Agency, the 9th of this month was Mayor Wu Tiecheng's 50th birthday. All sectors of the city felt that Wu had been the mayor of Shanghai for five years and had experienced countless dangers and difficulties, and had made many contributions to culture, economy, and society, and planned to hold a celebration on that day to express their respect. However, Wu was humble and did not want to be extravagant, and repeatedly dissuaded them in advance, and even avoided going elsewhere on the day. However, many leaders from all sectors of the city and Wu's friends still went to Wu's residence to leave notes and pay their respects. Wu felt that their kindness was touching, so he drafted a letter of thanks in response. The original letter is excerpted as follows: The other day was Tiecheng's 50th birthday. Because the country is in difficulty and the people's livelihood is exhausted, I have spent half my life in vain and have made no achievements. Therefore, I have strictly warned my family in advance not to take any action, lest it disturb relatives and friends. However, I am grateful to the colleagues in the press and friends from all sides for their kind congratulations and excessive praise. In addition to feeling grateful, I only increase my sense of guilt. Tiecheng serves the party and the country and is a public servant. I have little talent and am ashamed to have made no contribution. However, I am fortunate not to have failed, thanks to the guidance of the party and the government and our leaders, as well as the guidance of people from all walks of life and the assistance of my colleagues. If there is any honor, it should be attributed to the country and the leaders. The ancients said, "At the age of fifty, one knows the faults of the forty-nine years." From now on, Tiecheng can only work harder and hope to contribute a little, so as not to disappoint the expectations of all circles.

### The Liangzhe Salt Affairs Tax Police Bureau Investigates Yuyao Private Boards

Please Assist the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association

The Shanghai Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association received a letter from the Liangzhe Salt Affairs Tax Police Bureau yesterday, which stated: "To the respected Association, the number of private boards in Yuyao Salt Field of Liangzhe Salt Transport is too large. It is stipulated that the number of boards will be investigated on March 15th, and our bureau is assigned to carry out the investigation. The factory bureau has the special responsibility of protecting taxes and suppressing smuggling. Since we have received the command of the Salt Transport, we cannot shirk it. However, this matter is of great importance, and at the beginning of the implementation, we are deeply afraid that various parties will misunderstand and cause disputes. We have attached a letter to the Salt Bureau notifying all salt farmers in the field and request that you examine it and widely publicize it.

### International Trade Association Initiates Japanese Embassy Paper Weaving China Travel Association

Aimed at attracting foreigners to travel in China, inviting presidents of various ministries and prominent figures from all walks of life to initiate.

The China International Trade Association, in order to attract people from various countries to travel in China, thereby increasing revenue from our country's tourism industry, offsetting trade deficits, spreading our country's culture, and promoting international understanding, is imitating the existing methods of European and American countries and Japan to initiate the organization of the China Travel Association. Yesterday, it sent letters to the presidents of various ministries and commissions, as well as the mayor of this city, Wu Tiecheng, and prominent figures from all walks of life, Yu Zhiqing, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Xinliu, Lin Kanghou, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, etc., to be the initiators. After the association is established, it plans to jointly promote China's scenic spots abroad in conjunction with China Travel Service, various transportation agencies, companies, and businesses, and to improve travel facilities domestically and facilitate domestic travel.

Its declaration says: In recent years, China has suffered from the fluctuations of the world economic panic from the outside and the devastation of natural and man-made disasters from the inside. The outflow of silver, the exhaustion of finance, the cities have fallen into poverty, and the rural areas are on the verge of bankruptcy. The balance of international payments has been in deficit for many years, and the problem of trade deficits has become increasingly serious. The whole country, from top to bottom, almost universally wants to quickly extricate itself from the abyss of economic panic. Therefore, efforts are being made to adjust in various aspects. The government has implemented the reform of the monetary gold standard and promoted the construction of central and local areas. The people are also working diligently and urgently seeking the development of production industries to achieve self-sufficiency in various commodities, increase exports, and make up for trade deficits. This is indeed gratifying. However, looking at the efforts of all parties, most of them are biased towards increasing tangible trade in order to offset the deficit in the balance of international payments. Insufficient attention has been paid to intangible exports. As for

Intangible Exports The tourism industry is especially neglected by all parties. Attracting foreigners to travel in one's own country can not only allow foreigners to consume their daily necessities in one's own country, buy more of one's own country's products, and thus increase the income of the entire population of one's own country, but also allow foreigners to have a deeper understanding of one's own country's culture and customs, eliminate all misunderstandings and superficial views, and thus enhance friendship between countries. Its benefits are enormous. Therefore, in modern times, all countries regard the tourism industry as the most important enterprise of the country and do their best to promote it. Switzerland originally

Tourism Industry is the economic foundation of the country, advocating the most vigorously. France, Germany, the United States, Italy, and other countries are also catching up quickly. Canada, Cuba, Mexico, and the United States in the Americas have not had much time to read. Japan, India, and Vietnam in the East have also caught up, sparing no effort in promotion. Examining the methods of promotion in various countries, it is nothing more than the joint efforts of the government and the people, each with donations, uniting the railway, shipping, and hotel industries, striving to improve to suit the rich, and making widespread publicity and detailed guidance. Speaking of the results, the people who come to visit, supporting the old and carrying the young, scrambling forward for fear of falling behind, number in the thousands and tens of thousands. The income from this kind of business in various countries is

Counted in the Tens of Billions Not only is it enough to offset the deficit in the balance of international payments, but it can also prosper the economy of the entire nation. But try to ask the cost of its promotion, it is not worth a trace of the benefits obtained from the promotion. Our country has vast land, abundant products, and scenic spots everywhere. The palaces of Beiping and the lakes and mountains of Hangzhou have long been well-known. The holy land of Qufu, the ancient sites of Chang'an, the seaside of Qingdao, and the appearance of Mount Lu have also been praised by China and foreign countries. As for the landscape of Guilin, the climate of Kunming, the Buddhist forest of Mount Emei, and the waterfalls of Yandang, they have gradually attracted the attention of foreigners. The prosperity of Shanghai and the splendor of Guangzhou have long been in the minds of foreigners. Other things such as the long-standing culture and the simplicity of the people are also worthy of foreign research and understanding. Therefore, looking around the country, there is almost no place that cannot make foreigners

Linger and Forget to Return Also, there is nothing that cannot make foreigners spend money to buy. Based on this, the income that our country obtains from the tourism industry alone should be extremely huge. However, based on the past international balance of payments estimates, it can be known that the amount is very small. There is no way to compare it with Western countries. Even compared to India and Japan in the East, it is inferior. The reason for this is that our country's government and people have not been able to actively promote it. Examining the key elements for the development of the tourism industry, in addition to the beautiful natural environment, it should be the convenience of transportation facilities, the comfort of hotel arrangements, the courteous service of servants, the uniformity of national product prices, and the widespread official transmission abroad and the guidance of groups. In our country, all these things are either still in need of improvement, or they are

All Need Creation However, without a central organization to make detailed plans and provide unified command, both improvement and creation will be impossible to start. Governments and people in advanced countries almost all have this kind of organization, such as the Japan Tourism Bureau, the Swiss National Tourist Office, the German Tourism Promotion Association, and the Italian National Tourism Department. Although the names are different, the nature is the same. We are deeply aware of the profound economic panic and the backwardness of our country's tourism industry, and we are impressed by the effectiveness of the promotion of the tourism industry in various countries. Therefore, we have organized the Tourism Association, hoping to bring together various institutions related to the national tourism industry and Chinese and foreign people who have a special interest in the tourism industry,

United and Consistent Working together to improve domestic facilities and promote and guide abroad, etc., and hoping that women who come to our country to visit will feel convenient and comfortable in any aspect. Furthermore, we hope that the number of visitors will increase day by day, so that the people can obtain huge incomes, the national conditions can be accurately understood, the feelings between China and foreign countries can become more harmonious, and our country's international status and economic situation can also be increased and improved by this. After the organization of this association is completed, it is also planned to promote the travel of Chinese people at home and abroad to the best of our ability.

Encourage Because the majority of our country's people still lack noble entertainment, and when they occasionally have leisure, they mostly indulge in improper enjoyment. The result is not only useless but also harmful. To correct this mistake, promoting travel is the best way. Traveling is enough to enable the people to change to a new environment and increase new spirit and new strength after being busy with work, and then engage in their careers. Moreover, if the people often travel in the country, the residents of the countryside can understand the prosperity of the cities, and the residents of the cities can deeply understand the simplicity of the countryside. When inspecting the border towns and visiting scenic spots and historical sites, they can understand the long history, profound culture, and great construction of our country, and thus increase their

Love for the Motherland Enthusiasm, in visiting various industrial and commercial organizations, political academics, and social institutions, can also recognize the reality of our country in all aspects, and thus increase the knowledge that is necessary for them. This is extremely beneficial to the people themselves and the future of the country. As for letting the people travel abroad, the stones from other mountains can be used to polish jade. Our country is undergoing modernization in the process. There are many things that we want to learn from advanced countries. If the people have gained something abroad, they will be able to improve their careers after returning to the country, and the country will actually benefit from it. In short, the promotion of the tourism industry is necessary in today's China. Whether foreigners come to China to travel, Chinese people go abroad to travel, or Chinese people travel in the country, it is all beneficial and harmless to our country. We are deeply convinced of the extreme value of this kind of work, and we dare to jointly initiate it and work hard to achieve something. We hereby declare, hoping that our fellow countrymen will jointly plan for it.

### Opening Ceremony of the Military Attaché Office of the Japanese Embassy

Military Attaché Kita Presides Over Everything

The Japanese Embassy in China has built a military attaché office at the intersection of Tihui Road and Qicha Road. Construction began in September last year and has been completed. Yesterday afternoon, the opening ceremony was held in the new building. Military attachés stationed in various places such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao came to Shanghai a few days ago to participate. Military Attaché Kita presided over everything and invited Chinese and foreign people from this port to participate. As for the rumors that the Japanese military attaché will hold a meeting in Shanghai, the representative of the information office of the Japanese Embassy claimed that it was a misrepresentation. There is currently no preparation to convene a meeting. However, when military attachés from various places gathered in Shanghai to meet Military Attaché Kita, they would naturally report the situation in various places. Military attachés from various places will stay in Shanghai for a while and then return to their respective posts.

### San Francisco Immigration Commissioner Cahill Describes the Reasons for American Resistance to Chinese Labor

Preventing and Reducing Wages in the US; Difficult for Quota Movement to Pass

The mainland newspaper reported that Mr. Cahill, the San Francisco District Immigration Commissioner who also handles naturalization matters, and his wife returned to San Francisco from the Philippines on the President Hoover. When they passed through Shanghai on Tuesday, they talked to a reporter from the mainland newspaper about the reasons why American laborers are striving to maintain the current immigration laws that exclude Chinese people from entering the country, saying that American laborers are deeply afraid that the entry of low-value workers will reduce their wages. Therefore, they have tried their best to resist Eastern immigrants from entering the United States in the past. There are also quotas for European immigrants entering the United States. In recent years, due to the economic downturn, laborers have struggled to maintain their wages in order to avoid further reductions, and they are working harder than before. Their organizations are also more complete, so that the wages they earn are enough to purchase daily necessities. In addition, laborers are all worried about unemployment. There are still as many as 9 million unemployed people in the United States, and 1 million young people graduate from school every year to seek employment. These two reasons have made the American labor resistance line more consolidated. Although the number of Europeans and non-Europeans allowed to enter the United States is limited to 154,000 people per year, only 32,000 people were allowed to enter last year. The number of people who can enter this year is approximately only 16,000 people. All others who apply for entry are rejected due to the strict regulations promulgated by the State Council, because of various reasons for verifying physical fitness and financial resources. Now, every immigrant must hold approximately 1,700 US dollars before they are eligible to enter the country. When the reporter asked if there was any hope for setting a quota for Eastern immigrants, Mr. Cahill replied that he heard that some people are now campaigning for this matter. The current Congress may propose this matter, but because the labor party strongly opposes it, there is little hope for this kind of bill to pass. I would like to express my gratitude for the good spirit of the Chinese people. The Chinese people have no complaints about the measures taken by the immigration officials to implement the law. They know that they can only do their duties in a reasonable way and have no right to change the law.

### Crew of Ning Shao Company Opposes Salary Reduction

Shipping Engineers Association and others submit requests for assistance from party and government agencies.

The entire crew of the Ning Shao Commercial Shipping Company opposed the salary reduction of the crew of the Ning Jing Wheel. They sent separate letters to the driving and maritime workers' union and the shipping engineers' association, etc., to quickly negotiate with the capitalists and demand the immediate restoration of the original salaries of all the crew of the Ning Jing Wheel. The association, etc., in order to protect the interests of its members, seek the happiness of its members, and hope that labor and capital will cooperate sincerely, hopes that the capitalists will immediately realize this in order to avoid unfortunate twists and turns. Therefore, it has submitted a request to the party and government authorities to strictly prevent salary reduction behavior, immediately restore the original salaries, and earnestly protect the positions of the crew members and not make any changes without reason.

### Municipal Police Bureau Checks Smokers

Those Who Have Relapsed After Quitting Will Be Punished According to Law

According to Da Gong She, in order to prevent smokers from relapsing after quitting and to completely eliminate opium addiction, the Municipal Police Bureau has specially stipulated that the first batch of 2,000 smokers who have quit smoking will be selected for random checks, and entrusted the Longhua Temporary Drug Rehabilitation Center and the Zhabei Opium Addiction Hospital to conduct the checks. Since the beginning of this month, the Municipal Police Bureau has ordered various branches and districts to notify smokers, and they have been going to respond to the checks in crowded numbers in recent days. The second round is scheduled to begin at the beginning of next month, and more than 18,000 smokers who have registered to quit will be checked one by one.

Punishing Relapsed Smokers According to Chief Ye of the Registration Section of the Fourth Division of the Bureau, the purpose of the Bureau's handling of random checks of smokers is to prevent the abuse of those who have quit and have relapsed. The hospitals responsible for the random checks will report the results of the smokers' random checks to the Bureau every day. If it is found that any smokers who have quit have relapsed, the Bureau will punish them in accordance with the Provisional Bamboo Regulations for Punishing Opium Addiction promulgated by the Military Commission, and will never condone them.

Implementing Joint Liability Since the implementation of the city's anti-opium work, propaganda and persuasion have been carried out simultaneously. Although the situation is complicated, it is no more than a city where Chinese and foreigners live together, and the results are very significant. However, in order to eliminate opium addicts and drug offenders within the time limit, the joint liability system has been implemented. If an unlicensed opium addict is found to be residing in the urban area and the landlord conceals it and does not report it, once arrested, the landlord will be punished in the same way as the opium addict.

The following is a record of the Reserve Association's business report and the Acceptance House's business report.

Business Report of the Reserve Association

The Joint Reserve Committee's 1936 Business Report stated: Politics and economics are closely related. This year's situation, such as Sino-Japanese diplomacy and the Xi'an Incident, was sufficient to affect finance. Fortunately, the panic of "lack of chips" in the past has now been eliminated, so we are safe and sound. If it had occurred before the implementation of the new monetary policy, the degree of tension would have been higher than today. Rumors of capital flight often deafened the ears. However, although the price of gold and foreign currencies was occasionally high, it soon returned to stability due to the strict management of the National Bank. Other factors, such as the abundance of agricultural products, the rebound in prices, the increase in industrial and commercial production, and the reduction in international import surpluses, as demonstrated by the facts and reflected in reports from various parties, are now sufficient to prove the progress of the national economy. Although its reflection in the Shanghai financial community is not yet significant, real estate transactions, which account for an important part of investment, remain stagnant. However, it can be asserted that the general market situation has shown signs of turning, and the increase in the Association's exchange volume is one proof of this. Our colleagues in the industry operate prudently, each consolidating their foundation, allowing the market to begin calmly and then become lively. Their painstaking efforts are conceivable. At the beginning of this year, the Association, in view of the urgent need to promote bill acceptance and spot cash, established the Bank Acceptance House to handle the acceptance and discounting of bills of exchange, so that industry funds can be used flexibly. In the past five years, the Association has taken the lead in joint reserves, the planning and establishment of the Clearing House, and gradual promotion, relying on the supervision of colleagues in the industry and responding to the needs of the times. All planned projects have been gradually implemented and have achieved results. This is somewhat comforting to our colleagues in the industry. In the future, how should the Association adapt to the environment and needs, improve efficiency, and strive to fulfill its service responsibilities? We still hope that our colleagues in the industry will provide guidance at any time so that we may have something to follow, and we are infinitely hopeful. At the end of 1936, in addition to the Bank Acceptance House providing a separate report in accordance with regulations, we hereby report the main points of the business situation over the past year as follows:

(A) Department of Joint Reserves: (1) Reserve Assets: The total number of reserve assets deposited by each bank, according to the year-end financial statement, is 60,001,338.90 national currency, which is slightly lower than the number at the end of the previous year. This is because the market price of real estate in the reserve assets has changed slightly. This year, the evaluation committee re-evaluated strictly, so the numbers are difficult to see a reduction, and the content is more factual. The total amount of all reserves was 59.98% of the total evaluation amount in the first half of the year and 60.91% of the total evaluation amount in the second half of the year. According to the number of the financial statement in the second half of the year, real estate accounts for 82% of the total amount, foreign marketable securities account for 11.75%, domestic government bonds account for 5%, and cash accounts for 0.25%. (2) Promissory Notes and Call Loans: In addition to being used as various reserves, the promissory notes received by each bank, including the public promissory notes, can be used to offset call loans or remit funds to the Association. The total amount of public promissory note call loans in the first half of the year was 44,454,000 national currency, which is an increase of 24,260,000 yuan compared to the first half of 1935. The total amount of public promissory note call loans in the second half of the year was 56,670,000 national currency, which is a decrease of 51,360,000 yuan compared to the second half of 1935. The trend of decreasing public promissory note call loans is because the Association's Bank Acceptance House was established in March of this year, and each bank has the convenience of accepting and discounting bills of exchange. The original public promissory note call loans are now partly converted into bill of exchange acceptance and discounting. After the implementation of the new monetary policy, the chips are abundant, the finance is loose, and the need for call loans is also reduced. The Association's public promissory note call loan interest rate is usually 10% per annum, and the call loan interest rate is usually around 8%, with very little change, which proves the stability of the market. (3) Acceptance Bill Discount: Each bank holds bills of exchange accepted by the Association's Bank Acceptance House, which can be discounted at any time to the member banks of the Acceptance House or the Association. Among colleagues, funds can have appropriate turnover. During the year, the total discount of acceptance bills by the Association was 4,660,000 national currency. At the end of the year, the amount that had not yet expired was 2,530,000 national currency. The Association's acceptance bill discount rate, based on 90-day bills, averaged 11.19% per annum. (4) Clearing Deposits: The average daily amount of clearing bank deposits this year was 95,914,000 national currency, which is an increase of more than 11,790,000 yuan compared to the average daily amount of the previous year. The total year-end deposit balance was more than 98,849,000 yuan, of which clearing deposits accounted for 39.68% and remittance deposits accounted for 60.32%. The ratio of clearing differences to clearing deposits averaged 1/6. (5) Profit and Loss: The total revenue from loan interest for the year was 200,896.15 yuan, plus 37,240.98 yuan from call loan interest, discount interest, and other income, totaling 246,208.13 yuan. The budget for the expenses of the Reserve Department this year was 24,720 yuan, and the financial statement was 25,674.62 yuan, which exceeded the budget by 954.62 yuan. After deducting the total amortization of equipment of 8,017.76 yuan, the net profit after offsetting profit and loss was 212,515.75 yuan.

(B) Department of Bill Exchange: (1) Exchange Banks: Because the seats in the Exchange House were full, the Association was temporarily unable to arrange for banks applying to join the exchange this year. The Executive Committee specially stipulated that member banks of the Bankers Association who are unable to join as exchange banks due to the limited location of the Exchange House may entrust the Association to act as an agent for exchange and collection of bills. In January of this year, six banks, including Zhejiang Local, Sichuan Meifeng, Jiangsu Provincial Farmers, China Farmers, Yongda, and Pudong, successively entrusted the Association to act as an agent for exchange and collection of bills. On January 28, the Central Bank joined the Association as a Yuanhao exchange bank. From the same day, the collection and settlement of the Association's exchange bank customers were handled jointly by the Central, China, and Communications Banks, and a joint office of the Central, China, and Communications Banks was established in the Association. On September 1, the Sichuan-Kang Colonial Bank and the Agricultural and Commercial Bank simultaneously entrusted the Association to act as an agent for exchange and collection of bills. On November 2, the Zhonghui and Jiangzhe banks in the Association's exchange banks merged their operations, and the exchange house number of Jiangzhe Bank was eliminated due to the merger. On December 1, the China Farmers Bank changed from a trust agent exchange bank to an exchange bank to fill the vacancy of Jiangzhe Bank. In addition, eleven branches of each bank established in the city successively joined the exchange this year. (2) Exchange Volume: The total exchange volume for the year was 5,984,300,080.71 national currency, with 2,578,913 bills. Compared with the previous year, the amount increased by 61.05% and the bills increased by 38.71%. The increase in the exchange volume this year can be attributed to the joining of the Central Bank in the exchange and the expansion of the Association's agency exchange scope. The average daily exchange volume was 20,149,000 national currency, with 8,683 bills. On February 31, the exchange amount reached 195,253,052.31 yuan, and on April 14, the exchange bills reached 24,261, both of which were the highest records since the exchange was held. Comparing the monthly amounts, the daily average in May was more than 16 million yuan, March and August were both more than 17 million yuan, February, April, July, and September were all more than 18 million yuan, January and November were both more than 12 million yuan, and October and December averaged more than 24 million yuan per day. The ratio of the annual exchange difference to the total exchange amount, calculated by combining clearing and remittance, averaged 11.67%, a decrease of 1.69% from the previous year. (3) Collection of Bills: Since the Association started handling the collection of bills in mid-June of the previous year, after several months of training, all procedures have become proficient by the beginning of this year, and the service efficiency has become more significant. The total number of collections this year was 1,455,457,124.06 yuan, with 1,242,703 bills, averaging 4,111,000 yuan and 3,511 bills per day. On December 31, the collection amount reached 14,169,836.73 yuan, which was the highest record this year. On October 1, the collection of bills reached 10,880, which was the highest record since the collection was handled. In the total amount of collections throughout the year, remittance and money house payable funds accounted for 57.68% of the total amount, silver and money industry payable funds outside the Bankers Association accounted for 23.56%, and various shops or merchants outside the silver and money industry accounted for 18.76%. As for the money industry's receipt of bills from the Association's exchange banks, with each bank issuing checks to the Association, and the Central, China, and Communications Banks reconciling accounts with the money industry's reserve bank, the total number for the year was 1,376,499,938.28 yuan, averaging 3,888,000 yuan per day.

Acceptance House Report

The Bank Acceptance House's 1936 Business Report stated: The backbone of the modern financial market is bill acceptance and discount. The history of our country's modern financial organization is relatively shallow. Shanghai is the financial center of the country, but acceptance bills and other borrowing tools have not yet taken root. Banks mostly provide funds to industry and commerce in the form of mortgage loans. Before the due date, this type of mortgage loan cannot be circulated through discounting. Once there is a financial crunch, there is no room for turnover and financing of sluggish book debts. As a result, bank funds sometimes feel lacking. In the past few years, due to the concentration of funds in urban areas, financial relaxation, and loose market conditions, since 1935, the abnormal prosperity has turned into frank embarrassment. In June of that year, the market was extremely tight, which was unprecedented. Our colleagues in the industry usually operate steadily. Although the difficult times have passed, and they are breathing a little easier, in order to seek development for themselves and to plan for the revitalization of the market, they entrusted the Association to plan the establishment of a bill acceptance house. At that time, a committee was organized to start discussing methods. After several months and five or six meetings, various rules and regulations were drafted, but they were delayed until the end of the year due to obstacles and were not implemented. At the beginning of this year, the financial stagnation was still the same as before. Colleagues deeply felt that the promotion of acceptance bills should not be delayed any longer, so they re-studied and decided to set up a Bank Acceptance House in the Association, with the scope of serving colleagues. On February 20, the 14th Committee Bank Representatives Meeting passed the articles of association and covenant drafts, and sent them to the Bankers Association for approval and filing. At the same time, the Executive Committee actively prepared for the signing of contracts, the raising of funds, the completion of various detailed rules, and the arrangement of venues and the allocation of personnel. The preparations were completed on March 16, and an announcement was made on the same day to establish and start work. A total of 38 member banks joined, paying up a total of 7,613,750 national currency in acceptance funds, of which 5% was deposited in cash in the House, and the remaining 95% was deposited in the original paying bank, agreeing that the total amount of acceptance was 30,495,000 national currency. Afterwards, each bank successively deposited acceptance collateral in the House. By the beginning of April, each bank had begun to sell and hand over to the House for acceptance, and discount transactions were implemented among colleagues. As of the end of the year, the various businesses were proceeding smoothly. The Association aims to serve the industry, and the acceptance of bank bills is intended to make the funds of colleagues flexible. Since there are no previous rules in the country, all facilities are created from scratch, and expansion and improvement are still to come. We sincerely hope that our colleagues in the industry will not hesitate to give guidance, so that the House can provide soil and fine streams in the development process of each colleague, and then we will be grateful. At the end of 1936, we hereby report the main points of the business situation over the past year as follows: (1) Acceptance Collateral: The total amount of acceptance collateral deposited by each bank, according to the year-end financial statement, is 3,867,368 national currency. The acceptance amount accounts for 71.34% of the total evaluation amount of the collateral. According to the year-end financial statement, marketable government bonds, company bonds, bills, and stocks account for 50.01% of the total amount, real estate in the city accounts for 20.71%, domestic commercial paper accounts for 18.2%, the Association's promissory notes account for 6.48%, and domestic goods account for 4.69%. (2) Acceptance Bills: The total number of bills issued by each bank and accepted by the House during the year was 84, totaling 4,020,000 national currency. The number of acceptance bills of the House that have expired this year is 27, totaling 1,340,000 national currency. The number of bills that have not yet expired at the end of the year is 57, totaling 1,680,000 national currency. The average term of the bills is mostly 90 days. The acceptance amount is delivered to the House by the issuing bank one day before the bill expires. There were no expired bills extended throughout the year. (3) Discount Transactions: The sale and purchase of acceptance bills of the House are temporarily limited to member banks. The House acts as an agent for contact every day. If there is a sale but no purchase on the same day, the Association may discount it, and then sell it again when needed. The total number of discount transactions of acceptance bills of the House this year was 6,710,000 national currency, of which 4,660,000 yuan was discounted by the Association, and 2,050,000 yuan was discounted by each member bank. The acceptance bill discount rate, based on 90-day bills, averaged 11.9% per annum. (4) Profit and Loss: From March to December of this year, the income from acceptance handling fees and interest totaled 8,327.15 yuan. The budget for the expenses of the acceptance portion of the year, calculated from March to the end of the year, was 8,000 yuan for ten months. The financial statement was 5,007.69 yuan, which was 2,992.11 yuan less than the budget. After deducting the total amount of start-up costs of 1,908.14 yuan, the net profit after offsetting profit and loss was 1,411.32 national currency, which is planned to be fully included in the surplus for rollover.

### The Lawyers Association Suggests Improving the Judiciary

Vigorously Implement Oral Petitions, Quickly Handle Preservation Measures, and Deliberate on the Amount of Guarantee

The Shanghai Lawyers Association submitted a document to the Jiangsu High Court and the courts at all levels in the region where its members practice law, stating that it was a request. It stated that Article 426 of the Civil Procedure Law stipulates that a lawsuit, a request for mediation, and statements or representations outside the date of the hearing may be made orally. Last year's judicial conference also resolved to adopt the proposal that oral prosecution should be vigorously implemented in civil simple cases, and the Ministry of Justice adopted it. Subsequently, the Ministry of Justice issued Instruction No. 6137, ordering the courts under its jurisdiction to earnestly implement it. At present, the above-mentioned methods have not been implemented in the Shanghai courts, and the parties to the lawsuit feel inconvenienced. It seems that the local courts should be requested to implement them quickly and announce detailed methods for oral petitions and lawsuits. Secondly, the lack of provisions for provisional attachment and provisional injunction in civil cases is intended to preserve the creditor's compulsory execution. Therefore, the most important thing in handling such cases is speed. If the handling is slightly delayed, the debtor will have already escaped after hearing the news, or has already disposed of or concealed the property, so that the creditor's claim cannot be preserved, which violates the original purpose of the preservation procedure. At present, the Shanghai courts have failed to handle such cases quickly, so it should be requested to formulate effective and prompt methods. A deadline should be clearly set for matters such as copying and delivery, in order to be fast and achieve the purpose of the preservation procedure. In addition, regarding provisional attachment and provisional injunction cases, the court clearly orders the creditor to provide security. The amount of security should be determined by the court in accordance with its authority. However, the court does not consider whether the debtor has any actual possibility of damage. For example, in a rent case, the landlord applies for provisional attachment in order to avoid the tenant escaping the rent, and the number of securities ordered to be provided is often equal to the object of the request. This is nothing more than to protect the interests of the tenant in the court, but for the landlord, the claim has already been in danger, and he must provide a huge amount of security, and in fact, he is overwhelmed. It seems that the Junyuan should be requested to consider the actual situation, take into account the interests of both parties, etc. The meeting was submitted to the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, and it was resolved that it should be forwarded to the courts for adoption, etc. In addition to submitting it separately, it is urgently submitted to the Junyuan for review and adoption, which is convenient for the public.

### The Patriotic Goods Promotion Association of Citizens Completes the Filing Procedures

As soon as it is completed, a general meeting of all members will be convened to re-elect the executive and supervisory committee members to start working.

### American Female Explorer Arrives in Shanghai

Cleese Makris Licks Her Life's Adventures, Now Retired from Exploration for Leisure

The Continental News reported that Mrs. Cleese Makris, an English woman, began traveling and exploring after the death of her husband, Mr. Kirk, fourteen years ago. There is no place she has not been to. Her travel books, written under the name of Mrs. Cleese Makris, have been read by millions of readers. Later, she married Mr. Fischer, so she is now renamed Mrs. Fischer. Mr. Fischer also likes to travel very much. Recently, the couple traveled together, passing through Mandalay, Burma, Yunnan, India, and now they have arrived in Shanghai. According to Mrs. Fischer, who told the Continental News reporter that she has retired from exploration and is now traveling for leisure. She and her husband travel to foreign countries every year. The most recent trip took forty days, sometimes by boat, sometimes on foot, sometimes with a mule train, and sometimes flying in an airplane. After a short stay in Shanghai, they plan to return to London via Moscow and plan the itinerary for next year's trip. Mrs. Fischer also mentioned the dangers she encountered during her travels, saying, "I was attacked by wolves in Western Siberia, and I was once trapped in a glacier. The situation was very difficult. I have several bullet and arrow scars on my body. The one on my nose was received in the Azalea Desert. I also have a knife wound on my waist. Several years ago, every time I went to South America, there was a revolution there. But when people are in danger, they are calm. Every time I go to a place, I am not discouraged by the dangers. I remember once when I wanted to enter Russia, I couldn't because there were soldiers patrolling the border. So I entered the Arctic region, hired four Lapps from Lapland as guides, and traveled by reindeer sled for sixty-seven days before finally entering Russia. The most dangerous of my travels was contracting tropical fever in the Amazon River in South America. The reason was partly because I had to climb the Andes Mountains, which were 17,000 feet high, so I reduced the weight of the food I carried, which made the situation weak, and partly because the Czech youth who was traveling with me shot himself in the head with a pistol and died, which was caused by shock. Before the Italian-Ethiopian War was about to break out, I traveled to Addis Ababa and dined with the Ethiopian Emperor. Then, escorted by an Ethiopian guard, I traveled 1,200 miles by freight car to enter British Kenya. I have traveled from Cairo, Egypt, to the Cape of Good Hope, and I have also hunted in the Rocky Mountains of the United States and the Himalayas, and I have also entered Tibet with merchant caravans. I have visited almost all the historical sites in various countries that you can mention." ×××

### Song Amao Stabbed to Death for Only Three Yuan and Fifty Cents

The Murderer Confessed to the Murder After Failing to Recover Debt. The Police Filed a Public Prosecution for Murder

Song Amao, a 34-year-old man from Ningbo, used to be a carpenter and recently worked as a vendor. He and his wife, Song Zhang氏, lived in the Fulaike Inn at No. 43 Mantingfang, Wuhu Road. Unfortunately, at around 1 p.m. the day before yesterday, he had a dispute with his friend Wang Rongzhang over money, which led to a feud. Wang then used a sharp blade to stab Song six times at the entrance of the inn, including one in the left breast, sternum, left ribs, left arm, right shoulder, and left thigh. Wang did not escape and was immediately seized by Song's wife, Zhang, and handed over to the patrol officer, who took him to the Laozha Police Station under its jurisdiction. Song was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment but was ineffective. He died at 2:30 p.m. Detective Zhang Yi went to investigate and took the body to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road to await examination. Yesterday morning, the police sent Wang to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the case and filed a prosecution for murder, stating that the autopsy was still pending, so all evidence could not be submitted and requested an extension. Judge Qian Hongye briefly questioned the defendants and approved the postponement for further review. At around 10 a.m., Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor from the Prosecutor's Office of the Special District One Court, together with two forensic doctors, Wei and Zhang, and a clerk, arrived at the Forensic Examination Office. At the same time, the police also transferred the defendants to the office. After Zhang examined the body, Wang Rongzhang was interrogated and confessed that he was 35 years old, a local, and lived at No. 15 Tongchunfang, Dongxinqiao. He worked as a shadow puppeteer. The deceased owed him three yuan and fifty cents in national currency and refused to pay it back. The night before, he beat me. Yesterday, I was drunk and borrowed a fruit knife. I first fought with the deceased, and because I was no match for him, I stabbed him with the knife. The rest of the confession was evasive. According to Song Zhang's投称, the death of the deceased Song Amao, male, was indeed caused by being stabbed to death by a knife while alive. The body was handed over to his wife, Song Zhang, for burial. The criminal, Wang Rongzhang, has been prosecuted by the police and is awaiting a court verdict.

### Zhang Wenbin Accused of Extortion and Fraud, Trial Concluded

Zhang Wenbin, an investigator hired by the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, in September of the 23rd year of the Republic, when he was under Captain Yu's command, falsely accused Yang Baoshan, who lived at No. 4 Xingye Lane, Bailinan Road, of smoking opium and took him to the Investigation Team. He then used non-criminal intimidation by pouring tap water into his mouth and nose and extorted 20 yuan from Yang Shi山 before releasing him. Yang endured it without saying anything. On April 12, 25th year of the Republic, he and the escaped detectives Xiao Huaibaozi and Du Sanhua went to Yang Baoshan's home to search for smoking paraphernalia, thinking that they could extort him again. Yang Baoshan, feeling that things were different now than they were before, reported it to the police, who arrested Zhang Wenbin and sent him to the Songhu Garrison Command for investigation. The case was determined to be an ordinary criminal case and did not involve military matters, so it was transferred to the local court, where prosecutor Tang Ruxiu opened a trial for investigation, summoning witness Sun Shouqing to testify that the 20 yuan was transferred to Zhang's hand, thus clarifying the case. He then filed a public prosecution for the crime under Article 346, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Yu opened a trial, and the defendant's lawyer, Gu Jichang, appeared in court to defend him. The defendant claimed in his own defense that he had arrested people for opium before, so he was falsely accused out of resentment, and that the search of his home was only based on his statement and had no evidence. The court debate concluded and the verdict will be announced on the 16th.

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a letter to the National New Pharmaceutical Industry Association to explain that membership certificates do not need to be affixed with stamps, saying, "On the 9th of this month, we received your来函, inquiring whether membership certificates should be affixed with stamp duties.

The certificates issued by people's organizations mentioned in the presentation, such as chamber of commerce membership certificates and industry association membership certificates, are not the凭证 related to the permission of business operations by the competent authorities and are therefore different in nature from the provisions of the month and should not be affixed with stamps.'

### Minghua Exclusively Sells Machine Oil

Wang Xiaolai and others are sparing no effort in promoting saving the country through motors and economic construction. They deeply feel that there is a lack of high-quality motor oil and machine oil. They originally intended to raise funds to open mines and operate their own oil factories, but due to the time required for preparation, and the rapid progress of various domestic construction projects, they had to select the best products from Europe and the United States for immediate use. They instructed the Shanghai German firm Reiho & Co. to open a new machine oil department to manage machine oil and motor oil produced by the renowned British firm Sternol. After testing by famous technicians, the quality was confirmed to be superior to that of other firms.

### Zheng He's Family Tree Appears

Zheng He, the Three Treasure Eunuch of the Zhu Ming Dynasty, led the fleet seven times to the Western Seas during the Yongle and Xuande reigns, laying the foundation for the migration of millions of overseas Chinese to Southeast Asia today. Zheng He managed more than 30 countries and his footprints extended to the east coast of Africa. He is not only a great man of China but also one of the world's greatest navigators. In recent years, Chinese and Western scholars have written extensively on him. However, because the Ming History and the notes written by people at that time only focus on the voyages to the Western Seas and there is no information about Zheng He's family, hometown, nature, and descendants, modern research is rich in quantity but cannot escape its scope. Zheng He was a Hui Muslim from Kunyang County, Yunnan. His descendants are in Shigoutou Village, Yuxi County, adjacent to Kunyang. Recently, General Li Yiting of Yuxi discovered his family's secretly hidden family tree. Mr. Li Shihou of Ludian explained it in detail and wrote a book, "A Study of Zheng He's Family Tree." The original family tree provides detailed records of Zheng He's hometown, background, nature, and descendants, and the study provides thorough explanations without omission. It also provides many corrections to the errors in historical records regarding the voyages to the Western Seas. It is expected to arouse great interest in academic circles. This book is currently sold by the Zhengzhong Bookstore on Xihua Street, Yunnan. Each copy costs one dime in national currency. For mail orders from other places, no extra postage is charged, and postage stamps are fully accepted.

### Hunan Woman Luo Xi Sues He Kangli for Obscenity and is Sentenced

Six months imprisonment suspended for two years

Luo Xi, a 17-year-old woman from Hunan, was orphaned at a young age and fostered in the Wei family, so she is also known as Wei Xuezhen. Because her foster father engaged in misconduct towards her, she resolutely came to Shanghai with her classmate Xu Zuomin to study in August last year. She currently resides at No. 318 Qinle Village, Avenue Joffre, French Concession. On the morning of October 19 last year, she went to her fellow villager He Kangli's place at No. 16 Xuehuafang, Avenue Edward VII, to borrow a bed board and was forcibly raped by He. This happened several times thereafter. He promised to marry Luo, but after several liaisons, Luo became pregnant. When she urged He to hold the engagement ceremony, He proposed absurd conditions: first, Luo would commit suicide with him in Pudong; second, Luo would commit adultery with Liu Binru, a fellow villager living with her, in order to place the responsibility for the child on Liu in the future. Luo had no choice but to accept the first condition and had intercourse with Liu. Later, Liu discovered He's secret and invited his fellow villagers to a banquet to announce He's scheme. He was enraged and abandoned Luo. Luo had no choice but to report to the French police. He had already heard the news and fled to Nanjing. He secretly returned to Shanghai in the middle of last month and was discovered by Luo, who reported to the French police again. The detectives arrested He and sent him to the Special Second Court, where the lawyer of the Police Department filed a public prosecution for rape of a woman under the age of sixteen and obstruction of morality. The plaintiff, Luo Xi, also hired a lawyer to file an incidental civil suit, requesting compensation for living expenses (at 40 yuan per month until the age of 50) and losses such as dowry money, totaling 20,200 yuan. Judge Liao Yan opened court several times to summon witnesses and conduct investigations. The defendant also hired a lawyer to defend him. The case was declared closed, and a date was set for sentencing, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the date for sentencing arrived. At 3:00 PM, Judge Liao ordered the defendant to be brought to the First Criminal Court. The plaintiff also appeared in court to await sentencing. After a brief inquiry into the defendant's age and place of origin, Judge Liao sentenced He Kangli to six months imprisonment, suspended for two years, for raping a woman under the age of sixteen. The incidental civil suit was transferred to the Civil Court.

### International Basketball Second Finals: China Defeats the United States

45:32 Zhou Dayun's Luck Comes and He Scores 20 Points Alone; The Whole Team is Active and the Defense is Tight, and the Enemy's Momentum is Restrained

Russia Defeats Japan Again to Win the Group B Championship

Last night, the Chinese basketball team, with its extremely agile and lively posture, defeated the American team with a score of 45 to 32. Thus, the senior group championship of this year's international basketball tournament will have to be resolved in the third final on Saturday night. Although China lost the first game 34 to 44, it adopted an aggressive policy from the beginning last night, with great momentum. Except for a brief period in the first half when it was 14 to 16 behind, it led the way and put the United States in a difficult battle. Although Zhou Dayun's style of play hinders the cooperation of the whole team, his luck came last night, and every shot was a hit, scoring 20 points alone, which was the greatest contribution to China's victory, compensating for his mistakes in the first game. From this point of view, the success or failure of the Chinese team will depend on Zhou himself. Another reason for the victory is that all five players were able to fulfill their duties and closely monitor their opponents. Tall players such as Rock Klein were useless, and Carson had few opportunities to penetrate the basket. Comparatively speaking, Feng Nianhua was the most outstanding. In the Group B match, Russia defeated Japan again, 28 to 17, and the championship went to Russia. The scores of the China-US battle are as follows:

First Strike After the Japan-Russia game, China and the United States took the stage. China started with Feng, Yin, Kuang, Cai, and Wang. American Kinding was absent, and Borie, Rock, Klein, Paros, and Carson played. After the game started, China took the first strike and pounced on the enemy's stronghold with great vigor. Feng Nianhua registered first, and Cai Yanxiong added one point for Borie's foul. Then Cai snatched the ball under the basket and rushed out, achieving success again, with a score of 5 to 0 at the height of the moment. Feng Nianhua and others were active in drilling, and Wang and Cai's defense was tight, and the enemy's momentum was restrained. After five minutes, Kuang Yao Ya's foul allowed Borie to open the record for the United States.

Tense Period After Kuang Yaozhi registered two points, Locke suddenly performed his old tricks and scored two in the basket, making it 7 to 5. Cai Yanxiong was a sharpshooter, and Rock and Carson fought hard, tying the score at 9 to 9. China suspended the game, and Chen Zongqi replaced Cai Yanxiong to deal with Locke, which proved effective. Feng Nianhua and Wang Nanzhen added three points, and China was originally in the lead. Although Klein returned a goal, Kuang Yaozhi added another ball. After Rhein made a free throw, China replaced Kuang Yaozhi with Zhou Dayun. Locke threw a ball behind his back with one hand, suddenly surpassing China with 15 to 14. Carson added another point with a free throw, and the situation became more serious. Fortunately, everyone stepped up their defense and blocked the enemy's momentum. Feng Nianhua first tied the score at 16 to 16, and Zhou Dacheng followed with 18 to 16, winning two points for China. The first half ended.

Golden Age As the battle resumed, China replaced Yin Guiren with Han Zhenyuan, while the others were Feng, Zhou, Chen, and Wang. The United States remained the same. Rhein rushed straight into the basket and threw a ball from the outside of the boundary, which the referee did not see, resulting in a score of 18 to 18. Wang Nanzhen broke through the encirclement and dribbled the ball like a god, immediately scoring. Zhou Chen and Feng made three visits to the thatched cottage, leading by 25 to 18, with great momentum. The United States called a timeout, and Paros was replaced by Fost. At this time, China was in its prime, and the long legs of the United States lost their effectiveness. Although Carson was brave, he had no time for defense, let alone offense. Zhou Dayun's luck suddenly came, and he shot as soon as he got the ball, and every shot was a hit, scoring five goals in a short time, overwhelming the United States with 35 to 18. The momentum was so strong that it was invincible. From then on, China was worry-free.

Smooth Sailing A smooth road leads to all things. At this time, China was invincible. The center jump was also repeatedly seized by Feng Chen and others, further reducing the opponent's shooting opportunities. When there were opportunities, they often lost their targets due to overeagerness. Zhou Dayun's luck did not wane, and he continued to score five points, leading by 40 to 23, with a difference of 17 points, the largest difference. Later, Kuang Yaozhi replaced Zhou to rest, and at 43 to 27 when Feng Nianhua committed his fourth foul, he re-entered the field. At this time, China's victory was in hand, and the United States team was exhausted and had to admit defeat. The final result was 45 to 32.

Russia Wins Japan Starting at 7:00, Japan and Russia opened fire first. The Russian team, with its physical advantages, was quite smooth, and with high luck and accurate shooting, they took the lead in the first half with 17 to 4. After the break, Japan tried to retaliate, and although it led by one point with 12 to 11, the overall result was still 17 to 28, with Russia winning. The results are as follows:

Hand-Thrown Distance and Tug-of-War Competitions

The Social Bureau Provides Separate Explanations

The ninth Municipal Social Bureau-sponsored Elementary School Joint Games, scheduled for next month, have been previously reported.

The girls' group A will add a 200-meter relay event. Male athletes weighing over 115 pounds and female athletes weighing 110 pounds or more will be classified as a special group and will use the same events as the male and female group A. The points they obtain will not be included in the military ranking calculation.

Explanation of Hand-Thrown Distance 1. The hand projectile weighs one and a half pounds. 2. The rules of the softball throwing distance competition are used. 3. The Lao Ximen Standard Company and the Ziqiang Sporting Goods Company both sell them.

Explanation of Tug-of-War Competition (1) Use a thick hemp rope with a diameter of two inches and a length of approximately 120 feet. A red ribbon is tied in the center, and a red ribbon is also tied on each side, ten feet away from the center, as a sign. (2) During the preliminary selection in each district, the school is the unit, and each school participates in one team, limited to 30 people. During the general assembly, the district is the unit, and each district participates in one team, limited to 50 people. (3) The competition adopts an elimination system, using a five-game three-win system to determine the winner. (4) During the competition, each team holds one end of the rope, with the red ribbon in the center aligned with the white line on the ground. Touching the rope with one hand within fifteen feet of the center to either side is forbidden. After the referee gives the order, the two teams pull backwards with all their strength, and the team that pulls the red ribbon of the opposing team over the white line wins. (5) After each win or loss, there is a one-minute break, and then the competition resumes. If no winner is determined within three minutes, the referee will order the game to stop, rest for one minute, and then restart the game until a winner is determined.

### Xiqing Volleyball Qixiu Defeats the Bureau of Works Girls' Middle School

Since the start of the Xiqing Women's Volleyball League, Qixiu and the Bureau of Works Girls' Middle School have won all their battles and are tied for first place. The two teams met for the first time last night, which was no different from the championship finals. After the contact, the Bureau of Works Girls' Middle School showed its power and won several cities first. Qixiu tried hard to counterattack, but had to follow behind. Before long, the Bureau of Works Girls' Middle School easily won the first game 15 to 10. How could Qixiu be weak? Relying on skilled cooperation and sharp spikes, the score rose sharply, and the Bureau of Works Girls' Middle School was helpless. The whole game scored only five points, and Qixiu tied the score 15 to 5. The last game was the key to victory or defeat, and both sides gave their all. Qixiu was ultimately a better player and won the third game 15 to 8 again. Thus, the championship seat has fallen into Qixiu's hands. In another game, Suker defeated the Red Team in three straight games, which has no bearing on the championship. The list of the two Chinese teams and the results of yesterday's competition are recorded below:

### Dr. Zhou Houfu's New Discovery: Electronic Theory

Enables an extremely simple and unified satisfactory explanation
of the complex and fragmented field of organic chemistry

British expert Ingolde, a leading authority in chemistry,
sends a letter congratulating on its success

Organic chemistry has long been viewed as a complex science. Over the decades, scholars from various countries have proposed numerous theories and rules, but they can only explain a tiny portion of the facts. In addition, many reactions have been seen as irregular and unexplainable. Zhou Houfu, head of the Chemistry Department at Zhejiang University, has devoted himself to the study of organic theory in recent years. He invented a new electronic theory last year, which was published in the Journal of the Chinese Chemical Society and the German Central Chemical Journal. The paper points out the errors of various theories over the decades and encompasses all the facts of organic chemistry. Countless previously incomprehensible reactions are now given an extremely simple and unified satisfactory explanation, transforming a complex and fragmented organic chemistry into an easily understood and memorized subject, similar to the effect of the ionization theory in inorganic chemistry. The main point of Zhou's theory is that it does not recognize that each element occupies a fixed position in the periodic table, but that in fact, the properties of each element can change with the movement of electron positions. For example, carbon can sometimes be equal to boron, sometimes equal to nitrogen or oxygen; nitrogen can sometimes be equal to oxygen, sometimes equal to boron or carbon, and so on. Therefore, the periodic table is actually a continuous function, not occupied by individual elements. It is also acceptable to say that the periodic table is connected by countless elements of different properties. This kind of shift in thickness always depends on the atoms it is connected to and always follows a simple and unchanging rule. Last year, Zhou's paper published in the Journal of the Chinese Chemical Society was sent to contemporary authorities in organic and physical chemistry in Europe and the United States, such as Han Zifei Xu of Germany, who was not a Geller Fayan Division, Bress Noma of France, and Rox and others of the United States, all of whom sent replies praising it. For example, Ingolde of the United Kingdom, the founder of the electronic transfer theory and the highest authority in physical theoretical chemistry in modern times, wrote in his letter: "When I finished reading your paper with great interest, I couldn't help but feel shocked in my emotions, that is, the breadth of your theory's application and the thoroughness of your understanding. I hope that the dissemination of your theory will deepen the world's interest in organic chemical reactions and structural problems from now on. I can assert that most of what you have discussed will be immediately recognized by most countries in Europe and America." Recently, Zhou has further promoted and reorganized his theory and written it into a book of more than 70,000 words, entitled "A New Electronic Theory of Organic Reactions." It draws on extensive evidence, lists hundreds of difficult and unresolved problems in organic chemistry over the past few decades, and gives extremely simple and clear explanations one by one. It also uses the results of physical methods such as X-ray, red internal light, cathode ray analysis, decomposition potential difference of organic groups, and dipole moment to prove the accuracy of his theory. At the end of the book, it also gives a concise description of the theories of organic reactions of various schools in the past for comparison. The book has been published. It is reported that the Shanghai Joint Bookstore is distributing and selling it on consignment. It is expected that after the popularity of Zhou's theory, a major revolution will occur in the entire chemistry field, and it will also occupy an important page in the history of chemistry.

### Private School Association Opposes the Concessions Bureau's Harsh Demands

The Fire Department claims that the equipment is inadequate for some reason

It is decided to negotiate with the government based on reason

The Private School Association of the First Special District of this port has been working quite intensively recently on the issues of the Concessions Bureau's subsidies and infringement of educational sovereignty. At a meeting held a few days ago, the attending committee members Feng Yixian, Sun Yucai, Jin Yuezhang, Cui Jianwu, Zhang Lingfei, Qi Juechen, Song An, Feng Shuhua, Weng Guoxun, Ge Youren, Li Guixiong, Lin Zhenxin and others unanimously resolved to issue a declaration, the full text of which has been revised and passed by the meeting, and is now specially transcribed as follows:

Different Treatment for Chinese and Foreign Schools: Chinese and foreign people residing in the First Special District pay the same 14% of the Concessions Bureau's taxes, but the education subsidies they receive, according to the statistics of 1936, are 35.8 yuan per student for the Japanese, 27.1 yuan per student for Westerners, and only 4.9 yuan per student for us Chinese. In the same area, they fulfill the same obligations, but the rights to education subsidies they enjoy are vastly different. This unequal treatment can be said to be extreme. Unexpectedly, the Concessions Bureau still thinks it is not enough and makes extra harsh demands on this small amount of subsidy funds, creating difficulties in every way. First, it was the toilets and teacups, then the building facilities. Westerners who do not understand education or the environment are assigned to harass the schools from time to time. If the orders are delayed slightly, the subsidies are deducted. Once they are followed, they are changed every morning and evening, and new tricks must be invented every semester. Recently, they have become even more aggressive. Because we Chinese are courteous and easy to deal with, they have gone so far as to limit the number of students in classrooms, investigate all accounts, remodel stairs, and remove window frames. May I ask what regulations the Concessions Bureau is based on? Outside the scope of the subsidy funds, they can review all our accounts. As for limiting classrooms and remodeling stairs, the costs are not cheap. Removing window frames will make it impossible to sleep peacefully at night due to the need to guard against petty thieves. And what benefits does it have for education? If it is said to be an excuse for fire prevention, then schools have disaster avoidance training during the day and teacher supervision, which can gather at a safe location in a few minutes, which cannot be compared to a disorganized crowd. Looking at Shanghai, how many hundreds of fires have there been, and have any students sacrificed themselves?

Infringement of Sovereignty and Contempt for Administration: Not understanding education, not being familiar with the environment, unreasonable interference, infringement of our sovereignty, and contempt for our administration are becoming increasingly serious. It is bound to make the school authorities overwhelmed and unable to comply. To protect sovereignty, they are unwilling to comply and automatically give up the right to subsidies. The Social Bureau has its own authority to supervise Chinese schools, so why bother the Concessions Bureau to act on its behalf? Moreover, the equipment situation of each school that has received subsidies was considered satisfactory by the Concessions Bureau before the subsidies began. Now, the equipment situation is still the same, the number of students is still the same, and the subsidies of as many as seven or eight out of ten schools are deducted or have problems due to nitpicking. Oppression has reached its extreme, and courtesy cannot be said again. A country with independence and a people with freedom cannot belittle themselves and be controlled and dominated by others. Strive for survival, compatriots, why not rise up and fight for it, vowing to fight for equal treatment, demanding an increase in Chinese education funds, and opposing this unreasonable nitpicking and immediately canceling the deadline for renovation notices. If these goals cannot be achieved, then the subsidies are the rights that we Chinese should enjoy after paying taxes. For the sake of national sovereignty, for the sake of education for compatriots in the Concessions, and for the sake of the rights of taxpayers, unite all compatriots in the area and take effective measures to deal with it. And we colleagues in private schools should especially organize our steps and consolidate our ranks to await further orders.

### The Social Bureau Orders Supplementary Schools to Submit Registration Applications

The Municipal Social Bureau believes that a small number of private supplementary schools in the city have been approved for establishment for a long time, but have not yet submitted registration applications after the deadline, which is a violation of the regulations. It is reported that the bureau specially instructed each supplementary school yesterday to complete the registration procedures within one month, otherwise the establishment will be revoked, the school will be ordered to close, or disciplinary action will be taken.

### Yarn and Cotton

Three-Ply Yarn Plummets

The Yarn Market Feels More and More Unsupported

Recent Hedge Selling Continues

The Market is Exceptionally Slack

The yarn market trend has started to decline slightly. Osaka's three-ply yarn, which had been soaring for days, suddenly fell back yesterday, breaking the 260 yuan mark. As a result, people's hearts were affected. At the same time, the bulls of the past are still selling in the near month, and the pressure is very heavy. As for the spot yarn sales market, it is also normal. However, the North Road office has a good appetite, that is, the situation of US cotton is still stable, and the attitude towards forward purchases is optimistic, and the market is becoming more and more expensive.

Auction Yarn Falls by 1.34 Yuan

Because US cotton rebounded again, the market atmosphere this month was tighter at the opening of the auction yarn market, rising by 0.6 yuan. However, when auctioned to the forward month, it turned downward because the price was high and Jinchang continued to sell in the near month, people's hearts were slack, and the market turned slack. At the same time, the telegram of three-ply yarn was recently close to a decline and far to a rise, and the market situation was more frustrated. At the second auction, the near month suddenly fell by 1.4 yuan, the far month was still able to support it, and the third closing was still mediocre. The auction yarn result was that each month fell by 0.8 yuan to 0.9 yuan to 1 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day. In the afternoon opening, the price of three-ply yarn fell, the popularity was even weaker, buyers were lacking, and the market price slowly went downstream. The second and third rounds saw a slight rebound, but until the close, the price of three-ply yarn fell again, losing 5.8 yuan for the near month and 3.4 yuan for the far month compared to the previous day's price. The selling momentum suddenly strengthened. The auction yarn results were that each month fell by 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Dafeng sold 1,050 bales, Gengfeng 2,750 bales, Dachangcheng 3,400 bales, Runkang 2,550 bales, Fukang 1,400 bales, Hengyi 1,600 bales, Yukang 900 bales, Yicheng 600 bales, Dachang 550 bales, and Shenji 500 bales. Jinchang bought 700 bales, Yuda 2,150 bales, Changji 1,200 bales, Taichang 2,800 bales, Xincheng 1,800 bales, Senkang 2,000 bales, Renfeng 1,000 bales, Hengchang 900 bales, and Zhenda 600 bales.

The Jin Gang is the Healthiest for Yarn Sales

The spot yarn sales are still good, but less than the previous day. The Jin Gang's appetite is the healthiest, and 600 bales of goods were opened yesterday. Including other gangs bought a total of 1,385 bales, the selling price is average, and the purchase amount is listed below.

It is Expected that US Cotton Will Rebound

Auction Cotton Fell First Yesterday

The cotton market is falling, and the momentum is very weak. Because Shanghai has a surplus of cotton and the factory's storage is enough for two or three months of use, although foreign cotton is rising steadily, the air force is still strong. In the afternoon, the price of cotton fell due to the decline in the yarn market and the price of three-ply cotton. It is expected that today's US cotton may have a reactive rebound trend.

The Decline of the Far Month of 0.4 Yuan is the Largest

Because US cotton reported a rebound of 16 to 24 pounds, but Indian cotton fell 2.5 to 3 rupees, the cotton market at the opening of the previous market was peaceful and the buying atmosphere was indifferent. Because Shanghai has a sufficient supply of cotton, the yarn market has softened, and the cotton market is even more tired. As a result, each month of auction cotton fell by 0.05 yuan to 0.4 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day. In the afternoon opening, the market fell even more because the three-ply cotton market rebounded slightly, and most psychology expected that today's US cotton would have a reactive rebound phenomenon, and the market was even softer. As a result, each month fell by another 0.05 yuan to 0.1 yuan to 0.4 yuan compared with the morning closing price. It was found that Daji sold 1,300 dan, Dafeng 1,100 dan, Chengji 1,500 dan, Hexing 2,200 dan, Yichang 5,700 dan, Runkang 3,800 dan, Yikang 3,200 dan, Xinchang 1,100 dan, Dachang 2,400 dan, and Fukang 1,300 dan. Jinchang bought 1,100 dan, Changji 2,500 dan, Dafeng 1,400 dan, Taichang 5,000 dan, Yuan 1,1800 dan, Yongda 3,500 dan, Changhe 5,300 dan, Ruiyuan 1,200 dan, Juxing 1,100 dan, Daji 1,000 dan, Dachang 1,100 dan, and Tonghe 1,100 dan. The highest and lowest prices in a day are listed on the left.

The Consumption of Spot Cotton is More Prosperous by Japanese Factories

The spot cotton procurement by Chinese merchants is not smooth, while Japanese merchants factories are constantly purchasing Lingbao fine velvet, and there is no source.

Both Hedging and Closing are Available

US Cotton Still Rises by More Than 20 Pounds

At the opening of the US cotton market yesterday, the market was mixed, with each month falling by 2 pounds to rising by 6 pounds. Then speculators bought in, and the market price gradually rose. The spot cotton legs were strong, and spot merchants and colleagues continued to buy. At the same time, the cloth sales were prosperous, and the empty accounts were being covered one after another, and the market situation became more and more firm. Later, the bulls took profits and closed out, and a slight rebound was seen. At the close, it was still firm. It is estimated that the spot price rose by 22 pounds, and the futures rose by 19 to 25 pounds. The British cotton spot price fell by 7 points, and the futures fell by 1 to 3 points. Indian cotton initially fell due to bulls closing out, but then rebounded due to exporters buying in. After that, the amount of bulls closing out and futures merchants selling out was absorbed by those who bought in on dips. It is estimated that Pingle Falls 2.5 to 2.75 rupees, Oumula Falls 2.5 rupees, and Bairoxi Falls 2.5 to 3 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 9th).

According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast on the 10th was 239 rupees for Bairoxi and 222.75 rupees for Oumula, both up 4.5 rupees, and 190.5 rupees for Pingle, up 4.25 rupees.

Three-Ply Futures Yarn Reacts and Falls Back

The Fluctuation of Futures Cotton is Still Small

Osaka telegram on the 10th: The spot price rose by 3 to 5 yuan, 250 yuan for 16-count fans, up 4 yuan, 268 yuan for 20-count goldfish, up 3 yuan, 405 yuan for 40-count five-star, and 399 yuan for 42-count pheasant, both up 5 yuan. The price of three-ply futures yarn fell by 3.4 yuan to 5.8 yuan, 254.1 yuan for the near month, and 258.5 yuan for the far month. The price of futures cotton fell by 0.25 yuan to a rise of 0.3 yuan, 78.95 yuan for the near month, and 82.3 yuan for the far month.

### Securities

Call Loan Interest Rates Rising, Major Public Bond Investors Emerging

Market Prices Down 4-6 Jiao

After a long period of consolidation, the public bond market showed signs of gradually clearing yesterday. Major bullish investors emerged, while bearish investors continued to release large quantities of physical bonds. At the same time, call loan interest rates tightened, opening at 1.2% yesterday. With arbitrage opportunities diminishing, selling pressure on public bonds intensified. The total amount of margin accounts for this month is still around 20 million. The bearish camp is controlled by major investors with strong financial resources. Therefore, the future trend is likely to continue to be weak and decline. At the opening of trading yesterday morning, the trend was still sluggish. Retail investors were buying, while bonds numbered 35 and 43 were being heavily sold. Category E bonds for this month were up 5 fen, while Category C and A bonds were down 5 fen to 2 jiao. In the second session, bonds numbered 5 and 35 continued to be sold off significantly, while bond 10 saw considerable buying. Market prices continued to fall by 5 fen to 2 jiao. At the opening of trading in the afternoon, activity increased, but the market remained weak. Bonds numbered 43 and 32 were being heavily dumped, while bond 5 also saw significant selling. Category E bonds rose again by a small amount, from 5 fen to 3 jiao 5 fen. The closing trend remained sluggish, with considerable selling of bond 43 at each level. Bonds numbered 5 and 35 continued to be dumped. Market prices fell again by a small amount, from 5 fen to 3 jiao 5 fen. Overall, the results for the day showed a uniform decline of 2 jiao 5 fen to 6 jiao. The total transaction volume was 4,715,000 yuan. The comparison of price increases and decreases, highs and lows, is listed in the table below: (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: Hundred Yuan)

Flour Actual Sales Stalled

Yesterday, the flour market showed a pattern of rising first and then falling in all contract months after opening in the morning. Foreign wheat quotations were positive, with Chicago up 2-3 jiao, Canada up 3-4 jiao, and Liverpool up 1 penny. Therefore, the opening prices were quite encouraging, rising by about 1 fen compared to the previous day's closing prices. However, after this, prices gradually fell back. Recent actual sales stalled, and non-industry bullish investors had to release positions along with the market. April contracts also saw bullish investors becoming weak. July and August contracts are new flour, and with increased releases to market, prices also leveled off. As of the opening of trading in the afternoon, recent contracts such as March and April saw little activity in actual sales. Bullish investors slightly liquidated positions, falling another 1 fen compared to the morning. July and August contracts also fell 1 fen due to new short selling. Currently, if sales remain sluggish, the market in the near term is expected to continue to be weak.

Japanese Flour Shipping to Shanghai

Although the Volume is Small... Future Concerns

In the past six months, Japanese goods have been imported in large quantities, with weekly volumes consistently reaching 10,000 tons. According to the shipping industry, this has almost restored the situation before the January 28th Incident. As a result, Japanese merchants are all delighted. As for the imported Japanese goods, sugar, rayon, steel, lead wire, and chemicals, such as hydrochloric acid, have been the most common, as reported previously. However, yesterday's imported Japanese vessel Mikasa Maru carried 3,140 tons of cargo, including 1,000 bags of flour in addition to sugar and steel plates. Since flour and wheat prices have been rising, this is enough to entice the import of foreign flour. In the Tianjin area, Japanese flour has a special position and has the potential to replace domestic flour. Shanghai, on the other hand, has numerous flour mills and has traditionally supplied various regions. Now, Japanese flour is being imported. It is unknown what the machine-made flour industry thinks and how it will respond.

Price Declines Even Greater

Yesterday, the wheat market was sluggish and weak in all contract months. Although foreign wheat quotations were up 2-3-4 jiao and 1 penny, recent flour sales have been weak. Although some rivers in the north have opened, trading has been quiet. The main reason is that the market price of domestic flour is too high. Japanese flour is taking the opportunity to promote sales. With the wheat market not driven by flour sales, it has to trend towards softening. Therefore, this month's contracts fell by 7 fen, and distant contracts also lacked luster. By the opening of trading in the afternoon, this month's contracts became soft again due to the difficult flour market. The lowest price was 6 jiao 2 fen, a huge drop of 1 jiao 3 fen compared to the previous day. April contracts also fell by 5 fen. New wheat contracts from June onward saw little trading and remained quiet. The sharp fall in this month's contracts was partly due to bullish investors becoming nervous and exiting positions, and partly due to rumors of new short selling entering the market, resulting in a complete collapse. Currently, the wheat market is weak due to the lack of improvement in flour sales and a decline in the standard. Therefore, prices are being lowered by another 2-3 fen. Shandong wheat is quoted at 6 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen, Tiantai wheat at 6 yuan 6 jiao 1-2 fen, and Huaian wheat at 6 yuan 6 jiao 3 fen, with an estimated 1,000 bags traded.

Soybean Oil Cake Suddenly Returned Downward in the Afternoon

Yesterday, the standard soybean oil cake market opened in the morning, continuing the previous day's bullish momentum. Continuous telegrams reported price increases, and soybean oil cake prices in all markets were firm. However, the actual soybean processing by factories decreased yesterday, with only merchant groups handling small amounts. The consumption of oil cake was also average, and there were rumors of a decline in telegrams from Dalian. Short sellers immediately hedged, and bullish investors also sought to liquidate positions. In the afternoon, prices in all sessions followed the market and trended downward. The closing price for standard oil fell by 2 jiao to 3 jiao 5 fen, standard soybeans fell by 4-5 fen, and standard cake fell by 2.5 fen to 1.5 fen.

River Rice Sales Not Improving

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various groups was relatively scarce, totaling only about 20 groups, with approximately 4,700-4,800 piculs of goods. The local sales market was sluggish, and buyers were weak. Tianjin groups handled 7-8 packages of Bo Dao rice, and Xi'an groups handled 700-800 packages of thick Japonica rice. Therefore, the market situation remained weak. As a result, thick Japonica rice prices fell again by 5 fen to 1 jiao, while Bo Dao rice continued to depreciate. The situation seems difficult to improve. Du Yang pointed rice was slightly soft, and Yin Yuan rice had no market.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were few boats arriving from various places along the river, only about 7-8. Due to the weather being intermittently cloudy and rainy, few shops listed goods on the market. Trading of various goods on the market became increasingly quiet. White Japonica rice prices were weak, and high-priced Bo Dao rice was not fixed. Medium and lower grade Bo Dao rice and early rice were weak. Bai Yuan rice and various indica rices remained sluggish. Other rices were slightly soft.

(Passenger Indica) Arrivals were still strong yesterday, and inventory was also high. The appetite of local and visiting merchants was weak in the morning. Local, Quanzhou, and Cantonese groups handled hundreds of packages. Only 3,000-4,000 packages were traded in half a day, and prices immediately fell by a small amount of 5-6 fen. In the afternoon, Cantonese consumption revived, and 5,000 packages of brown rice and over 1,000 packages of white rice were actively handled in the market. Local merchants also continued to handle, and market prices quickly turned upward, rebounding by 5-6-7 fen. Goods owners also eased their efforts to depreciate prices to sell, and the situation returned to stability. A total of over 8,000 packages of Jiangxi rice, over 2,000 packages of Hunan rice, and 1,000 packages of Han brown rice were released throughout the day.

### Piece Goods

Light-Colored Goods Selling Slightly Slower

– Not Without Influence From the Weather

Yesterday, the cloth market showed a pattern of firmness followed by weakness, inevitably following the ups and downs of the yarn market. However, actual sales are expected to continue to develop, and trading in various goods is gradually becoming active. Eastern goods of fine twill are in better condition due to their superior quality. During the off-season for light-colored twill in the spring, factory output has decreased significantly. Recently, the sales of bleached fine twill have gradually increased, and the demand for gray cloth is also urgent, with supply somewhat falling short of demand. The market price is gradually rising. Yesterday, Dongxing opened futures contracts for May, June, and July for 500-600 bales, with prices for brands such as Wufu Dragon Head and Yanghe rising by 5 fen. Spot trading was also active, with daily deliveries required and prices also increasing by 5 fen. The fine cloth market was flat, with slightly weak trading, influenced by the rainy weather.

The Tianjin group imported over 30 boxes of Sijunzi serge, priced at 2 jiao 6 fen 2.5 li per yard, with no fluctuations. The sales of light-colored goods for spring are also slightly slow due to the influence of the weather, but there is hope for a rebound once the weather clears.

### Silk and Tea

Spring Sales to Begin, Silk Mills More Actively Purchasing Silk Weft

Yesterday, the overseas silk market continued to be firm. New York near-term standard silk rose by 4 fen, and futures rose by 3.5 fen. The exchange's trading volume reached 4,050 bales. Yokohama silk prices rose slightly by 3 yuan to 5 yuan for current and futures contracts. The Lyon silk market also trended towards firmness. However, the foreign exchange rate of the franc remained unbalanced, causing French firms to remain on the sidelines. American firms are selling new silk, which has been opening up gradually in recent days. White factory prices for Jingfengque and Blue Eagle are 750 yuan, with little fluctuation. Local silk mills, anticipating the start of spring sales, are also purchasing raw materials more actively. A total of 130 bales were traded yesterday.

### Sugar Market

Big Gong White Returned Down 1-2 Jiao

Currently, green cakes and Taier cakes are both opening at 7 yuan 2 jiao, and consumption remains strong. However, Geng cakes are selling extremely poorly, currently selling at 8 yuan 5 jiao.

The price of fungus in Shanghai has decreased due to poor consumption by various groups, and prices for Sichuan fungus, etc., have decreased. The production price in Hankou once reached 114 yuan.

Lead Selling Firmly, Little Actual Sales

Fixed prices for lead have been increasing continuously in recent days. Therefore, local market prices have also been rising accordingly. Yesterday, the selling price was 43 yuan per picul, an increase of approximately 1 yuan. However, actual sales were limited, and the market appeared quite sluggish. It was found that only over 200 strips were handled by visiting groups yesterday, and the buying and selling of factories seemed very quiet.

Imports Exceed Exports, Dutch and Italian Imports Over 6,000 Tons

January's Foreign Trade Surplus

Recent Imports Show Increased Activity

According to previous reports from the customs, the foreign trade surplus for January was 5 million. Goods shipped to Europe and America were mainly silk and tea, followed by tung oil, egg yolk, egg white, and other products. Since the second half of last year, soybeans, sesame seeds, and other miscellaneous grains have been shipped to Europe, and a small amount of flour has been shipped to Java, Singapore, and other places. It is now known that the Italian vessel Conto Fante, which will export the day after tomorrow (12th), is carrying 1,000 tons of sesame seeds to Italy. The vessel imported 1,000 tons yesterday, including 650 boxes of rayon, over 200 boxes of piece goods, and other items such as foreign paper, steel, and machinery. The Dutch vessel that arrived the day before yesterday carried a large quantity of white wax, 23,360 packages, sugar, over 28,500 bags, and approximately 5,000 tons of rubber, starch, and tea. The import of Japanese goods has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper and does not need to be repeated. Therefore, although there was a foreign trade surplus in January, indicating a lot of exports, recent imports have also been very crowded. It is unknown if there will be another month with similar records in the future.

### Preparation Method for Income Tax Return Forms (7)

— Pan Shihao

(3) Report Form for Deposits Received by Commercial Firms

The third category of the current income tax is income from securities and deposits. According to Article 27 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, the income tax on deposit interest should be withheld by the person in charge of the business of the interest-paying institution. The so-called interest-paying institution, in addition to financial institutions such as banks and money shops, is also a commercial firm that receives deposits. This form is used by such commercial firms to report the receipt of deposits, so that the responsible collection authority can audit them. As for the future withholding of income tax on deposit interest, there is another report form for the amount of income from the third category of securities and deposits. According to the current commercial law, the receipt of deposits is limited to financial institutions such as banks and money shops. Commercial firms receiving deposits is not permitted by law. However, in fact, commercial firms that receive deposits are common. If the third category of deposit interest income tax is only levied on formal financial institutions, the deposits of financial institutions will escape to commercial firms, which would be contrary to the government's intention to supervise financial institutions to protect depositors. Therefore, the current laws on income tax, based on the facts, levy taxes on commercial firms that receive deposits in the same way as financial institutions. The tax rate has also recently been reduced from 50 per mille to 40 per mille, as with financial institutions. This form is called the Report Form for Deposits Received by Commercial Firms. The term "commercial firm" should be interpreted broadly in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 of the General Rules for Merchants. All companies, commercial firms, commercial depots, factories, and for-profit individuals mentioned in Article 46 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations that receive deposits should fill out this report form. The method of preparing this form is explained below:

(1) Commercial Firm Name, Address, Industry, Telephone: In accordance with Articles 85 and 46 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, all companies, commercial firms, commercial depots, factories, and for-profit individuals should fill in their commercial firm name, address, and business type in the Company Report Form and the Firm Report Form, respectively. The commercial firm name, address, and industry to be filled in in this form should be the same as those to be filled in in these report forms. As for the telephone number, it is filled in for the convenience of the collection authority in contacting the firm and has no great significance.

(2) Types of Deposits: The types of deposits received by ordinary commercial firms are nothing more than time deposits, demand deposits, and colleague savings. As for savings deposits, only savings banks and banks that also operate savings may receive them. According to Article 1 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, the third category of income tax, that is, the taxation of income from securities and deposit interest, the so-called "deposit" should be interpreted as deposited funds. However, according to the interpretation of the Ministry of Finance, the interest earned on disguised deposit loans between ordinary stores and individuals that are for the purpose of earning interest should also be taxed. Furthermore, according to Article 3 of the draft Notice on the Collection of Income from the Third Category of Securities and Deposits, the interest on funds borrowed by non-banking and money industries, commercial firms, groups, and individuals to companies and commercial firms should also be taxed. Therefore, regardless of whether the books record funds borrowed that do not come from banks or money shops as deposited funds or borrowed funds, they should be entered in this form, and time-limited borrowed funds and demand-limited borrowed funds should be added to the types of deposits. When ordinary commercial firms settle interest on borrowings or transactions with banks or money shops, they should pay all of the interest in full and may not withhold income tax on the interest. Therefore, such borrowings or transactions do not need to be entered in this form.

(3) Total Number of Depositors: The deposits entered in this form are the total number of accounts and the total amount of various types of depositors. There is no need to enter the name and amount of each account. For example, three time deposit accounts with a total deposit amount of 36,000 yuan. This number of accounts and total deposit amount should be based on the current situation on the date of entry. Regardless of how quickly the amount of the deposit changes, only the total amount on the date of entry needs to be entered, and there is no need to report any changes that occur in the future.

(4) Name of Responsible Person and Date of Entry: The year and date of entry are the year and date of entry of this form. According to Article 27 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, the withholding of the third category of income tax should be done by the person in charge of the business of the interest-paying institution. The name of the responsible person entered in this form should be the person in charge of the business who is responsible for withholding. The so-called person in charge of the business is the chairman of the board, manager, or factory owner, owner, etc. of companies, commercial firms, commercial depots, factories, etc. According to the current income tax system, the taxation of the first category of income, that is, the income of profit-making enterprises, is based on the principle of adopting the declaration method. The taxation of the second category of income, that is, income from salaries and remuneration, and the third category of income, that is, income from securities and deposits, is based on the principle of adopting the source taxation method. The income tax of the source taxation method should be withheld by the paying institution. According to Articles 18 to 20 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and Article 35 of the Detailed Rules for Implementation, if the responsible person for withholding fails to report within the time limit, or is negligent in reporting, or conceals the report, or makes a false report, or fails to pay the tax within the time limit, they will be subject to penalties. If the amount withheld is insufficient, they shall be liable for compensation. (To be continued)

Correction: What was published yesterday as the "Company Report Form" was mistakenly printed as the "Report Form for Deposits Received by Commercial Firms." This is hereby corrected.

### The Feast at Hong Gate

— Zhong Bao

Xiang Yu of Chu was a great man with high ambitions and great talent, but unfortunately, his capacity was too small and did not match his talent and ambition. Therefore, although he could achieve great fame, he ultimately suffered defeat and disgrace. He originally had many talented people under his command, but they gradually all went over to Gaozu of Han, because Xiang Yu was reluctant to reward people with high positions and generous salaries, and he was competitive, unwilling to admit that anyone's talent could surpass his own. Since they could not obtain substantial benefits nor receive respect, of course, no one was willing to work for him willingly. Gaozu of Han was the opposite. He had small ambitions (he only wanted children, jade, and silk, and had no intention of becoming emperor. He only had this intention later because others taught him), and small talent, but his capacity was large, he could tolerate people, employ people, and was willing to give people benefits. Therefore, the lower-level scholars were all happy to work for him, and thus he was able to be invincible in the world. What Xiang Yu learned was "the ability to defeat ten thousand enemies," so he was a good general. What Gaozu could do was trustworthiness and tolerance, so he was a great leader. Judging from these two men, it can be known that failure and success are not accidental. The Feast at Hong Gate was the greatest difficulty in Gaozu's life. The reason he was able to overcome this difficulty was entirely due to his ability to gain the support of talented people on a regular basis. When something happened, there were people willing to go through fire and water and work hard for him, so how could he not succeed?

During the reign of the tyrannical Second Emperor of Qin, heroes rose up in revolution. Liang, the uncle of Xiang Yu of Chu, in order to facilitate the call to arms, established Xin, the grandson of King Huai of Chu, as King of Chu, and everyone respected him as the common lord (in reality, he was a puppet). At that time, the Qin army was still very strong, and everyone was afraid of confronting them head-on. King Huai felt that the most important thing at the time was to destroy Qin, so when it came time to appoint generals to set out, he made an agreement with the generals, saying:

"Whoever enters Guanzhong first shall be king of Guanzhong."

The generals looked at each other, each with a difficult expression. Gaozu of Han, because he had woken up too early that day and lacked energy, was constantly yawning in the ranks and did not pay attention to what King Huai was saying. Unexpectedly, King Huai took a liking to him and kept looking at him several times, wanting to call him to go. This made Zhang Liang, who was standing behind Gaozu, very anxious. He did not know what method to use to remind Gaozu. He scratched his scalp a few times and came up with an idea. He stepped heavily on the back of Gaozu's shoe and whispered:

"You should say, 'I'll go.'"

"I'll go!" Gaozu said to King Huai as expected, but in fact, he still had no idea where he was going, but he believed that Zhang Liang's plan would not be wrong.

"I am also willing to go with Duke Pei (Gaozu was once supported by the people as the magistrate of Pei County, and people often called him Duke Pei)." Xiang Yu's ambition was the entire world. He looked down on the mere Qin state. He was now vying to go because he hated Qin for defeating his uncle's army, and he wanted to take revenge himself.

"That won't do! That won't do!" The old generals of King Huai were afraid that King Huai would agree to Xiang Yu, so they hurriedly stopped him anxiously. This was not a formal court, and many formalities could be disregarded. Everyone could speak freely. "Xiang Yu is fierce, cruel, and frivolous. He once conquered Xiangcheng, and all the people of Xiangcheng were buried alive by him, not one was left. No matter where he goes, there is always a great massacre. It is better to send a benevolent person to the west to uphold justice, to inform the elders of Qin, to subdue them with virtue, not with force. The elders of Qin have been tormented by their masters for a long time. If a truly benevolent person is sent, who does not mistreat them, Qin can certainly be broken. Xiang Yu is fierce, do not send him. Only Duke Pei has always been generous and is an elder statesman, qualified to go."

King Huai indeed only sent Gaozu west to conquer Qin and did not allow Xiang Yu to go. However, Xiang Yu was not so easily controlled. He did not listen to King Huai, turned around and killed a senior general, made himself senior general, and led the armies of the feudal lords to attack Qin from another route. At that time, Qin was attacking Julu, and Xiang Yu personally led troops to teach them a lesson. He saw that the feudal lords' armies were all useless things and did not rely on them. He led the Chu army alone across the Zhang River. After crossing the river, he sank all the boats, broke all the cooking pots, and burned all the houses where the soldiers lived, retaining only enough food for three days. Then he said to the soldiers:

"People say that we Chu people only know how to fight losing battles. How can we wipe out the shame without winning a battle? I believe that it is better for a man to die for wiping out the shame than to live in humiliation. I am determined to die rather than be humiliated. Chu soldiers, you should also have such ambition. Look, we only have three days of food, and all means of retreat have been cut off. If you want to survive, you must fight desperately. The road ahead is your only way to survive."

As Xiang Yu spoke, his bright, round eyes turned, and his majestic and sharp gaze shot into the body of every soldier. They were like being struck by electricity, and they immediately rose up in great rebellion, becoming excited and their courage increased a hundredfold. They fought nine major battles with the Qin army, cut off the Qin army's knowledge, and killed several Qin generals. The Qin army was utterly defeated and could not be salvaged.

At this time, many of the feudal lords' armies came to rescue Julu, building more than a dozen camps here and there, but they were all afraid of the Qin soldiers and dared not come forward. When the Chu soldiers and Qin soldiers were engaged in battle, the generals of the feudal lords' armies all climbed onto the camp walls to watch. They saw that the Chu soldiers were all fighting one against ten, men turned into bloody men, horses turned into bloody horses, and they were still fighting. Sometimes, when they saw until their eyes blurred, they only saw streaks of red light, and they simply could not distinguish between men, horses, and knives. The shouts of the Chu soldiers shook the sky, almost bursting their eardrums. They huddled together in fear, their teeth chattering constantly, everything seemed involuntary. Finally, the news of the Chu army's victory woke them up. Xiang Yu summoned them, and they were truly in awe of him. As they entered the camp gate, they knelt and walked in, and no one dared to look up at Xiang Yu. Thus, Xiang Yu became the true general of the feudal lords.

Xiang Yu led his mighty army into Qin. His personal demeanor was heroic, unparalleled in the world, but unfortunately, he only relied on his own strength, which was ultimately limited. As a result, he could not catch up with Gaozu of Han, who had many strategists and warriors under his command. Gaozu actually entered Guanzhong first, and even advanced further, conquering Xianyang and obtaining the entire Qin state. This made Xiang Yu very angry. He jumped up and broke his beloved halberd, cursing loudly:

"A toad wants to eat swan meat! What is your status, Liu Bang (Gaozu of Han's surname was Liu, and his given name was Bang)? A petty pavilion chief from Sishui, a rascal, dares to compete with me, Xiang Yu, for the world? You want to be King of Qin? Good, let me boil you first!"

Xiang Yu acted unreasonably and used force to enter Guanzhong.

On the other side, Gaozu of Han was still "completely clueless." He saw the magnificence of the Xianyang Palace and the charming beauty of Zhao Nü Weiji, and he was so happy that he beamed, his whole body paralyzed. He said to his attendants with a smile:

"Let me just live here."

Someone reported this to Fan Kuai and Zhang Liang, who hurriedly came to dissuade him:

"If Your Lordship is greedy today, you will lose the hearts of the people, and the great cause will be lost!"

Gaozu was reminded by them and immediately woke up. He hardened his heart and left the Xianyang Palace without even turning his head. He ordered people to hide all the treasures and wealth of the Qin state in the treasury, and let the women leave the palace to choose their own spouses freely. He preserved his own clean body and returned to the army camp at Bashang spotlessly. When the soldiers and people saw Gaozu's nobility, everyone admired and encouraged themselves. Gaozu also listened to Zhang Liang's advice and summoned the elders and heroes of the various counties to announce:

"The elders have suffered from the harsh laws of Qin for a long time! Those who slander are exterminated, and those who talk about matters are questioned. I also made an agreement with the feudal lords that whoever enters Guanzhong first shall be King of Guanzhong. Today, I entered first, so of course I am your king. I do not want any harsh laws that trouble the people, I only make three laws with the elders: those who kill will die, those who injure others and those who steal will be punished according to the severity of their crimes. The personnel will remain the same, without any changes. The reason I came is to eliminate harm for the elders, not to invade or be tyrannical. Do not be afraid! I am now returning to the army camp at Bashang, but only to wait for the feudal lords to make an agreement."

Gaozu sent people and Qin officials to announce this everywhere, and the Qin people were very happy, vying to send cattle, sheep, wine, and food to comfort the Han army, fearing that Gaozu would not be the King of Qin.

Xiang Yu arrived at Xixi. Gaozu only found out then. Gaozu thought that even if Xiang Yu came, he could not break the agreement without a reason, so he did not take it seriously at all. Cao Wushang, the Left Sima of Gaozu, was a petty person. He heard that Xiang Yu was angry and wanted to attack Gaozu. He believed that Gaozu could not defeat Xiang Yu. He wanted to reserve a position for himself in advance, so he willingly acted as a Han traitor and secretly told Xiang Yu:

"Come and deal with Duke Pei quickly! He wants to be King of Guanzhong, he has already made Ziying (the Qin king who newly surrendered to Gaozu) prime minister, and he wants all the treasures in the Qin palace."

"Tomorrow, feed the soldiers well and go break Duke Pei's army!" Xiang Yu was very angry when he heard the person's words and immediately ordered an attack on Gaozu.

"When Duke Pei lived in Shandong, he was greedy for wealth and fond of beautiful women. Today, when he entered Guanzhong, he took nothing, and favored no women, which shows that his ambition is not small. He is your opponent. Attack him quickly, do not miss the opportunity!" Xiang Yu's advisor Fan Zeng, having found out about Gaozu's affairs very clearly, took the opportunity to persuade Xiang Yu to take action as soon as possible.

(Fan Zeng was also a person with great talent but small capacity. He did not know that a person with small capacity cannot achieve anything. He believed that a person's failure was mostly caused by being plotted against by others. If he killed all those who surpassed him, he would be the number one in the world. He did not know that "one chicken dies, another chicken crows," and the talented people in the world cannot be killed. A person with small capacity is jealous of others, plots against others, and is mentally and physically exhausted all day long, which only hastens his own demise.)

Xiang Bo, the Left Yin of Chu and uncle of Xiang Yu, had always been on good terms with Zhang Liang. He hurriedly ran into the Han army at night, found Zhang Liang, and said in a panic:

"Brother, run quickly! Tomorrow, King Xiang will send a large army to attack Duke Pei. When the time comes, jade and stone will be burned together, and you will not survive! Brother has a great future and cannot make useless sacrifices. Come with me quickly!"

"Duke Pei has treated me very well. Today, he is in trouble, and I will run away. This is not something a righteous man should do. I must tell him this news."

Without waiting for Xiang Bo to agree, Zhang Liang ran into Gaozu's tent and told him everything.

"What should I do? What should I do?" Gaozu jumped up from the bed in shock and kept asking.

"Who gave you the plan to anger King Xiang?"

"A scholar. He said that if I guarded the pass and did not let the feudal lords' armies in, I could be king of the entire Qin territory. Therefore, I listened to his words." Gaozu said regretfully.

"Your Majesty, think for yourself, can your army defeat King Xiang?"

"Of course not." Gaozu replied disappointedly.

"Then, how can you argue with him? Please go see Xiang Bo and say that Duke Pei dares not betray King Xiang."

"How do you know Xiang Bo?"

"This matter dates back to before the fall of Qin.

He was friends with me. He killed someone and was sentenced to death. I saved him, so today, in an emergency, he came to tell me."

"Who is older?"

"He is older than me."

"Please invite him for me, so that I may treat him like an elder brother."

Zhang Liang came out to invite Xiang Bo. Xiang Bo could not refuse out of consideration for their friendship and had to go see Gaozu. Gaozu laid out a grand feast to entertain Xiang Bo, raised his wine cup to wish him a long life, and made a marriage alliance with him. Gaozu first persuaded him, and then said the main point:

"I heard that someone is speaking ill of me in front of the general. In fact, I have done nothing to offend the general. When I entered Guanzhong, I took nothing, registered the people, and sealed the treasury to await the general. The reason I sent a general to guard the pass was to guard against thieves and other accidents. I have been waiting for the general day and night, how dare I rebel? I hope you will tell the general that I dare not betray virtue!"

"Do not worry, I can speak on your behalf, but you must come early tomorrow to apologize to King Xiang!" Xiang Bo, this honest man, believed Gaozu's words and comforted him with a look of pity.

"Of course, I will definitely go early." Gaozu replied with a very respectful manner.

Xiang Bo did not dare to delay and returned at night, telling Xiang Yu the truth and advising him:

"If Duke Pei had not broken through Guanzhong first, how could you have entered? It is unjust to attack someone who has made great contributions. It is better to treat him kindly because of this."

Xiang Yu agreed.

At that time, Gaozu's army was at Bashang, with only 100,000 men; Xiang Yu's army was at Hong Gate in Xinfeng, with 400,000 men. If they really fought, Gaozu would certainly not be able to defeat Xiang Yu.

The next day, Gaozu brought a hundred horsemen to Hong Gate to see Xiang Yu. When Xiang Yu saw that Gaozu had actually come to apologize in person, he felt relieved. (A person with small capacity, the most important thing is that others are willing to yield to him. Once they yield to him, he thinks he has won, he is satisfied, and he has no intention of blaming or guarding against others.) Gaozu said to Xiang Yu the words he had learned from Zhang Liang the night before:

"I and the general worked together to attack Qin. The general fought north of the river, and I fought south of the river. Unexpectedly, I entered Guanzhong and broke through Qin first, and was able to meet the general here again. Today, there are petty people sowing discord, causing the general to doubt me. I have always loved and respected the general and do not want to hurt the general's heart because of my unworthiness, so I have come here to apologize in person."

"This was all said by your Left Sima Cao Wushang. Otherwise, how would Ji (Xiang Yu's given name) have doubted you?"

Xiang Yu held a banquet for Duke Pei that day. Xiang Yu and Xiang Bo sat facing east, Fan Zeng sat facing south, Duke Pei sat facing north, and Zhang Liang sat facing west as an attendant. Fan Zeng originally wanted to end Gaozu's life at the banquet. During the drinking, he gave Xiang Yu several glances, and also took the jade jue he wore and raised it three times, hinting that Xiang Yu should make a decision immediately and order Gaozu to be killed. Xiang Yu thought to himself, "What can this poor wretch Duke Pei do? It is not chivalrous to kill him, let him go." Therefore, he remained silent and ignored Fan Zeng. Seeing that Xiang Yu was unwilling to take action, Fan Zeng had to come out himself and find Xiang Yu's cousin Xiang Zhuang, saying to him:

"The king is too soft-hearted, truly a mistake! It is better for us to do it ourselves. Go in and offer a toast, and after the toast, kill Duke Pei at the banquet, otherwise we will be captured by him one day."

Xiang Zhuang entered to offer a toast. After the toast, he requested Xiang Yu:

"The king is entertaining Duke Pei, and there is nothing to entertain with in the army. Please allow me to dance with a sword!"

"Good." Xiang Yu did not know Xiang Zhuang's intention, thinking that he truly wanted to entertain the guest, so he agreed.

Xiang Zhuang drew his sword and began to dance, the tip of the sword often pointing at Gaozu, wanting to find an opportunity to assassinate him. Seeing that this was not right, Xiang Bo was afraid that Xiang Zhuang would cause trouble, so he also got up to dance with a sword, often using his body to shield Gaozu. The situation was very tense. Zhang Liang hurriedly ran out of the army gate to find Fan Kuai to protect him.

"What is happening today?" Fan Kuai asked anxiously when he saw Zhang Liang.

"It is extremely urgent! Today, Xiang Zhuang is dancing with a sword at the banquet, and his intention is often directed at Duke Pei."

"Then, he wants to kill Duke Pei! Let me go in and fight him."

Fan Kuai immediately entered with a sword. The guards at the army gate, holding halberds, stopped him from entering. He knocked down the guards with his shield, broke free and ran in, leaning against the curtain and standing facing west, angrily staring at Xiang Yu with a pair of red, round eyes, looking as if he wanted to swallow him. Xiang Yu was startled and hurriedly knelt down (in ancient times, people sat on the ground, kneeling was to raise the body, preparing to get up easily) and asked with a sword:

"What does this guest want?"

"He is Duke Pei's charioteer, Fan Kuai," Zhang Liang replied.

At this time, because a new guest had entered, the sword dance was temporarily stopped, but Duke Pei had already lost his mind completely.

"He is a brave man, give him a large cup to drink." Xiang Yu ordered.

Fan Kuai thanked him and got up, drinking the wine.

"Give him a shoulder of pork." Xiang Yu ordered again.

They gave Fan Kuai a raw pork shoulder. Fan Kuai placed the shield on the ground, put the pork shoulder on the shield, and cut it with his sword to eat.

"Brave man, can you still drink?" Xiang Yu asked.

"I do not avoid death, what is a cup of wine to refuse?" Fan Kuai could no longer bear it and took the opportunity to say everything he wanted to say all at once: "The King of Qin had the heart of a tiger and wolf, and did his best to kill the innocent, so the world betrayed him. King Huai made an agreement with the feudal lords that whoever broke through Qin and entered Xianyang first would be King of Qin. Today, Duke Pei broke through Qin and entered Xianyang first, and dared not take anything, sealing the palace and garrisoning at Bashang, to await the King. Therefore, the reason for sending a general to guard the pass was to guard against other thieves and accidents. His hard work and achievements are so great, and yet there has been no reward for him, and the King actually listens to the words of petty people and wants to kill those who have contributed. This is exactly the continuation of the fall of Qin, and I humbly believe that the King should not do this."

He spoke with righteousness and strength, so that Xiang Yu could not answer. Xiang Yu had to change his expression, treat him with courtesy, and invite him to sit with Zhang Liang. After sitting for a while, Gaozu wanted to get up to relieve himself, and Zhang Liang and Fan Kuai followed him out. At this time, the banquet had not ended, and Xiang Yu sent the captain Chen Ping to invite Gaozu back. Gaozu wanted to leave, but he also wanted to turn back, not knowing what to do. He asked Zhang Liang and Fan Kuai:

"I want to leave, but I have not said goodbye, what should I do?"

"Great actions do not concern themselves with small details, and great ceremonies do not decline small concessions. Today, others are the knife and chopping board, and we are the fish and meat, what is there to decline?"

Fan Kuai wanted Gaozu to leave immediately, so Gaozu left Zhang Liang to apologize for him.

"What gifts did the King bring?" Zhang Liang asked.

"I brought a pair of white jade bi to offer to King Xiang: a pair of jade dou to offer to Yafu (Fan Zeng, King Xiang respected him as Yafu). They have always been angry, and I dare not offer them. Now, please offer them for me!" Gaozu instructed Zhang Liang in this way.

"Good, let me offer them."

Xiang Yu's army camp and Gaozu's were forty li apart. Gaozu decided not to ride in a carriage, but to ride a horse, bringing Fan Kuai, Xiahou Ying, Jin Qiang, and Ji Xin, four people who walked behind him carrying swords and shields, walking from Lishan, through the Jian path in Zhiyang. Before leaving, Gaozu said to Zhang Liang:

"From this road to our army camp, it is only twenty li. You guess that I have already arrived before you come to see King Xiang."

Gaozu left for a long time. Zhang Liang guessed that he had already arrived at the army camp before he entered to apologize, saying: "Duke Pei drank a few too many cups and could not bear it, he was so drunk that he could not say goodbye in person, so he respectfully sent his servant Liang to offer a pair of white jade bi, bowing twice to the feet of the great king: a pair of jade dou, bowing twice to the feet of the great general."

"Where is Duke Pei now?" Xiang Yu asked.

"Duke Pei heard that the Great King intended to reprimand him, he was afraid, and left alone, thinking that he has already arrived at the army camp."

Xiang Yu said nothing, took the white jade bi, and casually placed it on his seat. Fan Zeng received the jade dou, angrily threw it on the ground, drew his sword and smashed them, sighing:

"Alas! This boy is not worth planning with, the one who will seize King Xiang's world will definitely be Duke Pei. We will all be captured by him today."

As soon as Gaozu returned to the army camp, he killed Zeng Wushang. A few days later, Xiang Yu led his troops west to slaughter Xianyang, killing the surrendered Qin prince Ziying, setting fire to the Afang Palace, and burning it for three months, the fire still not abating. Xiang Yu took the treasures and women, loaded them full and went east, seizing them and returning to his hometown. Someone said to King Xiang:

"The passes in Guanzhong are dangerous and can be used as a barrier, with Hangu Pass in the east, Wu Pass in the south, San Pass in the west, and Xiao Pass in the north to resist enemies. At the same time, the land is fertile and the people are wealthy, which can be developed. Building a capital and establishing a country here is truly the undertaking of a hegemon."

Xiang Yu did not listen because he saw that the Qin palaces were already broken and uninhabitable, and he also missed his homeland very much. He said:

"If you do not return to your hometown when you are rich and noble, it is like wearing brocade clothes and traveling at night, who will see it?"

The person who spoke to Xiang Yu sighed with him: "People say that Chu people are monkeys who wash their heads and wear hats, it is completely true!"

Someone told Xiang Yu about this sentence, and Xiang Yu was angry and boiled the person who said it to death.

Fan Zeng recognized that Xiang Yu could not be done with, and bid farewell to return home. He was so angry that he could hardly walk. On the way, a carbuncle grew on his back and he died.

(Although Xiang Yu was temporarily prosperous, in the end, he acted alone and could not defeat Gaozu, who had the help of many people.)

Publishing World

### Talking About National Maps

— Chen Tianze

Geography is the study of the relationship between human life and the natural environment, and the most important tool for studying geography is the map. All advanced countries in the world strive for precision and detail in the compilation and drawing of maps, and the division of colors in their compilation and drawing used to be based on political regions, but now it has progressed to using colors to represent the contour lines of topography, and from the height of the terrain, to explore the water systems, mountain ranges, as well as the climate, population, customs, language, agricultural products, mineral products, transportation, commercial ports, and other conditions. This is a major progress in map compilation and drawing, and it is also a more beneficial tool for geography researchers.

In recent years, the map compilation and drawing industry in our country has been more prosperous and more advanced than in previous years. For example, in addition to those published by the Commercial Press, the China Book Company, the Kaiming Bookstore, the World Bookstore, and the Zhengshu Bookstore, there are also academic societies specializing in map research and compilation, such as the "World Geography Society," the "Oriental Geography Society," and the "Shanghai Geography Society." According to statistics, the number of maps published about our country, including wall maps, provincial maps, detailed local maps, as well as population density maps, boundary change maps, transportation maps, and agricultural, forestry, and livestock distribution maps, is only a few dozen types, all of which are for general practical use and as tools for geography courses in primary and secondary schools. Compared with European, American, and Japanese countries, the total number of items printed and compiled is far from comparable, but the trend of map progress gradually adopts topographic maps with contour lines and color layers, which can be said to be in line with scientific methods.

The national maps needed today certainly require the above-mentioned standards in their compilation and drawing, and there are several points that our people hope should be noted, as listed below: (to be continued)

### Group Consultations

— Dade

"Group weddings" have already been held many times, because this can save a lot of material resources, while still having a grand wedding, and can be personally certified by the mayor, so it is convenient for society, and a very large number of people participate in each session.

Medical treatment and marriage are equally important events in life, but some people become ill and cannot find a suitable doctor. Or, if one person has several kinds of diseases, they have to run around to seek treatment, wouldn't that waste a lot of material resources. Therefore, some people ideally want to gather famous doctors in Shanghai in one place to provide group consultations, so that patients no longer have the difficulty of searching, nor the waste of running around. Now, this ideal has actually been realized. This is the Wu Zhou Pharmacy, which has specially invited experts to design and equip complete consulting rooms in the main building of the main store. All internal and external departments are staffed by the top-notch doctors in Shanghai. The Wu Zhou main store building is located in the middle of the Four Horses Road, with very convenient transportation, and the consulting room is equipped with a prescription collection point. After the diagnosis, the prescription is immediately filled, and you can take it back to take the medicine. With such thoughtful service, patients will certainly find it convenient and will enthusiastically participate.

### A True Proof of Friendship

— I

While Japanese Foreign Minister Sato delivered a speech on diplomatic policy in the House of Peers, our newly appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wang Chonghui, also issued a statement on policy toward Japan in Nanjing. However, Minister Wang's statement was more abstract and simpler than Foreign Minister Sato's. Nevertheless, it was his first time expressing opinions as a diplomat, and he could only outline the general direction of diplomatic policy, unable to provide detailed and specific explanations. This is indeed the appropriate stance for a diplomat.

The speeches given by former General Hayashi Senjūrō in the Diet and the remarks made by Naotake Satō after becoming Foreign Minister represent an important Japanese position and attitude toward foreign relations. Foreign Minister Wang's statement, made just hours after Satō announced a similar attitude in the House of Peers, revealed a new path and points of agreement in the diplomatic posture of the two countries, despite its abstract wording. It can be confidently stated that the two countries will engage in concrete negotiations based on the spirit of friendship and mutual benefit.

However, so-called friendship, equality, and mutual benefit cannot be used as empty words to evade responsibility; they must be based on facts. Now, we must observe whether Japan's friendship is genuine or feigned, whether its mutual benefit is real or merely lip service, and whether its equality is sincere or simply a facade. We must first look at the North China issue. If Japan is truly sincere and genuine, it should abolish the pseudo-organization in eastern Hebei, which is neither fish nor fowl; eliminate the Political Council of Hebei and Chahar, which infringes upon our national sovereignty; and dismantle the so-called special zone bordering China, Japan, and "Manchukuo," which violates China's territorial rights. Only by doing so can Japan demonstrate its genuine spirit of friendship. Otherwise, no matter how pleasing its pronouncements may be, they are nothing but empty words.

However, Foreign Minister Satō Naotake's speech in the House of Peers was not made rashly. The gist of his speech must have been approved by Prime Minister Hayashi Senjūrō, Army Minister Sugiyama Gen, and Navy Minister Mitsumasa Yonai. Ōkōchi's questions also seemed to have been agreed upon beforehand, providing Satō with an opportunity to deliver his speech. Judging from this, Satō Naotake's speech must have considerable value. It is not merely about uttering pleasantries to win the satisfaction and praise of the audience while disregarding the facts or allowing the facts to be completely contrary to the words. Given the Foreign Minister's position and the speech's widespread publicity, it should have considerable value.

Now that we have heard Foreign Minister Satō Naotake's grand pronouncements, we eagerly await to see the methods of so-called Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and Japan's attitude toward North China. We will watch closely with anticipation.

Historical Story

### The Fisherman's Death

— Chen Ruhui

The fisherman rowed his boat and sang:

“The sun has set,
But sorrow fills my heart;
The moon has risen,
Yet why haven't I crossed the river?”

Wu Zixu heard the song and knew the pursuers were far behind. He led Prince Sheng out of the reeds and to the riverbank. The fisherman's boat was indeed quietly waiting there. He picked up the prince and jumped into the boat. The fisherman turned the oars, and with a splash, the boat glided into the river.

The vast expanse of the river, shrouded in mist, concealed the opposite shore. The boat floated like a leaf, moving upstream. The fisherman's hair was gray, but he rowed like a strong man. Wu Zixu, who had been terrified day and night, finally felt at peace. None of them spoke. He and the prince stared at the fisherman rowing, who only focused on the rise and fall of his oars.

In less than two hours, they crossed the river, reaching the territory of Wu. Wu Zixu carried the prince ashore first. The fisherman secured the boat and followed. Before Wu Zixu could thank him, the fisherman said:

"General, you must be hungry. Let me fetch some food."

Wu Zixu watched the fisherman's hurried departure with suspicion. "He's running off so quickly. Could he be reporting us to someone to capture us? But why did he ferry us across the river? I should hide." He pulled the prince and hid in the reeds again.

Soon, the fisherman returned with a food basket, but they were nowhere to be seen on the riverbank. He thought, "They couldn't have gone far in just a moment. They must be hiding somewhere." He looked around, seeing only dense reeds swaying in the wind. "They're probably in here. Let me call them out." The fisherman sang:

"People in the reeds,
People in the reeds,
Are you just poor scholars in distress?
Why do you avoid me?"

Wu Zixu heard the call and peeked out, seeing only the fisherman. He led the prince out and took the food from the fisherman, quickly devouring it on the riverbank. He was deeply grateful to the fisherman and didn't know how to thank him. He thought for a moment and decided to take off his sword and give it to the fisherman. He said respectfully:

"Thank you, old man, for saving our lives and helping us escape the clutches of Chu. We will never forget this great kindness. But I have no gold or silver with me, only this sword for protection. Please accept it as a token of my gratitude..."

"Haha!" The fisherman's laughter interrupted him. He pushed the sword back with his left hand. "General Wu, you underestimate me. I saved you because you are a hero, not because you have this sword. Haha..."

The fisherman's cold laughter burned Wu Zixu's face. Wu Zixu held the sword, unsure what to do.

"General Wu, you know that the King of Chu has offered a reward for your capture. I didn't take it, so would I accept this sword? General, take the prince and go quickly. We'll meet again." The fisherman's solemn attitude and sharp words stunned Wu Zixu. Ashamed, he put away the sword, still staring blankly as the fisherman turned to leave. Suddenly, he remembered something and shouted:

"Old man, wait! May I ask your name, so I can repay your kindness in the future?"

The fisherman turned his head, but didn't answer, muttering to himself: "What repayment? That doesn't sound like a hero."

But Wu Zixu still didn't leave. He took a step forward, timidly saying:

"Then, old man—please don't tell anyone about me!"

Upon hearing this, the fisherman turned around again, his face turning green with anger. He bit his trembling lip and glared at Wu Zixu before saying:

"General Wu, rest assured; I will die before revealing your whereabouts."

The fisherman boarded the boat. Seeing that Wu Zixu still wouldn't turn around, he angrily shouted:

"You must see me die to feel at ease? Fine! Fine! Fine! I didn't expect General Wu to be so petty."

Wu Zixu was startled and was about to explain when he saw the fisherman spread his arms, brace his feet against the gunwale, and with a single push, the boat capsized, trapping the fisherman underneath. A swift current swept away the man and the boat, disappearing into the twilight.

### The Secret Talk of Two Young Ladies

— Shun

The door was tightly closed, and two young ladies were whispering inside!

Miss Jiang: I asked you on the road earlier why your complexion has become so sallow recently. Why didn't you tell me?

Miss Liu: It wasn't convenient to talk on the road. I'll tell you now. It's because my menstruation has been irregular for some time. I often feel weak in my lower back and legs, with abdominal distension and headaches. I didn't pay much attention to it. But recently, these symptoms have increased, causing me great physical and mental suffering! That's why my appearance looks so haggard!

Miss Jiang: Oh, so that's what it is. You just need to buy 'Yue Yue Hong' (Monthly Red) from the Wuzhou Pharmacy. It will regulate your menstruation, and you can regain your health and beauty.

Miss Liu: How do you know this medicine is so effective?

Miss Jiang: I used to suffer from difficult menstruation myself. Later, I relied on 'Yue Yue Hong' to cure my condition.

### The Uncrowned Emperor Maintains a Small Court in England

— Special

Tears fall as he surveys his lost kingdom, unable to bear the memories.

Haile Selassie, the Emperor of Abyssinia, hailed as the Lion of Judah, the King of Kings, currently resides in a grey stone house atop a small hill, ruling over an area of merely two acres. He once said frankly, "When a mortal is troubled, the place where he lives is indeed unsatisfactory." However, he remains as confident in his future as he was when he resided in Addis Ababa (the capital), still harboring the hope of restoring his imperial rule. Although his palace in Abyssinia has been occupied by Italian soldiers, he continues to maintain a small court in the English countryside. Among his few loyal courtiers, his words still carry the weight of law, but beyond the garden gate, he has no authority.

Since the King of Italy added the title of Emperor of Abyssinia to his name, the recent edition of the Gotha Almanac has removed several pages of the Abyssinian royal family. This uncrowned emperor currently resides quietly in a villa built on a steep hillside, overlooking the spa town of Bath. Surrounded by lush trees, it is very peaceful. He lives a secluded life, rarely appearing in public and seldom meeting with local society ladies. Those who wish to see him must still observe the formalities of a court audience, announcing themselves outside the door before being led by a seven-foot-tall guard into a large square room. The emperor, with a furrowed brow, spends his days in this room. A map of his ravaged kingdom hangs on the wall, shelves are filled with books, and documents are scattered on his desk. He often stands quietly by the window, gazing at the ancient city of Bath, built centuries ago by the ancestors of his enemies when they invaded England. In the next room, several of his staff members are typing letters. He is still spending his private funds to maintain Abyssinian embassies in London, Paris, and Geneva, keeping a steady flow of correspondence.

Although his guards have changed into smart Savile Row suits, he himself still wears a black robe, white trousers, and a flat cap, an outfit that has become familiar worldwide through newsreels. Since leaving Addis Ababa and fleeing abroad, his demeanor has not changed much. He still greets guests with familiarity, but he expects those introduced to him to address him as "Your Majesty."

An Associated Press reporter once visited him. He told the reporter, "I will never abandon my hope." He denied rumors of moving elsewhere in Europe, saying, "Since being forced to leave my country, the British have treated me very well. I have decided to stay here for now. I still hope to return to Abyssinia one day."

Although he acknowledged that the government of the Galla people no longer exists, he maintained that in areas not occupied by the Italian army, there is still an administrative organization representing the emperor. He said proudly, "In those territories, my people are still fighting to preserve their freedom." The reporter asked, "Would Your Majesty be willing to return to Abyssinia under Italian protection?" He shrugged and replied, "If the League of Nations so directs." The reporter then asked, "Does Your Majesty still believe in the League of Nations?" "We often hope to receive something somewhat satisfactory from the League of Nations," was his simple answer. The Emperor declined to discuss his financial situation, but it is generally believed that he has spent a considerable amount of money maintaining his embassies and retaining his staff. He recently sold a batch of silver in London, receiving about 2,500 British pounds. He spoke of this, saying that he was forced to take this step due to circumstances. He added, "I don't need money now, because there are no social obligations here."

### Lock

— Shen Bing

I locked up my shabby trunk and pitiful drawers with careful locks. Every day, I held a string of clanging keys in my hand, feeling as triumphant as someone who possessed great wealth. However, locks represent humanity's shame, cunning, and sorrow.

My old rattan trunk held outdated short shirts, a woolen lined robe that my father gave me—my father's build was similar to mine, but it was too cramped for me—and all the clothes I had worn for everyday and social life over the years. Clothes eaten through by silverfish, scorched by cigarette butts. All permeated with the scent of mothballs, all permeated with ancient memories. Yet I had no careful intention when carefully locking the trunk.

My drawers were messy. Everything was temporary and haphazard. Every weekend, seeing the chaotic state of the drawers, I wrung my hands like an incompetent doctor. The ink bottle, forlornly thrown into a corner, wore a sorrowful face, complaining about the dust on its neck. The writing paper lamented its broken spine, dripping ink stains, and its fate in the despised wastebasket—the writing paper with its precisely cut, difficult-to-fill blank spaces. The incomplete inkstone, the crippled Huizhou inkstick, the bald brush that had shared joys and sorrows with me over the years, all glared at their master with resentment. Helplessly, I wrung my hands.

The shabby trunk and pitiful drawers were hidden away like precious silver.

I locked up my shabby trunk and pitiful drawers with careful locks. Every day, I held a string of clanging keys in my hand, feeling as triumphant as someone who possessed great wealth. However, locks represent humanity's shame, cunning, and sorrow.

China-West (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM

Opening: "Bao Yu Mourns at the Funeral"

Fragrant smoke gently fills the incense burner. Dim and faint, the white candles flicker. The white spiritual canopy is hung high. The burning ingots and silk become ashes. The tall wooden tablet sits in the middle. The silent paper servants stand on both sides. Ash-covered sacrificial offerings. Cold and iced, a bowl of soup. A dark black five-foot coffin. The flashing seven lamps give a dim yellow light. Bitter, sad, sad, Zi Juan, the maid. Tearful eyes shed two rows of tears. The passionate son approaches, walking slowly. Sorrowful and melancholy, his heart is filled with sadness. Step by step, he enters the mourning hall. Sobbing, his voice cracks his heart. Softly, he calls out to Sister Lin. Listen carefully, I will tell you the details from the beginning. Our love was intimate as we read the Romance of the Western Chamber together. Our feelings were strong as we wrote poems together among the crabapple blossoms. Angrily, I buried the fallen flowers in the garden. Hastily, I came to comfort her sorrow. Wearily and sickly, her delicate body couldn't bear it. Exhausted and lost, she lay on her small ivory bed. Late at night, I visited her in the Xiaoxiang Pavilion. The fan blows by the stove, brewing medicinal soup. She always wished to be united in marriage. But fate was thin, and it all became a dream. Joyfully, flower candles were lit in the hall. Looking closely, little did she know that it was a substitute. Confused and dazed, she stood unsteadily. Her spirit wandering and drifting away. Resentfully, she hated Sister-in-law Er. Fiercely, her hands were ruthless, and her heart was poisonous. Wickedly, people's hearts are not ancient. Hypocritically, she deceived me into becoming the groom. Don't blame me for being too heartless. It's difficult to repay, difficult to prolong your life. In a vast expanse, you have already returned to the Yellow Springs. Crying, what incense can bring back the soul? Hair shaved, I wish to enter the empty gate. Far, far away, leaving behind the old hometown. Constantly, quietly listening to the sound of the wooden fish. Again and again, in the next life, may we be mandarin ducks. Heart sore, how can I think of everything? May your soul ascend to heaven. Heart filled with regret, I will spend my time in the monastery.

(1) Brother, you are going to the battlefield. Little sister is truly heartbroken. Holding onto the corner of brother's clothes. Sending brother on the road. For brother's warm heart. I have a few words to say. (2) Brother, you are going to fight. Don't fire your gun carelessly. Aim carefully before you act. The enemy will have a hard time hurting you. For brother's strong spirit. Everything must be done with careful courage. (3) Brother, you are going to the battlefield. Don't miss your hometown. Rush forward regardless of everything. Then you will definitely win. For brother's long ambition. Everything must be thought about carefully.

### Afterglow

The Nightingale Art Society, silenced in the air due to the influence of objective circumstances, urgently wanted to revitalize itself. However, due to the constraints of the members' professions, it still could not be realized.

Since the Nightingale Art Society could not broadcast as desired, Manna and Lucy, who had long been loved by art enthusiasts, were unwilling to succumb to the threat of circumstances. Therefore, they gathered a group of art comrades and automatically formed the Manlu Art Society.

The organizational system of the Manlu Art Society is divided into: (1) Singing Group (2) Music Group (3) Drama Group (4) Literary Group. The four departments currently decided are: the Singing Group started broadcasting popular songs on the 8th at Linji Radio Station (KC 1220) from 9:05 PM to 9:50 PM every night.

What I want to tell readers here is that the Manlu Art Society is a purely art-oriented group, so they will have many more departments in the future. Feeling the need for collective research, they are now publicly recruiting several amateur male and female members. If comrades who love art are willing to participate, please send a detailed address to Gu Jialu, Hengmao Elementary School, Hengmao Lane, Eight Immortals Bridge, Shanghai.

The "Chinese Harmonica World," published by the Chinese Harmonica World Publishing House, Volume 3, Issue 2, was published yesterday. The publication has always been recognized by harmonica music lovers as the only harmonica music magazine in the country, so its sales have spread throughout the country. The content of this issue is even richer, with two famous songs: (1) Yu Yuxing's arrangement of "Allegro" (2) Bao Mingshan's arrangement of "Spring Song." The text includes Jin Yangzhi's "Harmony Playing Method," Yunlong's "Opening to the Study of Harmonica Music," Fu Shu's "The Origin of Opera," Chen Xin's "Theory of Tone Fusion," Song Tao's "Anecdotes and Appreciation of Music," and so on. Each article is extremely wonderful. The annual subscription fee for twelve issues, including postage, is only six jiao. The address of the publishing house is Lane 157, Anren Street, Xinbeimen, Shanghai.

Film

### Star Magazine

"Gone With the Wind," directed by Zhang Shichuan and starring Hu Die, is ready and will begin filming as soon as "Street Angel," directed by Yuan Muzhi, is completed.

"Gone With the Wind" depicts a young widowed woman who, although unwilling to sacrifice her precious youth under the cannibalistic old ethics, is willing to sacrifice her happiness for the sake of great love—love for her deceased husband and love for her five-year-old daughter—and falls into this contradictory and inextricable painful situation. The story is extremely tortuous and tragic, and the script is by Professor Hong Shen.

Ms. Wu Jiamou, who was an actress at the Star Film Company ten years ago, visited the Star Company yesterday and made contact with her friends regarding the establishment of the Huai'an Cinema.

In Shen Xiling's "Crossroads," Zhao Dan plays a young man pursuing light and progress. After getting a job, he is not afraid of hardship and does extra work to the best of his ability. Colleagues, jealous, mock him: "You're working so hard, don't you want your life?" His reply is: "It's better to suffer than to have no food to eat." However, he still cannot keep his job and soon becomes unemployed again.

Zhou Xuan sang a "Longing Song" in "Street Angel," which was very beautiful. It expressed her melancholy of "being a young woman alone, still without a husband."

### The Grand Light Presents "The Mystery of the Foggy Night Rescue"

Comparable to "The Mystery of the Foggy Night Corpse" starring Coleen Moore

Many fans still remember, two years ago, Coleen Moore starred in a film called "The Mystery of the Foggy Night Corpse," which caused a sensation when it was released in Shanghai. Now, this story of "The Mystery of the Foggy Night Rescue," Bulldog Drummond Escapes, follows the plot of "The Mystery of the Foggy Night Corpse," telling how the great detective nicknamed "Mad Dog" Drummond, on a foggy night in London, solves two bizarre cases and rescues a beautiful woman. It is even more thrilling and bizarre than "The Mystery of the Foggy Night Corpse." The stars of this film are LeMyrun, the star of "Queen of the Jungle," Sir C. Aubrey Smith, and Zita Johann, produced by Paramount Pictures, and will be released at the Grand Light Theater starting today.

### "Song of a Loving Mother"

A new model for ethical films

Those with filial piety can watch "Song of a Loving Mother" and examine themselves without shame, knowing how to improve themselves. Those who are naturally rebellious can watch "Song of a Loving Mother" and be warned to improve quickly and become complete people. It gives people moral enlightenment and artistic comfort.

The performance of "Song of a Loving Mother" is done in a very popular form, like casual conversation, while the story is winding and touching, making it easy for every audience member to accept.

There is also a famous Western film called "Mother," which caused a worldwide sensation and was welcomed by people all over the world. Audiences who have seen the Western film "Mother" should especially watch "Song of a Loving Mother," because "Song of a Loving Mother" is written entirely with Eastern colors and Chinese sentiments, making it more considerate and delicate than the film "Mother."
