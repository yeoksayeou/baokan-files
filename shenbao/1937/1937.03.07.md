### Going to Bailingmiao (6)

‚Äî Our Reporter Qian Hua

Over a Hundred Li of Uninhabited Mongolian Grassland; Life of Soldiers on the Icy and Snowy Frontier

However, what we find most heartbreaking is that the enemy's war expenses of more than 10 million yuan were all allocated from the smuggled items of the Hebei-East Anti-Japanese Autonomous Council, and the guns, ammunition, and bombing aircraft used were all produced by the Shenyang Arsenal. Taking the money of the Chinese people to finance the mutual killing of Chinese people; using the military equipment made by the Chinese people to slaughter the Chinese people, what a cruel and brutal means! As for our gains from recovering Bailingmiao this time, in addition to the material aspects, there are three priceless treasures whose value is inestimable. The first is the "Using Troops Records" of Major General Morishima, the head of the special affairs agency, written in a diary style, all in Japanese, recording the crystallization of his thirty years of wandering in Mongolia. Many places are overlooked or unnoticed by others, but there are special records in the book; this place can be set up as a military fortress, and food can be stored there. The products and people of various small places have been investigated clearly. It is all his hard work and is truly a treasure on the march. The second is one military map at 1:50,000 scale, and one military map at 1:100,000 scale, measured with extraordinary precision and care. The scope of the map ranges from the various leagues and banners of Chahar-North, all the way to Gansu, Ningxia, and Lanzhou. Important places are explained in detail, also entirely in Japanese. Not even a single tree, a single piece of wood, a single river, or a single mountain has been missed. The military maps we use are far inferior to theirs. Taking the survey fee alone, it would cost at least several tens of millions of yuan. Even if the government had this large sum of money, they would be willing to spend it on surveying border maps, but in reality, there are no such specialized talents, so they can only sigh in vain. These two treasures, along with the still photos of the "Using Troops Records" play, have immeasurable value in the construction of national defense. The third is various planning documents of the enemy's invasion of the Northwest, with various insidious and vicious methods that make people shudder. Although the preliminary plan has been completely broken by us, the dream of ambitious people will never be fundamentally awakened because of this, and all pre-determined plans will be cancelled. Therefore, we must also work together with the people of the country and be careful to guard against them at all times, and the already leaked invasion planning documents can be used as a precious mirror for our prevention.

Talks with Soldiers on the Front Line

The soldiers on the Bailingmiao national defense line are all physically strong and mentally invigorated. What is most exciting is the soldiers' strong sense of national and ethnic consciousness, and the increase in general knowledge; they shout the slogan "Chinese people do not fight Chinese people," and have a clear understanding of the current enemy, and are willing to risk their flesh and blood and fight desperately with the enemy, and sacrifice for the freedom of the entire nation. This is a very pure and common sentiment among the soldiers on the front line. From this point alone, the theory that "China will not perish" already has a very solid foundation. The reporter spent two days in Bailingmiao with the soldiers, and they accompanied me everywhere, treating me with great hospitality, and speaking freely and without reservation. A kind of loyal, brave, sincere, and frank attitude is truly admirable and lovable. Most of them are old brothers from when General Fu was defending Zhuozhou, and they have extremely rich combat experience, and enduring hardship is their special skill. There was one company commander who, on the day when the bandit puppet army counterattacked Bailingmiao, led his brothers to bravely fight back. He was wounded on his left arm and his whole body was covered in blood, but he still shouted "Kill! Kill! Advance!" and refused to rest. Later, many brothers pulled him back and sent him to the Suiyuan Military Hospital. After two weeks of treatment, he had not fully recovered, but he hurriedly left the hospital, cancelled his leave, and returned to duty. He said to the reporter: "Soldiers are afraid of dying in vain. This is our only chance, how can we easily let it go." A few short words, how brave! Regarding their living conditions, I have written down fragments of the conversation below, so you can know a bit about them. Reporter (asked): Are your salaries paid on time every month? Is there any extra allowance during wartime? (Answer): Our monthly salary is 6 yuan in legal currency, and 5 yuan is deducted for food expenses. Fortunately, the salary is not in arrears at all. Since the outbreak of the Suiyuan War, all mobilized troops have received an additional 4 yuan in legal currency per month, as a temporary bonus. (Asked): How about the clothing? (Answer): In ordinary military camps, during the winter, every two soldiers share an old sheepskin coat. The soldier on duty wears the sheepskin coat outside, and the one not on duty warms themselves by the fire in the barracks. When sleeping at night, they cover themselves with the shared sheepskin coat to keep warm. Both sides are very careful to protect that old sheepskin coat, because if it is accidentally lost, two people will have to endure a freezing winter. This time, when the war broke out, the authorities made a sheepskin coat for each of us. It is light, warm, and free to wear. The brothers are really overjoyed. (Asked): What are your feelings about fighting the enemy this time? (Answer): We have participated in many civil wars in the past, and how many brothers and officers have sacrificed, but they are no different from dying like a dog. Once dead, it's over, and no one cares about you. The common people behind their backs will even spit and curse the lackeys of the warlords. Now it's different. How many people donate money, donate things, and how many people come to the front line to comfort and serve; if you are wounded and stay in the hospital, how many young ladies tenderly take care of us, send us money, and write us letters home; those who died in battle are buried in the cemetery for fallen soldiers and will forever enjoy the respect of the people of the whole country. How glorious! Therefore, in this war, not a single brother is not rushing forward desperately, only afraid that the superior will leave us in the rear and there will be no opportunity to sacrifice. We brothers have indeed had a major awakening, that is, we will never participate in meaningless infighting that kills each other. (Asked): The weather on the front line is so cold, don't the brothers feel pain? (Answer): This year, Mongolia is not too cold. We are used to living in cold places, so we don't feel it so much. Moreover, there is cattle and horse dung that can be burned for fire, and there are old sheepskin coats to keep out the wind, so we can always resist it. It is really cold at night and at dawn, especially when standing guard on the top of the mountain. After standing for ten minutes, the sensation of the whole body is frozen numb, and it is common to freeze ears and fingers. Therefore, the superiors are particularly considerate of us and stipulate that the time for guards to stand sentry is reduced from one hour to half an hour, and that can still be dealt with. (Asked): How about your diet? (Answer): We eat biscuits, steamed buns, and porridge, and just put some salt in it as a side dish. Anyway, we can eat enough. Can we still talk about good or bad! From this conversation, we can see the material suffering felt by the soldiers on the front line. Soldiers sacrifice their lives, and the people in the rear should donate as much as possible in terms of material resources so that they can live a more comfortable life. This is truly our obligation! When the reporter left Bailingmiao, this Chief of Staff Yuan specially sent me to the car, bidding farewell reluctantly. There were also many brothers who had been with me for several days, also urging the reporter to write more letters to them, reporting domestic and foreign news. The wheels were turning on the way back, and the mountains surrounding Bailingmiao gradually turned into black shadows, but the heroic attitude of the soldiers on the front line is still deeply imprinted in my mind and will never be erased.

### On Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation

‚Äî Wu Qiyu

Since the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet, the most noteworthy thing between China and Japan is naturally the news that Japan will promote economic cooperation with China and abandon political negotiations. This matter has very important significance in Sino-Japanese relations and must be discussed. Now I would like to offer some opinions.

Let us first discuss the nature of this Japanese proposal. As mentioned above, the Japanese proposal is to put forward economic cooperation and abandon political negotiations. In this topic, I think that the words "abandon political negotiations" are as important as "economic cooperation" or "partnership." Please allow me to explain the reason. Roughly speaking, everyone knows that within Japan, foreign policy toward China can be divided into two major factions. One faction advocates gradual progress, represented by industrialists and political parties. The other faction is radical, best represented by the military. From the September 18th Incident to the present, broadly speaking, the radical faction's diplomacy has naturally been in power. However, since last year, on the one hand, it was because of China's unyielding attitude toward Japan and the enthusiastic support of the government by the people during the Xi'an Incident. On the other hand, it was because of the expansion of military spending in the Japanese budget and the increasingly dangerous situation of Japan's international position after the establishment of the Japan-Germany Pact. Therefore, in January of this year, on the one hand, some people opposed the Hirota cabinet, and on the other hand, some people advocated slogans such as Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and changing Japan's policy toward China. As a result, when Hayashi Senjuro formed a cabinet this time, he invited Yuki Toyotaro, who had previously been the most active in promoting Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, to serve as Finance Minister and raised the slogan of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. This is the cause and course of this change in Japanese policy. But there is one point we must pay special attention to here. That is, although Yuki and others' promotion of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation this time may be full of concrete meaning, on the other hand, because of the characteristics of the Japanese constitution, and the actual position and policy of the military, he is powerless, or perhaps unwilling, to persuade or overcome the military, to return to China the illegal rights it has obtained in China, or to guarantee that it will no longer invade China. Therefore, they have no choice but to set aside the most difficult political issues between China and Japan and simply promote Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. In other words, what these people mean is that they cannot talk about political issues at the moment, so they have no choice but to maintain the status quo, "make no new demands," and instead try to cooperate economically to ease relations between China and Japan. I think this is the most important spirit of the Japanese proposal this time and is especially worthy of our attention.

Since the Japanese attitude is to abandon political negotiations and promote economic cooperation, what should our attitude be? Regarding this point, I think that although we deeply understand the sincerity of Yuki and others' proposal, we should not rashly agree to it. My reason is that a country's external relations, both political and economic aspects, are closely linked. Or perhaps it can even be said that they have unity, or are hardly divisible. In other words, a country's relationship with another country cannot be bad and conflicting in political terms, while at the same time cooperating or partnering in economic terms. This is an extremely clear principle. And in normal circumstances, political adjustment is a prerequisite for economic adjustment. Specifically, two countries must have no ill feelings in political terms, and must be able to respect each other's sovereignty, territory, and all other legitimate rights before they can talk about economic cooperation. But Japan has been extremely aggressive towards our country since the September 18th Incident, and the political relationship between China and Japan is very bad. Even recently, the Japanese have not stopped this aggression. The political relationship between China and Japan has not improved. And a few days ago, Hayashi Senjuro stated when answering questions from members of the Lower House that he agreed to the most aggressive Hirota Three Principles. Under these circumstances, from the Japanese side, although the promotion of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation by Yuki and others may be full of sincerity, from the perspective of the entire Japanese national position, it is compromising and invading at the same time, and is completely insincere. And from our side, if we accept this cooperation, there will definitely be no good results. Because this not only shows that we are an unambitious nation, but more importantly, the current economic cooperation, no matter how unrelated it is to politics, it will definitely be affected under bad political relations, and it can also become a tool and excuse to invade us in the future. Therefore, I think that if we accept the Japanese proposal for economic cooperation, we must have pre-emptive or exchange conditions. That is, the minimum adjustment or normalization of Sino-Japanese political relations. Specifically, the Japanese must return to China all the territory and other rights taken from us after the September 18th Incident. At least to the extent of restoring the administrative integrity of the Hebei and Chahar provinces, such as: „äÄ the abolition of the Hebei-East Anti-Japanese Autonomous Council, „äÅ the withdrawal of the bandit puppets in Chahar-North, „äÇ the suppression of smuggling, „äÉ the return of the troops increased beyond the purpose of the treaty, „äÑ the withdrawal of special affairs agencies in various places, „äÖ the abolition of the Tanggu and He-Umezu Agreements, etc. In addition, it is naturally necessary to guarantee that we will not be invaded in the future before we can talk about economic cooperation. Otherwise, without improving political relations, rashly talking about economic cooperation, I am afraid that we will still suffer in the future. Regarding this point, I think our foreign ministry should make subtle indications as soon as possible to probe the situation, in line with diplomatic customs.

Saying this, the reader will definitely feel that the future of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is hopeless. Because to achieve the above-mentioned preconditions, it is not only necessary for the unification of Japanese diplomacy, but also for the absolute dominance of the Japanese civilian faction. But there are many strange things in the world, and we don't have to despair. So we must continue to discuss the second point. That is, if Sino-Japanese economic cooperation becomes possible, what attitude should we take? Regarding this point, it is naturally a bit difficult to discuss now because we do not yet know the content of the other party's proposal. But from the perspective of economic principles and the Japanese repeated expressions, the so-called economic cooperation is nothing more than the following points. Namely: „äÄ the exchange of goods, „äÅ capital cooperation, „äÇ technical cooperation. So now I will briefly discuss these three aspects. „äÄ In terms of the exchange of goods, there are indeed many places where China and Japan are mutually dependent and can cooperate. But what we must pay attention to is that our current tariffs are already low enough and are not enough to protect industry. Therefore, in this regard, I think we should absolutely take our own interests as the standard. That is, while this kind of cooperation must take into account the supply and demand situation between the two countries, it must also take into account the cultivation and protection of our country's current and future industries, so as to prevent neighboring countries from using us as a dumping ground, or encouraging countries other than Japan to follow suit. As for the suppression of smuggling, which should be included in the political adjustment, it is a prerequisite, so I will not repeat it now. „äÅ Regarding the capital cooperation layer, this is a most difficult problem. Because it is really a factor in creating a balance of power among the great powers in the Far East. Therefore, when discussing this issue in the future, I think we should not only absolutely take care of our own interests, but also take care of the interests of the powers. When Britain sent Sir Otto Niemeyer to China the year before last, he proposed to the Japanese side to jointly assist China in economic terms. Japan did not agree because it had other intentions. I think this is a more appropriate approach, and we should try to make it happen in time, so as to avoid someone monopolizing it. „äÇ Regarding technical cooperation, our country is now carrying out economic construction and needs talents everywhere. But I think this matter should not be discussed in Sino-Japanese negotiations, or stipulated in treaties. The reason is that hiring and administration are our country's sovereign rights and cannot be subject to any constraints. And our country now has quite a few talents, so we should always use them first, and only seek them from foreign countries when it is absolutely necessary. We must never abandon domestic talents and employ the unemployed or incompetent people of other countries. We should also pay attention to this point.

From the above, we can know that Sino-Japanese economic cooperation can only be discussed under appropriate conditions, and that when discussing it, we must pay attention to our rights before it can be carried out without harm. I think this is a necessary condition for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, so I especially remind the government and the people to pay attention. Finally, I have a few more words to say. That is: „äÄ I think that the biggest obstacle between China and Japan, and the biggest danger in the Far East, is really the interference of the Japanese military in politics and its continental policy. Before this big premise is changed, all genuine cooperation or partnership between China and Japan is out of the question. Therefore, we should not have any optimistic thoughts about this Japanese proposal for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, so as not to fall into the habit of following the old ways and seeking temporary peace. „äÅ Our country's government has been working hard on national defense and economic construction in recent years, and capital is needed everywhere. This is something that the people should deeply sympathize with and support. But in economic construction, it is better to implement self-reliance in a steady manner than to take the risk of implementing economic cooperation. So do not drink poison to quench your thirst because of temporary needs. „äÇ Although our country's foreign policy has been relatively strengthened in recent years, due to the fact that local areas cannot cooperate with the central government, things that damage power and insult the country are still unavoidable. I remember that in the winter of last year, while the central government was taking an unyielding attitude towards Japan, a local authority was making similar private transactions with a certain country, which was an extremely heartbreaking thing. In the future, I think that the central government and local authorities should cooperate sincerely and help each other in order to be consistent externally. This is also a very important thing.

### Ambassador Xu Leaves Japan and Returns to China Yesterday

Overseas Chinese in Yokohama and Kobe Hold Grand Farewell Receptions

(Nanjing) Our Ambassador to Japan, Xu Shiying, departed from Tokyo at 1:40 p.m. today to return to China. Those who came to the station to see him off included the representatives of the three: Japanese Prime Minister Hayashi Senjuro, Foreign Minister Sato Naotake, and Finance Minister Yuki Toyotaro, former Foreign Minister Arita Hachiro, former Ambassador to China Ariyoshi Akira, former Minister to China Yoshizawa Kenkichi and Obata Torikichi, famous figures from the political, financial, army, navy, and various circles, diplomatic personnel from various countries, representatives of local overseas Chinese organizations, and all students from overseas Chinese schools, totaling more than 400 people. After Ambassador Xu arrived in Yokohama at 2:05 p.m., he attended a grand farewell reception held by the local overseas Chinese, delivered a farewell speech, and personally visited the Yokohama Consulate General. Because Prime Minister Hayashi and Foreign Minister Sato had to attend a banquet, they sent Yoshizawa and Obata, accompanied by secretaries, to the pier to represent them in seeing him off. A large crowd of overseas Chinese gathered at the pier to respectfully send him off. Ambassador Xu boarded the Canadian Empress Liner at 8:00 p.m. to return to China, and is scheduled to arrive in Kobe at noon. He will attend a farewell banquet held by the overseas Chinese in Osaka and Kobe. Important Japanese business leaders in Osaka and Kobe have already made preparations to welcome him. At that time, Ambassador Xu will deliver a heartfelt speech. The Canadian Empress is scheduled to set sail from Kobe for Shanghai on the evening of the 7th. Accompanying Ambassador Xu on the same ship back to China are Secretaries Huang Bodu and Hu Mai of our Embassy in Japan, as well as five other personnel. (Central News Agency, Telegram, 6th)

(Nanjing) Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying has requested leave to return to China to attend Duan Qirui's state funeral. Xu departed by ship from Kobe on the 6th and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 9th. Those returning with him include Secretary Huang Bodu and staff member Hu Shenshu. After arriving in Shanghai, Xu will rest for a while and then attend a welcome reception held by Shanghai charitable organizations before going to Nanjing to meet with President Chiang and Minister Wang to report on the situation at the embassy.

### Japanese Budget Bill Passed by Budget Committee

(Nanjing) The House of Representatives Budget Committee of Japan held a meeting this afternoon and passed the budget bill. However, an article was attached stating that the government should take effective measures to curb the sharp rise in prices. It is now certain that the budget bill will be passed by the House of Representatives on the 8th and then submitted to the House of Peers for deliberation. (Central News Agency, 6th)

(Tokyo) The two secretaries-general, Nagai and Ando, met in the Speaker's office on the afternoon of the 6th. As a result of discussions on a joint resolution by the two parties regarding the budget bill for the next fiscal year, they reached a consensus and will consult with the organs of both parties to formally decide on it in a meeting of representatives.

Supplementary Resolution: 1. It is a violation of the Constitution to include in the budget amounts that have been decided not to be used within the fiscal year. Even if it is decided not to be used, it is also inappropriate to include amounts for suspended use. Although the 23 million yen each in the army and navy expenses belong to the latter, such a precedent should not be set even for temporary changes. The government must pay serious attention to this point when compiling the budget in the future. 2. In order to seek a balance in the national burden, the government should fundamentally reform the central and local tax systems, establish a system for transferring local finances, and submit proposals to the next session of the Diet. 3. In order to ensure the appropriate allocation of temporary local financial subsidies, the government should organize an authoritative committee composed of both government officials and the public. 4. Recently, there have been frequent cases of prosecutors, judicial officials, and police officers violating the spirit of laws and ordinances and trampling on human rights. The government should quickly establish appropriate measures to eradicate these malpractices and eliminate public unease. (Daimeng News Agency, 6th)

### Japanese Lawmakers Seek to Restore Credibility

Plan to Establish New Agency to Study Concrete National Policies

(Tokyo) In light of the current situation, both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives are planning to establish a national policy research agency to restore the credibility of the Diet and political parties and to give full play to their functions. This plan has now begun. The Speaker of the House of Representatives has appointed Okada, Saito, Kiyose, and Uehara as committee members to form a subcommittee to study concrete measures. (Daimeng News Agency, 6th)

(Tokyo) The House of Representatives convened a subcommittee in the Speaker's reception room from 10:00 AM on the 6th to discuss the establishment of a national policy deliberation agency. It was decided to establish a new House of Representatives Research Committee and a House of Representatives Research Bureau. The meeting adjourned at noon. The House of Representatives Research Committee will be selected from among the Diet members, numbering 80, and divided into four divisions. Roughly, the first division will be responsible for the Cabinet, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of Education; the second division will be responsible for the Ministry of Finance; the third division will be responsible for the Ministry of the Army, the Ministry of the Navy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs; and the fourth division will be responsible for the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Railways. It is planned to allocate them in this way, as decided by the subcommittee. The draft can be seconded at the general meeting on the 8th and coordinated with the House of Peers to form various proposals, and then negotiations will be conducted with the government on the necessary expenses and supplementary budget. The outline of the research committee is as follows:

1. A research committee shall be established to investigate and study various situations. 2. A research committee shall be established to investigate and study the circumstances in the preceding paragraph. 3. The investigations and studies in the preceding paragraph shall be conducted upon the order of the Speaker. 4. The number of research committee members shall not exceed 80. 5. The classification of investigations shall be determined by the Speaker. 6. Each division of the committee shall convene twice a month, and extraordinary meetings shall be convened when necessary. 7. The results of the investigations shall be reported to the Speaker.

The outline of the official system of the House of Representatives Research Bureau is roughly as follows: 1. A House of Representatives Research Bureau shall be established to conduct various investigations and studies in accordance with the orders of the Speaker. 2. The Research Bureau shall have the following staff: one Director, four full-time secretaries, and eight full-time clerks. 3. The Director shall be appointed by imperial order and shall be filled by the Secretary-General of the House of Representatives. (Daimeng News Agency, 6th)

### Yesterday's House of Representatives General Meeting

Director-General of the Legislative Bureau Disrupts Official Discipline, Civil Affairs Councillor Questions Harshly

(Tokyo) The House of Representatives General Meeting continued. At 2:35 PM, the agenda was immediately changed, and the government submitted the Karafuto Municipal System Bill. Minister of Finance Yuki explained the reasons for the proposal, and after entrusting it to nine committee members, it was sent to the House of Peers.

The government also submitted a revised bill to the Pension Law and two other items, which were discussed together. After Director-General Kawagoe of the Legislative Bureau explained the contents of the proposal, questions began.

Takada Unpei (Civil Affairs) asked: When the Hayashi Cabinet was formed, the Prime Minister should state his views on the fact that the former Director-General of the Legislative Bureau disrupted official discipline. When the Hayashi Cabinet was formed, the Vice-Minister of the Ministry of Finance, Kawagoe, who is currently the Director-General of the Legislative Bureau, entered and exited the cabinet formation headquarters to handle affairs. This fact is an impolite act on the part of officials. What are the feelings of a Prime Minister with a strong sense of responsibility regarding such a disruption of official discipline? At this point, applause erupted from the Civil Affairs Party seats. Takada then asked questions about the submitted Pension Law: Does the government intend to limit the qualifications for pensions, and does it intend to increase the salaries of lower-ranking officials?

Prime Minister Hayashi replied:

I deeply admire the questions, but the special circumstances at the time should also be taken into consideration. When I received the imperial order, I consulted with Mr. Kawagoe, who was my only confidant in the official world, and I did not consider it a disruption of official discipline.

### US Navy Budget 520 Million Yuan

Accelerating Ship Building Program, House Approves Transfer to Senate

(Washington) The House of Representatives today passed the naval appropriations bill by a vote of 257 to 83 without amendment. The bill has now been sent to the Senate. According to the bill, the naval expenditure for the next fiscal year will be 526,000,000 yuan, a reduction of approximately 56,000,000 yuan from the original budget estimate. The largest item reduced was shipbuilding costs, from 157,000,000 yuan to 130,000,000 yuan, because some expenses will not be used when the current fiscal year ends on June 30. The approved construction program includes 297 aircraft, of which 251 are replacements for old aircraft, as well as one airship, eight destroyers, four submarines, two battleships, three aircraft carriers, eleven cruisers, forty-eight destroyers, and sixteen submarines. Uncompleted projects will continue. (Central News Agency, 5th, Reuters)

### Locarno Question

German Reply Still Pending, No Changes to Ambassador to Britain

(London) According to well-informed sources, Britain previously sent another note to the governments of France, Belgium, Germany, and Italy regarding the new Locarno Pact, raising several questions for them to answer, including the question of Belgian neutrality. Subsequently, the governments of France and Belgium have already submitted replies, but Germany and Italy have not yet replied. It is expected that when the German Ambassador to Britain, Ribbentrop, returns to Britain after reporting to his country, he will bring the German government's reply and deliver it to Foreign Secretary Eden. Therefore, political leaders from Britain and Belgium may hold talks to discuss the neutral status of Belgium. If this neutral status is possible, it should be stipulated within the framework of the Western European Security Agreement (i.e., the New Locarno Pact). At that time, Eden and Belgian Prime Minister Jil√°n will meet in London or the Belgian capital, and King Leopold of Belgium may also come to London under the pretext of attending a golf tournament. (Central News Agency, 6th, Havas)

(London) The Mendusde Guidance Newspaper recently reported that the rumors that German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop will be dismissed and replaced by the German Minister to Austria, Papen, are not entirely credible. In general, Ribbentrop will not be dismissed before the coronation ceremony of King George VI of Britain in May of this year. "Whether there will be any changes in British foreign policy will not be clear until then." (Central News Agency, 6th, Havas)

### British and American Praise for French Financial Policy

Rich in Liberalism, Continued Monetary Cooperation Among Three Countries

(London) Since the French government's decision to adopt a liberal financial policy, the British side, whether it is personnel from the Ministry of Finance, or personnel from the financial and monetary circles, has unanimously expressed their approval. They believe that this move will enable Britain, the United States, and France to continue their monetary cooperation. In addition, the Research Committee on the Redistribution of World Raw Materials of the League of Nations will hold a meeting in Geneva on the 8th of this month. The British government has sent its chief economic advisor, Sir Leeds Ross (i.e., the person who previously went to China for inspection), to attend. Leeds Ross has set off today and will make a brief stop in Paris on Saturday the 6th to have lunch with French Finance Minister Olivol to express to the French government that Britain is very pleased with France's financial decisions. (Central News Agency, 5th, Havas)

(Washington) Financial circles are satisfied with the various resolutions adopted by the French Council of Ministers today regarding the financial situation, and they are particularly pleased with France's adherence to the Anglo-French-American Monetary Agreement. Various sources predict that after France restores free trade in gold, it will definitely allow gold to flow back into the country. The United States is currently suffering from an overabundance of gold, and this situation can be changed thereafter. (Central News Agency, 5th, Havas)

### All Factions in France Support the Government

Prime Minister Asks People to Subscribe to National Defense Bonds

(Paris) After the Council of Ministers adopted important resolutions on finance and economics today, people from all factions, including the opposition parties, expressed their approval. Prime Minister Bloom is scheduled to broadcast a letter to the nation tomorrow, asking the people to subscribe to national defense bonds. President Lebrun, Deputy Prime Minister Daladier, Speaker of the House of Representatives Herriot, Speaker of the Senate Janan, and Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee Gaillot are scheduled to deliver speeches in various local areas on the 7th of this month, urging the people to cooperate with the government. Schmid (Radical Socialist Party), the rapporteur of the House of Representatives budget bill, declared, "I believe that the various decisions adopted by the government are beneficial to the status of the franc and the cause of financial recovery in our country." Bruna (Socialist Party), the deputy rapporteur of the budget bill, also said, "I am convinced that after the national defense bonds are issued, they will be quickly sold out, thus alleviating the financial difficulties of the national treasury. On the other hand, economic recovery and the upcoming Paris International Exposition will also increase the revenue of the national treasury." The chairmen of the Radical Socialist Party caucuses in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, Reni√© and Gambin-Creek, also expressed their approval. The leader of the centrist faction, former Prime Minister Flandin, supports the government's decision, but believes that the government should follow it up with political action, and said that if the Secretary-General of the Communist Party, Dor√©, and the Secretary-General of the General Confederation of Labor, Shih Wu, both support the government's policies, then the people will be able to completely dispel their doubts. In addition, the right-wing Congressman, Xia Bu, the former Director of the Paris Police Department, believes that the measures adopted by the government are appropriate, but another right-wing Congressman, Denai, has a slightly different view, saying, "The current government can be compared to an architect whose building has a very solid foundation on one half, while the other half is built on sand." In addition, the right-wing Congressman Lerno declared that the entire nation should subscribe to national defense bonds. "The government has now adopted the principle of a balanced budget and abandoned the main reason for controlling foreign exchange and adopted a liberal policy, which is what we should be happy about."

### British and French Newspapers Highly Praise

(London) After the French Council of Ministers made a decision on financial issues yesterday, all the newspapers here commented on it, saying that the gold that has flowed out of the country will definitely flow back in, and that the national defense bonds that the government should issue will also achieve satisfactory results. The Qin Wu Shi Bao reported that "Prime Minister Bloom and his colleagues all know that the credibility of capitalists, especially that of small capitalists, must be maintained. Now that the country's exchange equalization fund and domestic bond market are managed by newly established committees, and the members are highly respected, their success can be expected." The Daily Telegraph reported, "This method is both wise and practical, and the people's trust will definitely be restored as a result." The Daily Express reported, "Prime Minister Bloom has saved the crisis of the franc." The Daily People's Voice reported, "From now on, gold can be freely traded in the French market. Prime Minister Bloom's move is not only wise, but also courageous." The Financial Qin Wu Shi Bao reported, "The national defense bonds that the French government should issue are an indivisible part of the entire plan, and will definitely be helpful in solving financial difficulties. If Prime Minister Bloom and Finance Minister Olivol do not give up halfway, and do their best to maintain the franc and bring its price to a proper standard, then their actions yesterday will be of extremely great significance." (Central News Agency, 6th, Havas)

(Paris) The various decisions adopted by the Council of Ministers yesterday on financial matters are rich in liberalism, and all newspapers have unanimously praised them. The Socialist Party's "People's Newspaper" reported, "The government is now using all means to complete its experimental work in the new stage. This method can at least enable the government to do its best, but not to go too far. If this is not effective, then we can only promote other, more severe systems. In short, the government's various major decisions are still experimental in nature." The Communist Party's "Humanity Newspaper" reported, "The reactionaries and fascists should not be too happy too soon. These people seem to want to engage in destruction for the national defense bonds that the government should issue, which is no different from destroying the country. If these conspiracies become a reality, then a financial plan of a democratic nature will be quickly established, and the permanent source of funds for the national budget will not be worried about being depleted." The Aixi You Bao reported, "The three members of the Equalization Fund Management Committee appointed by the government will definitely gain the people's trust. We are convinced that they will definitely establish sound finances." The New Century Newspaper reported, "At a time when partisanship is prevalent and newspapers have prejudices, the government is striving for the nation and unity." The Republican Newspaper reported that national defense bonds should be issued soon, and the people should subscribe enthusiastically and not allow for any avoidance. The right-wing Figaro Newspaper reported, "You have already changed your financial direction, will you also change your political direction? Can you clench your left hand and face each other, and extend your right hand to join hands with others?" (Central News Agency, 6th, Havas)

### US and Philippine Presidents Meet at White House

Did Not Mention Philippine Political Status, Ambassador Shi Visits Quezon

(Washington) When asked by reporters whether President Roosevelt had discussed the political status of the Philippine Islands with Philippine President Quezon, Roosevelt said that he had not mentioned it so far. It is unknown whether it will be discussed in the future, because he has only met with Quezon twice, and both times were at banquets, so naturally he could not talk about political issues. (Guomin News Agency, 5th)

(Washington) Chinese Ambassador to the United States Shi Zhaoji visited Philippine President Quezon today to express his respects. (Guomin News Agency, 5th)

(Washington) Assistant Secretary of State Saywell told the Associated Press reporter today that there are no restrictions on the scope of negotiations between Philippine President Quezon and the Philippine Problem Committee. The first meeting will be held next Monday. Philippine Representative to the United States Barrett hosted a banquet today to treat President Quezon and invited the ambassadors of Britain, Germany, China, and Japan, as well as Secretary of War Hutlin and other important officials to attend. Quezon then went to New York and plans to return to Washington on Sunday. Philippine economic expert Fleming also hosted a banquet today to treat Quezon and Manila mining tycoon Masman, and those invited to attend were Mendelhall, Director of the US Geological Survey, Melton, Director of the Brookings Economic Institute, and Konafo, representative of the American Mining Association. They discussed the future of the mining industry in the Philippine Islands. According to Masman, the golden age of gold in the Philippine Islands has passed, and the current situation is very bland. Gray, representative of the American Agricultural Association, also said today that the association does not oppose the United States and the Philippines concluding a reciprocal trade agreement in principle, but does not advocate making special concessions to the island. When negotiating the trade agreement, the term of autonomy in the Philippines should also be reduced to five years so that negotiations can be conducted in the position of two independent countries. Gray also said that agricultural groups oppose giving the Philippine Islands priority treatment that exceeds other countries. Unless there are special measures in the future, the Philippines should fulfill the Independence Act. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)

### Italian Fascist Party Supreme Council Approves Financial and Economic Report

And Decides Not to Levy New Taxes, National Bank's Gold Reserves Decrease

(Rome) The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party held its third meeting at the Venice Palace last night (it will close after holding the fourth meeting). It listened to Finance Minister River's report on finance and economics and immediately approved it, and decided not to levy new taxes. If the funds required by the national treasury are insufficient, it will still be supplemented by the 5% compulsory bonds issued in October last year. (This bond was issued after the lira devaluation last year and was forcibly subscribed by property owners at 5% of the property value. (Central News Agency, 6th, Havas).

(Rome) After the Fascist Supreme Council met to discuss Italy's financial and economic status, the authorities announced that the gold reserves of the Bank of Italy amounted to 4,021,000,000 lira on February 20. The gold and foreign exchange society's managed foreign currencies and securities are not included in this figure. On February 20, the bank issued a total of 15,677,000,000 lira in banknotes, of which approximately 1,500,000,000 lira were shipped to East Africa. The proceeds from the recently issued 5% bonds and the ordinary income of the Ministry of Finance are sufficient to cover the national expenses for 1937-38, without the need for other special fund-raising measures. According to the last published general index of gold reserves in October 1935, there were 3,936,000,000 lira. Although the value of the current gold reserves is 84,000,000 lira higher than the last report, the amount of gold stored has decreased since 1935. The reason for the increased value is that the lira was devalued by 40% in October last year. (Central News Agency, 6th, Reuters)

### US Decides to Close Embassy in Abyssinia

Cannot Be Seen As Recognizing Italy's Annexation of Abyssinia, Rome Denies Slaughtering Abyssinian Natives

(Washington) The State Department announced today its decision to close the US embassy in Addis Ababa on March 31, but this move cannot be seen as de facto recognition of Italy's occupation of Abyssinia. The only reason is that US commercial interests in Abyssinia are very small and there is no need to establish an embassy. US Ambassador to Abyssinia Enggett will lower the flag and return home immediately, while US Consul Hughes will return home later. (Guomin News Agency, 5th)

(Rome) The Italian authorities today denied reports that Italian soldiers fired on the crowd and completely shot all the Abyssinians around when the Italian Governor-General of Addis Ababa, Graziani, was assassinated last time. They also claimed that there are imaginative records of the events of that day in both Asia and Africa, and that the Italian army used bombs and artillery fire to sweep the crowd, killing 6,000 men, women, and children, which are all unfounded rumors. (Central News Agency, 6th, Reuters)

### Mussolini Practices Sky Bombing

Obtains Pilot's License

(Rome) Mussolini recently obtained an army pilot's license and practiced bombing near Lake Belarasiano north of Rome for two hours today. He dropped bombs from a bomber on a predetermined target. Although the wind was quite strong, the result was satisfactory. (Guomin News Agency, 5th)

### Spanish Surveillance Plan

Failed to Implement As Scheduled

(London) The Spanish coastal surveillance plan was originally scheduled to begin at midnight today, but because Portugal opposed Soviet warships exercising surveillance rights in its seaports, the entire plan could not be implemented and an alternative compromise must be sought. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)

(London) The subcommittee of the Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War Adjustment Committee met at 3:00 PM today and ended at 8:25 PM. According to well-informed sources, significant difficulties have arisen in today's meeting regarding the land border surveillance measures at the border between France and Spain in the Pyrenees Mountains area, and the implementation of surveillance in Portuguese ports. The reason is that the French representative requested that if the non-intervention agreement is broken in the future, the land border surveillance measures in the Pyrenees Mountains area should be cancelled immediately. The Portuguese representative opposed the implementation of surveillance in Portuguese ports because he did not want Soviet ships to anchor in Portuguese ports. Since these two issues are difficult to resolve, most national representatives are deeply concerned that the surveillance plan will not be able to be implemented starting on March 6, as originally scheduled. However, the subcommittee is now scheduled to meet again tomorrow, and the governments of the countries concerned may be able to generally accept the surveillance plan. As for the plenary meeting of the Adjustment Committee, it will only be held after the countries concerned have reached a compromise on all major points. (Central News Agency, 5th, Havas)

### Large-Scale Military Exercise to Be Held by Japanese Army in Tianjin

On the Anniversary of Japan's Victory Over Imperial Russia, Over Three Thousand Troops Will Conduct Exercises Along the Beining Railway Line

Tianjin Dispatch, March 10: To commemorate the anniversary of Japan's victory over Imperial Russia in the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese garrison in North China will hold a large-scale celebration on this day. Two weeks ago, the military headquarters appointed staff officers Tsukada, Senda, Asai, attached officer Suzuki, senior adjutant Kawada, and others to coordinate with the chair of the veterans association, Tamura; the head of the civil defense corps, Shirakawa; and leaders of the anti-national defense women's association and youth volunteer corps to prepare for the ceremony. The Army Mutual Aid Society in the Meiji-dori Hishilai Hotel in the Japanese concession was designated as the preparation office. Preparations have largely been completed in recent days, awaiting the arrival of the 10th to proceed with the events. The day's program includes a shrine visit, a military parade, fireworks, a reception for foreign guests, and a joint large-scale exercise involving infantry, artillery, and cavalry. In an unprecedented move, six aircraft from the Hui Tong Aviation Company will join the exercise in formation. Hui Tong Aviation Company, nominally a Sino-Japanese joint venture in civil aviation, initially declared this intention to alleviate concerns about potential military applications. However, only months later, despite these assurances, the company's aircraft are participating in this large-scale exercise, clearly revealing its deceptive nature. The ceremony will be held in front of the new barracks in Li Mingzhuang, Tianjin, with the hangar of Hui Tong Aviation Company serving as the picnic area for foreign guests attending the parade. The troops participating in the review and large-scale exercise will be centered around the troops of the Second Infantry Regiment under the command of Kayashima, along with soldiers from various branches, totaling over three thousand. The exercise area will extend from Haixia, Xianshuigu, Junliangcheng, and Heiniucheng to Langfang and Beicang along the Pingjin section of the Beining Railway, from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM. All Japanese youth groups, volunteer corps, veterans, and national defense women's associations will participate. Simultaneously, Japanese troops stationed in Fengtai, Tongzhou, and Beiping will conduct similar celebrations and exercises, led by brigade commander Kawabe. A large detachment of Japanese troops stationed in Shanhaiguan began arriving in Tianjin and Beiping on the 3rd of this month to participate in these activities.

Regarding the Japanese army's purchase of land in Taiwan to construct barracks and an airfield, negotiations had stalled due to opposition from our side. However, the funds for the land purchase were allocated by the Japanese Ministry of the Army last month. This matter was submitted by the North China Japanese Garrison for approval, reporting that the land had been surveyed and the price had been determined. Now, facing rejection from our side, the Japanese commander, Tashiro, feels unable to explain the situation to his superiors. Therefore, he continues to contemplate and scheme to acquire land through various means. On March 3rd, Wang Lengzhai, the commissioner of Wanping, visited Song Zheyuan and Qin Dechun in Tianjin to report that the Japanese army recently purchased land from unscrupulous civilians near Fengtai, who impersonated landowners and sold land belonging to other owners under false pretenses. Contract signings and payments were all conducted at the Japanese garrison headquarters in Fengtai. However, as the purchased land amounts to over 1,500 acres, it has not yet been fully acquired. The Wanping Commissioner's Office secretly dispatched detectives to monitor and prohibit the illegal activities of these unscrupulous civilians, hindering the Japanese land acquisition plan. As a result, the Japanese side lodged a protest with Wang on the 3rd, accusing the Wanping commissioner of dispatching line officers to surround the residences of Japanese and Korean residents, obstructing their freedom. They threatened to deploy additional troops to protect the residents from improper infringement if the officers were not immediately withdrawn. The tone of the protest was extremely intimidating. Wang did not dare to promise anything without authorization and requested instructions from Zhu and Qin. Qin stayed in Tianjin for an extra day on the 4th to discuss countermeasures. Song also postponed his return to Beiping for two or three days due to this incident. (4th)

### The Truth Behind the Sensational Head Case in Bengbu Revealed

Painter Used Skullcap Ash to Treat Syphilis; Police Arrested Five Involved in the Case for Interrogation

Bengbu Dispatch: A few days ago, a headless corpse was unexpectedly discovered by a street cleaner from the police station in a trash can at the entrance of a primary school on Huadai Street in Bengbu. The skin and flesh had fallen off, the skullcap was missing, and there was a large hole in the brain. The incident caused a sensation in the neighborhood, with residents expressing astonishment and speculating that it was a case of murder and disposal. The truth remained unclear. The street cleaner immediately notified the police on duty, who reported it to the local court's prosecutor's office, which dispatched personnel to examine the scene. The head was then placed in a wooden box and buried. This occurred on the 2nd of this month. After the incident, the police station paid close attention, believing that this "puzzle" needed to be solved quickly to dispel public doubts. The detective team was ordered to conduct a thorough investigation to solve the case. After investigating in various directions, detective chief Zihua Peng and others learned last night (the 4th) that the incident was related to individuals from the Fang Yongshunxiang Furniture Store on Damalu Street. It was revealed that a man named L√º Baochun from Huaiyuan, who lived on Huadai Street and worked as a painter, was addicted to prostitution and contracted syphilis. He had been seeking treatment for a long time without success, causing him great pain. An old woman named Hu Wangshi, 56 years old, originally from Kaifeng and residing at No. 82 Guohuo Road, ran a tea stove business with her husband, Hu Yonghe. One day, the woman went to L√º's place to collect a debt and learned that L√º was suffering from syphilis. She then told him a secret remedy, claiming that burning the skullcap of a human head into ash and taking it could cure venereal diseases. L√º believed her deeply and hired Jiang Xianyi, a painter from Liu'an, Zhu Guangming (also known as Song Chengming), from Su County, and Zhang Xing, an apprentice from Hefei, all in their early twenties, from the Fang Yongshunxiang Furniture Store to find a head for him. Four days ago, in the early morning, they went to a chaotic tomb near the Dawang Temple outside the third district and dug up a human head. They wrapped it in paper, took it back to L√º, and followed the instructions to crush the skullcap, burn it into bone ash, and drink it with water. The skull was discarded in the trash can, where it was discovered by the street cleaner, leading to the bizarre incident. After the detectives learned the truth, they arrested the five involved parties ‚Äì L√º Baochun, Hu Wangshi, Jiang Xianyi, Song Guangming, and Zhang Xing ‚Äì at 4:00 AM today (the 5th), detained them at the station, and interrogated them by the judicial section. The individuals confessed to the above details without denying anything. The sensational and bizarre case that had shaken the city was thus completely solved, and the truth was revealed.

During the recent general re-investigation of opium addicts, Gu Dai, a wealthy resident of Beitang Street, and accountant Song Gengsheng were reported. On February 21st, Gu Dai and Song went to the county hospital, requesting to be examined. During the examination period, Song was accompanied by a female servant from the hospital, Ai Jin, to the private residence of Dr. Cai Baojun at the hospital for negotiations, which has become widely known throughout the city. On February 3rd, the hospital sent Gu and Song to the county for disposition. As County Magistrate Xu had gone to the provincial capital to attend a meeting, the case was heard by Zhang Bailu, the section chief of the fourth section.

### Two Cars Collide in Changshu, Causing an Accident

Cheng Jianxin, the owner of the Jianxin Fire Brigade in Changshu, recently renovated his new building. On the morning of the 5th, he drove his private car with his friend Xu Renzhi to Suzhou to invite Shen Bao'an, a renowned feng shui master, to inspect the site. They returned to Changshu together at around 4:00 PM in the afternoon. However, when they reached Weijingtang, about twenty kilometers away from Changshu, and were crossing Bridge No. 24, the car collided with a Shanghai Concession car with license plate number 10155 (Municipal No. 1803) that was approaching the bridge. Unable to avoid the collision, Cheng's car was knocked into the river. Cheng Jianxin, Xu Renzhi, Shen Bao'an, and Shen's servant, Cun Shiming, all fell into the river. Fortunately, they were rescued. Cheng and Xu were unharmed, while Shen and his servant were injured. After negotiating the issue of responsibility, it was learned that the car crossing the bridge was owned by a Westerner at No. 12, Bund, Shanghai. The two Westerners and a translator, Wang Zunshi, presented a business card and left their Shanghai address. Cheng and the others then hired another car to return to Changshu and sent the injured to Jishan Hospital. They will go to Shanghai to contact the Westerner at the address and negotiate compensation. Cheng's car is still in the river pond.

The workers were satisfied and agreed to resume work. Therefore, starting from the morning of the 6th, all departments resumed normal work, and the incident came to an end.

### Ancient Artifacts Discovered in Huangshan, Zhenjiang

Liu Hongzhi, a farmer from Zhenjiang, discovered several ancient bronze and porcelain artifacts while digging a mulberry ditch in Huangshan a few days ago. He brought them into the city to sell them, but they were confiscated by the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau and reported to the Department of Civil Affairs, which instructed them to be handed over to the Zhenjiang Provincial Library for safekeeping. The items include a bronze incense burner, a bronze spoon, two porcelain vases, a porcelain jar, a porcelain bowl, and nine pieces of broken porcelain. They were handed over to the library a few days ago. The Provincial Public Security Bureau had antique dealers appraise them and determined that they were Song Dynasty artifacts. According to a researcher at the library, the porcelain is ancient in its craftsmanship, with a white and yellowish-black glaze, similar to Ru ware, dating back at least five hundred years. Among the unearthed items, the bronze incense burner is the most precious and unique. Its style is similar to the Han Boshan incense burner recorded in the Xiqing Gu Jian. It is undoubtedly a Boshan incense burner, measuring nine inches and one-tenth of an inch in height, nine and a half inches in circumference, and weighing about forty taels, which matches the recorded description. It is reported that the provincial library, as the items have no inscriptions, does not want to make rash judgments and will present them for scholarly examination after they have been organized.

Children's Special

### Seeking Knowledge

‚Äî Jingguang

Seeking knowledge is a kind of happiness, but it is also a bitter task. Without diligence and hard work, one cannot gain insight. "Mastering it in one month" or "mastering it in one hundred days" is simply impossible.

Knowledge is not personal property, nor is it a decoration. Those who wear doctoral caps should not be proud, and those who are rejected outside the school gate should not be sad.

Knowledge can be acquired anytime, anywhere. Experience is the most valuable knowledge.

The purpose of seeking knowledge should be to serve society. If one seeks knowledge for personal wealth, then all the knowledge of one's life is entirely false.

Everyone should seek knowledge. If circumstances prevent one from attending school, one can pursue knowledge in many ways.

Seeking knowledge should involve a steadfast and calm attitude, planned research, humble acceptance of others' opinions, and a strong and healthy physique.

Theory and practice should be integrated.

Knowledge progresses with the times, so one must constantly train oneself and revise oneself to avoid falling behind.

### The Boy Who Was King - Peter II

‚Äî Yueqi

Today, there is a very young emperor in the world, Peter II, the King of Yugoslavia. He is only a thirteen-year-old child this year.

Do you think that being a king as a child must be very comfortable and free? No, Peter II's daily life is very regimented, and his mother disciplines him very strictly. He gets up at seven o'clock every day and says his prayers. After having breakfast with his family, he takes his two younger brothers for a short walk. At nine o'clock, he goes to the classroom, where his teachers are waiting for him. He has four subjects, each taught for forty minutes. At 12:45, he has lunch. After lunch, until three o'clock, he has time to rest and study on his own. After that, he has to practice sports, such as riding or other exercises. At 4:30, he has tea. At 7:30, he has dinner, always with his family. At this point, he finishes his regular daily life, and then he spends time with his mother, chatting and laughing. He goes to bed very early, no later than nine o'clock. Peter II loves outdoor activities, so, except on rainy days, his lessons are taught outdoors in the sunshine.

His mother, Queen Marie, gives him only a few dinars - the name of the Yugoslav currency - each week as pocket money to encourage him to develop frugal habits. Peter II feels that it is not enough and often complains to his playmates. He says to his mother, "This can't go on. My money is not enough. I want to do business to make money."

"Very well, my son," his mother replied.

So, in a side room of the palace, a royal carpentry shop was opened, and a highly skilled carpenter was invited to be the king's teacher. When Peter II first met his new teacher, he said bluntly, "Sir, I want you to teach me how to make beautiful things, because the market is bad, and beautiful things may be easier to sell." Needless to say, the goods made by the king himself do not have to worry about sales, and they are all sold at high prices.

What makes Peter II most happy is when he and his two younger brothers went to Milochu last summer - this is a seaside resort in Yugoslavia - to escape the summer heat. In the parks full of birds and flowers, on the beaches with the setting sun, Peter II was accompanied by a group of equally lively local children every day, chasing after each other, playing games, exercising, or chatting.

At present, this thirteen-year-old boy king has not yet exercised his power, but he is already very concerned about state affairs. He knows that his father - Alexander - died to fight for territorial integrity, and he is determined to fulfill his legacy and treat it as a precious inheritance.

### Circulation

‚Äî Zhen

At around seven o'clock on a Sunday morning, Min-er was getting up, and he unconsciously touched his chest, discovering that something was beating on the left side of his chest. After thinking carefully, oh, it turned out that the heart was located on the left side of his chest, and it must be the heart beating. Yes, the heart beats.

"Brother, do you know why the heart keeps beating? What is the function of beating like this?"

"The heart is made of striated muscle, which has a unique property of contracting and expanding. You should know that the human heart is divided into four chambers, the two on top are called atria, and the two below are called ventricles. As the heart contracts and expands, the atria and ventricles also take turns contracting and expanding, which enables blood to circulate throughout the entire body."

"What is circulation? Why do we need circulation?"

"Circulation is the continuous flow of blood throughout the body. But there are two types of circulation. One is called systemic circulation, because it circulates throughout the entire body, so it is also called body circulation. The process of circulation is as follows: the left ventricle contracts, sending the blood inside to the aorta (arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to all parts of the body). After passing through many arteries, it flows into the capillaries throughout the body. After exchanging nutrients, it becomes venous blood again. After passing through many veins (veins are blood vessels that return blood from all parts of the body to the heart), it finally flows from the vena cava into the right atrium. This is one complete cycle, called systemic circulation. There is also a type called pulmonary circulation, because it flows to the lungs, so it is also called lung circulation. The process of its circulation is as follows: the right atrium contracts, and the blood goes to the right ventricle. The right ventricle then contracts, sending the blood into the pulmonary artery, but the blood at this time is venous blood, not arterial blood, which you should note. Flowing into the capillaries of the lungs, it absorbs fresh air, and the blood becomes clean again, becoming arterial blood. After passing through the pulmonary vein, it flows into the left atrium. This pulmonary circulation is like a bleaching operation. This circulatory function is the transportation mechanism within the human body. The heart is the headquarters of this mechanism, and the nutrients, oxygen, and waste that are transported must all pass through the heart. Blood must go through both systemic and pulmonary circulation to complete one cycle. The time it takes is very fast, only twenty-three seconds."

"So our pulse is also flowing. What is the reason for this?"

"The walls of arteries are very thick and also very elastic, so when the heart sends blood into the arteries with strong pressure, the arteries can only temporarily expand a little, and then immediately return to their original shape. This movement is called a pulse. It comes with the beating of the heart, so the timing of its beating and the heart's beating are the same, that is, the number of times it beats in a minute is also the same."

### Righteousness (7)

‚Äî Qing

Maclin very much wanted to swim over with his last partner, but upon reflection, it was simply an unnecessary risk, so he suppressed this momentary impulse. He cheered and waved his jacket towards Meldler. His eyes were fixed on the surface of the water, watching Meldler gradually swim back. Once, he seemed to see a large fin of a shark, and he quickly reached into the water, splashing and making noise, trying to scare it away so that it would not chase after Melderler, while holding on to full hope and earnestly focusing his eyes on him. Meldler mustered all his spirit, almost every nerve completely tense, swimming forward desperately, slapping the water vigorously to prevent the shark from getting close to him, and raising his voice to shout frantically towards the ship in front, but there was not even a single figure on the deck. He swam about two-thirds of the way, and his strength was gone. He planned to give up the last glimmer of hope and simply lie stiffly on the surface of the water, waiting for the sharks to eat him, which would be the easiest thing to do. Who knew that their lives were not meant to end, and a head suddenly popped out on the deck. Meldler was overjoyed and hurriedly raised his arms, struggling and jumping in the water, and was clearly seen by the people on the ship. The ship was a square-rigged brig, which immediately stopped and lowered a lifeboat to rescue Meldler. He could still speak at this time, pointing to Maclin's location.

The square-rigged brig belonged to Americans. The people on board listened to the story told by Meldler and Maclin, and at first they did not quite believe it, thinking that they were escaped pirates, but later they finally took them ashore at Hwai, where a warship happened to arrive and took them to Wangjiapu.

The two men were tried by court-martial, and the entire course of events was fully disclosed under the personal interrogation of the Secretary of the Navy, Sir Heishti. At that time, Meldler was unwilling to speak of his own righteous deeds, so his young partner Maclin spoke in detail, and tears fell like rain on both sides, embracing each other in the courtroom. None of the officials in the court were not deeply moved by them. The Admiralty followed the instructions of First Mate Smith's will and immediately promoted Meldler. He later died in 1848, but the great name of the small sailing ship "Magpie" will forever remain in the history of navigation. The fearless courage of the people on board and the righteousness of sacrificing themselves to save others are of permanent commemorative value. (The End)

### No Need to Pray to Guanyin

‚Äî Seeking Truth

Better Spiritual Medicine Than Willow Sprigs

Superstitious legends say that the Guanyin Bodhisattva holds a bottle of sweet dew in one hand and a willow branch in the other. For those with eye diseases or blindness, if Guanyin Bodhisattva dips the willow branch in the dew and sprinkles it on the patient's eyes, the eye disease will be cured, and blindness will regain sight.

Does the Bodhisattva's dew really have such efficacy? Can those suffering from eye diseases be cured by praying to Guanyin? No, this is just "pure fabrication." In fact, a spiritual medicine has now been discovered that can cure all kinds of eye diseases. This is "Ming Ming Eye Drops" (produced by Wuzhou Pharmacy). This is because this eye drop is carefully researched by chemical experts, extracting elements from domestic Coptis chinensis and Ephedra, supplemented with zinc and boric acid and other ingredients. For symptoms such as swollen eyelids, red eyeballs, itching and stinging pain, photophobia and tearing, etc., the effect is immediately visible upon instillation, and it can be completely cured in a short time. Moreover, the bottle design is novel and extremely convenient to use. Such a spiritual medicine is truly better than willow branches. Eye disease sufferers only need to spend thirty cents to regain their sight and do not need to pray to the Bodhisattva.

### Riotous Spectators Disrupt Donghua vs. Laboriel Match Yesterday at Shen Garden Before Game's End

Beating Referees and Demolishing Netting, Ultimately Demanding Ticket Refunds - Laboriel Led 4-1 with Ten Minutes Remaining - Unlawful Actions Merely Cause Foreigners to Laugh

Donghua and Laboriel met again yesterday at Shen Garden in the Western League Group A match. In the previous match at the Municipal Stadium, Donghua had won 4-0. However, times have changed; Donghua is not as strong as before, while Laboriel has become increasingly prominent and is now the only major enemy of the French Business team. Therefore, the outcome of the battle was not difficult to predict. When Laboriel was leading 4-1, a few unruly individuals in the general seating area recklessly created disturbances, demolished the netting, and rushed into the field. They behaved indecently towards the linesman Liu Xiren and the referee, causing great chaos and arousing the public anger of foreign spectators. Dozens of British soldiers wanted to join the resistance, but the crowd was discouraged. British officers ordered the soldiers not to intervene, and they all left. The crowd then became even more rampant and, without cause, surrounded the Xie Jin Association and demanded ticket refunds. The referee was escorted off the field by players from both teams. The match was disrupted and terminated with more than ten minutes remaining. This situation chills those who organize sports competitions. The slave-like behavior of ignorant people, who immediately shrink and soften at the sight of foreign soldiers, is even more infuriating. This kind of unlawful behavior only reveals inferiority and causes foreigners to laugh. The irresponsible on-site police, who retreated in the face of difficulty, arrived late after the association staff had requested additional police by phone to suppress the situation, which violated the purpose of protecting local safety.

Match Summary

Yesterday's match was halted not because of direct conflict between players and the referee, but entirely due to spectator misconduct. Therefore, whether the result is valid or whether a rematch is needed depends on the decision of the Western League Committee. The course of events is briefly described as follows:

A Draw to Start

At the beginning of the match, Laboriel was playing with only ten players. Donghua looked promising. Dai Linjing had two good opportunities but missed them, hitting a wild shot and the goalpost, respectively, which was a pity. Later, Laboriel's attacks became more frequent. Zhang Rongcai made many important saves. After fifteen minutes, Laboriel's right-winger Tuile kicked a corner kick. After several rotations, center-back La'aiti got the ball, looked for an opening, and shot, succeeding in one go. Laboriel's left-winger Wotuo'er arrived late to complete the team. Jia Youliang was repeatedly offside. A certain Western linesman repeatedly raised the flag to remind the referee, and the spectators gradually showed dissatisfaction with him. Sun Jingshun had a good shot but missed slightly. Dai Linjing received a pass from Wan Xianghua, brought it in front of the goal, and scored, making it 1-1, ending the first half.

Three Goals Conceded in a Row

About ten minutes into the second half, Ding Zhaowei and Wotuo'er were fighting for the ball. Ding was inadvertently slapped in the face. Ding thought the other party did it intentionally and sought revenge, but was penalized. As a result of this penalty, Donghua was scored against again by Clayton. A great uproar arose in the general seating area, foreshadowing the subsequent misconduct. Five minutes later, Jia Youliang was again offside and penalized by the linesman. Laboriel seized the opportunity to attack again, and Clayton scored another goal. Soon after, the ball was kicked into the general seating area. The spectators insisted on not returning it, and the match was suspended for three to five minutes. At this time, the atmosphere in the stadium was very noisy. When the game resumed with a new ball, a few spectators tried to destroy the wire mesh and enter the field, intending to commit misconduct. At the same time, Donghua conceded another goal, still scored by Clayton, making it 4-1.

Orderly Chaos

A small number of spectators in short shirts, with great momentum, jumped into the field. The police on the side of the field acted as if they didn't see anything, letting them do as they pleased. The referee initially tried to stop them, but the crowd responded with fists. The situation descended into chaos, and the game came to a halt. Seeing the bad situation, both sides immediately protected the referee and linesmen as they left the field. British soldiers in the one-yuan seating area were greatly displeased and joined in the suppression. Someone (a clerk from a local product company) was hit in the corner of the eye, which was red and swollen, as a consequence of their own actions. After the British soldiers ordered them to leave, the crowd vented their anger on the Xie Jin Association, eventually dispersing after getting ticket refunds. Over seven hundred forty tickets were refunded, a true injustice.

### Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Prepares for 7th National Games Shanghai Preliminary

### International Basketball Preliminary: China Loses to the United States

Score: 34-44 - Russia Defeats Japan 34-18

China and the United States played their first international basketball game of the year last night at Shen Garden. China was contained by the opponent's two tall players and lost 34-44. The performances of both sides were extremely wonderful, and all eight hundred spectators were satisfied. The United States' victory was well-deserved, and China's defeat was not to be criticized. In the first half, China trailed by eight points, with the score at 22-14. Locke and Carson of the United States, and Cai Yanxiong of China, were the most praised players in yesterday's game. In the Group B match between Russia and Japan, the skills of both sides were very rudimentary, and basic training seemed lacking, let alone offensive and defensive tactics. The score was 18-11 in the first half, and the final result was 34-18, with Russia winning. The championship is expected to be firmly in Russia's hands.

In terms of strength, the United States is indeed above China. However, this year's Chinese team has an average talent level and is good in both offense and defense, so there is a chance to win. In yesterday's game, China was too cautious in the first half, calling for four timeouts, which prevented them from playing freely in the second half, creating psychological constraints. Initially using Zhou Dayun as center did not seem as effective as using Kuang Yao Ya. In terms of technique, Zhou is not as good as Kuang. Although Zhou is taller than Kuang, he is ultimately not as good as Rhein. The opinions of the directors Shi Jun and managers Kunnan are sought to confirm this. The results of yesterday's game are as follows:

United States: Position, Field Goals, Free Throws, Fouls, Points
Locke: Forward, 5, 4, 0
Kangden: Forward, 0, 2, 3
Rhein: Center, 4, 1, 3
Apaidaga: Guard, 0, 2, 4
Fostou: Guard, 1, 0, 1
Carson: Guard, 6, 3, 2
Total: 16, 12, 13
(First Half) US 22 points, China 14 points
(Second Half) US 22 points, China 20 points
Referee: Zhang Guozhu Inspector: Hebner

China: Position, Field Goals, Free Throws, Fouls, Points
Feng Nianhua: Forward, 1, 2, 3, 4
Han Zhenyuan: Forward, 0, 1, 0, 1
Yin Guiren: Forward, 2, 1, 1, 5
Zhou Dayun: Center, 1, 0, 2, 2
Kuang Lizhi: Center, 3, 0, 1, 6
Cai Yanxiong: Guard, 5, 0, 4, 14
Chen Zongqi: Guard, 1, 1, 1, 3
Wang Nanzhen: Guard, 1, 1, 1, 3
Weng Renan: Guard, 0, 0, 0, 0
Total: 14, 6, 10, 54

Opponent's Aggression

After the Russia-Japan game ended, the China-US game began. China started with Feng Nianhua, Yin Guiren, Zhou Dayun, Cai Yanxiong, and Wang Nanzhen. In the first three minutes, both sides missed scoring opportunities. Feng Nianhua suddenly got the ball near the basket and scored, opening the record. Cadi Xuan immediately returned the favor. Rhein followed, making it 5-2. China called a timeout. The United States' momentum was strong, and they gradually took the lead. Locke also scored, and Rhein and Cadi each made contributions. China only added three points from Yin Guiren and Zhou Dayun, making it 10-5. China called another timeout.

Eight Points Behind

From then on, China suddenly rallied. Cai Yanxiong and Yin Guiren each scored, making it 9-10, only one point behind. However, good times do not last long. Carson made a diagonal shot, which fortunately went in. Taking advantage of the center jump ball, Carson rushed to the basket and scored another two points, prompting China to call a third timeout. Cai Yanxiong first tried a hundred-step piercing shot and hit the mark, then intercepted the ball under the basket, rushed straight to the opponent's basket, and scored another goal without any resistance, making it 13-14, only one point behind. It seemed that it would not be difficult to break through the barrier and stand out. Unexpectedly, Locke threw a backward shot under the basket and scored two goals in a row. Carson followed. China only added one point from Feng Nianhua, making it 14-21. China then called a fourth timeout. Apaidaga made a free throw, making it 22-14, ending the first half.

Stalemate Situation

At the start of the second half, China changed its lineup, using the all-Jinan Five Tigers team of Han, Yin, Deng, Cai, and Wang, abandoning the steady style of the first half. Cai Yanxiong scored first, boosting their morale. However, after a short period of contention, the United States team used their tall players to surround the basket, attacking from both sides and scoring seven points in a row. Cai and Yin worked hard to score, making it 20-29. After Apaidaga was ejected for committing four fouls, the Chinese generals Han and Wang added two more points. Locke and Rhein again displayed their skills, making it 33-22. China called a fifth timeout and was penalized with a free throw, which Locke scored, and the substitute Fostou, eager to make a name for himself, immediately scored a goal, making it 36-22. Cai Yanxiong of China also committed four fouls and was ejected, leading to another major adjustment in the lineup.

Final Struggle

After that, China played with Feng, Han, Kuang, and Weng Renan, and Chen Zongqi. For a time, their vigor increased greatly, adding nine points, and the competition was extremely rapid. The opponent found it difficult to defend and to implement cooperative offensive strategies. However, after 31-38, Wang Nanzhen and Zhou Dayun re-entered the field, replacing Weng Renan and Han Zhenyuan. At that time, there were still eight minutes remaining. China launched an active attack. The audience gave enthusiastic support, and the atmosphere was very tense. After 34-41, Carson scored twice, making it 34-44, ending the game.

### Hong Kong Special Silver Shield Semi-Final: South China Advances to Final

Eliminates Westerners 3-2

This newspaper, Hong Kong, 6th - In the special silver shield semi-final on the 6th, South China, led by Li Huitang, sent all its athletes to the field. Westerners' main player, Dagao Shannu, was absent, greatly weakening their strength. In the first half, Westerners scored a penalty kick first. South China tried their best to counterattack, and He Jiaqiang scored, leveling the score. In the second half, Feng Jingxiang scored first, but soon Westerners scored a goal. Near the end of the match, Huitang scored a goal, resulting in a 3-2 victory for South China, securing their place in the final. Also, in the Ordinary Cup, Hong Kong Club won 3-2 against the Navy team, and St. Joseph's won 2-1 against the Western Police Club.

### Jinan Loses to Western Concession Police

1-8

Yesterday, there were four matches in the Shanghai League A soccer competition. As a result, Jinan was no match for the Western Concession Police, losing by a large margin of 8-1. The first half was closer, with the Western Concession Police only winning by two goals. In another match, the French Business team played against Portugal. Because the Portuguese team had an international match today, they rested their key players and only used Group B players to cope with the match, so the strength was vastly different. As a result, the French Business team won the first half by eight goals and added two more in the second half, concluding with a large victory of 15-0. Lux's victory over Western Business was also a significant score of 9-2. The current situation of Group A is as follows. However, the match between Donghua and Laboriel was deemed invalid and is not included.

Yesterday's Results

French Business def. Portugal (Group A) 15-0
Lux def. Western Business (Group A) 9-2
Laboriel vs. Donghua (Group A) Match Suspended
Western Concession Police def. Jinan (Group A) 8-1

### Issues Regarding the Middle School Graduation Joint Examination (3)

‚Äî Ying

Some commentators have also stated that the greatest drawback of the joint examination is that it hinders the health of young people. It has been confirmed that students' weight generally decreases after the joint examination, and there have even been cases of suicide due to failing the joint examination. This statement seems plausible but is not actually true, and should be carefully examined. To the best of the writer's knowledge, there have been no reports of measuring the weight of middle school students before and after the joint examination. Only the Nanjing Health Education Committee conducted weight measurements of children participating in the primary school joint examination in the second semester of the 22nd year. The entire file of this case was destroyed in last year's fire at the Social Affairs Bureau, making it difficult to investigate thoroughly. What is currently known is that the committee, recognizing that various primary schools were increasing the quantity and quality of student coursework to improve the rate of participation in the joint examination, measured the weight of children from schools such as Yixian Bridge Primary School, the Primary School Department of the Central University Experimental School, and the Nanjing Middle School Experimental School before the joint examination. A total of 816 people were measured. Subsequently, measurements were taken again after the joint examination, with 658 people being measured. As a result, the weight of 223 people decreased, accounting for 33% of the 658 people. However, the weight of 89 people also increased, accounting for 13%. The remaining 346 people, accounting for 54%, did not experience much change in weight. The average weight loss was 0.745 kilograms, approximately three-quarters of a kilogram. This result cannot be ignored. However, from a rigorous scientific standpoint, this record is somewhat inadequate. ‚ë† Only over 600 people were measured. ‚ë° The time interval between the two measurements and the joint examination is unclear. Was the pre-examination measurement taken before or after the increase in coursework? ‚ë¢ During the period between the two measurements, were there other factors besides the joint examination that could have affected weight changes, such as climate, diet, sleep, and illness? Were these factors meticulously recorded? ‚ë£ What were the individual scores of those whose weight increased, decreased, and remained unchanged on the joint examination? What is the correlation between weight loss and joint examination scores? There are many other similar questions. Before these questions are satisfactorily answered, it is not permissible to dogmatically argue that the joint examination sufficiently reduces weight. Even if precise measurements of the weight of middle school students before and after the joint examination prove that weight is indeed reduced, we must still conduct similar weight measurements for half-term examinations, semester examinations, and the weight before and after school graduation examinations. If the results show that weight is not reduced during regular examinations, slightly reduced during semester examinations, further reduced during school graduation examinations, and most reduced during the graduation joint examination, then not only the graduation joint examination but also the formats of semester examinations and school graduation examinations must be improved. If all examinations seriously conducted by schools never reduce weight, but the graduation joint examination does, then we should not hesitate to abolish the joint examination immediately. Without such a conclusion, it is definitely not factual. If all examinations, whether school examinations or joint examinations, sufficiently reduce weight, then the issue is whether to have examinations or not, not whether to have a joint examination or not. To evaluate various aspects of the joint examination system, precise measurements and explorations of weight and other health issues should be conducted meticulously to maximize benefits and minimize harm. As for those who commit suicide due to the joint examination, it is truly the most unfortunate. We must strive to reduce the difficulty and stress of the joint examination for young people so that tragic events never happen again. Modern social life is becoming increasingly complex and economically driven. Relations between the sexes often drive young people to desperation, and the pressure of academic work and carelessness in learning can also lead to great sacrifices. If physical and mental overwork leads to various illnesses, or even death due to military training or accidents during swimming, it is not unheard of. The key is to continuously improve to prevent such occurrences from happening.

### Agricultural Loan Syndicate Increases Loan to Hebei

Set at One Million; Begins in Early April; Other Provinces Still Follow Original Plan

### China Construction Bank Held Annual Shareholders' Meeting Yesterday

Re-elected Directors and Supervisors; Reported on Business Operations; Last Year's Profit Over 1.91 Million Yuan

According to Xinxin News Agency, the China Construction Bank held its third annual shareholders' meeting at the Hong Kong Road Bankers' Association Club yesterday afternoon at 3 PM. More than 70 shareholders including Kong Xiangxi, Song Ziwen, Bei Songsun, Song Ziliang, Zhu Zian, Zhang Gongquan, Xu Xinliu, Li Fukun, Tang Shoumin, Chen Jian'an, Qian Xinzhi, Ye Fuxiao, Zhang Fangni, Song Hanzhang, Xi Demao, Wang Boyuan, Qu Jigang, Wu Qiding, Zhang Peishen, and Wu Yunzhai attended. Kong Xiangxi chaired the meeting and re-elected the directors and supervisors. General Manager Song Zian reported on the business operations for 1936, with a total profit of 1,914,531.62 yuan. The details are recorded as follows:

Business Report

General Manager Song Zian reported on the business operations for 1936, stating: "Since its establishment, the company's business has continued to develop actively in accordance with the original policy, in order to promote various important construction projects in the country and achieve economic recovery. A summary is given below: ‚ë† Promoting Railway Construction: Assisting the government in promoting and building important railways across the country is one of the important businesses in the company's original policy. Therefore, at the beginning of its establishment, it focused on the completion of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. Over the past two years, after several twists and turns, an agreement was finally signed in May this year with the Sino-British Bank to complete the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway 6% Gold Pound Loan of 1.1 million pounds. Furthermore, the construction of the Qiantang River Bridge is the main task to complete the road. Therefore, before the loan agreement was reached, the company first raised construction funds in advance in order to complete the project as soon as possible. The company is aware that Sichuan Province is rich in resources and urgently needs development, and the need for transportation is the most pressing. The authorities in Sichuan Province also entrusted the company with this matter. Therefore, it invited a French banking group to send representatives to China to jointly plan investment and road construction methods with the Ministry of Railways and the Sichuan Provincial Government. After a long period of consideration and consultation, it was finally successful, creating the privately-run Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company to first build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which is 523 kilometers long and requires about 56 million yuan in national currency. Part of the cash and all the materials will be provided by the French banking group in the form of long-term credit. The company is also the representative of the French banking group, which is the first example of foreign investment in our country. In particular, all matters concerning construction, operation, management, personnel, and material procurement are under the control of the Chinese, which eliminates the disadvantages of previous foreign loans for road construction being bound by regulations. It is expected to be completed in two and a half years. After the road is open to traffic, it will greatly contribute to the development of Sichuan and Guizhou's resources and the regulation of people's livelihoods, and will surely yield considerable results. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is the hub of transportation in southeastern China and has a profound relationship with the development of industry and commerce. This autumn, the company lent US$100,000 to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Company at its request to help complete the road as soon as possible. ‚ë° Supporting Transportation and Electrical Businesses: This spring, the Ministry of Communications, in order to reorganize and develop various transportation businesses across the country, consulted with the company to raise funds of 5 million yuan in national currency so that various facilities could be carried out in order. In addition, the capital telephone is of great importance to improving the efficiency of government agencies. Therefore, the company also raised funds for the Ministry of Communications to expand the capital telephone plan and helped it succeed. Wuhu's privately-run Mingyuan Electrical Company borrowed 150,000 yuan in national currency from a joint banking group organized by Qianyi Enterprise Bank and China Industrial Bank in 1934. In October of this year, the banking group repeatedly requested that the loan be transferred to the company. The company, upholding the principle of supporting privately-run electrical businesses, also transferred and accepted the entire loan. ‚ë¢ Constructing Public Utilities: The Jiangxi Provincial Government previously consulted with the company to borrow purchase methods for the construction of the Nanchang Hydropower Plant. After repeated consultations between the company and foreign merchants, a credit purchase loan of 104,000 pounds was established and construction started in the autumn. It will be completed in a short period of time. ‚ë£ Underwriting Public and Private Bonds: For the purpose of business development, Shanghai Yong'an Company, in accordance with the company bond methods of European and American countries, consolidated its fragmented short-term debts, issued company bonds of 5 million yuan in national currency, and consulted with the company to underwrite them. The company believes that the circulation of company bonds in the market is a common occurrence in European and American countries, while in our country, it still needs to be promoted. Therefore, the company was happy to assist and agreed to underwrite them. Within a short period of time, all of them were sold out and registered on the Securities Exchange, officially opening trading and circulating in the market. The Qingdao Municipal Government, in order to expand the source of tap water, increase water pipes, complete the first wharf, and other wharf and harbor facilities, promote compulsory education, manage rural construction, and enrich museums, submitted a request to the National Government for approval to issue the first phase of construction bonds of 3 million yuan in national currency on November 1 this year, and consulted with the company to underwrite them. Because the company was concerned with construction, it agreed to assist and obtained the cooperation of the financial community, which actively invested and fully subscribed.

Re-election of Directors and Supervisors: The company has 25 directors with a term of three years, and nine supervisors with a term of one year. All of them have now reached the end of their terms. Therefore, they were re-elected at yesterday's shareholders' meeting in accordance with the regulations. As for the list of elected directors and supervisors, it was not announced due to the calculation of shares and equity. It will be announced on Monday. It is also understood that the company's net profit for 1936 was a total of 1,914,531.62 yuan.

### Public Concession Tram Workers Initiate Full Strike Yesterday

Party and Government Organs Issue Proclamation to Maintain Transportation; Tram Workers Agree to Resume Work This Morning

The Dagong News Agency reports that, following the strike of all workers in the mechanical department of the British-owned Shanghai Tram Company in the Public Concession, mediation was attempted by representatives from the Party and government organs. However, due to the firm stances of both sides, no resolution was reached. Yesterday morning, all the workers from the mechanical department set out separately, preventing drivers and ticket sellers from starting their routes and blocking trams from leaving the depot, bringing tram services to a halt. Upon receiving reports, the Party and government organs, recognizing the importance of trams to public transportation, jointly issued a proclamation, ordering an immediate resumption of work and promising to impartially mediate the demanded conditions. The workers expressed their acceptance and agreed to return to work at 6:00 AM this morning as usual, thus enabling all tram routes to resume operation and restore transportation. Details are provided below:

Blocking Tram Services

More than 500 workers from the mechanical departments of the British-owned Tram Company's Old Depot on Hart Road and the two new depots on Boone Road and Baikal Road launched a joint strike following the dismissal of workers by the company and the presentation of seven demands. Representatives from the city's Party and government organs, as well as the General Labor Union, joined in mediating between labor and management. The company officials refused to accept the demands raised by the mechanical department workers, claiming they were unreasonable, only agreeing to pay wages for the two days of the strike. The mechanical department workers, failing to secure their demands, mobilized at around 5:00 AM yesterday, going to Yangshupu, Tilanqiao, and Jing'an Temple Road to block tram drivers, ticket sellers, and other workers from entering the depots, demanding they join the strike, thus preventing them from working.

Suspension of All Routes

Following the obstruction of work by the mechanical department workers on all drivers, ticket sellers, and other workers in the traffic department, all tram routes of the company were suspended. These included: (Route 1) Jing'an Temple to Gongyuan Bazichang (Public Recreation Ground), (Route 2) Jing'an Temple to the 16th Pier, (Route 3) Ma Gen Road to Dongxin Bridge, (Route 4) Xianzhong Road to Tilanqiao, (Route 5) The French Concession tram route originally from Old West Gate to North Railway Station, but now, due to the strike of trams in the Public Concession, has been shortened to run from Old West Gate to Dongxin Bridge, (Route 6) Yuan Road, (Route 7) North Railway Station to Tilanqiao, (Route 8) Yangshupu to the 16th Pier, (Route 12) Jing'an Temple to Tilanqiao. The trolleybus routes also suspended were: (Route 10) Minguo Road to North Railway Station, (Route 15) Sanyangjing Bridge to Yuezhou Road, (Route 16) Caojiadu to Minguo Road, (Route 17) Dapu Bridge to Lan Road Kunming Road, (Route 18) Xie Bridge to Yuezhou Road, (Route 19) Minguo Road to Xiaoshadu, (Route 20) Jing'an Temple to Zhaofeng Park, (Route 21) Gordon Road to Pingliang Road.

Joint Proclamation

The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau jointly issued proclamation No. 343 regarding the strike of British tram workers, stating: "Regarding the strike of workers of the British-owned Shanghai Tram Company in the Public Concession due to labor-management disputes, which has suddenly disrupted traffic and affected public safety, it is deemed highly inappropriate. Therefore, we urgently issue this joint proclamation, ordering all workers of the company to strictly comply and immediately resume work. The conditions for improved treatment proposed should be calmly awaited for review by the Party and government organs before further processing. No delay or violation is permitted, lest severe investigation ensues. This proclamation is issued with the utmost importance." Dated March 6th, 26th year of the Republic of China. Standing Committee members Tao Baichuan, Pan Gongzhan, Tong Xingbai; Bureau Chief Pan Gongzhan.

Negotiations in Progress

After the Party and government organs jointly issued a proclamation ordering all workers to resume work immediately, the Shanghai Tram Company specially dispatched Hu Ziyu, a Chinese compradore, to the Municipal Party Department to discuss a solution. He was received by Lu Jingshi, a committee member of the Party Department, who replied to the company representative that the Party and government organs would be responsible for resolving the worker strike problem, ordering an immediate resumption of work. As for the workers' demands for improved treatment, these would be subject to mediation by personnel dispatched by the Party and government organs after the workers resumed work, but the company could not refuse under any pretext. Mr. Hu expressed acceptance and promised to convene a board meeting in the shortest possible time to discuss the workers' demands and provide a satisfactory response.

Earnest Persuasion

In order to expedite a resolution to the labor unrest, the Party and government organs, following the company's expression of cooperation, had Municipal Party Committee member Lu Jingshi, Investigation Section staffer Yu Yaoqiu, Civil Movement Section staffer Lu Yinchu, and General Labor Union member Gong Yuting convene over a hundred worker representatives from the company's mechanical, ticketing, and driving departments to earnestly explain the advantages and disadvantages and pledge that the Party and government organs would be responsible for addressing the conditions. The workers were told that mediation would begin after they resumed work, and they would be free to act if the company showed no sincerity in negotiations. The worker representatives expressed their acceptance of the guidance provided by the Party and government organs and agreed to communicate the message to all workers.

Resumption of Work This Morning

The worker representatives of each department, after accepting the advice of the Municipal Party and government organs and the General Labor Union, returned to the workers' assembly point and announced the outcome to the public. All workers, in compliance with the orders of the Party and government organs, have decided to return to the depot at 6:00 AM this morning. (The mechanical department, however, will resume work tomorrow morning due to Sunday holiday.) All tram routes will be restored to normal operation.

### Jade Art Exhibition Opens to the Public Yesterday

Jade Artifacts on Display Changed Daily

The jade art pre-exhibition, organized by the association participating in the Paris International Exposition, opened the morning before yesterday and began selling admission tickets yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, opening to the public. Shanghai ladies, considering that the exhibits in this jade art pre-exhibition are the essence of jade artifacts collected nationwide, will soon be shipped to France for exhibition, and are unwilling to miss the opportunity. Therefore, those who went to buy tickets to visit were very enthusiastic. President Sun Ke and President Yu Youren also visited the exhibition at 10:00 AM yesterday morning with their families. They inquired about each precious jade artifact and praised them highly. The association, because the exhibition hall is cramped, has not been able to display all the jade artifacts, and is specifically changing them daily so that lovers will not miss any treasures. It is learned that many jade artifacts will be changed and displayed tomorrow morning, among which a "Jadeite Taizhen Playing with Parrot" is the most precious. According to the device, the hollowed-out design is extremely ingenious, the face and fingers are jade, crystal clear, clean and flawless, and the whole body is emerald green, like wearing a green robe, lifelike. Taizhen holds a peony in her hand, and the two parrots spread their wings and jump, which is very realistic. It is rare and valuable to carve out several characters from one jade and coordinate them appropriately. In addition to the entrance to the exhibition hall, the association sells admission tickets at Yong'an and other four major companies, as well as China Underwear Company, Guanshengyuan, New Asia Hotel, and Shengtaichang Hardware Store on Bair Road in the French Concession.

### Ningbo Liners to Implement Cooperative Anti-Piracy Measures Starting Tomorrow

Set Sailing Times for Shanghai and Ningbo; "PP" as the Alarm Signal

The Shanghai-Ningbo liners currently include ships operated by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, San Bei Steam Navigation Company, Taikoo, and Ning-Shao. Two ships enter and exit every day. This route relies mainly on passengers. Each ship carries one or two thousand people on each round trip, and sometimes four or five thousand. Therefore, each company attaches great importance to navigation safety. Fortunately, it is a short route, and there are few accidents. As for the ocean liners on the northern and southern seas, piracy incidents have been greatly reduced since various shipping companies increased anti-piracy equipment. However, Ningbo liners attach more importance to it. In addition to increasing escort police on each ship, Taikoo, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, San Bei Steam Navigation Company and other shipping companies have agreed on a simple method of cooperative anti-piracy and mutual communication. It was agreed that starting tomorrow (the 8th), all ships, including Xin Jiangtian, Xin Ningyu, and Ning Xing, must implement it. The measures for cooperative anti-piracy stipulate that, for example, the ships departing from Shanghai to Ningbo should send wireless telegraphs to each other once at 10:00 PM and 2:00 AM every day. If the whole ship is safe, the letters "R.H." are used to represent it. Also, the ships returning from Ningbo to Shanghai are required to send telegrams to each other once at 8:00 PM and 12:00 AM every day. If the whole ship is safe and nothing happens, the letters "H.J." are used to represent it. In case of an unexpected danger, the code for an urgent telegram is "P.P." If a ship sends this alarm wireless telegram, the ships receiving the telegram will know that there is a piracy alarm on the ship sending the telegram and should immediately find a way to rescue it and notify the nearby navy and water police to rush to arrest the pirates and rescue the ship. In this way, the Ningbo liners can be permanently safe and passengers will not suffer losses. Yesterday, each shipping company informed the captains and radio operators of each Ningbo liner to implement it tomorrow.

### City Ferry Sinks Boat

Yangjing Creek Current is Very Rapid; Nine People Fall into the Water, Three Rescued

At about 8:00 PM last night, a certain car ferry was sailing through Yangjing Creek, and a boat carrying eight passengers was also rowing from West Shanghai to Pudong at that time. It crossed in front of the ferry, but unexpectedly the current was very rapid and it was impossible to avoid it, causing the boat to be hit amidships by the ferry. All eight passengers on board, and the boatman, fell into the water and floated on the surface of the water. The personnel on the ferry saw that the accident had occurred and stopped the ferry and tried to salvage. As a result, three people were rescued. Two of them did not take in much water, so they went ashore and went home. A man named Sun Husheng lost consciousness due to excessive water intake and was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. The other six people have not been recovered and are feared to have sunk to the bottom of the river. The Pudong River Police Station received the news and immediately sent a boat to assist in the salvage, but there was no progress late into the night.

### Chiang Shih-chieh Estate Lawsuit Settled; Certificate of Management to Be Issued

Parties Expressed Intentions in Court Yesterday; Court Inquired and Adjourned for Review

After the death of Chiang Hsing-chieh, a wealthy merchant from Nanking residing in Shanghai, his wife, Yang, managed his considerable estate and retained lawyer Wang Fu-chang to apply to the First Special District Court for a certificate of management of the estate. The court ordered a public notice in accordance with the law. At this time, Chiang Hsing-chieh's son, Chiang Kuo-pei, suddenly filed a lawsuit against Chiang Yang for division of property, temporarily halting the application for the certificate of management of the estate. The division of property lawsuit continued for years, finally reaching a settlement. Chiang Yang paid Chiang Kuo-pei 17,500 yuan in cash and transferred three plots of land with buildings on North Szechuan Road, Hsing Chia Chiao, and Rue Robert. Chiang Kuo-pei waived all claims to other property and debts and made no further demands. The court recorded the settlement. The court then continued with Chiang Yang's application for the certificate of management of the estate. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Gui Yu convened a hearing in Civil Division 12, summoning Chiang Yang's lawyer, Wang Fu-chang, to clarify the proceedings. The court instructed the immediate issuance of the certificate to complete the formalities. Chiang Kuo-pei also sent a lawyer to court to state that he had no objection to Chiang Yang's application. Judge Gui Yu reviewed the report and ordered the parties to withdraw and await review.

### Unfortunate Hunanese Girl Luo Hsi's Rape Case; Age Verified

He Kangli Concocted a Scheme to Shift Responsibility; Witnesses Verified Luo's Age

Luo Hsi, a seventeen-year-old girl from Hunan, lost her parents at a young age and was raised by the Wei family, hence her other name, Wei Hsueh-chen. Due to inappropriate behavior by her foster father, Luo discontinued her studies and came to Shanghai with her classmate Hsu Tso-min in August of last year

to Study

She first resided at the home of her cousin, Li Chang-o, who introduced Luo to He Kangli (27 years old, a graduate of an art school, and a teacher at a school last year) to learn Mandarin. He lived in Tian Cheng Li, Xue Hua Fang, Rue Voyron, in the French Concession. On October 19th of last year, when Luo went to He's residence to borrow bed boards, she was forcibly raped by He Kangli. This continued several times. He promised to marry Luo, but after several encounters, Luo

became pregnant

She urged He to hold a wedding, but He instead instructed Luo to have an affair with his housemate, Liu Binru, in order to shift responsibility for the future child onto Liu. Unexpectedly, Liu exposed He's secret scheme and invited fellow villagers to a banquet to announce He's secret. At this point, He, enraged, abandoned Luo. Luo, alone in Shanghai, wandered aimlessly and had no choice but to report to the French police and file a complaint with the Second Special District Court, seeking legal redress. He, hearing the news,

fled to Nanking

for several months. Recently, he secretly returned to Shanghai. Luo discovered this and reported it to the French police, who dispatched detectives to arrest He and deliver him to the Second Special District Court. After investigation by the police department, a public prosecution was filed according to law. Judge Liao of the Criminal Division examined the case and ordered a postponement to summon witnesses for further questioning due to a dispute over age. This was reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Liao of the Second Special District Court again came to Criminal Division 1 and ordered the defendant He Kangli

to Be Brought In for Continued Questioning

Witness Wang Hsien-tou, 34 years old, from Hsiangtan, Hunan, residing at 168 Dapoo Road, Rue Pere Robert, opening a hotel business, stated that his younger sister, Wang Liang, attended Cheng Tao Primary School with Luo Hsi in 1931. They were born in the same year, in the same month, with a ten-day difference in their birthdays. My sister is ten days older than Luo, so I know that Luo was sixteen years old last year and not yet of age. Subsequently, Luo Chi, Wu Hsiu-chen, Wang Chun, Li Ping, Chien Chun, and others from Hsin Hua Art School provided testimonies, with wording similar to Wang Hsien-tou. At this point in the hearing, as the facts were clear,

the Order Was Given to Commence Argument

Lawyer Yuan Chia-huang from the police department argued the facts of the case, stating that the defendant raped the complainant on October 19th and then continued several times, and also incited the complainant to commit adultery with others. This point is undisputed by both parties. The only point of contention is the age. The defendant cunningly argued that Luo Hsi was seventeen years old, but he himself admitted that when he took Luo to the hospital to register, he stated that Luo was sixteen years old. The facts

are extremely clear

It is requested that a sentence be imposed in accordance with Article 227 of the Criminal Code, the crime of raping a girl under the age of sixteen. The defendant's defense lawyer argued that although the circumstances of the case are complicated, the facts are very clear: it is a love triangle. Due to the complainant's romantic nature and promiscuity, she committed adultery with the defendant He Kangli and then committed adultery with Liu Binru. Because her feelings for Liu were better than those for He, she filed a complaint to arrest and convict He, in order to achieve their goals. It is requested that the court acquit the defendant. Subsequently, the complainant's lawyer, on

collateral civil suit

argued that the defendant's actions, in terms of humanity and social theory, were truly inhumane. A fifteen- or sixteen-year-old, orphaned and helpless girl was raped by the defendant, leading to the occurrence of this case, thereby completely ruining the complainant's lifelong reputation and causing unspeakable mental anguish. In addition to punishing the defendant for his due crime, it is requested that the defendant be ordered to compensate the complainant for living expenses of 40 yuan per month, for a period of 40 years, totaling 19,200 yuan, plus 1,000 yuan for mental distress and consolation, totaling 20,200 yuan. Judge Liao reviewed the arguments, announced the end of the debate, and set the date for sentencing as March 10th. The defendant was remanded in custody.

### Western Paint Industry Supervisory Committee Sues Le Chen-pao and Others for Account Settlement and Reconciliation

Unable to Provide Factual Basis for Prosecution; Both Parties Seeking Complete Resolution

The entire supervisory committee of the Shanghai Western Paint Industry Association, along with member Wang Tso-lin and others, appointed Ma Shang-chieh as their representative, and retained lawyer Chao Kun to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, accusing Le Chen-pao, Pei Run-sheng, Chang Lan-ping, Le Keng-rong, and others, directors of the Shanghai Foreign Goods Commercial Association, of breach of trust and embezzlement in the management of the association's property. The defendants retained lawyers Li Tsu-yu, Lin Ying-ching, and Wang Man-yun for defense. Judge Chen Shuo-ying held twelve hearings and ordered the defendants to submit all account books for review. The defendants only submitted records from 1919 to the time of the lawsuit, stating that previous records were lost and could not be found. When the court ordered them to be turned over, the defendants refused and appealed to the Third High Court and requested the judge to recuse himself, thus delaying the case for several months. The appeal has now been finalized, and a continued hearing was held yesterday. Both parties were absent from Shanghai due to other matters and were represented by lawyers. The plaintiff's lawyer requested a postponement, and the defendant's side agreed. The judge stated that the previous order required the defendants to submit account books up to 1919, but the previous ones had not yet been submitted. If they claim they cannot be provided, they should provide a factual basis. Subsequently, lawyer Yen Yin-wu, representing the defendants, stated the approximate process of managing the accounts and affairs of the Foreign Goods Commercial Association since its establishment. Le Chen-pao's lawyer argued that Le served as a director in more than twenty organizations and institutions in Shanghai and has never been involved in accounting matters. He has now ordered a thorough search, but the true situation of the accounts before 1927 cannot be found. The court stated that it must wait for the accounts to be sent to the General Chamber of Commerce for verification before it can be clarified. As the parties were absent today, a date will be set for another hearing. It is heard that both parties are in the process of reconciliation outside of court, and the case may be completely resolved soon.

### Han Hsiao-ti's Case of Dual Rape

Two Unmarried Tang Sisters; Defiled While Working and Attempted to Be Sold

Tang Qiao-nu and Tang Qiao-er, daughters of Tang Long-tseng, a resident, are both between seventeen and eighteen years old and unmarried. They both work at the Shen Hsin No. 9 Factory. In May of last year, Qiao-nu became acquainted with Chen Jui-hsiang, a male worker from Yangchow, 21 years old. Qiao-er had an affair with Han Hsiao-ti, a male worker. On February 18th of this year at 5:00 PM, Chen Jui-hsiang and Han Hsiao-ti went to the Shen Hsin No. 9 Factory, falsely claiming to take Tang Qiao-nu and Tang Qiao-er to see a play, and lured Qiao-nu and Qiao-er to a hotel in the Public Concession, where they were raped for four nights. Afterwards, they moved Qiao-nu and Qiao-er to the Carter Hotel in the Public Concession and instructed their friends Yang Teh-shun and Lu Chang-he to guard them on Carter Road, intending to take them to another port and sell them for profit. After Tang Long-tseng found out, he reported to the police, who arrested Chen Jui-hsiang, Yang Teh-shun, and Lu Chang-he and handed them over to the District Court. Prosecutor Kong filed a public prosecution for the crime under Article 241, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code.

After verifying the confessions, the judge announced the end of the debate and set the date for sentencing as the 9th of this month. The three defendants were granted bail.

### Hu Lien-sheng Suspected of Fraudulently Withdrawing Factory Silk

Part of the Stolen Goods Has Been Recovered; Hu Denies Fraudulent Withdrawal

The Shanghai branch of the Shanghai-Hangchow Yi Chi Transportation Company, located at 348 Avenue Edward VII, was recently commissioned by the Hangzhou Kung Yi Silk Store to purchase factory silk from the Yuan Feng Silk Store at 10 Lane 205, Tientsin Road, for a total of 1,500 yuan. At that time, half of the silk was transported to Hangzhou. The remaining 750 yuan worth of silk was to be withdrawn by Yi Chi Company on the afternoon of the 4th of this month at 1:30 PM, with the old bookkeeper Chao Mei-ching being instructed to go to Yuan Feng to withdraw the goods. However, Yuan Feng informed them that an hour earlier, a man had withdrawn the goods with Yi Chi's withdrawal slip. After Chao reported to the company, the report was forwarded to the Old Zhabei Police Station. After investigation by Chinese detective Lang Chin-tang, it was determined that the withdrawal slip submitted to Yuan Feng by the man was not a forgery, and it was definitely an item of Yi Chi. The seal was also not forged, so it was concluded that it must have been done by an internal employee of Yi Chi, or someone familiar with the organization of the company. The company was asked if there were any suspicious people, and the company identified Hu Lien-sheng, a Shanghainese man, 20 years old, resident of 31 Jen An Lane, Kuling Road, as a suspect. Hu previously held a position in the company. In November of last year, he stole a customer's check for 2,960 yuan. Also, on one occasion, when the company ordered him to withdraw goods, he stole part of the goods on the way. Therefore, he was dismissed on December 28th. However, after his dismissal, Hu still frequently went to Yi Chi to borrow money from former colleagues. He came again a few days ago, just as the company staff was contacting Yuan Feng by telephone to arrange the withdrawal of the goods, and the handwriting on the withdrawal slip to Yuan Feng was very similar to Hu's handwriting. Therefore, Hu was indeed suspicious. The detectives carefully monitored Hu's whereabouts, and at 11:20 PM the night before last, Sun Lien-sheng, a former accountant of Yi Chi Company, met Hu in the Da Ching opera troupe at the Tian Yun Lou amusement park. However, upon seeing Sun, Hu ran into the movie theater, hoping to escape. Sun cried for help and arrested him, taking him back to the police station. A photo of a female waitress was found on him. Hu completely denied everything at the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Special District Court Criminal Division 1. Police lawyer Chien Hsun-chiu explained the previous situation. Because the time of the defendant's arrest in this case was late last night, there was not enough time to investigate. For the time being, no public prosecution will be filed. It is only requested that he be temporarily detained, and part of the stolen goods has been recovered by the police station. It should also be taken together with the defendant to the pawnshop to identify whether it was pawned by him. It is requested that the court allow a postponement after questioning, etc. After Sun Lien-sheng and Chang Yung-en, the current accountant of Yi Chi Company, provided their testimony, Hu Lien-sheng was questioned, but he completely denied everything, saying that he was being falsely accused. Judge Chien Hung-yeh reviewed the confessions and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for another week.

### Conspired to Kidnap Two Girls, Claiming to Take Them Back to Hometown to Be Brides

Paid 130 Yuan; Ku Chin-lan Was Missing

Wang Rong-chang, a Shandong native residing at 58 Xin Chi Bang Road, between January 28th and February 4th of this month, colluded with Wang Yu-shan, a native of Chenkiang, Chi Chen, a woman from Changchow, and Chen Wang, a woman from Tanyang, and bought thirteen-year-old Chang Lu-ying (from Kiangpei) and seven-year-old Ku Chin-lan. At approximately 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, he and his wife, Ma, accompanied the two girls at the Whangpoo Wharf in Yangtsepoo, intending to take the Tsingtao steamer back to their hometown to sell them for profit. Huishan Police Detective Wu Teh-kuei and Wang Tung-po saw them and found them suspicious. They were arrested, and Wang Yu-shan, Chi Chen, and Chen Wang were successively arrested and taken to the police station. It was learned that Chang's family lived in a bungalow on Yangzhou Road, and her father's name was Chang Chin-shan. Ku lived at 9 Ti Lan Chiao, Yangshupu, and her mother, Ku Yin, was from Ningpo. The two girls were sent back to their homes. Wang Rong-chang and the other five men and women were detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court Criminal Division 3. Lawyer Chang Tien-yin of the Public Works Department stated that according to Wang Rong-chang's confession at the police station, the older girl, Chang Lu-ying, came from Chi Chen, and he paid 85 yuan to buy her. He paid 45 yuan for the younger girl, Ku Chin-lan, with Chi Chen and Chen Wang acting as intermediaries. He intended to take Chang back to his hometown to marry her to his nephew as a child bride, and Ku to his own son as a wife. Purchase agreements were established. Wang Yu-shan falsely claimed to be Ku's biological father at the time. It is requested that this case be investigated in detail. According to Chang Chin-shan, Lu-ying is my own daughter. Because of poverty, I entrusted a friend named Chin to act as a matchmaker. Chi Chen and others acted as intermediaries, selling her to Wang Rong-chang to be a daughter. This is the truth. According to Ku Chin-lan's mother, Yin, the girl disappeared on the 17th of the twelfth lunar month of last year, while playing at the door, etc. Judge Tai Jung-tuo questioned the defendants, but their confessions were evasive. He ordered them to be remanded in custody separately for further review.

### Special Letter from British Consulate to City Government Regarding Missing Female Passenger on Shengjing Steamer

From Qingdao to Shanghai on the 23rd of Last Month. Member of the World Women's Red Swastika Society.

The Shengjing steamer of British firm Taikoo Yangxing, which sailed from Qingdao to Shanghai on the 23rd of last month, had a middle-aged female passenger go missing on board. The British Consulate General in this city, based on a report from the ship owner, sent a special letter to the City Government reporting everything. The contents of the letter are recorded as follows:

According to the report of the ship owner of the Shengjing steamer of British firm Taikoo Yangxing, on the night of February 23rd to 24th of this year, while the ship was sailing from Qingdao to Shanghai, a Chinese female passenger in second class went missing. This person boarded in Yantai, and her ticket was sold by Yantai Rong Sheng Zhan. On the evening of February 23rd at 10:00 PM, a waiter saw her enter her private cabin. At 8:00 AM the next morning, the waiter went to call her, but she was no longer in the room. A search was started throughout the ship, and inquiries were made to the crew and fellow passengers, but there was no trace of the woman. This matter shows that there was no illegal activity involved. It is suspected that she went to the deck alone at night, causing her to fall or jump into the sea and drown. The passenger's luggage has been sent to this office by the ship owner. Now, the remaining items are sent along with this letter, etc.

The female passenger's name is Lin Yuangong. She is a member of the Andong branch of the World Women's Red Swastika Society and the responsible vice-supervisor of the Andong Women's Moral Society. She resides in Andong County. The remaining items include a fur-collared woolen overcoat, a silk-padded jacket, a pillow, a hand mirror, a hat, a small white cloth bag, and a drawstring wool carry bag, one of each.

Just as the sounds of joy and clinking glasses filled the air, Chen Xiaosizi, a man around thirty years old from Jiangbei who worked as a pimp at a certain foreigner's brothel in Hongkou, arrived with his concubine. After sitting down and drinking a cup of wine, he ate some cold dishes, and suddenly his stomach started hurting unbearably.

### Du Zhisan, Accountant of the Catholic Church on Wutong Street, Petitions for Bankruptcy

Absorbing Deposits from Mostly Women. Official Says Bankruptcy is Dishonorable.

The Catholic Church on Wutong Street, Dongyuanmen, Chenghuang Temple, was the first church opened in China by the Ming Dynasty Chancellor Xu Guangqi. Du Zhisan, the accountant of the church, is currently 85 years old and from Fengxian. He has been at the church since he was 18 years old, for over 60 years. Because he is the accountant of the Catholic Church, a group of female church members deposited more than 190,000 yuan with him. Du Zhisan is very resourceful and owns a lot of property, including over 40 houses in Jingyili, Fumin Street, in the city, 14 houses in Jing'erli, Anping Street, 8 houses in Jing'sanli, Anren Street, all in the bustling area of Xinbeimen, over 20 houses in Yanhaigai Street, and two three-story residential buildings at No. 62 and No. 72 Wutong Lane, both in the bustling area of Laobeimen, and other scattered properties. Du Zhisan has suddenly hired lawyer Wang Zhonghuan to petition the local court for bankruptcy, stating that all his assets are currently estimated to be worth 280,000 yuan, while his external debts, including deposits, are owed to over 100 households, totaling over 400,000 yuan. He claims that due to low land rents, monthly rent income is only over 1,000 yuan, which, after deducting property taxes and water bills, is not enough to distribute interest to depositors. Moreover, those seeking interest payments are constantly coming, making it impossible to cope. Yesterday, Judge Chen Pin held a hearing in the Civil Division. Du Zhisan, because his son is deceased, brought his grandson Du Chengen to court to explain the situation. Li Zhen, Zhang Mingji, Zhang Yazhen, and six other households hired lawyer Xu Wufang to claim that the six creditor households have mortgages and special rights and are not subject to bankruptcy proceedings. Lu Zhushi, also known as Lu Maria, Jin, Ai Ma, Zhang Yiji, and other households hired lawyer Ai Zhenlin, stating that Du Zhisan claims that the property market is depressed, but when Du took the deposits from the women to buy the property, the value at that time was several times cheaper than it is now. Moreover, he is not a real estate merchant, and real estate is immovable. The creditors also presented evidence from the Land Bureau that Du had sold off a lot of his property, indicating that he had secretly converted it into cash. Therefore, the creditors oppose bankruptcy. At that time, there were many creditors sitting in the courtroom, mostly women, numbering no less than several dozen. The judge found that the debts amounted to 400,000 yuan, with 200,000 yuan secured by mortgages and over 190,000 yuan unsecured. The unsecured debts were all deposits. The judge then asked the women, "You each deposited several thousand yuan. Why didn't you deposit it in a bank but wanted to deposit it with a private individual?" The creditors said that it was because he was the accountant of the church, reliable and trustworthy, and the money was borrowed from them. The judge then said to Du, "Bankruptcy is dishonorable." Du replied that he had no choice. At this point, the judge, seeing that there were many creditors in this case, ordered that the hearing be postponed to another date and ordered him to bring the account books to the court for review.

### Daughter Lured Away and Not Returning, Father Files Complaint with the Bureau

Guo Shirong Has Been Detained and Sent to the Bureau for Investigation. Rickshaw Puller Reports to the Police Bureau Regarding Transporting the Girl.

Shen Tingfu, a native of Hubei, lives opposite the Shiba Jian Local Police Station in Pudong. He has a daughter named Muzi, who is fifteen years old and in the bloom of youth. She is petite and charming. Guo Shirong, a man from Tianjin who works in a certain institution, coveted Muzi's beauty and tried to seduce her in every way. Muzi, being young and ignorant, was bewitched by him. They had a relationship last year. Later, her father heard about it and moved the family to Maigen Road, Zhabei, hoping to sever the ties between the two. On the 27th of last month, Guo found out the address of the Shen family and visited again. On the pretext of going to the theater, he lured Muzi out again and secretly stayed with her at the Sanyi Inn near Maigen Road, repeatedly engaging in sexual relations for three nights. On the first of this month, he took her to Pudong and hired Zhou Fuyou, a Tongzhou native and rickshaw puller who lived at No. 45 Xujia Hall, Qichang Zhan, to take her to his house to stay. Shen, seeing that his beloved daughter had not returned for several nights, knew that she had been lured away by Guo. In a fit of urgency, he filed a complaint with the Yangjing Police Station in Pudong the day before yesterday. After the police chief investigated the case, he ordered Guo to be detained and the plaintiff and defendant to be sent to the general bureau for interrogation. Zhou Fuyou, the rickshaw puller, heard that Guo had been detained and sent

All Months Rise by 6-7 Jiao

The spot market opened higher as American cotton continued its frenzied rise, with spot prices rising past 1.40 yuan per picul and Osaka Sanpin cotton rising 1.30 to 2.40 yuan.

### Weak French Franc Leads to Large Purchases of American Cotton

Spot Prices Rise 1.40 Yuan

Yesterday, American cotton opened weaker due to profit-taking by longs and local dealers selling off. There was hope for a second rally as the Western District received rain, but all months initially declined by up to 6 points. Subsequently, peer firms on Wall Street, Liverpool, and the mainland dealers, seeing the widening differential due to the weak French franc, bought heavily, causing prices to rise sharply. 12 March delivery notices have been absorbed. New spot cotton transactions are quiet, but the delivery of old orders is very active. The cloth market rose due to active trading. Hester's estimates this week's factory consumption at 292,000 bales, and Liverpool stocks at 415,000 bales.

### Eight-Four Grey Cloth Market Soars

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market experienced a sharp rise due to the surge in foreign cotton prices. The morning spot yarn market also showed strong upward momentum. Qingdao fine cloth prices rose by 0.10-0.20 yuan, but actual sales remained sluggish. However, fine cloth and fine twill grey cloth surged because Japanese merchants offered to buy over a thousand pieces of fine cloth at 0.05 yuan above the market price, causing the market to jump by 0.025 yuan. Fine twill spot cloth also rose by 0.025 to 0.05 yuan. Spot 84 grey cloth was the most scarce, soaring [missing] (0.20 yuan per [missing]). Dyeing factories and wholesalers in this street absorbed over 500 bales, mostly spot goods and warehouse receipts. In addition, various smaller buyers also purchased 300-400. As spot yarn prices retreated in the afternoon, the market gradually softened. Local factories and Cantonese merchants bought over 300 bales of spot white cloth, fine twill and dyed cloth. The Cantonese merchants' [missing] were often too harsh, reducing the number of transactions. However, their interest had improved slightly. The prices of fancy colored goods were stable. Stocks of dark colored goods were depleted. The prices of light colored printed goods mostly rose, reflecting the spring season. Inventories were gradually accumulating, and sales were slightly easier. Shipments of plain pongee, bleached cloth and blue cloth were more active. The local factories' white goods, especially coarse cloth and coarse twill, were the strongest. Military demand for 16-pound and 14-pound coarse cloth and heavy-weight dyed coarse twill remained strong, with daily sales very brisk. The factory could not keep up with demand and had to ration goods to domestic merchants, leading to very busy business. It is said that over a thousand small packages were shipped out throughout the day.

### Only 20-30 Cars of Wheat Missing; Shorts Cannot Corner the Wheat Market

Highest Price of 6.81 Yuan Cannot Hold; Retreats to 6.73

Yesterday, the wheat futures market retreated. The morning opening saw the near-term market rise again, following the trend of the previous day. Longs naturally took advantage of the situation to take profits. The highest price for the current month reached 6.81 yuan, and April also rose to 6.70 yuan. New wheat from June onwards saw less competition, with only 0.02-0.025 yuan difference. However, at the afternoon opening, the current month's market suddenly softened, falling to a low of 6.71 yuan. According to investigations, shorts were short at least 20-30 cars of wheat, a small amount that was easy to cover. As a result, the situation reversed and the market fell. Trading in other months remained active, and prices hovered. Given this situation, if cargo arrives smoothly, it will be difficult to corner the market for the current month. The spot wheat market saw offers increase by 0.03-0.05 yuan, but trading was light and likely to halt. Kaitiantai Shao offered over 1,000 bags of wheat at 6.66 yuan, then at 6.61 yuan.

### Futures Flour: Bulls and Bears Form Opposition

Yesterday, the flour market in all months saw overseas wheat quotes rise, with Chicago up 0.07-0.08 yuan, Canada up 0.04-0.05 yuan, and Liverpool up 1 pence. When Fu opened prices, overseas wheat prices had rebounded strongly, and the momentum of the previous day also contributed. The opening price for the current month rose by 0.04 yuan, and prices for April and later months also increased by 0.02-0.03 yuan. However, factories had difficulty making new purchases, and real demand and cross-market longs were selling, so the market softened again after opening. At the afternoon opening, due to hedging by another factory and selling by longs, the near-term market continued to weaken, while trading in the far-term months was light and prices hovered. Currently, bulls and bears are in opposition, but real demand is the mainstay of both sides. If sales are insufficient, it will be difficult for the bulls to succeed.

### Passenger Xian [rice] Market Turns from Soft to Stable

Yesterday, passenger Xian [rice] arrivals and sales were even, and the market turned to a stable situation. Although there was a shortage of cabin space and Cantonese merchants were unable to continue bulk purchases, there was some occasional business. Shantou Xia [rice], Northern production, and Northwest passenger [rice] also saw a small amount of trading. The [rice] market in this street had lost its appeal and weakened. The market is turning from soft to stable, but hopes for improvement still depend on smooth Cantonese trading. Over 9,000 bags were offered daily, including 6,230 bags of Jiangxi rice, 570 bags of Xiang rice, 800 bags of Wenxian rice, and 1,500 bags of Jiaxing coarse sheep-tip [rice].

There was 1 hao of thin rice, and since the thickÁ≤≥ market had been fully adjusted, the sales market in this street was active and the market has recovered slightly by several fen to 0.1 yuan. Thin rice sales were sluggish because the [missing] were not satisfied, and only Qingdao and Tianjin merchants purchased over 1,000 bags. The color was only stable. The same was true for Dujian, Yinyuan, and Fan.

### Soybean Oil Cake Rises Steadily

Soybean Sales Not Insignificant

Yesterday, standard soybean oil cake continued to rise, and spot goods continued to be inquired about by local merchants. Although the sales volume was not high, it was steadily moving, and market sentiment had stabilized. Dalian's market has risen continuously. Yesterday's telegram stated that soybean oil cake [missing], but the increase was not as great as the day before. The market was very firm, and Shanghai's floating shorts were wary. Factories and firms lacked large-scale selling, and foreign longs were active again. Therefore, prices rose steadily after the opening. In the afternoon, it was further boosted by the Dalian telegram and market sentiment. The closing price of machine oil rose by approximately 0.1 yuan, standard cake rose by 0.01 yuan, and standard beans rose by 0.08 to 0.06 yuan.

Yesterday's soybean market saw good sales due to the salability of soybean oil cake and a surge in Dalian's market, creating bullish market sentiment.

### Securities

Public Debt Still Being Absorbed by Retail Investors

Market Prices Continue to Rise by 0.1-0.2 Yuan

Yesterday, trading on the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange's public debt market was increasingly sparse. Bulls and bears remained locked in a firm stalemate. Large traders generally adopted a wait-and-see approach and rarely made moves. Trading on the floor relied solely on retail buying and selling to stay afloat. Price fluctuations were quite chaotic, and although market sentiment appeared scattered, it remained in a firm state, so the trend was quite stable. At the morning opening, Grade E and Grade D bonds saw many sellers and appeared weak, but retail buying of Grade B and Grade A bonds was strong, rebounding by 0.05-0.15 yuan.

### Sugar Market

Over 10,000 Bags of Hainan Red [sugar] Continue to Arrive

Yesterday, the Shanghai Sugar Association's benchmark prices saw little change. 24 Coarse White spot was 22.6 yuan, transit at 7.35 yuan. Dongbai No. 4 spot was 22.8 yuan, transit at 7.8 yuan. No. 8 spot was 22.5 yuan, transit at 7.55 yuan. No. 9 spot JRO mark was 22.4 yuan, transit at 7.3 yuan. Local factory spun white Zhenji No. 1 was 21.7 yuan, Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 were subject to rebates. No. 1 ice was 26.5 yuan, No. 2 was 26.4 yuan. Transactions for these types of goods were rare due to low actual sales. Offers were scarce. Over 10,000 bags of Hainan red [sugar] continued to arrive from Qiongzhou and Sichuan via two rounds of shipping, so prices were difficult to raise. However, green pieces, due to their lower price, sold briskly. The market remained stable. Scattered offers of Gaomingjing red [sugar] were priced at 15 yuan. Yesterday, 800+ bags of Quanzhou sugar arrived via the Hua Feng ship, including some green pieces, which were very well-suited to the market.

### Silk and Tea

New Silk Sales Confirmed Yesterday

20 Bales Ordered by American Firms

New silk sales by American firms have been confirmed, with "B" white factory silk priced at 730 yuan, but the lot size was only 20 bales. Other Indian and non-[missing] silks have been quiet recently. User trading was also very weak, and prices were mediocre and unremarkable. Yesterday, 4-5 bales were sold locally.

### Metals

Local Nails and Washers Rise by Another 0.5 Yuan

Spot Black Iron Heads About to Run Out

Yesterday, local factory prices for yuan nails and washers rose again by 0.5 yuan, to 14 yuan per barrel. However, prices offered by dealers in this street remained at 13.4-13.5 yuan. Apart from good retail sales to the local construction and door industries, transactions with other merchant groups and inter-dealer trading remained low. According to those in the trade, the market for the nails and washers has risen too high, and there are still many cheap goods in the hands of hoarders, so it is difficult to raise the actual market price in the short term. Maintaining the market at slightly above 13 yuan would already be considered fortunate. Yesterday, only 300-400 barrels were offered.

The black iron heads market showed an upward trend yesterday, with prices estimated at over 12 yuan per load, but spot goods were about to run out, leading to more purchases. The market looked good.

Talking Points

### Processing and Rushing Production Probably Too Late

‚Äî Meng Ruo

The British psychologist Huxley once said: "If a world other than mankind, such as an invasion from Mars, were to occur, mankind might be able to unite immediately; otherwise, it is not easy to be consistent." Because of this, conflicts often occur among mankind. Look at the current world: it is full of crises, and all countries are devoting their full strength to the arms race. Recently, the British and American governments announced huge naval expenditures. Other countries are also catching up quickly. The tension has reached an extremely serious stage.

Italy, as one of the great powers, is naturally unwilling to fall behind in war preparations. The Fascist Supreme Council recently decided on five national defense plans. All able-bodied men, from the ages of eighteen to fifty-five, must be militarized. At the same time, it is also planned to develop a so-called "child-rearing front" to recruit soldiers in the future. This is also a glimpse of Italy's war mania.

It is frightening to say that countries are now preparing for slaughter, even considering unborn babies. Italy and Germany have recently vigorously encouraged childbirth. People who have many children can receive government rewards. This is in the hope of increasing the country's population to consolidate its national combat power. The plan can be described as very thorough.

However, building ships and cannons can be accelerated, but childbirth cannot. No matter how much the government encourages it, it cannot force single men and women to marry, nor can it make married couples produce. It can be seen that the method of encouragement is very unreliable. For example, in Italy, encouragement is spared no effort. However, as a result, the population birth rate last year has decreased from 2.9% in 1922 to 2.2%.

Even if childbirth can be processed and rushed, it will be too late. To drive a born child to the battlefield, you must wait at least twenty years, or ten years. However, the world's war is imminent, and it can be triggered at any moment. Today cannot guarantee tomorrow, and this year cannot guarantee next year. Then, no matter how many times the "child-rearing front" develops, the new forces of twenty years later cannot save the current crisis.

As for twenty years later, the world at that time will be very different from today. Perhaps mankind has united, and peace has been achieved. The power of the ambitious has collapsed and has no place to stand. It can be seen that even rushing to make cannon fodder is in vain. However, since Italy has decided to implement the encouragement of childbirth, it is the suffering of a part of the people. Those who have not married must pay a single tax, and those who have married but have no children cannot have equal employment. This is indeed depriving people of their freedom and is extremely harsh. But at the same time, there are some benefits. Some single men are not afraid of not being able to afford a wife. As long as they get married and work hard, they can have one child a year, catching up with three children in two years, and the government will pay for your living expenses. The worry is that processing and rushing production will not yield results. But this is your own bad luck, and you can't blame others.

### Village Stage Play

‚Äî Zhi Fu

It is the season of green mountains and clear waters. Along the Guojia Dian area, peach blossoms by the river are budding, and willows are drooping. Groups of village children spend their days in the fields, behaving as if crazy, teasing, playing, chasing, and whiling away their golden childhood. It's the same every year. On March 16th, the performance of a village stage play at the Five Kings Temple„äÄ made it even livelier and more boisterous. In the hearts of the children, it added a layer of intense joy compared to previous years!

Ah Hai and Little Tomcat, two mischievous children, hopped and skipped towards the battleground, singing:

"Cherry blossoms are blooming (A)!

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Sister's face is pretty!

Sister's face is pretty (O),

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Brother wants it!"

"Hehe!" Ah Hai stopped in his tracks and chuckled. Looking back, Pretty Sister Qiao Er, walking behind them, was blushing bright red.

Pretty Sister Qiao Er was even more charmingly dressed! A green silk jacket, a black vest, and a thin braid combed impeccably, with a pink ribbon as bright and fresh as the peach blossoms, fluttering in a straight line in the warm spring breeze. This time, she really couldn't suppress her shyness and scolded in a delicate voice:

"Little bastards!"

Along with the scolding, a burst of laughter rippled back and forth, and a rosy blush climbed onto her cheeks. She quickened her pace, lowered her head, and walked on...

"Rush forward!"

Little Tomcat shouted loudly, overjoyed and unable to contain himself, taking off after her. Unexpectedly, the young beauty threw a handful of sand at him, and the grit landed in the wild child's eye sockets. He felt uncomfortable... and wanted to cry.

"A real man doesn't cry, haha!"

A large group of men clamored.

The men were gathered from all the surrounding villages. They wanted to enjoy that day of revelry. They had put down their farm tools, forgotten the hardships ahead, forgotten everything... Now everyone stretched their faces with excitement, widened their eyes, and stared at Pretty Sister Qiao Er, and at Little Tomcat and the others. Two nearby children were gasping for breath.

The laughter soon subsided. Ah Hai, that little rascal, became silent, rubbing his fingertip on his nose, his eyes like those of a greedy cat, constantly fixed on the shoulders of those selling sugar nests, sugarcane, and cooked food... Saliva often dripped from the corners of his mouth, he couldn't resist! He spat softly:

"Damn it, such fragrant stuff!"

"You gluttonous fellow!" Little Tomcat squinted his eyes and scolded him.

Dazed, the two children followed the crowd and arrived in front of the Five Kings Temple, stopping in their tracks.

There, the sounds of voices, gongs, and drums... resonated, as if the sky had fallen, extremely noisy. This stirred up the wild hearts of the two children once again. Little Tomcat acted like a field mouse, rushing around recklessly, and in a moment, he had squeezed into the crowd.

"Hey! Has the play started yet?" He stared wide-eyed, looking at the stage in confusion.

Then he squeezed out of the crowd and walked towards the low-lying area of Guanghan. There, people were shouting something:

"Come on, bet! Heavenly Gate, ...stay"

"Double, eight! Eat..."

"Short Seven, eat!"

Ah Hai wasn't familiar with these sounds, but he was curious. He looked at the densely packed crowd and wanted to go and take a look, but‚Äî

"Smack!" He was slapped by a man with a crooked face. This time, holding his swollen face, he turned back to complain to Little Tomcat, but Little Tomcat had also been squeezed out of the circle and had no idea where he was.

The play on stage had begun! But the two unfortunate children couldn't see it. Little Tomcat said resentfully:

"Let's go see Grandpa Five Kings!"

"Where is he?"

"In the hall."

The hall was filled with thick smoke from incense coils, and the surrounding thirty acres of fields were all trampled bare. Spring flowers withered on the ground, but people not only didn't feel sorry for them, but everyone wore smiling faces, vying to catch a glimpse of Grandpa Five Kings' magnificence, pathetically excited!

Grandpa Five Kings, although enshrined in the center, was still bald, naked, and barefoot, without having been consecrated„äÅ.

At this moment, a group of familiar women's figures were crowded in front of the white wooden shrine, burning incense, accompanied by a smartly dressed young man.

Ah! It was Pretty Sister Qiao Er. So they started to sing again:

"Kneel down! (A).

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Young lady knocks her head loudly,

Knocks her head loudly! (O)

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ May she marry a good man this year."

Pretty Sister Qiao Er panicked, her face darkened, and she dodged to the right, only to see the young man give her a lascivious smile. At the same time, he turned his face, raised his foot, and kicked Little Tomcat.

Little Tomcat didn't dare to resist, and they fled out of the temple gate.

Note „äÄ Village Stage Play: The first performance after a temple is completed is called a "Village Stage Play."

„äÅ Consecration: Consecration is to add powder, draw eyebrows, apply oil, and paint the pupils on that wooden figure.

### Backs Not Facing Heaven

‚Äî Shi Mengyu

I remember asking older people when I was a child, "Why do we kill chickens, pigs, and cows to eat?"

The older people said in a tone of instruction, "Chickens, pigs, and cows, because their backs are born facing heaven, anything whose back faces heaven can be killed and eaten by people!"

And so I suddenly understood: "People's backs don't face heaven, so there's no human meat for sale in the market; I haven't heard any stories of people killing and eating people in the village." After that, whenever I saw an animal whose back faced heaven, I thought it was something that deserved to die; even a tiny ant deserved to be killed without mercy.

## Page 20

As I grew older, I gradually heard stories of people killing and eating people. Later, I even saw with my own eyes a most noble and dignified gentleman in the village smash the head of a farmer who couldn't afford to pay his land rent with an axe. I began to have some doubts about the lessons of the older people! A jumping heart often wondered: "One day, will humans, whose backs don't face heaven, start eating each other?" The more I thought about it, the more afraid I became, afraid that one day I would be killed and eaten by someone.

There was a butcher next door, Chen Erpang, who was beating his son one day; his son's crying sounded like the cries of the pigs he slaughtered every morning. So I was very worried for my little friend, afraid that he would be slaughtered by his father like a pig! Sometimes, when I passed by the big chopping block in front of his shop, seeing it hung with red and white, bloody, dissected pork, I always had some doubts: "There might be human meat mixed in there‚Äîmy little friend's meat."

Once, my father came home drunk from outside, glaring at me fiercely with two white eyes, opening his mouth, revealing his sharp teeth, roaring, and pouncing on me; I was so frightened that I fainted and fell to the ground. When I woke up, I suspected that my father wanted to eat my meat. "Even father and son, the closest of blood relatives, will start eating each other!" Thinking of this made me tremble with fear, and I didn't dare to approach my father for several days.

And so for several years, whenever I met those who wielded knives, carried sticks, competed with clubs, or wore swords, even the Shandong strongmen who performed magic tricks, I always feared them, avoided them, deeply afraid of suffering misfortune and being devoured by them.

What makes humans valuable is "reason," this is not a clich√©; otherwise, are they worthy of being called "backs not facing heaven" "humans"? Imperialists are often called civilized countries of the modern century, and I partly agree; however, they lack one thing, which is "reason." So their actions rarely conform to humanity. Cruel behavior accounts for a large part.

There is also a group of people who have lost their "human" nature, but what they have gained is not "animal" nature, but "slave" nature! There are not a few of these people in the world, are there? They submit to the strong, flatter the wealthy, and when they see someone weaker and more powerless than them, they unleash their animal nature, kick them, or spit on them, or even gather a group of people whose backs don't face heaven, in a menacing manner, and make a fuss. I am truly ashamed for these people who are called "backs not facing heaven"!

### Afterthoughts

The Lizhi Amateur Broadcasting Society is organized by young comrades from the academic circles of this city who love music and singing. They use their spare time to study music together and voluntarily broadcast special programs for various radio stations every Saturday and Sunday. The purpose is pure and truly commendable. Recently, the society has voluntarily broadcast songs for various radio stations to promote domestic goods. The intention is appropriate and extremely commendable. It is heard that any domestic goods manufacturers who have a long-term program agreement with the radio station and want the society to broadcast special programs on Saturdays and Sundays can send a letter to the society to contact them. They will absolutely not accept remuneration. Those who have not made a program agreement with the radio station but want the society to broadcast voluntarily are also welcome, but the electricity bill must be paid by themselves. The society's address is at 999 Fuxu Road.

The Shanghai Public Education Center Peking Opera Team is established to promote noble entertainment and properly adjust the lives of citizens. Anyone with a pure purpose and aspiring to learn Peking Opera only needs to pay a monthly membership fee of one yuan to register and join. The team originally hired Mr. Wu Yuehua and Mr. Liu Songqiao as teachers. Recently, they have added Mr. Wang Yuqing as a teacher to facilitate the learning of new team members. Those who aspire to learn Peking Opera, why not come?

Film

### Star Magazine

In Yuan Muzhi's film "Street Angel," Zhou Xuan, who plays a small singing girl as a guest star, and Zhao Dan, who plays the trumpet player in the band, are mutually attracted to each other. They meet every morning and tease each other from time to time, musically responding to each other from the window, blowing and singing, to the point of complete harmony.

"Crossroads" is Shen Xiling's more successful masterpiece after "Boatwoman." It is like a realistic poem of life, a symphony of love.

"Lively and Energetic" went to Hengshan, Suzhou, to film the final scene of a fierce battle between the army and bandits. Recently, due to the intermittent rainy weather, part of the location crew has returned to Shanghai. A telegram was received to go to Suzhou again.

Cheng Bu Gao's new film "Dream Land" started auspiciously yesterday morning. This play is Hong Shen's most satisfying work, and the preparatory work was extremely thorough. Four sets were filmed in one go on the first day. The main actors are Tan Ying, Huang Naishuang, Shu Xiuwen, Li Lilian, Wu Yin, Wang Xianzai, Sun Min, Xie Jun, Xie Yunqing, and You Guangzhao, among others.

Shu Xiuwen and Tan Ying went to the company yesterday to film "Dream Land." Because it was the first time they had met this year, they talked for as long as half an hour.

Because of the excellent performance of "Crossroads," the Star authorities plan to expand the publicity. Currently, there are two types of souvenirs planned, one is a small notebook, and the other is blotting paper, both of which will be finely printed on high-quality paper and distributed to the audience in the future.

### The Screening Rights for "Song of theÊÖàÊØçÊõ≤"

Have Been Decided at the Jincheng Grand Theater

The Lianhua mega-film "Song of the Loving Mother" has now been decided to be screened at the Jincheng Grand Theater in the shortest possible time to satisfy the requests of audiences across the country. This film was made a long time ago, but its release has been delayed, which has long been desired by people in society. At that time, the film market will be sensational again.

"Song of the Loving Mother" is a great contribution co-directed by Luo Mingyou and Zhu Shilin and co-starred by all the stars of Lianhua. It cost more than 100,000 yuan and took more than a year to produce. The excellence of the talent and the abundance of material resources are undoubtedly unprecedented records in domestic films.

"Song of the Loving Mother" stars Chen Yan Yan, Li Lili, Li Zhuozhuo, Lin Chuchu, Mei Lin, Bai Lu, Gong Zhihua, Chen Juanjuan, Zhang Yi, Zheng Junli, Luo Peng, Han Langen, Liu Jiqun, Liu Qiong, Shang Guanwu, Hong Jingling, Yin Xiucen, etc. It seems like a gathering of Lianhua's heroes. In terms of acting skills, they are all hooked and fighting, each showing their ability in mutual competition.

"Song of the Loving Mother" contains deep maternal love, children's love, and the deepest family love. Regardless of ancient or modern times, Chinese or foreign, regardless of men, women, old, or young, all humans will be moved by watching this film because every scene in it is an expression of true nature, condensed with blood and tears.

### "The General's Daughter" is Completed

Huaan's Another New Production, Lianhua's Mega-Film "The General's Daughter," Has Been Completed and Has Been Approved by the Film Inspection Committee. It Will Be Screened in Shanghai's Highest Theaters in the Coming Days.

"The General's Daughter" is a revolutionary historical drama that writes about the hard struggle of party members in the revolutionary process. It contains a vast and profound human love and sincere love between men and women. It is majestic and vast, with a magnificent atmosphere.

The director of "The General's Daughter," He Mengfu, has long been famous in the drama world and has a deep understanding of film art. The "Moonlit Scenery" segment he directed in "Lianhua Symphony," a small test of his abilities, has already won great acclaim. "The General's Daughter" is his second directorial work and is naturally worth paying attention to.

Everyone knows that the female lead of "The General's Daughter," Li Zhuozhuo, is an actress with versatile performing talents. There is no need to say more. The male lead, Li Qing, is strong and has an extraordinary bearing. His history in the film industry is not long, but his attainments are very deep. This is his first Lianhua film as a lead actor, and his superb acting skills are enough to amaze people.
