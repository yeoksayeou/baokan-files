### Our River Defense Positions are Solid; Wuxi is Undergoing an Unprecedented Bloody Battle

A Unit of Japanese Troops Fiercely Attacked the North Gate and Were Repelled; Our Troops are Counterattacking in the Western Suburbs of Wuxing; The Situation is Tense on the Right Flank at Zha Pu and Xia Shi

The Eastern Theater Battle Situation: After Our Army's Defensive Lines Achieved Autonomous Status, All Units Were Able to Engage in Coordinated Combat. According to Yesterday's Frontline News, The Result of the Japanese Army's Continuous Fierce Assaults on Our Entire Line, With the Exception of the Wuxing Area, Whose Positions Were Too Exposed and Subjected to Flanking Attacks by Japanese Marines Landing at Several Locations on the West Bank of Taihu Lake, Forcing Us to Abandon the City, The Rest of Our Forces on All Fronts Are Extremely Stable. The Situation is as Follows: On the Left Flank, the Jiangyin Blockade Line, Although Repeatedly Bombarded by Japanese Naval and Air Forces, Remains Solid and Undamaged. The Army Advancing Westward from the Fushan to Changshu Area Has Been Firmly Blocked by Our Army at Duanshan to Changjing Town. However, in the Wuxi Area, Due to the Convenience of Transportation via the Xichang Highway and the Jinghu Railway, The Japanese Army's Mechanized Units Were Able to Make Full Use of. Although Our Loyal and Brave Soldiers Have Been Fighting Bloodily for Days on the Vertical Line of Phoenix Mountain, Baitan Mountain, and Zhoujing Alley, Our Fortifications Have Been Repeatedly Damaged by Three-Dimensional Bombardment. Yesterday Afternoon, A Unit of Japanese Troops, About Two Companies Strong, Under the Cover of Artillery and Tanks, Broke Through Northward from the Highway North of Dongting Town, Fiercely Attacking the North Gate of Wuxi. After Our Army Reinforced and Counterattacked, The Japanese Army Had Retreat to Yan Dai City. However, in the Dongting Town Area Along the Highway and the Zhoujing Alley Area Along the Railway, The Japanese Army Is Still Trying Hard to Advance. The Fighting Between the Previous Evening and Yesterday Morning Was Extremely Fierce, and the Sacrifices Were Extremely Great. In the Wuxing Area on the South Bank of Taihu Lake, Our Army, Because of Attacks on Jiapu Town and Meixiang and Other Places on the West Bank of Taihu Lake, Had to Painfully Withdraw from the City and Move Westward to Counterattack on the Line from the Jinghang National Highway to Hengshan in the West of Wuxing. The Marines Landing at Jiapu Are Not Numerous and Have Been Surrounded by Our Army. The Lakeside Area Is Not Difficult to Resolve. Those Landing at Dapu Estuary Are Also Under Siege. Because Reinforcements Are More Difficult via Waterways, No Major Changes Are Expected. As for the Right Flank, Because of the Withdrawal from Wuxing, The Positions North of Tongxiang Have Also Been Slightly Moved Backward, Forming a Parallel Line with the Troops on the South Bank of Taihu Lake. It Is Also Reported That in Order to Coordinate with the Battles Along the Coast of Taihu Lake, The Japanese Army Has Been Attacking Xia Shi and Zha Pu Very Urgently in the Past Two Days, So the Strongholds on This Line Have Suddenly Become Tense. However, Our Army Is Determined to Fight to the Death.

[Nanjing] News Regarding Capturing Chinese: Last Night There Was Still Fierce Fighting in Wuxi, and the Situation Was Very Tense. The Rumor That It Has Been Lost Cannot Be Believed. The Artillery Battle in the Jiangyin Area Was Very Fierce, But There Have Been No Changes in the Chinese Army's Positions. The Fighting on the South Bank of Taihu Lake Is Also Very Fierce. The Chinese Army Strenuously Counterattacked Last Night in an Attempt to Recapture Wuxing, and Is Still Engaged in a Bloody Battle. (Quick News Agency, 26th)

The Battle on the Main Front of the Jinghu Road Has Been Intensifying in Recent Days. On the Line from Wuxi to Jiangyin, Our Army Is Prepared and Ready to Resist and Will Never Give Up Easily. According to News Obtained by This Newspaper Yesterday, The Intensity of Tank Battles in Zhoujing Alley, East of Wuxi, Is Unprecedented in Recent Days. Dozens of Japanese Aircraft Indiscriminately Bombarded All Day Long, Causing Much Damage to Our Fortifications. Both Sides Advanced and Retreated Repeatedly, and Both Suffered Heavy Casualties. A Certain Unit of Our Army on This Line Has Repeatedly Inflicted Heavy Damage on the Japanese Army. It Has Been Breached by the Japanese Army Three Times Recently, But Has Been Able to Quickly Recapture the Lost Ground by Utilizing Night Attacks. One Saying Is That Yesterday, Due to Strategic Considerations, It Moved Backward, Causing Street Fighting to Break Out in Wuxi City. However, This Saying Is Still Difficult to Confirm.

The Rumor That Wuxi Fell at About 8:00 AM on the 25th, and That the Japanese Army Has Entered the City, Was Investigated by Reporters From Various Chinese and Foreign Sources Yesterday Morning. It Was Learned That Our Army Is Still Very Active There, and Is Waging a Guerrilla War With Them With Its Specialized Street Fighting Tactics. Moreover, Our Army Outside the City Is Also Employing Guerrilla Tactics to Attack the Enemy's Eastern Flank, Killing More Than 60 Japanese Soldiers, and Destroying Two Japanese Tanks on the Main Front of the Jinghu Road. (Hua Dong News Agency)

Our Army, Which Was Defending Wuxing, After Several Days of Resistance, Unfortunately, The Japanese Army Detoured to the South Bank of Taihu Lake, Using Small Motorboats to Launch Sneak Attacks on the North Gate of Wuxing from Longxi in Daqianzhen and Xiaomeigang in Xiaomeikou. In Order to Avoid Being Attacked from Both Sides, Our Army Had to Retreat to New Positions, Causing the County Seat, Which Had Been Defended for Many Days, to Temporarily Fall the Other Day. However, Currently, the Focus of the Battle on This Line Has Shifted Westward Along the Wu (Xing)-Chang (Xing) Highway to the Lijiagang, Zhonghengtang, and Hengshan Areas. There Are Many High Mountains and Ridges Nearby, Which Are Naturally Dangerous. Our Army Is Determined to Defend Firmly to Prevent the Japanese Army from Continuing to Advance. We Have Now Increased Reinforcements and Defense, Including Along the Coast of Taihu Lake, and Occasionally Launch Surprise Attacks to Harass the Flanks of the Japanese Army. On the Previous Two Days, There Were Still Counterattacks by Our Army in the Suburbs of Wuxing, and the Fighting Was Very Fierce. Also, Large Numbers of Japanese Aircraft Flew to Bomb Changxing, Wuzhen, Yixing, Nanjing, and Other Places Yesterday.

### We Are Still Firmly Defending the Chengxi Highway

The Highway From Jiangyin to Wuxi Is Still Being Firmly Defended by Our Army. The Japanese Army's Mechanized Units Are Very Active. Fortunately, Our Loyal and Brave Soldiers Rely on Solid Fortifications to Calmly Resist, and the Defensive Line Remains Unmoved. It Is Rumored That Japanese Troops Have Landed on Changyinsha, Which Is Somewhat Possible. This Sandbar Extends Eastward From Luyuan in Changshu, Westward to Duanshan in Jiangyin, and Southward to the Border of Changshu. The Japanese Navy Passes Through the Center of the River and Strikes Directly at Maozhuzhen Near Duanshan. Its Army Then Proceeds Directly to Duanshan From Fushan and Changshu. The Naval and Land Forces Jointly Invade. This Place Is Still About Seventy Li by Land From Jiangyin County Seat, So At Present, the War on the Yangtze River Is Still Developing Near Duanshan. The Frontal Conflict at Jiangyin Is Temporarily Only Japanese Aircraft Activity. The Guerrilla War Between Kunshan and Qingyang Port Has Become More Intense in Recent Days, And Our Guerrilla Teams Scattered in the Hushu Pass Area of Suzhou Rely on the Natural Hazards of the Mountains and Ridges and Are Very Active, Repeatedly Achieving Remarkable Success. In the Western Part of Shanghai, Every Time It Is Late at Night, We Can Often Faintly Hear Scattered Gunfire, Which Is The Reason.

[Zhenjiang] Our Army Has Deployed a Second Blockade Line Near Zhenjiang, Which Has Been Completed. It Is Even More Solid Than the First Line in Jiangyin, and the River Defense Can Be Guaranteed Without Worry. (Special Dispatch, 26th)

### The Situation at Xia Shi on the Right Flank Is Very Tense

According to This Morning's News, Our Army on the Right Flank Is Defending the Xia Shi-Changan Line Along the Huhang Road, and Other Elite Troops Are Defending the Old Huhang Road (According to the Coastline and Various Strongholds Along Hangzhou Bay, From Zha Pu in the South to Haiyan in the West, and From Wengjiabu to Hangzhou). In the Past Two Days, the Japanese Army Has Fiercely Attacked Xia Shi on the Main Front of the Huhang Line. In Addition to Our Army Firmly Defending With Elite Troops, It Has Also Launched Flanking Attacks From the Left and Right By Certain Detachments. As of Last Night, Although the Situation Was Tense, There Were No Major Problems. According to Mr. Chen, a Fellow Townsman Who Had Just Arrived Here, Who Was Received By the Haiyan Township Association, When He Left Haiyan on the 17th, There Were No Abnormalities in the City Except for Enemy Aircraft Bombing. However, There Was Artillery Fire Along the Coastal Embankment, and All the Residents Had Been Evacuated. (Hua Dong News Agency)

The Transport Ships Were Docked at the Huangpu Wharf, the Qiujiang Wharf, and the Gonghexing Wharf, Where They Were Unloaded and Taken Ashore Separately and Transported to the Ordnance Storage Depot for Temporary Storage, to Be Used for Forwarding to the Front Lines.

The Japanese Army Has Been Transporting Munitions and Food to the Front Lines Mostly Via the Suzhou River and the Huangpu River in Recent Days, So the Ships and Tugboats Traveling Back and Forth in These Two Rivers Have Been Running Non-Stop Day and Night for the Past Few Days. Occasionally, Reinforcements Are Also Transported to the Front Lines by Ship Via These Two Waterways. (Da Gong News Agency)

### An Overview of the Soviet Republic of Kirghizia

Barren Mountainous Areas Completely Transformed, Remarkable Progress in Agriculture and Industry

▲ Moscow Dispatch, TASS, October - The Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic, located in western Asia, covers an area of 200,000 square kilometers, equivalent to the combined area of Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Twenty years ago, this region was known as a "rocky land." In the Russian Empire, known as a "prison of peoples," the region's status was almost that of a condemned prisoner awaiting execution. The brutal exploitation by Tsarist officials and local nobles brought the people to the brink of extinction. In the decade from 1903 to 1913, the population of the entire region decreased by one-tenth. The older generation still remembers the hardship of that time.

Before the revolution, the most fertile farmland and pasture belonged entirely to nobles and wealthy farmers, while the peasants were confined to the mountains. In 1916, the people, unable to endure the suffering, launched an uprising, but it was brutally suppressed by the Tsarist government. Only after the October Revolution did Kirghizia embark on the path of economic and cultural development. Through sharp struggles against enemies of the people, bourgeois nationalists, and Trotskyite-Bukharinite spies who were exposed and eliminated, the people finally achieved great success in socialist construction.

This success, similar to that of other Soviet republics in the East, clearly demonstrates the correctness of a fundamental principle of Lenin and Stalin's national policy: that backward nations can directly transition from pre-capitalist systems to socialism without going through a capitalist stage, as long as these nations receive assistance from the proletariat of advanced countries. The history of socialist construction in Kirghizia is an example of this transition process, made possible by the continuous assistance of the Russian working class.

Before the revolution, Kirghizia had no industry to speak of. Now, thanks to the aforementioned assistance, it has created many factories for cotton ginning, sugar refining, textiles, silk reeling, leather making, meat processing, and machinery. Compared to 1913, its industrial production has increased 95-fold. All the minerals in the territory, such as coal, sulfur, mercury, antimony, lead, tin, zinc, silver, and copper, have been explored and mined by scientists. Since the people have become masters of their homeland and its natural resources, their lives have also completely changed. A national working class has emerged, and the majority of nomadic people have settled on the land, engaging in agricultural development. Agriculture, which was extremely backward in the region in the past, has not only doubled its cultivated land, but ancient wooden plows and sickles have also been replaced by modern tractors and harvesters.

After collective farmers were granted 800,000 hectares of land for their perpetual free use, they embarked on the road to developing large-scale agriculture. For example, the region did not produce sugar beets before the revolution, but last year's harvest set a record for the entire Soviet Union, averaging 300 kilograms per hectare. Agriculture has also developed in the mountains; wheat now ripens at altitudes of 3,000 meters. At the same time, the local people's traditional animal husbandry has also made unprecedented progress. The prosperity of the people's lives has reached an unprecedented level and continues to rise. In the past three years, the income of workers and employees has roughly doubled, while the income of collective farms has increased two and a half times during the same period. Many farms have incomes exceeding one million, and countless outstanding cotton-growing collective farm households earn tens of thousands annually. The region's state budget recently confirmed its great economic and cultural growth, increasing 50-fold in twelve years, reaching 270 million rubles in 1937, of which 115 million was for education. Before the revolution, almost the entire population was illiterate. Now, there are 1,800 schools with 200,000 students, an increase of 172 times compared to 1913. In addition, there are several universities. The new Kirghiz alphabet has been created, which has greatly contributed to eliminating illiteracy. Currently, there are 45 newspapers and 3 magazines printed in the local language. Nine national theaters have been established, and talents such as national writers, artists, composers, and actors are emerging in large numbers.

Good roads, totaling 2,000 kilometers, have now been built through the rugged and difficult mountains and ridges of the past. The project was immense, including opening mountains, building bridges, filling rivers, and digging tunnels. Cars are gradually replacing camels for transportation on the roads, and air transportation is also developing. The conditions in cities and rural areas have been improved. The capital, Frunze, has been completely transformed, with new-style apartments, parks, and public buildings. The entire region has about 150 libraries, 300 clubs, and 250 cinemas. The population of Kirghizia, which decreased before the revolution, has now changed and is gradually increasing due to the improved material and cultural standards and advances in public health. The entire region now has 1.5 million people. In addition to Kirghiz people, there are also Russians, Ukrainians, Germans, Uzbeks, Uyghurs, Dungans, and Kalmyks. They are able to unite, cooperate harmoniously, and receive assistance from the Soviet government, enabling their lives and their homeland to become increasingly comfortable and prosperous.

### Avenue Road Vegetable Market to Reopen Soon

There are originally two small vegetable markets in the Huishan Hongkou area, one at the intersection of North Henan Road and Peng Road, one on Avenue Road, and one at the intersection of North Fujian Road and Tiantong Road. Since the Shanghai war, the North Henan Road and Avenue Road vegetable markets have been closed, with only the North Fujian Road market remaining open. Now that order in the area has gradually been restored and more residents are returning, the one vegetable market has become overcrowded. In order to regulate and facilitate residents' vegetable purchases, the authorities have decided to reopen the vegetable market on Avenue Road, and it is said that it will officially reopen on the first day of next month.

### Tensions Rise in Japanese-Soviet Relations, War Imminent

500,000 Japanese Troops Concentrated on the Manchurian-Mongolian Border, Soviet Union Appoints New Deputy Commissar for War

[London] Today, a correspondent for the "Daily Herald" in Shanghai published an article in the Labor Party's newspaper, stating that Japanese-Russian relations are becoming increasingly tense. The correspondent pointed out that the Soviet authorities are greatly concerned about Japan's deployment of 500,000 troops to the border between "Manchukuo" and Inner Mongolia. It is reported that 1,500 aircraft have been concentrated in the Soviet Far East, and a large fleet of submarines has been assembled in Vladivostok. The newspaper commented that the Japanese military has suggested launching a preventive war against the Soviet Union. Now that Soviet Russia has amassed military strength in the Far East, Japan may use this as a pretext to declare general mobilization against Russia. (National Maritime Telegraph, 26th)

[Moscow] Shadenko has recently been appointed Deputy Commissar for War and will be the political commander of the Soviet Army and Navy. The military commander is Voroshilov. (Reuters, 26th)

### Situation Change Could Lead to Japanese Declaration of War on China

Statement by Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson, Combined Fleet Strengthening Combat Power

[Tokyo] A Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated today that if the current situation remains unchanged, Japan may not declare war on China. However, if changes occur, it is difficult to say for sure. As to what these so-called changes refer to, the spokesperson declined to explain. (Reuters, 26th)

[Tokyo] The Imperial Japanese General Headquarters Navy Group stated today that in response to the recent developments in the army's operations in the Shanghai area, the Combined Fleet, commanded by Commander Nagano, will return to ports in Japan to quickly load necessary supplies and replenish manpower, thereby strengthening its combat power. (Reuters, 26th)

[Tokyo] Japanese newspapers are advocating for an immediate declaration of war on China, stating that if Japan officially declares war on China, third parties will not be able to supply China with military equipment. (Express News Agency, 25th)

### British House of Commons Debates Status of Shanghai Concessions

Undersecretary Cranborne Responds to Questions, Acknowledges the Difficult Situation of the Municipal Council

[London] Today in the House of Commons, British Undersecretary Cranborne, in response to questions from Labour MP Benn, explained the position of the Shanghai Municipal Council regarding the demands made by the Japanese military authorities. Benn first inquired whether the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai would allow British citizens to inspect their properties inside and outside the concessions without obstruction. Cranborne replied that he had spoken about this before and had nothing further to add. Benn stated that he knew Cranborne had not denied the fact that the Japanese side did not allow British citizens to enter their properties inside and outside the concessions. Cranborne replied that there had been further negotiations on this matter yesterday, but he could not say anything further about the actual status of Shanghai. Benn then asked what kind of response the Municipal Council had given to the demands made by the Japanese Consul-General, including preventing Chinese people from posting leaflets, distributing literature, and broadcasting, closing down various organs of the Chinese government, expelling Chinese personnel, and abolishing the inspection of Chinese mail. Benn also asked whether any Chinese officials had been expelled as a result and whether the Municipal Council had the right to adopt some or all of these measures without the consent of the Chinese government. Had the British members of the Municipal Council consulted with the British government on the course of action they would take? Cranborne replied that he knew the Shanghai Municipal Council was currently under pressure from the Japanese authorities to adopt measures of the aforementioned nature. As far as he knew, the Municipal Council was an international body and had not yet issued a statement explaining its attitude towards the aforementioned points. The British members of the Municipal Council had also not consulted with the British government on the course of action they would take. The Municipal Council had no right to expel people except through legal procedures. The Municipal Council's powers were derived from the Land Regulations. According to these regulations, the power of the Municipal Council over security and administration was granted by the Chinese government. The precise limits of this power was a matter that remained to be interpreted. The primary responsibility was that of the Municipal Council. In the current extremely difficult circumstances, he did not think it was appropriate to attempt any interpretation of the Municipal Council's position at this time. At this point, Benn raised further questions: 1. Was it true that Soong Tzu-wen had left Shanghai? 2. Did Cranborne mean that the five British members of the Municipal Council were in some sense independent authorities? 3. Was it true that the Land Regulations were agreed upon by the British diplomatic representative and the Chinese government? 4. Did the Japanese demands undermine Chinese sovereignty? Cranborne replied that the Municipal Council was indeed an international body enjoying an independent status outside the government. The British members of the Council had not sought instructions from the British government. If they had, the British government would have considered it. Regarding the Soong Tzu-wen matter, he could not comment immediately, but he had heard that no Chinese officials had been expelled. Other Labour MPs also wanted to ask questions, but the Speaker asked them to submit them in writing. Finally, Benn asked Cranborne whether he wanted the House to accept that the five British members of the Municipal Council had not consulted with the British Consul-General in Shanghai on this matter. Cranborne replied that this was a very difficult legal question, but what he was saying was that the British members of the Council had not consulted with the British government. At this point in the debate, the Speaker stopped further questioning. (Reuters, 26th)

[Tokyo] A Foreign Ministry spokesperson mentioned today that Foreign Minister Hirota and British Ambassador Craigie had met yesterday, saying that apart from exchanging opinions and information on the Shanghai situation, there was nothing else. He also said that the Shanghai situation was now progressing in a better direction and that cooperation between the Japanese authorities and the Public Concession's Municipal Council was proceeding very well. (Reuters, 26th)

### American Newspapers Observe the Sino-Japanese War

[New York] Scripps-Howard newspapers commented today that if Japan is victorious in its war against China, the United States will consider it a direct threat to the Americas and other democratic nations, forcing democratic nations to adopt defensive plans. Once Japan controls China, it will be the sole power in Asia, dominating half the world's population. At that time, the Philippines, the East Indies, India, Australia, New Zealand, and the entire West Pacific will not be spared. According to information received by American officials, Japan's ambition is indeed to control the entire world. Without a strong power standing up, Japan's actions will not stop. Japanese General Staff officers even believe that the United States will not exert itself to protect the Philippine Islands. If Japanese residents in the Philippines are in danger and ask for help, Japan is prepared to send the navy to rescue them. The Japanese military also believes that the United States will be powerless to do anything about it. Washington officials are gradually believing that Japan will not stop until it has seized trade, raw materials, and strategic military locations in China, the Philippines, India, and the East Indies. Washington diplomatic circles believe that it is possible that the three naval powers of Britain, the United States, and France will ultimately cooperate to deal with the situation in the Far East. Otherwise, we can only watch helplessly as half the world refuses to open its doors to us. (National Telegraph, 26th)

### British Merchant Ships Preparing to Resume Shanghai Service

[London] The British Transport Company recently announced that its merchant ship "Lapland" will sail into the port of Shanghai on January 7th next year.

Its first merchant ship to Shanghai, the "Agamemnon," will sail from Liverpool on December 11th. (Reuters, 26th)

### Anti-British Propaganda by the Japanese

Becoming Increasingly Heated Recently

[Tokyo] Anti-British propaganda in Japanese newspapers has become increasingly heated recently, pointing out that 12 tons of British-made phosgene gas were recently transferred to China via Hong Kong. The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" also said that the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai now have secret Chinese documents proving that Chinese soldiers fighting near the British defense zone in Shanghai during the resistance against Japan received various conveniences from the British side. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson, in response to questions from reporters today, stated that he was unaware of these documents. It was not easy to explain the reasons for anti-British propaganda, but those who paid attention would not find it difficult to understand. Observers believe this is a reaction to British anti-Japanese actions, but the anti-Japanese sentiment of other countries is indeed even stronger than that of Britain. (Reuters, 26th)

[Tokyo] A Foreign Ministry spokesperson told foreign journalists today that although Japan opposes foreign aid to China, it is not afraid of it. Putting themselves in Japan's position, they would recognize that Japan's opposition is natural. A foreign journalist asked why Japanese newspapers only focused on British shipments of military supplies to China and did not mention other countries. The spokesperson replied that he had not recently received any information about German ships transporting military supplies to China. (Reuters, 26th)

### Italian Fascist Party Members Demonstrate Against Russia

Japanese Embassy Staff Carry Flags at the Head, Chanting "Down with the Reds"

[Rome] To celebrate the first anniversary of the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact, the Fascist Party held a friendship parade outside the Japanese Embassy last night.

Later, about 200 Italians demonstrated outside the Soviet Embassy, shouting "Down with the Reds." (Reuters, 26th)

[Rome] Yesterday, several thousand Roman citizens held a rally in front of the Japanese Embassy to celebrate the first anniversary of the signing of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact. At that time, the police authorities dispatched a large number of police to maintain strict security near the French Embassy to prevent anti-French demonstrations. When the crowd held a rally in front of the Japanese Embassy, Fascist Party Secretary Starace personally participated and gave a speech expressing sympathy for Japan. Japanese Ambassador Horita then appeared on the balcony and was greeted with cheers from the crowd. (Havas, 25th)

### New Japanese Ambassador to Germany Togo Proceeds to Post

Italian Minister to the Netherlands Transferred to Japan

[Tokyo] The newly appointed Ambassador to Germany, Shigenori Togo, departed from Tokyo Station at 9:00 this morning for Kobe. He is scheduled to leave Japan tomorrow morning at 9:00 aboard the German ship "Gneisenau" to take up his post. When the ambassador left Tokyo, Foreign Minister Hirota and many officials and civilians came to the station to see him off. The ambassador said in the car that, looking at the world situation, not only are there movements in the Far East, but all parts of the world are constantly moving. Regarding these movements, we must consider the degree of urgency and should not burden other countries. No force can suppress Japan's development. Chancellor Hitler and those close to him seem to understand the Japanese spirit, so I am confident that the relations between Japan and Germany will become closer in the future. (Domei, 26th)

The Hague - According to news here today, the Italian Minister to the Netherlands, Attolico, will be recalled to his country in the near future and appointed as Ambassador to Japan. (Haitong, 26th)

El Salvador - Authoritative sources here recently commented on the question of whether El Salvador would join the Anti-Comintern Pact. The source pointed out that El Salvador had not received an invitation to join the Pact from any of the signatory countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact. If such an invitation is received in the future, the issue of joining would be carefully considered before a decision is made. It is said that although the government of El Salvador knows that there is an anti-communist trend in domestic public opinion, it feels that there is no need to formally join the Pact. (Haitong, 26th)

### German Newspapers Comment on the Far East Conference

Germany Mediating the Sino-Japanese Dispute, Tokyo Claims to Have Received No Information

[Berlin] After the indefinite postponement of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, German political figures commented that the second declaration passed by the conference merely restated the principles listed at the time of its convening. Therefore, the failure of the conference was undeniable. The Politisch-Diplomatische Korrespondenz wrote that Germany had doubted the effectiveness of the conference from the beginning, "because if the mediation work carried out by the conference is to be successful, both parties concerned must participate and cooperate, and absolutely believe that the conference can discuss all outstanding issues between the two parties with a fair attitude and put aside all minor interests." Most countries have material interests in the Far East, "therefore, the various inappropriate methods used by the League of Nations should be avoided in order to prevent the Far Eastern situation from becoming more serious." (Havas, 5th)

[Tokyo] A Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated today that Tokyo had not received official information regarding reports that German Chancellor Hitler was mediating the Sino-Japanese dispute. Reports that Italy and Germany were recognizing "Manchukuo" were also rumors and inaccurate. Although no one can predict future developments, there is no basis for saying that Italy and Germany are currently planning to recognize "Manchukuo." (Reuters, 26th)

### After the Adjournment of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, US Representative Davis Arrives in Paris

The Scope of Future British-French Talks is Extensive, Covering Both Political and Economic Issues

Beijing - After the indefinite adjournment of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, US Chief Representative Davis led the delegation to Paris this morning and is scheduled to return to New York by ship from France on the 2nd of next month. (Havas, 26th)

[London] Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that the visit of Lord Privy Seal Halifax to Berlin would of course be one of the events discussed when the French cabinet members visit Britain next week. French Premier Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos have accepted the invitation of the British government and are scheduled to visit London on November 29th and 30th. The purpose of this visit is to exchange views on the international situation with the British government. (Reuters, 25th)

[London] French Premier Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos will come here next Monday to hold talks with British political leaders. It is reported that the British government will propose to the French Premier and Foreign Minister that, regarding Germany's demand for colonies, Britain should put forward a counter-proposal, namely, to allow Germany to sell its manufactured goods as much as possible in its former colonies. In addition, it is rumored that the issue of the Western European Air Pact or the issue of arms reduction will now be raised again. (Havas, 26th)

[London] Regarding the visit of French Premier Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos to hold talks here, although the British government has not revealed the nature of the talks, it is generally believed that the two sides will not take any surprising decisions. After Chautemps and Delbos arrive here, Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to host a banquet to entertain them, accompanied by a small number of cabinet members. Generally, apart from Foreign Secretary Eden, those invited to participate will only be Lord Chancellor Hailsham, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, and Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Vansittart. Simon's participation in the talks shows that in addition to discussing political issues, Britain and France will also discuss various economic issues, especially the issue of reducing import tariffs between the two countries. It is generally believed here that the political situation will inevitably improve after import tariffs are reduced. In addition, it is generally believed that the economic negotiations between Britain and France must be related to the commercial negotiations between Britain and the United States. (Havas, 25th)

### Chen Gongbo Still in Brussels

[Tokyo] Today's cabinet meeting decided to dismiss Georg Heintz Del Garotte, Honorary Consul in Barcelona, Spain. This is a preparatory action by the Japanese government to recognize the Franco regime. (Domei, 26th)

[Tokyo] This morning, a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry issued an important statement declaring that the Tokyo political world knew nothing about the news carried in foreign newspapers that Germany and Italy were about to formally recognize "Manchukuo." The spokesman said that all he could say was that Japan would soon recognize the Franco government. (Haitong, 26th)

### Germany and Siam Negotiating

To Develop Commercial Relations

### Friendship Between Germany and Hungary Increases

Sincere Cooperation Between the Two Countries, Results of Talks in Berlin

[Berlin] Hungarian Prime Minister Darányi, who is currently here for talks with German authorities, told the press that cooperation between Germany and Hungary is aimed at peace, justice, international equality, and improving the lives of both countries. Hungary is prepared to cooperate with all peaceful policies that respect the interests and demands of all countries related to survival, are based on realism, and seek to restore normalcy. Hungary's pursuit of this policy is supported by Germany's sincere friendship on the one hand, and closely cooperates with Italy and Austria within the scope of the Italian-Austrian-Hungarian protocol on the other hand. I came to Berlin this time and exchanged views with the German authorities on general issues. (Havas, 26th)

Hungary - Regarding the talks conducted by Hungarian Prime Minister Darányi in Berlin, newspapers here recently reported that Hungary had obtained substantial benefits as a result of the talks. Germany had agreed not to protect German Nazi Party members in Hungary and abandoned the proposal that Hungary must join the Anti-Comintern Pact. Germany also agreed to provide spiritual support to Hungary's demands on the issue of minorities and the revision of the Treaty of Trianon. In return, Prime Minister Darányi only agreed to reform the education system for the German minority in Hungary. Hungary is currently seeking to approach the countries of the Little Entente, but the country's demand to revise the treaty is somewhat contradictory to this attempt. It is not yet known whether Hungary has granted Germany any economic benefits. (Havas, 26th)

### The Three Missions Endowed Upon Austria Seeking Freedom and Independence

(Havas Dispatch, 24th)

### French Premier Overcomes Cabinet Crisis Before Trip to England

Civil Servant Pay Raise Bill Finally Passes the Chamber of Deputies

[Paris] Premier Chautemps intended to clear the political air before embarking on his trip to England. However, this aspiration suffered a slight setback last night when the Socialist members of the Chamber of Deputies rejected the government's proposal to appropriately increase civil servant salaries to cope with the rising cost of living by a vote of 90 to 3. Subsequently, however, the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies ultimately approved the government's proposal. It is widely believed that this move by the Finance Committee will prevent a cabinet crisis in France. During the Chamber of Deputies' debate on the civil servant bill, the atmosphere was quite tense. Finance Minister Bonnet stated that his position was that the increase in civil servant salaries should not exceed 1.7 billion francs. Premier Chautemps spoke, requesting the support of the Radical Socialists, saying that he had been extremely fair in his efforts for civil servants and could not go any further. He was determined not to unbalance the budget and endanger the nation's currency, and those who disagreed were welcome to take responsibility for overthrowing the government. As it stands, it seems someone is secretly maneuvering to obstruct his trip to London. (Reuters Dispatch, 26th)

[Paris] When the bill to increase salaries for civil servants was submitted for discussion in the Chamber of Deputies at 11:30 last night, Premier Chautemps had already proposed a vote of confidence, requesting the Chamber's approval. The Chamber ultimately passed the bill by an overwhelming majority of 521 votes to 4, with 80 abstentions, thereby enacting the law. In addition, all amendments proposed by members of various parties were rejected one by one. Prior to this, members of the Communist Party had stated that Finance Minister Bonnet's tough stance toward civil servants should have been applied to the banks. Although the party did not dare agree with the government's approach, it still agreed to vote in favor in order to safeguard the People's Front. Premier Chautemps also delivered a speech, urging all civil servants to prioritize the nation's interests. According to estimates, the implementation of this bill will increase government expenditure by 1,700,000,000 francs annually. (Havas Dispatch, 26th)

### Italian Newspapers Launch Anti-French Propaganda

Vehemently Attack French Naval Minister's Speech

[Rome] The well-known journalist Gayda recently published an article in the semi-official newspaper "Il Giornale d'Italia" entitled "Call to Arms." The article concerned the speech given by the French Naval Minister Campinchi to the crew of the "Napoléon" ship in Toulon on October 23rd. Campinchi purportedly said that the people of Corsica (Napoleon's hometown) were loyal to the nation and that, should the island ever be invaded, they would do everything possible to defend it. In addition to publishing the full text of the speech, Gayda claimed that it was a provocative act. His conclusion was, "Anyone who dares to threaten Italy via the Alps will be met with a fierce counterattack by 45 million newly armed Italians." Furthermore, "La Tribuna" also fiercely criticized Campinchi's speech, calling it an "unheard-of provocative act." Campinchi himself has solemnly denied giving the speech, stating that it never happened. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)

[Rome] Following "Il Giornale d'Italia's" vehement attack on French Naval Minister Campinchi's alleged speech yesterday, it is generally believed that this is a prelude to launching anti-French propaganda. Observers note that this action coincides with the German government's celebration of the anniversary of the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany and Japan, which is particularly noteworthy. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)

### Leader of French Cagoulards Arrested

Plans for Military Activities Continue to Be Discovered by the Police

[Paris] Regarding the Cagoulard (hooded men) activities, the police released startling news today, stating that two nationally known figures have been arrested: General Duseigneur and Oncana, a technical consultant at the Penhoët shipyard and manager of several shipbuilding companies. The newly discovered secret organization of the Cagoulards is officially named the "Secret Committee of Revolutionary Action," with Oncana as its leader and General Duseigneur as his deputy. The arrest of these two men was the result of a midnight consultation between the Chief of Police and the Minister of Interior. After Oncana's arrest, he was escorted to the Police Headquarters by four police officers. At the same time, the police also discovered the Cagoulard's plan to recruit North African natives to organize an "Algerian French" apparatus. According to this plan, ten natives would form a group under the command of a native officer, and every three groups would be led by a European platoon leader. Natives with military training or special skills, such as machine gunners, would receive special treatment. (Reuters Dispatch, 26th)

[Paris] The police now believe that there are about 1,500 Cagoulards in Paris and estimate that there are more than 5,000 members throughout France. Parisian architect Barent was arrested yesterday afternoon. It is reported that police searched his residence and discovered weapons hidden in the basement. (Reuters Dispatch, 26th)

### Funeral Held for Ramsay MacDonald's Remains

[London] Former Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, who died en route to South America, had his remains transported here. His funeral was held this afternoon at Westminster Abbey in a very simple ceremony. The Duke of Gloucester, representing the King, and Lord Hamilton, representing Queen Mary, attended to pay their respects. In addition, Prime Minister Chamberlain, most of the cabinet members, and the ambassadors of the Soviet Union, Italy, Egypt, and Portugal personally attended to offer condolences. After the funeral service, the remains will be cremated, and the ashes will be transported to Scotland, MacDonald's hometown, for burial tomorrow. (Havas Dispatch, 26th)

[London] When the memorial service for former Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald was held at Westminster Abbey, Parliament and other buildings in London flew flags at half-mast to express grief. Those who attended the memorial service included the King's representative, cabinet members, members of both Houses of Parliament, and ambassadors from various countries. Friends and foes of MacDonald gathered to offer their condolences. The coffin was draped with the national flag and surrounded by wreaths. Prime Minister Chamberlain, Speaker of the House FitzRoy, former Prime Minister Baldwin, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, and Labour Party leader Attlee were among those who carried the coffin into the Abbey. The ceremony was extremely solemn. Finally, the Archbishop of Canterbury recited a benediction. Tonight, the remains will be transported to Scotland for burial tomorrow in his hometown of Lossiemouth. (Reuters Dispatch, 26th)

### French Labor Groups' Unified Organization

Rejected by the Socialist Party

[Paris] Regarding the issue of establishing a unified organization for various labor groups, the Standing Committee of the Socialist Party recently passed a resolution by a majority vote of all but one, rejecting the proposal. (Only Left-wing Deputy Zyromski voted in favor.) This matter was initiated by the Communist Party. However, Dimitrov, Secretary-General of the Third International, recently published an article in the French Communist Party's newspaper "L'Humanité," stating that the reliability of each labor group depends on its attitude toward Soviet Russia. In other words, socialism must be subordinate to Bolshevism before a unified organization of labor groups can be considered. Socialist Party members, however, are unwilling to sacrifice independence to serve the private interests of any foreign government. The resolution passed by the Standing Committee of the Socialist Party today stated that the move toward a unified organization is tantamount to a merger of the Socialist and Communist parties. Given the views expressed by Dimitrov, this is practically impossible. Therefore, it is hoped that the Executive Committee of the Third International will revise Dimitrov's views, at which point the joint committee formed by the Socialist and Communist parties should also temporarily suspend negotiations. (Havas Dispatch, 26th)

### Spanish Government Determined to Fight to the End

Investigation into the Issue of Withdrawing Volunteer Soldiers, Rebel Authorities Submit Response

Madrid - General Miaja, leader of the Spanish Republican Army, today denied reports of Spain negotiating a truce, saying that he is determined to fight until complete victory and will never negotiate with those who bring foreign troops to invade Spain. (Reuters Dispatch, 26th)

Madrid - Both the Spanish government and the Nationalist forces are now preparing for the most intense civil war. Government officials believe that the current heavy artillery bombardment of Madrid and the aerial attacks on Guadalajara are merely diversionary tactics. They anticipate that the main Nationalist offensive will be in Aragon, so they are transferring fresh troops to reinforce defenses there. According to official sources, 25 people in Madrid died from artillery shelling last night, and at least 50 people in Guadalajara died from aerial bombings, with many more injured. (Reuters Dispatch, 26th)

San Sebastián - 100,000 Spanish Nationalist soldiers are now taking advantage of the clear weather to move from the north to the front lines, preparing for a general offensive. (Reuters Dispatch, 26th)

[London] As a result of the meeting between German leader Hitler and British Foreign Secretary Halifax, the United Kingdom and Germany may attempt to mediate the Spanish Civil War. There have been repeated rumors of a truce recently. It is reported that British Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Premier Chautemps will also discuss this matter soon. At the same time, formal discussions have taken place within the Spanish Embassy in London since Lord Halifax returned to England, which is also noteworthy. The Prime Minister stated to the House of Commons that the United Kingdom does not intend to form any agreement with Germany that would affect the security of France. According to the government, the Foreign Office has received a response from General Franco, leader of the Spanish rebels, accepting the recommendations of the Non-Intervention Committee, but requesting clarification on some points. This response has been forwarded to the Non-Intervention Committee for discussion at its meeting on Friday. Some observers believe that the issue will not be raised at Friday's meeting pending receipt of the Republican government's response, at which point both will be considered. (National Telegraph, 26th)

[London] Regarding the dispatch of an international investigation team to Spain to prepare for the withdrawal of foreign volunteer soldiers, the Non-Intervention Committee recently sent notes to both sides of the Spanish Civil War to solicit their opinions. The Republican government has not yet issued a response, but the Nationalist response has been received here. The Nationalist government requests clarification on the responsibilities of the investigation team and asks whether it is limited to investigating the number of foreign volunteer soldiers. Furthermore, it proposes that as soon as both sides of the civil war withdraw 3,000 foreign volunteer soldiers each, other countries should recognize belligerent status. This is essentially a "symbolic withdrawal" followed by immediate recognition of belligerent status, even though the Committee has already rejected this approach. It is unlikely that this proposal will be accepted by representatives from countries other than Italy, Germany, and Portugal. British officials even dismiss it as absurd. Regarding this matter, representatives from the United Kingdom, France, and Russia held informal talks during the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Beijing. It is reported that they proposed that recognition of belligerent status should only occur after 70% of all foreign volunteer soldiers have been withdrawn. Currently, the Nationalist forces have about 40,000 Italian volunteer soldiers and about 10,000 German volunteer soldiers. If the Nationalist government's proposal to recognize belligerent status after withdrawing 3,000 soldiers is adopted, it would fall far short of the 70% standard proposed by the United Kingdom, France, and Russia.

### Japan Expands Air Force

Ministry of Communications Plans Five-Year Project, Actively Trains Aviation Talents

[Tokyo] Because civilian aviators serve as a reserve force for the air force, the Ministry of Communications has been consulting with relevant authorities on concrete methods to enhance the number of civilian aviators. Most recently, it has decided on its first step: to establish five national aviation schools at the middle school level and one aviation school at the vocational school level in the next fiscal year, as institutions for training young civilian aviators. Each middle school-level aviation school will also have an affiliated airfield. The cost is estimated at 10 million yen, which has been approved in principle by the Ministry of Finance. This project will be implemented from fiscal year Showa 14 and will be completed in five years. The contents of the plan are generally as follows:

### Increase Shipbuilding Funds to Promote National Maritime Policy

[Tokyo] The Ministry of Communications' national maritime policy is becoming increasingly important under the wartime system. Therefore, it has been decided to increase the current shipbuilding loan funds from 70 million yen to 150 million yen to help shipowners raise funds for shipbuilding. This funding will be included in next year's budget and is currently being negotiated with the Ministry of Finance and the Planning Board. (Domei Dispatch, 26th)

### Effective Date of Stamp Tax in This City During Emergency Period

Effective from October 26th; Stamps on books and ledgers valid until year-end

Since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the Provisional Measures for Collecting Stamp Tax During Emergency Period on October 11th of this year, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting that penalties be waived for any violations before the order was received. It is now learned that the Jiangsu Stamp Tax and Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau received an urgent telegram from the Ministry of Finance dated November stating: "Regarding Article 1 of the Regulations on the Effective Date of Laws promulgated by the National Government on December 23, 1932, it stipulates that 'For any law explicitly stating that it takes effect from the date of promulgation, it shall take effect in the capital from the date the law is published in the National Government Gazette or the date the order promulgating the law is due to reach the relevant responsible authorities; in the provinces and cities, it shall take effect from the date the Gazette publishing the law or the order promulgating the law is due to reach the highest responsible authority in the province or city.' The Ministry's order promulgating the Provisional Measures for Collecting Stamp Tax During Emergency Period on October 11th of this year should, in accordance with the aforementioned regulations, take effect from the date the deadline specified in the schedule of effective dates of laws for reaching the highest responsible authority. (For example, Jiangsu Province is specified as having a deadline of 15 days, so the aforementioned measures should take effect from October 26th.) For merchants and residents of various provinces and cities who have not complied with the provisional measures for documents issued from October 11th to the deadline specified in the schedule of effective dates of laws for their respective provinces or districts, all supervisors, inspectors, and investigators should waive penalties upon detection. If the order cannot reach a certain area due to unforeseen circumstances, it shall take effect from the day after the order arrives, in accordance with Article 4 of the Regulations on the Effective Date of Laws. Therefore, penalties should also be waived for merchants and residents who violate the provisional measures before the aforementioned order arrives. As for the validity of stamps affixed to books and ledgers, Article 10 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Stamp Tax Law stipulates that it should be up to the year-end closing of business. Therefore, for books and ledgers that have been stamped before the provisional measures take effect, there is no need to add additional stamps. In order to avoid misunderstandings during enforcement inspections, the schedule of effective dates of laws is hereby copied and sent by telegram, and you are instructed to inform all subordinates to comply accordingly." Signed, Ministry of Finance, Document Tax Six Stamp. (New Voice Press Note: According to the schedule of effective dates, Jiangsu Province is 15 days, but Shanghai Municipality is not specified. Therefore, the Jiangsu date can be used as a reference, and the Provisional Measures for Collecting Stamp Tax During Emergency Period will take effect from October 26th.)

### Sanitation Facilities in Refugee Camps

Generally Perfected; Refugees Lack Warm Clothing

The sanitation in the refugee camps in the Nanshi district has improved significantly since the International Relief Committee, together with various charitable organizations, launched a large-scale cleaning campaign. Currently, there are three temporary hospitals in the district, located at (1) Wanzhu Elementary School, (2) a residence on Houjiabang Road, and (3) the Circulation Library. There are also three maternity hospitals, located at (1) Deyilou, (2) Anren Street, and (3) the Sino-Belgian Recreation Center. All pregnant women are delivered at the various maternity hospitals, with over 100 births recorded. The number of patients is gradually decreasing, thanks to the tireless efforts of the Chinese Red Cross, the Chinese Medical Association, and the Catholic nuns. However, three-quarters of the refugees in the district still lack cotton-padded clothing and blankets. With the cold weather upon us, it is hoped that kind-hearted people will continuously donate, which would be a great merit.

### Fires Erupt Again in Caojing, Nanshi, and Pudong

Yesterday marked the second week since the fall of Nanshi, and the fire continued to burn. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter looked south from Laobeimen and witnessed the fire there, which intensified again yesterday. Judging by the direction, it was in the area of Zhaojia Road and Wenmiao Road, where the houses seemed to have been completely destroyed.

Since our army withdrew from the Caojing district in western Shanghai, the residents of the town fled, and the houses in the town remained largely untouched. However, starting a week later, fires broke out in various places every day, and the essence of the entire area was reduced to ashes. Yesterday, a villager who escaped from the area told people that there are no complete houses left in Laofenshan. On the east side, from Jinrong Bridge westward to Miao Bridge, seven out of ten houses along the upper and lower banks of the river have been destroyed. The west side is relatively safe. The surrounding villages have suffered even more severely. As a result, factories, gardens, education centers, prisons, and larger residential houses have been largely spared. None of the eight districts in the area have escaped damage.

There had been no fires in the Pudong district for several days. Unexpectedly, around noon yesterday, fires broke out simultaneously in two places: a building in the second row of Peide Lane on Yangjiazhai Tudi Temple Street and in the cluster of thatched sheds on the open space west of the Chen family residence in Dongyangjiazhai. The residents there had long since moved away, and few people were around, so the flames raged and no one extinguished them. After burning for about two hours, more than ten buildings in Peide Lane and more than thirty thatched sheds in the open space were destroyed.

### Floating Restaurant Sealed Off

Fu Sheng Ship Unable to Unload Cargo; Diverted to Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou

Since our army withdrew from this city, government agencies within the concessions have mostly closed down voluntarily to reduce difficulties for the concession authorities. The municipal ferry service has also been suspended due to the war in the Huangpu River. The ferry service was a local operation. Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, seven Japanese men went to the floating restaurant (i.e., the municipal ferry terminal) on the Bund outside Beijing Road. At the time, the Jardine Matheson's Fu Sheng ship was docked there. The Japanese men immediately notified the shipowner that the floating restaurant was the property of the Chinese government. As they spoke, they tied a Japanese flag to the floating restaurant's flagpole and sealed the iron gate, prohibiting passage, which prevented the ship from unloading its cargo. The shipowner, a Westerner, negotiated with the Japanese men, but they ignored him and left. The shipowner then reported the situation to the company, which reported it to the consulate for negotiations with the Japanese side. The ship then sailed to Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou at around 4:00 PM to dock. At that time, the Pinghe ship was diverted to the post office wharf on the south side.

### German Consul General Returns Home

The National Maritime News Agency reported from this city that there were rumors recently that the acting German Consul General in Shanghai, Bünder, was recalled to Germany due to dissatisfaction with the attitude taken by Japan on a certain local issue. It has now been learned that the semi-official German news agency has issued a denial, declaring that such rumors are completely unfounded. Bünder, due to poor health, requested permission from the government on November 13th to return home for medical treatment and to report on the situation in Shanghai. This request was only recently approved, and Mr. Bünder has now departed for Germany.

### American Families Return to Shanghai

The North China Daily News reported that since the war has shifted west, the British Consul General in Shanghai believes that Shanghai is now safe and that the British expatriates who evacuated previously can return. However, this does not mean that the situation in Shanghai has completely returned to normal, as certain parts of the International Settlement, such as the area north of the Suzhou Creek and the Hongqiao area, have not yet been opened. Yesterday, many Americans were eager to welcome the Conte Rosso ship, which arrived from Manila carrying their wives, daughters, and loved ones, so they did not even attend the football match at the Recreation Ground. It was confirmed that there were no dependents of Marines, Navy, or Consulate staff among the female passengers.

### Population of This City Gradually Decreasing

Difficult to Purchase Food; Hard to Make a Living

Recently, all ships from this city to the interior, whether to Nantong, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Min'gang, or the northern routes, are fully loaded with passengers, and even ship tickets must be obtained through intermediaries. There are approximately two reasons for this: (1) Grain panic. Although foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai, it is only a drop in the bucket and is insufficient. Most people still find it difficult to purchase rice, resulting in a situation where even those with money find it difficult to cook. Furthermore, the people of Nanshi are not accustomed to eating wheat, while the interior is experiencing bountiful harvests with abundant rice reserves, so many are leaving Shanghai. (2) The city's economy is depressed, and industry and commerce are in a state of prolonged stagnation, making it difficult to make a living. Due to these two reasons, wealthy families are going to Hong Kong or Manila, while families with moderate means are leaving Shanghai to return to their hometowns. As a result, the population of this city is gradually decreasing.

### International Medical Team Expected to Arrive in China Early Next Year

Third Team to Depart from Switzerland Next Month; Led by Famous Doctor Moussiaeff

Shin Shih News Agency reports that according to a source at a certain health agency, regarding the League of Nations' decision to allocate 2 million Swiss francs to assist China in epidemic prevention in response to our government's application, the organization will be divided into three teams, each with more than ten members, all equipped with sophisticated equipment and various medicines. The first team is led by Dr. Lortat, a bacteriologist from the Pasteur Institute in Nice, France. The second team is led by Dr. Lygre. The third team is led by Dr. Moussiaeff, a famous doctor from Zurich, Switzerland. The third team, led by Dr. Moussiaeff, is scheduled to depart from Switzerland on the 10th of next month and is expected to arrive in China early next year. The other two teams will also depart successively. After arriving in China, they will cooperate with our health agencies and go to various parts of the interior to carry out epidemic prevention work.

### Ye Yufu Leaves Shanghai to Raise Funds

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, refugees have flocked to various shelters, and resources are being exhausted to provide relief. The women's and children's shelter run by Mr. Ye Yufu and his colleagues has achieved remarkable results. Due to dwindling funds, Mr. Ye took the Dutch ship Zesarea to Hong Kong a few days ago, and then will head to the interior to raise funds and investigate methods for resettling refugees. Also, the Chinese Architectural Society, the Archaeological Society, and other organizations led by Mr. Ye are also planning to move to the interior.

### Pudong Inspection Record

Three Maintenance Societies Already Established, a Desolate Sight After the Yangjing Fire

Situation Crossing the Huangpu River

News from Pudong is conflicting and confusing. In order to understand the situation in the countryside, this reporter made a special effort to cross the Huangpu River for investigation. At six o'clock in the morning the day before yesterday (the 25th), I arrived at the Bund to wait for a boat. I saw the flags of British, French, Xu, and Italian trading houses on the wharves. The piers were located on the Bund, and two or three wharf boats were towed by a small steamer or boat. Each boat could carry thousands of passengers, with a fare of 30 cents per passenger. If carrying a load, a fee of 10 cents was required. The boatmen also wanted a "wine fee" of about 10 cents. The landing points in Pudong included the docks between the Blue Funnel Line and Asiatic Petroleum, where one could reach Yangjing and other places. To the north, one could land at Gao Temple and Gaoqiao. However, the western section was said to have restrictions.

Deployment of Puppet Police

This reporter landed at the Blue Funnel Line and exited through the company's side gate. At that time, the Japanese army was marching south, so I waited for about half an hour before proceeding. I encountered two Japanese officers along the way, but nothing unusual happened. I then encountered the recruited police patrolling there, led by Police Inspector Zhao Yunsheng. Zhao had previously served as a patrol chief and lived in Caonitang near the old ferry. The police wore uniforms; in previous days, they were made of yellow cloth, but now some wore black serge. They had no cap badges or armbands, only a yellow silk symbol on the edge of their pockets. They carried rattan batons and were reportedly treating the villagers well. Moreover, most of the recruited police were those who had been eliminated in the past. The police station there is still called the Shanghai Municipal Police Branch. The current branch chief is surnamed Zhou, but there are only 32 policemen, with a monthly salary of 24 yuan. The chairman of the Yangjing Maintenance Society is Gu Jinsheng, a local who runs a Gaoqiao Dim Sum shop in Yangjing East Town. Its name is the Autonomous Maintenance Society. Currently, Yangjing, being the northernmost first dock south of the Huangpu River, sees thousands of villagers entering and leaving daily. The area around the Blue Funnel Line is crowded with pedestrians like ants.

Sealing Vacant Houses

Behind the Blue Funnel Line, the Linjia Wooden Bridge has not a single damaged house and is now designated as a temporary market. It is quite lively in the morning. The local police station has posted a notice stating that all Pudong vegetables, etc., are now designated to be at Taikoo Dock No. 2 to meet mutual needs and must not be transported to Puxi. As a result, vegetable vendors and fresh goods are often blocked. However, the dates used are lunar calendar dates. For example, yesterday was written as "Dingchou Year, October 23rd." After walking about two *li*, I reached 49 Lane in the West Gate of Yangjing, where all the houses had been bombed. Further in, at the West Gate entrance, apart from five or six buildings at the edge of the market, the famous Songsheng Sauce Garden, with more than a hundred rooms on the west side of the bridge, was mostly destroyed. Both sides of the street, with restaurants, foreign cloth shops, foreign goods stores, etc., were all destroyed. On the east side of the bridge, dozens of houses were also destroyed. Up to the Maintenance Society, not a single house was intact. Some houses were not destroyed but were unoccupied, and they had been thoroughly looted. The police station immediately issued many seal strips and handed them over to the local Maintenance Society to distribute to the local *dibaos* (local headmen) for posting on each household. The strips read: "Unauthorized entry into this vacant house is prohibited and will be severely punished. If the owner returns, they should first register at the police station before entering." Anyone caught stealing more than three times will be arrested and handed over to the Japanese military headquarters for punishment.

Situation in Yangjing

Further east is the old headquarters of the local defense corps, which is now the police branch station. The previous Yangjing police station has been bombed. Yangjing is a major market town in Pudong, and about 80% of the houses have been destroyed. Currently, the population of Yangjing is about one thousand, and the scene is desolate. Turning southwest towards Qichang Wharf, there is a Japanese warship berthed beside the dock, and transportation is very busy these days. It is not easy to pass through. At the same time, Japanese soldiers are stationed on Xinma Road (Pudong Avenue). To avoid trouble, I walked inside the fields. Looking from afar, none of the houses within three *li* of the docks were intact, and few people lived there. Walking to Zhuangjiazhai and Xiaowujiazhai, a small number of villagers are now living there. Further west, I reached Xinma Road Bridge at the intersection of Dongchang Road. Lan Nidu (Rotten Mud Ferry) was right in front of me. Because it was not easy to pass through Xinma Road, I saw a cattle dealer leading two cows. This man, surnamed Zhang, is temporarily working as an interpreter for the Miyazaki Kempeitai headquarters. When asked about the situation at Lan Nidu, he said that the residence of Chen Tingzhang in Yangjiazhai is now the Kempeitai headquarters. Because there was no maintenance society to come forward and receive them, a major fire broke out, and more than half of the town was burned down. There are very few residents, and the area around the dock has been designated as a restricted zone. Ships sailing in the southern Huangpu section must have permission from the naval headquarters. As for the town of Lan Nidu, there is still no organization, but a police station has been established at the original site of the old Pudong Third District Police Station. The chief is surnamed Su, and there are more than one hundred policemen.

What I Heard at Tangqiao

Turning south, I arrived at Yangjiadu and Laobaidu, where the houses were undamaged, and an autonomous maintenance society had already been established. Its chairman is Wang Baokang, the owner of Wang Zengji Rice Store. The daily police patrols are sent by Lan Nidu and do not stand guard. The Japanese army does not station troops in areas with a maintenance society, only occasionally patrolling. Further south, I could not get through to Zhangjiabang and Tangqiao. I eventually met Wang Youqing of Tangqiao, who said that when the Japanese army arrived at Tangqiao, all the people in the town fled. Because he was old and had some property, he vowed to live and die with his house, so he did not leave. Now the Japanese army wants municipal committee members and *dibaos* to return to work. It is likely that a Tangqiao Maintenance Society will be established in the future.

Gaoqiao is Peaceful

Turning east to Beicai Town and other places, although they had been bombed before, the market was as prosperous as before. Turning south to Sanlintang and Yangsiqiao, the market was particularly developed. The maintainer there is surnamed Zhang. Currently, all the vegetables in Shanghai come from Sanlintang, selling for two yuan per load. There are still many rice boats in the Bailianjing Port. Further south from Sanlintang to Zhoupu Town, the chairman of the Maintenance Society is Gong Xiaodi. That place is also relatively peaceful. Because the journey was too far, I did not go. I stayed overnight at the Qi family's house and then returned to observe Gao Temple, Donggou, and Gaoqiao. Gaoqiao was the most peaceful. There was no Maintenance Society or police, but yesterday the Japanese army had posted a notice criticizing the people of Gaoqiao for being disorderly. Returning to the dock, I took the Yihua Company ferry. After waiting for three hours, no small steamer came to tow us, so I finally took a motorboat back to Shanghai.

### Exceptional Tranquility in the Four Rural Townships of Nanhui

The Local Defense Corps Maintains Order Effectively, and the Villagers Continue to Live and Work in Peace

The four rural townships of Nanhui in Pudong are far from Shanghai, and news has been blocked for half a month. People in Shanghai find it difficult to know the truth. Yesterday, a gentleman who had taken refuge in Datuan Town south of the county seat came to Shanghai via a roundabout route. According to him, the town is now protected by a Local Defense Corps composed of business circles, so bandits have disappeared, and the order is peaceful, just like before the war. Other towns such as Xinxiang, Hangtou, Xiahe, Shenzhuang, Zhuqiao, Hengmian, and Li灶 are in the same situation as Datuan. The members of the Local Defense Corps are loyal to their duties and take turns guarding day and night, allowing the local people to farm in the fields and merchants to trade in the market, and they can still live and work in peace. At the southern border, several scattered soldiers were found in Situan Town a few days ago. Thanks to the self-defense efforts of the Local Defense Corps members, they were disarmed and sent away, and the town was able to maintain its safety. He also said that when they passed through Zhoupu Town, the market was prosperous, and members of the Local Defense Corps were stationed around the area, conducting strict inspections, and the ground was also very quiet. In Yujiaqiao to the north, the local Local Defense Corps also maintains order on its own, and there is nothing unusual. At this time, the most effective and safest way is for the people to defend themselves.

### Tobacco and Cigarette Industry Pays More Than 60,000 Yuan in National Bonds

The Fushuntang Shelter, run by the Qingjing Fushuntang in the refugee area of Nanshi, has established a general office and branch offices 1-7 in order. Registered over 10,000 refugees in the neighborhoods, with good results and good order. In addition to the 18,000 Guangbing and Mantou given by the International Relief Committee every day, more than 10,000 refugees received rations every day, two meals per day, four pieces per person, thanks to the enthusiastic donations from the Red Swastika Society and various philanthropists. More than sixty refugee monks who escaped from the Haichao Temple are devoutly chanting Buddhist scriptures to save themselves from adversity. Father Rao designated Lin Sen to handle the seventh district office, located on Dajing Road, east to Jiucang Street, west to Xiaobeimen, south to Fangbang Road, and north to Minguo Road, and dispatched 30 cleaners to be responsible for cleaning work.

### Zhang Lingfei's Son Moves His Wedding Ceremony to Support Education

In view of the serious national crisis, he simplified all kinds of ceremonies and donated 100 yuan of congratulatory gifts from relatives and friends to the education group of the Chinese Red Cross Society Shanghai International Relief Committee to fund the education of refugee children in this city.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Prospects for Anglo-French Talks

— Yi

After the stalemate at the Brussels Conference, British diplomatic activities became the focus of worldwide attention. British Prime Minister Halifax previously held a secret meeting with German leader Hitler. Recently, the British government invited French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet to London to hold important consultations on international political and economic issues. These diplomatic activities seem to be only related to European issues on the surface. In fact, in this era of very tense global situation, European security and Far Eastern security are just two sides of the same coin. If the situation in Europe improves due to the temporary coordination of the Anglo-Franco-German triangular relationship, then the Far East issue will naturally be easier to resolve.

The most prominent destabilizing factor in Europe is currently the Spanish question. During the Spanish Civil War, it was obvious that Italy and Germany supported Franco, and the Soviet Union supported the Republican government. The British government has always been in a dilemma. It feels that if the Spanish Republican government wins, it will inevitably lean towards communism, affecting British investment in Spain. Conversely, if Franco wins, Germany and Italy will use Spain and its dependencies' strategic military locations to build naval bases, which would be enough to threaten the British Empire's control of sea lanes. Therefore, the British government advocated a non-intervention policy, allowing the natural resolution of the Spanish Civil War. However, the non-intervention policy has not been very effective, and the continuation of the Spanish Civil War has made the European crisis even more serious.

According to foreign media reports, the Anglo-German talks a few days ago and the upcoming Anglo-French talks are aimed at resolving the Spanish issue as soon as possible. Obviously, the British government wants to mediate the Spanish Civil War after obtaining Hitler's understanding. This is the intention that Prime Minister Chamberlain had when he came to power. However, the two sides in the Spanish Civil War have long been irreconcilable. It is still very difficult to mediate. Let's wait and see the skills of the politician.

### Intense Fighting Near Jiangyin, Yangtze River Freight Disrupted

MV Endeavor Returns with Cargo, Shanghai-Tongzhou Line Still Operable

Heavy artillery fire and intense bombing in Jiangyin have fundamentally blocked traffic on the river. Originally, Yangtze River goods from Shanghai could be transported to Tongzhou by various foreign merchant ships such as Taikoo, Jardine, and Wah Yick, and then transferred by barges across the Yangtze River through Jiangyin, and then transferred to boats in Zhenjiang, charging a water fee of 42 yuan per ton. However, in recent days, the situation has changed drastically. Ships from Shanghai to Tongzhou can still barely pass, but the goods shipped from Shanghai to the Yangtze River cannot be transferred by barges of various foreign shipping companies in Zhenjiang because Jiangyin has been blocked, and those in Tongzhou cannot go upstream. Yangtze River traffic has been completely blocked, so the Yangtze River goods shipped from Shanghai in recent days, which were originally scheduled to be transferred to barges in Tongzhou, could not be unloaded into barges after arriving in Tongzhou, let alone be transferred across Jiangyin. The Wah Yick company's MV Endeavor, which went from Shanghai to Tongzhou the day before yesterday with 800 tons of Yangtze River goods, could not be unloaded and transferred after arriving in Tongzhou, and had to bring the returned goods back to Shanghai in the original ship. The ship arrived in Shanghai at 4:30 p.m. yesterday. However, because the Shanghai-Tongzhou route is still passable, passengers can still disembark in Tongzhou, so the ship's passenger seats were sold out the day before. The ship also departed as usual at 7 a.m. this morning, but it refused to load cargo. All the return cargo carried by the original ship, due to the short time, could not be unloaded and can only be temporarily used as ballast.

### Portuguese Merchants Buy Small Steamers to Restore Inland Water Routes

Small Steamers on the Suzhou Creek Have Been Re-flagged with the Portuguese Flag, and Navigation Schedules and Routes are Currently Being Negotiated with Various Parties

The inland waterway shipping companies include Lao Gongmao, Taichang, Lixing, Yuantong, Ningshao, Xie Xing, and Dajiangnan, with routes such as Shenhu, Shenhang, Shensu, and Shenxi. Since our army retreated to the safety zone city, land traffic in Shanghai has been cut off, and water traffic relies on foreign ships for maintenance. Inland small steamers have completely stopped sailing. There are about fifty small steamers and tugboats parked in the Suzhou Creek area. Portuguese merchants have organized the Deqi Inland River Shipping Company, located at 612 North Suzhou Road, the former site of the Shenhu Public Bureau, planning to operate inland small steamers, mainly for loading cargo and passengers. They have successfully negotiated the purchase of small steamers and tugboats parked in the Suzhou Creek. Starting yesterday, all the parked ships have been re-flagged with the Portuguese flag. As for the date of sailing and the routes, they are currently being negotiated with various parties. It is heard that the Shanghai-Qingpu and Shanghai-Pudong lines will be opened first.

### Investigation of Damage to Factories

### Local Goods Stores Procure Vegetables

Prices Gradually Fall, Fresh Fish Cannot Be Shipped to Shanghai

After the Shanghai Local Goods Industry Association made every effort to dredge the source of vegetables and regulate the food supply in Shanghai, members' local goods stores have directly procured from Gaoqiao in Pudong, Nantong, and Tianshenggang, loaded them onto ships, and transported them to Shanghai, and the market prices have gradually fallen. The details are recorded as follows:

Direct Procurement

After traffic in Shanghai was blocked and the source of vegetables was cut off, the Local Goods Industry Association obtained the cooperation of the Public Concession and planned to charter ships to run on the Shanghai-Tongzhou line to transport vegetables. However, because the charter fee would be at least 1,800 yuan each time, and it was difficult to calculate the cost for sale, the project was suspended. Instead, the member local goods stores directly tried to procure from Gaoqiao in Pudong, Nantong, and Tianshenggang.

Resumption of Business by Various Stores

Now the local goods stores have all implemented procurement from the above two places. Vegetables from Tianshenggang are loaded onto ships on the Shanghai-Tongzhou line and transported to Shanghai. Eighteen pieces arrived yesterday. Laborers transport vegetables from Gaoqiao to Shanghai by ferry, and a large batch arrives every day. At the same time, each ship on the Shanghai-Tianjin line brings a large amount of Jiaocai vegetables to Shanghai. Therefore, the business of local goods stores in the Laozha and Shiliupu areas has been fully restored. The Touba local goods stores north of the Suzhou Creek have moved to the Laozha area for business, but the local goods stores in the Xinzha and Caojiadu areas have not yet resumed business.

Price Drop

After the source of vegetables was dredged, the prices of various vegetables in small markets have gradually fallen. Pudong cabbage and Shandong Jiaocai vegetables cost about 10 cents per catty, spinach and golden flower vegetables cost about 15 cents per catty, and celery and yellow soybean sprouts cost about 5 cents per catty. The above prices are the general situation, but there are also many cases where vendors raise prices or lower prices due to an urgent desire to sell goods. The chaotic situation is still inevitable. However, preserved vegetables are extremely rare, and even if they exist, the price is surprisingly high. Because the source of foreign potatoes is cut off, there are no goods for sale on the market. Also, according to reports, the supply of food in this port is still not smooth. According to the results of a recent inspection of the vegetable market by the Datong News Agency reporter, meat and eggs are the most sold, while vegetables and other foods are very few. Therefore, the market situation is quite desolate and full of a bleak scene. In terms of market prices, pork has not changed, and two catties can be purchased for one yuan in national currency. Cabbage costs 30 copper coins per catty, duck eggs cost 9 copper coins per piece, and the prices of other foods are similar to yesterday's. It is heard that there are still many obstacles to the transportation of vegetables from Pudong. Three to four hundred loads of vegetables were intercepted and dumped in the Xin Sanjing Wharf in the past two days. The Japanese army arrived at the Pudong ferry crossing yesterday and posted a notice, stating in slightly that it was found that the various vegetable vendors were extremely poor. Now, in order to take care of their livelihoods, a vegetable market has been set up in the Xin Sanjing Wharf for business, but vegetable vendors are absolutely not allowed to pick vegetables to Shanghai. If the above situation is found again in the future, it will be confiscated together.

Fresh Fish is Exhausted

Most of the river fish in Shanghai rely on the supply of Linghu near Wuxing. Every year in winter, the quantity and value of Linghu pond fish transported to Shanghai for sale are more than 400,000 yuan. In previous years, during this period, fish merchants hired inland small steamers to be used exclusively for transportation. However, this winter, due to the war, traffic between Shanghai and Linghu has been cut off, and it is impossible to transport these fresh fish to Shanghai for sale. Even if there is a small amount of supply, it is regarded as a forbidden object and sold before it enters the market. Therefore, it is difficult to see fresh fish in the vegetable market, and the residents of Shanghai sigh that they have food but no fish.

### Sacrifice Life to Buy Rice

Falling from the Balcony, Die After Hitting the Ground

Wang Dingfu, a native of Suzhou, 28 years old, used to be an employee of the Caojiadu Postal Branch. Yesterday afternoon at about 1 p.m., he went out from the branch to buy rice at a rice store next door. Seeing that there were an unusually large crowd of rice buyers, Wang Dingfu returned to the branch and climbed into the rice store from the balcony on the second floor of the branch to buy rice. Because he accidentally lost his footing, he fell headfirst from above, suffering extremely serious head injuries. Later, he was spotted by a nearby Chinese police officer, who drove him to Renji Hospital for treatment. Because the injuries were too severe, he died before he could be treated.

### Various Clan Associations Seeking News of Hometowns

Since Kunshan fell into the war zone, news has been cut off. Fellow villagers in Shanghai, wishing to know the real news about their hometown of Kunshan city and the towns of Chenmu, Jiaozhi, Zhangpu, Anting, Bacheng, and Qiandun, are requesting that anyone who has traveled to Shanghai or knows the current situation of their hometown provide a written or telephone report. This will be relayed to other fellow villagers. Contact Mr. Gu Yulin at No. 10 Yongnian Lane, Baike Road, in the Yin Medical Office. The telephone number is 33333.

Fellow villagers from Xintai Town, Pinghu County, in Shanghai are also requesting that if any fellow villagers have recently come to Shanghai or know the current situation of their homes, please notify Mr. Xu Mojue at the Siemens Bed Factory, No. 65 Aiduya Road, or report by telephone at 90760. This will be relayed to fellow villagers in Shanghai.

Shengze and Wangjiangjing are two adjacent towns, the origin of silk production. A large number of fellow villagers are engaged in business in Shanghai. Since the Suzhou-Jiading railway line was breached, fierce fighting has lasted for over a week. Subsequently, news has been cut off, and it is impossible to find out. It is hoped that fellow villagers who have taken refuge in Shanghai or received letters or other news will inform Chen Jianshi at No. 45 Zhizhong Road, so that the information can be relayed to fellow villagers.

People from Wuzhen in Shanghai hope that anyone who has fled to Shanghai from the Wuzhen area can contact Shen Weijia by telephone at 76543.

### Statistics of Refugees

According to a report from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department, on the 25th of this month, there were 149 refugee shelters inspected by the department, accommodating a total of 89,431 refugees.

### Refugees Freezing to Death Daily, Urgently Awaiting Donations of Clothing and Bedding

Generous Donations from All Sectors Alleviate Concerns;  Pushan Mountain Villa Soliciting Funds for Coffins

Recently, the weather in the city has suddenly turned severely cold. The number of refugees freezing to death in various shelters and along the streets is increasing daily. Especially in the refugee areas of the Nanshi district, a shocking number of refugees and displaced children are dying as a result – dozens each day. According to a reporter's investigation, the bodies buried by Pushan Mountain Villa and those inspected by the court's procuratorate after police reports are mostly of this type. The situation is clearly very serious. Therefore, all relief organizations earnestly hope that warm-hearted people from all walks of life will generously donate clothing and bedding and provide swift relief.

Large Amount of Supplies, Soliciting Donations

Since the International Relief Committee launched the "One Dime a Day" donation campaign to help refugees, there has been an enthusiastic response from all sectors. Yesterday, the committee received additional donations from the staff of the China Industrial Bank (51.5 yuan), the China Tianyi Insurance Company (18 yuan), the Tong Mao Zhan group (100 yuan), the Xie Shengchang group (63 yuan), and dozens of others, including Shen Xiaocen, Bu Yinshi, the Zhou residence on Avenue Joffre, Tang Huagen, Hong Weiguan, Chen Wenlong, Qian Xinmao, Zheng Longwen, and Lu Zongxian. However, the five shelters established by the committee house more than 25,000 people. There are currently over 100,000 refugees in the Nanshi refugee area, plus poor families in the area who are gradually running out of food. The supplies needed are enormous, and all funds have been exhausted. Donations are urgently needed. Please send them to the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge.

Furthermore, the committee reports that due to the sudden cold weather, after urgently distributing 1,500 quilts and over 2,000 cotton-padded coats, it distributed another 3,000 cotton-padded coats yesterday. Since there are a total of more than 25,000 refugees in the five shelters, more donations from enthusiastic men and women are needed to help the displaced and prevent them from freezing or starving. According to the committee, since the establishment of the refugee area, its burden, calculated at one dime per person per day, requires 12,500 yuan: 2,500 yuan for the five shelters and 10,000 yuan for the 100,000 refugees in the refugee area. If we add the residents of the area who are gradually running out of food, the number increases daily, which is to be expected. Funds have now been exhausted and urgently need to be raised. In addition to doing its best, the committee has Mr. Wu Yunzhai and Mr. Lin Kanghou running around appealing to all sectors.

Furthermore, a certain inspector from the United Charitable Organizations made an earnest appeal to reporters yesterday, saying that recently, due to the shortage of rice, they have been eating more noodles and steamed buns. However, due to the lack of salt, they are mostly eating bland food. As a result, many refugees are sick. It is urgently hoped that all sectors will immediately donate salt so that more than 100,000 displaced people can avoid various diseases. The merit is immeasurable.

Pushan Mountain Villa's Urgent Appeal

Pushan Mountain Villa in the city has always relied on continuous support from all sectors to carry out its charitable burial work. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the burial work has become increasingly heavy. To date, it has buried as many as 17,670 bodies, large and small. Recently, it has also undertaken burial work in the Nanshi refugee area. Now in the severe winter, after the war, many will surely freeze to death. The remaining coffins are few in number. The association is appealing to all sectors, hoping that kind gentlemen and ladies will generously donate money or coffins. All are welcome, so that the exposed may be blessed, and the merit is immeasurable.

Guangyu Society Members Broadcasting Appeals for Donations

All members of the Guangyu Society remaining in Shanghai, due to the difficulty in providing food for the hundreds of thousands of refugees in Shanghai, have invited the chairman, Huang Zhaolin, etc., to gather all members and broadcast special programs on the Oriental Radio Station every day from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM, doing their best to solicit clothes, food, money, etc., from people in all charitable circles, and handling donations. Those who wish to donate generously, please send them directly to the Refugee Relief Association, the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge, the Second Refugee Relief Center on Luzon Road, or the Chinese Red Cross, etc.

Municipal Relief Association's Health Work

The Municipal Relief Association's Epidemic Prevention Division, in view of the fact that many children in the shelters are malnourished, has Dr. Qi Dazhi of the division soliciting donations from certain philanthropists to distribute soy milk to children in the shelters twice a day, about half a pound per person each time. This has been going on for nearly two weeks. Recently, the division discovered that refugees are gathering in one place all day long, resulting in lice infestations, which are detrimental to the health of the refugees. Therefore, it organized a lice-catching team. The method is to first spray the clothes with medicine using a pressurized spray can, and then dry the clothes with an iron. The team has already been working at various shelters since the day before yesterday under the leadership of Inspector Zhang of the Health Division. Therefore, the refugees in the shelters are praising them in unison.

### Sudden Cold Weather, Citizens Take Precautions Against Disease

Cholera Discovered; Refugees Actually Freezing to Death

Since the beginning of this winter, the climate has been unusually warm, dry, and fiery. Therefore, many people suffered from diphtheria half a month ago. Unexpectedly, since the day before yesterday, the weather has suddenly changed, becoming unbearably cold, resulting in the recent discovery of cholera epidemics in the Xujiahui area. Patients first feel headaches and stomach pains, followed by vomiting and diarrhea. Even the slightest carelessness and delay in treatment can be fatal, especially to children in crowded poor areas. Special attention should be paid. Furthermore, refugees in Caoxi Road, Shanghai West, are now living in the Guangfu and Jishan temples and Yan Hai Elementary School in the refugee area. Recently, due to the sudden cold weather, the number of refugees suffering from freezing diseases is increasing daily. In recent days, women such as Zhang Ma and two or three children have died one after another. It is hoped that philanthropists will donate old clothes and quilts to save the displaced people.

### American Missionaries Arriving in Shanghai One After Another

The Da Mei Evening News reported that yesterday, a total of 22 American missionaries and their families from the war zone arrived here from Ningbo on an Italian ship. They all came from Ningbo, Mogan Mountain, and other inland areas. It is said that another batch will arrive here from Ningbo in a few days. Five missionaries in Guangfu Town near Suzhou have not been heard from to this day. There are also two or three people in Jiangyin. Over the past few days, the area has been fiercely attacked by the Japanese army. Missionaries who used to reside in various parts of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui have gradually withdrawn from the war zone and transferred to Shanghai, where they will stay temporarily. Once the situation permits, they will continue their work.

### Changshu Rice Confiscation Case, Telegraphic Request to Retain Punishment

In the case of the Changshu County Government confiscating twelve rice boats, including those of Bei Jinda, Lu Muqin, a representative of the People's Food Association, had repeatedly negotiated with Changshu and petitioned the province. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce also telegraphed the provincial government, requesting that the county be ordered to release the boats. Unexpectedly, Changshu unfortunately became a war zone again while the case was being thoroughly investigated, which prevented it from being concluded. The Changshu Rice Industry Association, the Grain Dealers Association, and the Shanghai North Rice Transporters United Association, in order to maintain the interests of legitimate merchants, jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it be submitted to the central government to reserve the decision on the case. The original letter is as follows: To the honored ones, regarding the case of the Changshu County Government illegally confiscating the twelve rice boats of Bei Jinda et al., after our associations jointly requested assistance, your esteemed chamber reasonably telegraphed the Executive Yuan on October 11, requesting that the Jiangsu Provincial Government be ordered to investigate and return the boats. More than a month has passed, and there has been no reply. Unexpectedly, Changshu became a war zone again before the disposition of the case, and unfortunately, around November 20, it was rumored to have fallen into enemy hands. The matter is extraordinary and irreversible. However, looking forward to Qin Yu, the date of recovery must not be far off. Considering the interests of the ship owners and merchants, our associations have specially written to request your esteemed chamber to telegraph the central government again to reserve the right to dispose of the case of the Changshu County Government confiscating the rice boats, so that when the lost land is recovered and the light of day is restored, no matter how the administrative officials of the county change, they should continue to be responsible for handling the case and returning all the rice. If the rice has already been confiscated and changed hands, the county should be ordered to return the value of the rice to the original owner. If it has been appropriated for other uses, the county should also be ordered to compensate at the price. Furthermore, before the war affected the county, the county government had deposited part of the confiscated rice money in the Changshu branch of the Farmers Bank, estimated at more than 9,000 national currency. We request that your esteemed chamber telegraph the central government to approve the prior return to the original owner, in order to alleviate the hardships of merchants and the suffering of the people. We are deeply grateful, etc.

### Fourth Batch of Foreign Rice Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow, Foreign Merchants Continue to Order

Rice Shops Improve Retail Methods; 35,000 Bags for Refugee Use; Concession Authorities Decide to Continue Assisting Civilian Food Supply

After the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the China South Rice Industry Company cooperated to purchase foreign rice and transport it to Shanghai to regulate the civilian food supply, the first two or three batches have been unloaded. The Rice Shop Trade Association members are handling the retail. The fourth batch, loaded on the Zhejiang, is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. The French firm Da Fu Foreign Company has ordered more rice from Saigon. Details are recorded below.

Arriving in Batches

The first batch of 25,000 bags, carried by the Taikoo Company's Jiaying, arrived in Shanghai on the 22nd, and the Rice Industry Association is still continuing to handle the delivery procedures at the wharf. The second batch of 30,000 bags, carried by the Jardine Matheson's Fusheng, arrived in Shanghai on the 24th and the goods were unloaded into warehouses. The third batch of 30,000 bags, transported by a German ship, arrived on the 25th and is also being unloaded and stored. There is also a fourth batch of 30,000 bags, carried by the Taikoo Company's Zhejiang, which will arrive on the evening of the 27th and can sail into the Bund outside French Avenue on the 28th. All the above batches of foreign rice are from Saigon, totaling 115,000 bags.

Allocated to Rice Shops

Those taken by the Rice Shop Trade Association and handed over to member rice shops to handle retail are also in four batches, each batch of 20,000 bags, allocated to 500 member rice shops, 40 bags per shop per batch, for a total of 160 bags. A total of 35,000 bags are used by refugee relief agencies for refugee relief. The above-mentioned foreign rice is sold at a fair price, and all the money earned is used for refugee relief, managed by charitable organizations such as the Disaster Relief Association and the Chinese Red Cross.

Improving Retail Sales

Because the buyers are too crowded at the retail sales handled by the member rice shops of the Rice Shop Trade Association, it has been decided to improve the method. Police will be dispatched to issue numbers according to the order of the rice buyers and sell them in order, avoiding those with less strength being left behind. A notice posted at the door of the rice shop reads: "In order to urgently supply civilian food and provide universal fair prices, the following two retail methods are stipulated: ㊀ Each household is limited to a maximum purchase of one yuan in national currency. ㊁ The price per market catty is set at 8.5 cents in national currency."

Zhuang Ping, chairman of the Shanghai West United Association, went to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession at 10:00 AM yesterday to meet with Deputy Director He De Kui to improve the rice shop retail methods and curb high sales prices. Zhang Nianxuan, chairman of the Rice Shop Trade Association, also visited at the same time for this issue. Both were received by Deputy Director He. After stating their intentions, He De Kui immediately expressed that the Municipal Council is willing to cooperate with all responsible groups to handle the issue of adjusting the civilian food supply and hopes that the West United Association will unite with the Rice Shop Trade Association to take joint action. The Municipal Council will provide assistance in promoting and advancing. The Municipal Council has also noticed the poor retail methods and the chaotic situation in front of the rice shops and is considering ways to correct them. If all sectors have better methods to contribute, they will naturally be adopted and implemented. The Bureau has put a lot of effort into coordinating the civilian food supply. In the future, large batches will arrive continuously, so there is no need to panic. According to the prescribed price, each stone is about 13.6 yuan, absolutely not exceeding 14 yuan. If there is any hoarding or raising of prices, all sectors are allowed to report and accuse. The Municipal Council will severely crack down and punish them as a warning.

Association Collects Rice

The Rice Shop Trade Association has issued a notice to registered and qualified member rice shops to handle the payment and delivery of the third and fourth batches, following the same procedures as the first and second batches. As for the second batch of foreign rice piled up in the Bank of China warehouse, the association prepared trucks yesterday to collect it and allocated it to the rice shops in order for retail sales. However, because it is delivered from the warehouse, the cost per bag is increased by another 30 cents.

Foreign Factories Order

Yesterday, it was learned from the French firm Da Fu Foreign Company that many people have entrusted the foreign firm to continue ordering foreign rice from Saigon. Several hundred tons have already been successfully loaded and shipped to Shanghai. In addition, there are foreign factories entrusting orders to maintain the food supply for workers in the factory. There are also several cases of food merchants directly ordering foreign rice from abroad and transporting it to Shanghai to regulate the civilian food supply.

Allocated to Refugees

The food for the various shelters in the French Concession, after the French Municipal Council took out 800 bags from the first two batches of foreign rice and handed them over to the International Relief Committee for distribution, was collected by the various shelters one after another on the previous two days. The third batch of foreign rice has already arrived in Shanghai. The committee received a notice from the French Municipal Council yesterday to continue to take 800 bags to provide food for the various shelters in the concession. It is hoped that the various shelters will be notified to collect them accordingly.

The Da Mei Evening News reported that the 30,000 refugees in the Nanshi Safety Zone have been filling their stomachs with bread and biscuits for the past few days due to the lack of rice. It is learned that Father Jacquinot, who initiated this safe area, has obtained 1,600 bags of white rice recently shipped from Saigon. At the same time, the International Relief Committee of this port has also obtained enough fuel for cooking.

### Main Culprit in Homicide Arrested

Victim's Da Zhong Timber Firm Has Moved; Tang Jiusong Detained Pending Investigation and Further Interrogation

On April 4 of this year, at 3:50 AM, the Da Zhong Timber Firm at No. 457 Tokyo Road was suddenly broken into by four robbers, each carrying firearms (commonly known as "soft entry and hard exit"). Making threatening noises, they were about to rob when the shop owner Yu Yongchun was awakened from his sleep and shouted to catch the thieves. Seeing the situation was not good, the robbers had no time to search and immediately drew their pistols and fired several shots, hitting Yu in a vital spot and killing him on the spot. The gang also fled through the door. Afterwards, the police arrested one of the perpetrators, Du Liangdong, and sentenced him to four years in prison. Du also confessed that the main culprit, Tang Jiusong from Taizhou, had escaped to the Taiyang Temple in Zhabei. Although the police went to arrest him, Tang climbed over the roof and tried to escape. The detectives fired more than ten shots, but Tang still managed to escape. Therefore, the Special Court issued an arrest warrant. It was not until 1:30 PM the day before yesterday that Li Wenzhao, a Chinese detective from the Chengdu Road Police Station, arrested Tang Jiusong at the Xiaocai Market on Da Tong Road and brought him to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Special Court No. 1. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu requested a postponement, stating that the victim's Da Zhong Timber Firm has now moved and its whereabouts are unknown, and the police are investigating. After briefly interrogating Tang Jiusong, the presiding judge ordered him to be detained pending a further interrogation at a later date.

### After the Customs Ships Were Towed Away, Police Officers Could Not Be Properly Placed

Customs Is Considering Aftermath Measures

After the ships belonging to the Jianghai Customs were towed away, there is still no result. The tax police and patrolmen belonging to the various ships total no less than 800 people. Their placement is currently quite problematic. Some of them have now been transferred by the customs to patrol along the wharves on the Pujiang River in the concessions to seize smuggled goods or transferred to internal work. Most of them currently have no work to do. Both Chinese and Western officers are affected. The Customs is considering the aftermath measures.
