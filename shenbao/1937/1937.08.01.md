### Japanese Troops Invade Liulihe Station

After being repelled, Japanese reinforcements arrive and a standoff ensues.  Heavy shelling also occurs in the densely populated areas of Tianjin General Station and East Station.  High-ranking officials in Nanjing express extreme indignation at the atrocities of the Japanese army. The current calm is the temporary tranquility before the storm.

[Baoding] On the night of the 30th, while a certain brigade of the 29th Army was moving, Japanese troops seized the opportunity to invade Liulihe Railway Station. After being repelled by a newly arrived unit, Japanese reinforcements arrived, and a standoff is currently underway. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)

[Nanjing] The Japanese army's continuous bombing of Tianjin is extremely brutal. Powerful figures here unanimously believe that this situation is sufficient to strengthen China's determination to resist Japan.  Currently, telegrams are pouring in to the central government from all parts of the country, vowing to defend to the death Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek's declaration that "once the war has begun, there is no room for compromise." This agency's reporter interviewed several high-ranking officials on the morning of the 31st, all of whom believed that the silence of the past 24 hours was like the temporary tranquility before the storm.  They repeatedly reiterated their passionate support for Commander-in-Chief Chiang's statement that "we can only launch a comprehensive plan to lead the whole country in a united struggle, and sacrifice to the utmost to defend the nation."  This morning, newspapers expressed extreme indignation at the Japanese army's bestial conduct in Tianjin, unanimously condemning the Japanese army's wanton destruction of cultural institutions, and especially denouncing the use of kerosene to burn Nankai University and neighboring villages.  Furthermore, the Japanese army's shooting of residents is utterly inhumane.  According to a report from neutral sources in Peiping, seven corpses of civilians were found in the suburbs of Peiping, all with their hands tied behind their backs, and the heads of two of them had been chopped off, clearly the work of the Japanese.  Other cruel acts are too numerous to mention.  Even the elderly, weak, women, and children are not spared.  Moreover, the bombing of Tianjin by aircraft was carried out without any warning to the local residents. Their cruelty and bloodthirstiness are particularly intolerable under international law.  Regarding what the enemy has claimed, that they have established so-called "local public order maintenance committees" in Peiping and Tianjin, our government unanimously believes that this is a trick of the Japanese side, a cover for Japanese military rule.  A certain important person said that the experience of the past in the Four Eastern Provinces and eastern Hebei has made the world deeply aware that this is a habitual trick of the Japanese. When Japanese military forces arrive in a certain place, they often threaten and entice local people to organize puppet organizations, while they themselves remain behind the scenes pulling the strings. In reality, as soon as the Japanese army withdraws, these puppet organizations immediately collapse.  The Japanese side is now planning to restage this ugly farce in Peiping and Tianjin. They may consider themselves clever, but people around the world have long been disgusted by it." (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)

[Tianjin] Although Japanese troops are still engaged in battles with small units of Chinese soldiers in various places, the overall situation in northern Hebei has become relatively quiet. Tianjin has been completely occupied by the Japanese army. A Public Order Maintenance Committee has been formed in Peiping. After being heavily bombarded by Japanese artillery yesterday, the barracks at Xiyuan are now occupied by 2,000 Japanese soldiers. At the same time, Tianjin Acting Mayor Li Wentian notified the consular corps, stating that the security forces had completely withdrawn and requesting assistance in restoring normalcy in Tianjin. Everything is quiet in Tanggu. It is reported that Chinese troops have also withdrawn from Dagu, and ships can now enter and leave as usual. Yesterday, the security forces followed orders to return their weapons to the military depots. Those in the former Austrian concession abandoned their uniforms and fled. Another 300 members of the security forces marched in formation from the Third District and retreated south. Yesterday, a certain foreigner saw eleven corpses of Chinese police and seven corpses of civilians in the fields near the Yenching University campus in Nanhaitian. Their hands were all tied behind their backs, and several of them had been shot. Most had been hacked to death with knives. Two of the civilians had been decapitated. According to members of the Tongxian security forces encountered east of Peiping, in yesterday's battle in Tongxian, all the Japanese troops stationed there were wiped out. The security forces were forced to retreat due to the activity of Japanese aircraft, but many are now returning, it is said. According to Japanese sources, a column of Japanese mechanized troops, together with cavalry, fought the Tongxian security forces between Peiping and Tongxian yesterday. The Japanese troops used machine guns to disperse several hundred members of the security forces. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 31st)

[Tianjin] Last night, all the concessions here set up barriers at their entry points. There were no pedestrians on the roads, and it was quite quiet. But this morning, the Japanese army continued its mopping-up operations. At 4:30 AM, troops commanded by Akagi engaged in expelling Chinese soldiers from around a certain Japanese-owned yarn factory near the General Station. In the afternoon, Japanese troops resumed shelling the security forces in the densely populated area between the General Station and the East Station. Heavy rain fell, preventing Japanese aircraft from operating, but in the evening, two Japanese aircraft flew over Tianjin. Raids occurred frequently in various places. The main road from the Japanese concession to the General Station, including an important bridge, is now under Japanese control. The Japanese have now completed the systematic occupation of Tianjin and its special zones, with only the former German concession not yet occupied. A Peace Maintenance Committee is currently being organized. According to Japanese authorities, a certain foreigner's warehouse between the East Station and the Italian concession, and a certain building in the former Austrian concession, are still occupied by a large number of security forces. The Japanese side plans to bomb them, but the rain has prevented them from doing so. Today, all the concessions are implementing strict security measures, making it extremely difficult to travel between them. All the concessions are currently facing the problem of refugee congestion. Villagers in groups are now crowding the road between the racecourse and the British concession, and people from villages near the East Station are still constantly passing through the British concession along the riverbank to go elsewhere. Post office personnel resumed work this morning. Nankai University has been reduced to rubble, and the fire is still not extinguished this morning. Tanggu is quiet, Chinese troops have withdrawn from Dagu, and navigation has resumed as usual. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 31st)

### Baoding Military Vehicles Bombed

[Baoding] (Delayed dispatch) Enemy aircraft came three times this morning after 7:00 AM, each time only one plane, reconnoitering and then leaving. At 1:30 PM, seven planes came again, in formation. After circling over the provincial capital, they flew to the Xiguan Railway Station and dropped ten bombs, and strafed Xiguan Street with machine guns, destroying four military vehicles parked at the south end of the station. Bullets exploded at the same time, injuring and killing more than ten soldiers. They also dropped bombs on Train No. 41 heading south on the Pinghan Railway, killing and injuring more than 40 passengers. Several pedestrians on Xiguan Street were also shot dead by machine guns. The remaining fire from the bullets has not been completely extinguished, and the true situation is still under investigation. The security police and military in the city and suburbs have temporarily stepped up security precautions, and order is as usual. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)

### Japanese Troops Shell Hebei

[Nanjing] According to reports from relevant sources, at 2:30 PM on the 31st, Japanese troops again shelled areas outside the Hebei Railway and Dongjuzi, etc., for dozens of rounds without stopping, causing many civilian casualties and destroying many civilian houses. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)

### Hankou Japanese Concession Prepares for War

[Hankou] The Hankou Japanese Concession security conference resolved to form a situational committee, with Consul Matsudaira as chairman. They also formed a civilian police force and an intelligence team, and actively purchased military supplies, preparing for war. The Japanese cruiser "Kurishima" also brought 130 marines to Hankou. The Japanese Nisshin Steamship Company was ordered to close its business, dismiss Chinese staff, and have Japanese staff return to their country. The Taian Yarn Factory and Mitsui & Co. are also rushing to close down. Many Japanese women and children have returned to their country. Our officials and people remain extremely calm, and public order is solid. (Special dispatch on the 31st)

### Tianjin Refugees Tragically Slaughtered

[Nanjing] Nanjing received a Tianjin dispatch stating that on the morning of the 31st, Japanese troops continued to set fires on Huangwei Road in Hebei, with many civilian houses and shops being burned. More than ten Japanese planes also circled in the sky, reconnoitering various places. At around 10:00 AM, Japanese troops shelled various places in the suburbs, causing heavy damage to various tall buildings. At around 11:00 AM, heavy rain fell, slightly halting the Japanese army's cruel acts. Tens of thousands of refugees from the Hebei area fled to the concessions for shelter. A portion of them were stopped in the Third Special District and are now being housed in the former site of the Qianxin Trading Company, the East Tianxian Theater, and various empty houses, but without anyone providing relief, they are without food all day, their cries shaking the heavens, a truly miserable sight. According to refugees who escaped, Japanese troops set fires everywhere in Hebei on the night of the 30th. The municipal hospital is now overcrowded with refugees. On the morning of the 31st, a large number of refugees, numbering more than ten thousand, continued to cross the International Bridge into the French concession, mostly with nowhere to go, and slept on the roadside at night. When asked about their escape, everyone shed tears. They all lived in areas outside the railway in Hebei and Hedong. When Japanese troops arrived, they first set fires, then strafed with machine guns, causing families to scatter and loved ones to be separated during the escape. Furthermore, some who saw their wives and children being shot and went forward to help were also murdered by the Japanese army, a truly tragic scene. Such atrocities are unprecedented in the world. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)

[Nanjing] According to reports from relevant sources, on the afternoon of the 31st, Japanese troops conducted house-to-house searches in the Hebei area of Tianjin, arbitrarily slaughtering people, and ordered various shops to open for business. Dongma Road and Hebei Dama Road are now patrolled by Japanese soldiers, and there is no one on the streets. Refugees and wounded security forces in the municipal hospital were evacuated on the afternoon of the 31st, as rumors spread that Japanese aircraft would bomb it on the afternoon of the 31st. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)

### Fenglin Village Reduced to Ashes

[Nanjing] Nanjing received a Tianjin dispatch stating that Nilin Village outside the Hedong Railway has now been completely bombarded by artillery fired by Japanese troops, and all houses have been reduced to ashes. The Japanese army began shelling at 3:00 PM on the 31st, and the shelling continued for more than an hour. The village was originally a residential area for the poor, and the number of those who failed to escape beforehand was estimated to be in the thousands. After this continuous bombardment, it is feared that few survived. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)

[Nanjing] Nanjing received a Tianjin dispatch stating that, starting at noon on the 31st, Japanese troops bombed the Fenglin Village area in Hedong with artillery, which did not stop until 5:00 PM. Now tens of thousands of nearby residents are fleeing along the Hai River bank, hoping to cross the river into the British concession, but to no avail. Drenched by heavy rain and with nowhere to turn, they are still wandering on the riverbank, a very pitiful sight. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)

[Nanjing] According to relevant sources, a report from Tianjin stated that Japanese troops erected artillery in the middle of Dajing Road in Hebei at 2:00 PM on the 31st, aiming and firing at the Mint, which has now been hit and is on fire. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)

### Japanese Troops in Tianjin Wound French Soldiers

[Tianjin] According to French sources, Japanese soldiers clashed with French soldiers today, and opened fire, wounding two French soldiers and killing one Annamese soldier. This was because Japanese soldiers were angered by not being able to pass through the French concession, and when they encountered several French soldiers and Annamese soldiers at the East Station, they attempted to disarm them and, beforehand, tried to blindfold the French soldiers with cloth. The French soldiers refused to comply and resisted, so the Japanese soldiers opened fire. The French authorities are very angry about this and have lodged a protest. (Special dispatch on the 31st)

[Nanjing] Foreign sources in Nanjing stated that on the 30th, a French non-commissioned officer and a soldier stationed in Tianjin were disarmed by Japanese troops at the Tianjin East Station, and they attempted to blindfold them. The non-commissioned officer resisted and was killed. An Annamese soldier was also killed. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)

### Wang Jingwei Discusses the Significance of the Final Moment

Be patient when the time has not yet come; be prepared to sacrifice when the time has come.  Be sure to turn people and land to ashes, and leave no seed of a puppet.

[Nanjing] Chairman Wang recently gave an important speech entitled "The Final Moment." The following is an excerpt from the original speech:

Fellow comrades, on the 15th of this month, I said a few words to you about saving the nation and preserving its existence. What I want to say now is to elaborate on those few words. On the 15th of this month, the Lugouqiao Incident had already occurred for several days. At that time, I said that although the evolution of this incident could not be predicted, this incident was definitely not accidental, but a pre-planned one. Therefore, we can only respond according to our established policy. As for the 17th, Commander-in-Chief Chiang had already solemnly announced the policy in the first session of the talks, and all the newspapers across the country had published it, which all of you comrades have seen. Among them, there is a most clear and most important sentence, which says that China has reached its final moment today. Now I would like to explain the four words "final moment." We remember that in the Fifth Plenary Session in November 1935, Commander-in-Chief Chiang once said, "If peace is not completely hopeless, we will never lightly abandon peace; if sacrifice is not at the final moment, we will never lightly speak of sacrifice." These words have been clearly explained in the Second Plenary Session, and the diplomatic policy of the Third Plenary Session is also based on these words. We know that Japan's aggression against China is endless. Since September 18th, it has been killing its way into China step by step, while China has been retreating step by step. Why has China been retreating step by step? Because China is six or seventy years behind Japan in terms of progress. China's national power cannot withstand Japan's aggression. So, what has been the policy of China's diplomacy and domestic affairs since September 18th? To sum it up, diplomatically, it cannot stop Japan from killing its way in step by step, and can only think of ways to make it advance more slowly. China has no choice but to retreat step by step, and can only think of ways to make us retreat more slowly. Why do we want to slow down? Is it to take this opportunity to live in ease and seek temporary comfort? No, we just want to take advantage of this slowness to free up some time to do various preparatory work in domestic affairs to strengthen our resistance. This has been the policy of China's diplomacy and domestic affairs since September 18th. Since September 18th, China has appealed to the League of Nations over the September 18th Incident, originally wanting to use the League of Nations' moral sanctions, economic sanctions, and military sanctions to prevent Japan from killing its way into China step by step. However, in fact, apart from some minor moral sanctions, there was no hope of economic or military sanctions from the League of Nations. Therefore, Japan's killing its way in step by step has not stopped, and the three northeastern provinces have successively fallen. At this time, we can only do some work to call on the whole country to unite sincerely and face the national crisis together. However, these works are only just beginning and have not yet achieved anything. As a result of Japan's killing its way in step by step, the September 18th Incident progressed to the January 28th Incident. With the bitter fighting of the 19th Route Army, the 5th Army, and the reinforcements from various places, and the good offices of the League of Nations investigation team, Shanghai fell in early March, resulting in the signing of the Shanghai Truce Agreement. The Shanghai Truce Agreement was naturally a major loss, but the reason why this agreement was signed at that time was to make Japan advance more slowly and us retreat more slowly, taking advantage of this slowness to quickly do various preparatory work, such as the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi being able to proceed and the road network in the southeastern provinces being able to be completed. Was this worth it or not? Let the public judge. After the Shanghai Truce Agreement, in just over a year, the Rehe War and the battles at the various passes of the Great Wall broke out again. Japan's killing its way in step by step became even tighter. By the time our army was defeated, Rehe had fallen, and the various passes of the Great Wall had also successively fallen, there was the Tanggu Truce Agreement. This was naturally an even greater loss, but the reason why this agreement was signed at that time was to make Japan advance more slowly and us retreat more slowly, taking advantage of this slowness to quickly do various preparatory work. We realized that there were too many shortcomings in terms of spirit and material, that our resistance was weak and fragmented, and that we could not fully unleash the resistance of the entire country and the entire nation. Moreover, there were many who were pulling us back from the side and the rear, so in terms of spirit, we sought unity, organization, improvement, and accelerated training, and in terms of material, national defense equipment and national economic construction progressed simultaneously. In two or three years, there was some achievement in terms of spirit, and the achievement in terms of material also had numbers to calculate. The cause of unification cannot be said to be completed, but it cannot be said that there was no progress. As for the suppression of bandits, the southeastern provinces were successively cleared. Was this worth it or not? Let the public judge. After the Tanggu Truce Agreement, what continued to happen were the issues of through traffic and through mail. Under the principle of not recognizing the puppet state, we reluctantly resolved the issue of through traffic by not using puppet state train tickets and the issue of through mail by not using puppet state postage stamps. As for the issue of through navigation, we are still continuing to insist. And in June 1935, Japan's killing its way in became tighter step by step. From May 25th, verbal negotiations continued until June 9th. In view of the situation, we had no choice but to make various emergency dispositions, because by June 12th, it would be the time for Japan to act freely. These various emergency dispositions, which were a major loss, were indeed unbearable and unyielding, but we still endured and yielded. The reason why we did so at that time was to make Japan advance more slowly and us retreat more slowly. For this reason, various preparatory work could still be carried out, and we did our best to work hard in terms of spirit and material. In the meantime, such as the completion of the suppression of bandits in the southwest, the unification of Guangdong and Guangxi, etc. Was this worth it or not? Let the public judge. We have endured and yielded in this way for a full six years. We cannot but think that this killing its way in step by step is endless, and that this retreating step by step is endless. Moreover, our preparations, we know, and Japan also knows. We can frankly say, "These preparations are all necessary for modern countries. We rely on this to be an enemy to others, and we also rely on this to be a friend to others. Whether we are an enemy or a friend does not only depend on us, but also depends on others." However, Japan will say this, "We not only do not allow you to be an enemy to me, but also do not allow you to be a friend to me." Then our preparations will not only fail to achieve the result of slowing down, but will instead awaken Japan to accelerate its killing its way in step by step. It is impossible not to prepare in this way, but it is impossible to prepare. When we think of ways to retreat step by step, we cannot but draw a final line. Before this final moment, we allow ourselves to think of ways. It is best not to retreat, but if we have to retreat, we should try our best to retreat more slowly. But when we reach this final moment, we will all stand still and cannot retreat any further. As we said before, if peace is not completely hopeless, we will never abandon peace; if sacrifice is not at the final moment, we will never lightly speak of sacrifice. When the "time has not yet come," we must have the greatest determination and courage to endure; and when the "time has come," we must have the greatest determination and courage to sacrifice. If we had sacrificed rashly without enduring in the past, then the sacrifice would have been meaningless. If we still talk about preparation without sacrificing today, then the preparation would be even more meaningless. The two words "sacrifice" are harsh. We sacrifice ourselves, and we must also make all the people of the country sacrifice together, because we are a weak country, and we are the people of a weak country. What we call resistance has no other content. Its content is only sacrifice. We must make every person and every piece of land become ashes, so that the enemy will not get anything in their hands. This meaning is certainly harsh, but if we do not do this, there will be even harsher things following behind. In terms of substance, if we do not sacrifice, then there will only be puppets. In Chinese history, there have been several times when it was half-conquered by foreign races, and twice when it was completely conquered. These conquests were not because the invaders could kill all 400 million of us or destroy all our more than 4 million square kilometers of land, but because after a few people with spirit died, most of the people without spirit offered their own bodies and all their land to the invaders as a place of wealth and honor. Therefore, the invaders were able to easily get most of us and all the land. Are we still going to be puppets today? If we don't be puppets, we have to sacrifice. We are a weak country, and we are the people of a weak country. When it comes to defeating others, we may not be able to do it, but when it comes to sacrificing ourselves, no matter how weak we are, there is no reason why we cannot do it. If we cannot do it, it is because we do not want to, not because we cannot. The so-called not wanting is that we do not have the determination to sacrifice, but only the determination to be a puppet. We not only sacrifice ourselves because we do not want to be puppets, but we also do not want to see our compatriots become puppets after we sacrifice ourselves. Therefore, we must force our compatriots to sacrifice together, leaving no seed of a puppet. Whether it is in a bustling city or in a remote village, we must turn people and land to ashes. Although we cannot stop the enemy from killing its way in, we will certainly be able to ensure that the enemy will get nothing after killing its way in. For several years, we have been racking our brains, talking about unity, talking about organization, and talking about training, so that at the final moment, we can mobilize the spiritual power of the entire country and the entire nation to control and use the various material constructions that have been accumulated over time, and strengthen our resistance to aggression. The so-called resistance is to be able to make the entire country and the entire nation sacrifice for resisting aggression. If there are no weak people in the world, then there are no strong people in the world. Then, after we have sacrificed, our goal of resistance will also be achieved. We shout out one sentence: the final moment! We shout out another sentence even louder: Sacrifice! (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)

They are scheduled to take the Beijing-Shanghai overnight express train at around 1 AM this morning (1st) to go to Beijing to listen to instructions, planning to stay for about a week before returning to Shanghai. The High Court's ruling is appended below:

High Court Ruling

(Main Text) The defendants Shen Junru, Zhang Naiqi, Wang Zaoshi, Li Gongpu, Zou Taofen, Sha Qianli, and Shi Liang shall each submit a guarantee from a substantial person or business worth 200 yuan to be allowed to suspend detention. (Reason) According to the provisions of Article 111, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, when permitting an application for suspension of detention, a guarantee shall be ordered to be submitted, and a corresponding guarantee amount shall be specified. The applicants Shen Gang et al. stated that the various defendants Shen Junru et al. in the case of endangering the Republic of China have been detained for half a year, causing mental distress, and their families have lost their support. They applied for suspension of detention. This court finds no impropriety in the examination and approval and should approve it. However, the applicant shall submit a guarantee from a substantial person or business worth 200 yuan in order to be released on bail. This ruling is made as in the main text. July 30, 26th year, Presiding Judge Zhu Songzhou, Judge Zhang Zepu, Judge Li Yue. Luo Qing, who was also detained in the case, was also released on bail at the same time on the 31st.

Shen Junru's Remarks

When Shen and others were released from prison, they were as lively as ever, and their attitude towards resisting the enemy and saving the country was still very active. According to Shen Junru's words to the reporter, Junru and others have been detained by the court for more than half a year. Although in prison, they felt quite comfortable physically. This time, the judicial authorities ruled to allow the suspension of detention. As for the future outcome of this case, they will naturally listen to the court's decision. As Junru and others stepped out of the prison gate today, seeing the call for resistance against the enemy spreading throughout the country, they felt extremely happy in their hearts. They will not change their original intention and vowed to strive for the liberation of the nation and the people. (Special dispatch of the 31st)

Singing the March of the Volunteers

[Suzhou] After Shen Junru and others were released on bail today, they stayed at the Huayuan Hotel. When they arrived at the hotel entrance, the Wu County Anti-Enemy Support Association Song Troupe asked Shen and others to express their opinions. Shen and others had no opinions because they had just been released from prison. However, in order to show their spirit, they sang the March of the Volunteers with the troupe once. After singing, led by Shi Liang, they shouted "Long live the Republic of China, long live!" Then Shen and others bowed to the troupe and dispersed. At 7 PM, Shen and others and their families went to the Guohuo Company's third-floor restaurant to attend the welcoming banquet hosted by Zhang Shenren and others. During the banquet, people from all walks of life asked Shen and others to express their opinions. They replied that they would not change their original purpose and would unite the country to resist Japan and save the country. Shen and others decided to visit each guarantor tomorrow morning to express their gratitude and then go to Beijing to meet with various authorities and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for instructions, planning to stay for about a week before returning to Shanghai.

### National Government Issues Order to Commend Tong Linge and Zhao Dengyu

Posthumously Awarded the Rank of Army General and Given Generous Posthumous Compensation; Their Life Deeds Will Be Recorded and Publicized in the National History Museum

[Nanjing] The National Government issued a clear order on the 31st, stating that Tong Linge, Deputy Commander of the 29th Army of the Army, and Zhao Dengyu, Commander of the 132nd Division of the Army, were skilled in military strategy and had led their troops for a long time. In the Northern Expedition to Suppress Bandits and the battles at Xifengkou, they were able to defeat the enemy and make meritorious contributions. This time, in the battle in Beiping, they both took defending the country and preserving its territory as their duty. They repeatedly charged forward, fighting fiercely and fearlessly. Their loyalty and bravery are enough to inspire morale and set an example for the military. Unfortunately, they were trapped in heavy encirclement and died in battle. Remembering their heroism, we deeply mourn their loss. Tong Linge and Zhao Dengyu are both posthumously awarded the rank of Army General, and the Executive Yuan will be instructed to grant generous posthumous compensation. Their life deeds will be recorded and publicized in the National History Museum to honor their loyalty and inspire future generations. This is the order. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 31st)

### Japanese Bombing of Tianjin Has Horrified the World

British Newspaper Laments the Decline of International Morality; U.S. President Does Not Take Vacation to Pay Attention to the Overall Situation

[London] Regarding the Japanese bombing of Tianjin, the News Chronicle here published an editorial stating that the incident has horrified the world, but not deeply enough. The newspaper said, "Japan can certainly escape its consequences, as the bombing of this large city is nothing more than a common event after even greater aggression occurs. The extent to which international morality has declined can be evidenced by the world's indifferent inaction towards the Japanese bombing of Tianjin. In the past, such as the ancient Spanish city of Guernica, and more recently the Spanish capital of Madrid, and now Tianjin in China, or even London in the future being bombed by the enemy, the world will also turn a blind eye, and only the people of London will feel the pain." (Reuters dispatch of the 31st from Central News Agency)

[London] The House of Commons debated foreign policy for the last time today. Foreign Secretary Eden expressed regret over the changes in the Far East situation and said that Britain would continue to liaise with France and the United States. After discussing Mediterranean policy and the non-intervention issue, it was announced that the session would be adjourned until October 21st. If there is an emergency, a meeting can be convened earlier. Around October 26th, the King will personally attend the opening ceremony. (Reuters dispatch of the 30th from Central News Agency)

[London] The House of Commons held its last meeting today before the adjournment. Members of Parliament from the government and opposition parties engaged in heated debate on foreign policy and general international issues. The speech by Major Attlee, Chairman of the Labor Party caucus, regarding the conflict between China and Japan in the Far East, made a significant impression in the chamber. Attlee believed that the conflict between China and Japan had deteriorated and become a "real war." He said, "This conflict seems to have broken out and become a war. We know that this disturbance originated from local events, and I dare not say that the Japanese government should be fully responsible for the actions of the Japanese army. However, the Japanese army has no right to operate on the Pinghan Railway, which I know for sure. China has always been patient to the greatest extent, with the aim of maintaining peace. However, as a result of China's patience, Japan has made further progress in aggression. The actions of the Japanese army this time are just another infringement on China's territorial integrity." (Havas dispatch of the 30th from Central News Agency)

[Washington] President Roosevelt told the press corps today that the situation between China and Japan was "very disturbing." He does not intend to rest at the end of this week so that he can closely monitor the development of the situation. (National News dispatch of the 30th)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull said that the U.S. government has not held talks with any other country in hopes of stopping the fighting between Chinese and Japanese troops in North China. He also said that the United States is currently consulting with the governments of the countries concerned to exchange information on the situation in the Far East, but collective action is not being considered. In short, the United States is still taking a detached approach to the events in the Far East. (Havas dispatch of the 30th from Central News Agency)

[Washington] It is reported that the U.S. Consul General in Tianjin, Judd, reported to the State Department that although the situation is calmer, the U.S. Embassy is still advising American citizens residing in the Legation Quarter not to return to their homes outside the Legation Quarter for the time being. (Reuters dispatch of the 30th from Central News Agency)

[Paris] The Foreign Ministry announced today that 500 French residents in Beiping have decided to be fully protected by the French Embassy's guard, and sufficient food and other necessities have been stored in advance for emergency use. (National News dispatch of the 30th)

### American and Russian Newspapers Criticize Japanese Military Aggression

Disregarding All Treaty Constraints; The Interests of All Countries Are Affected

[New York] The New York Times published another commentary today, strongly criticizing the aggressive behavior of the Japanese military, titled "Japan's Desperate Gamble." The article first stated that Japan has rejected the advice of Britain and the United States and that it would be futile for Western countries to expect the Tokyo authorities to change their current policies. Japan has often disregarded the advice of other countries in the past six years, and the interests of all countries have been severely affected. It has disregarded all treaty constraints and has not sought a peaceful solution with China to resolve the differences between the two countries. Now that the situation is becoming more serious, Japan will naturally regard the advice of Western countries with even greater contempt. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 31st)

[Moscow] The Communist Party's organ newspaper, Pravda, published an article stating that the defensive strength of the Chinese army is increasing day by day. The 19th Route Army of China had already proven its prowess in the Shanghai War in 1932. The Chinese army is not only elite, but its equipment is also quite good. The results of the Suiyuan War last year were enough to make the Chinese army more confident. The results of the recent fighting between Chinese troops and the Japanese regular army near Beiping are also sufficient to prove the true value of the Chinese army, as the Japanese army is not only better equipped but also has more personnel. Once China and Japan go to war, Japan will not only need a large number of personnel, but the financial burden will also be enormous. If the war is prolonged, the morale of the Japanese army will inevitably decline. In short, the Japanese warlords are now playing with fire, which the sober-minded bourgeoisie in that country also deeply know the danger of. (Havas dispatch of the 30th from Central News Agency)

[Rome] The newspaper "Stampa" commented on the situation in the Far East, believing that the events in the Far East, especially the arrival of the Japanese army in Beiping, are of extremely important significance. "Japan's expansionist policy is like an oil slick on the water, expanding day by day. It can be asserted that even if the international community wants to reject it, it may be difficult, because diplomatic weapons are no longer effective." (Central News Agency dispatch of the 30th)

The details are unknown. At around 5 AM on the morning of the 30th, there were planes in the western direction of the sky over Zhangyuan.

### After Yin, the Traitor, Was Captured, Chi Zongmo Succeeded Him in the Puppet Position

Appointed in the Name of Kagetoshi

[Tianjin] The Japanese Garrison Headquarters has now officially announced that Yin Rugeng, the traitor, has been captured by the righteous security forces.

The Japanese military camp was immediately surrounded by the security force, and a fierce battle broke out between the two sides. The sound of cannons, machine guns, and rifles rang out at once. Countless Japanese soldiers were killed. In the afternoon, 30 Japanese planes flew in and bombed for several hours. The security force gradually lost ground and retreated. The houses of the Tongzhou puppet government were completely destroyed, and the gatehouse of the American school was also damaged. The rest were unharmed, and the American teachers Martin and Henderson escaped safely. (Reuters dispatch of the 31st from Central News Agency)

[Tianjin] According to a Japanese military spokesman, Chi Zongmo has now succeeded Yin, the traitor, and Kagetoshi has formally appointed him. The Japanese troops in Tongzhou have broken out of the encirclement after being bombed by reinforcements. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 31st)

[Baoding] Zhang Qingyu and Zhang Yantian, commanders of the security forces stationed in Tongxian County, issued a public telegram on the 30th after their uprising. The original text is as follows (titles omitted): "The Japanese bandits are tyrannical, and Heaven has brought disaster to China. Qingyu and Yantian were ordered to establish the First and Second Special Police Security Regiments in the war zone after the Tanggu Truce Agreement was forced upon us by the enemy after the Battle of the Great Wall. For the convenience of unified command and bandit suppression, we temporarily came under the command and dispatch of Yin Rugeng, the administrative inspector of the Ji-Mi District. Originally, we hoped to work together to stabilize the local area and appease the people. Unexpectedly, Yin, the traitor, was blinded by greed and willingly acted as a puppet, driven by the enemy, betraying the party and the country, and abandoned by both gods and men. At that time, it would not have been difficult to capture him, the chief bandit, and offer him as a prisoner to the central government. However, because the country was in trouble and the strategy was to be friendly with our neighbors, and more importantly because we had not received orders, we had to make a false show of compliance, enduring humiliation and waiting for an opportunity. Recently, the enemy's flames have become more intense, and the national crisis has deepened. The Lugouqiao Incident is nothing more than the beginning of the annexation of the entire North China. Yin Rugeng and others, insane, have been plundering the local area and draining the pond to catch fish. They have specially set up a supply committee to plan supplies for the enemy and maintain the rear. On the 28th, the enemy bombed our 29th Army troops stationed in Tong County with a regiment of troops, plus airplanes and artillery. When the enemy's artillery fired, the entire army wept. What time is this? Yin, the traitor, led his close followers and watched from the city walls, taking pleasure in it. Qingyu and Yantian believe that the enemy is plotting against us with determination. Only through concerted efforts and obedience to the leaders can we achieve the effect of saving the country and resisting aggression. How can we occupy the border for long? We are ashamed to be behind others in serving the country. Therefore, at dawn on the 29th, we swore an oath with tears, and with a single drumbeat, we shattered the various organs of the puppet organization, as well as the garrison team, the special service agency, and the police station of the violent Japanese in Tongzhou, capturing the traitors and the Japanese. On that day, we fought with the Japanese planes in flesh and blood. In addition to sending Liu Honglian, the director of the General Affairs Office of our department, to Baoding to meet with the superior and ask for instructions, all future actions will be in accordance with the orders of Chairmen Chiang and Song. We hope that the advanced elements in the country and the national army in all places will provide us with guidance and assistance. We are extremely anxious. Specially reported, Zhang Qingyu, commander of the First Special Security Regiment of Hebei Province, Zhang Yantian, commander of the Second Regiment, and the entire officers and soldiers of the Teaching Corps, 20,000 in all, respectfully salute. The 30th." (Central News Agency dispatch of the 30th)

### The Psychology of Bare Survival

— Tao Xisheng

Today, the most beneficial thing for the enemy country is the division of the Chinese people themselves. Today, the enemy country’s most ferocious policy is to promote the self-division of China under the overwhelming pressure of Mount Tai. Look at how it advances into Chinese territory on one hand, and declares it will not expand the situation, and continues to talk about peace on the other. This is exactly what it is saying to the Chinese people: “If you don’t dare to fight, there is a way out here.” If the Chinese people really take the way out it leaves, the result will only be division, and the result of division is destruction.

The obvious path to destruction is treaties that forfeit rights and humiliate the nation. This is what the enemy country wants to obtain, but it is not easy to obtain such a treaty from any Chinese person. If the Chinese people do not suffer defeat, they will not agree to its treaties, and what it obtains will not be much. The enemy country sees this clearly, and in addition to using force to obtain such treaties, it goes a step further, using a method of high pressure on one hand and leaving a way out on the other, to dissolve the Chinese people’s psychology of unity against foreign aggression and to disrupt the Chinese people’s unified steps against foreign aggression. Its success will certainly be greater and more extensive than obvious treaties.

On the ways out it leaves, two types of people will embark on them. The first type of person believes that they can exist by betraying the nation and the government, and therefore actively betrays the nation and the government and becomes attached to the enemy country. Formally, the enemy country does not annex this piece of territory, but only that the Republic of China is betrayed, and even the emblem of the Republic of China can be retained. This type of person believes that doing so is beneficial for private gain, and can maintain an independent existence, and can avoid annexation, not only avoiding the crisis of destruction, but also surviving in this world.

The second type of person believes that they can exist by leaving the nation and the government, and therefore passively leaves the nation and the government to seek their own survival. This type of person can be further divided into two major categories.

The first category believes that the government’s policy towards the enemy is too strong and not suitable for mitigating the enemy country’s aggression, and therefore breaks away from the government to seek reconciliation with the enemy country. The psychology of survival of this type of person is excusable. Before China has the strength to fight a major war, making concessions for the sake of temporary ease seems to be a solution. However, the enemy country can use this psychology of ours to obtain considerable benefits and preparations for our destruction.

The second category believes that the government’s policy towards the enemy is too weak and not suitable for saving the nation and seeking survival, and therefore does not follow the government but seeks its own way out. This type of person can be further divided into two factions.

The first faction consistently advocates a strong policy but is dissatisfied with the government. This faction knows that although the government’s policy is not strong enough, if one were to take measures to resist the government because of this, and to achieve a strong policy by splitting up, then before the strong policy is realized, the government’s strength against the enemy would already be dispersed. This faction of people can only change to supporting the government’s attitude now.

The second faction outwardly advocates a strong policy but in reality caters to the enemy country’s psychology. They oppose the government with high-sounding rhetoric, using this rhetoric as a defense for opposing the government, but in reality, they are seeking their own division and dispersing China’s strength against foreign aggression. In the eyes of the enemy country, this method is very beneficial, not only tolerating their activities but even protecting their activities.

The first type of person is a complete traitor, which needs no explanation. Among the second type of people, the second faction of the second category is also a traitor, which is not easy to see. The first category of the second type, despite its infinite subjective grievances, ultimately cannot achieve objective results. The first faction of the second category of the second type, if it can abandon its subjective distress and objectively serve the integrity and existence of the country, is worthy of our admiration. In short, “When the nest is overturned, no egg remains intact” is a saying that very well fits China’s current situation. If we want to be an intact egg under the overturned nest, no matter how subjective we are, we are objectively in danger of self-division. Today, only by unanimously holding the attitude of not splitting up and not surviving in humiliation can we find a way out. If one takes the predetermined way out of the enemy country with the psychology of surviving in humiliation, even with the sincerity of preserving the country’s territory, one will inevitably be fooled. Those who do not have this sincerity but use high-sounding rhetoric as a defense cannot have their motives questioned.

### Germany and Russia Vigorously Denounce Each Other on the Spanish Question

The Non-Intervention Committee Again Reaches an Impasse; British Representative Again Negotiates a Compromise

[London] The British delegation to the Non-Intervention Committee began seeking ways to break the deadlock and reconcile differences tonight, but its nature is still unknown. It will inevitably seek a compromise based on the opinions expressed by the representatives of Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Russia. The UK, in view of the seriousness of the situation resulting from the current deadlock, is working hard on this. (31st National Maritime Telecommunications)

[London] After examination by the subcommittee, it was felt that the general opinions were still coordinated, but other important difficulties were discovered. After a brief discussion of these difficulties, the meeting was adjourned. No decision has been made on when the next meeting will be convened. Plymouth, after convening the meeting, also said in his brief report that the answers from the various countries were generally still harmonious, but the granting of belligerent rights to combat groups was a fundamental difficulty. Furthermore, the implementation procedures after the plan is passed are also a matter of contention. The withdrawal of volunteers and the recognition of belligerent rights of combat groups are related in order, which is quite difficult to reconcile. (30th Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency)

[London] The subcommittee of the Coordination Committee for Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War failed to reach a compromise on the British compromise plan today. One reason is that the Soviet Union has consistently opposed recognizing the belligerent status of both parties in the civil war while foreign volunteers in Spain have not been completely withdrawn. The second reason is that Italy and Germany still insist that the recognition of belligerent status should precede the withdrawal of volunteers. For this reason, the deadlock on non-intervention continues. It is reported that the second meeting of the subcommittee will be held on August 5. Before this date, Chairman Committee, namely British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Plymouth, will probably begin negotiations to persuade the Soviet Union and Germany and Italy to change their positions. As for the future, there are two different views. Optimists believe that the countries concerned have repeatedly expressed their commitment to the non-intervention agreement and will not bear the responsibility for the complete failure of the non-intervention measures. However, pessimists believe that the hope of success for the compromise plan proposed by the UK on July 14 is now extremely weak. (30th Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency)

[London] The subcommittee of the Coordination Committee for Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War held a meeting this afternoon. The recent speeches of German representative Ribbentrop and Soviet representative Maisky have attracted much attention. The two men attacked each other, each accusing the other of deliberately undermining the non-intervention measures. Ribbentrop said that the Soviet Union had brazenly refused to recognize both parties in the Spanish civil war as belligerents, and that these people had destroyed the British compromise plan. The Soviet Union had accepted the British compromise plan as a basis for discussion on the 16th of this month, but now it refuses to accept the recognition of belligerents, which is strange. If the countries do not recognize the authority of General Franco, the leader of the Spanish National Army, and say that General Franco can first implement the surveillance system in his jurisdiction, who will believe it? In conclusion, he said that the attitude adopted by the Soviet Union has created a completely different new situation for Germany, and Germany has to reserve its attitude. French representative Corbin then spoke, explaining that France had made various concessions in order to ensure that the British compromise plan could be successful. The British compromise plan clearly advocated that the recognition of both parties in the Spanish civil war should be conditional on the prior withdrawal of volunteers from various countries. This order is the true essence of the British compromise plan. It is inappropriate for the German representative to attach more importance to the order of discussion than to the procedure of implementation. Soviet representative Maisky then spoke, saying that whether or not countries are sincere about non-intervention in the Spanish civil war can be best tested by the withdrawal of volunteers. If the non-intervention measures fail because a compromise cannot be reached on the issue of the withdrawal of volunteers, then there is no doubt as to who is responsible. As for the recognition of both parties in the Spanish civil war as belligerents, it is irrelevant to the non-intervention measures. Even if the belligerent status of combat groups in the Spanish civil war is not recognized, the non-intervention measures can continue to be carried out. Maisky also said that it is strange that the governments of Italy and Germany did not raise the issue of recognition in the past six months, but now they are raising it when the United Kingdom and other countries are advocating the withdrawal of volunteers. In conclusion, he said that if the non-intervention measures fail, the responsibility should be borne by Italy and Germany. (30th Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency)

[London] Regarding the British compromise plan for non-intervention in the Spanish civil war, nine countries have submitted replies, which have just been published by the Coordination Committee. Among them, the reply from the British government is completely accepted without reservation, which is expected. In addition, the replies from Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden stated that although they are willing to accept it in principle, they believe that the large-scale withdrawal of foreign volunteers from Spain is a necessary condition for recognizing both parties in the Spanish civil war as belligerents. The reply submitted by the French government also stated that it was accepted with the condition that surveillance system be restored and that it could be accepted after a large-scale withdrawal of foreign volunteers. It also stated that although the French government could recognize that both parties in the Spanish civil war enjoy belligerent rights in the sea, land, and air, considerable restrictions should be added. The German reply advocated that the withdrawal of foreign volunteers and the recognition that both parties in the Spanish civil war enjoy belligerent rights in the sea, land, and air should be implemented simultaneously. The replies from Italy and Portugal fully accepted all the points contained in the British compromise plan, but advocated immediately recognizing both parties in the Spanish civil war as belligerents. The reply submitted by the Soviet government firmly rejected the level that the recognition of belligerent status should be negotiated immediately by the United Kingdom with both parties in the Spanish civil war, saying that the Soviet Union could reconsider it only after all foreign volunteers, including Moroccan natives, had been withdrawn from Spain.

[London] The House of Commons held its last meeting today. Labour Party leader Attlee raised various facts on the Spanish issue, proving that the Spanish rebels are relying on the assistance of various countries to quickly determine the situation of the civil war, while the Spanish government forces will ultimately be hindered by one-sided non-intervention measures. He then said that the Spanish rebels have become vassals of foreign countries, and the British government must not recognize them as belligerents. Then, Foreign Secretary Eden rose to answer, with quite skillful wording, roughly saying that the non-intervention system is not purely British, but international. If the League of Nations is willing to handle the Spanish incident itself, the United Kingdom would be happy to welcome it, but so far we have not seen the League of Nations have this intention. Then, former Prime Minister Lloyd George, a Liberal Party member of the opposition, spoke, almost launching a personal attack on Eden, saying that in view of the Abyssinian incident, the Far East incident, and the Spanish incident, Eden should be held responsible for the decline in the authority of the League of Nations. As for the government’s constant talk of cooperation with France to defend its policies, it is also quite strange. “If former French Tiger Prime Minister Clemenceau were still alive today, he would never allow Germany and Italy to occupy the Mediterranean islands, thereby cutting off France’s transportation with Africa. Now France seems to have awakened, but we British have not yet.” Finally, Lloyd George asked Eden to provide assurance to Parliament that if the government intends to recognize the Spanish rebels as belligerents, it must first seek the opinion of Parliament before doing so. Eden replied that this could not be done, as everything depends on international decisions. After Eden spoke, several other members of Parliament spoke, and finally the House of Commons decided to adjourn the meeting and reconvene on October 21.

Releases Important Orders

[Paris] Finance Minister Bonnet recently gave a speech to the newspapers, saying that the government has now drafted two important legislative decrees, which will be promulgated tomorrow.

He urged the Mandates Commission to immediately submit for discussion the plan proposed by the United Kingdom to divide Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab state. Then, the Commission held a closed-door meeting and decided to request that the United Kingdom provide supplementary explanations for this plan. (30th Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency)

[Geneva] When the League of Nations Trustee Committee held its first meeting today, British Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore attended and announced that the British government had not yet studied in detail the plan to divide Palestine contained in the committee's report.

According to the committee's proposal, negotiations should still be held with Jewish and Arab people who are willing to negotiate, and a practical plan should be agreed upon to be submitted to the Trustee Committee, prepare a referendum, draft treaties and auxiliary financial and military agreements, and the trustee system for various parts of Palestine should be changed, and the British government will still be responsible for the trusteeship. Proceed with everything. Ormsby-Gore concluded by saying that it would be foolish to say that this matter is easy to carry out, but from the British government's point of view, all difficulties can be overcome. The British government intends to proceed in this direction, which is the best way to break the deadlock. (30th Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency)

### German Birth Rate

[Paris] Dr. Burgdörfer, a German statistics expert, gave a speech at the International Population Statistics Conference here, mentioning the German government's policies on birth rates. He stated that the total number of births in Germany was 2,000,000 in 1900, decreasing to 971,000 in 1933, but has since increased, reaching 1,200,000 in 1936. This is the result of the policies implemented by the National Socialist Party government. Germany's population increase policy has often been criticized, but if Germany wants to maintain its current total population, the total number of births must be at least 1,400,000 per year. Dr. Burgdörfer also stated that the increase in Germany's birth rate is not only due to the increase in the number of marriages, but also because of the increased desire for children, and the improvement in economic conditions is the fundamental reason for the increase in the birth rate.

Travel Correspondence

### On the National Defense Line (18)

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Shu Di

The target audience of the "Advocate for Justice Corps" is too broad. The contents are here. They cannot be described in detail one by one. For now, let's take "assisting in reporting traitors" as an example. According to their definition of the term "traitor," it is: "Anyone who colludes with foreigners and harms our country is a traitor, commonly known as a traitor to the nation." Regarding the specific methods of assisting in reporting such traitors, they have established three items: ㊀ In terms of propaganda, county and village corps should, within ten days after the opening of local primary schools, or when the "Justice Corps" holds "mass mobilization campaigns," jointly hold "parades and demonstrations to eliminate traitors" with local primary schools, post slogans, and shout slogans such as "Down with traitors." ㊁ In terms of advising and warning, for those suspected of being traitors, the county and village corps headquarters should send people to advise them or directly warn them. For those who are traitors in other places, the county and village corps headquarters should instruct their family members and relatives to write letters urging them to repent. The letters should be sent by the corps headquarters. If they cannot write, the corps headquarters will write for them. ㊂ In terms of formal assistance in reporting, if the neighborhood and village leaders do not report traitors in the streets and villages, the corps members should report to the village corps headquarters, which will notify the street and village leaders, assistant reporters, or handle the matter. If the matter is not handled or reported within seven days, the "County Corps Headquarters" will notify the relevant administrative district chief to handle the matter or report it. If the matter is still not handled or reported, the county corps leader will contact the county magistrate to handle it and report it to the general corps headquarters for verification.

The "Advocate for Justice Corps" does not have actual executive power; however, its vast scale of supervising politics and controlling society is enormous. No other public organization anywhere can compare to it. Therefore, some people say that it is actually the organization that took over and replaced the power of the Shanxi Party Headquarters after it was abolished.

Fourth, what is "good" and "bad"? What is "justice"?—These are originally very abstract concepts. To understand the meaning of the "Advocate for Justice Corps," we can only understand it from its background, its organization, its mission and tasks, and the targets of its work. However, what outsiders find most puzzling and suspicious about it are still the locations of these abstract concepts. Although the reporter tried his best to visit and investigate in Shanxi, the result is that I still cannot come to a concrete conclusion; however, one thing I can already determine is that these are, after all, metaphysical concepts; there is no concrete content.

I will reveal some of what I have found here.

The general slogan of the "Advocate for Justice Corps" is: "Advocate for Justice"; broken down, there are two slogans: one is "Support good officials, good gentry, and good people," and the other is "Sanction bad officials, bad gentry, and bad people." The Shanxi authorities once said: "The Advocate for Justice Corps is to unite good people into a group to sanction bad people." According to their meaning, it is enough to meet the conditions of being a member of the "Justice Corps," which is what the Shanxi authorities call "good people"; conversely, it is "bad people." So, what are the conditions for being a member of the "Justice Corps"? According to what they have stipulated, apart from the age limit not being able to be used as a distinction of quality, there are only two conditions: ㊀ "Able to advocate for justice," ㊁ Without specific behaviors: (A) Embezzlement and bribery, (B) Smoking opium, (C) Having been criminally punished, (D) Disobedient and unfilial. The so-called "able to advocate for justice" means being able to "stand up for injustice in society." According to the Shanxi authorities, the so-called "injustice in society" roughly includes ten items: (A) "Officials do not advocate for justice, protecting the powerful and wronging the powerless." (B) "Officials are corrupt and accept bribes." (C) "Officials have no sense of responsibility and are not enthusiastic about doing things for the people to promote benefits and eliminate abuses, resulting in the inability to promote benefits and eliminate abuses in society." (D) "Officials collude with bad gentry and local bullies, reversing right and wrong." (E) "Officials do not severely punish bad people, causing good people to suffer." (F) "Officials act arbitrarily, causing the people to suffer injustice." (G) "The family members and relatives of high officials and big gentry are unreasonable in local matters, and the family members and relatives of small officials and small gentry are also unreasonable in local matters, all bullying the people." (H) "Bad gentry, local bullies, and wealthy people do not pay taxes on their land and even resist apportionment." (I) "Large households bully small households." (J) "Bad officials and bad gentry take the opportunity to squander county funds, and bad village chiefs and deputies take the opportunity to squander village funds." Not long ago, it seems that two new items were added: (A) "Violating the regulations on banning opium and drugs" (B) "Promoting communism and collaborating with the enemy as a traitor." However, some opinions believe that in addition to the above two conditions, two more conditions should be added: (A) "Having a profession and being diligent in one's profession" (B) "Not gambling."

I once talked to a person in charge in Shanxi about such things: "Being able to stand up for injustice according to the twelve items of 'injustice in society' that you have listed, that action should be considered 'advocating for justice,' right?"

"There are many injustices in society, not necessarily limited to the twelve items listed; mainly, we should have a fair heart and judge the fairness of things at any time and in any place."

I also asked: "If there is a person who has a profession and is diligent in his profession, is able to advocate for justice, does not gamble, and also does not have one of the five specific behaviors, then that is considered a 'good person,' right?"

"In general, he can be considered a 'good person.'" He nodded. "However, the so-called specific behaviors are not limited to the five items listed; mainly, he should have the habits of a 'good person.'"

So, the problem falls back on the two points of "fair heart" and "habits." My attempt to summarize and obtain the specific content of the two terms "justice" and "good person" faltered again here.

Soon, I left Shanxi, and what I gained was only this much.

### North China Daily News Praises the 38th Division for Not Collaborating with the Enemy

All Officers and Soldiers of the Division Do Not Forget to Defend the Country; The Courageous Deeds of the Tongxian Troops Will Forever Remain in History.

The North China Daily News stated that the situation in Tianjin seems to be under control, but many lives have been lost and property has been greatly damaged. The Japanese government does not seem to be particularly moved by the actions of its representatives. A recent commentary in a certain Japanese newspaper seems to be surprised by the sudden intervention of the 38th Division, commanded by Tianjin Mayor Zhang Zizhong, in the Japanese military actions. This surprise is understandable because the Japanese have always regarded Zhang Zizhong as a representative recognized by Japanese officials. Zhang Zizhong has now moved to Beiping to begin organizing or restoring a new system of governance that obeys Japanese command. Zhang Zizhong has obviously failed to instill the policies he relies on to preserve his position into all the officers and soldiers of his division. In other words, this part of the division has not forgotten that they are Chinese soldiers and have the responsibility to defend the country and resist aggression. The Tongxian troops, with this spirit, refused the Japanese officers' request to disarm and were bombarded by Japanese planes, resulting in a position where the lack of military equipment was not important. However, their courageous achievements in representing Chinese sovereignty and resisting forever have remained in history. Other troops of the 38th Division also do not recognize the benefits of the Japanese favor enjoyed by their leader and show a tendency to rather seize the Japanese position than be with them. They have expressed their will and are willing to accept disadvantages, even at the cost of their lives. However, they have also drawn the attention of the general public to the ideas they hold, which are very similar to the sentiments expressed in Chairman Chiang's recent declaration. The situation in the north may be being arranged, but the events that have disrupted the overall situation have produced appetites that are not entirely suitable for the Japanese to follow their old tricks and expect as they must have expected. The Japanese aggression may feel that it has spread resentment and will eventually be known to all for the consequences that this action will have. Tokyo may address its military authorities stationed in Tianjin with sharp words regarding this intricate problem of miscalculation.

The Authorities' Attitude is Firm in Resistance

The North China Daily News reported from Nanjing on the 30th that people in Nanjing, both Chinese and foreign, were saddened and angered by the Japanese army's bombing of Tianjin, especially its focus on destroying universities and schools. However, as far as the senior officials of the central government are concerned, their attitude seems to have become more resolute due to the recent atrocities of the Japanese army. Chairman Chiang's strong and determined remarks on Thursday night have made it clear that there is little hope for peace negotiations in the future. The Chinese military authorities, of course, do not want to tell people the details of their military plans, but what the interviewer can be satisfied with is that Nanjing is now actively preparing for what is regarded here as a battle of life and death between the two countries. A certain senior official told the interviewer that once the war starts, there will be no such thing as a front post. We know deeply how to resist. When we strike, we will strike hard.

### All Chinese Employees Hired by Japanese Residents in Shantou Resign

Japanese Consul Asks City Government to Order Chinese Employees Not to Strike; And Falsely Claims That Japanese Residents Are Returning Home to Avoid the Summer Heat

Shantou Correspondence: The situation here is more serious than a few days ago. There are only about a hundred Japanese residents left in Shantou. The exchange trade between China and Japan, as well as passenger and cargo transportation, have all been suspended. The Shantou Taiwan Bank has stopped allowing Chinese depositors to withdraw money from their accounts and stopped doing exchange business between China and Japan since the 26th. Since the Shantou Japanese Bank is the only one, the economic relations between Chaozhou and Shantou have been interrupted. Chinese merchants who have deposits in the Taiwan Bank are unwilling to suffer losses and have jointly submitted a request to the city government to negotiate with the Japanese consulate to find a way to withdraw the money. However, it is reported that the important books of the bank have been moved to other places. If they want to withdraw their deposits, they have to wait until normal diplomatic relations are restored before they can withdraw them. In addition, about 1,000 Chinese personnel are employed in Japanese commercial firms, factories, and residences in Shantou. All these Chinese employees have voluntarily resigned since the 26th. As of the 29th, there are no Chinese workers in any Japanese shops, factories, or residences. The Japanese residents in Shantou have to cook, buy vegetables, and wash clothes themselves. No one can be hired. Yamazaki, the Japanese consul stationed in Shantou, visited Mayor Huang at noon on the 29th, stating that when Japanese ships arrive in Shantou, no one is available to load or unload passengers and cargo, when Japanese people leave the country, no one is available to carry luggage, no boats or vehicles can be hired, and when Japanese people live, no Chinese workers are available. He asked the city government to order the Chinese workers not to strike. If there is anything, we can discuss it at length. Mayor Huang replied that this is a manifestation of the Chinese people's fervent patriotism. They are unwilling to work and unwilling to earn money. The government cannot bear the responsibility of oppressing the workers. It only hopes to do its best to persuade them to resume work to quell the disputes. Mayor Huang also asked Yamazaki in return what the intention was of the Japanese residents leaving Shantou in recent days. Yamazaki replied that it has been hot in recent days, and the climate is often above ten degrees. Japanese residents are returning home to avoid the summer heat. At that time, they both understood each other, and then they shook hands and parted.

It has been found that the Japanese ships passing through Shantou from Hong Kong to Taiwan in recent days are full of Japanese people going to Taiwan, about four to five hundred people per ship. There are no empty seats in the first and second class cabins. As for the Chinese who go to Taiwan for business, when they depart from Shantou, they must have a guarantee from the Japanese stores of the Taiwan Association. After arriving in Keelung, they must have the seal of the local store before they can enter the country. The interrogation is extremely strict. In addition, recently, the Japanese consulate in Shantou has accommodated a large number of Taiwanese people and Japanese residents, so large pots are set up in the grass field in the consulate to cook food. It is said that those who are accommodated are prepared for use when necessary. (Evening of the 29th)

### Jasmine Flowers in Minhou are in Full Bloom

Harvesting Flowers for Ten Days is Worth a Million; Flower Farmers are Happily Elated

Fuzhou Correspondence: Farmers in Minhou County grow jasmine flowers, which bloom three times every year in spring and summer, commonly known as the first bloom, second bloom, and third bloom. Each harvest period lasts about ten days. The farmers sell their harvest to tea shops for the purpose of scenting tea leaves to enhance their fragrance. The price of this jasmine ranges from dozens to over a hundred yuan per hundred catties. In recent years, Changle County has also grown jasmine, but the fragrance produced is not as good as that of Minhou. Taiwan also grows jasmine, but its fragrance is even inferior to that of Changle. At the beginning of this summer, there was a lot of rain, and the streams rose six or seven times, so the jasmine in various villages, those in high places were drenched by the rain, and those in low places were submerged by the water. Therefore, the production of the first bloom was very small, and the selling price reached more than three hundred yuan per hundred catties. Recently, the jasmine in various places has been exposed to sunny and hot weather, and after the water receded, the soil has become more fertile. After the flower farmers sorted it out, the production of the second bloom suddenly became very prosperous. In the past ten days, it has been possible to produce about a thousand loads per day, especially in the past three days, the production has reached more than four thousand loads. Therefore, the selling price has dropped from more than sixty yuan per load to more than thirty yuan per load. Major tea shops have purchased more than ten thousand yuan worth of jasmine in these ten days, with some purchasing up to tens of thousands of yuan per day. In total, the flower farmers in various villages have earned more than ten thousand yuan per day in these ten days. Farmers after the disaster have been compensated for their losses, and all are happily elated. (July 30th)

### Wuxi Arrests Six Traitors

Long Tiyao, the county magistrate and commander of the 6th Security Brigade of this county, in order to prevent traitorous activities, strictly ordered his subordinates to pay attention to arresting them. At about 7:00 p.m. on the 30th, the soldiers of the second company of the brigade, while patrolling the railway near Wangting, saw a man about thirty years old wandering around and behaving suspiciously. They went forward to interrogate him, but he stuttered and denied everything. They found a Japanese copper coin and a small silk bag on him. They immediately took him to the team for temporary custody. At about 5:00 p.m. on the 31st, Deputy Officer Yan opened a court to interrogate him. According to his confession, his name is Yang Quanbao, from Henan, and he is engaged in destroying railways and spying on military intelligence. He is paid 20 yuan per month, which is paid in two installments. After obtaining the confession, Yan immediately transferred the suspect to the county government for interrogation, as the suspect was indeed a traitor. At the same time, the team also found three suspected traitors, including Ye Xiaosanz, on the railway near Wangting.

### Hefei Huainan Road Will Be Extended

Various public organizations in Shouxian County believe that the cultural relics and terrain of the county are of great importance, but inconvenient transportation has led to a surplus of agricultural products and a decline in commerce. They have repeatedly submitted requests to the Ministry of Railways and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau to build a branch line from Bengbu to Shou, but due to various reasons, it has not been realized. Now, various public organizations believe that the Huainan Road is very close to the county (the northern terminus, Tianjia'an, is 90 li from Shou). If the Huainan Road is extended from Tianjia'an to Shouxian County, it will be easy to do, and the funds will be more abundant since the road was changed to commercial operation on July 1st. Therefore, they specially appointed Xu Zhengxin, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and Sun Youcheng, chairman of the Red Cross Society, as representatives to meet with Director Hu and General Manager Cheng of the Huainan Road Bureau at Jiulonggang to apply for the extension of the Huainan Road from Tianjia'an to Shouxian County. Director Hu agreed to send personnel to investigate and measure in the near future. If there are no major projects, he decided to extend the road to Zhengyangguan to facilitate transportation in Shouxian County and western Anhui and eastern Henan. The two representatives, Xu and Sun, have returned satisfied, and it is reported that the survey and measurement personnel will be sent out to work soon.

### Raising Burlap Sacks to Aid the Army

All circles in Hefei held an Anti-Enemy Support Association at the county party headquarters at 9:00 a.m. on the 29th to discuss monetary and material assistance. All circles also decided to prepare 10,000 burlap sacks in this county for the purpose of strengthening national defense. The county chamber of commerce specially donated 1,000 sacks in advance to promote the cause.

### Well-Known Bandit of Changzhou Apprehended in Shanghai

Chen Qi, the captain of the detective team of Wujin County, previously received a secret order from the county government to apprehend a well-known bandit named Zhou Quanliang (also known as Ai Quanlin). He immediately sent detective Zhang Yuanxin and others to Shanghai to investigate and arrest him according to the address. He soon learned that the bandit had changed his name to Shen Quanliang and was hiding in the Wang Fuyuan Tea House. He immediately brought back the informant Yang Da and, together with two detectives from the Gordon Road police station, went to the tea house and arrested Zhou Quanliang. After being interrogated by the special district court, Zhou hesitated to answer questions about the cases of coming to Changzhou with Tan Xianglin to commit robberies. Detective Zhang Yuanxin immediately returned to Changzhou and reported to the county government for verification. The county magistrate believed that Zhou Quanliang was indeed a famous bandit and immediately prepared a document together with the case file and ordered Captain Chen to go to Shanghai yesterday to submit it to the First Special District Court and escort the bandit back to Changzhou for trial.

### Xun (Police Patrol) Officer of Funing Resigns to Join the Army

Zhang Zezhong, a Xun (Police Patrol) officer of the Donggou Police Station in this county, was extremely angry that the Japanese army was arbitrarily occupying our land in the Hebei area. He then submitted his resignation to the county government on the 31st in order to go north to kill the enemy.

### Shaoxing Prepares to Organize Anti-Enemy Support Association

The county party headquarters is scheduled to convene representatives from various agencies, groups, and schools on August 2 to prepare for the organization of an anti-enemy support association to discuss propaganda during the future war and to handle all rear area work.

### City Chamber of Commerce Notice to All Industries: Prevent the Enemy from Obtaining Grain, Forage, and Metals

Prohibit Grain Transactions from Northeastern Ports. Flour Industry Strives to Store and Expand Warehouses

City Chamber of Commerce Notice

The City Chamber of Commerce, in order to prevent the enemy from obtaining grain, forage, and metals, yesterday issued a notice to all industry associations, stating: "Regarding the letter from the United Association of Citizens of the First Special District of this city, stating that the violent Japanese, in preparation for military supplies for invasion, have been using Chinese traitors and Japanese ruffians in various parts of our country for several months to collect and store grain, forage, and scrap metal, which is then trafficked for export for military use. If measures are not taken quickly to stop this, national defense will be further threatened. After discussion by the Fourth Executive Committee of this chamber, it was unanimously decided that this city, as a commercial port with a mixture of good and bad, is most likely to experience such incidents. Therefore, it was resolved to request the City Chamber of Commerce to instruct the various industry associations to strictly prevent any military supplies or raw materials related to national defense from being smuggled out of the country, in order to strengthen national defense. We hereby forward the resolution and request that you examine and implement it accordingly." Upon receipt, we found that although the government has already issued strict prohibitions on the export of metals, grain, and other related items, and has imposed restrictions, we are still concerned that evildoers may smuggle them out, and that even the most meticulous measures cannot prevent oversights. Therefore, we hereby issue this notice, urging all associations, for the sake of consolidating national defense and ensuring their own survival, to assist in supervision at all times and in all places, and to immediately report any observations or information truthfully. This is our sincere hope. We issue this special notice and wish you peace."

Grain Industry Resolution

The Grain and Oilseed Cake Association of this city, recognizing the current national crisis and in order to prevent fellow traders from transporting grain to aid the enemy, and to raise funds for national salvation to contribute to the country, held a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members at 4:00 PM yesterday at the association's office on Min'guo Road. Gu Xinyi, Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Cai Yukun, Yan Xiaoquan, and all other executive and supervisory members attended. Gu Xinyi presided, and Kong Rulin recorded the minutes. The following key resolutions were made: Fundraising plan for national salvation: (Resolution) Divide into two types: national salvation donations and national salvation savings. Regarding national salvation donations, the association will send letters to its eight affiliated organizations, urging all firms and individuals to donate as much as possible. Each organization must report the amount of pledged donations to the association within five days. As for the specific measures for national salvation savings, a separate committee will be formed to draft them and submit them to the association for approval and implementation. The committee will consist of fifteen members: Chen Shide, He Quansheng, He Xianggao, Chen Yuming, Gu Xinyi, Cai Yukun, Zhu Zixiang, Chen Ziyi, Yan Xiaoquan, Yang Heqing, Ye Tingfan, She Bingwen, Chuan Changyu, Jiang Hongbin, and Zhou Zhigang. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.

Expanding Flour Warehouses

The various flour mills in this city, in view of the country's difficulties, and since the government authorities have issued orders prohibiting the export of wheat, the grain industry should collectively take responsibility to store national food supplies for the people, in preparation for a long-term resistance. In the past month, in addition to striving to promote production, they have temporarily suspended export transactions from various ports in North China. According to information obtained by the reporter of the Shiye She from relevant sources yesterday, the various mills in this city, including Fuxin, Shenda, and Maoxin, have separately expanded their warehouses and are storing large quantities of flour as much as possible. They are generally refusing to fulfill orders for excessive amounts of spot goods from domestic and foreign trading firms, or any suspicious transactions. Small transactions, however, will be handled as usual.

Preventing Export of Scrap Iron

The Ironware Industry Association, the Scrap Metal Industry Association, the Ironware Parts Industry Association, the Foundry Industry Association, and the Blacksmith Industry Association of this city, in view of the recent outbreak of war in North China and the rise of traitors in this city who are secretly transporting scrap iron to aid the enemy, convened a joint meeting some time ago to discuss countermeasures. A decision was made and submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for implementation. It is now known that these associations have scheduled a second joint meeting for 2:00 PM on August 2nd, and have already issued a notice yesterday.

### Customs Implements Ministry Order Prohibiting Export of Pig Iron, etc.

The Jianghai Customs has issued a notice prohibiting the export of all iron products, and has also imposed strict regulations on the transshipment of flour. The two notices from the Jianghai Customs are recorded below.

### Shanghai Cultural Circle National Salvation Association Held First Council Meeting Yesterday

The Shanghai Cultural Circle National Salvation Association held its first council meeting yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM at the Yijia Chun Restaurant. Chairman Pan Gongzhan delivered a lengthy speech on the current situation and the responsibilities that the cultural circle should bear. Afterwards, standing directors were elected and key proposals were discussed. The details are recorded as follows:

Council Members Present

Including Pan Gongzhan, Wang Fuquan, Qian Junrui, Wang Yunwu, Zhang Dingfu, Ye Yifeng, Zhang Tianyi, Xu Huaisha, Zhou Hanmei, Hu Ziying, Ma Chonggan, Ouyang Yuqian, Sheng Cheng, He Liangyuan, Tao Yuande, Lu Shaoping, Shen Qiyu, Fan Zhongyun, Cui Liuyi, Jin Zeren, Xu Gongmei, Cai Chusheng, Li Liewen, Mao Dun, Tao Boxun, Song Zhizhuo, You Jing, A Ying, Hu Yuzhi, Zhang Zhirang, Shen Zijiu, Gu Zhizhong, Shen Tiancui, Yao Xinyao, Zeng Xubai, Zhou Jianbin, Tao Baichuan, Wu Kaixian, Yao Sufeng, Wu Han, Jin Zhonghua, Qian Yishi, Zhu Qinglai, Ying Yunwei, Gu Jiwu, Guan Lu, Chen Kecheng, Sun Zuji, Sa Kongliao, Lu Lihua, Ba Jin, Yan Esheng, and Zhang Zhixue, totaling over fifty people.

Chairman's Speech

Chairman Pan Gongzhan's speech briefly stated that the first council meeting of the Cultural Circle National Salvation Association is being held today at a time when the current situation is tense, which makes its significance even more important. In recent days, the general public may not have a deep understanding of the current situation, which has led to a feeling of anger on the one hand, and a sense of disappointment on the other. I believe that the gentlemen in the cultural circle have a clear understanding of the current situation and will not have this phenomenon. We must know that this war of resistance is actually a decisive battle for the life and death of the Chinese nation. It will not be a short-term event or something that can be concluded with one or two contacts. Now that the war of resistance has begun, it will definitely advance day by day. This does not necessarily refer to the advancement of the military's position, but rather to the advancement of the spirit and facts of the war of resistance. Because our country is being invaded and is forced to rise up to fight back. Chairman Chiang has instructed that we will never give in halfway. Gentlemen, seeing Chairman Chiang's speech today, and Chairman Chiang's report at the Gengshan Talks, it is clear that Chairman Chiang's attitude is resolute, and we really have no room for hesitation. In the past two days, the general public has been greatly disturbed and full of doubts when they heard the news of the sudden loss of Peiping and Tianjin. On the other hand, after receiving news of a small victory at the Ji'hao Bridge the day before yesterday, they were overjoyed and set off firecrackers. This is also a kind of impetuous mentality. Superficiality is definitely not enough to cope with a prolonged war. We, the advanced members of the cultural circle, must take responsibility for correcting this. The central government has already made a decision, but some people still doubt whether the central government is determined and ask why a full-scale war of resistance has not been launched. This is of course not surprising, because they simply do not understand war. War is a major national event, a major event for military experts. How can non-experts in strategy understand all the strategic plans of war? Since everyone does not understand the subtleties of military planning, they should not make irresponsible remarks about military affairs. This is more than just carrying coals to Newcastle. It must be known that this is a prolonged war, not a local war, and it is a war of resistance by a weak country that is forced to defend its life against a strong country, not a war between strong countries. It is possible that one day, a large piece of Chinese land will be lost, and half of our compatriots may even suffer tragic sacrifices. But this does not mean that we will stop fighting if we retreat, or surrender if we are defeated. We must have the determination to continue the war of resistance. At the final moment, not fighting is also a national demise. Fighting can still find a way to survive in the face of death. Therefore, once the war starts,

There is no possibility of peaceful coexistence or hope for peace. Since the central government has made a decision, we must not have doubts about military affairs. We must have absolute faith in the leader and the government. As long as the leader and the government are leading us in the war of resistance, whatever the leader and the government want us to do, we must go all out and sacrifice. Therefore, the current issue is whether we can believe in and obey the leader and the government. If, at this critical moment, ordinary people who do not understand military affairs are still doubting and making irresponsible remarks, they will definitely harm the country. I hope that the gentlemen in the cultural circle will first lead the people to absolutely believe in the leader and the government. First, we can learn from a recent mistake that the lack of unified spirit and will cannot be used to wage war. The defeat of the Twenty-ninth Army is glorious on the one hand, and painful on the other. The reason for the defeat is the incurable disease of "lack of unified spirit and will." The enemy used a divisive policy, trying every day to divide the Twenty-ninth Army from the central government, and then divide the internal parts of the Twenty-ninth Army. As a result, the senior cadres of the Twenty-ninth Army lacked unified spirit and will, and their actions could not be unified. Some wanted peace, others advocated war, indecisive, and waiting to die. If the will was unified and the spirit was unified, they would not have waited until the enemy had fully deployed before fighting back. Chairman Chiang had foreseen this. Now some people vaguely say that we want to resist, but at the same time, we want freedom of thought. Then, the likes of Yin Rugeng, Jiang Chaozong, and Qi Bianyuan, who want to be traitors, are they not also exercising freedom of thought? It must be known that under the firm war of resistance of the whole country, thought cannot be free. If everyone wants freedom of thought, then can a general still command the battle? Therefore, I hope that the gentlemen in the cultural circle will have a great awakening and abandon the individualistic principle of freedom of thought, and unify the spirit of the entire nation. Under this situation, if we do not have a great awakening, we will definitely plant the seeds of national subjugation. Under the lack of unified spirit and will, the Twenty-ninth Army has already made tragic sacrifices, and Peiping and Tianjin have been lost. Now it all depends on whether our entire nation can achieve the unity of national spirit and the unity of will, which can determine the future destiny of the country. Germany's final defeat in the European War was also due to the lack of unity of national spirit. In General Ludendorff's book "Total War," it is described in detail. I hope that people in the cultural circle will use our mouths and our pens to awaken the general public and let them know the value of unified national spirit and will, otherwise it will be tantamount to suicide and self-destruction. Third, the process of completing the great cause of the Chinese national rejuvenation must be learned from Turkey. Westerners used to say that Turkey was the sick man of the Near East, and we were the sick man of the Far East. But Turkey is now rejuvenated. Turkey participated in the European War and was one of the defeated countries. The Turkish capital, Constantinople, had already fallen under the iron heel of the enemy. After the European War, not only the capital but even half of the country's land was occupied by others. However, the Turkish Youth National Party rose up to oppose the humiliating peace treaty signed by the Constantinople government. They absolutely believed in a leader, General Kemal, and moved the capital to Angora in the interior. Within a few years, they commanded the army to counterattack, defeated the Greek army, and even Britain and France did not dare to move. At the First Lausanne Conference, Turkey sent Prime Minister Ismet to attend as a representative. He put forward basic conditions such as abolishing unequal treaties and withdrawing foreign troops. Britain did not agree, and the Turkish representative returned to the country to fight again. The Greek army was defeated, and the peace conference was reopened. Britain, France, and other countries agreed to Turkey's demands, and Turkey was rejuvenated and became an independent, equal, and free country. This was entirely due to several years of hard struggle.

Unified Spirit

As a result, the Chinese people must also have this determination. Even if our land and people have sacrificed an unknown amount, as long as a part of the land and population continues to resist, and does not yield for a long time, the final victory will ultimately belong to us. If we shout for resistance on the one hand, and plan to escape or reduce sacrifices on the other, it is tantamount to advocating war and wanting peace at the same time, and it is inevitable that the country will be subjugated and surrendered. We must now inspect the compatriots across the country to see if everyone has the determination to die, and if everyone has a unified belief. If everyone has the determination to die and a unified belief, we will definitely win. Therefore, China must learn from Turkey and persevere, not surrender, not compromise, not be discouraged, not be arrogant, and be united as a whole, absolutely believing in Chairman Chiang as the commander-in-chief of the unified war of resistance, and always obey his orders. China will definitely be able to rejuvenate.

Election of Standing Directors

Then, the discussion began: ㊀ Election of standing directors. It was resolved to elect Pan Gongzhan, Zhou Jianyun, Zhang Zhirang, Zhou Hanmei, Xie Liuyi, Shen Zijiu, Tao Baichuan, Sa Kongliao, Gu Zhizhong, Cai Chusheng, Ouyang Maoqian, Zhu Qinglai, Ye Lingfeng, and Qian Junrui as the fifteen standing directors.

Discussion of Proposals

㊀ (Omitted) ㊁ Proposal to unite all sectors to effectively sanction traitors, ㊂ Proposal to assist the government in stepping up anti-smuggling work, ㊃ Proposal to launch a campaign to collect 100,000 gas masks. It was resolved to send the above four proposals to the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association for handling. ㊄ Proposal to join the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association, ㊅ Proposal to request the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association to immediately convene a citizens' assembly within one week based on the association's resolutions, ㊆ Proposal to request the Central Propaganda Department to encourage patriotic speeches, ㊇ Proposal to publish the association's newsletter, ㊈ Proposal to organize a field service group to the war zone in the north, ㊉ Proposal to launch a joint performance by various theater troupes to raise funds to comfort the soldiers fighting against the enemy, ㊉㊀ Proposal to organize an international publicity committee, ㊉㊁ Proposal to mobilize the cultural circle in this city to expand publicity. It was resolved to hand over the above eight proposals to the Standing Committee for handling. ㊉㊂ In view of the critical situation of the fall of Peiping and Tianjin, the Association should issue a declaration to encourage the people and consolidate the foundation for resistance. It was resolved to invite Zhang Tianyi, Li Liewen, Jin Zhonghua, Qian Junrui, Tao Kangde, Zhang Dingfu, Sun Zuji, and He Jingyuan to draft it, and Hu Yuzhi and Zhou Hanmei to review it before publication. ㊉㊃ How should the association express its support when Shen Junru is released from prison? It was resolved to combine the date and location of the banquet for Guo Moruo and hand it over to the Standing Committee for decision.

### Mobilization of All Sectors for National Salvation Work

Actively Raise National Defense Donations and Prepare for Long-Term Resistance

With the change in the situation in Peiping and Tianjin, and the opening of the war of resistance, all sectors of this city, in order to express their determination to coexist with the country and wage a desperate war against the enemy, have launched a campaign to raise national defense donations to strengthen their resistance forces. The Xin Xin She reporter has compiled the preparations of various groups as follows:

### Regarding the Case of Speculation in Cotton Yarn, Sheng Enyi and Wu Qiding Will Not Be Prosecuted

Believed to be Mere Rumors and Gossip, Insufficient as Evidence of Criminal Offense

Sheng Enyi and Wu Qiding, who were investigated by the court due to the speculation in cotton yarn, have now been decided by the prosecutor of the First Special District Court not to be prosecuted. The original text of the decision of non-prosecution is recorded as follows:

Decision of Non-Prosecution by the Prosecutor of the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Court. Defendant: Sheng Enyi, male, 30 years old, native of Wujin, Jiangsu, Director of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau, residing at 516 Long'an Temple Road.

Wu Qiding, male, 46 years old, native of Cixi, Zhejiang, Director of the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, residing at 52 Masnan Road.

Regarding the aforementioned defendants, the case of suspected dereliction of duty No. 19 of the 25th year of the Republic of China has been fully investigated. It is deemed that they should not be prosecuted. The reasons are specifically stated as follows:

In May of the 26th year of the Republic of China, the price of cotton yarn at the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Yarn Exchange soared. At the end of the month, there was a wave of speculation. On June 8th and 9th, the market was in chaos due to the sharp increase in prices, resulting in the suspension of auctions and market closures. Subsequently, Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, together with representatives of the Central Party Headquarters and the Control Yuan, came to conduct a thorough investigation and believed that there were public officials colluding to manipulate and profit. The current public officials, such as the defendants, were suspected of violating Article 134 of the Criminal Law and Articles 49 and 52 of the Exchange Law. The Ministry of Industry submitted a letter to this court, along with a list of evidence, requesting transfer to the court. After careful investigation, the suspicion of the defendants committing crimes is insufficient, and they should not be prosecuted according to law. The following is a separate explanation:

㊀ Wu Qiding's Part

When the Ministry of Industry inspected the relevant account books of brokers and firms, it was found in the client ledger of Yuanda Securities Firm under the name "Yuanji Jia" that there were words such as "Dai Xinghua representing Wu Qiding." It is evident that Wu Qiding has a considerable relationship with the name "Yuanji Jia." Although the witness Dai Xinghua testified that "Yuanji Jia" is his personal account name, and the manager of Yuanda Firm, Yang Yuankai, also said that he added Wu Qiding's name under Dai Xinghua's to facilitate investigation, the statements of these witnesses either contradict the records or are contrary to reason. They are suspected of deliberately exonerating the defendant and are not sufficient to be adopted. However, Yuanda Firm is a broker of the securities exchange, and the name "Yuanji Jia" is recorded in the securities client ledger. Dai Xinghua and Yang Yuankai stated that "Yuanji Jia" is the account name for buying and selling securities and submitted a notice of Yuanji Jia buying and selling government bonds as evidence (see the investigation record and attached documents No. 2), which is still credible. Even if "Yuanji Jia" is the account name of the defendant Wu Qiding, the transactions are limited to securities and not cotton yarn trading. At most, it would only raise the question of whether Article 49 of the Exchange Law has been violated and whether an administrative fine should be imposed, which is obviously irrelevant to the cotton yarn exchange speculation. When the prosecutor, accompanied by an accountant, investigated bills at various banks, no facts unfavorable to the defendant were found. In addition, there is no other evidence sufficient to determine that the defendant directly or indirectly spread rumors or used tricks to intentionally change the market price of the exchange. The suspicion of committing a crime is obviously insufficient.

㊁ Sheng Enyi's Part

The Ministry of Industry stated that the defendant Sheng Enyi is an important figure in the cotton yarn exchange speculation, based solely on the fact that such rumors were circulating in the market. Witnesses Mu Xiangyue, Wang Xiaolai, and Yu Qiaqing also stated in court that there were such rumors. These witnesses are all respected figures in society, and their words should be credible. It is evident that there were indeed such rumors in the market, and they are not fabricated. However, according to rumors and hearsay, the evidentiary power is inherently weak, and it is insufficient as a basis for determining criminal suspicion. Moreover, after inquiring from witnesses Mu Xiangyue and others about which broker Sheng Enyi entrusted to conduct transactions and the amount of transactions, and who the rumor spreaders were, except for Mu Xiangyue who said it was said by Xian Lanting, who then denied it in court, the witnesses could not clearly point out the details. Although witness Yu Qiaqing stated that there were rumors of a secret organization called the Seven Star Company manipulating the exchange market, and Sheng Enyi seemed to be related to the company, when asked who organized the Seven Star Company, what its contents were, and what Sheng Enyi's relationship with the company was, Yu Qiaqing said that the Seven Star Company was a recently rumored term, and he did not know who organized it or other details. He also said that because it was rumored that Sheng Enyi was a large bull trader, he presumed that he was related to the company. Furthermore, witness Shao Wenmei stated in the investigation that it was rumored that broker No. 27 was trading on behalf of the Sheng family, and broker No. 57 was also likely involved. When the Ministry of Industry sent personnel to investigate on July 4th, Wang Suizhi, the manager of Yuan Mao Yong, stated that it was rumored in the market that brokers No. 27, No. 57, No. 15, and No. 35 had all traded on behalf of the Sheng family. After examining the client transaction account books and client settlement account books of the aforementioned brokers, there were no records of Sheng Enyi or his regular trade name (Shuzhe Hall). The prosecutor, accompanied by accountant Li Ding, went to local Chinese and foreign banks to separately check the sources of the bills delivered by brokers who were suspected of trading cotton yarn on behalf of Sheng Enyi, as recorded in the exchange's bill receipt books for April, May, and before June 8th of this year, and the results were all unrelated to Sheng Enyi (see accountant Li Ding's report). Moreover, the clients Sheng Ying Ji and Hui Ji of broker No. 27 were account names used by Miss Sheng Wu, and the receipts and payments were directly negotiated with Miss Sheng Wu. The account names Jinru Ji, Ai Ji, Yuru Ji, Kangjin Ji, and Jin Ji of broker No. 57 were account names used by Miss Sheng Qi and her husband, Zhuang Jin. Broker Chen Kangshan of No. 27 and Sun Yufeng, the representative of broker No. 57, respectively stated this (see the Ministry of Industry's record of questioning broker Chen Kangshan of No. 27 and Sun Yufeng, the representative of broker No. 57, and the investigation record). Although Miss Sheng Wu and Miss Sheng Qi are both sisters of Sheng Enyi, they have both been married for many years, and their trading activities cannot be said to be related to Sheng Enyi. As for the fact that the Englishman Anderson entrusted Dong Ransun, the manager of Chengda Firm, to conduct transactions, Chen Yu, a counselor of the Ministry of Industry, and Yan Shenyu, a director, and Kuang Yunwen, a section chief, investigated separately on June 19th and July 6th. Anderson claimed that he bought 11,500 bales on June 8th, which he did himself and had not done cotton yarn trading before. Dong Zaisun stated during the investigation by the Social Bureau that the 300,000 yuan of margin received by Yu Da on June 9th was advanced by Chengda, and that Anderson had cooperated with Miss Sheng Wu on June 8th to trade 10,000 bales. This does not entirely match the check submitted by Anderson to the Ministry of Industry on July 6th, which was paid by the Hongkou Branch of the Shanghai Bank. Although there are doubts in this, it has not been found that the defendant falsely used Anderson's name to privately trade cotton yarn. Moreover, the prosecutor, accompanied by accountant Li Ding, went to the Hongkou Branch of the Shanghai Bank to check the checks paid by the bank as recorded in the exchange's bill receipt books for April, May, and before June 8th of this year. The check was not issued by the defendant and was not inconsistent. It should not be inferred from outsiders. Taking into account the above circumstances, in addition to the so-called rumors and hearsay, there is no evidence to determine that the defendant is suspected of committing a crime. According to the results of the investigation and evidence in the investigation, the defendant's part cannot be considered to have reached the degree that prosecution should be initiated.

In summary, the defendants' suspicion of committing crimes is insufficient. Therefore, in accordance with Article 231, paragraph 10, and Article 234 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the decision of non-prosecution is made as follows:

July 28th, 26th year of the Republic of China, stamped by Song Genshan, Prosecutor of the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Court.

This copy is certified to be identical to the original, stamped by Han Shuzhi, Clerk of the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Court Prosecutor's Office, July 30th, 26th year of the Republic of China.

### Important News from Various Exchanges

Securities Exchange Plans to Auction Corporate Bonds

In order to circulate funds and develop business, the board of directors of the Chinese Securities Exchange has decided to establish a corporate bond market on the second floor of the exchange to auction various corporate bonds and bonds issued by the Ministry of Railways at home and abroad. It has been two months since preparations began. A reporter from Dagong News specifically interviewed Chen Jisun, the director of general affairs of the exchange. According to him, the Chinese industry has historically had difficulty circulating funds, so it has been difficult to fully develop in business. In recent years, it has become imperative for the funds of various companies to be fully circulated. The exchange originally had this plan, but it was delayed due to capital limitations. Now, the extraordinary shareholders' meeting has resolved to increase a large amount of capital, so it has begun to arrange various market facilities and engage in research on auction rules and regulations. If there are no major changes in the situation, it is expected to be implemented in three days.

Securities Exchange Changes to New Bookkeeping

The Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange previously changed to new bookkeeping, which was complicated and unfamiliar. In order to practice, the Brokerage Association specifically submitted a request to the board of directors to suspend the market for two days. It is now known that the practice has been completed, and it has been decided that starting this month, all brokers' records of transactions and entries of transaction accounts will uniformly adopt the new bookkeeping format as required by the exchange.

Smoke and flames filled the air, and the fire was very fierce. Fortunately, the police officer on duty at the station was informed and reported to the station. He immediately called the fire department and drove a water truck to the scene to put out the fire. It was not extinguished until after 2:00 PM, resulting in the burning of a storeroom of the Unified Silk Factory in the west, as well as ten buildings from No. 51 to No. 61 and from No. 66 to No. 74 on the opposite side, and about twenty thatched sheds and lead-skin houses in the back, for a total of about forty houses, with huge losses. Also, a fire was reported on Song Park Road at around 2:00 PM in the afternoon. Fire trucks from various sections rushed to put out the fire, and a total of four thatched sheds were burned down.

### Eighty-One-Year-Old Woman Accuses Daughter-in-Law of Bullying

Son and Daughter-in-Law Have Been Separated for More Than Ten Years, Court Rules the Case Inadmissible

Guangdong woman Zheng Guweiying, residing at No. 451 Hong'an Lane, Laobazi Road, is 81 years old. Recently, she filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing her daughter-in-law Zheng Tang Peifang (53 years old, residing at No. 537 Taiping Lane, Wuchang Road) of

Relying on Wealth to Bully

Destroying the Five Relationships, Disrespecting Elders, Abusing Her Husband, Hiding Her Great-Grandson, and Intending to Abandon, etc. The reasons for her lawsuit are briefly stated as follows: The plaintiff married the eldest daughter of Tang Zhiren (Zhongliang), the defendant, as her daughter-in-law in November of the 15th year of Guangxu. They had one son and one daughter. The daughter, Likun, has passed away. The son, Guohong, is alive and has married and had four daughters. Unfortunately, the young great-granddaughter, Minsheng, died in May. She ordered her son, Richang (Pengzhou), to go to the Tang residence at No. 527 Wuchang Road to bring the defendant home. However, the defendant did not recognize her husband and said, "Who are you? I don't know you." Her son went home and told her, but Mrs. Zhao did not believe it. Since the defendant had been married to her husband for more than thirty years and had children and grandchildren, why would she say she didn't know him? She ordered her son to go again, but unexpectedly, he was instigated by the defendant and more than ten male and female servants to beat and drive him away. He reported to the Hongkou Police Station. Later, her son's internal injuries took two months to heal at home. She also said that she had not seen her great-grandson and granddaughter-in-law Mai since her son was beaten more than two months ago. She went to her grandson's residence at No. 10 Taiqing Lane, Fusheng Road, to inquire, but they had already left. It was said that they had been hidden by the defendant, or that they had been harmed. She is old and sick and needs the service of her children and grandchildren. The pain of her only son being injured has not been relieved, and the worry of her great-grandchildren being missing has increased. Therefore, she filed this lawsuit. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Dai Rongduo took the bench in the Fourth Criminal Court to summon the defendant and her lawyer, Lin Qingchi, to the court. The plaintiff, Zheng Guweiying, submitted the case, and because she was old and deaf, her son, Zheng Richang, stated the above situation on her behalf. The defendant stated that after she married the plaintiff's son, their relationship deteriorated. Later, because he owed money and fled, she returned to her mother's house and lived there for more than ten years. She never received a penny of comfort from her husband. On May 18th of this year, her husband went to her mother's house and roared in every possible way, accusing her father of owing him more than 20,000 yuan. She ignored him, and he rolled around on the ground, blew the whistle wildly, tore his clothes, and reported to the police station, accusing her of instigating the beating. In fact, she never instigated the servants to beat her husband. The purpose of this sudden criminal prosecution is because she learned that her father had passed away and thought that she had received a large inheritance, so she wanted to force her to go home so that she could pay for her support. Finally, her defense lawyer stated that most of these cases are private prosecution crimes. Since the plaintiff is not the direct victim, the procedure is inappropriate. Judge Dai reviewed the供词 and ruled in court that the case was not accepted.

### Russian Gatekeepers of the British Bank Fight Each Other

Suspecting Colleagues of Slandering After Being Suspended, No. 5 Russian Constable Seriously Wounded by Three Shots

The British Bank at No. 18 Bund has always employed two Russian gatekeeper constables, one being No. 3, named Aijing Ni'aisili Jitongke, and the other being No. 5, named Shimensi Tuolizhen. The two had a good relationship on weekdays, but recently, No. 3 was lazy in his work, which often caused him to be scolded by the Western manager, leading him to suspect that No. 5 was stirring up trouble. As a result, they became enemies, and the two often quarreled. At 7:10 AM yesterday, after No. 3 received his pistol from the police station, he went to work, but was informed by the bank that his position had been suspended by the manager. The constable suspected that this was also caused by the slander of Constable No. 5, and he was extremely angry. As he was walking out of the bank, he happened to meet No. 5. Unexpectedly, No. 3 suddenly took out the pistol he had prepared and fired a shot at No. 5, hitting him in the chest. After being shot, No. 5 rushed forward and grabbed No. 3. No. 3 then fired two more shots, one hitting his arm and the other hitting his head. However, although No. 5 was shot in three places, he still struggled to snatch the pistol from No. 3 before falling to the ground. No. 3 then tried to escape. At that time, a special constable, Zhang Haoqing, passed by and followed him. When he reached the Bund on Fuzhou Road, he saw Western Police Chief Hui Tuo coming towards him. Zhang went forward to report and arrested the Constable No. 3 and took him back to the police station. Hua detectives Chuan Jinfu and others sent No. 5 to the public hospital for serious injuries. At 11:00 AM, the police station sent No. 3 to the hospital for treatment. After the doctor's examination, it was found that the injuries were serious, and he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Criminal Court Chief Qian Hongye took the bench to interrogate him. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the police station, stated the previous situation, saying that it was difficult to predict when the injured person would recover, and the defendant had fully confessed in the police station. The case is now requested to be postponed for one week to see how the injured person's injuries are. When questioned, Aijing Ni'aisili Jitongke fully confessed. Judge Qian reviewed the matter and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for one week.

### Marital Discord Leads Neighbors to Request Legal Action

He Qinghua, a native of Ningbo and owner of Ruiluxing Cotton Cloth Store, located at No. 6, Jifuli, Lane 457, Ningbo Road, is 31 years old. He previously married a Ms. Xu, with whom he had two sons. After Ms. Xu passed away from illness, he married Peng Shujuan, a woman from Nantong (23 years old), during the 6th group wedding organized by the municipal government on February 5th of last year. They immediately cohabited in the store. Recently, because He sought pleasure outside their marriage, Ms. Peng repeatedly tried to dissuade him, which angered He. On the evening of July 9th at 9 PM, another conflict arose. He violently beat her, causing injuries.

The Patrol Room also filed a public prosecution against He. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Fengqi of the First Special Court opened the Second Criminal Court for interrogation. He, accompanied by his defense lawyer Wang Xintang, appeared in court. Ms. Peng also engaged Lawyer Chen to file a supplementary civil suit, seeking repayment of medical expenses and other funds totaling 68 yuan. First, Patrol Room Lawyer Jiang Baolian presented the circumstances, initiating prosecution under Article 277, Item 1 of the Criminal Law, and stated that the defendant claimed at the Patrol Room that Peng had mistreated his late wife's son, leading to the quarrel. Subsequently, Ms. Peng submitted a petition detailing the injuries she sustained. When questioned, He Qinghua admitted to verbal disputes but denied causing any injuries. The court attempted to mediate a reconciliation, but Peng Shujuan stated that the pain she had endured was too great, and she was unwilling to reconcile. After questioning by Judge Zhan, the case was adjourned for further hearing.

### In Memory of Generals Tong and Zhao and the Martyred Soldiers

— Bao Lu

"Zhao Dengyu, Commander of the 132nd Division of the 29th Army, and Tong Lingge, Deputy Commander of the 29th Army and Director of the Training Regiment, have had their remains recovered. They were jointly coffined on the 30th, and their coffins are temporarily placed at Longquan Temple. According to Zhao's guard who returned to Beiping, during the intense battle, Commander Zhao was directing operations near Tuanhe when he was suddenly hit by a bullet, injuring his left arm. I wanted to carry him back, but the commander refused and continued to advance. Shortly after, his leg and shoulder were also injured. I urged the commander to retreat, but the commander said to me, 'Return to Beiping as quickly as possible and tell my mother: "Loyalty and filial piety cannot both be fulfilled. If I am unfortunate, please tell my mother not to grieve."' I tried to persuade him, but he refused, so I had no choice but to return to Beiping to report to the Commander's mother at her residence in Xin Temple Hutong, and after that, I did not know any further news. It is also heard that Deputy Commander Tong was on the front line when his legs were shot by machine gun fire. Tong, who was running at the time, fell forward, and a shell hit his head, resulting in his death." (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)

"The current situation in Beiping and Tianjin, such a transformation, was anticipated by informed people in the country," but five thousand soldiers and Generals Tong and Zhao died in the disaster. How tragic!

Because of the martyrdom of Generals Tong and Zhao and other soldiers, we cannot help but think of Yue Wu Mu. Commander Zhao said to his guard before his death, “Return to Beiping as quickly as possible and tell my mother: 'Loyalty and filial piety cannot both be fulfilled. If I am unfortunate, please tell my mother not to grieve.'” This is like Yue Wu Mu's tone. Seeing the situation of the Southern Song Dynasty before us, we really do not have time to be moved to tears by General Zhao's tragic death, but also feel sad for ourselves who are still alive!

Yue Wu Mu and his soldiers did not perish at the hands of the Jin soldiers but collapsed at the hands of internal traitors. Everyone still regards this as a regret. Yue Wu Mu's foolish loyalty has now become a regret for informed people. Of course, it is foolish, but his tragic death and his awe-inspiring spirit were enough to shock heaven and earth and make ghosts and gods cry, and will last forever!

Therefore, in terms of Generals Tong and Zhao and other martyred soldiers, they died in the right place and have no regrets. For us who are still alive, we really cannot ignore the traitors of today! This is not only enough for the people of the country to repay Generals Tong and Zhao, but also for our Yue Wu Mu in the future.

The Jin soldiers are about to cross the river, those who are still immersed in the dream of temporary peace, wake up!

### After Bitterness

— Ma Jia

Really, when you hear the sudden bad news: "Our army has withdrawn from Fengtai"! The Japanese army counterattacked Langfang only yesterday with extreme joy, but in a few hours, it changed so quickly, so quickly that it was almost mysterious. At this time, how can you not lose your mind and rely only on your own feelings, like a thousand unbridled horses galloping, making all kinds of crazy appearances that lose their normal state, crying! Stomping your feet! Sometimes it's even shameful to think about suicide"!

At that time, the four of us young people, after reading the newspaper, were indeed in that kind of crazy state. We all hung our heads low and didn't see each other, and we didn't pay attention to each other for a full twenty minutes. In these twenty minutes, the blood in our bodies boiled like magma before a volcanic eruption. Our eyes were on fire, and we wanted to smash everything in front of us to the ground. Xiao Zhu was the first to do it. In our sorrowful silence, he threw his beloved teacup to the floor. At first, we were startled, but later, when everyone's eyes focused on the shattered teacup, strangely enough, we all felt a very pleasant stream of emotion rushing through our cold hearts. A Huang even gritted his teeth and shouted

### Constipation Harms Health

We eat three meals a day and must defecate once a day so that the waste in the body is not stored and the blood flows naturally, making us feel more energetic. On the contrary, the residue accumulates in the intestines and often creates toxins, harming our health. If you take one or two "Weilun Run Chang Wan" pills a day, you can achieve natural defecation every day, because the pills are made from plant extracts and refined with their effective ingredients, so the efficacy is guaranteed and there are no drawbacks. Each bottle of 30 pills is priced at 24 cents, distributed by Zhengwei Pharmacy.

:

"Damn it! Dealing with our enemies, like this teacup shattering, is so simple! But!"

A Huang's throat choked up. I didn't say anything, I just pondered, "Isn't it? Fengtai was recovered all at once, and Langfang was also recovered all at once. Of course, as long as it's all at once, the Japanese army will be completely driven out of North China, that would be so simple! But it just so happens—" I didn't dare to think any further.

I squinted to look at Lao Peng. Lao Peng was much colder than us. He was the same as usual. His face, which had never had any expression, was now flat, like a philosopher, like he was pondering some mysterious and unanswerable thing. His eyes were dully staring at the woodcut on the wall in front of him, and his legs were shaking. I couldn't stand his coldness, and I almost scolded him when I asked him:

"Lao Peng! Do you have any emotions at all?"

Lao Peng only glanced at me casually, and then, as usual, slowly said:

"Ma Jia! To be honest, I am from Hunan. Since I was a child, I have lived an inhuman life. I have traveled through seven or eight provinces. I have tasted almost all the sufferings in the world. How could I not have emotions? It's just that my emotions are often overcome by my reason, and I deeply think about a certain phenomenon in front of me! Ma Jia! To be honest, when I took the newspaper from the vendor, I was a hundred times more upset than you. I saw that you were in a crazy state, and I did shed tears. But now, I am calm."

Xiao Zhu and A Huang both turned around and listened to Lao Peng's heavy words. He is calm now, and we are much calmer too. Seeing Lao Peng's gloomy attitude and hearing his heavy conversation, people will feel half-hearted. Lao Peng looked at us without saying anything. Maybe he saw that we were recovering, but he said heavily, like an old man reprimanding impetuous young people:

"Friends! When there is something that deserves your excitement, you should restrain your emotions; but when there are facts that make us sad, we have to ask Mr. Reason to think about it carefully for us."

Damn it! Isn't he really putting on the face of a senior to reprimand us? I turned my head to look at Xiao Zhu and A Huang, and I saw that their eyes were emitting an expression of disdain to pay attention to Lao Peng's words. I simply wanted to shout directly at him and ask him not to say such senior-like things anymore! But I didn't shout it out after all. How about Xiao Zhu and A Huang? They didn't say anything either. I just felt that Lao Peng's words made a lot of sense. Lao Peng probably caught our weakness, and he said again:

"Friends! Of course, you all know that the problem between China and Japan has reached the stage of settlement today, but this is a great historical process! We have all read history. For example, let's take the world of Wells in the UK. From the time when there were no humans, it is narrated directly to today's human society, with only about a thousand pages. We can read it in half a month, but this is the history of thousands of years! The settlement of the China-Japan problem today may only be a few pages in the historical record, but in our reality, it is definitely not a matter of a day or two!"

What else can we say to refute Lao Peng? Although Lao Peng's expression made us feel a little uncomfortable, his words were not wrong at all. Why should we be so emotional? Extreme happiness, until extreme bitterness. Lao Peng's words are right, the settlement of the China-Japan problem is definitely not a matter of a day or two in our reality!

After a while, we all recovered. We picked up the newspaper that A Huang had kicked to pieces, and we quietly read the newspaper again.

An hour later, A Huang said: "I have to learn about rescue work no matter what. Would I be discouraged by a small setback in our military?"

Xiao Zhu also said that he wanted to go to a friend who was participating in citizen training to ask for help, and he also wanted to go to military training. As for me, of course I want to reread the few journalism books I read before, and of course, I have to find a way to practice on the front line, if possible.

Bitterness is only a temporary emotional effect. After this emotional effect, I believe that there will be no more of that foolishness in the future. This can also be said to be a lesson.

### Launch Our Full-Scale War of Resistance

— Ke Yu

A full-scale war of resistance has begun! This is a decisive battle for the survival of our nation! We should have the following understanding of the full-scale war of resistance:

A full-scale war of resistance is a war of resistance launched by concentrating the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of the entire country.

A full-scale war of resistance is a war of resistance in which there is no distinction between north and south, and no distinction between old and young, and which is carried out quickly.

A full-scale war of resistance is a war of resistance under the consciousness of "determination to sacrifice and resist the enemy to the end."

A full-scale war of resistance is a prolonged and prepared war of resistance.

During the full-scale war of resistance, we should all be tense, always tense, and everywhere tense. We must not have selfish psychology or a lucky mentality. All our people should have a calm and composed spirit to cope with all future events. During this period, our "minds should be calm, measures should be prudent, do not be afraid of things, do not cause things, think about the safety of the overall situation, plan for the interests of the whole people, do not just know the immediate worries, but ignore long-term considerations." During this period, we should "clench our teeth, hold on to our goals, be compassionate and resolute, and all mental and financial resources are elements of revival, and should be cherished and not wasted." — Mayor Yu's words.

A full-scale war of resistance should be launched in all aspects and developed in all aspects:

Ourselves —

㊀ Prepare all the resources and materials to contribute to the country.

㊁ Prepare all the knowledge and skills to be used by the country.

㊂ Enrich our wartime common sense such as air defense and poison prevention.

Everyone —

㊀ Organize comfort teams, rescue teams, and singing teams to go to the front line to give comfort and encouragement to our army.

㊁ Launch a larger patriotic propaganda and fundraising campaign.

㊂ Automatically join the volunteer strongmen's team as the backbone of the full-scale war of resistance.

Government —

㊀ Issue an emergency mobilization order to the national army so that they can go to the front line to kill the enemy at any time.

㊁ Determine our military, political, economic, cultural, and diplomatic policies for the war of resistance.

㊂ Listen to and accept the opinions of the people in the opposition.

㊃ Actively organize the masses and open up the mass patriotic movement, so that the anti-enemy forces throughout the country are more firmly united and widely developed.

Launch our full-scale war of resistance! In the days to come, we should do our best for the country. We are not afraid of any hardships and sacrifices. We have many difficult days ahead, and everyone needs to face them firmly. Today, we only recognize the goal of saving the nation and seeking survival, and we are determined to save ourselves. We will devote all our efforts to defending the nation's war of resistance. We will not say more, but "how to put it into practice"!
