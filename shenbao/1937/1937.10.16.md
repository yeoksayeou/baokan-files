Central News Agency Special Correspondent with the Army in Zhabei, 1:30 AM, 16th Report: ⑴ After our army in Zhabei launched a large-scale counterattack on the night of the 14th, it has completely controlled North Sichuan Road. The intersections of all side roads along North Sichuan Road were originally enemy defense positions, fortified with sandbags and entrenchments. Now, all have been occupied by our forces. Consequently, the enemy forces that previously moved freely along North Sichuan Road are now under our threat and dare not act. Yesterday, enemy aircraft bombed the Zhabei area intensely. Our army anticipated that the enemy would launch a counterattack and strictly ordered the newly occupied positions to be on high alert. As expected, enemy tanks began moving at 11 PM last night. Contact was immediately made by forward outposts. By midnight, the sound of machine guns and rifles intensified. At the time of this report, fierce fighting was still ongoing. Our army holds a decisive advantage. ⑵ On the Baziqiao front, our army used a small force at 9 PM last night to launch a probe attack on the enemy positions around the 63rd Garden. Simultaneously, our direct-fire artillery bombarded the enemy's tank concentration area. After two hours of intense fighting, the enemy vehicles were forced to move in two directions due to the power of our artillery fire. Our infantry also returned to their defensive positions. ⑶ On Jiangwan Road, there were also more than a dozen minor engagements last night. There were no changes to either side's positions. ⑷ The enemy at the Sijing Ballfield, numbering over four thousand, launched a full-scale attack on Xianshui Temple yesterday, attempting to encroach on Miaohang. Our army bravely resisted, and the intensity of the fighting was unprecedented in recent days. However, after a day of intense combat, our lines remained steadfast. ⑸ North of Miaohang and south of Wenzaobang, our army originally held an advantage. Yesterday, after our army charged and engaged the enemy, we surrounded and severely attacked Caojiazhai. The enemy suffered over two hundred casualties. The enemy forces west of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway in the Heida Huangzhai area hurriedly constructed fortifications along the highway. Our artillery heavily bombarded them, destroying everything. Around 10 PM, over one hundred and twenty enemy soldiers were killed, and they could not withstand the attack and retreated.

### Our Forces Control New Positions on North Sichuan Road

Central News Agency Special Correspondent with the Army in Zhabei, 12 PM, 15th Report: Our army's counterattack toward North Sichuan Road last night was quite successful. After achieving the predetermined objectives, we withdrew our troops. However, the middle section of the road is entirely under our control. The enemy, unwilling to accept the breakthrough of their positions by our forces, redeployed reinforcements and launched a counterattack from various street entrances on the eastern section of the road at 4:30 AM this morning (15th). Street fighting raged for three hours, and the enemy made no progress. Our army still controls the new positions. Military sources also report that after 6 PM last night, our army launched attacks from multiple routes in Zhabei, Baoshan Road, Tiantong'an, and Baziqiao, with the aim of probing the enemy's strength. After our army forced the enemy forward outposts to retreat, we advanced into the enemy's first line of defense. The enemy forces responded in panic and were in a terrible state. After some time, having achieved our objectives, we withdrew to our original lines. Many enemy soldiers were killed in this operation.

Central News Agency Special Correspondent with the Army in Jiangwan, 12 PM, 15th Report: At 2:30 AM this morning (15th), the enemy forces lying dormant in the 63rd Garden suddenly rushed out and encroached on our Baziqiao positions. Our army engaged them briefly and then divided into two groups, flanking the enemy from Liuying Road and the west bank of the Hengbang River. The enemy lost their bearings and suffered about fifty casualties. By 5:30 AM, they retreated back to their original positions.

### Remnants of the Enemy Force South of Wenzaobang Attempt to Break Through, Suffered a Crushing Blow

Yesterday's attacks from multiple routes were met with heavy casualties

According to military sources yesterday, there had been contact at three locations along the south bank of Wenzaobang since the day before. The enemy east of the highway at Yanjiawan attempted to advance toward Miaohang but were repelled by our fierce attack. Our army west of the highway advanced from Bashiqiao House towards the enemy line at Sanfang House and Caojia House, driving the enemy towards the areas along the bank. Simultaneously, our forces bypassed to the north bank from the left flank, attacking their rear and cutting off their communications with other units. At the intersection of the highway and Wenzaobang south of Tangjiaqiao, our army held the Xiaoguzhai position. The enemy also attacked but were driven away by our repeated assaults. The enemy on the north bank, entrenched around Dunwusi Temple and Caitangzhai, also continuously harassed to the west. Our army held the west bank of a small river, blocking their advance, and our positions were exceptionally solid. The enemy's plan to attack Chenjiaxiang to the west and encroach on Nanxiang will ultimately fail.

Central News Agency Special Correspondent with the Army in Jiangwan, 3:30 PM, 15th Report: The remnant enemy forces south of Wenzaobang are still stubbornly attacking in a final desperate struggle. However, their attempts are in vain and only result in being killed by our forces. This morning (15th), over a dozen enemy aircraft flew over the area, observing for a long time, and then bombed our front lines. At the same time, enemy artillery also heavily bombarded the area. Around 8 AM, the enemy who had crossed the river from Jiangjiazhai launched a fierce attack, attempting to break through and link up with the remnant enemy forces at Gujiazhai. Simultaneously, the enemy at Gujiazhai also launched a fierce attack to the west as a coordinated effort. Our army was prepared and met the attacks separately, responding with ease. Around 10 AM, over a dozen small boats suddenly appeared on the Donglingjing River, fully loaded with enemy soldiers, heading towards the east bank, attempting to sneak across. Our army lay in ambush along the bank, and as they approached the middle of the river, we launched a concentrated bombardment with mortars and grenades. Our artillery fire was accurate, and four small boats were immediately sunk. Seeing the situation was not good, the enemy scrambled to escape towards the west bank. Our army then strafed them with machine guns and seized the opportunity to launch a counterattack. By noon, the enemy was overwhelmed and retreated in disarray. In this battle, over a hundred enemy soldiers were killed, and twice that number were wounded.

Central News Agency Special Correspondent with the Army in Jiangwan, 9:45 PM, 15th Report: The remnant enemy forces south of Wenzaobang, about one kilometer east of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, are surrounded by our forces in the Zhujiazhai and Huayuanzhai areas along the bank. At 1:30 PM, they suddenly launched an attack southward with a battalion of soldiers towards our Shenjiawan House and Luzhai line. Enemy aircraft and artillery combined their firepower to suppress our positions. Our army calmly responded and seized the opportunity to leap out and counterattack, driving the enemy back wounded. At 3 PM, enemy artillery began bombing again, covering their second attack, which was also repelled by us. At dusk, the enemy launched a third attack until the time of this report, the fierce fighting was still ongoing. Also, a portion of the enemy moved east around 4 PM, gathering at Zhangyuzhai and carrying river-crossing equipment, intending to cross the Donglingjing River. We immediately launched a head-on attack, and the enemy was caught off guard. Four or five hundred men were hit and fell into the water. The enemy lost their bearings and clashed with us in the river. Fierce fighting continued late into the night, and the enemy could not get close to the east bank.

### Enemy at Liuhang Encroached on Guangfu, Vigorously Attempted to Cross the River, All Suffering Miserable Defeats

Our Forces Killed the Enemy Company Commander at Xinluzhai, Many Casualties after Our Interception at Zhubeizhai

The enemy at Liuhang repeatedly attacked our Guangfu Town, but after being heavily defeated by our army, they once retreated to the Dijing and highway area. The enemy's ambition was not dead, and they repeatedly attacked again, but were all met with head-on defeats by our army's brave soldiers. After the enemy's frontal attacks failed, they switched to harassing from the north and south sides. Fierce fighting occurred around the Mengjiazhai, Laoluzhai, Chenjiazhai, and Zhoujiazhai areas north and south of Guangfu, but the enemy was still unable to succeed. Therefore, the enemy attempted to sneak across the Yangjing River in Guangfu to attack our army's rear, but our army's defenses were strict, and they could not fly across. The previous morning, an enemy company of about five to six hundred men attempted to sneak across near Xinluzhai, about 1,600 meters southeast of Guangfu. Our army discovered this, and even under the combined cover of enemy aircraft and artillery, our army still advanced and repelled them. Nearly a hundred were swept away by our army's machine guns. The enemy's 36th Regiment Company Commander, Captain Hayashi, was also killed on the spot, and his body was recovered. Three enemy prisoners were captured alive, and an enemy military order was seized, ordering the company to break through the Guangfu line within three days from the 10th to the 12th. After this heavy defeat, the enemy's attempt failed again, and our army's line remains exceptionally solid, unable to be shaken in the slightest.

Central News Agency Special Correspondent with the Army in Guangfu, 9:45 AM, 15th Report: From 3 AM this morning, enemy artillery bombarded our Zhubeizhai and Sunjiazhai positions for two hours. At dawn, about two battalions of enemy soldiers, carrying large amounts of river-crossing equipment, attempted to cross the river but were intercepted by us, causing many enemy casualties.

According to the Central News Agency, along the north bank of Wenzaobang south of Guangfu, the enemy actively advanced westward from Liuhang, attempting to attack our Chenjiaxiang stronghold. Therefore, they stationed heavy troops at Dunwusi Temple, not far away, and confronted us. Fierce fighting occurred the day before (14th), and our army held a significant advantage, advancing eastward.

The enemy's plan to achieve a central breakthrough was continuously attempted, and yesterday, they concentrated the firepower of aircraft and artillery to vigorously attack Chenjiahang, west of Liuhang. Our soldiers braved the rain of bullets and fought unyieldingly. The artillery fire was especially intense from 4 PM to 5 PM. Dozens of enemy aircraft bombed heavily at the same time. In the evening, our artillery unit also exerted great power, retaliating against them. The infantry leaped out of the trenches, charging and fighting fiercely. Machine guns and grenades swept densely, and the enemy soldiers fell to the ground one after another, retreating in disarray, not daring to attack again. To this day, the enemy has only occupied about one kilometer west of the Tangqiao to Luodian highway. Repeated attacks have been unsuccessful. The remnant enemy forces entrenched at Wenzaobang, although attempting to resist stubbornly, have no means to do so. As for Luodian, the enemy's morale is low, and they have never dared to attack our positions. Furthermore, as soon as they hear our army's bugle call, they flee in disarray.

Central News Agency Special Correspondent with the Army in Jiangwan, 9:45 PM, 15th Report: A balloon suddenly rose from the enemy positions in the Gujiazhai area of Liuhang. Our army immediately aimed and fired small cannons. The enemy hurriedly lowered it, and then raised it again. This happened four times. Eventually, due to our continuous artillery fire, the enemy could not leisurely observe as they wished.

### Enemy Northeast of Miaohang Attacked Sanfengzhai, Was Repelled

Central News Agency Special Correspondent with the Army in Jiangwan, 9:45 PM, 15th Report: The enemy east of Miaohang launched attacks from two locations again this afternoon, but were both repelled by our forces. One location was Sanfengzhai, which is on the south bank of Wenzaobang, about two and a half kilometers from Miaohang. The enemy attacked from west to east at noon, but after being met with our counterattack, they quickly retreated. It seemed they were probing our strength. The Jiaqiao bridge south of the house was previously demolished by us, but the enemy has now repaired it, presumably preparing to attack again. The other location was about one and a half kilometers northeast of Miaohang. The enemy occupied Houjia Wooden Bridge, and we defended Xinzhai. The two sides were only 200 meters apart. They had attacked once before but were repelled by us. This afternoon, they harassed again. Our army calmly responded and attacked the enemy's flanks from the left wing, surrounding and severely punishing the enemy, killing many and capturing one. The enemy abandoned corpses and weapons and fled in disarray. At both locations, the enemy suffered heavy casualties, and by the time of this report, they had not dared to attack again.

Central News Agency Special Correspondent with the Army in Jiangwan, 10:25 AM, 15th Report: Guocaizhai, about three kilometers east of Miaohang, is only 300 meters away from our Majiazhai stronghold. The two sides are facing each other. The enemy attacked yesterday afternoon but were repelled by us. Before dawn today, our army carried out a night raid, launching a brave assault from Majiazhai, destroying their警戒线, and penetrating deep into the enemy's positions. The enemy responded hastily, and after only a few engagements, suffered heavy casualties and collapsed. Our army swept away the enemy and recovered Guocaizhai.

### Enemy Warship Aground and Trapped at Baimao Lock

Surrounded and Monitored by Our Army, Can Be Completely Resolved Soon

[Changshu] Eastern Zhang City news received: an enemy warship attempted to sneak across and land last night but sailed into Baimao Lock. This morning, it ran aground due to the low tide. After being surrounded and monitored by our army this afternoon, the enemy warship frantically fired broadsides and machine guns in resistance, but it can be completely resolved soon. Also, a refugee boat attempted to cross the river at Eleven Weigang on the morning of the 14th but was sunk by a passing enemy warship. None of the hundred-plus refugees survived. (15th Special Dispatch)

According to the Central News Agency, an enemy warship was added off Baimao Estuary north of Liuhang. The enemy attempted to land at the estuary three times the day before. However, our river defenses were tight. Even under the enemy warships' intense artillery fire, our army still defended the riverbank. When enemy speedboats approached, we launched a head-on attack, so the enemy ultimately failed.

### Enemy Attack on Shixianggong Temple Repelled

Central News Agency Special Correspondent with the Army in Guangfu, 9:50 AM, 15th Report: From 2 PM to 4 PM yesterday afternoon, enemy artillery fired on our Shixianggong Temple positions for about two hours. It stopped after our artillery retaliated and suppressed them. This morning (15th) at 3 AM, the artillery fire started again, and about 300 enemy infantry, under its cover, attacked our army's right flank at Shixianggong Temple. Our army bravely resisted, and the enemy ultimately did not succeed. After dawn, many enemy corpses were left in our positions, which suggests that the enemy suffered heavy casualties.

The day before yesterday at 3 PM, a balloon rose again from the enemy positions in Luodian and was removed after about an hour. Also, the enemy often hangs cloth bags in trees, hiding inside to shoot at us from a high position. After we discovered this, we killed many of them.

### Shanghai Our Army and Air Force Victory Spread All Over London

Daily Express Said Our Artillery and Bombing Were Very Accurate, Japanese Troops Could Not Support Retreat, Soldiers Defense Area All Suffered Heavy Damage

[London] The largest battle Shanghai has never experienced has begun at dawn today on all front lines. The Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army with an unprecedented offensive. The Chinese Air Force also showed its power and proved effective. The Japanese army's front lines were greatly disrupted by this accurate bombing. According to the latest news obtained by the Daily Express, the Japanese army's defense line near Zhabei has completely collapsed. After repeated attacks by the Chinese army using motorized units, it has occupied a considerable area in Hongkou. The Japanese warships anchored near Pudong last night were bombed by the Chinese army's artillery on the shore. It is still difficult to say what extent the damage reached, but it must be not small, because the Chinese army's artillery fire was very accurate. When the bombs exploded, the universe was greatly shaken, and the sound was so loud that it overwhelmed everything. The panic of the residents was indescribable throughout the city. Chinese people living near the International Settlement panicked and fled into the 界内 as many heavy bombs exploded in areas near the settlement. The same situation occurred in the North Station area. One bomb landed in a crowd, killing twenty-five people, and the injured were not included in this number. When the Chinese army at the North Station was ordered to attack, they immediately carried out hand-to-hand combat. The Japanese army could not support and was forced to retreat. According to another unconfirmed report, the Japanese army suffered extremely heavy losses on that line, both in soldiers and defense areas. The Chinese Air Force also exerted great strength in the battles in Hongkou and Yangshupu. The Chinese Air Force launched a surprise attack in that area, and the Japanese army suffered extremely heavy losses due to this unexpected attack. Later, several squadrons of aircraft were rushed to assist in the battle, and the Chinese aircraft flew away safely. It is said that the main air battle was still in progress until 3 AM this morning. This battle can also be called a pioneering work in the history of Chinese air combat. By 4 AM this morning, fires had broken out in various places outside the city, and the raging flames illuminated the sky. At the same time, the sound of bombs exploding and walls collapsing also came with the god of war. It was clearly audible even miles away. (Central News Agency 15th, Haotong Dispatch)

### Our Air Force Night Raid Achieved Success, Destroying Seven Enemy Aircraft

The water pipes installed at the base of the wall along Huanglu Road were also damaged and broken. However, the enemy has three sets of water pipes, so the water supply will not be cut off temporarily. Workers have already been hired to repair them. This also proves that our army's bombs never miss their target.

At around 7:15 AM yesterday morning, many stray bullets landed in the shacks near the Disweilu-Jiaxing Road bridge in Hongkou, causing the shacks to catch fire uncontrollably. The fire brigade dispatched vehicles to rescue and extinguished the fire after three hours, burning down more than forty shacks.

The Superior Terrain, Excellent Shooting Skills are Especially Amazing, Japan's Air Defense is Almost Zero Compared to Nanjing

[Nanjing] According to Tokyo Daily News, a Japanese air force officer, in a recent interview with a reporter, expressed his feelings about the Japanese air force's repeated attacks on Nanjing as follows: We deeply feel that China's capital, Nanjing, has perfect air defense, superior terrain, and excellent shooting skills, which is especially amazing. Moreover, all building materials are not easily flammable. On the other hand, Tokyo and Osaka in Japan have flat terrain with no high mountains to block them, which is unfavorable for air defense and very worrying.

While the enemy planes were wreaking havoc, our anti-aircraft guns fired intensively, shooting down two enemy planes, one falling into the Jinshui River and the other falling outside the South Bridge Jing Mountain. Both planes were burned. All of the enemy pilots inside the planes were killed. The plane's engine had the following inscription: "Kasumigaura-style starting magnetoelectric generator, Made by Domestic Electric Co., Ltd., May of Showa 12". (Central News Agency Dispatch, 15th)

[Hong Kong] The tracks near Shilong on the Canton-Kowloon Railway were destroyed by enemy planes on the 15th. Two northbound trains were forced to turn back halfway. "It is reported that the repair work is quite extensive" and will require time. As the railway is a joint Sino-British venture, and since enemy warships blockaded the coast of southern China, the railway has become the only transportation route between Guangdong and Hong Kong. Now that it has been destroyed, transportation between the two places has been temporarily cut off. The enemy's disregard for British interests is further demonstrated by the sinking of Hong Kong fishing boats. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 15th)

We suffered no major losses. The enemy planes flew away at 8:45 AM, disrupting Suzhou for a total of one hour. At 11:00 AM on the morning of the 14th, three enemy planes came to Suzhou for a second air raid, circling for twenty minutes. Because our anti-aircraft guns fired intensively, the enemy planes fled in a hurry, dropping two bombs in the suburbs. Our losses are being investigated. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 15th)

### Details of the Martyrdom of Brigade Commander Jiang Yuzhen, Who Firmly Defended Yuanping

Fighting Bitterly and Enduring for Nine Days and Nights; Personally Leading Troops Back and Forth Under Artillery Fire

[Taiyuan] The tragic news of the death of 196th Brigade Commander Jiang Yuzhen, who recently defended Yuanping to the death, has reached here. The authorities are mourning his loss, and the people are deeply impressed by Jiang's sacrifice for the country. All sectors of the city have scheduled a memorial service to be held on the 15th to comfort his loyal spirit. Details of Jiang's martyrdom and his brief biography are recorded as follows: Brigade Commander Jiang was ordered to firmly defend Yuanping on the first of this month to cover the assembly of our large army. He actively deployed defensive works and reported to Commander Yan that if he could not fulfill the mission, he would die with Yuanping. On the 3rd, the main force of the enemy came to attack. Enemy planes and artillery constantly bombed. Jiang commanded calmly, leading by example. Officers and soldiers also gave their lives, fighting bitterly and enduring for nine days and nights. Using a small force to resist a large force, they repeatedly inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. (The brigade also suffered heavy casualties. Regiment Commanders Zhang Zhenling and Gu Shufeng were both seriously injured.) Our large army was able to assemble safely. Commander Yan was very pleased and telegraphed Chairman Chiang, who ordered a commendation. On the 11th, the enemy again transported a large number of reinforcements by car and launched a more intense attack. Jiang personally led the troops under his command, displaying even greater courage, back and forth amidst the gunfire and rain of bullets from the enemy's land and air forces. Unfortunately, while he was energetically commanding, one of his legs was blown off by artillery fire. Soldiers forcibly carried him out of the position. Subsequently, after being discovered by the enemy, they pursued him more fiercely, causing him to be hit by another bullet and killed. At that time, almost all of the officers under his command were killed or wounded, and fewer than two hundred soldiers survived. They had no choice but to withdraw from the position. Brigade Commander Jiang's sacrifice for the country can be described as heroic. Jiang, styled Lianbi, was from Heze County, Shandong Province. In 1917, he graduated from the cadre camp of the 1st Mixed Brigade of the Shanxi Army. He served as a quartermaster, platoon leader, company commander, battalion commander, regiment commander, deputy division commander, and brigade commander in various armies in the province for a total of twenty years. Last year, he was commended for his meritorious service in battle, and the central government awarded him the Fourth Class Yunhui Medal. This time, he fought bravely and resisted the enemy to the death, sacrificing his life at the age of forty-three. He is survived by his elderly mother, aged sixty-five, and three daughters and one son, his son being only seven years old. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 15th)

### Belgium's Capital City to Convene Nine-Power Treaty Conference

Belgian Government Officially Expresses Agreement; Organizational Details to Be Announced Today; Davis to Serve as Chief U.S. Representative

⊙Brussels: Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty signatory countries' conference to be held here, according to well-informed sources, the Belgian government will formally announce it today, at which time there should also be some disclosure of the organizational details of this conference. It is said that the reason for Belgium's late acceptance of holding the conference in its capital is due to actual difficulties that have arisen in the organization of the conference. (Central News Agency/Havas Dispatch, 15th)

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently released a statement to the newspapers, stating that he is closely monitoring the preliminary talks currently underway between the relevant countries regarding the Nine-Power Treaty conference. Once the location and date of the conference are officially decided, the United States will select representatives to attend. Although the convening of the conference is proceeding rather slowly, there have been no delays. (Central News Agency/Havas Dispatch, 14th)

[Washington] The invitation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference should be delivered to the State Department today. Secretary of State Hull intends to formally announce the location, date, and other details of the conference as soon as he receives this document. The selection of the members of the U.S. delegation will also be announced at the same time. Special Envoy Davis has been internally designated as the chief representative. All of the representatives are scheduled to travel to Europe from New York on the "Washington" mail ship on the 20th of this month. However, the State Department has issued an informal warning that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference may not be able to immediately resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute. The United States still holds a long-term policy and does not expect to restore peace through an international shortcut. (National Telegraph, 15th)

[Nanjing] Foreign Minister Wang delivered a broadcast speech to the American people from 7:15 AM to 7:30 AM on the 15th. In conclusion, he appealed to the American people on two matters: first, to avoid any action that would directly or indirectly benefit the aggressor; second, to exert all their strength to support this life-and-death struggle. If these actions can be taken, then you will have fulfilled the moral responsibility you bear for your country's traditional international policy of justice, peace, and righteousness.

Pittman Argues for Tough Stance Against Japan

⊙Reno: Chairman Pittman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee discussed the Nine-Power Treaty Conference with a Reuters reporter today, stating that if the Nine-Power Treaty is not implemented, the world will degenerate and be conquered by power. Since Britain did not cooperate with the United States in 1932, in his personal opinion, this conference should be convened by Britain, and Britain's interests in China are greater than those of any other country. Pittman mentioned President Roosevelt's proposal to invite both China and Japan to attend the conference, stating that if Japan remains stubborn and unrepentant, then the governments that signed the treaty have a moral and legal reason to refuse to associate with it. This determination will not lead to war unless Japan brazenly attacks all countries. However, it is absurd to say that Japan would dare to make the world its enemy. In his view, if all countries have this determination, then no country can wage war. The United States has no treaty obligations to the affairs of any country except for China, because the Nine-Power Treaty is in place. The United States' obligations to China are clearly complete. If the United States is hindered by cowardice and ignorance, then the United States will never be able to make peaceful efforts in the world again. (Central News Agency/Reuters Dispatch, 14th)

Avoiding the Label of Aggression: Japan's Conditions for Participation

[Tokyo] A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry confirmed to reporters today that the Belgian ambassador to Japan had tentatively discussed with Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Horiuchi whether Japan could participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to be convened in Brussels within two weeks. The spokesman said that the Japanese government has not yet responded, but said there is a possibility of participation, but if Japan is labeled as an aggressor, the hope of accepting the invitation is very slim. In any case, Japan is currently awaiting notification of the content of the conference. When asked if the Japanese naval authorities intend to declare a wartime blockade in order to prevent third countries from transporting arms to China, the spokesman said that some naval officers may have this view, but he has not heard of this matter being discussed in high-level official circles.

### Chamberlain Clarifies British Foreign Policy

Seeking Peaceful Means to Eliminate Ill Will Among Nations; Eager for Early End to War in the Far East and Spain

[London] British Prime Minister Chamberlain gave a speech in Manchester today, expressing Britain's desire to quickly resolve the wars in the Far East and Spain. Chamberlain gave a detailed account of Britain's foreign policy and said that Britain's attitude has never been as mild as it is today. Chamberlain also said, "If we are attacked, we have long understood how to defend ourselves, but the nature of the British people has never been to hate others, and they can resolve grievances and make peace with any country after a conflict. The key to our foreign policy is to live in peace with our neighbors and encourage other countries to resolve their disputes peacefully. Therefore, we earnestly hope that the wars in Spain and the Far East, which are causing extreme human suffering, can be stopped at the earliest possible date. Furthermore, we should continue to seek and use all opportunities to eliminate ill will and suspicion among nations." Chamberlain continued to discuss the recruitment of new soldiers, appealing to employers to adopt a sympathetic attitude, even at the expense of their own interests, because all military equipment and facilities cannot be used without manpower.

The Chinese memorandum included proof from the chief physician of the Nanjing Red Cross Hospital and other doctors that the wounded soldiers treated in the hospital indeed showed signs of gas poisoning.

### The League of Nations Will Assist Us in Epidemic Prevention

Subcommittee to Discuss Methods

[Geneva] The Health Subcommittee of the League of Nations, responsible for dealing with epidemic prevention work in China, met today to discuss how to prevent epidemics occurring within China due to the war. It was decided that the following three facts should be recorded: ① A cholera outbreak occurred among Chinese troops and refugees in the Shanghai area. ② If the war spreads to Shaanxi Province, there is a risk of the recurrence of plague in certain areas of the province where plague cases have occurred in the past. ③ The Nanjing Central Hospital, the center of cooperation between the League of Nations Health Organization and the Chinese authorities, has been partially destroyed by Japanese aircraft. Subsequently, Chinese representative Hu Shih-tse declared that the Chinese government requests the shareholders' meeting to pay special attention to the epidemic prevention work in the five provinces of Shaanxi, Hebei, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Guangdong, and to quickly dispatch several epidemic prevention teams to these provinces to carry out epidemic prevention work. Each team should include: ① a health expert, ② mobile epidemic prevention personnel, including a foreign mycologist, and ③ an isolation hospital with a doctor. As for all assistant personnel, they should be provided by the Chinese government. (Central News Agency, 14th, Havas dispatch)

### The Vatican Does Not Interfere in Disputes of a Political Nature

Denial of Various Rumors

⊙Vatican City It has been rumored that the Vatican has formally or informally interfered in the dispute between China and Japan. This claim was firmly denied by Vatican officials, who stated that they were astonished by the various reports circulating from foreign sources. The Vatican has never interfered in disputes of a political nature, especially those of a military nature. Furthermore, the Vatican has a fervent hope for universal peace among all nations in the world and seizes every opportunity to reiterate this. As evidenced by a recent article published in the Vatican's official newspaper, "L'Osservatore Romano," which outlined the Vatican's policies, stating, "Any nation that deliberately engages in war will quickly lead to its own demise." This shows the Vatican's attitude. Moreover, the Catholic Church occupies an extremely important position in China, hence the historically good relations between the Vatican and China. As for the Vatican's attitude towards "Manchukuo," although it amounts to de facto recognition of "Manchukuo," this is only because Japan's control over the entire territory of Manchuria is beyond any doubt, hence this action.

[London] The Mayor of London has scheduled Thursday to officially begin raising funds for the relief of war-torn China. A broadcast speech will be delivered on Wednesday evening to appeal to the nation for donations. Prominent financier Sir Arthur Balfour has already contributed £1,000 with conditions attached, but has indicated that £275 will be allocated to the Shanghai Renji Hospital for emergency medical expenses. In addition, several others have promised to donate substantial sums. Judging from the current situation, there will be many who respond to the donation appeal across the country. Meanwhile, university students in London held a meeting last night, convened by the British Committee of the International Student Service, aiming to raise £4,000 within this year in the UK to supplement the relief funds initiated by the Mayor of London. This entire sum will be used to aid university students and teachers within China. This is part of an international fundraising effort of £10,000. When the university students met, Zhang Pengchun, a professor at Nankai University, was the main speaker. (Central News Agency, 15th, Reuters dispatch)

[London] Morphew, the secretary of the British branch of the International Student Association, and accountant Baker, recently published a letter in The Times, appealing for British assistance to Chinese universities. His letter stated, in brief, that the most distressing aspect of the war between China and Japan is the situation faced by Chinese universities. It appears that Japanese attacks directly target universities. A total of 14 Chinese universities and vocational schools have been destroyed by Japanese aircraft. The authorities of each school are now planning to move inland to resume classes, but this plan is unlikely to succeed without external assistance. The various branches of the International Student Association have already issued appeals, and this association will certainly respond enthusiastically. (Central News Agency, 15th, Havas dispatch)

### The Arrogance and Despotism of Japanese Warlords Will Only Lead to Their Own Destruction

The Poisoning Policy is Beyond Description. Letter Published by a London Business Tycoon

[London] Today, British financial expert and business tycoon, Sir Arthur Balfour, sent a letter to The Times, titled "The Terrible Record of Japanese Drug Trafficking in China." Balfour stated that the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee issued a report on June 1st and 2nd, but the report was not disclosed by newspapers. Balfour argued that this report should be printed as a booklet and made public to make all countries in the world aware of the fate that any country is inevitably bound to face after being controlled by the Japanese military. There is no other way to do this. Balfour further stated that the Egyptian representative of the Opium Committee, Russell Pasha, recounted the true situation he witnessed in the Japanese concession in Tianjin, saying that the horror of the opium dens was so appalling that it could not be described in words. The dens were dark, filthy, and nauseating, creating a frightening atmosphere. In addition to Chinese people, there were also Russians and people of other nationalities lying on unclean wooden planks. There were also children as young as two or three years old who had become dull opium addicts, with swollen heads and thin bodies, almost transparent. Opium injections were given with self-made, unclean needles, which were never washed or disinfected, let alone replaced. As a result, diseases spread uncontrollably among the opium addicts. Balfour further stated that Russell Pasha also said in his report, "In the past two years, there have been many Japanese opium addicts in Harbin, especially Japanese army soldiers and officers." Balfour stated that the French representative also confirmed the above report. Balfour stated that a friend of his who is familiar with the situation in the Far East told him, "The Japanese army uses drug trafficking to create its own financial resources in order to increase its independence and gain control over the government in both financial and political terms." Balfour pointed out that "the real danger in the Far East is that the Japanese government has completely lost its ability to control its military, and these arrogant and despotic warlords, obsessed with power and desire, will not be able to destroy China, or will ultimately lead to the destruction of Japan itself." Balfour concluded by saying that he firmly believes that the Japanese government, representing the opinion of the Japanese people, has begun to feel confused about the actions of its military, "but I cannot believe that the Japanese government truly intends to poison China through its military abroad."

### Active Volunteer Armies Within Pseudo-Manchukuo

Japanese Army Finds It Difficult to Cope. Growing Sense of Unease.

[Harbin] According to sources here, a Japanese troop train derailed near Panshih Station on the Jilin-Shenyang Railway on the evening of the 13th after a small section of the track was removed by the volunteer army. More than 100 Japanese soldiers were killed or injured. (15th, Quick News Agency dispatch) The Shanghai English-language newspaper, China Press, reported that a foreign fur merchant who has lived in Manchuria for many years told a reporter from the China Press on the 15th that Japan has now realized that the well-equipped elite troops it spent millions of dollars to train in Manchukuo are unreliable. It must now dispatch a large number of absolutely reliable Japanese troops to Manchuria for surveillance. "I believe that Japan is spending money to dispatch a large number of troops to Manchuria to suppress unrest, not entirely because of the threat from the Soviet Union. The internal unrest is even more dangerous than the threat from the Soviet Union. Recently, there have been frequent incidents of military units in various parts of Manchukuo revolting and escaping into the mountains with their weapons to join the volunteer army. Residents of Manchuria have learned about the war in China through radio broadcasts or from people traveling there from North China. Although the newspapers all maintain a cautious attitude and only report Japanese victories, the people firmly believe in the news of Chinese army victories. White people there are now increasingly uneasy as winter approaches. Many are sending their families back home, knowing that after the winter arrives and the rivers freeze, the volunteer army will become even more active and aircraft will find it difficult to bomb them. I believe that the large-scale return of Japanese people will cause adverse public opinion and lead to rumors in Japan that there are serious disputes in Manchuria. Manchuria has been under Japanese control for six years, but it has still not been able to maintain stability. Japan's plan to control all of China is even more distant. If the native Manchu troops were to side with Japan, Japan could alleviate the threat from the Soviet Union, but Japan will never gain the support of these people. Even spending millions of dollars each year to lure the volunteer army and use them is ineffective. The situation along the border between Manchuria and Siberia has become even more tense recently. Japan is trying to avoid conflict with the Soviet Union. A few months ago, this conflict could only lead to meaningless threats, but now it could be the fuse for a war. I believe that the Soviet Union will wait until Japan has actually conquered several provinces in North China and gained freedom of action in Inner Mongolia before going to war with Japan. Only Outer Mongolia is preventing Japan from advancing and cutting off transportation between Siberia and the rest of the Soviet Union. If Japan's ambition does not end and it attempts to conquer Outer Mongolia, it will have no choice but to confront Japan with arms. The White Russians in Manchuria are now suspected by the Japanese authorities of secretly helping China, so they are no longer trusted as before and are subjected to various restrictions. Because it is difficult for them to live there, they all want to sell their properties cheaply and move south to China. I expect that the Japanese garrisons in northern Manchuria will be attacked by the volunteer army this winter, and their losses will be greater than in any winter since 1932. Although it is not difficult for the Japanese army to suppress them, it requires a large army to be stationed in Manchuria, which will cost a huge amount of national funds. Japan's war against China has already affected Manchuria. Japanese people no longer want to move to Manchuria, and they no longer want to invest in Manchuria to develop its natural resources. Before the war against China, Japan had almost completed the work of pacifying Manchuria. Now, the previous efforts will be abandoned, and it will have to be managed again."

### Minister Wang Cables Thanks to British Professors

[Nanjing] 117 professors from 18 British universities recently sent a joint telegram to Minister of Education Wang Shih-chieh, expressing their outrage at the Japanese army's bombing of civilians and schools in China, and expressing their deep sympathy for the Chinese people. They also stated that over one hundred professors will use their influence to urge the British government to take effective measures to stop Japanese aggression. Many of those listed in the telegram are authorities in the United States. Professors Gilbert Murray of Oxford University, and Tawney and Laski of the University of London, are among those listed. It is learned that Minister Wang has cabled back to the British professors. The telegram stated, in brief, "Deeply moved by your telegram. Your telegram has been circulated in China. I hereby express my thanks to you, and on behalf of the government, express my gratitude. As I send this telegram, 20 Chinese universities and vocational schools have been deliberately destroyed by the Japanese army, and these destroyed schools are hundreds or thousands of miles away from the war zone. You can imagine my heartache. However, the determination and confidence of the Chinese people and educational institutions to overcome the current disaster are growing stronger day by day. The sympathy of all sectors of the United States, especially your sympathy, has greatly encouraged us. I firmly believe that your continued efforts will hasten the collapse of Japanese aggression. This will be fortunate for human civilization." (15th, Central News Agency dispatch)

### Complete Compromise Between Britain and France on the Spanish Issue

The Non-Intervention Committee to Meet Today. The Two Countries Will Issue a Joint Declaration.

[Paris] French political observers recently declared that despite attempts by the diplomacy of external forces to sow discord between Britain and France regarding the withdrawal of foreign volunteers from Spain, a complete compromise has indeed been reached between London and Paris. It is reported that the main points agreed upon by both sides include: ① The final attempt to ensure that all countries respect the policy of non-intervention must be made as quickly as possible and should be of a decisive nature. ② If this final attempt is declared a failure, it is absolutely necessary to adopt a new policy to rectify the current situation. In addition, observers firmly maintain that regardless of how the issue of volunteer withdrawal progresses, Britain and France must maintain close contact to ensure the safety of the Mediterranean. (Central News Agency, 14th, Havas dispatch)

[London] The issue of withdrawing volunteers from Spain will be discussed by the subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Committee at 10:30 am on Saturday. The countries participating in the meeting include Britain, France, Italy, Germany, the Soviet Union, Portugal, Sweden, and Czechoslovakia. Representatives from Britain and France will deliver a declaration, strongly arguing that the issue needs to be resolved as soon as possible. It is reported that the wording of the declarations from both Britain and France is largely the same, avoiding a threatening tone towards Italy, but insisting on practical methods for the withdrawal of volunteers. (Central News Agency, 15th, Reuters dispatch)

[London] According to reliable sources, Britain and France have begun considering a joint naval patrol of Menorca by the navies of Britain, France, and Italy. This may prevent Italian influence from spreading from Majorca to Menorca. Italian bombers are now using Majorca as a base. France originally wanted to occupy Menorca as a countermeasure, while Britain advocated expanding the scope of the Nyon Agreement's naval surveillance to prevent the situation in the Balearic Islands from being mixed up with the issue of volunteers.

### Chamber of Commerce Federation Cables International Organizations, Exposing the Brutalities of the Japanese Army

Urging Allied Friends Not to Be Deceived by Sophistry, but to Collectively Seek Sanctions to Maintain World Peace

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China in this city has cabled the League of Nations, requesting that the aggressor country be severely sanctioned. Recently, it has again cabled US President Roosevelt, requesting that he take active practical sanction actions in addition to verbal statements. It is learned that the Federation is deeply concerned about the recent dispatch by the Japanese of a large number of sophists to Europe and the United States, hoping to use sophistry to cover up their conspiracy to destroy peace and monopolize East Asia, as the brutal days of Japanese aggression in China have poisoned the innocent and destroyed the commerce of various countries in China without any sense of remorse. Therefore, the Federation is now paying close attention to the international situation, and will soon cable international organizations such as the International Labour Office and the American Chamber of Commerce Federation, exposing the brutalities of the Japanese army in China and their aggressive desires, in order to prompt people of allied countries to understand the truth, not to be deceived by sophistry, and to further implement sanctions to maintain world peace.

### Japanese Aircraft Wantonly Bomb Foreigners' Properties

American Soldiers Also Wounded

The Shanghai newspaper, North-China Daily News, reported that Japanese aircraft dropped bombs near the concession on the Suzhou Creek on the afternoon of the 14th, killing ten Chinese people on the spot and injuring more than twenty others. Among them, five were American sailors. Several other Japanese aircraft bombed near the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway in the western district, causing numerous Chinese casualties and damaging seven or eight foreigners' houses along Hongqiao Road. In addition, the Shanghai newspaper, The Times, reported that according to reliable sources late on the night of the 14th, the residence of a foreigner named Miller, located at 140 Hongqiao Road, was destroyed by Japanese aircraft. The house completely collapsed, and the value of the property has not yet been estimated. It was verified that the German flag was hanging on the roof of the house when the Japanese aircraft bombed.

### Sa Chen-bing Sends Gao Lu and Others to Comfort Wounded Soldiers

Sa Chen-bing and Gao Lu, representatives of the Anti-Japanese Support Association of Fujian Province, have arrived in Shanghai in order to express their respects to the army. Yesterday, Mr. Sa specially dispatched Gao Lu, Liu Tong, Xu Xianshi, and Shi Jialin to the Wounded Soldiers Comfort Group of the Municipal Comfort Committee at No. 418, Central Building, Edward Road. The group dispatched inspector Zhu Ya-kui to accompany them to various hospitals to comfort the wounded soldiers. Each hospital was left with a certain amount of comfort money based on the number of wounded soldiers. In addition, students and staff from Tsinghua Elementary School, Cunde Elementary School, Tianshan Quan Le Yuan Qunfang Club, the Shanghai Office of the Construction Committee's Electrical Plant, and other organizations went to the Second, Fifth, Ninth, Twelfth, Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Eighteenth, Nineteenth wounded soldier hospitals and the Baolong Hospital and Haig Road Red Cross Hospital yesterday to comfort the wounded soldiers.

### Economic Sanctions as a Potent Weapon to Stop Aggression

Universal Implementation Will Not Lead to a World War; Failure of Sanctions Against Italy Should Not Deter Future Attempts; Letter from a Foreigner Published in the North-China Daily News Explains Reasons

The North-China Daily News yesterday published a letter from someone using the pseudonym "Americano," which reads: "To the Esteemed Editor, I deeply admire your newspaper's fair attitude towards the Sino-Japanese disputes and conflicts of the past five years. While I agree with the path of mediation, which should be initiated, I cannot concur with your views on the implementation of economic sanctions. The recent telegram sent by the China League of Nations Association to the League of Nations Associations of various countries contains valuable points, advocating that the following steps should be taken when the Pacific Powers Conference, convened according to the Nine-Power Treaty, is held: ⑴ cease hostilities; ⑵ withdraw troops invading China; ⑶ both sides issue statements of mutual non-aggression; ⑷ conduct mediation to resolve the long-standing disputes between the two sides; ⑸ if Japan refuses to cooperate or obstructs the above four steps, then the conference should proceed with implementing economic sanctions against Japan until it withdraws its attacking forces. The first three steps should, of course, have a definite time limit; otherwise, Japan will, as Mussolini did in the Abyssinian and Spanish issues, simply prolong negotiations. However, after the activities of the China League of Nations over the past fifteen years, the first four steps must be recognized as the best way to resolve military conflicts. To discuss mediation while Japanese troops occupy one-third of Chinese territory is like seeking a fair judgment from someone holding a gun. This procedure also clearly shows that aggression is not a recognized way to try to resolve mutual disputes. This is a crucial point. The Chinese Council advocates a complete solution and total troop withdrawal instead of any partial solution. Those foreigners who aim to protect interests outside Shanghai, I believe you must agree with the first four steps. The point of disagreement between us lies in the fifth step, but I believe that if the first four steps are tried first, your opposition to implementing economic measures will likely soften. I think that you have not distinguished the different natures of ⑴ a single country or a group of countries implementing a boycott or economic sanctions to retaliate against an oppressor, and ⑵ economic sanctions decided by a group such as the League of Nations or a conference organized according to the French Treaty. The first kind aims at retaliation to the extreme, while the second kind is decided by a group representing world opinion, calmly and rationally, following legal procedures, after hearing the statements of both sides, to stop the outrageous aggression of a neighboring country. There is no other way than economic sanctions; otherwise, one can only resort to force. This kind of group may not have the complete wisdom of God, but it is the most humane and the fairest organization available to us for resolving international disputes (except for the World Court, but its jurisdiction is limited). You and many sincere seekers of peace and justice fear that the decision to implement economic sanctions will lead to war. The best guarantee to eliminate this fear is to have the majority of countries in the world cooperate in the sanctions, making their implementation universal. Because of this universality, this kind of action is different from a coalition of several countries restricting the imperialist expansion of another country. We are not trying to stop Japan's development, but to stop Japan's use of war and aggressive means. If we allow it to act with impunity today, then Japan will act with impunity in other cases, and will plunge us into a state of worldwide anarchy. The universality of economic sanctions and their origin in international resolution will not lead to war. If implemented internationally, it cannot even be considered a 'diplomatically unfriendly act.' If universally implemented, one or three countries would never rashly declare war on the whole world. You cite the fact that economic sanctions ultimately failed to stop Italy's invasion of Abyssinia as an excuse to oppose them, but it is worth noting that the sanctions against Italy did not lead to war. If a single country had done this to Italy, Italy might have felt compelled to declare war on that country. Mussolini was able to use the threat of war to intimidate Britain and France, preventing them from advocating for expanded sanctions in the League of Nations, but would Mussolini have carried out his threat if the League of Nations had done so? This is purely speculation, but the important point is that the implementation of sanctions against Italy was not enthusiastic and was very slow, and the United States did not participate. Furthermore, this was the world's first attempt, and one should not oppose future attempts simply because of the first failure. Car manufacturers do not stop developing cars after the first failed experiment. You fear that the victims of economic sanctions are the people of the sanctioned country, that these sanctions will cause disorder in that country's industries and suffering. This is undeniable, but the tragedies caused by Japan's invasion of China affect not only China but also Japanese families, where fathers and sons often receive orders in the evening and enlist the next morning. Before we speak out against economic sanctions, we must weigh which suffering is greater. We should also consider the suffering that other countries will endure in the future if we allow the wars of the new era to spread endlessly. To reduce the suffering caused by sanctions, food and medicine should be excluded. This is not a serious issue in Japan, as it is self-sufficient in food. However, this can set a good precedent for implementing sanctions. As for the relief needed by unemployed people in Japan, it can be provided by other countries. This measure may not even be necessary. Implementing economic sanctions should be done with the same caution as implementing any power and oppression, with careful guarantees of fair judgment and efforts to make humanitarian limitations. The world has not yet reached the point where we can proceed with careful restrictions without using power. Economic sanctions are a tool worth thoroughly experimenting with by all countries concerned about abolishing war. May all countries in the world, strong and weak, enjoy security and do their utmost to seek development and progress. Respectfully, So-and-So."

### Japanese Commentator Takano Fushimi Comments on Sino-Japanese War

States that If Japan Becomes Entangled in a Protracted War, European and American Countries Will Be Delighted

Japanese well-known commentator, Takano Fushimi, wrote an article in the Yomiuri Shimbun on October 5th, entitled "The War Starts Now," saying that Japan benefits from a quick victory; if it becomes entangled in a protracted war, European and American countries will be delighted at the depletion of Japan's national strength, especially Britain and the Soviet Union. The bloody war between two major Eastern ethnic groups, mutually slaughtering each other, the fiercer the battle, the more it pleases Europe. Therefore, the war between two major Eastern ethnic groups is actually falling into Europe's trap. European and American countries will fully supply arms and ammunition to prolong the war, and they will reap the benefits. This point should be deeply noted by Japanese politicians and the people.

### Gold and Silver Items Used as National Salvation Donations

Realized at Fixed Prices, Amounting to Over 60,000 Yuan

The Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association's fundraising for national salvation donations ended on September 10th. During the period from August 7th to September 10th, the association collected a total of 14,558 gold and silver items. Except for 383 items such as silver trophies, all items were transferred to the Central Bank in two batches, realized at fixed prices, and used as national salvation donations. These included 1,035 gold items, weighing 136 taels, 9 mace, 6 fen, and 7 li; 2,855 silver standard coins; 1,164 silver subsidiary coins; 199 silver dollars, weighing 1,863 taels, 7 mace, 4 fen, and 5 li; 6,922 utensils, ornaments, and gifts, weighing 38,441 taels, 1 mace, and 9 fen. According to the Central Bank's fixed price, gold was worth 115 yuan per tael, less 1 yuan and 3 mace per tael of mercury, and then deducting water according to the color, and then adding 6% of the premium. Therefore, the total amount of gold and silver items collected by the Anti-Enemy Association and used as national salvation donations was 62,450.78 yuan in national currency.

### City Party Headquarters and Others Send Telegrams Welcoming Vice President Kong's Return to China

Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, was ordered to go to England in April of this year to attend the coronation ceremony of the British King and visit European and American countries. He originally planned to stay in Europe for a short time, but due to the start of China's full-scale war of resistance, he hurried back to China and arrived in Hong Kong from Manila the day before yesterday. The city party headquarters, the Anti-Enemy Support Association, the Local Association, and other public organizations in this city, upon hearing the news, sent telegrams to Hong Kong to welcome him. The original telegrams are recorded as follows: ⑴ The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters telegraphed, "To Comrade Kong Yongzhi, Vice President, Hong Kong: Your Excellency, you were appointed to this important position, made meritorious contributions in foreign lands, and worked hard for the country. We are delighted to hear of your return and extend our respects. We send this telegram to welcome you and wish you good health. Sincerely." ⑵ The Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association telegraphed, "To Mr. Kong Yongzhi, Vice President, Hong Kong: You were appointed to this important position, visited neighboring countries, cultivated friendly relations, expanded resources, increased national credibility, transferred funds to the front lines, like the virtuous prime minister Xiao He, and made meritorious contributions in foreign lands, comparable to Ma Fubo. We send this special telegram to welcome you and ask for your guidance. Sincerely." ⑶ The Shanghai Local Association telegraphed, "To Special Envoy Kong Yongzhi: You traveled thousands of miles for the country, not only planning finances but also awaiting your contributions, and also diligently planning military supplies. In the past, the Marquis of Zan transferred funds and provisions from Guanzhong, which stabilized the Han Dynasty, and he was credited with the first merit. Today, we rely on overseas as our foreign treasury. The difficulties are significant, and we rely on your support. Now that we hear of your return, we are deeply moved by your hard work. We send this telegram to welcome you. We respectfully ask for your attention. Du Yong, Qian Yongming, and Wang Xiaolai."

### Loyal and Brave Battalion Commander Liu Dies for His Country, Though Dead He Still Lives

Company Commander Jiang Also Made a Heroic Sacrifice

A reporter from the Central News Agency accompanying the army in Zhabei reported at 12:00 noon on the 15th that when our army attacked North Sichuan Road last night, Liu Hongsheng, Battalion Commander of the □□□ Regiment of the □□□ Division, took the lead, charging through the blood and fire, and was hit by several bullets. He still fought the enemy while wounded. After breaking through the enemy's line, he shouted to kill the enemy and died, making a heroic sacrifice. Those who heard it were moved. All the troops, seeing this, were inspired.

Yangjia Village, near Luodian, is the defensive area of the Fourth Company of the Second Battalion of the □□□ Regiment of our □□ Division. The enemy repeatedly attacked, and suffered heavy casualties. Among them, Major Ikeda Haranobu, the squadron leader, was also killed by us. On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, the enemy's attack was even more urgent, and bullets fell like rain. Our army suffered many casualties. The enemy took the opportunity to charge. Our Company Commander, Captain Wang Yun, seeing the critical situation, bravely disregarded his own safety and threw a hand grenade. Unfortunately, the grenade did not leave his hand, and he was shot by the enemy's gun. He exploded and died in front of the position. His spirit of sacrificing for the country was deeply admired by the enemy.

### Comfort Society Receives Large Quantities of Comfort Goods

Guan Yuting Enthusiastically Raises Funds; Chaozhou Fellow Villagers Continue to Transport Supplies

Guan Yuting, manager of the Yangtze Hotel, is enthusiastic about national affairs. He previously raised 10 cars, 2,000 cotton vests, and a large number of sacks, which he sent to the Comfort Society for forwarding to the front lines. Now, he has raised a large quantity of rubber shoes, including 600 pairs donated by Yongcheng Signal in Hong Kong, Guan Yuting, and Li Shounan; 600 pairs donated by Guangshengchang, Guan Yuting, and Feng Bolian; 300 pairs donated by Liang Qingci of Shanghai Fusheng; 300 pairs donated by Xinchangtai in Hankou; 150 pairs donated by Liu Chunlin; 25 pairs donated by Li Yunan; 50 pairs donated by Deng Xiangming; and 75 pairs donated by Yichangsheng, totaling 2,100 pairs, as well as 500 cotton vests donated by Guan himself. All of these were sent to the Comfort Society yesterday for collection and forwarding. The society expressed its deep admiration for Guan's enthusiastic fundraising.

The Chaozhou Association in Shanghai is working hard to comfort the soldiers at the front. Recently, they sent comfort goods to a certain anti-enemy unit, including 600 wool sweaters, 500 pairs of rubber-soled shoes, 20 military blankets, and 60 cotton quilts raised from the pawnshops. They also sent 600 cotton vests to the Comfort Committee in this city for forwarding to the soldiers at the front, including 100 pieces each raised by committee member Li Shurong from Xingrong Xinghua and Huaxin Company. It is said that they are still working day and night to produce more.

Current Affairs Commentary

### A Turning Point in the Western Front

— Yi

From a topographical perspective, Shanxi Province is mountainous everywhere, which is disadvantageous to the enemy. The activities of mechanized units in that area are limited. The war can be sustained for a long time. Moreover, we must rely on the Shanxi Plateau as a base to recover the lost territories in the north. Therefore, whether the war in that area is sustained or not has a decisive significance for the overall situation in North China.

In the early stages of the war, the enemy quickly occupied Tianzhen and Datong, and then invaded Yanmen Pass. This could not but cause deep concern among the people of the country. But now a bright new situation is gradually unfolding. According to recent news, our army in northern Shanxi is counterattacking and winning successive victories. Laiyuan and Ningwu have been recovered one after another, and the enemy's rear has also been cut off by our army.

The reason why the war situation has improved is, of course, due to the bravery of our frontline soldiers. But there is another more fundamental reason that we cannot ignore. This is the development of the spirit of military-civilian cooperation. We know that the military and political authorities in Shanxi Province felt the importance of mobilizing the people's power long ago. Before the War of Resistance, there were anti-enemy organizations such as the Sacrifice for National Salvation Alliance, but due to the bureaucratization of the leadership, they did not show the expected effect in the midst of the war. Since the fall of Datong, the lessons of the failure of Li Fuying's unit have made the military leaders on our western front deeply realize that to win victory, we must call on the entire population to participate in the War of Resistance in a new, practical, and effective way. As far as we know, the military leaders on the western front are intensifying their efforts along this path. Now the military and civilians in Shanxi are gradually integrating into one. We can see significant results from the widespread development of guerrilla warfare.

Shanxi Province alone has more than 10 million people. When such a large force of people closely cooperates with the military force of hundreds of thousands of troops, will the enemy's attempt to invade Shanxi not be crushed by us?

### Britain Refuses to Participate in World Games, Our Sports Community Responds

Demanding the Cancellation of Imperialist Japan's Membership Qualification and Vowing to Avenge the Disgrace of the Illegal Dissolution of the Far Eastern Games

The British League of Nations Union and Sports Association, in order to oppose the violent Japanese invasion of China and the destruction of peace, has repeatedly proposed that when the 1940 World Games are held in Japan, British athletes should refuse to participate, demonstrating that punishing evil and eliminating violence is a universal sentiment. We have learned that the sports community in this city greatly agrees with this proposal. At the same time, the Sports Community National Salvation Association, which is being organized by Central Committee member Chu Minyi and others, also sent a letter to the National Sports Federation yesterday, suggesting that they immediately send a telegram to the British League of Nations Union and the British Sports Association, expressing their adoption of the same action, thereby giving the violent Japanese spiritual sanctions. The original letter is extracted as follows:

Respected Sirs, since the strong enemy invaded our country and launched a full-scale war of resistance, sports undertakings have been virtually suspended. We, the members of the sports community, believe that the sports community is also a member of the people, and we should work for the country and save the crisis together. However, due to the lack of leadership, we are not in a position to initiate it ourselves. We have found that the Central News Agency's London Havas telegram recently stated that the British League of Nations Union and the British Sports Association have proposed that when the 1940 Olympic Games are held in Japan, British athletes should refuse to participate, demonstrating that punishing evil and eliminating violence is a universal sentiment. The purpose of the Olympic Games is to maintain world peace. Today, imperialists are risking injustice and acting arbitrarily. The so-called world peace has been completely destroyed. Not long ago, the Japanese Sports Association still declared to all countries that the preparations for the World Games would not be suspended due to the Sino-Japanese War. From this point of view, Japan's contradiction has reached its extreme. At this time, if all countries prepare to participate in the World Games again, it is tantamount to supporting the aggressor and violating the purpose of the Olympics. Not only that, we still remember that in 1934, when the Far Eastern Games were held in the Philippines, the Japanese did not hesitate to violate public anger and destroy the organization of the conference in order to allow the puppet Manchukuo to participate in the competition. Looking back at the past, our sports community still has lingering pain. The above shows the Japanese people's sinister intentions and poisonous schemes. We, the members of the sports community, cannot remain silent. For this reason, we plan to launch the national sports community to rise up again, and respectfully ask all countries to unanimously refuse to participate in the 1940 World Games, and convene the Olympic Executive Committee to discuss how to cancel the membership of the Japanese imperialists, and plan to move the World Games of that year to another country, to win an honor for our country's sports community in the international arena. We are in urgent need and await your orders. Sincerely, the China National Sports Association and the Sports Community National Salvation Association, October 14.

### Enemy Planes Indiscriminately Bomb and Massacre Our Civilians Yesterday

Yesterday They Even Strafed Patients at Puji Hospital

Starting at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, enemy planes were out and about again. The southeast of the Pudong Electric Company, the area of Lujiazui to the east of the Anli Warehouse, the Chuansha Light Railway to the east of Yangjing, Yangjing Town, and Dachang were all bombed by enemy planes. From 12:30 p.m. to 1:00 p.m., enemy planes dropped bombs on a section of the railway line between the North Station and Mindelu Road. Bombs also fell near the Pudong Cemetery. From 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., enemy planes dropped bombs on the west side of the Jiangwan Racecourse, near Baziqiao on Hutai Road, and in Pudong. Enemy planes also bombed about a quarter of a mile west of the North Station. The details of the bombing by enemy planes in various places are recorded as follows:

Pudong

At 7:00 a.m. yesterday, several enemy planes flew to the West Pier of Yangjiadu in Pudong and dropped more than 20 bombs. The enemy planes circled the area for up to four hours. After 6:00 a.m. yesterday morning, enemy planes were dispatched to indiscriminately bomb the sky over Pudong. From morning to dusk, there were as many as fifteen or sixteen planes, and as few as two or three planes, circling all day long in Yangjing, Qichang, Yangjiazai, Zhangjialou, Tangqiao, and other areas, dropping hundreds of bombs. The area of Yangjing Town suffered the most damage, with seven bombs falling on the street and more than ten bombs falling around it, destroying dozens of civilian houses. Some rural areas in other places were also damaged. More than ten civilians were injured by the bombing. According to someone who came to Shanghai from Shangaqiao yesterday, enemy planes suddenly dropped bombs, with two bombs falling on Dujiawan, killing residents and injuring more than ten people. Also, the family of a certain villager in Zhangjiazai was burning the deceased's clothes and belongings on the open ground in front of the door for a funeral, and was also bombed by enemy planes, destroying two coffins on the spot, with bones flying everywhere, a tragic sight. Furthermore, a certain elementary school on the edge of Gaoqiao Town was bombed, destroying more than ten houses, but fortunately, no one was injured. It has been found that there is no military equipment in that area, which is quite obvious. This act by the enemy planes is a deliberate massacre of our innocent civilians.

Zhabei

Yesterday morning, from about 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., three enemy planes in formation circled several times in the air over Zhabei, and then dropped bombs in turns, with each plane dropping one bomb each time, for a total of fifteen bombs in five times before leaving. The second time was from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m., with three enemy planes still circling as before, also dropping fifteen bombs. The third time was from 3:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., with three enemy planes also circling for more than ten weeks over Datong Road and Zhongxing Road, dropping a total of eighteen bombs. The bombs in the morning all fell on Baoshan Road and the area south of the printing plant of the Commercial Press on Qiujiang Road. Most of the bombs in the afternoon fell on the wasteland along the railway and both sides of Zhongxing Road west of Zaoqiao.

Tongqiao

The Puji Sanatorium in Tongqiao on Humin Road in Shanghai County is jointly run by Mr. Lu Bohong, a Chinese philanthropist, and people from the United States and France. It is a completely charitable institution specializing in the treatment of mental illnesses. Therefore, there are about one hundred and several dozen mentally ill people seeking treatment in the hospital. Special attention is paid to their daily diet and care. Therefore, patients are routinely released every day in the morning and afternoon to roam freely on the open space in the hospital to regulate their bodies and minds. The roof of the hospital has always displayed the French flag, and there is a Red Cross sign at the entrance. At 4:30 p.m. yesterday, when the patients in the hospital were taking a walk, an enemy plane flew in from the north and circled over the hospital to scout. Suddenly, it descended three times and continuously opened fire with machine guns to strafe downward. Fortunately, the hospital authorities were alert and immediately ordered everyone to lie down, so no one was injured. However, some patients who were already ill due to fright suffered severe terror and their conditions worsened. The hospital has now reported to the president of the hospital and asked to negotiate with the enemy.

Qingpu

Yesterday, a villager who came to Shanghai from Zhujiajiao Town in Qingpu County said that at noon on the 14th, three enemy bombers flew to that area to circle and scout, and then dropped seventy-six bombs in the nearby rural area of Yuye River. One bomb fell on the wasteland next to the refugee shelter in that area, exploding and injuring twenty or thirty refugees with shrapnel. Three of them had ruptured abdomens and protruding intestines and were in critical condition.

### Minyi Ambulance Completed

The Minyi ambulance, which was initiated and prepared by Chu Minyi and Gu Bonjun, has received donations of more than 3,000 yuan from all walks of life after raising funds through the Chinese and Western Broadcasting Stations. They immediately started to work on it, costing a total of more than 4,000 yuan. The car has now been assembled and has been sent to the Chinese Red Cross for acceptance. A meeting will be held on a regular basis to invite all donors to visit and distribute credit records.

### Coming and Going in the Bombing

— Guo Moruo

Seven

At about 9 o'clock, after I had changed into my pajamas and was writing a diary in the room, Mr. Lizi came.

Mr. Lizi's attitude was more refined and scholarly than before, and it made people feel close to him at first sight. I haven't seen him for more than ten years, and I felt that he was a little older and fatter than before, but he said that I was younger than before. Some friends have said this, and I don't know why. I think it's probably because of this war of resistance. The result of this war of resistance has revitalized our national spirit and swept away the accumulated shame, sorrow, anxiety, and resentment that had shrouded our nation. The wrinkles on my forehead and the waves of depression between my eyebrows should also have disappeared with the revival of the nation.

Yes, our entire nation should be younger than before.

—I remember that we first met in Guangdong in April 1926, when the Blood Flower Troupe of Guangzhou performed my "Pear Blossom" at the Youth Association, and we watched the play together. After the play was over, I went back to Guangdong University in his car. Do you remember that?

I looked back on this past event, and Mr. Lizi also remembered it very clearly.

Mr. Lizi asked me about the situation when I returned to China, and also talked about the publicity work, and talked for about an hour before getting up to leave. When I sent him downstairs, he saw that I was wearing pajamas and was afraid that I would catch a cold, and he told me several times to be careful. I felt like I had met one of my elder brothers.

The first night's sleep in the capital was very comfortable.

### Airmail Service as Usual at Post Office

Handled with the Utmost Speed Daily

Since the relocation of the China and Eurasia Aviation Corporations to the interior, Shanghai, due to its status as a war zone, has been unable to maintain regular flights. According to the New News Agency reporter, the two companies' abandonment of the Shanghai air station was truly out of necessity. The Eurasia Company's Hankou, Changsha, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Xi'an, Chengdu, Gao Lan, Ningxia, and Guihua routes, and China's Jiujiang, Hankou, Shashi, Yichang, Wanxian, Chongqing, and Chengdu routes, are all operating as usual, carrying mail and passengers. Therefore, the Shanghai Post Office continues to accept airmail destined for various locations along the routes of the two companies, handling it daily with the utmost speed, transporting it by train and car to designated locations, and transferring it to the two companies' aircraft for delivery.

### Procedures for Writing Letters for Wounded Soldiers

Since the outbreak of the war, people from all walks of life have enthusiastically visited the Red Cross and the various relief hospitals affiliated with the Municipal Relief Association to慰問 the wounded soldiers. Some even bring paper and pens to the hospitals to write letters for the soldiers. However, this method is not perfect, its effectiveness is low, and it has many drawbacks. Therefore, in addition to the慰問 work, which has been decided by the Municipal慰問 Association to have a unified method, the Red Cross and the Municipal Relief Association, together with the Postal Workers' Union, have jointly agreed that the Postal Workers' Union will assign one to six staff members to each hospital to specifically write letters for the wounded soldiers, remit money, send clothing, and handle other postal-related work from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily.

### Enemy Makes Major Infiltration Attempt from Miaoji, Fierce Battle Continues Until This Morning, All Repelled

Countless Spoils of War Captured, Enemy Suffers Heavy Casualties. Enemy Attempts to Break Through at Black Huang House and Other Locations Thwarted. Fierce Fighting in Zhabei This Morning, Our Forces Defeat the Enemy on All Fronts.

After suffering heavy blows from our forces on the south bank of the Wenzaobang, the enemy is now trapped along the riverbank, deeply entrenched in their trenches, afraid to venture out. Our heavy troops surround them from three sides, and the remaining stubborn enemies will soon be completely wiped out. Last night, the enemy made several attempts to break through, but all were repelled by our forces. The enemy has lost all hope on this front and has been transferring troops in a very busy manner in recent days, seemingly to concentrate their activities in another location. We are fully prepared for the enemy's usual tactics of avoiding the real and attacking the unreal, of feinting east and attacking west, and they will definitely not succeed. Starting at 7:00 PM last night, over a thousand enemy soldiers infiltrated south from Miaoji on the north bank of the Wenzaobang (Miaoji is northeast of Miaohang, about three kilometers from Miaohang), fiercely attacking our Sanfengzhai position, aiming to take advantage of a weakness to spy on our Miaohang. Our fresh troops rushed to counterattack, and fierce fighting continued until 3:00 AM this morning. The enemy was defeated and retreated. Our forces took advantage of the victory to pursue, leaving hundreds of enemy corpses behind. The remaining enemy fled across the river. In this battle, we captured many spoils of war and took over ten prisoners. This was the initiation of the enemy's plan to avoid the real and attack the unreal, but it was completely crushed by our forces. In addition, the line from south of Luodian Shixianggong Temple to Guangfuzhen was relatively calm. Large units of enemy troops were moving around very busily. There was intermittent artillery fire between the two sides. On the Zhabei front, the enemy has been constantly attacking since last night until this morning. Fierce fighting occurred on Qiujiang Road, Guangdong Street, and Shixing Road. Our forces on all fronts defeated the enemy, and our front lines remained firmly in place. Several enemy heavy bombers flew to Zhabei, western Shanghai, Xujiahui, and Hongqiao this morning, causing havoc. The rumbling sound was deafening, but there was absolutely no damage to our military.

According to the Central News Agency, a war correspondent with the forces in Guangfu reported at 9:00 AM on the 16th that Jinjialong Daweiqiao near Luodian is an enemy artillery position. Yesterday, it fired on our Caowangmiao area positions. After we accurately measured its position, we retaliated with heavy artillery, destroying several of their guns, after which they ceased firing and have not been able to cause further trouble. In addition, the enemy facing Pujiamiao has been constantly firing on our positions with rifles and machine guns from last night until this morning, seemingly to test our strength. We know that the enemy does not dare to attack rashly, so we did not retaliate. In addition, the enemy near Zhubeizhai has been quiet since their failed attempt to cross the river yesterday at dawn, and the enemy has not dared to attack again.

### Enemy's Infiltration Attempt at Miaoji Last Night Suppressed

Few Survivors from Enemy's Two Companies. Many Enemy Rifles, Machine Guns, etc. Captured.

While the fighting was intense on the south bank of the Wenzaobang and in the Guangfuzhen area, the enemy attempted to feint east and attack west again yesterday, infiltrating from Miaoji, about three kilometers northeast of Miaohang, on the north bank of the Wenzaobang, hoping to attack our Miaohang position. Yesterday evening, enemy artillery across the river relentlessly bombarded our positions on the opposite bank to cover their troops crossing the river. At that time, because the enemy's artillery fire was too dense, our troops could not get close to the shore. About one thousand enemy soldiers, about the size of two companies, managed to cross the river. Our troops calmly responded, not making a sound, waiting until they had crossed the river and had not yet established themselves, and then began to suppress them. Our troops, in a mass formation, launched a fierce attack. The enemy was caught completely by surprise. During our troops' bayonet charge, the enemy artillery across the river was completely ineffective. The enemy was panicked and fled in disarray, with countless falling into the water to escape. The remaining stubborn resisters were all wiped out by our machine guns. Few survived. The bloody battle continued until 3:00 AM this morning. The infiltrating enemy troops have all been eliminated. Enemy corpses littered the ground, a gruesome sight. Upon inspection of the enemy corpses, several company commanders were found to have been killed by our troops. Our troops captured over one hundred rifles, over ten light and heavy machine guns, and over ten enemy soldiers were captured alive. The enemy troops across the river have now disappeared and dare not attack again.

### Enemy Attempts to Attack Miaohang

Enemy Seems to Be Moving Eastward, A Fierce Battle Will Soon Occur

According to the East China News Agency, after the enemy's plan to infiltrate the south bank of the Wenzaobang and attempt to attack our Dachang was foiled by our forces, although there have been fierce battles on the Jiangwan and Zhabei lines in the past two days, the focus is still on the north and south banks of the Wenzaobang. The enemy has not given up their ambition to attack Dachang and is currently waiting for reinforcements to plan another attack. Our troops are closely monitoring them. The enemy east of Miaohang has been very busy with troop movements since last night. Tanks and armored vehicles are crisscrossing various intersections, seemingly preparing for a major eastward attack. It is expected that a fierce battle will occur in the Miaohang area sooner or later. However, our side has deployed heavy troops nearby to defend and is waiting in full battle array. If the enemy attacks, they will definitely not succeed.

### Enemy's Counterattack in Zhabei Fails

Gunfire Rumbles Ceaselessly Through the Night, All Attacks Repelled by Our Heavy Blows

On the Zhabei front, after our forces launched a fierce attack on the enemy the day before, the enemy from North Sichuan Road to Laobazi Road and Henghang Road has been placed under heavy pressure. Therefore, our forces now occupy an absolute advantage, not only causing the remaining enemy who infiltrated the Wenzaobang to worry about their rear, but also causing the entire enemy line to feel that it is difficult to coordinate. However, in order to deliberately show strength and avoid exposing weaknesses, the enemy launched continuous attacks on our Tiantong'an, Baziqiao, Baoshan Road, and even Jiangwan positions last night and this morning. The sound of machine guns, hand grenades, and small mortars did not stop throughout the night. However, all attacking enemies were met with heavy blows from our forces, suffering heavy casualties. Our front lines did not move at all. In the battle at 63 Huayuan, we killed over 70 enemies and seized eight light machine guns.

Confirmed sources say that since last night, the fighting has been quite fierce in the Baoshan Road, Bazi Road, and northern Huishan areas of Zhabei. The sounds of gunfire and hand grenades intertwined. The enemy army used field guns to launch a fierce attack on the North Station and also used heavy artillery to attack the northern Huishan area. Our army on Maigen Road in the northern part of the Huishan area also fired artillery towards the northern part of Qiujiang. At about 6:00 AM this morning, the enemy army launched a fierce attack on Baoshan Road again, and planes also flew to that area to bomb. At about 8:00 AM, enemy planes also dropped bombs at the intersection of Zhongshan Road near Gonghexin Road, and there was also artillery fire. Machine gun fire near Baoshan Road continued incessantly. There was also artillery fire at Henghang Road, Tiantong'an Road, and other locations. Chinese and Japanese ships in the Huangpu River simultaneously fired artillery at the northwest of Dachang. Also, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM, there was fighting in the North Station and Qiujiang Road areas.

According to a Central News Agency war correspondent in Zhabei at 12:00 PM on the 16th, after our army counterattacked and wiped out the enemy army on the streets west of North Sichuan Road, our army has completely controlled the traffic on that road. The enemy is under great threat and is trying to restore its lost power. The enemy attacked the street corners at 11:00 PM last night, and our outposts immediately greeted them. The sound of gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls for a time. At around 2:00 AM this morning, our army rushed out to North Sichuan Road again and engaged in street fighting with the enemy for four hours. The enemy suffered heavy losses and retreated.

According to a Central News Agency war correspondent in Jiangwan at 12:00 PM on the 16th, the enemy in the city center, at 4:30 AM this morning, advanced from Xiangyin Road to spy on our Yejia Garden and Tiyuhui Road positions, using their tanks and fierce artillery fire to pursue us. Our army calmly held on, waited for them to approach, and then rushed out together, dividing into groups to intercept the enemy. After a fierce battle until 7:00 AM, the enemy army sent out planes to cover their retreat. Our army then retreated to their original defense. Enemy corpses littered the road, reaching over 50, and there was also a tank overturned on the side of the road, showing the extent of the damage suffered by the enemy.

### Enemy Aircraft Continue to Run Rampant as Before

Zhabei

Starting at dawn this morning, enemy aircraft continued to operate in all directions, not stopping until noon. The areas they reconnoitered and bombed are described below: From 10:15 AM to 10:50 AM, three enemy aircraft, all heavy bombers, first circled over Zhabei, then dropped heavy bombs, three in the first wave, six simultaneously in the second wave, and three in the last wave, for a total of twelve bombs. All fell on Yongxing Road and the east and west sides of the railway near Gonghexin Road, only damaging a few civilian houses.

Western Shanghai

At 7:30 AM this morning, three enemy heavy bombers flew from Pudong to southern Shanghai, west of Xujiahui, Hongqiao, and both banks of the Suzhou Creek, and bombed again. Several empty cars were slightly damaged at Xujiahui Station. It has been found that since the Hongqiao commercial market was shut down, small vendors and sellers of fish and meat are still selling in the open air there, so enemy aircraft often go there to bomb. At around 10:00 AM, three enemy aircraft flew to western Shanghai and Longhua to bomb non-military areas, injuring over twenty civilians.

Southern Shanghai

Three enemy aircraft circled over Xieqiao Tangjiaqiao in the southern city twice this morning, at 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM, and scouted the area from the Huangpu River to the Nan Railway Station, Rihui Port, and Gaochang Temple, and frequently strafed with machine guns. They did not drop bombs in the Nan Station area and flew west.

Pudong

At around 7:00 AM this morning, three enemy aircraft flew to Pudong to scout and bomb. The situation did not seem as intense as yesterday, but after 8:30 AM, more enemy aircraft appeared and dropped over thirty bombs indiscriminately in the Yangjiadu area. Except for three injured pedestrians, our military facilities suffered no damage. Also, the enemy's attempt to cross the river into Pudong failed and was bombarded by our artillery, so to vent their anger, they opened fire in the Qichangzhan area, using flat-trajectory guns to bombard civilian houses, causing the houses of the villagers in the Tiedianqiao Zhuangjiazhai area to be destroyed. Also, several enemy aircraft bombed Pudong all day yesterday. An investigation this morning found that the damage south of the South Huangpu警戒 line was still minor, but in the Qichangzhan, Shiba Jian, and Yangjing Zhangjialou areas, the civilian houses within the pier were bombed into scorched earth. There were not many civilian casualties. A child was bombed to death in Shenjianong. Also, Yangjia Town, which is more than twenty miles from Yangjing, is a remote and poor area with never a soldier or policeman. Since the war, Pudong villagers fleeing to the interior have taken refuge there. Unexpectedly, enemy aircraft dropped three bombs there yesterday, destroying many houses and killing or injuring at least thirty refugees. The enemy's habitual massacre of unarmed civilians is evident.

Early this morning, at about 5:30 AM, a large number of enemy aircraft suddenly appeared in a corner of the eastern district, the buzzing sound shocking the whole city. According to a reporter from Hualai News Agency after investigation, these enemy aircraft flew from outside Songkou, mostly bombers, especially old-fashioned biplanes, but also some single-wing army or small reconnaissance aircraft. The number was no less than sixty. In teams of three, they circled and flew around for a week, then flew in different directions to the southwest, seemingly to harass the various Jinghu, Huhangyong lines.

### Enemy Alluring and Fooling People in Baoshan

Looting Cotton and Rice Worth Ten Million Yuan, Vagrants Hired Suffer Unspeakable Misery

Shishan County had a bumper harvest of cotton and rice this autumn, a phenomenon unseen in previous years. Just as the normal farmers were about to harvest, the war suddenly broke out, causing them to flee and disperse, making it impossible to harvest. Recently, according to sources, about 200,000 dan of cotton and about 500,000 dan of rice have all been seized by the enemy, worth about ten million yuan. A certain gentleman from Baoshan, when talking about this matter, could not contain his indignation. The residents of Baoshan County who are currently under the iron heel of the enemy are only old, weak, and disabled people who are natives, their number not even reaching fifty. They are currently under the jurisdiction of a puppet local maintenance association. The enemy colluded with this puppet organization to come up with a method, that is, to recruit ignorant and foolish people to work, dividing them into several teams, listening to their command, working all day long, not allowed to be idle, and if they do not meet their expectations, they are immediately whipped, just like cattle and horses. They are also required to pick one dan of cotton or harvest two mu of rice per day. They work hard, only able to accept their fate. The enemy's so-called preferential treatment is to give them two meals of rice per day, and at night they are locked up in the Shuiguan Temple and other temples, not allowed to move freely. If they escape without permission, they are immediately shot. Their misery is even worse than that of prisoners. To the suffering compatriots on the sea, please do not fall into their trap in the future, lest you throw yourself into the net and not be able to escape.

### Enemy's 5,000 Reinforcements Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

An East China News Agency reporter learned reliably this morning from a reliable source that yesterday afternoon, the enemy's second-class cruiser "Kawanauchi" arrived in Shanghai from Sasebo, carrying 5,000 enemy reinforcements. After landing at the Yangshupu pier, the ship moved to another pier to unload military equipment.

According to foreign sources, due to the enemy soldiers not being accustomed to the water and soil, one-tenth of the enemy soldiers who were transferred to Shanghai were found to be suffering from epidemics. Recently, due to lack of sleep and poor diet, the number of those suffering from dysentery is increasing daily. In total, over four thousand enemy soldiers in Shanghai are suffering from this epidemic.

### Remnants of Enemy Troops on the South Bank of the Wenzaobang Break Out, Repulsed

Attacks from Black Huang House and Zhu House Both Repelled by Our Heavy Blows, Collapsed and Retreating

On the south bank of the Wenzaobang, there are still a small number of remaining enemies that have not been eliminated. Yesterday, they rekindled their efforts and launched fierce attacks on our forces surrounding and monitoring them, attempting to break through. At the same time, in response to the infiltration at Miaoji, the fighting was most intense at Black Huang House and Zhu House. Our forces fought bravely, holding their ground and not retreating. Two small villages near Black Huang House were once occupied by them, but they were of no importance. The enemy attacking Zhu House was met with heavy blows by our forces in Shenjiawan. After suffering heavy casualties, they collapsed and retreated. The fierce fighting continued until dawn this morning. The enemy was forced to retreat to their original positions in the river and huddled in their trenches, not daring to come out again, only relying on their artillery across the river to provide some cover. Our forces also suffered some losses last night during the fierce attacks on the enemy at both locations.

### Over 500 Enemies Killed by Our Forces Near the Plains on the Jinpu Line

Attacked the Enemy's Flanks, the Enemy Found it Extremely Difficult to Cope

[Jinan] Military sources say that on the 15th at 10:00 AM, the enemy on the Jinpu front launched a fierce attack on our Cui Weierzhai Yuanjiazhuang Shuangmiaozi area near the plains. Our forces fought bravely against the enemy, engaging in bayonet charges four times, killing over 500 enemies and seizing enemy officers' swords, diaries, pistols, and other items. (Central News Agency, 15th)

[Jinan] Road sources say that the Jinpu front was quiet at night. On the morning of the 15th, there was continued artillery fire. Our forces on the front line still firmly held the positions near Zhangzhuang Station. Our left-wing troops advanced into the enemy's rear, and our guerrillas were especially active behind the enemy, making it extremely difficult for the enemy to cope. (Central News Agency, 15th)

In addition, the five countries that signed and joined later, namely Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Mexico, and Bolivia, are also among those invited. (Havas, Central News Agency, 15th)

⊙Hyde Park President Roosevelt told the press that the primary task of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is to find a solution to mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute, and that his broadcast speech on the 12th of this month was intended to emphasize compromise. (Havas, Central News Agency, 15th)

### British Foreign Secretary Speaks on the Far Eastern Situation

Endorses Roosevelt's Declaration

[London] Last night, the British Conservative Party held a party member meeting in Llandudno, North Wales. Foreign Secretary Eden gave a speech addressing the Far Eastern situation. Eden expressed his hope that all countries concerned with the Far East and requiring its cooperation would participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. As for the British side, it has decided to participate sincerely in accordance with the spirit of President Roosevelt's declaration. Eden said that Prime Minister Chamberlain had previously given a warm welcome to President Roosevelt's declaration in his speech in Scarborough. Eden believes that Roosevelt's Chicago speech is equivalent to awakening all countries to reflect on their pledges of good faith and the sacred call of treaties. Eden added, "It is fortunate that the president of the world's strongest republic has raised his arms and cried out, awakening us who had promised not long ago to avoid using force as an instrument of national policy at a time when international riots are rampant and the rule of law is non-existent." (Reuters, Central News Agency, 16th)

[London] The British Empire Youth Federation recently held a conference in Osett City, Yorkshire. Conservative lower house member Sir Wilson gave a speech saying that the United States should adopt a non-interference policy towards the Far East and the Spanish issue. This is not a temporary expedient, but a principle that British foreign policy should follow. "Speaking of the Far East, although the Soviet Union is a neighbor of both China and Japan, it has never taken interference actions, which is completely opposite to the situation in Spain in the past two years. In short, when the time for resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute comes, the interests that the British side possesses should have sufficient power to protect." (Havas, Central News Agency, 15th)

### League of Nations to Help Us Prevent Epidemics

Subcommittee to Develop Plans

[Geneva] The League of Nations Health Subcommittee today approved detailed measures to assist China in preventing epidemics. These measures were formulated in accordance with the outline presented by the Chinese representative, Hu Shize. Hu advocated that the committee should pay special attention to sanitary matters in 蘇, 冀, 贛, and 魯 provinces, and that epidemic prevention personnel should be dispatched to these provinces immediately. Each team should have a foreign epidemic prevention commissioner, a microbiologist, a sanitary engineer, and an isolation hospital, including one foreign physician, one ambulance, and ten light transport vehicles. Other drivers and junior staff can be supplied locally. However, each team must have a foreign machinist. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 15th)

### Xu Shiying Sends Staff to Report

Huang Bodu Visited Foreign Minister Wang the Other Day, Scheduled to Come to Shanghai Today, Still Needs to Go to Japan

Huang Bodu, secretary of the embassy in Japan, received a mission from ambassador Xu Shiying to return home on official business. Mr. Huang took a boat from Kobe to Hong Kong at the beginning of the month, and arrived in 京 on the 14th via the Yuehan Railway. He was summoned by Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui to report on his mission. A reporter from the New News Agency recently learned from Lao Shenfu at Xu's residence that Mr. Huang has telegraphed to Shanghai to report that he is scheduled to leave 京 for Shanghai today to handle official business for Ambassador Xu. After the public business is completed, he will still need to go to Japan.

### Disturbing Enemy Ships by Stealthily Setting Water Markers

Lightening Our Side's Destruction

Enemy ships from Nantong Communication and Yanglinkou have repeatedly come to spy. On the Langshan River surface, they intermittently shell the northern and southern banks of Liuhaisha. Because they are fifteen or sixteen li away from the shore, the shells all land on the riverbank, only destroying some peasant houses. The waterway of the Tongzhou River surface has always been a natural barrier. Since our side removed the lightships and buoys on the river, the enemy ships have used speedboats and sand ships as guides when sailing, returning to and from Tonghu as usual. They also dispatched survey ships to measure the depth of the river water and erect buoys. When erecting the buoys, they sent planes to provide cover. For several days, during the small tidal flow of the Yangtze River, most of the enemy ships had returned to Yanglinkou. Our stationed troops have now destroyed all the buoys stealthily set up by the enemy and seized a ship abandoned by the enemy outside the Twelve Forts harbor of Changyinsha. Enemy ships arrived in the area on the 4th and furiously shelled Changyinsha in retaliation.

### China Oil Lamp Company Establishes Branch Factories in Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian

Provincial Construction Departments Vie to Invite Cooperation

Shenshi News Agency reports that since the outbreak of war, the enemy has illegally blockaded our country's coast, cutting off the source of kerosene. In the provinces along the Yangtze River, the price of kerosene has risen to more than ten yuan per can, and there is still a shortage. The same is true for the coastal provinces. Residents have no light for their lamps. The China Oil Lamp Company, previously to stop loopholes and recover profits, invented the Zhongling-style vegetable oil lamp to replace the kerosene lamp, which was deeply praised by all sectors as a national defense machine. At this extraordinary moment, in order to expand its business and contribute to national defense, the company sent staff members to Hankou and other places to establish branch factories. In recent days, it has successively received multiple telegrams from the Nanjing Construction Committee and the Construction Departments of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces, all inviting the company to send technicians quickly to cooperate with the government's investment and manufacture oil lamps locally. It is reported that after receiving the telegrams, in addition to General Manager Tian Liao Fuyu going to Nanchang for negotiations, both Zhejiang and Fujian dispatched personnel for negotiations as soon as possible to achieve success quickly in order to meet the urgent need.

### Tongde Medical College Resumes Classes

Because the school building of Tongde Medical College in this city has fallen into the war zone, it has been decided to start school in the affiliated hospital on Tongfu Road, and classes officially resumed on the 11th of this month. It is reported that all new and old students in this city have arrived and are attending classes on time. Students from other places are also continuing to register. In addition, many students from other schools have come to borrow classes at this college.

### Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Donate Enthusiastically to Save the Country

Overseas Chinese Pre-Purchase National Salvation Bonds for Five Million Yuan

A dispatch from the Philippines reports that since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the violent Japanese mobilized troops and actively invaded our country. Subsequently, battles broke out in Hebei and Shanghai. All sectors of the overseas Chinese community in Manila immediately organized the Aid to Resist the Enemy Support Association to promote voluntary donations to support the war effort. For a time, all provinces and prefectures rose up enthusiastically. According to statistics from the Shantou Consulate, as of August, a total of more than 1.2 million yuan was raised. Although this amount is not large, there are several matters that are sufficient to demonstrate the patriotic fervor of the overseas Chinese: 1. A 14-year-old student at Puzhi School used all of his 24 yuan savings to buy 5,000 pieces of bread and handed them over to the Overseas Chinese Women's慰勞 Association to send to the front line to reward the soldiers. The association, considering that bread was not easy to transport, immediately auctioned it off in a public place, calling it "patriotic bread." Some people bought one piece of bread and donated 50 Philippine pesos, raising more than 1,800 yuan. This amount was used by the Women's 慰勞 Association to purchase goods and send them to the front line in Shanghai. 2. The Boy Scouts of the Overseas Chinese Middle School held a drive to collect burlap sacks from various Chinese stores, donating more than 70,000 sacks and more than 1,800 yuan in cash in one week. 3. The Women's 慰勞 Association received more than 100 pieces of gold necklaces and gold rings voluntarily donated, which were scheduled to be auctioned off. 4. In addition to voluntary donations, the Aid to Resist the Enemy Support Association also organized groups to solicit donations from door to door. Those who were stingy and refused were announced in the newspaper to be ostracized by society. 5. There are four Chinese newspapers in Manila. Since the outbreak of the war in the motherland, each newspaper has published extra editions three times a day, selling each sheet for two copper coins. The overseas Chinese are more eager for extra editions than for letters from home.

Recently, the government issued National Salvation Bonds and established branch offices in various provinces and prefectures. Within a week, more than one million yuan was voluntarily subscribed. In the future, overseas Chinese throughout the Philippines should be able to subscribe for more than five million yuan.

### Brief Commentary

— Xiang

The Nine-Power Treaty is about to be convened. Or rather, the international situation is not serious. If a settlement is reached, there may be unreasonable results. This aspect is indeed worth considering. However, 1. The situation in North China was not good in the past few days. Recently, there has been a turning point. According to the news last night, the battles in North China are being won steadily. Pingxing Pass has been recaptured by our army. Self-reliance is an immutable principle. Therefore, fighting more as we lose more, losing more as we fight more has long been the strategy. Assuming there is no hope for victory, relying on others is futile. 2. If other countries are afraid of the rampant epidemic and speak righteously to uphold humanity, this unreasonable result should not occur. 3. If various countries only seek momentary peace and ignore the spread of the epidemic, and this undesirable result occurs, they will reap the consequences later. 4. This time, our country's resistance is not only for the survival of a nation but also for the survival of the world's democratic principles. Unilateral reconciliation will only hasten their own demise.

### Regulations for Collecting Stamp Tax During Extraordinary Times

Double the Tax Rate According to Regulations and Appropriately Expand the Scope. The Chambers of Commerce Request Exemption from Fines for Tax Evasion.

The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China in this city yesterday received Telegram No. 8021 from the Ministry of Finance, which stated: "Telegram from the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce: Stamp tax is considered a good tax for its light burden and broad use. During the European War, all countries increased it appropriately and listed it as one of the important tax revenues. The tax rates stipulated in the current Stamp Tax Law of our country are not only lighter than the peacetime tax rates of various countries but also not heavier than the Stamp Tax Law and the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax of the early Republic of China. The government adheres to its principles and will not lightly talk about increasing taxes to cause hardship to merchants and people unless absolutely necessary. However, times are changing, and flexibility is needed. In this extraordinary period, military needs are numerous, and various consolidated taxes and tobacco and alcohol taxes have been increased successively. In order to enrich national revenue, it is necessary to formulate temporary measures to double the current stamp tax rates and appropriately expand the scope of taxation to supplement the national treasury. The amount of fines for punishing tax evasion will also be increased separately to facilitate implementation. It is clear that the people's burden will increase slightly as a result, but during the full-scale war of resistance, tax revenue is the lifeline of military needs. One point of tax revenue can strengthen the country by one point. Moreover, the new temporary law formulated this time adds very little to the burden of taxpayers, while the government accumulates every bit to benefit the country, which is by no means insignificant. The Ministry has drafted nine articles of the Provisional Measures for the Collection of Stamp Tax during Extraordinary Times, which have been submitted to Chairman Jiang of the Military Commission for approval. They are scheduled to be announced and implemented on October 11th of this year. Once the situation is resolved, comprehensive adjustments will be made to return to normal. The national crisis is so severe that there are countless people who destroy their homes to relieve the national crisis and enthusiastically contribute. Merchants and people have always been aware of the great cause and love the country and will not lag behind others. They should be able to understand the difficulties of the times and strive to pay taxes, without shirking or evading, so as not to be suspected of obstructing important government affairs. In addition to ordering the provincial stamp, tobacco, and alcohol tax bureaus and the tax bureaus of each district to promptly announce to the merchants and people to comply with the regulations, and issuing separate orders, the Ministry of Finance hereby telegraphs the association to forward this temporary measure to the chambers of commerce in each county, to inform the merchants and people, to comply with the regulations together." Ministry of Finance seal.

Provisional Measures

Provisional Measures for the Collection of Stamp Tax during Extraordinary Times. 1. The tax rates stipulated in items 1 to 35 of the tax rate table in Article 16 of the current Stamp Tax Law shall be doubled uniformly. For example, if the current tax rate is one cent, it shall be changed to two cents; if it is one dime, it shall be changed to two dimes; if it is two cents per hundred yuan, it shall be changed to four cents, and so on. 2. In addition to doubling the tax rates in items 1, 2, and 3 of the tax rate table in Article 16 of the current Stamp Tax Law for each piece of goods or amount of three yuan or more and ten yuan or more or one hundred yuan or more, one cent of stamp tax shall also be levied for each piece of goods or amount of one yuan or more but less than three yuan. 3. The sentence "The maximum amount of stamp tax affixed to each piece of certificate stipulated in Article 16 of the current Stamp Tax Law shall not exceed ten yuan" shall be temporarily deleted. 4. Memorials, applications, petitions, guarantees, commitments, and undertakings shall each be affixed with one dime of stamp tax. 5. Deeds for mortgaging or selling real estate shall be affixed with four cents of stamp tax for every hundred yuan of the mortgage or sale price. Any amount exceeding one hundred yuan shall also be calculated as one hundred yuan. The stamp tax shall be valid whether it is affixed to the red deed or the white deed and shall not be affixed again. 6. The fine stipulated in Article 18 of the current Stamp Tax Law, which is ten times or more but thirty times or less of the tax payable, shall be changed to twenty times or more but sixty times or less. When the multiple is calculated to be less than five yuan, a fine of five yuan shall be imposed in addition. 7. The sentence "The amount of the combined penalty stipulated in Article 20 of the current Stamp Tax Law shall not exceed three times the fine to be imposed on the most serious incident" shall be changed to six times. 8. Except for those articles of the current Stamp Tax Law that have been amended by these measures, the remaining articles shall still be handled as before. 9. These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

Scope of Exemption from Penalty

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "Telegram from the Nanjing Ministry of Finance Jun Jin Zhen Ri Shui No. 6 regarding the promulgation of temporary measures for the collection of stamp tax during extraordinary times was received on the 刪日. The newspapers also began to report it in the news column today and it was not separately announced by your ministry. The government gazettes publishing the laws and regulations have not been purchased by various merchants. Although this association has a copy of the government gazette, the gazette has not yet been delivered. The order from your ministry Jun Dai Dian stating that October 11th is the date of promulgation and implementation arrived after the date of promulgation. The stampable items that have been issued by various merchants have long been distributed to customers in this city and other places and cannot be recovered for additional stamping. If they are punished in the future for not stamping or stamping an insufficient amount, it would be unfair according to the principles of things. In addition to the association rushing to publish advertisements in the newspapers of this city and issuing another notice, it is proposed to ask your ministry to inform the stamp tax inspectors that such incidents should be exempted from punishment during the period before the order arrives. It is a public convenience. As for account books and other items, since they have already been stamped once a year, the increased tax rate should be calculated from the end of the business year. Combined declaration. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bows respectfully."

### Financial and Industrial Situation in Shanghai During the Full-Scale War of Resistance

Funds Flow Inward to Assist Rural Development. People's Livelihood Enterprises Plan to Move Factories Inland.

At the moment when the full-scale war of resistance breaks out, the degree of change in Shanghai's financial and industrial circles, which hold the economic hub of the country, is of particular concern to society. A reporter from Xinxin News Agency specially explored and recorded the details as follows:

Financial Stability, Effective Measures

Since the financial situation in Shanghai has been affected by the war for the past two months, the number of exchanges in the clearing house has gradually shrunk, reducing by eight-tenths compared to before the war, which is obviously caused by the stagnation of industry and commerce and the weakening of payments. From the perspective of finance in a war environment, credit circulation is far inferior to peacetime. This is a phenomenon that various industries should have in preparation for transitioning to extraordinary times. However, the actual stability and good situation are beyond our expectations. The reduction in the bank's foreign exchange and the rate of living is due to the sharp reduction in the import of foreign goods and the weakening of foreign exchange needs, so the foreign exchange market is naturally deserted. However, the internal and external businesses of the Bank of Communications and commercial banks are becoming increasingly developed, which proves that funds are continuously flowing into the inland rural areas. According to experts, the stability of finance in extraordinary times is due to the government's effective measures and the cooperation of the financial community. In the future, as Shanghai's important industries gradually move inland, Shanghai's funds will flow inland in large quantities. Recently, the main Zhuangjia in the money industry are also planning to move inland to assist inland industrial and agricultural enterprises. It is expected that inland funds will be promoted as much as possible in the future, which can not only develop production efficiency but also maintain existing enterprises. With the assistance of the silver money industry, the production and construction of the inland can gradually develop, which is of great benefit to the sustained war of resistance.

Low-Grade Cigarette Factories' Business Develops

According to the survey conducted by the Social Affairs Bureau before the war, there were 5,525 factories, 16,851 workshops, and 86,639 shops in this city. However, since the outbreak of the war, some have fallen into the war zone, and some have ceased business, reaching nine-tenths. Its rise and fall are truly shocking. According to the survey, among the main industries, except for the factories in the Yangshupu war zone, only one-tenth of the textile factories can maintain operations. All silk reeling factories have been shut down. Flour mills are related to the people's livelihood and are mostly located in safe areas, so eight-tenths of them are operating as usual. Silk weaving factories produce near-luxury goods, and the sales channels have been drastically reduced, so only one or two are operating, and they have reduced their work. Cigarette factories in Yangshupu, such as Huacheng and Nanyang, have not been able to operate. Small factories in safe areas, such as other parts of Nanyang and Fuxin and Jinsha, are shipping goods as usual. Moreover, the output of large factories has been reduced, and the small factories that specialize in low-grade cigarettes have developed better than before. Other factories, such as those for soap, monosodium glutamate, knitting, machinery, cosmetics, printing, and handicrafts, are all determined by social needs. The factories related to the people's livelihood are all planning or preparing to move inland within a possible range in order to maintain their own businesses permanently and to comply with the general mobilization principles during the war of resistance.

### Du Yuesheng and Others Relief to Refugees in the Suzhou Area

Recognized Fundraising of 100,000 Yuan

Former Minister of Education Zhang Zhongren and four Western missionaries from Suzhou, including Mei Naikui, came to Shanghai at risk the other day, because the rear work in Suzhou was tense and there were many refugees, who were in urgent need of relief. They specifically asked Chinese and Western people and fellow villagers in this city to find ways to donate large sums of money to provide relief. A banquet was held at the International Hotel the night before, inviting Yan Fuqing, Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, Bei Songsun, Ye Fuxiao, Lu Ganchen, You Huaifu, Ji Weishi, Liu Zhanen, and Western friends in this city Anderluo, Bailaide, Beike, Ge Jiaen and other hundreds of people, first by Zhang Zhongren chairman painfully stated that since the Shanghai war, the tragic situation of refugees fleeing from the mountain war zones such as Dachang and Luodian, more than 100,000 people have passed through the territory, and at least tens of thousands of people have stayed in Suzhou, all of whom have no home to return to, which is very sympathetic. In addition to the association's shelter, there are also wounded soldiers passing through the territory, who urgently need practical relief. Due to the outbreak of the war, the wealthy class has avoided to other places, and most of those who remain are civilians who have no power to help, so they can only ask Western friends to come to Shanghai to appeal for donations. Subsequently, Yan Huiging, Beike, Anderluo, Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou and other gentlemen delivered speeches, and Du Yuesheng and others initiated on the spot and were responsible for raising 100,000 yuan, which will be remitted to Suzhou within days for relief, in order to complete the good deeds of relief and rescue in the rear. Those who are willing to donate enthusiastically from the Suzhou area and fellow villagers in Shanghai can send the money to Mr. Du Yuesheng, or directly remit to Mr. Zhang Zhongren in Suzhou.

### Enemy Ships Peep at Sijiaoshan

Traitor Gang Guides and Massacres Fishermen. Food Panic Will Lead to Automatic Abandonment.

A dispatch from Fengxian reports that the news of enemy ships moored at Sijiaoshan has been rumored for a long time. Recently, many fishermen escaped from the mountain and came to Fengxian, claiming that two weeks ago, enemy ships did approach the coast, and Jiangbei traitors guided them to land to survey the land and plan to build wharves and other projects. However, the mountain is full of reefs, and the water is turbulent, and the wharf was destroyed by the impact, so it has not been completed. Nearby sea areas are patrolled by traitor-rowed boats. Fishing boats that were unable to avoid the nets at sea were mostly massacred. The households living in the mountains were also ravaged, and young women were raped at will. The cruelty is unspeakable. Most of them have now fled to avoid temporary refuge. However, the mountain has always relied on sweet potatoes as its only food, and it has recently been scraped clean. Even fresh water has long been exhausted, so the enemies are very panicked and unable to maintain it. When the fishermen left the mountain, there was talk of automatic abandonment. It is also known that enemy planes have recently been flying over the coastal area along Zhapu Jinshanwei from time to time. A week ago, bombs were dropped near the Jinshan Street seawall. It is located in a remote area and did not harm people or animals. The ocean surface has recently been haunted by enemy ships, but they are extremely far away, and only a few plumes of black smoke can be seen. As for the public security in various places, it is still very quiet and normal because the local authorities have strengthened the defense.

### Municipal Education Hall Goes North to Comfort Troops

The Shanghai Municipal Education Association's work for supporting the resistance against the enemy is carried out by participating in various departments of the Municipal All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association. In order to concentrate efforts, no separate organizations are formed for each item. It has also been decided to participate in the northern comfort activities and has already joined the comfort team initiated by the Support Association, which will go north together with various public organizations at the same time.

### Pan Zhiquan Solely Operates a Wounded Soldier Hospital

Mr. Pan Zhiquan, the Chinese general manager of the British Nanyang Jardine Matheson & Co., saw that this violent Japanese was rampant and that our loyal soldiers were defending the country against the enemy, so he uniquely operated a wounded soldier hospital to rescue our wounded soldiers. The internal equipment is perfect, and news reporters are welcome to visit. Yesterday, he also purchased a high-quality telescope and donated it to the ××th Division. Mr. Pan has always been kind-hearted and has been more enthusiastic since the war of resistance. His sentiment is admirable.

### Autopsy of Nine Victims of Stray Bullets

The victims who were injured by stray bullets the other day and died as a result have been inspected by the Special Court. The deaths reported by the police this morning included Zhan Xiaoguan (a one-year-old boy) and Zhan Yinfeng (an eight-year-old girl) who were bombed to death outside No. 343 Suzhou Road, an unnamed man who was bombed to death on Baker Road, Yuqiaqing Road, and five men and one woman who died in the Xinzao police station area. A total of nine people have also been identified by the Special Court and ordered to be buried.

### How Can Young People Find National Salvation Work?

— Liu Ri'an

Everyone, I know that many of you have already participated in the work of saving the country, but the number of those who have not yet found work is also quite large. I specially brought up this question to discuss, but before we get to the main topic, let's all take a look at the current situation of work supply and demand. Now, the front line says that our support capacity is thin because there are many things that we cannot satisfy the soldiers on the front line. The young people and the masses in the rear feel the distress of not being able to find salvation work. Is this really a weakness of our support capacity? I can say absolutely not, this kind of phenomenon is entirely due to the uneven distribution of work. It's like asking someone who doesn't know how to shoot to charge on the front line, and asking a gentle and weak person to do the work of carrying things, all of which are futile. Not only will there be no effect on the work, but it will also easily destroy inaction and easily make unnecessary sacrifices. In retrospect, we hear many people say that they can't find salvation work, saying that there is no return to the thread, and a contradictory situation of being neither young nor old has been created.

Now, I only hope that those who already have work will work hard on their assigned tasks, so that people are satisfied with our work.

If you don't have a job, you should see if your family is well organized? Is the strength of the family concentrated? Then see if the neighborhood you live in is well organized? Has it been mobilized? What strength is there? What kind of work can you do? If you can't answer this question immediately! Then you can't say that there is no work to do, everyone must understand that work can be done anytime and anywhere, for example, the people in the rear are not very clear about the enemy's ambitions to invade us, they also don't know much about the significance of this war of resistance, and we need to give them a very detailed explanation. When the enemy uses poisonous gas to attack us, do the people in the rear know how to defend themselves? Are gas masks prepared? Why don't we pay attention to these kinds of work?

Or, when bombs are dropped from enemy planes, many people are killed, but those who are not killed are either slightly injured or seriously injured. Which of these poor injured people doesn't need us to give him first aid? Do we usually have this kind of knowledge preparation? Do we have this kind of skill preparation? Isn't this very important work? Everyone, we should not think that work can only be done by setting up a stage or hanging up a sign, and we should not be preoccupied with the name of the work, and we should not think that work with a name is work, and vice versa, work with a name is not necessarily meaningful inaction, and work without a name is definitely not unimportant work. In fact, the work of saving the country is everywhere and can be done anytime and anywhere, as long as we are willing to do it, as long as we are really working for the work, what can't we do? If you do this, I guarantee that your work will make you so busy that you don't even have time to eat.

Finally, I hope you don't rush to sacrifice yourselves, now is not the time for us to sacrifice, don't think that only those on the front line are working, and those in the rear are not inaction, we must know that a strong front line must have a stable rear.

Therefore, young people who think they have not yet found work may as well take the work mentioned above as their own inaction, first mobilize all the people in our family and neighborhood, gather our talents, and unite our strength. I dare say that during this long-term war of resistance, the government will definitely need us these already gathered talents, these already united forces. To take on the most important work in this scorched earth war of resistance, please wait!
