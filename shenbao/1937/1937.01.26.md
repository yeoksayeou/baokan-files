### Madrid Under Fire

— Translated by Bin Fu

With the support of international fascist imperialism, Spanish rebel forces have been besieging Madrid for nearly two months. During these two months, the people of Madrid have been living under intense artillery fire every day. The wounded are wounded, and the dead are dead. The young are fighting to the death to defend the capital, ready to shed their last drop of blood, while the old and weak weakly moan in fear and despair. This is a historical tragedy, a preliminary world massacre of imperialism seizing colonies. The famous American journalist Louis Fischer risked his life to go to Madrid at the height of the war, constantly reporting news from the besieged city to major magazines. This article is a dispatch recently sent by Fischer to the American weekly The Nation, describing the situation in the besieged city. It is very moving and is specially excerpted and translated here for readers.

Recently, the front line in Madrid has been quiet. Quiet is a relative term. Every night, when the noise of traffic in the city stops, I listen from my hotel window to the continuous sound of artillery fire and the sharp sound of machine guns, like ten thousand horses galloping on stone. True, the enemy's pressure has eased somewhat. This may be due to regrouping or waiting for reinforcements. Naturally, the heroic efforts of the government air force have also constrained General Franco's offensive.

Two to five thousand German soldiers, with their weapons, arrived in Cadix this week. According to military estimates here, Franco, after receiving their assistance, may soon launch another offensive. Yes, it has indeed already begun. Yesterday was Saturday, and I was strolling down the street when suddenly there was a loud bang—"A shell!" I said to myself. Then there was another similar loud bang, the sound so solid and sharp that I was shocked. I ran into a fashion store to buy some woolen socks (all the shops in Madrid still have large stocks of winter underwear, felt, and flannel clothing, but four kilometers away, the people defending the capital are wearing thin clothes and sleeping in frozen trenches). Several customers were discussing the loud bang. One said, "This is our artillery." But I couldn't imagine why the government would put artillery in the center of the city. I returned to the street. People were rushing around looking confused. The loud bangs grew louder and louder: thick smoke was billowing in the sky. Franco was bombing the center of Madrid. The shelling started again this morning, and as I write, I can hear the sound of shells destroying houses a few steps away. How do people maintain their composure in such an environment? I was awakened by the sound of artillery at seven o'clock. Naturally, my hotel may soon become a target for the gunners. Everyone wants to run to safety, but everyone is ashamed to flee.

General Franco, the supreme ruler of reactionary Spain, is very experienced in this strategy of attacking defenseless people. He has won many victories over the women and children of Madrid. Air raids on people's homes have become a daily occurrence. A person often looks at his watch and says, "It's four o'clock, they haven't come here yet." I have heard many air raids, and I have seen many air raid planes. I have inspected many places where bombs have exploded. I have also seen rescue work amidst the smoke and fire. But having experienced the air raid on Friday, I dare say that nothing in the world is as miserable and evil as this. Just before two o'clock in the afternoon, I was sitting in a car and I saw people running. The streets were immediately empty. Now I can hear the roar of the plane engines. Suddenly there was a crack, and in an instant, a mountain of smoke enveloped a five-story building from bottom to top.

Current Affairs Commentary

### An Economic Observation of the Japanese Political Turmoil

— Xing

The Hirota Cabinet in Japan was forced to resign due to the intensification of conflicts between political parties and the military. Now, although General Ugaki has been ordered to form a cabinet, the military is strongly opposed. The future of the political situation is still unpredictable. The crux of this political turmoil is clearly the military's attempt to establish a dictatorial government and implement control policies. From the perspective of the Japanese national economy, let's assess the military's claims.

First, in our observation, the biggest weakness of the Japanese military's claims is the lack of independence in national defense resources. Everyone knows that Japan's resources are extremely scarce. No matter what kind of raw material, it cannot be self-sufficient. Therefore, although Japan's net income from shipping and insurance each year is as high as 170 million yen, and its net income from investments each year is as high as 70 million yen, it is still in a difficult situation to use these incomes to cover its new military expenses abroad, new investments, and large trade deficits. If military preparations are expanded without limit, Japan's international balance will certainly be more difficult to maintain. Secondly, in terms of Japan's economic relations with other countries, Japan's total import and export volume from January to October 1936 was 4.4 billion yen. Among them, the import and export volume to the United States was 1.2 billion yen, and the total to the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and India was 1 billion yen. The sum of the two reached 2.2 billion yen, which accounts for half of Japan's total import and export volume. The trade relations between many other British and American colonies and Japan are not included. From the above figures, we can see how important Japan's economic relations with the United Kingdom and the United States are. If Japan's control policies are fully implemented and the Japanese national economy cannot develop freely, then not only will the reaction in the industrial and financial aspects be very large, but Japan's external economic relations will also inevitably be greatly affected. Third, in recent years, a movement of free circulation of markets has emerged among the world's democratic countries. They have gradually reduced all obstacles to free trade between them. This movement was initiated by the United States' reciprocal trade agreements, and has been promoted more smoothly after the establishment of the tripartite agreement between the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. Now, the economic relations between the world's democratic countries are becoming closer day by day. On the contrary, the economies of countries that implement highly controlled policies are shrinking day by day. In the face of these two major trends, the Japanese industrial and commercial classes have no choice but to choose the path of free market principles for their own interests.

The above three points can explain why the Japanese political parties this time are willing to oppose the military at any cost. Under such conditions, Japanese parliamentary politics does not seem to be completely declining. In the event that the Japanese political situation is absolutely controlled by the military, it would not only be a major crisis for Japan, but also have a terrible impact on the overall situation in the Far East.

### The Japanese Political Situation is Chaotic, Ugaki's Cabinet Formation Faces Difficulties

The atmosphere of military opposition is strong, refusing to recommend a candidate for Minister of the Army

[Tokyo] Judging from today's situation, the military's opposition to Ugaki's cabinet formation is still extremely strong. After completing his preliminary efforts to alleviate various conflicts, Ugaki visited Terauchi at 4:00 PM to inform him of the principles and future policies of his cabinet formation, hoping that the military would recommend a candidate for Minister of the Army. It is said that Terauchi did not give a definite answer. Ugaki then visited Nagano to convey the same intention. Nagano also did not express his opinion. It is rumored that the military has firmly decided not to recommend any candidate for Minister of the Army. If Ugaki makes this request to military leaders, they will refuse him in their personal capacity. This attitude has aroused criticism from all sides, saying that the military is violating the imperial prerogative. Regarding this point, the military issued a statement this afternoon, stating that it has absolutely no intention of violating the imperial prerogative, and that the military's non-participation in the Ugaki cabinet is out of fear of hindering the internal management of the military. However, some quarters believe that although there is a strong atmosphere of opposition in the military, which has created the impression that Ugaki will eventually fail, considering the general situation, a path of compromise is still possible, and the cabinet formation will only require a considerable amount of time. This observation is based on the following view: that in the current environment, there is no more suitable person than Ugaki. If Ugaki fails, it will lead to a more chaotic situation. At the same time, Ugaki, who is talented, experienced, and veteran, is still calmly and cautiously carrying out the cabinet formation work, confident that he will be successful. It is a very noteworthy phenomenon that extreme right-wing organizations have united today to actively attack Ugaki. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Tokyo] General Ugaki stayed at his Yotsuya residence from this morning to consider countermeasures for the cabinet formation, while on the other hand, the army's absolute opposition has become stronger and stronger since this morning, and it is making every effort to prevent General Ugaki from forming a cabinet. This afternoon, Ugaki met with the Minister of the Army and the Minister of the Navy, but there was no sign of any progress in the situation. The army insisted on its established strong policy and worked hard to the end. Therefore, Ugaki's cabinet formation is likely to miscarry, as it is currently facing a major difficulty. (25th Domei News Agency Dispatch)

[Tokyo] The cabinet formation work began to negotiate with the military for the first time on the afternoon of the 25th. However, regarding the selection of cabinet members, in view of the current situation, it should be handled with caution. Concrete negotiations have not yet begun tonight. According to the information released by the cabinet formation headquarters, "We do not intend to handle negotiation matters tonight." (25th Domei News Agency Dispatch)

### Reasons for Military Opposition

[Tokyo] The Japanese Ministry of the Army held an urgent meeting of its leaders last night and decided to oppose Ugaki's formation of a new cabinet. The reasons for this are that Ugaki has already recognized the need for military purification, so after Ugaki forms a cabinet, he will still implement his military purification plan, and the situation may become more critical than before. Furthermore, Ugaki belongs to the status quo faction, and his understanding of the current situation is completely different from that of the army. Therefore, the Ugaki cabinet will hinder the internal control of the military. It is generally believed that if the military insists on this attitude, the future of Ugaki's formation of a new cabinet will be even more serious and difficult. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Cabinet Formation Respects Constitutional Government

[Tokyo] General Ugaki intends to consult carefully with Imaida Seidoku and two or three of his confidants to start the cabinet formation. According to Ugaki's close associates, his cabinet formation policy is roughly as follows:

㊀ The new cabinet will of course respect parliamentary politics, but since there are many points in the existing political parties that need to be reformed, the parliament must be dissolved. ㊁ When selecting cabinet members, in order to make a fresh start in administration, six or seven cabinet members will be decided first and temporarily concurrently serve as ministers of other provinces, and a part of them will be re-elected in the general election. ㊂ When the authorities of the Army and Navy put forward their long-standing claims as conditions, all of them will be accepted. ㊃ Cabinet members will not be employed by political parties. If cabinet members are employed by political parties, talent should be respected and they should enter the cabinet in their personal capacity. (25th Domei News Agency Dispatch)

### All Parties Express Goodwill to Ugaki's Cabinet Formation

Political Parties and Business Circles Unanimously Support. Public Opinion Hopes for Careful Selection of Cabinet Members.

[Tokyo] If Ugaki's cabinet can be realized, both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, regardless of whether their members enter the cabinet or not, will certainly jointly assist the new cabinet. The reason for the dissolution of the parliament will also disappear, and dissolution may be avoided. (25th Domei News Agency Dispatch)

[Tokyo] The Minseito party has expressed sympathy for General Ugaki's candidacy. Many of the party's leaders have always been members of the Ugaki faction, and the party's opinion is that they hope Ugaki will stand for election. However, it is still questionable whether the party will demand cooperation when he forms a cabinet. If General Ugaki can overcome the current troubles based on the true meaning of constitutional politics and the overall will of the people, then it will not be long before he forms a cabinet. (26th Domei News Agency Dispatch)

[Tokyo] Since Ugaki Kazushige received the imperial mandate to form a cabinet, all parties in Japan have expressed goodwill. The Minseito party's active support for Ugaki and the Seiyukai's friendly and neutral attitude seem to have been determined. The House of Peers also recognizes Ugaki as the most suitable person to succeed the Prime Minister. The business community also welcomes Ugaki, believing that Ugaki is sufficient to ease the conflicts of various opposing camps and delay the realization of the rightward shift of the Japanese political system. This morning, all newspapers expressed their support for this experienced general, believing that Ugaki's appointment as Prime Minister is the most appropriate and that no one can compare with him. The Asahi Shimbun's commentary stated that the only concern at present is the opposition of some military personnel, but after the implementation of military purification, active-duty military personnel shall not interfere in politics. Therefore, after Ugaki receives the imperial mandate, he should not be opposed any further, and the army does not seem to refuse to recommend a successor for the Minister of the Army. The Nichinichi Shimbun expressed hope that the Ugaki cabinet will first clear the haze that permeates the political world, and then further clarify politics, so as to express the general wishes of the people. The Yomiuri Shimbun said that the Ugaki cabinet is not as careful as the Hirota cabinet in selecting cabinet members, because Ugaki has too many subordinates and related parties, and it may take a lot of difficulties to select bright and capable cabinet members. It is hoped that Ugaki will pay special attention to this point. The Hochi Shimbun's commentary stated that Ugaki will express his political vision and his degree of understanding of the current situation when selecting cabinet members, so he must have a decisive determination and careful consideration, and special attention must be paid to the selection of the Minister of the Army, the Minister of the Navy, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the Minister of Finance, as they are extremely important to Japan's international relations and the stability of the people's lives. The Chugai Shogyo Shimbun's commentary stated that although Ugaki is from a military background, he lacks harmonious relations with the Ministry of the Army. If there is any danger, the crux is in this. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Speculation on New Cabinet Members

[Tokyo] After General Ugaki received the imperial mandate to form a cabinet, he began forming the cabinet on the morning of the 25th. According to general observations, Imaida Tsutoku, who was the Director-General of Political Affairs when General Ugaki was the Governor-General of Korea and assisted Ugaki in implementing his administration, will serve as the Minister of Communications or the Minister of Colonial Affairs. However, Imaida has stated that he is unwilling to join the cabinet. As for the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs, the former ambassador to France, Sato Naotake, and the former envoy to China and ambassador to Germany, Obata Yūkichi, have a high voice. However, there is also a theory of appointing General Matsui Iwane or Matsuoka Yōsuke to break the diplomatic deadlock. According to another theory, the Prime Minister concurrently serves as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Yoshida Shigeru or Horikiri Zenjirō will likely take office as the Minister of Home Affairs. Yūki Toyotaro's entry into the cabinet is almost certain, but it is not possible to predict whether he will be the Minister of Finance or the Minister of Railways. As for the ministers of the military, since the army is strongly opposed to Ugaki, their candidates are attracting general attention. Sugiyama's general director of education, Koiso's lieutenant general commander of the Korean army, Kazuki's lieutenant general commander of the Konoe division, and Itagaki's lieutenant general chief of staff of the Kwantung army are all noteworthy. The theory that the former military councillor, Admiral Suetsugu, will take office as the Minister of the Navy is the most powerful. The Ministry of Justice hopes that Minister of Justice Hayashi will stay in office. Among those who enter the cabinet from the political parties are Nakajima Kuhira, Hatoyama Ichiro, Sakurai Yukio, and Nagai Ryūtarō, and from the House of Peers, Kabayama Aisuke. In addition, at the time of cabinet formation, in order to implement the merger or abolition of provinces in the future, one person may concurrently serve as two or three ministers. Matsumoto Gaku, the former Director of the Police Security Bureau, Ikeda Kiyoshi, the governor of Hokkaido, and Yasui Seiichirō, the director of the General Affairs Bureau, may take positions such as Chief Secretary, Director-General of the Legislative Bureau, and Superintendent General of the Metropolitan Police Department. (25th Domei News Agency Dispatch)

### Navy Observes Quietly

[Tokyo] The Navy authorities are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards Ugaki's appointment to form a cabinet. According to the Navy's opinion, if the leader of the succeeding cabinet can overcome the current difficulties, stabilize the political situation, and have strong control, then regardless of which party he is from, he can be supported. Regarding General Ugaki, since his policies and beliefs for opening up the current situation have not been heard, it is intended to temporarily observe the development of the situation. (25th Domei News Agency Dispatch)

### Business Circles Anxious

[Tokyo] The business community is paying close attention to General Ugaki's cabinet formation work, believing that a cabinet miscarriage is the worst possible situation. If the difficult birth continues, the military's various conditions may be accommodated. It is also now being considered that the weakening of the new cabinet is considered inevitable and is quite worrying. However, since there is no active atmosphere in all aspects, it is hoped that the Ugaki cabinet will be born quickly in order to stabilize the political situation and restore the economy to normal. This voice is extremely widespread. (25th Domei News Agency Dispatch)

### Right-Wing Groups Urge Ugaki to Resign from Cabinet Formation

[Tokyo] The Current Affairs Council of Right-Wing Groups convened a general meeting of initiators at its headquarters at 3:00 PM on the 25th. Irie Tanemori, Takekawa Biji, and others attended and resolved as follows:

Ugaki, who came from the army, should be familiar with the current situation of the military, but this time he formed a cabinet regardless of everything, which is considered inappropriate. It is hoped that he will be persuaded to resign from the imperial mandate.

The above resolution will be handed over to Ugaki in person. In addition, the Patriotic Labor Comrades Association also convened a national conference of 45 branches this morning and issued instructions, and unanimously resolved to absolutely oppose the Ugaki cabinet and urge it to resign from the imperial mandate, and telegraphed the cabinet formation headquarters to express the situation of the conference resolution. (25th Domei News Agency Dispatch)

### Parliament Adjourned

Until the New Cabinet is Established

[Tokyo] The House of Representatives held a general meeting at 1:00 PM on the 25th. After the opening of the meeting, a huge wave was aroused, which eventually led to the total resignation of the cabinet. Therefore, members of the Seiyu and Minsei parties and various factions took their seats with tension. The cabinet member seats were empty. Speaker Tomita rose and said that on the 25th, he received a notice of the cabinet's total resignation and a request to adjourn the meeting until the new cabinet is established. When asked in the meeting hall, Tabuchi Toyokichi rose to object, and two or three other members agreed with him. The speaker did not take it seriously and considered it passed without objection. He announced the adjournment at 1:10 PM. (25th Domei News Agency Dispatch)

[Tokyo] The House of Peers convened a meeting at 11:00 AM this morning. Speaker Konoe proposed that since the Hirota cabinet had resigned and the succeeding cabinet had not yet been established, the meeting should be temporarily adjourned. With the unanimous agreement, the meeting was adjourned immediately. (25th Domei News Agency Dispatch)

### U.S. Official Circles Do Not Offer Criticism

But Value Ugaki as a Person, Saying He Has the Demeanor of a Statesman

[Washington] Official circles here refuse to criticize the Japanese political turmoil, fearing that the U.S. government will interfere in Japan's internal affairs. However, the U.S. officials value General Ugaki, who has been mandated to form a cabinet, and believe that he has the demeanor of a statesman and can adapt to circumstances. Therefore, his policies can be both lenient and strict. (24th National Telegram)

### Premier Blum's Speech Causes Repercussions in Germany

The Principle of Indivisible Peace Considered Insufficient to Resolve the European Situation

[Berlin] The initial reactions in German political circles to the speech given by French Premier Léon Blum are generally as follows: German political circles are satisfied with Léon Blum's statement that France does not intend to offer Germany any sort of haggling proposition. They are particularly pleased with Blum's statement that "France does not wish to exploit Germany's dire economic situation as a means of exerting political pressure on Germany." However, political figures say, "Léon Blum's attitude toward various major political issues does not allow us to agree. Léon Blum opposes entering into bilateral agreements while simultaneously declaring that France is willing to remain loyal to all friendly nations. These two positions are mutually contradictory. In short, 'indivisible peace' is not the only effective solution, and those who abuse the principle of international collective security are not other countries but rather France's own allies. These allies have no intention of reaching an understanding with Germany. It is regrettable that France is now lending them funds to expand their military strength. Moreover, there are reasons to doubt whether Germany has good intentions toward other countries. Germany seeks to gain freedom and equality in armaments through its own efforts, and merely does not wish to be subject to the dictates of other countries." Political figures also stated, "Bilateral agreements concluded between Germany and other countries can satisfy both sides. For example, the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact (signed on January 26, 1934, for a term of ten years), the German-Austrian Agreement (signed on July 11, 1936), the Anglo-German Naval Agreement (signed on June 18, 1935), and the understanding between Germany and Italy have all contributed to resolving European problems. Conversely, the Franco-Soviet Pact of Mutual Assistance is a genuine danger to Europe." Overall, while taking a reserved attitude toward the French Premier's speech, political figures still insisted that Germany is committed to cooperating with other countries and considered Blum's expressed willingness to engage in frank talks with Germany to be a welcome development. However, they believed that past methods should not be reused, otherwise, they will become trapped in a circular argument with no way out. (Havas, 24th)

[Berlin] Today, an official German critic commented on French Premier Blum's speech in Lyon yesterday, which stated that "the key to peace in Europe lies in Germany." The critic said that the wording of Blum's speech regarding Germany was very friendly and contained no attacks. The critic expressed satisfaction with Blum's belief that Hitler's repeated declarations of peace were sincere. It was stated that Germany cannot recognize the demand for indivisible peace as the only effective method of security, and believes that those who abuse the collective security system are all friends and allies of France. Germany's willingness to cooperate is unlimited. Now that Blum has declared that France is ready to have thorough discussions with Germany, it is a good omen for the future. Blum's speech yesterday was quite unexpected by the newspapers. Blum denied any intention of making a surprising new economic appeal to Germany. Blum declared that the People's Front is becoming stronger and more vibrant, and has proven that a stable government has the ability to protect its national interests and security. Blum reiterated his opposition to bilateral agreements and insisted on the principle of indivisible peace. Blum also supported the suggestion that countries could provide economic assistance to Germany if a peaceful resolution to the European situation could be achieved, but opposed making any demands of Germany that resembled a transaction. Blum also said that the general perception that Germany's economic problems might one day force it to seek aid from foreign countries and be willing to submit to various conditions is illusory and extremely dangerous. On the other hand, it must be understood that an economic agreement cannot be separated from a political solution. France is willing to cooperate, and if Germany also expresses a willingness to cooperate, then France is ready to work with it. Blum concluded that a convention on limiting and reducing armaments is a necessary part of resolving the overall European situation. However, today, the arms manufacturing industry occupies such an important position in national industry that it would be impossible to simply order a halt to arms manufacturing without causing a serious domestic panic. Today, it may be impossible to implement a convention on reducing armaments without supplementary economic agreements. (Reuters, 25th)

### Excerpts from British and French Newspaper Commentary

[London] The newspapers are deeply impressed by the speech given by French Premier Blum in Lyon yesterday, saying that the clear and honest attitude with which he explained France's position is what makes the speech so moving. It is particularly gratifying that the position explained by Blum is completely consistent with that articulated by British Foreign Secretary Eden in his speech on the 19th of this month. It is now up to Germany to state its position. The News Chronicle reported, "Blum's speech complements the shortcomings of Foreign Secretary Eden's speech. What he proposed is neither to haggle with Germany nor to bribe that country. It should be understood that any country that harbors doubts that if it provides economic assistance to a neighboring country, that neighbor might use that assistance to attack it, would naturally be unwilling to rashly assist the neighbor and bring trouble upon itself. What France is now asking of Germany is not to abandon its legitimate demands, but to abandon its policy of armed isolation, which is of no benefit to that country." The Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, stated that "Premier Blum's explanation that there is no intention to haggle, so as not to cause misunderstandings among a nation with a proud spirit and keen sensibilities, is wise and commendable. Moreover, Premier Blum's disagreement with some people's doubts about German leader Hitler's repeatedly solemn declarations of peaceful intentions is also a sign of his wisdom. In short, Blum's speech deserves to be called frank and fair." (Havas, 25th)

[Paris] All newspapers, except for the right-wing Paris Echo, warmly welcomed Premier Blum's speech in Lyon yesterday, saying that the theory articulated by the Premier is impeccable. The centrist Republican Newspaper reported, "The Premier's statement that he does not wish to negotiate bilateral agreements with Germany will inevitably lead German newspapers to accuse French foreign policy of being influenced by the Communist Party. But this is not the case. The French government is not controlled by the Moscow government." The right-wing Figaro reported that "what Premier Blum said yesterday is the true public opinion of France." The right-wing Friend of the People reported that the Premier's proposals are theoretically perfect, "but it is not known whether they can be implemented in the future." The moderate Order reported that "the Premier's declarations on foreign policy, especially on Franco-German relations, are indeed based on political realities." The Socialist People's Newspaper and the Communist Humanity commented on the domestic impact of the Premier's speech. The People's Newspaper reported that "the organization of the People's Front will obviously become stronger." Humanity used the phrase "the unity of the People's Front is stronger today than ever before" as its headline. The newspaper also published a dispatch from its diplomatic correspondent in Geneva stating that "as far as we know, this speech has been well-received internationally, which is only natural." Only the right-wing Paris Echo took a different tone, saying that "domestic and foreign audiences who hear the Premier's speech should feel disappointed." (Havas, 25th)

At the same time, it is reported that France is not conducting any loan negotiations with the United States. (Reuters, 25th)

### Italy and Germany Suggest Ban on Volunteer Soldiers Going to Spain by Submitting Reply Notes

The wording and content are largely the same

[Rome] Regarding the prohibition of volunteer soldiers going to Spain to serve, the Italian government delivered a reply note to the British Embassy at 11:00 AM today, stating that the Italian government is prepared to take various appropriate measures regarding the prohibition of recruiting and dispatching volunteer soldiers to Spain, provided that other countries accept the same approach. It also stated that the Italian government has previously made a request, advocating that all foreign volunteer soldiers within Spain be completely withdrawn. As for the method of monitoring the country's land and sea borders, the Italian government's views will be presented at a later date. In addition, the Italian representative to the Non-Intervention Committee is currently drafting a detailed plan to remove political agitators within Spain, so as to make the non-intervention policy complete and flawless. However, if the Spanish Valencia government allows foreign volunteer soldiers to change their nationality to circumvent the government's obligations under the non-intervention policy, the Italian government will raise a reservation. (Havas, 25th)

[Berlin] The German government's reply note to the British government is worded almost identically to the Italian reply, agreeing to take the same action when other major powers prohibit volunteer soldiers from going to Spain, and suggesting the withdrawal of all foreigners participating in the Spanish Civil War, including political agitators. (Reuters, 25th)

### Situation of the Russian Counter-Revolution Case Trial

Defendants Give Detailed Confessions of Conspiracy to Overthrow the Current Regime

[Moscow] Political commentator Radek admitted yesterday that he had conspired with anti-faction leader Trotsky and others to assassinate Stalin, but today he attempted to avoid the death penalty, claiming that he did not accept Trotsky's final instruction that Germany and Japan should help him overthrow Stalin. He also confessed that "I know I am guilty. I bear moral, legal, and political responsibility for the terrorist group. Former senior official Bukharin was also involved in the conspiracy." Radek also named foreign ambassadors and consuls involved in the case twice, which angered the judge. (National Military News, 24th)

[Moscow] Today is the second day of the public trial of the traitors. Many prominent figures attended the court, including the ambassadors of Britain, France, and the United States, when the defendant Radek confessed that he had consulted with senior diplomats about a plan to divide the Soviet Union. The session lasted four hours. All seventeen defendants pleaded guilty on the first day of the trial and are now facing the death penalty. Although Radek was warned by the presiding judge, he continued to mention the names of foreign diplomats from time to time until the judge threatened to adjourn the court. Radek confessed that he realized in 1935 that a Russo-German war was inevitable due to Hitler's ambitions, and that Russia would be defeated in the war. Therefore, he pursued a Machiavellian policy, promising to cede Ukraine to Germany and the Amur region to Japan, and to cooperate with German military staff during the war. This would weaken Russia after the war and make another revolution possible. He had received three letters from Trotsky. The first letter, written in April 1934, stated that German fascism was gaining strength, the situation in the Far East was becoming more serious, and war was approaching, the result of which Russia would be defeated and would create a situation where their group could seize power. Therefore, for the benefit of their group, they should promote the early outbreak of war. The second letter, written in December 1935, outlined the procedure for restoring capitalism and granting land and economic concessions to fascist countries after Russia's defeat.

Former Ambassador to Britain Sokolnikov confessed that he had committed the crime of conspiring with Germany and Japan to overthrow Russia, because of their belief as "defeatists" that German fascism would plunge Germany and Russia into a dead end. He believed that rather than being completely destroyed in the future, it would be better to abandon socialism early and unite with the fascists. The prosecutor then asked Sokolnikov whether Germany would tolerate their government once it occupied Ukraine. Sokolnikov replied that they would rely on other capitalist countries to prevent Germany from advancing further. Later, the Washington correspondent of the News, Romm, testified that he had delivered Trotsky's letter to Radek. (Reuters, 25th)

### Severe Flooding in the United States

Rivers Continue to Rise, Disaster Area Covers Twelve States, Oil Tanks Destroyed, Large Fire Breaks Out in Cincinnati Industrial Area

[New York] The Ohio River is still rising, and the Meteorological Bureau says it is impossible to predict when the river will stop rising. In Louisville, Kentucky, the river has risen more than 15.7 meters, which is 1.5 meters higher than the height of 14.2 meters during the great flood of 1884. A large fire has broken out in the industrial area of Cincinnati, Ohio. In addition, oil pools were broken by water and oil floats on the water surface. The fire is raging, and the flames are as high as 100 meters. The city's fire brigade is currently working hard to put out the fire. (Havas, 24th)

[New York] Severe flooding in the central and eastern states of the United States has caused a serious disaster. The disaster area covers twelve states, and 400,000 people have been left homeless. The losses are incalculable, and 75 people have died. Scarlet fever and pneumonia have broken out in Ohio and Kentucky, affecting about 100 people. There is widespread concern about the outbreak of an epidemic. Looting of shops has also occurred in Portsmouth, Ohio. In Cincinnati, Ohio, oil pools were broken by water, and oil floats on the water surface. The fire spread and burned down part of the city's houses. The fire brigade tried hard to put out the fire for several hours, but the disaster was horrific with the water followed by fire. A total of 42 houses were burned down and 1,500 were flooded. At that time, it was raining heavily and continuously, and the streets were ankle-deep in water. The total loss is estimated at US$1.5 million. In addition, oil flows on the surface of the Ohio River, so other states are also at risk of fire. At this moment, the Ohio River is 16 meters high and is still rising. In some parts of Louisville, Kentucky, the water is as high as 10 meters. The power plant has also been flooded and the power has been cut off. The entire city has become a dark world, and 300,000 residents are now preparing to move elsewhere to avoid drowning. New Albany, Indiana, has almost completely become a swamp. Residents in Jeffersonville have also been completely evacuated. Authorities in Indianapolis have declared martial law. Authorities in Tennessee ordered the levee to be breached to allow the water to flow into the depression and reduce the impact of the flood. As a result, 53,000 hectares of farmland will become a swamp. The farmers in the area were terrified and formed groups armed with weapons to patrol the levee all night, not allowing the levee to be breached and the fields to be flooded. The reformatory in Frankfort, Tennessee, has been flooded. The prisoners in the reformatory feared drowning and attempted to escape. Twelve of them were shot and killed. Three hundred people drowned in Memphis. There is a small island in the Mississippi River outside the city, and 14 people took refuge there, but their situation was miserable. After receiving reports of the disaster, President Roosevelt was deeply saddened. He immediately consulted with officials from the Federal Relief Administration, officials from the Red Cross, officers from the Army and Navy, and leaders of the Coast Guard. It was decided that he would personally preside over the relief efforts and ordered his staff to report on the disaster at any time without error. So far, a large number of tents, medical supplies, and 4,500 soldiers have been transported to the disaster area to carry out relief efforts. (Havas, 24th)

### The Full Extent of the Food Panic in Guangdong

Thirty Million Cantonese People Face the Threat of Starvation

Guangzhou Correspondence. Food in Guangdong Province can be broadly categorized into three types: plant, animal, and mineral. Plants include rice, wheat, beans, peanuts, sweet potatoes, etc. Animals include poultry, livestock, fish, shellfish, etc. Minerals are mainly salt. Among these, rice, a plant, is the staple food. As the saying goes, "Southerners eat rice, northerners eat wheat," which shows the importance of rice and wheat to the diet of Guangdong. However, in terms of its own food supply, only salt is produced in large quantities, and meat can be self-sufficient. The most important rice is severely lacking and always needs to be imported. Since the founding of the Republic of China, this province has imported large quantities of food every year from abroad and domestically. Rice is the most imported, followed by flour and other grains. Imports from abroad mostly come from Annam, Siam, Australia, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies. Those imported from other provinces are mostly from Anhui, Guangxi, Shandong, Hunan, Jiangxi, and the four northeastern provinces. According to customs statistics, Guangdong Province imported over 179.8 million dan of foreign rice and grains from the 22nd year of the Republic of China (from the first year to the 22nd year), worth over 78.8 million taels of customs silver. On average, more than 8.1 million dan were imported annually, worth over 35 million taels of customs silver. In addition, the amount of domestic rice imported from other provinces is also considerable. In total, over the past 22 years, an average of over 2 million dan have been imported annually, worth over 9 million taels of customs silver, with Anhui rice accounting for half of it, and the rest being Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Hunan rice. Judging by this, the combined import volume of foreign and domestic rice averages about 10 million dan per year. It is evident that the rice production in Guangdong is low and the food problem is serious.

A Glimpse of the Famine

The supply and demand situation of rice in Guangdong Province is roughly as described above. Therefore, if crops fail or foreign rice imports decrease, a famine will immediately appear. Recently, due to drought and floods, rice fields in various counties have suffered crop failures. In addition, after import tariffs on foreign rice were levied in accordance with the central government's regulations, the source of supply was suddenly blocked. Consequently, supply fell short of demand, and rice prices rose daily. The price of low-grade brown rice, which used to be 13 catties per yuan, now needs to be doubled. That is, one yuan can only buy more than 6 catties. The price of grain per stone has also risen from over 4 yuan per hundred catties to over 9 yuan. The high rice price has broken the highest record of the past 20 years. The public suffers from this and groans in pain, telling each other in horror, and is restless all day long. The people in the counties have already felt extremely poor due to rural bankruptcy and frequent natural disasters. Coupled with the severity of the rice famine, they inevitably fall into a state of starvation. In severe cases, such as in Nanhai, Gaoming, Shunde, and Sanshui counties, famine-stricken people have even started robbing rice. Even in Zhongshan, which is known as a model county, people are eating sugar and dirt due to the rice famine. The miserable situation is self-evident.

The Situation in Guangzhou

As for Guangzhou City, although it is a prosperous metropolis, the general public also feels overwhelmed, especially those who have no rice stored at home and will inevitably face food shortages and the threat of starvation. As a result, social order is becoming increasingly uneasy. The observable impacts are roughly as follows: ㊀ Rice prices have been rising for days, and poor people in the city gather in front of rice shops, lamenting and sighing, which has become a common sight. As a result, the theft of rice is rampant. In order to prevent the poor from robbing and stealing, rice merchants store all large quantities of rice in warehouses or back rooms and dare not place them in the shops. The rice baskets displayed in front of the shops are all covered with wire mesh to prevent anyone from taking advantage of the situation to rob and steal. The precautions are extremely strict. ㊁ The food-saving movement of the poor laborers. The soaring rice prices hit the poor in the labor sector first. Originally, each person ate two jiao of rice per day, but now it costs four jiao. Families with several members are even worse off, but their labor income has not increased. Therefore, many people work hard all day long but cannot get enough to eat. As a result, a food-saving movement has recently become popular. For example, poor people in the areas of Dabe, Xiaobei, Zhuhengsha, and Dongsha mostly eat rice for one meal and sweet potatoes and taro for the other. They can save a small amount of money for rice every day and change to eating miscellaneous grains to fill their stomachs. ㊂ Under the shroud of economic depression and the long-term high price of rice, small-capital businesses and handicraftsmen in the city, unable to afford the increased food expenses, have dismissed the short-term and casual workers they hired in order to save expenses. Even middle-class households have dismissed the servants they employed for the same reason. The number of unemployed people in the city has increased sharply as a result. Compared with the end of last year, it has increased by at least 10,000. The crowding in employment agencies looking for work is also unprecedented. ㊃ Due to the sharp increase in the number of unemployed people and the high cost of rice, the trend of eating "blessed food" for free is becoming increasingly popular. It is said that groups of three to five people have formed to beg for food from shops. The police are also overwhelmed. The industry has been severely affected by this and has reported to the trade association to find ways to ban it. ㊄ The impoverished people from suburban villages have united to enter the city in search of food. In the villages in the northeast suburbs, a rice famine has recently occurred, and many impoverished people have suffered starvation. They have been entering the city in droves for days, begging for food from shops. Some are supporting the elderly and leading the young, wandering everywhere, and they are all from the surrounding villages. Most of them are emaciated and miserable. All of these phenomena are sufficient to reflect the extreme panic and turmoil in society. As for the amount of rice stored in the city, according to the survey, there are 574 rice shops in the city, with only over 3.93 million catties of rice in stock, which is only enough for a few days. The serious situation is particularly worrying. With the end of the year approaching and winter defense being urgent, the people are unable to make a living, and the future of social order is unimaginable.

Appeals from the Authorities

After investigation, the causes of the rice famine in Guangdong Province are very complex. The main reason is that crop yields in the province have decreased sharply due to natural disasters, and rice production has been greatly reduced. It is inevitable that imports are needed to supplement the supply. However, due to the heavy taxes, foreign rice merchants are afraid and have stopped importing. Rice from other provinces cannot be supplied steadily due to transportation difficulties, resulting in this famine. The military and political authorities of this province deeply feel that the crisis is imminent. At this time of the year-end and tight winter defense, the maintenance of social order is worrying everywhere. Therefore, various agencies have jointly formed a civil food regulation committee with the banking community to engage in civil food regulation work as a temporary solution. In addition, Director of Pacification Yu Hanmou and Chairman of the Provincial Government Huang Musong have repeatedly telegraphed the central government, earnestly appealing to them to consider the difficult situation of civil food and approve the exemption of import tariffs on foreign rice. At the same time, they have urged rice from neighboring provinces to be transported to Guangdong in a continuous stream in order to suppress rice prices and save this disaster. Provincial and municipal party headquarters and various community organizations have also telegraphed their response, earnestly requesting the central government to adopt their request in order to maintain the people's food supply.

Relief Measures

Since the establishment of the Civil Food Regulation Committee, it has been committed to planning civil food regulation methods. The committee has held repeated meetings and discussed many relief plans, which are being implemented in order. At the same time, it has sent personnel to Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces to purchase large quantities of rice. It has also sponsored the banking community in this province to establish a rice pledge syndicate to be responsible for the purchase, transportation, and storage of food. The total amount of the pledge is set at 4 million yuan. The central, Chinese, transportation, farmers, Shanghai National Products, Central and Southern Salt Industry, Jincheng, Guohua, Guangdong Dongya and other banks, provincial and municipal banks, Guangxi Provincial Bank, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau are allocating the amount of burden as appropriate to contribute to the progress. In addition, the Guangzhou Branch of the National Economic Construction Movement Committee also believes that civil food is closely related to the national economy. It has specially convened economic experts and relevant parties to hold a symposium on civil food issues and discuss them in detail. The following decisions were made: ㊀ Request the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Finance to completely exempt the foreign rice tax, temporarily for six months. ㊁ Request the Executive Yuan to order the authorities of the four provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan to stop rice merchants from hoarding. ㊂ Request the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Railways to fully supply rice transportation vehicles and reduce transportation costs. ㊃ Request the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Transportation to instruct the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to reduce rice transportation costs. ㊄ Request the central government to reiterate the ban on the export of domestic rice until recently. Regarding the request of this province to exempt the foreign rice tax, the central government has decided to allocate vehicles from the Yuehan Railway to transport Hunan rice to Guangdong and to allow the Civil Food Regulation Committee to purchase and transport foreign rice, with half of the customs duties recorded on the books, with an amount of 300,000 metric tons. An order was issued to the local authorities of this province to comply. The Pacification Commissioner's Office and the Provincial Government, upon receiving this order, immediately drafted and announced the flexible measures for purchasing and transporting rice. The content is as follows: ㊀ Merchants and people may freely operate the purchase of foreign rice in accordance with these measures. ㊁ When foreign rice purchased passes through the coastal ports, only half of the customs duties that should be paid shall be paid, and the remaining half shall be recorded on the books, which shall be borne by the provincial government. ㊂ Merchants and people who purchase foreign rice shall report the quantity of rice purchased, the amount of tax paid in cash, and the amount recorded on the books to the Food Regulation Committee for verification. ㊃ All matters related to the purchase and transportation of rice shall be supervised and managed by the Food Regulation Committee. Currently, all sectors of this province believe that food relief is urgent. In order to quickly solve the rice famine problem, they will jointly hold a Rice Famine Relief Conference on the 23rd to discuss further effective measures. It has been decided on the spot to promote the provincial and municipal party headquarters, the provincial and municipal chambers of commerce, the provincial and municipal education associations, the rice industry association, the food association, the banking association, the civil industry association, the general machinery union, the shipping association, the seamen's union, the civilian shipping union, the Guangzhou office of the Yuehan Railway Bureau, the special party headquarters of the Yuehan Railway, the municipal reporters' association, the daily newspaper association, and the women's association. 19 groups will jointly form the Civil Food Relief Committee and telegraph the central government: ㊀ Increase the amount of tax-free foreign rice. ㊁ Order the rice-producing provinces such as Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei to immediately transport rice to Guangdong and restrict them from collecting export taxes. ㊂ Order the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to allocate more ships to transport rice to Guangdong and exempt transportation costs. ㊃ Order the Ministry of Railways to fully supply rice transportation vehicles and reduce transportation costs. The text of the telegram submitted by the association to the central government is attached below: Nanjing Central Party Headquarters National Government Executive Yuan Ministry of Finance: The rice situation in Guangdong is alarming. The Executive Yuan and the Ministry have approved the purchase of 300,000 metric tons of foreign rice with half tax recorded on the books. We in Guangdong are grateful for this great kindness, but after assessing the actual situation, it is still not enough to solve the current predicament. Today, a Rice Famine Relief Conference was held by all sectors of society. It was resolved to establish the Guangdong Civil Food Relief Committee, and unanimously appealed for the temporary full exemption of foreign rice tax so that rice from Vietnam and Siam can be quickly imported. Please also reduce or exempt steamship and train transportation costs and find ways to urge Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces to transport rice to Guangdong as soon as possible to alleviate the crisis. Respectfully telegraphed appeal, please approve. The Guangdong All Sectors Rice Famine Relief Conference Koutou.

### Heavy Sales Tax on Imports in Jiangxi Province

Sales Tax is Like a Local Levy, All Sectors Petition to Abolish It

Jiujiang Correspondence. Since Jiangxi Province suffered from banditry, the production of goods has decreased sharply, and purchasing power has declined. The trade volume of imports and exports from Jiujiang has been declining. The total trade volume in the 17th year of the Republic of China was 69,115,951 customs taels, but in the 21st year, it was only 37,028,850 customs taels. However, the local authorities of this province also added a production and sales rehabilitation tax in that year, levying a special tax of 2.5% to 15% on all imported and exported goods. Although all sectors have argued with the authorities that a local levy similar to this should not be created after the central government abolished the local levy, it was ineffective. The amount of donations collected over the years has been over 2 million yuan. Last year, the authorities believed that the export of goods was dwindling and that little was collected. The production tax was abolished, but the amount of donations not only did not decrease, but increased more than before due to the increase in the sales tax. The current annual revenue is about 2.8 million yuan. All goods imported from Jiujiang and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway are unpacked and inspected by the sales tax bureau, and revalued. They are only released after the tax is collected. If there is any concealment or omission, a heavy fine of 50 times the amount will be imposed. Currently, all industries in Jiujiang and Nanchang believe that the market is sluggish and cannot bear this burden. If it is passed on to consumers, the cost will increase and sales will be affected. It has been decided to contact fellow villagers in Beijing and Shanghai again to petition the central government to abolish the sales tax, which is a disguised form of local levy, so that the cost of all imported goods can be reduced by 10%, which will benefit the future of commerce and the livelihood of civilians. (January 21)

### Continued Report on the Shandong Match Industry Dispute

The United Office went to Jinan to petition, and the result was satisfactory. Chairman Han agreed to telegram Mayor Shen to find another solution.

Qingdao Correspondence. Eighteen match factories in Shandong, Luxi, Zhendong, etc., jointly organized an office because the articles of association of the National Match Production and Sales Joint Corporation and the agreement signed with foreign merchants had monopolistic and power-losing aspects, unanimously opposed it, and telegraphed the Shandong Provincial Government, Qingdao Municipal Government, and the Nanjing Executive Yuan and Supervision Yuan for appeals. They also elected representatives to go to Jinan to meet Chairman Han to petition. It is now known that the representatives returned to Qingdao from Jinan this morning (24th). According to reports, the results of the petition in Jinan were satisfactory, and there may be another solution in the future. The details of Mayor Shen's mediation process and this petition to Jinan are recorded as follows:

Mediation Process

Since the National Match Industry Association convened the second interim representative meeting in Shanghai in March of last year and passed the articles of association and other plans for the joint corporation, the merchants believed that the articles of association and the agreement of the joint corporation were illegal and power-losing, and it was difficult to accept them. They put forward their opinions as fellow traders, first questioning the Qingdao branch and then sending representatives to Shanghai to request the general corporation to amend them. They ran around to negotiate, but to no avail. In September of last year, Mayor Shen Honglie mediated the solution. At that time, Chairman Liu Hongsheng of the Shanghai General Corporation came to Qingdao, and the two parties convened representatives at the municipal government to discuss a solution. The conditions put forward by the representatives of the joint office were: 1. Join the corporation first, retain it for three months to amend the articles of association and the agreement. After the articles of association and the agreement are amended and submitted for registration, the share capital and expenses will be handed over to the corporation. Otherwise, they will not be restricted by the articles of association and may withdraw from the corporation at any time. 2. The production quota of each factory shall be distributed equally according to all the machines of each factory in the country and the annual output of all the factories in the country. However, all small factories must rise and not fall in order to provide relief. 3. Two directors of the general and branch corporations must be elected from the 18 merchants, and one supervisor and one manager of the branch corporation may be elected. Mayor Shen then proposed a compromise solution based on the above three conditions. 1. Agreed to do it. 2. Calculate the production quota according to twice the amount promised by Liu Hongsheng, and allow the small factories to rise and not fall in order to maintain their survival. 3. Allow the 18 merchants to elect one director of the general and branch corporations and one general manager of the branch. At that time, Liu did not adopt the compromise solution proposed by Shen, resulting in the failure to reach a result. Therefore, the joint business fell into a stalemate. On January 9 of this year, the merchants received a letter from the joint general corporation, which was instructed by the Ministry of Finance. The letter stated that the Ministry convened a meeting at the Taxation Department on November 16 and 17 of the 25th year with the participation of personnel from the Ministry of Industry, and notified the company to have responsible personnel attend to explain the situation. The two ministries discussed and decided to limit all Chinese match factories to join the joint venture by January 20 of this year. Otherwise, the Ministry of Industry would cancel its registration, and the Ministry of Finance would stop selling flowers and issuing licenses. The merchants believed that their survival was at stake, so they held an emergency meeting a few days ago. In addition to telegraphing the authorities for appeals, they also sent representatives Yu Jiesan, Li Jianzhai, Guo Xinshan, Zhang Ziyu, and Sun Donghai to Jinan to petition Chairman Han of the Shandong Provincial Government.

Petition Result

After arriving in Jinan, the representatives visited Chairman Han of the Shandong Provincial Government and Director Zhang of the Construction Department on the 22nd of this month to explain the intentions of the merchants and submitted the following three items for maintenance: 1. Please telegraph the two ministries of finance and industry to suspend the implementation of the method of canceling registration and stopping the sale of flowers and issuing licenses, or to allow flexible handling to maintain the industry. 2. Please telegraph the two ministries of finance and industry and the Executive Yuan to instruct the National Match Production and Sales Joint Corporation in Shanghai to convene a national match industry representative conference as soon as possible to jointly discuss the method, properly amend the articles of association, and the agreement signed by the company with foreign merchants in order to establish it as soon as possible. 3. Please telegraph Mayor Shen of Qingdao to jointly find ways to maintain it in order to relieve business difficulties and maintain people's livelihood. Chairman Han and Director Zhang have agreed to handle the three points raised by the representatives and agreed to immediately telegraph the Shanghai Joint General Corporation and Mayor Shen of Qingdao Municipal Government to convene a meeting in Qingdao in the near future to discuss a solution. The representatives believed that the results of the petition were extremely satisfactory, so they returned to Qingdao from Jinan this morning to report everything to the merchants. (January 24)

### Songjiang Intensifies General Re-Investigation of Opium and Drugs

Since the general re-investigation of opium and drug offenders in this county began at the beginning of this month, the county government has sent personnel to reside in the eight districts under its jurisdiction to be responsible for the general re-investigation of each district.

### Aftermath of the Hangzhou Capsized Ferry Tragedy

More than 100 workers from the Kangyi Company, a contractor of the Qiantang River Bridge project, took a small ferry to the middle of the river on the evening of the 23rd at 11:30 pm to change shifts. Because the boat was small and there were too many people, the load was too heavy, and it collided with the iron bucket protecting the bridge piers, causing it to sink and causing an unprecedented tragedy. According to the investigation, the confirmed number of workers on the ferry was 106, and only 27 people were rescued. 79 people were drowned. As of this afternoon, 54 bodies have been recovered. At 10 am, the Hangzhou Land Court sent a prosecutor to lead officials to verify the situation, and the Jianyi Company temporarily placed all the bodies under the thatched shed. On one hand, they purchased clothing and coffins to enshroud them in the evening, and on the other hand, they promised to provide generous condolences. The problem of the good-looking people can be discussed and decided that night.

### The First Game of the Xiqing A Division Championship: Zhou Mu'er Defeats Jingwu

Adopting a Best-of-Three System, the Second Game Will Continue Tonight at 8 PM. The Start Date of the Overall Championship Depends on Tonight's Results.

The Mu'er team, which has the highest hopes for the championship, suffered a tragic defeat to the Zixiong team last week, making the A Division championship of the Xiqing Ordinary League difficult to predict. Now, Mu'er and Jingwu, who share the same score, must again compete in the A Division championship cycle, still adopting a best-of-three system. Last night was the first game. After the clash, both sides were too nervous, resulting in many missed shots. Hua Yulin and Zheng Jichang both committed double fouls, but neither made their free throws. After two minutes of stalemate, Hua Yulin of Mu'er finally scored from the side, opening the record. Jingwu immediately called a timeout. Soon after, Li Ruihua of Jingwu made a basket, tying the score at 2-2. The cheerleaders also cheered wildly. However, Dong Yangfeng, Huang Cunrui, and Hua Yulin of Mu'er then made three consecutive shots, gradually pulling ahead. Jingwu, on the other hand, often wasted opportunities with inaccurate long-range shots. Although they called another timeout, it did not improve the situation. Jingwu ended the first quarter behind with a score of 2 to 8. In the second quarter, Che Liangting of Jingwu first made a long-range shot, while Huang Furui and Hua Yulin of Mu'er each made a free throw. Li Ruihua of Jingwu also made one free throw due to Dong Yangfeng's foul, making the score 5 to 11. However, Zhang Jinxuan was too nervous and missed both free throws, and also missed a good opportunity under the basket. Soon after, Li Ruihua made a long-range shot, finally closing the gap to 7 to 11. Mu'er called a timeout. Sure enough, Hua, Shen Hanjun, and Dong Yangfeng scored three more consecutive baskets, and Mu'er took the lead with 17 to 7 in the first half. After switching sides, Cai Zhixian and Che Liangting of Jingwu each scored twice, and Mu'er called a timeout. Dong, Huang, and Dong scored four times under the basket, quickly recovering the lost ground. Soon after, Li and Cai of Jingwu added three more points, and the third quarter ended with a score of 25 to 14, with Mu'er still holding an absolute advantage. In the final quarter, Hua, Huang, Shen, and others of Mu'er scored continuously, increasing the score to 33 to 14. After Jingwu called a timeout, Cai Zhixian also scored two baskets. Until the last two minutes, Mu'er had secured the victory and replaced Huang Cunrui with Lin Peng. Huang Cunrui scored another basket for Mu'er, leading them to a great victory over Jingwu with a score of 36 to 18. The second game will be held tonight at 8 PM. If Mu'er wins again, they can compete with Yuezhong for the championship without having to hold a third game. Therefore, whether the overall championship game will start the day after tomorrow depends on tonight's results.

### Current Situation of Guangxi University

Lowest Tuition Fees in the Country; No More Than a Hundred Yuan Per Year

Higher education in Guangxi focuses on cultivating specialized talents needed for the province's construction, including Guangxi University, Guangxi Provincial Normal College, and Guangxi Provincial Hospital. Guangxi University is located in Wuzhou and has three colleges: Science, Agriculture, and Engineering. Originally, there were eight departments: Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Agronomy, Forestry, Civil Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. Recently, the provincial government, due to the province's rich mineral resources and the lack of talent to exploit them, ordered the engineering college to set up a mining specialization course in the autumn of the 23rd year. In January of the 24th year, the Ministry of Education ordered the mining specialization course to be expanded into a department. Therefore, in the autumn of the 24th year, the Mining and Metallurgy Department was established. Due to the lack of researchers, enrollment has been temporarily suspended. So, now there are only eight departments and a high school attached. The university has a total of 360 students, and the attached high school has 235 students. The university faculty has 114 people, and the attached high school has 33 people. Since the school focuses on practical science, equipment is naturally the most important. The College of Science was established the earliest, and the general experimental equipment of each department is quite sufficient. Recently, a lot of optical instruments and theoretical chemistry instruments have been purchased. The College of Agriculture also has sufficient instruments, specimens, models, and medicines for horticulture, soil, animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, afforestation, tree measurement, and plant pathology. The College of Engineering has various new machines and surveying machines in the mechanical factory. Recently, a materials laboratory has been added, and it has received a subsidy of 10,000 yuan from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund to purchase mineral processing machines. In terms of the library, the collection includes about 5,000 Chinese and foreign books, 24,000 rare ancient books, 6,800 Chinese and foreign magazines, and 28 kinds of Chinese and foreign magazines. In recent years, the books and magazines needed for reference and research in various colleges and departments have also been greatly supplemented. Military training is very important at Guangxi University and has been implemented for more than four years with good results. In the 23rd year, it was divided into management and training. Since the 24th year, the management team has also increased training. Currently, the four male dormitories are divided into four teams, and the female nurses form one team. Each team has one captain, two deputy captains, and one assistant teacher. The training and management methods are strictly and conscientiously carried out in accordance with the "Guangxi Middle and Above Schools Military Training Regulations." The school's funding is reduced as much as possible. This year's recurrent expenditure is 284,681 yuan, and the temporary expenditure is 111,760 yuan. Before the 22nd year, the annual temporary expenditure and recurrent expenditure accounted for about 50% of the school's total funding. This year, the temporary expenditure only accounts for 24% of the school's total funding. Although the funding is not much, it can well reflect the spirit of hard work and perseverance. The school's fees are very low. Students only pay 15 yuan (equivalent to 12 yuan) per semester for tuition, 40 hao yuan for food, 5 hao yuan for accommodation, 6 hao yuan for miscellaneous fees, 1 hao yuan for sports fees, and 3 hao yuan for experimental fees. The annual cost is no more than 100 yuan, making it the most affordable university in the country. The school has a student work-study program, and poor students can work at the school to subsidize their expenses.

The equipment plans for a high-altitude running platform, a water skating rink, an archery range, twelve piano practice rooms, and horseback riding and boating facilities have been approved by Mayor Wu and are currently being implemented. They will be available for use starting next semester. The existing school buildings utilize the facilities of the sports field. Mayor Wu intends to allocate special funds to build offices, classrooms, and an auditorium. The blueprints have been drawn by architect Dong Dayou and submitted to Mayor Wu for review. Once approved, bids will be solicited from contractors, with construction expected to be completed before July of this year, allowing the college to move into the new campus in time for the autumn semester.

### Public Bonds Set New Record

Short Covering and Adding Positions Occur Simultaneously; Prices Rise Across the Board

Yesterday, the public bond market of the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange witnessed a fierce short squeeze during the final session of the January futures, undiminished by the current situation. Short covering and swaps were particularly active, while major bullish players continued to add large positions. The market price rose steadily, with all recent bond series reaching new highs. Series Wu reached 64.95 yuan, Series Bing reached 65.10 yuan, and Series Yi reached 68.50 yuan, all setting new records since their listing. Today, only the February futures for one month will be traded. Due to the firm confidence, the bond market is quite turbulent and showing an abnormal trend. At the opening yesterday morning, due to short covering by retail investors, No. 45 was actively absorbed, and the trend was consistently firm, rising by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan. In the second session, the market price continued to rise. Series Wu saw a sharp increase of 0.45 yuan in recent contracts due to active short covering. Series Ding and Jia also rose by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan due to crowding buyers. At the afternoon opening, Series Wu's recent contracts suddenly saw a large number of physical goods being sold off, and the market price dropped sharply by 0.40 yuan. However, buying interest in Series Bing and Yi remained strong. Nos. 4, 77, etc., were being acquired, all rising again by 0.05 to 0.30 yuan. The short covering became more intense at the closing, with Nos. 10, 50, and 35 being actively swapped, and Nos. 16 and 71, etc., being heavily bought. Series Wu and Yi rose again by 0.05 to 0.30 yuan, with Series Li even rising by 0.55 yuan. The distant contracts for all bonds were even firmer. The overall result for the day was that Series Wu and Bing rose by 0.20 to 0.60 yuan, while Series Jia and Yi rose by 0.70 to 1.10 yuan. The total trading volume was 15,195,000 yuan. A comparison of the daily fluctuations and highs and lows is listed below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).

### Yarn and Cotton

Coarse Yarn Sales Suddenly Active; Bulls Prepare to Take Delivery

Final Session Raised to 253 Yuan

The yarn market is trending firm. This month is the final act, with both bullish and bearish sides having considerable opposing forces. It is said that 5,000 bales will be delivered, but the bullish side is accepting all of them and may even exceed that number. Therefore, the market first fell and then rose. Currently, yarn merchants from southern Guangdong and Guangxi are particularly active in purchasing, with 10-count coarse yarn being the majority. Traders are purchasing forward contracts to protect their short positions on spot yarn. Inland merchants are particularly eager to collect futures. Therefore, the market was good in the afternoon, and confidence was strong. The final session price for this month was 253 yuan, a decrease of 10 yuan compared to the previous month.

Spot Yarn Prices Rise Again Across All Months

The spot yarn market opened with this month's contracts being the last day. The bullish side held onto February contracts. It is reported that the spot price of 10-count coarse yarn has risen sharply by 1.00 to 2.00 yuan. The bearish side is collecting and transferring delivery chips, tightening the market. Short-term investors are actively covering their positions, and the market is uniquely firm. However, distant contracts are not seeing particularly strong sales in the spot yarn market, and Osaka Sanpin yarn is trending downward. Although the bullish side is strongly pulling up prices, the result is that recent contracts have risen by 1.00 to 1.90 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, while distant contracts have risen or fallen by 0.10 to 0.50 yuan. The market suddenly softened in the afternoon, as about 5,000 bales of 10-count and 20-count yarn were delivered to the warehouse. Sentiment was slightly weak, coupled with the sluggishness of Sanpin yarn. The second session fell again by 0.08 yuan, with distant contracts unchanged. By the third closing, it was reported that merchants from Guangdong, Yunnan, and inland areas were actively purchasing spot yarn, and the bullish side was determined to take delivery, and prices across all months turned upward. As a result, prices across all months rose by 0.15 to 1.00 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Sales were as follows: Hengyi 3,750 bales, Deda 800 bales, Dafeng 800 bales, Taixing 650 bales, Changji 650 bales, Ruida 950 bales, Renfeng 650 bales, Dachangcheng 1,750 bales, Taichang 2,250 bales, Xiecheng 2,100 bales, Yichang 600 bales. Purchases were as follows: Suda 1,650 bales, Mingde 850 bales, Gengfeng 4,950 bales, Xingchang 750 bales, Fengtai 1,550 bales, Shenji 1,100 bales, Runkang 700 bales, Fukang 2,250 bales, Xincheng 1,850 bales, Yongda 650 bales. The daily high and low prices are listed below.

Spot Yarn Sales Suddenly Improve

Yesterday, merchants purchased a total of 4,455 bales of spot and future yarn, with sales prices rising by 1.00 to 2.00 yuan. The purchase amounts by each merchant are listed below.

Settlement and Cotton/Yarn Markets Also Closed

The Shanghai Chinese Merchant Yarn and Cloth Exchange will suspend market gatherings starting on February 6th. All brokers will make payments to and receive payments from the exchange. All payments starting from the 1st will be made with bank or money shop drafts with a maturity of six days, which will be the end of the day. The market will resume as usual after the opening on February 15th.

### Ample Delivery Chips; Cotton Falls Sharply by 0.45 Yuan This Month

The cotton market was quiet and weak, as cotton stocks have not decreased and there are ample delivery chips, disappointing the bullish side. At the same time, the world cotton industry is bleak and weak, and confidence is increasingly sluggish. The final session price for this month was 42.10 yuan, a decrease of 0.08 yuan compared to the previous month. The future of the cotton market remains in a state of hesitation.

Spot Cotton Distant Months Still Flat

The spot cotton market opened with ample deliveries for this month, coupled with the overseas cotton market trending steadily downward, and the Osaka Sanpin cotton falling even more sharply, further dampening confidence. However, trading in the market was particularly sluggish. As a result, prices across all months fell by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market fell again by 0.15 yuan in the afternoon due to active deliveries and weak bullish sentiment, while distant months remained flat. There were no changes after the first session. As a result, prices for this month fell by 0.25 yuan compared to the morning closing price, while distant months remained unchanged. Sales were as follows: Dafeng 1,100 dan, Juxing 1,100 dan, Tongji 1,100 dan, Yutai 5,300 dan, Hexing 2,800 dan, Senkang 2,100 dan, Changfeng 4,700 dan, Runkang 3,200 dan, Tonghe 1,100 dan, Xincheng 4,000 dan, Xiecheng 1,100 dan, Fukang 1,500 dan. Purchases were as follows: Jifeng 2,600 dan, Dafu 3,600 dan, Shenji 3,800 dan, Yikang 1,500 dan, Gengfeng 5,000 dan, Hengde 1,000 dan, Changji 1,200 dan, Xinchang 1,000 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,500 dan. The daily high and low prices are listed below.

Spot Cotton Consumption Active

The current cotton mills have gradually improved, with 2,042 bales of Yao cotton and 1,258 bales of Tong cotton received.

Sanpin Yarn and Cotton Fall Uniformly

According to a telegram from Osaka on the 25th, spot yarn fell by 1.00 to 3.00 yuan. 16-count Fanmian was 250 yuan, down 1.00 yuan. 20-count Jinyu was 269 yuan, down 1.00 yuan. 40-count Wuxing was 410 yuan, unchanged. 42-count Zhizi was 395 yuan, down 3.00 yuan. Sanpin futures yarn fell by 2.00 to 4.60 yuan, with recent contracts at 258.90 yuan and distant contracts at 252 yuan. Futures cotton fell by 0.06 to 1.30 yuan, with recent contracts at 75.10 yuan and distant contracts at 77 yuan.

US Cotton Fluctuated Narrowly Last Week

According to a telegram from New York, cotton prices fluctuated narrowly last week. New speculative interest was limited, as the general public was awaiting the publication of detailed information on the sale of pledged cotton. The tendency of manufacturers to sell and settle purchase prices was the main trend of the week. However, most bullish investors, seeing the weakness of various markets, settled their positions, disappointing many. Strikes and favorable European news had stirred up selling sentiment, and restrictions on exchange rates in Japan also caused unease. However, the cotton market strongly resisted the pressure, so the market was generally believed to be stable. Currently, there is a surge in the dumping of low-grade goods, as merchants expect competition to be more intense when pledged cotton is sold, and the market price has loosened. However, inquiries from manufacturers have improved, and very few high-grade cottons are available for immediate shipment.

According to the New York Cotton Exchange's weekly statistics, arrivals totaled 10,307,000 bales, an increase of 190,000 bales from last week and an increase of 270,000 bales from the same period last year.

Shipments to factories totaled 4,755,000 bales, an increase of 188,000 bales from last week and an increase of 297,000 bales from the same period last year. US cotton exports since August 1st totaled 3,414,000 bales, an increase of 104,000 bales from last week and a decrease of 620,000 bales from the same period last year. Shipments to Japan totaled 889,000 bales, China 19,000 bales, the United Kingdom 732,000 bales, and Germany 447,000 bales. There is currently no inventory in New York. New York's inventory last week was 1,000 bales, and the same period last year was 55,000 bales. US inventories totaled 4,689,000 bales, lower than last week's 97,000 bales and lower than the same period last year's 211,000 bales.

World visible supply totaled 8,460,000 bales, a decrease of 16,000 bales from last week and an increase of 163,000 bales from the same period last year. US cotton accounted for 6,214,000 bales of the total.

Since August 1st, US cotton shipments to world yarn factories totaled 7,345,000 bales, an increase of 318,000 bales from last week and an increase of 892,000 bales from the same period last year (unit: thousands of bales).

Indian Cotton Fluctuated with Sanpin Last Week

At the beginning of the week, Sanpin fell sharply, causing bullish investors here to settle their positions and futures traders to sell off. Afterwards, Sanpin rebounded, and sellers dared not resist further, engaging in short covering. A large amount of cotton, originally intended for shipment to Japan, has been temporarily suspended due to Japan's control of foreign exchange. Spot cotton is relatively quiet, Lancashire is mediocre, and inquiries from various places are scarce. The weekly statistics are appended below (unit: thousands of bales).

### Piece Goods

### Stockpiling of Cotton Cloth Revives

400-500 Bales of Spot Fine Cloth Collected

The cloth market was slightly firmer yesterday. Although overseas cotton markets were uniformly declining, the recent markets for spot yarn and cotton turned firmer, and the stockpiling sentiment of cotton cloth hoarders revived. Local and inland merchants absorbed 400 to 500 bales of spot fine cloth, coarse cloth, and fine twill cloth. Forward trading was also active. Dongmian and Ito firms opened offers for over 400 bales of fine cloth from Dongpi, Rihua Factory's Jixiang brand, Shanghai Factory's Lanri brand, and Qingdao goods' Santao brand for February, March, and April futures. Market prices for forward contracts were all firm by 0.025 to 0.05 yuan per piece. The supply of Toyota Factory's Dancing City Cloth and 84 Cloth was particularly scarce, and sales prices rose sharply by 0.10 yuan per piece. Merchants from the southwest, Sichuan, Guangxi, and Guangdong were uninterested in buying. Merchants from Hunan were slightly buying white goods, fine cloth, fine twill cloth, and colored cloth. Inquiries from Jiangxi, Hubei, and Anhui were also quiet. However, merchants from Tianjin in the north were slightly buying coarse cloth, and merchants from Shandong also saw a decline in buying interest. The colored cloth market was sluggish. Luen Chang's Hao Xia blue cloth was reduced by 0.20 yuan per piece, and colored twill cloth also fell by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan per piece. The markets for broadcloth, Zhigong, serge, and printed cloth were flat. Sales prices for our factory's fine cloth and fine twill cloth also stabilized.

Western Zhigong Sells Well in Tianjin

Imports Have Been Greatly Reduced in Recent Years; Recently, Sales Have Suddenly Increased, Clearing Out Inventories

Western yuanqing Zhigong wool fabric, since the introduction of eastern and domestic products and Zhigong magua jackets, has seen a great reduction in imports. Old brands such as Rongtai, Anli, Deji, Lulin, and Gongyi have struggled. Foreign firms have either switched to Dongyang Zhuangkou or closed down one after another. According to investigations by customs, imports of Western yuanqing Zhigong wool fabric have decreased by two-thirds compared to three to five years ago. Unexpectedly, things have reached an extreme and rebounded. Last year's abundant harvest in rural areas and the revival of commerce have greatly increased sales of wool fabrics. The demand for Zhigong has suddenly increased, and old inventories of Western yuanqing Zhigong are being sold out one after another. Most have been bought up by Tianjin merchants. It is reported that Western Zhigong sales are quite strong in Tianjin. Recently, Tianjin merchants with ample funds have been sending letters and telegrams to Shanghai to continue purchasing. However, Shanghai's inventories are also depleted, so the market atmosphere has recovered.

### Sugar Market

Hainan Red Slices and Qing Slightly Decline

The sugar market trended weak yesterday. The association's negotiated price for Grade 24 coarse white spot goods was 23.20 yuan, but no transactions occurred. Transit goods were traded at 7.60 to 7.55 yuan, down 0.01 to 0.05 yuan. Eastern white spot goods also fell slightly by 0.01 yuan, with Grade 4 J Mark at 23.25 yuan and Grade 8 and 9 SH Marks both at 22.85 yuan. Transit goods were unchanged. The local factory's Mianbai Zhenji Grade 1 was 22.20 yuan, with the remainder following the decline. Merchants from Guangdong and Chaozhou offered over a hundred bags of spot Hainan red, with slices at 14 yuan, down 0.01 to 0.02 yuan. Dozens of bags of spot Beihai green slices were negotiated by the association at 11.40 yuan, down 0.02 yuan. Those who could deliver next week offered 11.20 yuan, with over 200 bags traded. The combined company's Shantou coarse white was offered at 22.80 yuan, and medium sandy white was offered at 20 yuan, but no transactions occurred. (Due to limited space, the sugar market reports for the past few days have not been published.)

The Sugar Industry Passed a Steady Year

Foreign Sugar Greatly Affected by Smuggling; Domestic Sugars Enjoyed Smooth Sailing

The sugar industry in 1925 was repeatedly plagued by rumors of tariff reductions on foreign sugar in May and June. As a result, market prices for Dutch coarse white, Dutch red, Eastern white, and Eastern red were sometimes weak, with very few opportunities for profit. For example, Dutch coarse white once rose to over 22.70 yuan in January, but afterwards, it was in a constant state of decline and fluctuation, reaching a low of 21.50 yuan. The largest difference for the year was 1.20 yuan. The market trend for Eastern white was similar. Taking Grade 8 white as an example, the highest price in January was 22.30 yuan. From February to September, the market was in a decline, with the lowest price at 21.10 yuan. There was a slight rebound in October, November, and December, with the highest price only reaching 21.40 yuan. The highest price for Grade 8 and 9 Dutch red was 17 yuan, and the lowest price was 15.60 yuan. Eastern red was similar, with a difference of 1.20 to 1.30 yuan. The foreign sugar market was completely overshadowed by rumors of white sugar smuggling and tariff reductions in North China, and remained weak and difficult to recover. Fortunately, the tariff reduction on foreign sugar was never implemented, and although market prices were weak, the decline was still small. Otherwise, there would have been an even greater decline.

As mentioned above regarding foreign sugar, it can be seen that it was not accidental that those engaged in this industry found it difficult to profit. The biggest reason for this was smuggling of Japanese sugar. The rumors of tariff reductions also originated from this. However, the overall market price fluctuations were not large. Even if there were losses, the amount was very small. Moreover, domestic Chaozhou sugar had excellent opportunities. For example, green sugar, taking Huanggang goods as an example, once reached a low of 10 yuan in January. The market rose in February, March, and April, reaching a high of 11 yuan. In May, it fell back to 9.80 yuan for a time, but it gradually rose in June, July, August, September, and October, with the highest price reaching 14.50 yuan, an increase of nearly one-third. The profits that could be made during this period can be imagined. However, different firms had different practices. Those who bought more and sold less made more profits, followed by those who bought and sold at the same time. Therefore, those who focused on domestic sugar last year could be assured of profits. Firms such as Junyisheng Kee, etc., devoted themselves to this, and their results were certainly good. Other firms with strong financial resources, such as Yuansheng, Yufengheng, and Fangcuihe, etc., could also profit. The market trends for Diaoqing, Pianqing, Mianchi, and Hainan Red were largely the same. The lowest price for Diaoqing was 9.30 yuan, and the highest price reached 13.50 yuan, with a difference of 4.20 yuan. The lowest price for Pianqing was 7.80 yuan, and the highest price reached 10.70 yuan, with a difference of 2.90 yuan. The lowest price for Mianchi was 12 to 13 yuan, and the highest price reached about 16 yuan, with a difference of about 4 yuan. The lowest price for Hainan Red was 10.90 yuan, and the highest price reached 14.40 yuan, with a difference of 3.50 yuan. The price fluctuations were all around 3 to 4 yuan, and the market trend was mostly rising more than falling. Those engaged in this industry were in an advantageous position, and profits were inevitable. Other specialty goods, such as miscellaneous white Jianbing, etc., were also no less profitable. There was also a large portion of domestic Wuyang coarse white, with the highest price at 22.70 yuan and the lowest at 21.30 yuan, with a difference of 1.40 yuan. The local factory's Mianbai, such as Zhenji Grade 1, had a highest price of 21.60 yuan and a lowest price of 20.30 yuan, with a difference of 1.30 yuan, all on a steady trend. The Wuyang coarse white was mostly bought and sold at the same time, with very little risk. Overall, although foreign sugar was not easy to profit from, it did not cause much loss. Coupled with the excellent opportunities for domestic sugar, the sugar industry in the past year, if not for smuggling, would certainly have had special achievements in this time of abundant agricultural production. However, smuggling in North China ultimately led to a weak market trend, and the results for foreign sugar were diminished. However, what was lost in the east was gained in the west. Domestic green and red sugar had smooth sailing and made great profits. Furthermore, very few accounts went bad last year, which further indicates the stability of the sugar industry. It is predicted that most will certainly profit at the end of the year. Even those with slightly less successful results need not worry about suffering losses. It is said that during the Shaanxi Incident, those with larger accounts in this area were quite concerned, but recently, the sugar market has seen a resurgence in foreign sugar prices due to the rising prices of Dutch sugar. Domestic Chaozhou sugar has also seen rising prices due to the lack of inventory and active winter sales, leading to a rise in all types of sugar, with a prosperous and rosy outlook. The market prices at the end of last year and recently are listed below for reference (unit: yuan).

### Dried and Preserved Goods

Hunan Merchants Actively Buying Large Quantities of Jinshan Branches

Due to the revived sales of Jinshan flat branches produced in Guangdong in Hunan, over a thousand pieces have been purchased in recent days. As a result, listed prices have suddenly become tight, rising by 2 to 3 yuan compared to before, and many are still unwilling to open offers immediately, intending to sell at good prices in the spring market. At the same time, market prices have also risen accordingly. Higher-quality goods must be sold for 37 to 38 yuan, with slightly reduced prices for the next tier. Continued tightness in the market seems likely.

### Finance

### Spot Gold Rises and Then Relapses

The Bullish Side Continues to Lower Prices by 0.20 Yuan

The gold market initially saw overseas silver markets declining slightly or remaining unchanged, with varying exchange rate fluctuations. London spot gold rose by half a penny. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with both the British and American rates flat and customs gold unchanged. The standard gold price rose to 1154 yuan. The morning opening was slightly higher, initially rising after the opening but then falling as large players had varying demands for supply. However, spot traders had stronger buying interest, and prices rose again briefly. The bullish side then proceeded to unload, and the market became unstable. The swap discount has now fallen to 1 yuan. Here is a summary of the day's market conditions:

The morning opening was 1152.70 yuan, slightly higher by 0.10 yuan compared to last Saturday. Shengyuan Yongjin rose to 2.90 yuan. Yuanmao, Yongda, Decheng, Hengyu, and Dafengheng were selling off, retreating to 2.60 yuan. Qingfa and Yongdai Shengyuan Yongli bought, and the price rose to 3 yuan. Yuanmao and Yonghengyu continued to offer supply. The noon close was 1152.80 yuan.

The afternoon market opened at 1152.70 yuan. Dadecheng, Yuanmao, and Yonghengyu all sold. The closing price retreated to 1152.40 yuan. The price only fluctuated by 0.60 yuan throughout the day, and the market continued to fall by 0.20 yuan.

The settlement price rose to 1154 yuan due to the Central Bank's standard gold price listing, which was about 2 yuan lower than the closing price. The spot market was calm. Tongfenghang once purchased 140 taels of this brand of refined gold at 13 yuan above the listed price. This was sold by silver shops. Tianjin goods were sold at 12 yuan above the listed price. The selling price of refined gold was 14 yuan, and the buying price was 10 yuan. There was a market without transactions. The swap discount fell to 1 yuan due to the urgent need of the bearish side to settle in. Taichangxiang sold 126 bars, Yuanmao Yong sold 84 bars, and Qiaofen Yong sold 28 bars.

Trading in the market was scarce. Overall, Tongtaichang and Shengyuan Yong Qingfa Yong were on the buying side, while Yuanmao Yong, Hengyu Dafengheng, and Dadecheng were on the selling side. In addition to public contracts, there were only 41 bars left for this month. There was a total of one bullish player and one bearish player. There were 2,191 bars left for February, with a total of 6 bullish players and 15 bearish players. There were 5,173 bars of chips for March, with a total of 23 bullish players and 20 bearish players. The total number of transactions was 420 bars in the morning and 119 bars in the afternoon.

Today, Tongfengyu of the bearish side cleared 1,386 bars in public contracts, Tongfengheng cleared 539 bars, and Dingkang cleared 35 bars. The bullish side should receive a total of 1,960 bars, including 868 bars for Futaiheng, 392 bars for Chunyuan Yong, 252 bars for Qiaofen Yong, 238 bars for Qingfa Yong, and 210 bars for Shengyuan Yong, at a settlement price of 1149 yuan.

Foreign Exchange Settlement Slightly More Active

The foreign exchange market trended slightly lower due to slightly higher exports and tighter banking funds in Japan. The morning initially saw overseas telegrams reporting that London telegraphic transfers, both near and far, had narrowed by 0.0625. The New York silver market was closed, and the distant forward silver price in Monterry saw no changes. London spot gold rose by half a penny. The British rate against the US rate narrowed by 0.0625. The US rate against the French rate rose by 3 points. The British rate against the Japanese rate narrowed by 0.03125. The US rate against the British rate rose by 0.0625. The US rates against the French and Japanese rates were flat. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with both the American and British rates flat and customs gold unchanged. At the morning opening, the British and American rates were flat. After the opening, customers continued to sell Harbin yuan, while Japanese banks remained flat. HSBC listed the British and American rates as flat. The white silver balance tax was slightly above 0.025. The market hovered in the middle. Later, due to interbank trading and swaps, coupled with the fact that Japanese banks were still absorbing eastern remittances, the situation was slightly balanced. The afternoon was also the same. Later, banks traded more among themselves and the market was flat. The Dalian merchants continued to pledge remittances related to Japanese remittances, but they were absorbed by Japanese banks. As a result, compared to last Saturday, the near and far rates for both the British and American currencies were flat. Chinese merchants sold about 200,000 yuan of distant Japanese remittances, while Dalian merchants sold about 300,000 yuan of spot miscellaneous remittances related to Japanese remittances. Here is a record of the day's transactions:

The morning opening for the British remittance was a selling price of 1 shilling 2.59375 pence for the near term. HSBC sold January contracts to foreign firms at 59375. Later, Oriental Bank sold January contracts at 59375. The closing selling price was 1 shilling 2.59375 pence for spot and January contracts, 53125 for February contracts, and 5625 for February contracts. The buying price was 0.03125. The volume traded was about 30,000 pounds.

The morning opening for the American remittance was a buying price of 29.8125 yuan. Macgary bought January contracts at 875. Citibank sold February contracts at 75 to Zhengjin.

Sluggish Actual Sales, Near Weakness and Distant Strength in Flour and Wheat

Flour: Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for all months initially fell and then rose, eventually showing a pattern of near-term weakness and long-term strength. The price of foreign wheat was reported as Chicago up one-eighth of a cent, Canada up four cents, and Liverpool down one penny. Therefore, at the opening, the prices of foreign wheat fluctuated. Market sentiment was generally unstable, so although the initial prices for all months were down one cent from the previous week, factories observed and waited. Outside clients gradually absorbed supplies, so sentiment became mixed, and buying interest was relatively strong. As a result, prices for all months rose by two, three, or four cents. By the afternoon opening, the current month had only one and a half days left until delivery, and most hedgers were directly taking delivery from factories. However, inland factories had 40,000 to 50,000 bags prepared for delivery, so bulls had even less room to maneuver, and the price fell to as low as eight dollars and one cent. However, long-term sentiment remained firm. Given this situation, the market was entirely driven by hedging. The difference between the current month and January had reached seven and a half cents, and the difference between February and March had reached six cents. Therefore, if actual sales do not improve, near-term prices will likely be hit first.

Wheat: Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market in the morning, prices for all months showed a pattern of near-term stability and long-term gains. The price of foreign wheat fluctuated. The current month was nearing delivery, and factories were unwilling to take delivery due to sluggish flour sales, so the opening price once fell to six dollars and five cents. However, prices quickly rebounded. For long-term months, many short positions were closed due to settlement, resulting in stronger buying interest, and prices rose by three, six, or seven cents. By the afternoon opening, the settlement of the current month was already complete, with little change. Prices rose by one cent. Trading in February and subsequent months became quiet, and the market showed consolidation, with slight fluctuations of one or two cents compared to the morning. With the final settlement date approaching by one day, if there are no major changes abroad, the market can pass through this period calmly. Currently, the wheat market is sluggish for near-term standards, and asking prices are also loose. Wheat from Jiangbei is quoted at six dollars, one dime, two cents, and three cents. However, some shipments from the Jinpu Railway area, with very good quality, are only quoted at six dollars, two dimes, and five cents, with only two to three thousand bags seen.

Jing Rice Hoarders Show Slight Movement

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, due to continuous rain, only over twenty sources of supply arrived, totaling about four thousand piculs. Thin rice accounted for thirteen or fourteen sources, while Qingdao dealers continued to sell two thousand-odd packages of rice. Therefore, market conditions were slightly tight, and prices rose by five cents. Thick japonica rice, due to normal sales in this area, showed no significant fluctuations. Du Yang sharp rice also lacked any changes. Yin Bian Yuan had limited sales channels and may fall slightly further.

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about thirty boats arrived from various routes downriver. Sales in various markets were flat. However, white japonica rice hoarders showed slight movement, and prices in the early market rose slightly. Limited transactions in the afternoon market slightly improved, causing prices to stabilize. Early rice was flat and weak, thin rice down a few cents, and Bai Yuan also showed weakness. Prices for other goods were flat with a hint of stability.

Ke Xian Rice Relies Solely on Guangdong Sales

Yesterday, Ke Xian rice sales to Guangdong were very strong, with 20,000 bags of rough machine rice being shipped through various routes. Therefore, even before the end of the year, various cargo owners rushed to pay taxes, but market prices remained stable. However, demand in this area was sluggish, and yesterday's market only saw slight improvements. Shantou dealers also made minor accommodations. Therefore, although sales to Guangdong were strong, market prices were difficult to raise further, and the intention of large-scale hoarding was also stagnant. Prices for all rice remained flat and stable. The total amount of Jiangxi rice sold yesterday was 10,100 bags, Xiang rice 6,112 bags, Wen Xian 3,500 bags, Han rough rice 4,500 bags, Jiaxing rough sharp rice 200 bags, and factory broken rice 39 bags. Rough rice accounted for more than half of the total.

The Miscellaneous Grains Market is Already Concluding

Payments are Settled During the Kitchen God Festival

The market conditions for various miscellaneous grains are already concluding, so there are no significant changes. The payments for goods bought and sold in the market are settled during the Kitchen God Festival, according to custom. Therefore, regardless of the date of the transaction, all payments must be made in cash on February 4. As a result, trading has been slow recently. Yesterday, only this area and the Tongzhou dealers in inland areas inquired about yellow soybeans, with sales of over 1,800 bags of open-mouth Zha soybeans, 800 bags of Hankou late soybeans, 214 bags of Dingjiazhou soybeans, 100 bags of Pinghu Du soybeans, 100 bags of Jiujiang late soybeans, and over 230 bags of Jiujiang winter soybeans.

### Metals

Hui Si Iron Exceeds 40 Yuan

Recently, the fixed price of Hui Si iron has soared, so prices in this area have also increased accordingly. Furthermore, the current stock of Qi iron is limited, so the general market price has exceeded the 40 yuan mark. Yesterday, over 300 boxes were sold, with each box priced at 40 yuan and five cents. It is said that canning factories and cigarette companies are actively collecting supplies.

New Arrivals of Thick Iron

Recently, the market for thick iron has been extremely scarce, leaving buyers with little hope of finding goods. Yesterday, New Taikoo Wharf received 600 boxes of new stock, which were ordered by a certain iron merchant on North Suzhou Road. It is said that 400 boxes have already been taken away, purchased by the Ordnance Factory, with a price of 75 yuan. The retail price is 85 yuan.

### Silk and Tea

Few Silk Transactions by American and French Merchants

Yesterday, in the overseas silk market, the current and forward prices in Yokohama fell slightly by two yuan. New York was closed due to the weekend. In Shanghai, there were slight sales. White factory silk grade 78 sold for 825 yuan, raw silk grade 78 sold for 780 yuan, and grade B without uniformity sold for 760 yuan, down 40 yuan from the peak price last month. Yesterday, foreign firms made a few transactions with American and French merchants. Domestic textile factories had little interest in purchasing due to the upcoming Lunar New Year. Market prices also fell slightly by about 20 yuan compared to the previous period. A total of 87 bales were sold.

Spring and Autumn

### Praisers of War

Being busy with military preparations is war itself; the battles fought on the battlefield are merely a public display of the skills acquired during peacetime. (James)

Although the country is secure, it is perilous to forget war. (Sima Fa)

War is a major element in maintaining world order. Human morality is only elucidated through war. Without war, the world would degenerate and be submerged into who knows what abyss. (Moltke)

Treat wartime as peacetime work, and peacetime as wartime work. (Napoleon)

If war ceases, humanity will perish. Therefore, only war is good. (Bakunin)

War is the scale that God uses to weigh nations, the touchstone to test nations, the winnowing fan that eliminates the weak and retains the strong, and the only means by which people can collectively dedicate all their strength with a single purpose. If there are good leaders, victory is possible; if there are weaknesses, failure is inevitable. (Steinmetz)

War is the father of all things. (Heraclitus) (Lu Dan)

### Traces of Wang Baochuan

— Wang Yongtao

The play "Wang Baochuan," after being adapted and directed by Mr. Xiong Shiyi, caused a sensation in Europe and America, who regarded Wang Baochuan as the eternal and immortal chaste woman of China, which is indeed a glory for women in our country. Now, I will briefly record the traces of Wang Baochuan, which I believe the readers will be happy to hear.

In the northern countryside of Fengxiang, Shaanxi, there is an old tomb in the vicinity of wasteland. Although it was magnificently built at the time, it has been more than a thousand years since then, so it has been damaged beyond repair. The weeds and wild flowers grow luxuriantly on the barren soil, covering the entire tomb. Tall trees surround it, and the inscriptions on the stone tablet are blurred and unclear. However, upon closer inspection, one can vaguely see the words "Tomb of Wang Baochuan, Chaste Woman of the Tang Dynasty," which is obviously her burial place. Because the location is remote, with open fields and few people, only during the peach and plum blossoming spring season do groups of traveling men and women come to visit, admiring the relics. Moreover, women, deeply impressed by her struggles as a poor and chaste woman, are willing to kneel and pay their respects to express their sympathy.

Wang Baochuan's suffering cave dwelling is located in front of Wujiapo on the bank of the Honggou ditch in Qujiang Pond, south of Chang'an City, Shaanxi. After her death, a memorial hall was built in the open space to the left of the cave, but it was also dilapidated due to years of neglect. Therefore, a grand new memorial hall was rebuilt last spring, and construction was completed in early November last year, magnificent and brand new. Inside the hall are clay statues of her and her husband, Xue Pinggui. The unveiling ceremony was held on the 21st of the same month, and people from far and near flocked to see them, breaking the silence of the once deserted scene.

### Postman

— Wei Jing

For twenty years, the relationship between the postman and me has been extremely close, so my fondness for the postman is truly indescribable. My fondness for the letter-delivering postman began in my student days. At that time, I was studying in Nanjing. The school was far from the city, so there were only two mail deliveries per day. At that time, I was a young child who had just left home, so I naturally missed my family often. Therefore, whenever the postman brought me a letter from home, I would always extend my affection to the green-clad messenger and feel an indescribable gratitude. Even more so, during the first few days of each month, the green-clad messenger would often bring me registered letters with money orders from my father and older brother.

After leaving school, I was confined to my hometown. My hometown is a small village in Jiangnan with fewer than one hundred households, so my only companion for dispelling boredom was the far-reaching postman, who brought me the Shen Bao newspaper and letters from friends every day. The last time was when the old postman delivered me a notification letter from a family friend who had successfully introduced me to a job. As a result, I left my hometown and joined the ranks of Shanghai. However, my relationship with the postman did not diminish from that time onward; on the contrary, it became even closer because, from that time, I developed a friendship with a girl. Over three or four years, friendship turned into love. During this process, we went from one letter every half month to one letter every ten days, one letter every week, and finally one letter every three days. By the time we were about to get married, we were writing one letter a day, sometimes even two letters a day. Therefore, I believe that the green-clad messenger was not only my job introducer but also, in an invisible way, no less than my marriage matchmaker.

My relationship with the postman did not end with marriage. Even now, I still rely on the postman's tireless efforts to maintain all my connections with my family in my hometown and the friendships with relatives and friends scattered in all directions. Since last year, I have transferred to the mail order department of a service organization, so my relationship with the postman has become even deeper because, if the postman does not come to my door one day, I will have absolutely nothing to do.

Society is progressing day by day. Human affairs are becoming more complex day by day. Although transportation tools such as trains, automobiles, ships, airplanes, telegraphs, and telephones are so advanced that they are sufficient to cope with complex human affairs and promote society, in terms of "stability, speed, and affordability," the postman's service should still be considered second to none. Based on my life experiences, I feel that the favors I have received in my life, given to me by the green-clad messenger, are among the things I will never forget in my life.

### A Trip to Sheshan

— Yinghua

Ever since Mr. Zhang from Songjiang told us about the magnificence of the Sheshan Church, I have always wanted to go there. Last Saturday, the sun was warm and the weather was particularly clear, so everyone agreed to take a trip to Sheshan.

After arriving in Songjiang, we rented a car and arrived in half an hour. The car stopped in a broad square with scattered tiles and bricks, surrounded by vast fields.

Rather than calling it climbing a mountain, it is more like crossing a high bridge. From the mountain gate upwards, there is a wide and flat slope. The trees on both sides of the mountain are quite far apart, creating a solemn and tranquil atmosphere. At the top of this slope is a police station, followed by stone steps. After walking a few dozen steps, the flat and bright old church is in front of us. Down to the left of a stone platform, many Chinese men and women are kneeling respectfully in prayer. Three shrines, with Jesus and his parents standing solemnly, allow people to admire their majestic appearance and lament their benevolence. At the feet of the Virgin Mary, a young Chinese woman is weeping, having lost her husband and seeking the Virgin Mary's forgiveness for her sins. Here, our Bodhisattvas have already lost their divine powers and the love of their people!

Going further up, facing us is the statue of Jesus' crucifixion, followed by stone carvings depicting the prelude to Jesus' crucifixion. Then, the mountain path winds upwards, with a small pavilion at the beginning and end of each section, each inscribed with the various stages of the crucifixion, with a verse from the Bible quoted above. After walking through all fourteen pavilions, we reached the end, and a great and simple building appeared before us. This is the church that was built from 1927 onwards, and it is the achievement and foundation that the French painstakingly created and planted on our land over nine years, hoping to use these white stones to buy the hearts of the Chinese people.

Because it was not a time for worship, the door was closed. We managed to negotiate with the gatekeeper through a small door on the side before we could enter. The atmosphere inside was indeed too serene. In the center was a dazzling golden shrine, and Jesus, dripping with blood on the cross, was nailed high up. The scene would truly bring tears to the eyes of believers. The construction inside was extremely solid. The pillars were all pieced together from large stones, smooth and strong. It is said that the workers who built this church were all trained, and they were required to hammer one stone each day, not too fast and not too slow, so the project was particularly accurate. After we rested for a while on the pews where people sit to worship, we quietly walked out, marveling at the power of others. The broken walls and ruins outside the church reflected in the setting sun, retaining the grandeur of the Daxiong Hall from more than a decade ago!

It was already one o'clock in the afternoon when we came down the mountain. We ate the zongzi we had brought at a small teahouse opposite the station and then took the three o'clock public bus back to Songjiang City with a large group of tourists!

### The Women's Country of Xinyang Port

— Chen Xiaokan

—An Interesting Page of Local Customs—

—A Scandalous Little News Story—

Although Yancheng is a city bordering the Yellow Sea, it is still more than two hundred and ten li away from the sea. To the south is the Doulong Port; to the north is the Xinyang Port. Both of these ports are vast. At the same time, they have a very important relationship with the Chinese fishing industry. During the time when fishing boats return in September and October, the dozens of li of vast sea surface are completely occupied by fishing boats, leaving no space at all. —In the location of the Xinyang Port, there is a small village town, which the locals call Huachuan Port, which is also the women's country that the author wants to write about.

How did this Huachuan Port come to be called "Women's Country"? The reason is that transportation from Yancheng to the beach is too inconvenient. There are only a few uneven dirt roads with thorns up to the knees. Paved roads are simply non-existent. At the same time, rickshaws; motorcycles;... it can be said that even a shadow is rarely seen. Only wheelbarrows (small cars) can be used for transportation. The speed of wheelbarrows is very slow. In fact, it is impossible to push them for more than two hundred and ten li in one day. In this sparsely populated wilderness, if one is caught overnight, wouldn't there be a great danger? Therefore, generations of fishermen with wives and children felt the hardship and inconvenience of traveling back and forth, and many moved to Huachuan Port, which is close to the sea, to build houses and live there. At first, there were only thirty or forty households, but in recent years, it has increased to more than two thousand households. Moreover, during the fishing season in March, men over the age of ten in each family have to board ships and sail south to fish in places like Liuhe; Hupu; and Wusong, and they will only return fully loaded at the end of September or early October in the lunar calendar. —During this long half-year, only women guard the doors in the town of Huachuan Port, so it has become a strange women's country!

In this small town, because the residents have a spirit of unity and strong physique, although no public security organs have been established, the place is very quiet, and pirates dare not easily harass them. Moreover, everyone is willing to endure hardship and work hard to fight for their livelihood, so every household has warm clothes and full stomachs, with no worries, and simply does not know that there are any hardships in the world!

Although there is no complete shop here, the embroidery rooms of a group of women are decorated very luxuriously, with everything from toothpaste; perfume; snow cream;... all available. It turns out that these famous cosmetics are all bought back by their husbands when they sail south.

The women on Huachuan Port are all beautiful and charming. During these six months, only women guard the homes in the town. Therefore, a group of proletarian bachelors in Yancheng dare to go to Huachuan Port, and that little bit of casual flirtation scatters to the east and west only when their husbands are about to return by boat.

### Change of Nest Luan Phoenix

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Episode 10 (Silk Handkerchief Conveys Tender Feelings, Strange Words Cast Mistakes; Yellow Flowers Face Withered Autumn Letter Adds Sorrow)

That day, after careful calculation, on the afternoon of the next day, he selected a book and revised the letter to Menglan again. As before, he had Liu Ma take it to the Li family. After two days, Menglan responded to the letter, and Youmei had already delivered the letter, so there was no doubt. However, since that misunderstanding, Youmei had not come at all, but she continued to deliver letters for the two of them. Time flies, and the summer vacation of several dozen days passed in a blur. Guoqi still went to school to teach, and Menglan still went to school to study. The alley they used to pass through often has now returned to meeting again. Guoqi was already thinking three days before returning to normal that he had not seen Menglan for more than two months, and he did not know if Menglan was thinner or fatter. Or still unchanged. Moreover, with these few months of friendship, each other's feelings will be more progressive, and there will be a chance to meet again, and they will definitely get along well, and they can always have a few words. Thinking like this, he only hoped that day would come so that he could admire this progressive achievement. And after finally enduring until this day, he calculated the time and set off on this road. Under this situation, it can also be said that they are telepathic. When he walked into this end of the alley, Menglan also walked into that end of the alley. Guoqi had prepared a few days ago that when he met Menglan this time, he did not need to panic. First, he fixed his feet, then took off his hat, and finally bowed. Then he smiled and said: Miss Jiang is still studying in the original school in the second half of this year! After he responds, he probably won't mention the matter of communicating with each other, but he will definitely praise his own literature. At that time, he would smile and agree with him that there was nothing to take, although a lot of writing was published, it was only a kind of hard work. The following words cannot be predicted, only to reply to the camera at that time. But preparing these words, the ceremony of the first meeting is complete. He felt very calm in his heart and walked forward along the alley. By the time the two could see each other, Guoqi's heart was pounding wildly, and a blush flew up on his face, turning red to the back of his ears. The more he walked forward, the lower his head became. Lowering his head, he could only see two or three feet of the road in front of him. Until the two were only three or four feet apart, his own timid thoughts were finally overcome by his own love, so he stopped and glanced at the person opposite him. Menglan walked slowly from a distance. When they were almost close enough for their clothes to touch, he suddenly stopped and stared at Guoqi with his bright eyes. (127)

Personal Vignettes

### Past Events Unrelated to "Diplomatic Secrets" (Part 1)

— Zhang Zhenxiang

When the enemy intensifies their efforts against us, in addition to the military secrets that must not be leaked, the internal movements of the diplomatic front, anyone with a sense of nation, a slightly ethnic consciousness, also knows that there are many things that cannot be easily spoken out. Of course, it is best to be able to strive to be "tight-lipped." However, under a principle that is neither related to military secrets nor related to diplomatic secrets, we may as well talk about a few past events.

First, let's talk about Xu Shumo, the Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, before he entered the diplomatic world fourteen or fifteen years ago. Everyone knows that Xu Mo in the diplomatic world is from the lowest position, gradually rising from north to south, to the position of director, and then from the director of the European and American Department to the current position of Political Vice Minister. He is a modern Chinese political figure who is respectful, humble, and has no bureaucratic habits. He speaks very beautifully (he is good at diplomatic rhetoric but not glib.) He is familiar with very troublesome diplomatic etiquette, and he has no frivolous demeanor. Originally, he was an excellent English teacher in a middle school. He had no temper with his students, but the students were always afraid of him. Nowadays, some teachers often either perfunctorily deal with students in every way, or compress the curriculum so tightly that students dare to be angry but dare not speak out, and thus gain the favor of the principal. Xu Mo was not like this to his students. He believes that since students come to school to seek "knowledge," of course, questions and answers are most important. Especially in English teaching, to practice correct pronunciation and fluent response, he always has to call up many students in English to answer the questions he raises. Once, his principal (Li Quan, principal of the Eighth Middle School in Yangzhou) wanted to learn English and gently pushed into his classroom, sitting on the last row of school chairs. Mr. Xu, regardless of the principal's intention, still held the custom of calling up students in order according to the rows. Because when calling up students from the front to the back of each row, according to the custom of English teaching, it is possible to save time and convenience by simply saying "Next." The people behind will stand up when they hear it. Although Principal Li was sitting in the last row at the time, Mr. Xu did not let him go either. Principal Li was tall and burly, and running to the classroom to be a student was just as interesting as when Feng Huanzhang, Deputy Chairman of the Military Commission, went to the classroom of the Army University, making people notice it and feel interesting at first glance. When Principal Li was called up by Mr. Xu in English, because his English level was very low, he had to stand there blankly for a moment. Later, he never came to Mr. Xu's classroom again.

### Representatives of Chambers of Commerce from Various Regions Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday

Unanimously Endorsed the Results of the Income Tax Research Association; Telegraphed the Legislative Yuan to Pass the Commercial Registration Law

Representatives from chambers of commerce in various regions held a joint meeting at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce at 10:00 AM yesterday. Fourteen representatives from the chambers of commerce of Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, Jiangyin, Shaoxing, Jiaxing, Wujin, Yixing, Qingpu, and other counties attended. Sun Qianqing was elected chairman, and Yan Esheng was the recorder. The following resolutions were passed: ㊀ Regarding the results of the Income Tax Research Association's discussion, the important points should be telegraphed by the chambers of commerce in various regions to the Ministry of Finance for separate amendments and supplements: (A) Regarding income from profit-making enterprises, to expand the scope of public reserve funds, change the progressive amount to super-progressive, raise the starting point to 1%, increase the tax brackets, increase reasonable bad debt prediction reserves, capital official interest, and compensation for associate managers, and extend capital reporting to one month after the closing of accounts, totaling four points; (B) Regarding salary and remuneration, to raise the starting point to 50 yuan and increase the tax brackets, totaling two points; (C) Regarding income from securities interest, for stores withholding taxes, please refer to the bank's usual practice and give a 20% bonus; (D) Regarding accounting issues, the account books and records should only be taken to the extent that they are sufficient to prove the case, and the government should not forcibly change them to avoid disputes. ㊁ Regarding the business tax issue, the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce was assigned to draft the document, which will be jointly requested by chambers of commerce from various regions. ㊂ Telegraphed the Legislative Yuan to expedite the deliberation and implementation of the Commercial Registration Law as a remedy for joint and several liability for partnerships. The telegram was immediately sent as follows: To the Honorable Legislative Yuan in Nanjing: It has been found that regarding the amendment of the regulations on joint and several liability for partnership debts, your esteemed Yuan has adopted the opinions of the national business community and separately formulated the Commercial Registration Law to remedy this. However, because the draft was submitted in October of the 23rd year [of the Republic], opinions could not be unified and it has been stalled until now. The business community's hope that the law can be passed and implemented soon has been like one day for several years. Even the so-called hope for clouds and rain cannot describe their eagerness. During this period, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has sent three telegrams urging it and submitted two requests. At the same time, the joint associations of chambers of commerce in Shandong, Shanxi, and Hunan provinces, as well as the chambers of commerce in Qingdao, Yantai, Chongqing, Nanning, Chang'an, Guangzhou, Shantou, and other cities and counties, have also telegraphed your esteemed Yuan to quickly pass the draft so that it can become law and be used as a basis. In July of the 25th year, when the chambers of commerce of various provinces held a joint meeting in Shanghai to assist in anti-smuggling efforts, they also submitted a statement stating that the law urgently needs to be deliberated and implemented, and representatives were sent to the capital to present their case to your esteemed Yuan. In summary of the above, this matter has been stalled for two years and three months, which is not a short time. Those who have petitioned for an early deliberation are from various provinces, counties, and cities, and their expectations are not insignificant. However, to this day, there is still no news of the draft being submitted to the Yuan for deliberation, which is deeply worrying. This time, the chambers of commerce were invited by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to study income tax matters and attended the meeting in Shanghai. They all believe that the draft is an important law related to the issue of merchant debt liability. According to the principle of "initiative" in the four powers, your esteemed Yuan has the responsibility to adapt to the needs of the people and formulate the law when the people need a certain law. Moreover, according to the document that your esteemed Yuan sent to the Executive Yuan in the 23rd year, it said that according to the review report, Article 681 of the Civil Code Debt Compilation does not need to be amended, and the Commercial Registration Law can be formulated separately for partnership organizations as a remedy. Since the Yuan has expressed this opinion to the outside world, the deliberation and implementation of the law is tantamount to the entire intention of the legislative body, and it is not appropriate to shelve the case for a long time, which would be tantamount to changing the Yuan's opinion. It is also found that in recent years, commercial liquidation cases have all been affected by joint and several liability, so those who should be responsible according to their shares are also avoiding and seeking to escape. Therefore, creditors have no recourse, and cases that are satisfactorily resolved are few and far between. If liability can be borne according to shares, then the debts will be lighter due to individual sharing, and those who know how to value themselves will definitely be willing to stand up. The creditor's gains will be more than those who strictly enforce joint and several liability. Things are the opposite, but they complement each other, so it cannot be viewed superficially. The representatives of the chambers of commerce represent the business community and have true knowledge and insights into the pros and cons of this matter. They have no choice but to repeatedly petition your esteemed Yuan in order to implement the original intention of the petition over the years. It is reasonable to telegraph your esteemed Yuan for review and approval, and to grant the draft for immediate deliberation and implementation, which is in the public interest. Hangzhou City Chamber of Commerce, Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce, Jiangyin County Chamber of Commerce, Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce, Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, Changshu County Chamber of Commerce, Qingpu County Chamber of Commerce, Kunshan County Chamber of Commerce, Fengxian County Chamber of Commerce, Shaoxing County Chamber of Commerce, Yixing County Chamber of Commerce, Wujin County Chamber of Commerce, Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce, representatives attending the Income Tax Research Association, and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully request.

### The Income Tax Research Association Closed Last Night

Representatives of Chambers of Commerce from Various Regions Say Goodbye

The Income Tax Research Association convened by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce held a public banquet for accountant Xu Yongzuo at noon yesterday. At 3:00 PM, the meeting continued, and accountants Pan Xulun, Xi Yushu, and Li Wenjie were invited to give speeches. It closed at 6:00 PM. The details are recorded as follows:

Grand Banquet at Noon

At 12:00 noon, representatives from various chambers of commerce and industry associations in Shanghai, as well as company representatives, held a public banquet for accountant Xu Yongzuo on the seventh floor of the New Asia Hotel. 145 representatives attended, with Qian Sunqing, Gu Suming, and Wang Jiean presiding. During the banquet, the chairman gave a speech, expressing deep gratitude to accountant Xu for attending the research association and providing guidance and explanations. Chen Ziyi, a representative from the bean and rice industry, gave a speech on behalf of the industry associations in Shanghai, thanking him and reporting on the industry's unified accounting books. Next, Xu Yongzuo gave a reply, explaining the accountant's mission and expressing his hopes: ㊀ Chambers of commerce in various regions should organize special committees on income tax to continue research; ㊁ Chambers of commerce in various regions should organize accounting committees to discuss gradual improvements to accounting bookkeeping methods. Next, Yan Esheng stated the good impressions gained from this research association and reported that the organization of industrial and commercial enterprises has become increasingly sound in recent years, and the relationship between industry and commerce and the state has become increasingly close. The interpretation of various industrial and commercial laws and regulations often has a direct or indirect impact on industrial and commercial enterprises. After the implementation of income tax, there will inevitably be more interpretations and approvals in the future, which requires attention. He is currently launching "Knowledge of Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations," which will interpret and publish various interpretations of commercial law, commerce, commercial affairs, trademarks, organization of merchant groups, and various tax laws, as found in various gazettes and official documents, and distribute them to various industrial and commercial institutions, groups, companies, and merchants for research and reference. It is expected to be realized within three months. At that time, he hopes that the representatives will provide guidance. Finally, the presidium representatives presented Mr. Xu with a silver tripod with the words "Show Me the Way," and added the following: "In January of the 26th year [of the Republic], the chambers of commerce of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the industry associations of Shanghai responded to the invitation of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to open an Income Tax Research Association. Accountant Xu Yongzuo was selected as an expert to preside over the research. He analyzed the gains and losses of the tax system in detail and pointed out the key points, which greatly benefited the merchants. Out of gratitude, we write this and present it to him." After the banquet, a commemorative photo was taken in the New Asia Garden.

Lecture Conference

At 3:00 PM, the Income Tax Lecture Conference was held, with 142 representatives attending, with Ke Ganzhen presiding and Ye Zhizhong recording. First, the chairman gave a speech, briefly stating that the results of this research association were very satisfactory. The task from now on is for the chambers of commerce in various regions to work together, on the one hand, to lead merchants and explain the meaning of income tax, and on the other hand, to request the government to amend the regulations to avoid "harshness," so that the implementation will not become a "disturbance." As for the issues that were not discussed or were not discussed in detail due to time constraints, the chamber of commerce should form a special committee and hire experts to continue the research. Next, accountants Xi Yushu, Pan Xulun, and Li Wenjie gave speeches successively. ㊀ Mr. Xi briefly said that what he wanted to discuss was the relationship between income tax and accounting. He now offers three points for discussion. First, establish a simple accounting system. Everyone here knows that the accounting department is simple and not very complicated. However, given the vastness of China, I am afraid that there are many who do not understand this subject very well. We can close the door and talk frankly. Chinese accounts have always been considered unpublishable because they have never been published. Because they have never been published, the accounting skills and the completeness of the account books have not been well studied. Even in Shanghai, not to mention the accounting system, some merchants simply do not have account books and only rely on a handwritten booklet. Accounting is out of the question. Now that the government is implementing income tax, because we usually pay too little attention to accounting, many people will naturally feel troubled. The first urgent task at present is to establish an accounting system and reorganize the unreasonable accounts of the past. If you want to continue with a muddled account, refuse to publish it, and do not want to reorganize it, then you will suffer when paying taxes. But how should the reorganization plan be done? How should we start the reorganization? We should request the Ministry of Finance to convene accounting experts and scholars to formulate the simplest and most definite accounting system for the whole country to adopt. Because I advocate that we must first make the people understand how to do the accounts before we can understand how to pay taxes. Second, revise the simple declaration form. We request that the income tax authorities formulate a very simple declaration form. The one currently formulated, although very complete and detailed, cannot be universally understood by most people. Regarding this point, because the Chinese people do not study accounting subjects very much, it can be said to be a serious problem. Now that the new tax system is being implemented, the collecting authorities can only be lenient in inspection and punishment, otherwise the people will often violate the law and be punished. In reality, the people are not intentionally violating the law and are definitely not knowingly violating the law. I think the government certainly does not want the people to violate the law due to a lack of understanding of the method of paying taxes, and at the same time does not want the people to mistakenly recognize good taxes as bad taxes. Third, regarding the issue of accounting inspection, we have also mostly neglected the issue of accounting inspection in the past. Now we should determine our respective internal accounting inspection work. We can see in the newspapers every day that companies and merchants are going bankrupt. If we explore the reasons, it is by no means a simple business failure. Various errors and frauds occur mostly because accounting is unreasonable and not on the right track. In general, merchants are profitable on the surface at the end of the year, but there are many accounts payable that have not been paid out, and in general, shareholders do not ask about the business's profits and losses, but only seek to receive official interest at the end of the year. As a result, many intentional frauds follow. This is all the result of not paying attention to internal accounting inspection at ordinary times. We should often inspect it in the future to ensure that the records on the books are consistent with the actual situation of the business. When the accounts are clear, we will have a standard for paying taxes, and accounting will be determined and the account books will be complete, which will definitely increase the belief of the outside world. Our accounting business is not passive, it is not just like a doctor diagnosing a disease. We hope that society will allow us to check our health before we get sick, and no longer seek treatment after we get sick. Everyone should find ways to maintain health and increase health. We must wait until the time of declaring bankruptcy and liquidation to find us. This is really not the original intention of our accountants' business. ㊁ Mr. Pan briefly said that what I want to contribute is a general review of the resolutions of your meeting. According to the newspaper reports, the results of the research of your association in recent days are mostly in line with the opinions of the colleagues in the office. (Omitted) Now I will discuss and supplement a few points worth discussing with you. ㊀ Regarding the case of retaining the cash basis accounting system for store bookkeeping, your association decided that "this association has clear regulations in Articles 90 and 2 of the first category of collection guidelines," and it seems unnecessary to discuss it. My opinion is that in the United States, which is the most developed in the implementation of income tax, its history shows that the implementation of the accrual basis (i.e., the accrual basis) was delayed until more than 50 years later before it was legally permitted. Because the advancement of accounting knowledge has not been popularized and the accounting system has not been universally improved, it is originally impossible to expect most people to adopt the accrual basis to force its profit and loss calculation of accumulated cases. Therefore, my opinion is that the accounting system mentioned in the income tax laws and regulations of our country should follow the American method, allowing taxpayers to choose their own system. The cash basis is acceptable, and the accrual basis is also acceptable. However, once adopted, it is not allowed to be changed arbitrarily, and it is not necessary to obtain the permission of the competent authority when changing. This will maximize the benefits of promotion and avoid abuses. ㊁ Article 12, Paragraph 3 of the first category of collection guidelines, free donations cannot be regarded as necessary and reasonable expenses and losses in business. Your association advocates that free donations should exclude public welfare and charitable donations (such as donations for purchasing machines and celebrating birthdays). However, for example, merchants' social entertainment, gifts, and banquets are neither charitable nor public welfare. These kinds of social entertainment have the hope of increasing business income. The distinction between various expenses that are unrelated to the business is very cumbersome. This work, I think, can be entrusted to the review committee, because it cannot be determined by the provisions. Therefore, the third paragraph is amended to "free donations that are unrelated to the business." ㊂ Your association's resolution has a petition to the Ministry of Finance to add "reasonable prediction of bad debt losses" in Article 19 of the asset valuation method. My opinion is that these two cannot be mentioned in the same breath. The forecast and separate estimation methods can only be used one of them, and they can never be used at the same time. Assuming that the two methods are used together, the separate estimation can be taken for less on the books, and the separate estimation can be abandoned and the forecast can be taken for more on the books, which opens the door to trickery and seems to be worth discussing. ㊃ Your association's resolution has "goodwill is business rights, which has been stipulated in Article 13 of the asset valuation method, and it seems unnecessary to discuss it." My opinion is that Article 13 of the asset valuation method stipulates that business rights are ten years and copyrights are seven years, which is too rigid. Among the copyrights in our country, those with permanent value, such as the Analects of Confucius and Mencius, are of infinite value. How can they be limited to ten years? It is also very common for companies and merchants to establish contracts for less than ten years. The law must take into account the facts. This point is also requested that the review committee be responsible for determining goodwill. ㊄ Your association's resolution has "a petition to the Ministry of Finance to amend Article 12, Paragraph 2 of the first category of collection guidelines, deleting the nine characters "associate manager and other employees." My opinion is that this case is certainly very good from the perspective of reducing the burden on taxpayers. However, from a theoretical point of view, since taxation is based on individual character and the income from profits is based on industrial and commercial institutions as independent units, the benefits distributed by the associate manager are also included in the tax because the personality is different. ㊅ Your association's agenda has "the implementation of income tax" should immediately stop business tax to show fairness and avoid double taxation." My opinion is that this should be proposed at the same time as the salt tax that the general public cannot afford and the export tax that hinders export trade, and a request should be made to abolish them. We believe that good taxes, whether direct taxes or local taxes, should be promoted and bad taxes should be abolished. (Omitted) ㊂ Mr. Li briefly said ㊀ The income tax currently implemented in our country adopts a classified tax system. In the United Kingdom, an integrated tax system is adopted. The so-called integration is to comprehensively calculate and levy taxes from all aspects. The procedures are certainly more troublesome, but the result is a fair burden. The interim regulations are classified as very complicated, but the integrated system cannot be implemented immediately. I mean that at least the legal text must add additional tax methods. This is not the burden of the general class. At this time of serious national crisis, those who are rich should fulfill more tax obligations, right? ㊁ The interim regulations do not tax real estate. The legislative authorities' reason is that the countryside is bankrupt and the cities are declining, and they cite the Land Law, which imposes a large burden on land price tax. In fact, from a legal point of view, the land tax collection method is the opposite of income tax, because the legislative principle of the Land Law is based on the principle of the people's livelihood, equalizing land rights and encouraging people to use them. The land tax collection regulations of the Land Law stipulate that the tax rate for municipal wasteland is 30/1000 to 100/1000 of the fixed land price, the tax rate for rural wasteland is 15/1000 to 100/1000, the tax rate for municipal unimproved land is 15/1000 to 30/1000, the tax rate for rural unimproved land is 12/1000 to 15/1000, the tax rate for municipal improved land is 10/1000 to 20/1000, and the tax rate for rural improved land is 10/1000. This is contrary to the principle of income tax, which is to pay more for more and must pay. Now the wasteland donation collected in this city is also the same reason for encouraging people to use it. Therefore, the non-collection of income tax on real estate cannot be based on the Land Law. Currently, the Land Law has not been implemented, so the large landlords can enjoy tax exemption, which seems too unfair. ㊂ The investigation and review articles stipulated in Chapter 4 of the interim regulations are too complicated. For example, if a taxpayer is dissatisfied with the notice of the amount of tax payable determined by the competent collection agency, he may request a review within 20 days. If he is dissatisfied with the review, he may request the review committee to determine it within 10 days. If he is still dissatisfied, he may file an administrative appeal or lawsuit. It is really necessary to advocate reducing the trouble of turning around. ㊃ The depreciation rate calculation table of the asset valuation method attached to the first category of collection guidelines is a specialized technical table, including eight regulations on depreciation years. I think that although there is flexibility, it cannot be fully utilized. It seems that the minimum limit can be further reduced. For example, building a house on rented land, signing a contract for 25 years, and completely handing it over to the landowner upon expiration. There are no corresponding regulations on how to calculate the depreciation method. In addition, houses and machinery are advancing with the times and should be clearly stated. The calculation table takes the enumeration method and lacks flexibility, and should be remedied. (Omitted)

Representatives Leave Shanghai

Representatives of the chambers of commerce from various regions came to Shanghai on the 19th of this month. The research association closed yesterday, a total of seven days. After the closing, the chambers of commerce of Zhenjiang, Jiaxing, Wujin, and other places left Shanghai that night. It is heard that after the representatives return to their original counties, they will convene meetings of the chambers of commerce in various places to report on the research results, form special committees, continue to study, and schedule a second research meeting in March or April if necessary.

### Yesterday's Symposium of the International Problems Research Association

Director of the External Intelligence Department, Li Dijun, Speaks on the Diplomatic Situation of the Past Year

The International Problems Research Association held a symposium at the Bankers' Association yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, and invited Li Dijun, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to speak. More than 50 members of the association and representatives from various universities attended, including He Bingsong, Lin Kanghou, Liu Zhanen, Huang Renzhi, Zhu Shaoping, Shou Jingwei, and Dai Baoliu. A Central News Agency reporter recorded the details as follows:

Chairman's Address

First, Liu Zhanen, Chairman of the International Problems Research Association, gave an opening speech, stating that the association was reorganized from the Liaison Committee of the Local Maintenance Association after the January 28th Incident. Considering the importance of international issues, no less than national defense and economic issues, it has aroused great attention from the people. Today, we specially invite representatives from all sectors of education in the city to hold a symposium to explore diplomatic issues. Currently, the most attention-grabbing issues are the Sino-Japanese issue, the Sino-Soviet issue, and what diplomatic methods our country should adopt with the great powers and the League of Nations. I hope that everyone will express their valuable opinions and study together. Now, I would like to invite Director Li to speak, so that we may use it as a basis for our research.

Mr. Li's Speech

After Chairman Liu Zhanen's opening speech, Li Dijun, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stood up to speak. He first gave a detailed analysis of the various so-called ways out for Chinese diplomacy, such as the so-called Tokyo route, Moscow route, and Geneva route. Next, he reported on the diplomatic situation of our country in the past year, with particular emphasis on Sino-Japanese relations, Sino-Soviet relations, and China's relations with the League of Nations. Furthermore, based on the diplomatic situation of the past year, he speculated on the future diplomatic trends of China, stating that: ❶ China's diplomacy, due to the increase in national strength, has gradually reached a stage of autonomy and initiative, with a clear and firm stance, adhering to it unswervingly. ❷ China's current stage of diplomacy is multilateral diplomacy, not limited to any country or any group, trying to adjust diplomatic relations with Japan through normal diplomatic channels, while supporting the League of Nations, maintaining international peace, and promoting international cooperation. On the other hand, maintaining and enhancing friendly relations with the Soviet Union and European and American countries, in preparation for further cooperation when necessary. Finally, he said that diplomacy and domestic affairs have an inseparable relationship. One point of national strength increases, and diplomacy also increases accordingly. With strength, there is a way to handle diplomacy, and any path can be taken. Without strength, no path can be taken. The people of the country should unite sincerely, strive for survival through their own efforts, and not harbor any侥倖 psychology.

Mr. Shou's Speech

Subsequently, Shou Jingwei, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, gave a speech on "The Formation of Pan-Asianism and the East Asian Economic Group." In today's situation where Sino-Japanese relations are intermittent, all issues of economic cooperation and cultural cooperation are out of the question. A further East Asian economic group seems like a futile dream and will hardly become a reality. However, for the sake of the permanent interests of both China and Japan, economic cooperation, if based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, is not only possible in fact, but also necessary for the survival and development of the two major nations of China and Japan. As for the organization and promotion of the East Asian economic group, China and Japan should jointly shoulder the responsibility. The economic policies of the two countries should naturally take the maintenance of their own national interests as the fundamental principle, but within the maximum possible scope, both sides should also try to avoid conflicts of interest in industry or trade. All forms of aggressive cooperation and submissive cooperation are no longer compatible with the spirit of the times, and major obstacles that hinder the permanent interests of economic cooperation between the two countries should be removed in appropriate ways. He who tied the bell must untie it. We cannot but hope for the far-sighted and well-managed Japanese authorities. As early as 1924, Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated Pan-Asianism for Asian countries, and said that the thorough abolition of unequal treaties concluded by Japan with European and American countries could be regarded as the beginning of the rejuvenation of all Asian nations, and he placed his hopes on Japan with enthusiastic sympathy for supporting China's abolition of unequal treaties. Now, ten years have passed, and China's political economy has made considerable progress. Recently, Chairman Chiang was able to move with utmost sincerity in the Xi'an Incident, making the foundation of the country safe again. The opportunity for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation can no longer be suppressed by any force. The time is now. The fundamental adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations must be realized through diplomatic and military strategies in extraordinary times. It is hoped that the Japanese government's policy towards China can have a epoch-making transformation. As for the constituent elements of the East Asian economic group, China and Japan each have their own special positions, and other weaker nations should also have their due status. The current world economic organization has a new trend of overall control. Our country's economic policy should also aim at a controlled economy, and implement Mr. Sun's great industrial plan with an active and independent spirit and a sound and complete organization. The economic group of East Asian countries should take the common and permanent interests of all nations as its basis. Although it is still questionable whether the formation of this economic group can be gradually promoted by peaceful means to achieve the final goal, the safety of the overall situation in East Asia is at stake, and the people of insight in both China and Japan should give it deep and detailed consideration. Whether it is for co-existence and co-prosperity, or for mutual destruction, the choice of gains and losses is not only the natural duty of the governments of the two countries, but also the understanding that the people of the two countries should have.

Discussion

After the speech, the chairman, taking Mr. Li's speech as the center, invited the attendees to freely express their opinions. Those who stood up to speak included Lin Kanghou, He Bingsong, Gui Zhongshu, Shou Jingwei, Geng Danru, Lin Die, Meng Zhi, and many representatives from Guanghua, Daxia, Soochow, and St. John's universities. Their eloquent speeches were very impressive. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. That evening at 7:30 PM, the International Problems Research Association held a banquet at the Bankers' Association to welcome Director Li. The atmosphere was very cheerful, and the banquet ended at 9:00 PM.

### Zhou Jue Regularly Hosts Leaders from All Walks of Life

Zhou Jue, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in order to connect with the emotions of all walks of life in the city, has scheduled a tea party at his office at No. 6 Difeng Road from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM on the 29th of this month, to entertain leaders from the industrial and commercial sectors, so as to have a pleasant gathering. The invitation cards have been sent out.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Implements Austerity Measures, Laying Off Over a Thousand Road Workers

Workers Panic, Submit Petitions to the Party and Government, and Send Representatives to Various Parties to Plead

According to Dagong News Agency, there are more than 1,200 road construction workers in the Public Concession's Municipal Council. Recently, due to the Council's implementation of cost-saving measures, it was announced that nine-tenths of the workers would be laid off by the end of this month. Upon hearing this news, the workers were panic-stricken. Yesterday, they sent representatives to various agencies and groups to plead for assistance. The details are as follows:

Submitting Petitions to the Party and Government

Yesterday, more than 1,200 road construction workers of the Municipal Council sent representatives to jointly petition the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Government, the General Labor Union, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and other agencies and groups, requesting assistance. The petition stated: "We are petitioning regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession implementing austerity measures and laying off workers, requesting relief. We have been working in the Transportation Group of the Public Concession's Municipal Council for one or two decades. Regardless of the wind and snow or the scorching sun, we have been working diligently. At the same time, there are those who have sacrificed their lives to be loyal to their work. However, the price we pay for our labor and lives is not enough to support our families, so we are already lingering on, living each day like a year. Now, the Municipal Council has suddenly implemented a policy of austerity measures and laying off workers, wanting to dismiss all Chinese workers by drawing lots, leaving only about one-tenth. This will be implemented on the 30th of this month. Upon hearing this news, we cannot help but be terrified. At the beginning of the opening of the concession, the four lands were desolate and the population was sparse. In recent years, the roads have been widened and the number of vehicles has increased. In fact, there is a need to add workers, not reduce them. If a large number of workers are innocently dismissed due to market problems, how can we bear it? This kind of austerity measures not only declares our entire workforce unemployed, but also causes our families to starve. It is unreasonable and illegal. Moreover, we have served faithfully and diligently, without any unprincipled or illegal behavior, and to dismiss us without reason is not allowed even by international public law. Therefore, we specially ask you to uphold justice and handle the negotiations, and hope that the Council will withdraw its decision in order to stabilize the people's livelihood. This would be a virtue."

Representatives Plead

Yesterday, dozens of road construction workers of the Municipal Council, including representatives Li Jingchun, Liu Huanwen, Huan Buying, Li Binggao, Tao Shizhi, Shen Zhongyuan, Bian Desheng, Cai Furong, Wang Lisheng, and Wang Shuangcai, took their petitions to the Citizens' Union of the First Special District at 1:00 PM. Committee member Chen Jiufeng received them and agreed to assist with the workers' request. Then, they went to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association to petition, where Secretary Tao Leqin received them and agreed to submit the petition to the chairman and committee members for review. Finally, they went to the General Labor Union, the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, and other agencies to petition, requesting assistance.

### Yesterday, Workers from Japanese Textile Factories United to Petition but Were Blocked

Demanding that the Council Negotiate for Reinstatement

The workers of Japanese textile factories such as Toyota in western Shanghai, who were laid off after the last workers' strike, totaled about two hundred. At 9:00 AM yesterday, they gathered on Zhongshan Road and walked to the Social Affairs Bureau in the city center to petition, demanding negotiations for reinstatement. When they reached Gonghe Road in Zhabei, they were stopped by police officers, who ordered them to send representatives. The workers refused, causing a disturbance. They were then dispersed by the police officers.

### The Tea Industry Delegation to Japan Returned to Shanghai Yesterday

Releasing a Written Statement Detailing the Inspection Process

Our country's tea industry delegation to Japan, consisting of Hong Chunzhi, Song Qifan, Li Naichang, Ning Weiting, Tao Zhensheng, Hu Yezhi, and Secretary Yu Gumin, totaling seven people, departed from Shanghai on the 6th of this month and has completed the inspection. They returned to the country from Kobe on the Nagasaki Maru of the Japanese Postal Steamship Company on the 22nd, arriving at the Osaka Wharf in Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Those who went to the wharf to welcome them included Ye Shichang, chairman of the Yangzhuang Tea Industry Trade Association, as well as more than 50 representatives from Xielong, Zhenhe, and other tea warehouses and tea merchants, including Zhu Yanqing and Chen Yizhou, all holding welcome banners. After the delegation landed, they took cars to the Yangzhuang Tea Industry Trade Association in Gujia Lane, Beijing Road, to rest.

Releasing a Statement

The delegation released a written statement on the ship yesterday, stating: "This time, we went to Japan to inspect the tea industry, spending a short period of time traveling to Nagasaki, Kobe, Tokyo, Shizuoka, Kyoto, Osaka, and other places. We received guidance from Ambassador Xu and Commercial Counselor, hospitality from the embassy staff and local consuls, and introductions from the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai and the Tokyo Japan-China Society. We were able to approach various Japanese tea industry organizations and fully visit tea gardens and tea factories, obtaining detailed inspections. The overall impression was very good. The boundaries between agriculture, industry, and commerce in the Japanese tea industry are very clear. The Japanese government provides full assistance to the positions of tea farmers, tea factories, and tea merchants. At the same time, those engaged in the tea industry, whether they are tea farmers, tea factories, or tea merchants, have great trust in the government. Therefore, the organization and management of the tea industry has a solid system, in an orderly manner. The people of that country are also very concerned about our country's tea industry. Even the inherent strengths of our country's tea industry are not necessarily maintained and adopted. According to the director of the central conference of the tea industry association, the highest tea industry authority in that country, the Japanese tea industry is currently adopting a division of labor and cooperation system, so that tea farmers are tea farmers, tea factories are tea factories, and tea merchants are tea merchants. The more detailed the division of labor, the better. Moreover, the people who run the tea industry are guided administratively by the various conferences of the tea industry association. The government separately establishes a tea industry research institute and experimental field to study improved methods of planting and manufacturing for tea farmers, tea factories, and tea merchants to adopt. It can be seen that various Japanese industries are trending towards scientification. Looking at their organizational methods, our country cannot help but be far behind in comparison. A detailed report of the delegation's inspection will be disclosed after it is sorted out."

Association Welcome

At 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, members of the Yangzhuang Tea Industry Trade Association welcomed all members of the tea industry delegation to Japan and their secretary at the association's auditorium in Gujia Lane, Beijing Road. More than 30 representatives from more than ten companies, including Xielong Tea Warehouse, including Zhu Yanqing, attended. Chairman Ye Shichang delivered a welcome speech, saying: "In order to improve our country's tea industry manufacturing and develop the foreign trade of Chinese tea, we specially organized a delegation to inspect Japan. Now they have returned to Shanghai. I hope that they will contribute what they have learned from the inspection to our members, so as to serve as a reference for tea industry improvement." Then, delegate Hong Chunzhi gave a brief report. The event ended at around 5:00 PM. As for the detailed report, it is currently being sorted out.

### Record of contemporary people's whereabouts

Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, took the flower car last night with Xu Kan and Zou Lin, two vice ministers of finance, and took the night express train to Beijing to preside over the Executive Yuan's routine meeting. In addition, Central Committee member Chen Gongbo, Vice Minister of Railways Zeng Rongpu, and Legislative Committee member Fu Rulin also took the night express train to Beijing last night.

Xiong Shihui, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, took the Capital Express train out of Beijing at 5:30 PM yesterday afternoon and arrived in Shanghai at 10:20 PM last night.

### Yan Huiqing Went to Hangzhou Yesterday

Dr. Yan Huiqing, former ambassador to the Soviet Union, arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin a few days ago to visit friends. He has been very busy with social engagements in recent days. It is now learned that Mr. Yan responded to a friend's telegram and took the Shanghai-Hangzhou early express train from Shanghai to Hangzhou at 8:25 AM on the 25th. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 28th.

Lu Appointed as Attendant Minister of the Papal Envoy, Enthusiastic Farewell at the Wharf Last Night from All Walks of Life

The Catholic Church will hold the International Eucharistic Congress in Manila, Philippines, on February 3, with more than 200,000 participants praying for world peace. In addition to the special envoy sent by the Pope to preside over the ceremony, various countries have sent representatives to participate. Our country was specially commissioned by Archbishop Cai Ning, Chairman of the General Assembly of the Chinese Catholic Action Association, Lu Bohong, to organize the pilgrimage group, which will be divided into two batches. The first batch has already departed yesterday, led by Mr. Lu, on the German steamer Bosteden. The details are as follows:

### Lu Bohong Lu Yingen

Number of Group Members

The first batch of departing group members includes Bishop Zhu of Haimen, Bishop Gu of Yichang, Bishop Yang of Jinan, Bishop Shi of Xinyang, Bishop Dai of Ningbo, Bishop Wang of Zhumadian, Bishop Shu of Yanzhou, Bishop Tian of Yanggu, Bishop Shi of Liaoning, Bishop He of Caozhou, and others, as well as Dean Leng, Father Mei, Xu Zongze, Ding Rucheng, Zhang Weiping, Jiang Daoyuan, Zhu Minghao, Liu Shunqin, Wen Huaji, Zhu Zhiyao, Liu Changyin, Liu Fuchu, Lai Rongsheng, Mei Boqiao, Shen Qiaoxun, and Mr. Lu's daughters Lu Zengzuo, Lu Deyi, and his three daughters-in-law Lu Guo, Lu Liu, Liu Xiuzhen, and more than a hundred other people.

### Pilgrimage Group Taking Photos on Board (Photo by Wang Kai)

Departure Situation

All group members gathered at the Datong Wharf at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, and then set off in formation, with the national flag and the Pope's flag leading the way, followed by the Zhengxiu Middle School music team and primary and middle school students. Group members took cars, and those who participated in the farewell included leaders of various churches, priests, representatives of various district public advancement associations, Datong Shipping Company, China Electric Company, Chongming Shipping Company, and representatives from St. Heart Hospital, Xin Puyu Hall, Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, and others, totaling six or seven hundred people. Along the way, Wang Hong and Wang Er, special photographers sent by the Central Photography Studio to Manila, filmed newsreels. Group members arrived at the wharf and boarded the Chongming Company's special ship Tianyou, which was decorated with flags and slogans. At 4:00 PM, amidst music and firecrackers, the ship left the port and headed straight for the Bosteden. Mr. Lu and others shook hands with the farewell personnel. It is reported that the ship will set sail this morning.

Receiving New Orders

It is reported that the group leader, Lu Bohong, is a newly appointed Papal Knight of the Sword and Robe, and he is bringing the full dress with him to thank the Papal Envoy in person. The leader, Lu Yingen, was recently awarded the Papal Golden Cross Medal and will also thank the Papal Envoy in person. Mr. Lu has also been appointed by the Holy See as the Attendant Minister of the Papal Envoy of this International Eucharistic Congress and will live in the Quezon Presidential Palace.

Mr. Lu's Remarks

The reporter met group leader Lu Bohong on board and was pleased to hear his remarks. The main idea was that the International Eucharistic Congress is of global nature, and its sacredness, greatness, solemnity, and grandeur break any gathering record. The Holy Body being welcomed is the true master of heaven, earth, gods, and all things, the King of Kings, and the Lord of Lords. We humans are all creatures, and in front of the True Lord, we are as small as dust and dirt. Therefore, at each Congress, leaders from all countries must participate, expressing their pain, repentance, humility, and self-preservation. This time, the Manila event is the first grand event in the Far East. Although I am at the end of the year and have many secular affairs, I will also go to participate. In addition to praying for world peace, I will also pray especially for China, so that the Holy Church will flourish and the nation will be revived. Also, Lu Yingen, the leader of the preparations for this pilgrimage, also shared his remarks, stating briefly that he was fortunate to be the leader of the 1933 Rome pilgrimage, and this time he was again appointed as the leader of the Manila pilgrimage. He will guide his fellow travelers under the guidance of the captain and deputy captains, using his previous experiences abroad. It is estimated that the Philippines has tens of millions of Catholics, accounting for 80% of the country's population, almost becoming a Catholic country. We are going there to pray for our motherland, so that the Holy Church will spread widely and the number of Catholics will gradually increase. The International Eucharistic Congress will have a day to be held in China. After the affairs in the Philippines are completed, I will go to Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangdong to inspect charity, education, and industry.

### Yesterday, the Workers in the Ivory and Bone Utensil Industry Petitioned After the Strike

Forming a Famine Strike Group and Insisting to the End, Vowing Not to Resume Work Until the Goal is Achieved

More than 3,000 workers in the ivory and bone utensil industry in this city, because a small number of capitalists refused to implement a unified wage, caused a total strike the day before yesterday. In addition to making six demands, they also decided to petition the Party and government agencies. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the workers sent Yang Guoliang and Li Kaiyi to lead more than a hundred workers to the Shanghai General Labor Union to petition. Fang Rusheng of the General Labor Union received them and agreed to accept the workers' demands, send personnel to investigate, and then review the matter. Then, they went to the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee in Fenglin Bridge to petition, where Wu Wenbang, a cadre of the Civil Movement Section of the Municipal Party Committee, received them. He promised to forward the petition to the Municipal Executive Committee for instructions and review, and advised the workers to strictly observe order and wait quietly for the resolution. The workers originally planned to petition the Social Affairs Bureau again, but due to lack of time, it was rescheduled for today. They then convened a representative conference at Jishan Temple in Nanshi, attended by more than 400 people. Wang Fugen was publicly elected as chairman. After the ceremony, the chairman reported on the petition process, and then discussed various cases, listing: ❶ Advising all workers to strictly abide by discipline and wait quietly for the Party and government agencies to mediate according to the law. ❷ Not to work privately before the matter is resolved, and those who violate the strike discipline will be regarded as traitors and running dogs. ❸ All workers vowed not to resume work until the victory goal is achieved. ❹ Organizing the Shanghai Ivory and Bone Utensil Industry Workers' Famine Strike Group, and starting registration immediately. ❺ A resolution was passed on the proposal to request assistance from all walks of life, and a letter to all walks of life was published. Also, the union convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors at 9:00 AM yesterday, attended by more than a dozen people. Yang Guoliang was publicly elected as chairman. After the ceremony, the chairman first reported on the purpose of the meeting and the recent situation of the union, and then began the discussion. Important proposals listed: ❶ Regarding the refusal of a small number of capitalists to implement a unified wage, which has evolved into a labor unrest, and the striking workers requesting assistance from the union, how should it be carried out? It was resolved: (1) Accept the workers' demands. (2) Submit a request to the Party and government agencies to mediate quickly. ❷ The striking workers requested the union to send personnel to lead the workers to petition the Municipal Party Committee, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Shanghai General Labor Union. It was resolved to appoint Yang Guoliang and Li Kaiyi to lead the workers to petition. ❸ The union issued a notice advising the workers to strictly observe order and not take any excessive actions.

### Yesterday, the Hehai Alumni Association Hosted a Farewell Banquet for Xu Kai and Others

And Welcomed Sun Shixiong's Return to the Country

Xu Kai, Chief Engineer of the Huai River Guidance Committee, is going to Europe at the invitation of the League of Nations to discuss water conservancy technology issues. At the same time, Lei Hongji and Chen Zhiding are also going to Europe and the United States on behalf of the Huai River Guidance Committee and the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Construction Department to inspect water conservancy projects. All three are alumni of the River and Sea Engineering Department of the former National Water Conservancy Bureau. They will leave Shanghai on the Bosteden on the 26th of this month. Last night, the Shanghai Alumni Association of the school held a farewell banquet at the Yu Qiaqing Jinlong Restaurant. During the banquet, former principals Yang Yunzhong and Yan Yiting delivered welcome speeches, and Mr. Xu and others gave detailed accounts of their experiences before going abroad and their inspection plans. That evening, Sun Shixiong, an alumnus of the school who was sent to the United Kingdom by the Huai River Guidance Committee to practice water conservancy engineering, happened to return to the country yesterday. The alumni of the school welcomed him together and washed away the dust. Mr. Sun has done in-depth research on new British dam and gate projects and dredging machinery. It is reported that he will return to the Huai River Guidance Committee to work in the near future.

### A Japanese Marine Was Cursed by a British Man

Japanese Residents Believe It Was an Insult

According to the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun, at 6:30 PM on the 24th, a British man, passing by Old Bazizi Road, saw a Japanese marine standing guard on the road and loudly scolded "Bastard pig." The Japanese soldier heard the sound and rushed to the British man to question him. This was seen by an officer from the Hongkou Department of the Municipal Council, who took the British man and the marine to the Japanese military police station on Zhaopu Road, and then to the Hongkou Patrol Room. Because the British man was drunk and gave irrelevant answers, the Japanese residents believed that the foreigner insulted the Japanese and urged the authorities to fundamentally resolve the matter.

### The Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Troop Held a Fifth Anniversary Memorial for the Four Martyrs

During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, members of the City Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Troop, including Luo Yunxiang and others, went deep into the war zone, served and died for the country. The Boy Scout General Association and others built a memorial tower in the Chamber of Commerce and a clothing tomb in the Shanghai Public Cemetery in Jiangwan.

### The Yangtze River Rises Again, Ships Can Pass Through Xunhan

For the past few days, the water level in the Yangtze River has dropped sharply, and large river ships of various companies have been blocked in Wuhu and unable to go upstream. All passengers and cargo destined for Jiujiang and Hankou have been transferred to barges in Wuhu. Upstream and downstream ships have often run aground, resulting in the Yangtze River being divided into two sections. Shanghai to Wuhu is unobstructed, and Wuhu to Hankou restricts the draft, preventing large ships from sailing upstream. This has caused the Yangtze River to be half-open and half-blocked. Although the shallow water fee has been increased, shipping companies are still suffering losses. Just as they were worried, it suddenly rained on the 23rd and 24th, and the water in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River rose sharply. Yesterday, the various shipping companies received telegrams stating that in the shallowest Xunhan section, the Jianghai Customs can limit loading to 11 feet, which is more than one foot higher than the water level on the 21st. Therefore, the upstream route is unobstructed. Shipping companies were delighted to receive the telegrams and ordered all river ships to sail to Xunhan as usual from yesterday.

### Lawyer Zhou Yu, et al., Accused of Fraud and Dereliction of Duty

Conspiring to Establish a Retainer Agreement and Pursue Public Funds, Case Concluded by the Court Yesterday, Verdict to be Announced on the 29th

Lawyer Zhou Yu, courtesy name Xiaoci, from Yixing, Jiangsu, joined the Shanghai Bar Association as a member in March of the 12th year of the Republic (1923), with his office located at No. 214 Dahu Building, Nanjing Road. Recently, Mrs. Shen Ni, the wife of the owner of Yuanfeng Firewood Shop on Changan Road, Zhabei, through Lawyer Lu Xiangya, filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special First District Court, accusing Lawyer Zhou Yu, along with Qian Bingzhang from Yixing, a liaison officer at Lawyer Wang Peiyuan's office at No. 30 Huaxing Lane, North Zhejiang Road, and Wu Chunbo, a partner of Yuanfeng Firewood Shop, of conspiring to commit fraud and dereliction of duty by taking advantage of their official positions. The reasons for the lawsuit stated that Mrs. Shen Ni had previously engaged Lawyer Huang Yiyan to handle a case of appeal against an execution objection with Dashang Bank. Later, Qian Bingzhang, a lawyer broker, while delivering documents, promoted Lawyer Zhou Yu, claiming that Lawyer Zhou was very ethical, and introduced him to handle the case, stating that the fees would be a split of 20% of any gains. However, after Lawyer Zhou took over the case, knowing that the execution was difficult, he secretly enticed Wu Chunbo, who had previously been the legal representative of the case, and Qian Bingzhang, etc., to conspire to commit fraud. Lawyer Zhou then ordered Wu Chunbo, an employee of the shop, to sign another retainer agreement, filling in a public fee of 400 yuan. In July, Zhou wrote to the firm demanding the 400 yuan fee but was unsuccessful, so he filed a lawsuit in court. Such behavior constitutes the crimes of dereliction of duty and fraud under Articles 134 and 339 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Fu Lin presided over the trial in Criminal Court No. 8. According to the plaintiff, Mrs. Shen Ni's statement of the past events, when questioned, the defendant, Lawyer Zhou Yu, denied the charges and filed a counterclaim for false accusation. The testimonies of Qian and Wu were unfavorable to the co-defendant Zhou Yu and contained mutual accusations. Judge Fu announced the conclusion of the debate in the case and scheduled the verdict to be announced on the 29th.

### Female Corpse in Wooden Box on Yuyuan Road Determined to be Strangled

A Western Suit Tie Was Around the Neck, Forensic Examination Completed, Body Handed Over to Charitable Organization for Burial

On the afternoon of the 23rd of this month, workers from the Xinxiangji Construction Factory discovered a wooden box containing a female corpse while excavating the garden at No. 40, Lane 608, Yuyuan Road. The corpse had already undergone adipocere transformation. After reporting the discovery, the Jing'an Temple Police ordered Detective Ni Jiafeng and others to investigate and transported the body to the forensic examination center on Feilun Road to await examination. The details of the case have already been reported in the newspaper. Yesterday morning, Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, etc., arrived at the center. The examination revealed that the corpse was of a woman around thirty years old, with a Western suit tie around her neck. She was wearing a wool crepe cheongsam, with a red wool sweater and two white cotton short shirts underneath, white cotton blue striped single pants, and silk stockings. After dissection and examination by forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, it was determined that she had been strangled to death. Prosecutor Zhang then declared that the unidentified female corpse had been strangled and secretly buried before death. The body was entrusted to the Pushan Villa for burial, and the Western suit tie was handed over to the police for investigation.

### Xue Xiangjie, Wife of Real Estate Merchant, Certified by Forensic Examination to Have Never Given Birth to Children

Photos Showing Flat Abdomen Submitted as Evidence, Court Orders Conclusion of Debate, Verdict to be Announced Today

Xue Xiangjie, the wife of real estate merchant Xu Liangchen and daughter of the late dyestuff tycoon Xue Xianrun, has been married for over a decade but has never had children. Recently, Wang Yongquan, a former driver of the Xue family from Suzhou, along with his eighteen-year-old son Wang Genbao, through Lawyer Chen Wen, filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Xue Xiangjie, requesting confirmation that Genbao is Xue's illegitimate son. The case has already been heard twice by the court, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Gongdian continued the hearing in Civil Court No. 7. The defendant,

Xue Xiangjie, still did not appear.

Lawyers You E'sen and Tang Shenpei represented her in court. The plaintiff's lawyer stated first that the witness, the second landlord of Taian Lane, was in his hometown, so his son appeared in court. The court ruled that there was no need to question him. Subsequently, Lawyer You presented a defense, stating that the plaintiff's claims were completely false. According to him, Genbao was born in February of the 8th year of the Republic (1919). On the eighth day of the twelfth month of the 7th year of the Republic (1918), Xue Yansheng, the defendant's younger brother, married the daughter of Bei Runsheng. The defendant also

participated in the photo taking

and in the photo, the sister-in-law standing next to the defendant (i.e., Xue Gansheng's wife) had a large belly and was pregnant. Gansheng's wife gave birth in March of the 8th year of the Republic (1919), one month later than the defendant. Logically, the defendant's abdomen should have been even larger than her sister-in-law's. However, observing the photo, one can only see the large belly of Xue Gansheng's wife, while the defendant's abdomen is flat. How could an eight or nine-month pregnancy not be visible? Furthermore, the defendant, in order to clarify the truth, had an examination performed by court forensic doctor Wei Ligong. According to his diagnosis, he believed that

the defendant had never given birth.

This is sufficient to prove that the plaintiff's claim is unreasonable and should be dismissed. The photos and medical certificate were then submitted to the court. The plaintiff's lawyer, Chen Wen, immediately responded, stating that at the time, the defendant had not yet married. If her abdomen was bulging, how would she dare attend a grand wedding ceremony? It is reasonable to assume that a bulging abdomen can be concealed externally, so one cannot determine whether she was pregnant based solely on a photo. Furthermore, the diagnosis certificate submitted by the defendant was

signed by a court forensic doctor,

which is undeniable. However, the defendant's procedure was not legal. The defendant should have appeared in court, and the court should have sent her to the forensic doctor for examination. If the person who went for the examination was not the defendant herself but someone else impersonating her, and the defendant had no special markings, how could Dr. Wei be sure that the person who went for the examination was indeed the defendant herself? Based on these reasons, the defendant's defense is difficult to accept. The court reviewed the report and announced the conclusion of the debate, scheduling the verdict to be announced at 9:00 AM today.

### Confirmation of Paternal-Son and Maternal-Son Relationships, Each Party Sticks to Their Story

Zhang Xianlin Insists on Being the Father, Zhang Qin Chu Refuses to Be the Son

Zhang Xianlin, a 57-year-old from Hubei, resides at No. 183, South Railway Station Back Road, and works as a laborer on the railway. In the eighth month of the third year before the Republic (i.e., the first year of the Xuantong reign of the late Qing Dynasty), Zhang Antao's son died, and his widowed daughter-in-law, Zhang Wang, was only twenty years old at the time. She had an infant boy named Qin Chu. Therefore, with the help of Qi Jinxiang, he arranged for Zhang Qin Chu to marry into the family as a "filler son" (i.e., to prevent the family line from dying out). After marrying into the family, Zhang Qin Chu was able to fulfill his

duties of filling the lineage gap.

The following year, Zhang Antao died. In the 9th year of the Republic (1920), Zhang Antao's old wife, Zhang Shao, also passed away. Zhang Qin Chu also fulfilled his filial duties as a "filler son," raising his stepson Qin Chu, teaching him to study, and recommending him to the Commercial Press to learn a trade when he grew up. He is now an employee. On the ninth day of the sixth month of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), he helped Qin Chu get married. The so-called "preventing the extinction of the lineage" had already been maintained until a

time of fulfillment and maturity.

However, Zhang Xianlin and Zhang Wang are now old and weak, and they want Qin Chu to support them. Unexpectedly, Qin Chu turned against them and filed a lawsuit with the Local Court in October of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), demanding the return of Zhang family property deeds. Zhang Xianlin was furious and, together with Zhang Wang, hired Lawyer Xu Lin to sue Zhang Qin Chu in the Local Court, seeking confirmation of the paternal-son and maternal-son relationship, stating that Qin Chu was only one year old at the time and is now 30 years old, betraying 29 years of

nurturing kindness,

which is inhumane. Yesterday, Judge Yu opened the trial. Zhang Xianlin testified that he was a foreman at the South Railway Station and described the previous circumstances as mentioned above. When questioned, Zhang Qin Chu testified that he was 30 years old and lived at No. 160, South Railway Station Back Road. Zhang Xianlin and his family were only neighbors. He had an affair with my mother. After taking another man's wife, he now wants to force me to be his son. There is no such reason. There is no paternal-son relationship or obligation to support. Furthermore, my tuition fees were all paid by my maternal uncle, Wang Bingsheng. My family has

two acres of land

and a house and an ox, which were previously managed by my maternal uncle for three years and are now managed by me. It has nothing to do with the plaintiff. At this point, the plaintiff stated that his original surname was Chen. He married into the Zhang family as a "filler son" for Zhang Antao and was recognized as an adopted son. He presented evidence such as the gift list from Zhang Qin Chu's wedding, with Zhang Xianlin acting as the host, and a group photo. However, Qin Chu argued that the gift list and other items were forged and that the group photo was taken when they were playing together as children and cannot be used as evidence. One person insisted on being the father in court, while the other vehemently denied being the son. The court ordered the case to be adjourned for further questioning with witnesses.

He suffered internal injuries and was discovered by his colleagues, who rushed him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment.

### Eighteen Years of Cohabitation, Abandoned Overnight

Tan Zhaohui Marries Another, Shi Minren Files a Lawsuit

Shi Minren, a woman from Haimen, is 35 years old. In her youth, she studied at Wanzhu Primary School and was very close to Tan Zhaohui. Later, as they grew older, their love blossomed, and eventually, without the need for matchmakers, they cohabitated freely. Time passed, and eighteen years have elapsed. They have a son who is now fourteen years old. However, Tan suddenly abandoned his beloved and married Du Hengru. A wedding ceremony was officially held at the New Asia Restaurant, and an advertisement was published to announce the marriage. From then on, Shi became an abandoned woman, and her son became like an orphan, facing great difficulties and without a livelihood. Shi has now learned that Tan resides in the Delin Apartment. She has hired a lawyer and filed a criminal complaint with the First Special District Local Court against Tan, according to Article 229 of the Criminal Law, requesting an investigation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao opened the trial. The defendant, Tan Zhaohui, did not appear. His lawyer appeared in court and stated that Tan was away from Shanghai and requested a postponement. When questioned, the plaintiff, Shi Minren, testified that she and Tan cohabitated and had a son but did not marry. The court then informed her that since they had not held a wedding ceremony, her status was questionable. Shi's representative lawyer, upon hearing this, stated that although they had not bowed to heaven and earth in the past, they had bowed to the Kitchen God. The plaintiff's mother can come to court to prove this point in the future. Judge Xiao then ordered the trial to be rescheduled to the afternoon of February 3rd.

### Thirteen Robbers Who Plotted to Rob the French-Owned Water and Electricity Company Are on Trial

A pistol and a Mauser pistol were confiscated, along with

nine bullets.

They were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation. The details of the investigation have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Sun Pengxian of the Second Special Court, along with clerk Tao Zongkan, continued the trial in Criminal Court No. 1. Lawyer Gu Shouxi of the Police Department stated that the Police Department's investigation of the case was not yet complete and requested a two-week extension. After briefly questioning each of the defendants, motorist Chen Nanxing, 39 years old, from Haimen, who works as a driver at the Broadway Branch No. 6 of the Southern Motor Company, was summoned as a witness. On the morning of the 9th of this month, two people

came to hire a car

saying they were going to Lujiawan Luban Road and back and paid a fare of two yuan. The accounts room ordered me to drive. The two passengers got in the car. I drove to the intersection of Kangti Road. One passenger got out opposite the tram company, and one passenger sat in the front with me, saying, "Friend, please help me." I got out of the car, and another person came, pointing a gun at my chest, telling me to sit in the back of the car and "help." I sat in the

back of the car.

The person with the gun sat with me. I then heard them say, "The detectives are chasing us." The person in the front then drove the car to the intersection of Laoshenfu Road. They told me to get out and said the car was parked not far away, telling me to go back and drive it back. I ran to the Southern Motor Company replacement call point at the Caishi Road to call and report to the company. Later, I walked to the

Tianchu MSG

factory gate and saw the car parked there. There was no one in the car. I drove the car to the police station to report, etc. The court ordered Chen to identify whether there were any people among the defendants who had hired the car and threatened him with a gun. After reviewing the defendants, Chen replied that there were no people who had hired the car. As for the person who held the gun, he could not remember the face at the time due to fear, but he remembered that the person was very tall, wearing a coat, and had a scarf, etc. At this point, the court ordered Chen to sign a statement and adjourned the trial to 2:00 PM on February 3rd. The defendants were returned to custody.

### The Suppression of Waterfront Robbers in Nanshi Should Not Be Shirked

The Harbor Management Office and the Police Station, Orders Are Not Implemented, Disturbances Continue As Before

Xing Zhigang, the Fifth District Chief of Shanghai County, states that robbers on the ferryboats continue to run rampant, and repeated requests for suppression have been ignored. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the Harbor Management Office of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, requesting that it work with the Municipal Police Station to strictly arrest them, stating, "It is now found that the No. 18 public ferry wharf under your management, as well as the Pinghu and Yunnan wharves of the Dali Company, are the places where ferries from various towns in Pudong, Shangfeng, and Nanchuan counties arrive and dock. The number of passengers boarding and disembarking is high. Currently, groups of robbers are lurking in the areas outside these wharves. As soon as the ferry arrives, they surround the passengers and seize their belongings. Moreover, because there are many accomplices, those who try to resist are rarely spared. The police at these wharves turn a blind eye to passengers being robbed while hiring cars on the roadside, claiming that it is not their responsibility. It is heartbreaking to see them allowing robbers to surround and rob passengers. In order to ensure the safety of fellow villagers traveling, my District Chief has repeatedly written to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, ordering the Dongjiadu Police Station and the 16th Precinct to send capable detectives to pay attention to strictly arresting them at all times. Unexpectedly, orders are not implemented, and disturbances continue as before. The ferryboat and the roadside both fall within the scope of municipal authority and should not be mutually shirked to avoid harming travelers. I implore your office to work with the Dongjiadu Police Station and the 16th Precinct to send capable detectives to strictly arrest and investigate them without delay in order to maintain peace and eliminate the bandit scourge. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated."

The plaintiff, who was only fourteen years old at the time, was young and ignorant and believed them. She left Shanghai with the defendant, Liu Zaicun, Liu Sunshi, Liu Zaibin, Yang Yumei, and others on a ship, and was taken to the Xiao family residence in Fanchuan Town, Gaoyou, Jiangbei, which is the defendant's ancestral home.

### The Implementation of Hygiene Education in China (Part 1)

— Lin Jingcheng (Speaker) Yin Zhanwu (Recorder)

A lecture at the Zhenjiang Rural Nurse School Academic Conference

A. Introduction

We know that the general public in our country has always lacked basic knowledge of hygiene! This has led to the inability to practice personal hygiene, ignorance of public health, and a lack of prevention and isolation measures when infectious diseases occur, resulting in huge mortality rates! This is truly a significant loss for the people of our country! Therefore, if we want to cultivate hygienic habits in the public, enable them to obtain health security, and allow them to enjoy and utilize all the health facilities of the health authorities, we must first implement health education among the public. Implementing health education can be said to be a fundamental strategy for saving the nation and strengthening the race, in order to obtain the health of the entire nation! Therefore, it is important to know that promoting education in China does not mean simply imitating foreigners and completely transplanting foreign methods to China. The composition of Chinese society, the level of life, economic poverty, and the beliefs, religions, customs, and habits of the public are completely different from those of foreigners. Therefore, the implementation of health education in China must be tailored to local social conditions and formulate different strategies accordingly. In short, it must be able to conform to the beliefs of the public and be accepted, and even more importantly, put into practice.

B. Hygiene Education Should Advance Alongside General Education

According to the statistics of illiteracy, 80% of the people in our country do not even recognize the character "大" (big). As for the minority who can enjoy general education, they are all below the average level. Therefore, under these circumstances, we indeed feel that implementing health education is a very difficult task. This is because health education cannot be carried out independently and must advance together with general education. Health education cannot be promoted without general education, and it is also necessary to include health education as an item in general education. Otherwise, the effort will be doubled but the result will be halved, and complete effectiveness will not be achieved! Therefore, hygiene education should advance alongside general education.

C. The Relationship Between Hygiene Education and Production Education

In today's society, with the economic downturn and rural bankruptcy, it is difficult for farmers to even get a full meal. You only need to walk into the slums to see that hunger, cold, poverty, and squalor are everywhere, making you feel that the production of the Chinese people is too pitiful and there is a lack of production education! Therefore, we often see them in a state of worry when we use health services to educate them or provide them with universal benefits! The reason is that they do not reject the good intentions of health, but they have no food to eat! No clothes to wear! No house to live in! They cannot even secure food and clothing, so how can they care about hygiene? Therefore, what they hope for is that someone can help them solve the production education for filling their stomachs and keeping them warm, and the need for hygiene education is secondary. Therefore, when we implement hygiene education, we must first consider the production education of the poor.

Although some people say that hygiene education is part of production education. The reasons are: ㊀ Hygiene education can reduce excessive mortality; ㊁ Reduce the consumption during illness; ㊂ Increase production efficiency. Therefore, it can help the poor in production a lot, but in the minds of the public, solving the current livelihood is still a prerequisite. In short, regardless of whether it is a prerequisite or a subsequent decision, since hygiene education is a part of production education, we must not neglect production education if we want to implement hygiene education. The relationship between the two is indeed significant!

D. The Goal of Hygiene Education

The goals of implementing hygiene education are: ㊀ To cultivate the hygienic habits of the people; ㊁ To instill hygienic knowledge in the people; ㊂ To improve the unhealthy environment of the people; ㊃ To prevent the occurrence of diseases in the people. However, in my personal opinion, if we want to achieve the above goals during implementation, we must first break several unreasonable views of life that our people hold on a daily basis! ㊀ "Life and death are predestined"! ㊁ "Out of sight, out of mind"! ㊂ "Doctrine of inaction"; ㊃ "Love of the old from ancient times". Otherwise, it will still be difficult to promote at present, and in this way, if we can cultivate the moral concept of the people to maintain public health, then we will definitely be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort for the set goals!

E. Steps for Implementing Hygiene Education

The implementation of hygiene education should start from schools first. Its advantages are: ㊀ Because schools are organized groups, there is no problem of side support; ㊁ If there are difficult problems, teachers can guide them; ㊂ Elementary school students have very clear minds and their level of knowledge is relatively balanced, so what is taught is also easier to accept. Therefore, with these advantages, it is easier to promote; therefore, hygiene education must take schools as the center and starting point, and extend from schools to families, and then from families to society.

However, if we want to achieve results in school hygiene, we must also consider whether there is a corresponding foundation for social hygiene education, because schools and society are also related and cannot be separated from each other. Therefore, the results obtained in schools are often reduced by the friction of society and families!

### The Past and Present of Medical and Health in Haining County (Middle)

— Xia Canglin

The Prevalence and Treatment of Epidemics in the Past Decade

Epidemics in Haining can be said to occur every year. In particular, dysentery, diphtheria, and typhoid fever are found at any time. There have been two major epidemics in the past decade. One was the epidemic of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis in the nineteenth year, and the other was the cholera outbreak in the twenty-first year.

㊀ The meningitis epidemic in the nineteenth year started in Zhuqiao and spread throughout the county. As I participated in the epidemic prevention at the time, I know it in more detail. At that time, Haining set up an epidemic prevention association and established an epidemic prevention center in each of the urban areas of Zhuqiao, Fengshu Temple, Xiaoshi, and Yuanhua. Zhuqiao was the center of the epidemic area and the most severely affected, so the scale was also larger. In addition to the county government assigning me to take charge, Chen Nanping, the director of the Municipal Hospital in the provincial capital, also sent several doctors to Zhuqiao to assist. Chu Jungu, the director of the Provincial Infectious Disease Hospital, also sent personnel to Fengshu Temple to organize an isolation hospital. And Dr. Yang Zujiong of the county government had an even greater responsibility, staying up late and running around in various areas. Dr. Qian Jianchu and Yao Yongzheng of the National Health Administration, Cheng Shuzhen, the director of the Shanghai Health Testing Institute, and Luo Sai, the director of the Zhejiang Health Testing Institute, and Section Chief Xie Hanqing all came to Zhuqiao to investigate one after another. During the tense working hours, all the doctors stayed up day and night to engage in diagnosis and treatment. Each epidemic prevention center was divided into propaganda, disinfection, burial, injection, and rescue teams, which set off separately every day to carry out on-site work. As a result, in six months, about 2,000 people died (but deaths not caused by the epidemic were all included). The total number of injections was about 30,000, and the number of people who were rescued and cured was no less than 1,000. As a result of this epidemic prevention, the people of Haining gained a lot of lessons. Even the people in the countryside know more about:

1. Meningitis is a terrible infectious disease!

2. Meningitis is transmitted by contact!

3. To prevent meningitis, wear a mask!

4. To prevent meningitis, get a vaccination!

5. To treat meningitis, draw spinal fluid and inject serum!

This epidemic caused great direct and indirect losses to the countryside. The already bankrupt countryside has not been able to recover from this major epidemic.

㊁ The cholera outbreak in the twenty-first year. The drinking water in Haining County mostly relies on the city river. According to general customs, washing rice, drawing water, and washing clothes are mostly done in the same place. Therefore, stomach diseases have always been prevalent from time to time. Once there is cholera, a small spark will become a prairie fire. At that time, the local government thought that after the great epidemic in the nineteenth year, the years were barren, and the society was in a downturn and the countryside was bankrupt. There was no way to raise funds to handle epidemic prevention. Therefore, there was no way except to carry out preventive injections. Although hospitals in various places also provided free rescue within the possible range, there were many patients and it was difficult to accept them all. At that time, Dr. Zhang Jingyi raised funds from Shanghai gentry and established a temporary epidemic hospital in Xiaoshi. Although it only lasted for a few months, the number of people rescued was also quite a lot. However, the general public still believed in scrape-痧 practitioners, so the total number of deaths is still uncountable, but it is still considerable.

Opium and Flue-cured Tobacco

"There are no manufacturers of opium poison in Haining, and there are few traffickers. The most prevalent users are in Chang'an and Xiaoshi, because the land is located on the railway and the transportation is convenient for importing drugs. The rest, such as the Huangwan area, is where salt merchants gather, and the poison situation there is no less than in Chang'an and Xiaoshi. The drug used is purely opium, which is smuggled from the Suzhou and Shanghai areas. Most of those who are addicted are from the middle and lower classes. In recent years, due to the strict ban on opium, coupled with the failure of silkworm farming, the social economy has fallen into bankruptcy. Opium addicts have no ability to smoke again, and many have voluntarily quit. Many wealthy families have fled to Shanghai to avoid the law. Because of the strict prohibition implemented in recent years, coupled with arrest and forced abstinence, the poison situation in the territory has generally been cleared up"—This is a quote from the report submitted by Haining County to the Zhejiang Provincial Special Commissioner for Opium Suppression in the 24th year (see Wu Wangji's report on the suppression of opium in eight counties)—It can be seen that those who are addicted to drugs see opium as life. As long as the ban is slightly relaxed, it is inevitable that the ashes will rekindle. Therefore, although it has been declared cleared up several times, the opium prisoners in the prison are still very crowded today.

Since Haining County strictly prohibited opium once in the nineteenth year and designated hospitals in various places to handle opium abstinence, in the twenty-first year, the province issued an opium prohibition plan, organized an opium prohibition committee, and established a county opium abstinence center and a drug inspection center. The poisonous gas was slightly reduced for a while. Later, the county opium abstinence center had no funds to continue running and was suspended in January of the twenty-third year. Another designated Yuqu Tang Junqing Clinic, Xiaoshi Shengsheng Hospital, Yuanhua Kangmin Hospital, Chang'an Gospel Hospital, etc. to concurrently handle opium abstinence. Afterwards, according to the order to continue the prohibition measures, funds were raised to restore the county opium abstinence center and the opium abstinence centers in the second, third and fourth districts, and reviewing physicians were hired for review. According to Wu Wangji's report, as of January of the twenty-fourth year, six hundred and eighty-three opium addicts had been detoxified. According to the investigation in August of the twenty-third year (Wu Wangji's report), the exact number of opium addicts in Haining was 1,657. Then the number of people who have not been detoxified and are still smoking is still considerable. This year, the ban was strictly enforced again, and opium abstinence centers were re-established in the urban area and Xiaoshi area. It also designated the three hospitals of Xiaoshi Shengsheng, Fuen, and Hongkang and ordered them to register and voluntarily surrender for abstinence. However, although the method was good, the county government authorities did not handle it well, and the county magistrate was found to have abused his power and fined opium addicts who voluntarily surrendered 10,450 yuan. Someone reported this to the opium prohibition supervisor, and it was published in the daily newspaper and caused a sensation far and wide. As a result, the county magistrate was released on bail, and four people including the secretary and staff were detained in the security office. The whole case has not yet been judged, but a stain has been left on the history of opium prohibition in Haining for several years. At present, hospitals in various places dare not accept opium abstinence, and opium addicts are deeply worried that they will still be imprisoned if they voluntarily surrender. Therefore, they flee far and wide, and the progress of opium prohibition has been greatly affected.

### Talking about Cancer (4)

— Xiaozu

The clinical manifestation of cancerous tumors is a hard mass. When pressed, it feels like a stone. The external appearance of the anatomy is a hard knot. There is an uneven surface with protrusions, and the situation is not much different from ordinary tumors. Only this multi-peaked, uneven surface is used as an important evidence in clinical diagnosis. In the beginning, the whole body has no feeling, no pain and no itching. As it gradually grows, the body gradually becomes thin, the body weight drops layer by layer, the skin color changes to a dark color, yellowish and dull, and the local ulceration at the site of the cancer and the surrounding erosion, and even the organ function

failure, are of course reliable and cause suspicion. As for the definite diagnosis, the doctor cuts off a small piece from the accessible area and sends it to a pathologist for section examination, which is a definite and unchangeable method. In terms of biology, there is Klein's reaction, KlienKrebsReaKtion Klein Krebsrsktion, which can be used as a diagnostic method for the presence or absence of cancer. It is still in the trial period. The final result of cancer is Kachixee, the so-called cachexia. This is the main driver of body wasting, weight loss, and skin discoloration. As for the reason how cancer causes cachexia, physiologists have not yet given us a satisfactory answer. The reason for this, of course, must be found in metabolism.

The malignancy of cancer is demonstrated by its rapid growth, invasive ability, and transfer effect. Since its cause is still unclear and there is no good medicine for the symptoms, the only way for doctors to deal with it at this time is to cut it with a knife. There is no good method. Radium, X-rays, and biological methods (such as cell autolysins, etc.) are only partially certain. What makes doctors most difficult is the rapid transfer of his virus. Metastiade Before many cancer source areas reach the point of being unmanageable, the seeds of the virus have been transported to other places through the lymph or blood vessels, and quickly germinate and bear fruit. Therefore, before surgeons start, they must carefully examine the depth and breadth of the metastasis in order to determine whether the operation is suitable or not. Otherwise, if they engage in it blindly, it will only cause the patient to suffer and will not help. Just like suppressing bandits, it is necessary to make overall calculations, otherwise, it will be in vain to labor the people and waste money! What is even more troublesome than this is that cancer is prone to recurrence. Often, as soon as the initial disease is cut away, it soon regenerates in the same place, which really troubles the patient and causes the doctor to receive inexplicable blame. There is also one thing that is most annoying, that is, the places infected by the transfer of the virus have no symptoms at first, or are not very obvious. If the patient undergoes surgical treatment at this time, it seems that the chronic disease has suddenly recovered, but good times do not last long, and before long, the hidden root of the disease will sprout and grow again, one wave is flat, and another wave rises, which is really a common and unavoidable hatred for both the patient and the doctor! Here, we hope ten thousand times that there can be a reliable diagnostic method, like Klein's reaction, and has the universal and effective efficacy that can be applied in a hundred tests! To be the guide for clinicians is a very meritorious thing! Because not only doctors have many difficulties, but also patients, because this disease has very few feelings at the beginning, so they do not pay much attention. When ulcers or other symptoms become obvious, most of them have reached the point of being incurable. If there is such a method to test for the presence of cancer in the body, or get the opportunity for early diagnosis, wouldn't it be great?

### Eradicate Syphilis

— Sun Kejin

Syphilis first appeared in Europe around the 15th century (when Columbus discovered the American continent) and gradually spread to our country around the 16th century (when Portuguese boats docked in Guangzhou for trade). Now it has spread to the entire earth. The reason for this is unclean sexual intercourse. If a husband transmits it to his wife, it will result in death. If a mother infects her child, it will also result in weak offspring. If it is not eradicated, it will result in infertility and even national extinction. It is truly the most dangerous disease for the nation. European countries are well aware of its harm and spare no effort to eradicate syphilis. Prussia spends no more than 8 million marks a year on preventing typhoid fever, but spends 15 million marks a year on eradicating syphilis. After the European war, one-quarter of men and one-tenth of women in Hamburg suffered from syphilis. The government took measures to reduce it, and the number of cases in the first stage of syphilis is very small. This is all thanks to the 606 agent. According to Chad and Berlin, the percentage of people suffering from venereal diseases among soldiers is 5%, students 25%, merchants 16%, and waitresses 30%. In Vienna, Austria, there were many cases of venereal disease in the past, but the government is now working to eradicate it and has achieved great results. There are no statistics in our country, but a blood test conducted in a certain school in Shanghai showed that more than 30 people had a positive reaction. It can be seen that syphilis has spread like wildfire. There are hundreds of doctors in the market, with an average of five patients per clinic. There are about several thousand people suffering from venereal diseases. If it is not prevented, it will spread from home to city, from village to village, and there is a great danger of being out of control. The government and doctors should cooperate to prevent and eliminate the disease. The main points are as follows:

(1) Promote knowledge of venereal diseases, print pamphlets, and distribute them everywhere, so that every household knows about it.

(2) Set up a venereal disease exhibition, display pictures, so as to be shocking.

(3) Dispatch doctors to public places to give lectures on the course of venereal diseases and their dangers.

(4) Add a course on venereal diseases to health education in schools.

(5) Doctors should inform the public of methods for preventing venereal diseases.

(6) Patients must not arbitrarily stop treatment unless they have been completely cured by a doctor.

(7) Patients who violate the regulations and stop treatment may be reported to the Public Security Bureau for punishment.

(8) Patients who transmit venereal diseases to healthy people should be sentenced to imprisonment.

(9) Patients who seek medical treatment should truthfully report their address for investigation.

(10) Establish free venereal disease hospitals, with the goal of cure.

(11) Ban private prostitutes.

(12) Inspect public prostitutes.

(13) Men and women must obtain a health certificate from a doctor before marriage.

(14) Ban all advertisements for venereal disease drugs and require the responsibility of two or more doctors for certification. Selling drugs in newspapers is prohibited.

### From Winter Nourishment to Dental Protection

— Lin Jianxian

Most Chinese people talk about nourishment in winter. They believe that in spring, the spirit is scattered, in summer the heat is scorching, and in autumn there are threats of malaria and dysentery. Only winter offers a refreshing climate, focused spirit, strong appetite, and the body is receptive to nourishment. Moreover, food is not easily spoiled. Therefore, taking nourishment at this time is easy to accomplish and its effects are easily seen. So, those who feel physically weak seize this opportunity to consult doctors and seek medicine to replenish themselves. The types of tonics are also extremely diverse. Ginseng, bird's nest, deer antler, tiger bone glue, and turtle plastron glue are favored in traditional Chinese medicine. Cod liver oil, meat extract, milk, eggs, and malt extract are recommended by Western medicine. All these involve gathering the rare and precious from mountains, rivers, forests, and fields, and extracting the essence of animals, plants, and minerals. They are specially processed, refined, and made into pills, powders, plasters, and liquids. Some tonics nourish yin, some supplement yang, some replenish essence, and some boost qi. There are also special products that nourish the brain, lungs, spleen, and kidneys, fully advertised in newspapers and filling pharmacies. Everyone follows their beliefs and chooses what suits them, hoping for miraculous effects from tonics that mend the heavens and divine pills that bring rebirth. However, although those who take them have high expectations, disappointments are common. One often sees friends and acquaintances undergoing all kinds of tonification, yet the treatments are ineffective or even weaken them further. Upon close examination, the problem is not that the body is unsuitable for nourishment, but that the nourishment is not administered correctly. To talk about nourishment, one must first know where the deficiency lies and how to replenish it. If there is no deficiency, then nourishment is unnecessary. If there is a deficiency, then nourishment should not be delayed. Is the deficiency in our bodies limited to winter? From youth to old age, the process of metabolism continues without interruption. The cells throughout the body are constantly replacing the old with the new. The old ones leave, resulting in deficiency, and the new ones come, resulting in replenishment. Throughout the day, every movement, even the slightest breath or thought, is enough to deplete physical strength and increase deficiency. Since we are constantly in this state of deficiency, there must be a natural way to replenish it. What is this way? It is natural air, inhaled through the respiratory organs, and natural food, digested and absorbed through the digestive organs, becoming nutrients that are transported throughout the body by the blood to replenish the deficiencies in cells. The more active we are, the more deficiency there is, and the greater the amount of replenishment should be. If the amount absorbed cannot replenish the cellular deficiencies in time, that is, the new cannot make up for the loss of the old, then the cells throughout the body will gradually atrophy, the functions of various parts will decline, and the body will inevitably become weak. To maintain good health and natural lifespan, one must ensure that the amount absorbed is always greater than or equal to the amount depleted. However, this increase in the amount absorbed depends on the health of the digestive function and is not solely determined by the amount of food, the quality of food, or the need for specially made tonics. A laborer who eats leftovers has the strength to subdue half, while the son of a wealthy family struggles to bind a chicken. It is often seen that the master of a wealthy household consumes delicacies and tonics every day but remains thin, while his servants eat only leftovers but are plump, with full muscles and radiant skin. Looking at animals, ruminants eat grass and become fat. Grass is mainly fiber and lacks nourishing ingredients such as protein, fat, and starch. However, when it enters the stomach and intestines of cattle and sheep, through the miraculous process of digestion, it becomes an unparalleled tonic, transforming into all the bones, flesh, fat, fur, and skin in their bodies. The fish, meat, vegetables, rice, wheat, and other foods that we eat daily are like grass for cattle and sheep. They provide everything necessary for the human body. If we can fully absorb and utilize them, they are all natural and unparalleled tonics. If the digestive function is weak and cannot absorb and utilize food, even the most precious tonics will be of no benefit to the body. The digestion and utilization of food are related to the strength of the gastrointestinal function, but they also depend on healthy teeth. The first step of digestion is not in the stomach and intestines but in the mouth. In the mouth, food is chewed by the teeth and mixed with saliva (saliva contains enzymes that can digest grains). It becomes finely crushed, soft, and moist, reaching a semi-digested state. Then, the stomach and intestines further digest this semi-digested food through the action of various secretions and absorb it into the blood, turning it into nutrients for all the cells in the body. Food that is not digested or cannot be digested is excreted as feces. People with missing or incomplete teeth cannot chew food thoroughly and cannot obtain sufficient saliva mixture. The digestion in their stomach and intestines will be slow, and the amount absorbed will be reduced. Much of the food will be excreted before being utilized, greatly diminishing its nourishing value. Moreover, if digestion in the mouth is incomplete, the stomach and intestines must work harder. Over time, this can easily lead to abnormal function and further impede digestion. Furthermore, in people with dental diseases, the bacteria in their cavities, or the pus oozing from pyorrhea or periodontitis, mixes with food and is swallowed. This not only can be absorbed into the blood and develop into various diseases, but also can directly harm the stomach and intestines, causing various gastrointestinal diseases and hindering digestion. Therefore, to ensure healthy digestive function and full utilization of food, one must first focus on protecting their teeth. We should pay attention to oral hygiene and regularly consult a dentist for examination and guidance to prevent dental diseases. If there are dental diseases, they should be treated early to stop the progression of the disease and restore chewing function. At the same time, one should quit habits that are harmful to the stomach and intestines, such as smoking, drinking alcohol, and irregular eating. If we do this, then the digestive function will become strong, and food absorption will be smooth. Every meal will be a time for nourishment, and everything will become a nourishing tonic. There is no better way to nourish the body. In this society where life is difficult and human affairs are complicated, many people feel that their spirit and physical strength are insufficient. It is certainly appropriate to seek nourishment when the body is deficient. However, the fundamental solution lies in conserving energy and reducing desires to control the flow of depletion, and especially in making every effort to maintain the health of the natural digestive organs and increasing the absorption of natural foods to increase the source of nourishment. This ensures that the body's deficiencies are fully replenished daily, and physical strength remains abundant. If one abandons the fundamentals and seeks only the winter nourishment custom, relying on medicine and tonics, even if one benefits for a season, how can this replenish the deficiencies of the other three seasons?

### Domestic Medicinal Plants (Continued)

— Zhou Mengbai

Folk remedy: The seed's pappus is applied to wounds to stop bleeding.

Crushing fresh leaves and applying the juice to swollen sores is also effective.

(Other uses) The white down attached to the seeds can be used as a material for inkpads.

Oleander family (Apocynaceae)

Oleander (Nerium odorum Soland)

(Plant) Native to India, it can be planted everywhere. It is an evergreen shrub. The leaves are arranged in whorls of three, leathery, lanceolate, with sharply pointed tips. Terminal cymes bloom in summer and autumn, bearing light red flowers. The corona has 4-7 lobes, nearly equal in length. The capsules are cylindrical and paired.

(Constituents) The bark and roots contain Neriolin, Neriodoin Karabin (resinous substances), phenol-like crystalline substances, and small amounts of essential oil.

Messrs. Sakai and Ishikawa in Japan separately isolated a non-crystalline substance from the leaves of this plant, naming it Neriocorin and Neriocorein, respectively.

The roots also contain palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, and the crystalline substance Kanerol C30H500.

(Pharmacology) ㊀Neriocorin can enhance the contraction and relaxation functions of the frog's heart and reduce the number of heartbeats. If used in large quantities, it causes the heart to stop contracting. Its effect is very similar to that of digitalis preparations. The minimum lethal dose of this substance for subcutaneous injection in mice weighing 10 grams is approximately 0.4 milligrams. Neriocorein has a similar effect to Neriocorin, but is weaker.

If an effective dose of Neriocorin is used continuously, it can cause fatal toxic symptoms. Repeated injections of ineffective doses over a long period can produce a suitable cardiotonic effect.

Of the separated Neriodorein, Neriodorin, and Karabin components, only Neriodorein is considered to have a cardiac effect.

(Medicinal uses) The leaves and bark are cardiotonic drugs. Because they are toxic, caution should be exercised when using them.

### Hope for an Early Resolution to the Xi'an Incident

— Tianyu

According to recent reports, although the Xi'an Incident is not hopeless, hope is very slim. It is truly a heartbreaking matter. The shocking Xi'an Incident had just concluded with the safe return of Chairman Chiang to Nanjing, but for the past half-month, a suffocating atmosphere has once again enveloped the area north and south of Tongguan. In this situation where the national crisis deepens daily and enemy conspiracies emerge endlessly, if this matter is not resolved peacefully as soon as possible, the future is cause for anxiety.

What is concerning is not other aspects, but that the enemy of the nation will once again take advantage of the situation. This is not without evidence. An article about the enemy's plot to incite unrest in North China after the Shaanxi Incident was published in the weekly supplement of this newspaper, Volume 2, Number 2 (titled: The Impact of the Shaanxi Incident on North China). It is a true and accurate depiction of the situation. In that article, the most important point was: If the Shaanxi Incident had been delayed a few more days, North China would be a different place today. This is a terrifying fact! Another fact is De Wang's telegram calling for a ceasefire. At the time, Soviet newspapers explicitly pointed out that it was a conspiracy to incite the rapid division of China. De Wang's ceasefire meant loosening the constraints on the Northeastern Army, implicitly directing the chaos to concentrate in the Northwest, and then launching an attack to reap the benefits once war broke out. The article in this newspaper's weekly supplement mentioned earlier is the best annotation for this observation. Therefore, Chairman Chiang's safe return to Nanjing last time was not only a cause for celebration for Chairman Chiang's personal safety, but also a cause for celebration for the nation. Who can say that if the Shaanxi Incident had not been resolved last time, North China would not have experienced a shocking change?

Therefore, regarding the Northwest issue today, we hope even more that it can be resolved peacefully as soon as possible. The enemy's conspiracies against us take many forms. For example, they take advantage of the unrest among certain groups of us and actively, directly, and indirectly promote their disruptive actions. This is their most vicious policy. Are we going to allow this conspiring wolf to sneak into our nation's garden again? The only way to prevent this is to actively ensure that internal conflicts do not escalate. Seeking unity in peace and tightly guarding our borders is the best strategy. Regardless of one's position, today the people dare to say that everyone hopes that there will be no more internal turmoil.

When Chairman Chiang left Xi'an last time, his first action was to order the army to stop advancing. This was praised by the whole country. It is hoped that Chairman Chiang's spirit can be used to resolve the Xi'an issue for the second time. With the greatest sincerity, we wish that the Xi'an Incident can be resolved smoothly in peace!

### A Room with Sunlight

— Lu Zhi

In Baki's spring in autumn, through the magician Badachal's mouth, it is said: "Life is only a fable: dreams are only a fable. The road of life is shrouded in dark clouds, the road of dreams shines with the smile of the blue sky: the road of life is full of weeds, the road of dreams blooms with flowers..."

We live, living only to dream. Our dreams unfold with sunshine, beautiful spring, but our lives are dark, filled with the evil cries of cold nights.

Even the sun, yes, even the sun has not entered our room for many years.

I made up my mind, determined to live in a house with sunlight. This determination was carried out once. The sun kissed my eyelids from morning, gently telling stories in my ear, until I was tired of leaning on the table, when the sun gently sighed, like a loving mother, leaning on the window, saying softly: Be quiet, I'm leaving. This kind of life lasted for a month, only a month, and the sun disappeared from my room forever. My windows and doors are always gray, cold, the home of the north wind.

This time I made up my mind again and rented a room with sunlight. Although the sun stays in this room for a very short time, I finally have a room where the sun shines. I sent this news to Ping far away, telling him that I lived in such a room, and hoped that he would come and live with me, hoping that he would accompany me, in the radiance of the sun, to find our lost, past memories. Maybe we can dream—I dream too much, afraid of dreaming, but I still want to dream, to have a happy, smiling dream.

I know he will be happy. The years we leaned under the north wind's windows and doors have made our enthusiasm cold. And cold, hunger, and misfortune, these frowning things, are also connected with us, unwilling to abandon us, this pair of friends, always leaning in our room.

I regret, regret that I have read so many stories about beautiful stories, about beautiful love lives. I read so much, and Ping also read so much, we drowsily walked into the love dream blowing with the breath of spring. However, these are just dreams for us. Although many people live truly in this dream, we can only abandon this dream, and just like we helplessly abandoned the room with sunlight, we parted.

But we dreamed again, like a pair of children, or like a pair of people who have lost their memories, forgetting those pains, connecting two hearts in a distant place, connecting them in a spring dream.

I told Ping that I had a room with sunlight. I no longer think about the fact that the room with sunlight did not bring bread, and Ping's letter only said: "A house with sunlight! Yes! The sun! We need the sun! Shouldn't the sun also have our share? I'm really happy, although I haven't seen this sunny house yet, but I'm happy! I know this house also has my share, and the sunlight also has my share! Ah, I'm really happy! Spring, sunshine, love, these are all waiting for us! Aren't they? We must live in spring, in sunshine, in love!"

Reading his letter, my heart trembled a little. This child always cannot remember the broken dreams, those dark, crushing dreams that are on the road where we have lived.

Baki teaches others to dream, talking about the paradise in dreams, but do people who live on the road shrouded in dark clouds and full of weeds dream for long?

Children who are picked up cannot unite, will not unite, even if they do, misfortune will also be shrouded in their bodies. Reading Ping's letter, I remembered that after living in this room, the sun has not been seen for a long time!

### Dragon Pavilion

— You Qi

This ancient city, which once left a deep mark on history—Kaifeng—is now even more submerged, submerged.

I still remember clearly that year, sitting in a train on the Longhai Railway, when I passed through the plains of the north, what I saw was an endless expanse of withered yellow. Let the dried-up trees flee wildly, like a boat, the vast field will be a vast ocean, and the fleeing withered trees will become swaying and unstable gunwales.

Walking into the city gate, everything was as predicted, dilapidated roads, dilapidated city houses, and even the people living inside had dilapidated complexions. But, on the contrary, I fell in love with this ancient city, and at the same time, I fell in love with all the scenic spots in the ancient city.

I don't know in which book there was a record of the ancient city's "Dragon Pavilion", the deeds are no longer clearly remembered, but the name "Dragon Pavilion" is still imprinted in my mind.

In the weather of late winter, it was not very cold outside. Taking advantage of a fine sunny day, I groped around unfamiliar, walking on the road to the Dragon Pavilion. Passing through many crisscrossing streets, at the end of the straight street facing the South Gate Tower, there is a broken archway. Looking straight from the archway, the road is not very wide. What about the pavilion? It is not as simple as imagined. It stands majestically in the open field.

On both sides, there are two large ponds, generally called Erlongkeng (Two Dragon Pits). They stretch straight from the roadside to the distance, forming a large circle. The ponds are filled with stagnant water with little flow. The blue-green water is covered with thick ice. Playful children threw broken bricks and tiles onto the ice. In the center of each pond, there is a tomb revealed on the surface of the pond. Legend has it that the one on the left is "Pan Renmei" (a traitor), and the one on the right is "Yang Family Generals" (loyal patriots) of the Northern Song Dynasty. Loyalty and treachery are opposed. It is said that there are quite a few miracles. So, why did the tombs run to the center of the water? I am not very clear. The locals could not say either. However, the lonely appearance, with no tombstones or memorial services, is very likely to give people a feeling of desolation.

Climbing to the highest floor of the Dragon Pavilion, on the terrace of the "Great Hero Hall", looking forward, facing the door of the hall is the South Gate Tower. Outside the city gate, you can still vaguely see the "Fan Pagoda" which has lost its top. In the northeast corner, the famous "Iron Pagoda" is inserted into the clouds, a bit inclined, as if it is about to fall. Standing behind the hall and looking at the ruined "Man City" (Note), there are no houses. It is so desolate that one can hardly believe that it still exists. When the evening breeze brings the sound of bells under the eaves of the hall, this majestic building with "Dragon Steps" carved on it begins to be deeply surrounded by grayness.

Later, a friend told me that this Dragon Pavilion was once used by "Zhao Kuangyin" (the first emperor of the Song Dynasty). Near the South Gate, there is a river called "Rouge River", the water is always red, that is where Zhao washed his face when he fled. Later, he fled into the small alley behind the Buddha statue in the "Five Dragon Palace", lying on a small bamboo bed covered in sweat. If you ask the abbot to light a candle to explore it, there is a layer of oil on the clay statue, which is said to be sculpted based on the original expression. However, due to years of disrepair, some parts have been damaged.

Note: Man City, formerly the residence of the Manchus, was later destroyed due to war.

### Miss Mestizo

— Lin Na

Only Zhu Shi, Da Mu and I were assigned to work in the warehouse. Our daily work was to use pliers to open entire boxes of goods shipped from San Francisco, New York, London, or Tokyo, take them out piece by piece, and distribute them in several corners. Or, according to the order list from the retail department, we would pack them into several small wooden boxes, seal them with iron strips, and write the delivery address and store number in red ink on the outside. Then, the whole batch would be pushed onto the truck by the long board hanging on the back of the truck and moved away from the warehouse.

When this work was done, we enjoyed complete freedom. Sometimes we would gather around a wooden board used as a bunk to play cards, taking the money we won to

buy wine and snacks. Sometimes the second-class clerk, Zhu Shi, would first say that he didn't want to join in, he liked to hide like a beetle in a corner with dim lights, sit on a short stool, and look down at those martial arts novels describing the lives of martial arts heroes rented from the stall, or obscene little books like sex histories.

"Hey! You guys?..." Da Mu turned to me angrily.

"I don't want to either!" I shook my head honestly. I rarely participated in playing cards. "I want to sleep!"

"Go to hell, all of you!" He waved his hand angrily, and walked around the room restlessly. Suddenly, he seemed to remember something, his face glowing, whistling softly in his mouth, ran out of the warehouse door, walked around in the wide patio, paying attention to a square small window on the third floor. In this window, lived an old Mestizo witch and her daughter. He started to whistle rhythmically with his lips pursed, and then the shadow of a person reflected on the window glass flashed quickly. The window opened, a dark-skinned girl's face stretched out, her eyes wide open, and a smile on the corner of her mouth.

Da Mu danced his hands wildly with joy. His whistling stopped, and he murmured something softly in a groaning tone. He thought she had heard it, but she could only frown, open her mouth wide, indicating that she could not understand a word. There was no way, so he made gestures. She watched quietly, laughed heartily after a while, and quickly retreated into the window. In less than three minutes, the sound of the ladder creaked, a fifteen or sixteen-year-old Mestizo girl, wearing an embroidered shirt and a printed silk long skirt, dragging cloth slippers on her bare feet, jumped lightly from the ladder like a sparrow on a threshing floor, looked back at the surroundings, and quickly flew into the warehouse. Da Mu closed the door, following behind her like a male dog.

Zhu Shi couldn't read the book anymore, and I had to crawl out of the bunk.

"Let's play cards!" Da Mu grabbed Zhu Shi, shouted triumphantly, and reached into his pocket to take out twelve cards.

Zhu Shi showed an helpless look, yawning lazily, sat on my bunk, and silently started playing cards. The Mestizo girl sat silently next to Da Mu. One hand was busy playing cards, and the other hand held her wasp-like thin waist. Sometimes he would pretend to be unaware and touch her precociously developed, bulging nipples with his elbow, she would gently smile and push it away.

Zhu Shi's face turned red. He did not concentrate well on his cards, Da Mu and the Mestizo girl's obscene actions bewitched him, igniting a passionate heat in him like the erotic books on sex histories. He often secretly thought in his heart: God knows, I don't believe that no one has come here to date her! Therefore, he played the wrong card, lost, bit his teeth angrily, squinted his eyes, and even often tore the card angrily.

Da Mu cunningly took out money from his pocket to count it, and said in a mocking tone: "Let's stop, it looks like you will lose your entire fortune..."

Zhu Shi agreed, they took out a tenth of the money in the middle, and ordered me like it was my job: "Go to the grocery store to buy wine and bread..."

In this way, they sat silently drinking and gnawing on sweet bread for wine. The Mestizo girl didn't drink much, but her face was red, squinting her half-drunk eyes, laughing, louder than anyone else. Sometimes she would lift up her apron, bare her feet, and dance on the cement floor, or give an order:

"Chinese, why don't you fight now!"

Half a pound of wine, plus the bewitchment of a beautiful Mestizo woman, our warriors put down their cups and cursed each other in drunken tones, and fought. She quietly stood aside, clapping her hands, while swinging her round eyes, glancing around the warehouse, looking to see if there were any parts that she could casually hide under her apron and secretly take away.

When the happy duel between the two warriors stopped, the Mestizo girl also slipped away at some point. When checking the opened goods, it was often found that something was missing, but no one dared to say it.

Yang Binkui and Yang Zhenxiong's "Jade Kui Dragon" at Yuan Chang (1120), 11:15 AM to Noon

Opening "Liu Yi"

Peach blossoms like embroidery, willows like gold. Zhang Xu invites Liu Yi to travel. Both are talented and handsome. They are classmates and from the same hometown. They go together to enjoy the scenery and seek poetic inspiration. They stroll leisurely near the seashore. They see a shepherdess with a sorrowful look. She is shy and startled when she sees people. Her attire is different from ordinary women. A kind of elegance subtly enters the spirit. He casually asks the beautiful lady about her family background. Her graceful figure doesn't resemble a shepherdess. She lowers her sleeves shyly and speaks softly. Her delicate voice is like an oriole leaving a valley. "I am here because my father is angry. Today, I earnestly request you to deliver a message. The rhinoceros hairpin on my head can serve as proof. The large tree by the river can be taken as the entrance." As she pointed and described, there was indeed a large tree by the river's edge. He lightly knocked on it a few times. Little did he know that the hairpin was made of rhinoceros horn. In an instant, it could part the sea water. In the crystal palace and glazed throne room, he sees the crowned person on the throne. The emperor was shocked and angered. "Since it is so, how can I allow this? Marriage should not be hindered by the separation of the living and the dead." The drums beat merrily with harmonious sounds. He becomes a son-in-law in the Dragon Palace, before Dongting Lake.

Cao Xiaoying's "Jade Dragonfly"

Central and Western (1040), 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM

Opening "Zhao Yun"

Remember Zhao Zilong of Changshan from the past. He was both wise and brave, a true hero. The mediocre Yuan Shao lacked wisdom. The six mediocre grandsons' fates were sealed. The Han Dynasty declined and the world was in chaos. Rebels from all directions showed their prowess. Cao Mengde occupied Xu Du. Liu Biao was still in Xiangyang. Heroes from all over the world established their own territories. The drifting Emperor Uncle traveled east and west. The juncture of wind and cloud caused separation and reunion. Good generals and wise rulers scattered and re-encountered. Supporting the endangered lord, rescuing the dragon in distress. Who dared to fight at Dangyang? He cleverly took Guiyang and met the governor. The governor diligently held up a cup of wine with his beautiful sleeves. He righteously refused to comply. Zhou Lang also used a beauty trap. A clever plan was set in a brocade pouch. He went deep into the dragon's pool and tiger's den. The Wu ruler falsely claimed the Empress Dowager was ill. Sun Furen mistakenly believed and returned to Jiangdong. He successfully seized the lord across the Yangtze River. The Former Lord established a camp seven hundred miles long. Lu Xun used a clever strategy to burn it all. Thanks to the general, he escorted the emperor to Yong'an Palace. The emperor entrusted him with his life and held his hand. He always remembered the kindness of being recognized. The Prime Minister submitted his first memorial before going to war. He was old but still strong, acting as a vanguard. He forcefully beheaded five tiger generals of the Han family. His temples were gray but he still showed his old power and prestige. Few generals have achieved a complete body throughout history. Who can compare with his great courage? To this day, his heroic spirit penetrates the long rainbow.

Jiang Baochu's "Three Smiles"

New Sound (1380), 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM

This is called: Heroes cherish heroes everywhere. They drink heartily of fragrant wine. Suddenly, a drill instructor Hong enters. He is: He claims to have great martial arts skills. He doesn't take Lin Chong seriously. He says the exile must not have much talent. He must be mediocre. Lin Chong is: He endures his anger and lowers his head to show deference, fearing to offend the host. At that time, he was an angry whirlwind. Tell the drill instructor, a hero should cherish another hero. You must not be disrespectful. Hong Shiting was furious, wanting to suppress Lin Chong with his skills. This is precisely: A mantis trying to stop a cart harms itself.

Pretty dragonflies buzz around those pure lotus flowers. Ma Nina. Ma Nina. Her childhood has passed prettily. Only regretting that heartless men and women never return.

㊁ Ma Nina. Cries and sounds hoarse. Summer cicadas are finally chirping on the willow tips. Water hibiscus is no longer graceful and beautiful. The ground is covered with a little bit of golden osmanthus flowers. Ma Nina. Ma Nina. Her innocence is lost. Only hating that heartless man who never returns home.

### The Twentieth Century Drama Society to Publicly Perform "Sai Jinhua" Soon

Drama has reached the highest point in Shanghai. Advertisements for public performances occupy a large position in the newspaper almost every day. The Twentieth Century Drama Society is a brand-new organization in the Shanghai drama scene. Since the month before, it has been rehearsing Xia Yan's original seven-act fervent historical tragedy "Sai Jinhua." The play depicts the tragic state of national subjugation after the Eight-Nation Alliance occupied the capital, as well as the ugly behavior of the dim-witted and corrupt officials of the late Qing Dynasty who humiliated the country and flattered foreign powers. Especially in this time of national crisis, it evokes infinite emotion. It is said that the society has now rehearsed it to maturity and is scheduled to publicly perform it in a certain large theater starting this Friday. Those who love drama and are concerned about the modern national situation must pay attention to it.

### Traitors Never Have a Good Ending

The waves of smuggling have not yet subsided. In fact, some heartless and insane traitors are still secretly engaging in those activities for money.

In Xiao Zhengzhong's "Mr. Wang's Way to Make Money," unexpectedly he is also a traitor engaged in smuggling. He relied on smuggling to earn a lot of money. He took a fancy to Li Lin, so he tried every means to coerce and lure her, and finally married Li Lin.

Heaven's principles are clear. Traitors cannot escape the final judgment. Just when Xiao Zhengzhong was preparing to marry Li Lin in a lively and grand manner, the police suddenly came and arrested him because his smuggling activities had been discovered. It can be seen that traitors will not have a good ending!

### A Glimpse of Criticism on the Amateur Dramatists' Third Public Performance of "Lust Demon"

The third public performance of amateur dramatists has been held at Carlton since the day before yesterday. The first play is Tolstoy's famous work "Lust Demon." This play was adapted by Ouyang Yuqian into a Chinese-style script. Hundreds of people from the writer and news community attended. The criticisms given to this play are briefly recorded below:

I don't understand drama, and I've only seen Chinese plays three or four times, but I was moved this time. I think this cannot only be attributed to the power of the original author. The director and actors are conscientious and can be compared with my Japanese comrades without being inferior. Speaking of makeup, daring to seriously dress up as an old woman, I heard that many actors are unwilling to do so. However, in the last scene, I heard the audience laughing, which surprised me. Doing evil things and only trying to cover them up is the Chinese way of life. Not understanding repentance seems to be expected, but the gimmick added by the director, I think, is not only unnecessary, but also a failure. I don't know if this can be used as a reference? (Hu Feng)

I have nothing to say about the performance of "Lust Demon" because for laymen, it has already reached the extreme of performance. What I want to say is the meaning of the script: it makes us understand the secrets of the so-called "retribution" and "divine punishment." If we put aside the so-called fog of God, we can see that it is not God who is punishing people, but the reality of society that is eating people! (Ai Siqi)

The emotion I received was greater than what I received from watching plays before. I feel that the success of the actors, many people have reached a higher level than before, such as Zhang Manping, Wei Heling, Ying Yin and others. (Nie Gannu)

The success of "Lust Demon" assures us of the new victory of drama. (Ke)

### Jin Shan and Shi Chao in "Midnight Song"

I have nothing to say about this script and this performance. If you insist on me criticizing it, I only feel that the agriculture (the following original manuscript is difficult to identify) is not Chinese. (Xia Zhengnong) After watching "Lust Demon," it made me recognize many typical characters in the current society that I never recognized before. As for the director and acting skills, because I don't understand, I can't criticize it arbitrarily. I can only say: I seem to have watched a true story, not acting, because the characters on the stage, their actions and words, all have true feelings. (Guan Lu)

The most powerful way to expose reality is drama. "Lust Demon" not only exposes a kind of darkness in the old society, but also indicates its causes and consequences. (Liu Naifu)

Inner guilt and ethical coercion; the luck of the packaged laborers and the decline that the small landlords should have? I don't just see it as a performance of "Lust Demon." (Ni Wenzhou)

When I sat there watching, I felt that I was not watching a play, it seemed that what was being performed there was not actors, but myself. (Lin Na)

The five acts of "Lust Demon" are like five monster-revealing mirrors that completely expose a corner of the current society. (Qian Yishi)

Every actor in "Lust Demon" is successful. I especially like Wei Heling and Ying Yin. They make "Lust Demon" more exciting and vivid. (Qian Taisheng)

Touching plots, coupled with skilled performances, the audience sighed. (Jin Zeren)
