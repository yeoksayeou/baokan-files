### Enemy Forces Divide and Advance, Attempting to Seize Dachang; Our Fierce Counterattack Leaves the Enemy Unsupported

On the Highway Line, We Still Hold Chenjiazhai and Yujiazhai – The Fiercest Fighting Occurs Near Huanggang, Where the Enemy's Position Wavered – Fierce Battle North of Miaohang, Our Troops Pressing Towards Yanjiawan

(Report from the front lines received by this newspaper at 3:00 AM this morning) After being repelled by our forces, the enemy troops that advanced south along the Shanghai-Taicang Highway west of the Yunzaobang River from Huangjiazhai consolidated their positions around Huangjiazhai to Changjilouxia. They did not dare to advance before 4:00 PM yesterday. However, after 4:00 PM, the enemy reinforced their troops and completed their supplies, then launched two offensives. One route proceeded east from the line of Tanjiawanzhai and Changjilouxia, fiercely attacking our Gao Renqiaozhai. The other route proceeded south from Huangjiazhai west of the highway, fiercely attacking our Chenjiazhai and Yujiazhai. Our troops immediately engaged in a counterattack, fighting fiercely until around 8:00 PM, when the enemy, suffering heavy casualties, collapsed in disarray. Our troops still held the Chenjiazhai to Changjilouxia positions, awaiting an opportunity to advance. The enemy troops on the Gejiapailouzhai to Huanggang line west of the highway were surrounded on three sides (southeast and west) by our forces. They were exhausted and unable to advance. Therefore, at 8:00 PM, our troops, equipped with light and heavy weapons, launched a simultaneous counterattack on all three sides. Our artillery used dense fire to bombard the enemy positions. At the same time, our air force was also ordered to assist in the battle. An unprecedented fierce battle ensued. Our soldiers advanced fearlessly, fighting valiantly. The sound of gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls, and the sound of artillery boomed incessantly. After 10:00 PM, the battle became even more intense. The enemy's position in the Huanggang area showed signs of wavering and appeared to be in dire straits. Although they continued to bombard our troops with artillery fire in an attempt to suppress our advance, they ultimately failed to diminish our soldiers' courage. It is expected that the stubborn enemy in that area will be defeated without difficulty. From the Zhangjiapailou to Dingjiaqiaozhai and Chenjiaxiang line, our fortifications are extremely strong, and our troop strength is very formidable. Although the enemy continuously launched separate attacks from the south of the Yunzaobang River, hoping to disperse our forces, they were repeatedly repelled by our troops with heavy losses. In addition, on the south bank of the Yunzaobang River east of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, except for areas along the river such as Tanjiawan, Yanjiawan, and Beiyangzhai, which were infiltrated by the enemy, the rest of the line, up to Sunzhai northeast of Miaohang, was firmly held by our troops. According to our military officers, north of Dachang and south of the Yunzaobang River, from Sunzhai in the far east to Chenjiaxiang north of the river in the west, the fortifications on both flanks are solid, and the strength is formidable. It is nothing but a daydream for the enemy to attempt a central breakthrough and seize Dachang.

The main battle between the two armies had not yet ended as of last night. The enemy is concentrating the elite of Shanghai and Songhu in an attempt to make a final stand. Our side is well aware of the enemy's conspiracy and, in order to protect Jiangwan and Zhabei, must firmly hold the south bank of the Yunzaobang River. Therefore, both sides are fighting fiercely on the one hand and deploying troops and generals on the other, brewing for a future major battle. ① Around 2:00 PM yesterday, the enemy used more than 30 tanks and more than 10 aircraft to cover 6,000 infantry soldiers, who then advanced across the Fengcun Tang River. In the evening, they pushed our troops back to Gejiapailou. At 6:00 PM, our reserve forces stationed there waited for the enemy to approach and immediately formed a network of fire, launching a full-scale counterattack. By about 8:00 PM, our troops had a significant advantage, and the enemy retreated to Bashiqiaozhai. Around 10:00 PM, our troops launched a coordinated attack from Yujiazhai, Chenjiazhai, Zhaojiajiao, and Qiangmentou, simultaneously on the left, right, and front. The enemy's momentum faltered, and by midnight, they had retreated north of the Fengcun Tang River. The enemy suffered more than 500 casualties, and we destroyed two tanks. The enemy abandoned weapons, which our forces are currently collecting. ② The enemy at Yanjiawan, after lying dormant for many days, suddenly became active again at 6:30 PM last night. First, the two sides engaged in artillery battles for about two hours. Then, the enemy launched an attack with 3,000 soldiers. Our troops engaged in fierce battles along the Zhayang Road near Ziyangbang. Our troops were very strong and had already pushed the enemy close to Yanjiawan. ③ Yesterday, our troops at Dunjuesi repeatedly engaged in small-scale operations, advancing towards the enemy along Qiaotingzhai and Xiaoguangzhai. The enemy used three or four small tanks at each location to block our advance. After 8:00 PM and 9:00 PM, the artillery battles between the two sides were very intense.

### Enemy Forces Launch Four-Pronged Assault South of Yunzaobang River, Failing to Achieve Success

Stalemate Near Huanggang Lasts Over Thirty Hours, Enemy's Intentions to Expand Eastward Quite Evident

Although the enemy troops have made some progress on the south bank of the Yunzaobang River, they are encountering strong resistance everywhere. The slow pace of their advance and the heavy casualties are beyond the enemy's initial expectations. At the moment, the enemy has been blocked at Huanggang and Yujiazhai. Starting yesterday morning, enemy aircraft also carried out extensive activities, dropping hundreds of bombs on both sides of the highway south of the Yunzaobang River. According to reports from the Central News Agency's correspondents embedded with the troops at 8:30 PM, they were still circling overhead. The enemy's artillery was also firing intensely. Within an area of about four kilometers, artillery fire filled the air, and blood and flesh flew everywhere. The tragic scene is indescribable in words. Under the cover of aircraft and artillery fire, the enemy continued to attack our flank positions. However, our loyal and brave soldiers fought bloody battles, holding their original positions without retreating. The situation in each location and the battle reports received by this newspaper from the previous evening and yesterday morning are recorded below.

Four-Pronged Assaults All Fail

There were four fierce battles in the area yesterday. The most intense was near Huanggang, where the enemy and our forces have been locked in a stalemate for more than 30 hours. However, our troops have consistently held the line from Hulizhai to Shengjiazhai, strictly preventing the enemy's westward advance. At Chenjiazhai, next to the Liuhang-Dachang Highway, the enemy launched a fierce attack at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 20th). After our troops' desperate resistance, there was no change in the position until the evening. In the other two locations, on the banks of the river, the enemy launched an offensive westwards along Chenjiaxiang, Dingjiaqiaozhai, Zhangjialou, and Taoyuanbang, launching two successive assaults, which were both repelled by our troops. Another route, from Tanjiawanzhai and Huayuanzhai, attacked our Luzhai and Gao Renqiaozhai, but also failed.

Situation of the Bloody Battles from the Previous Evening to Yesterday Morning

In the battles north of Dachang, from the previous evening to 10:00 AM yesterday, the focus was still on the Yujiazhai area of Shanghai-Taicang Highway, especially the area from Gejiapailouzhai to Sujiazhai west of the highway. The enemy's goal was to use tanks to directly attack the front of Dachang along the highway and to use their main force to attack Xiaochiyuan and Sujiazhai in an attempt to break through the highway between Dachang and Nanxiang and put pressure on the rear of our forces. Therefore, after the enemy broke into Gejiapailouzhai, they gathered a large number of strong and stubborn infantry, and under the dense fire of their artillery, they launched a fierce assault on our Sujiazhai and Xiaochiyuan positions from Huanggang, using a wedge-shaped formation to aggressively attack. Our troops, realizing that this route was crucial to the success or failure of Dachang, deployed elite units, divided them into left and right flanks to encircle the enemy, and launched a joint assault with the front of Sujiazhai. An unprecedented bloody battle ensued. Until 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy launched four assaults. Our troops fought on three sides, fighting bravely and relentlessly, advancing without retreat. Therefore, the enemy's repeated assaults were met with heavy blows, and they retreated after suffering more than half of their casualties. Our side also suffered considerable losses. The enemy finally retreated to the Huanggang area after suffering heavy casualties at 8:00 AM yesterday morning, where they were surrounded by our forces on three sides. Because our forces are bound to counterattack on that line and have stationed heavy troops, the enemy rushed to build fortifications near Gejiapailouzhai. The enemy in the Huangjiazhai area along the front of the highway yesterday used 30 tanks to attack our Sujialinzhai and Yujiazhai positions in the southeast, covering a large number of enemy troops, and many enemy aircraft dropped bombs. At that time, our rear support troops were unable to catch up due to the enemy's intense firepower, and a portion of our positions was broken through. After dusk, our troops began to counterattack in different directions, fighting bloody battles all night. Three of the enemy's tanks were destroyed by our mortars, and they collapsed and retreated north of Huangjiazhai before dawn yesterday. From dawn to 10:00 AM, the enemy did not dare to attack. Our troops are still firmly defending the front lines north of Yujiazhai and Chenjiazhai along the Shanghai-Taicang Highway. Chenjiaxiang is still in the hands of our troops. The previously breached positions have also been repaired. During the day, our troops recaptured a portion of the positions north of that area, between Dunjuesi and Caijiatang.

Enemy's Intentions to Expand Eastward

The enemy's positions south of the Yunzaobang River form a wedge shape, with the base extending 4,500 meters from Qiangmentouzhai west of the highway to Zhangyuzhai east of the highway, and extending approximately 2,000 meters south from Heida Huangzhai, with Huanggang as the apex. On the highway line, they have advanced about 1,500 meters south, gathering a force of over one division. They are currently increasing their forces steadily. The main force in the Liuhang area has moved to the south of the Yunzaobang River. Yesterday, over a thousand enemy troops gathered in the forests near Changjilouxia, close to our Gao Renqiaozhai east of the highway. A regiment has reinforced Zhangyuzhai, east of the highway, along the river. Although there has been no action as of yesterday evening, the enemy's intentions to expand eastwards from the highway are very evident.

### Fierce Battle North of Miaohang

Our Troops Approach Yanjiawan

A Central News Agency correspondent embedded with the troops in Jiangwan reported at 0:30 AM on the 21st that a fierce battle broke out again at 6:30 PM last night on the front lines of Miaohang, which had been silent for three days. Approximately 4,000 enemy troops attacked from Yanjiawan along the banks of the Yunzaobang River. The enemy's artillery shattered the silence, signaling the start of the fierce battle. Our forces also returned fire with artillery, and the two sides exchanged fire for about two hours. Our main force advanced along the Zhayang Road amidst the artillery fire, and a bloody battle began near Ziyangbang. Our troops launched repeated assaults, and after several hand-to-hand combats, had approached Yanjiawan and continued to advance. At the time of the report, the fierce battle was still in progress.

### Our Troops Advance at Shixianggong Temple

Advancing 800 Meters from Zhujiazhai

A Central News Agency correspondent embedded with the troops in Guangfu reported at 12:50 PM on the 20th that the enemy intermittently shelled the area around Shixianggong Temple from the afternoon yesterday. At 7:00 PM, a fierce battle broke out at the intersection of Yangjing, Lianqi, and the Tang River. Two enemy tanks covered a regiment of troops in an attack on our Zhujiazhai-Beizhouzhai line. Although the enemy launched a fierce assault, they were repelled by our troops. A stalemate lasted for more than eight hours, with four or five attacks and retreats. Approximately 200 enemy soldiers were killed. By 7:00 AM this morning (the 20th), our troops were pursuing step by step, advancing 800 meters to the southeast and reaching the area between Wujiazhai and Duzhai. The momentum is strong, and the pursuit is still continuing.

### Our Troops Encircle and Attack the Enemy at Jiangwan

The Enemy Retreats Towards Qimei Road

A Central News Agency correspondent embedded with the troops reported at 0:30 AM on the 21st that our troops' encirclement and attack on the enemy at Sijingchang yesterday was very successful. Therefore, at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, we launched an assault on the southeast of Fudan University from the Tiyuhuilu-Jingtoulu area in a large encirclement formation. At 9:00 PM, the vanguard made contact and a fierce battle broke out. After our brave charge, 60 to 70 enemy soldiers were killed. The enemy struggled to hold on for two hours, but did not dare to linger and retreated towards Qimei Road. The other areas were very quiet. Only small skirmishes were heard from the vicinity of Chih Chee University and Guangdong Street. The sharp sounds of gunfire occasionally punctuated the distant rumbling of artillery fire, like ornaments.

### One Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Guangfu

Yesterday afternoon, an enemy aircraft was hit by our anti-aircraft fire and damaged. It landed in the southwestern part of Guangfu Town, within our troops' positions. The aircraft's components are intact, but the pilot has fled. Our forces are currently searching for and arresting the pilot.

A Central News Agency correspondent embedded with the troops in Guangfu reported at 11:30 AM on the 20th that the enemy launched an attack on us from Lao Xuzhai and Zhao Zhai near Guangfu at dawn today. Our troops calmly resisted the attack, without charging out. Then, the artillery concentrated their fire and launched over fifty shells, which hit the targets accurately, killing many enemy soldiers. The enemy, realizing they could not succeed, also retreated.

### Our Air Force Destroys Another Enemy Ammunition Depot

Numbers 631 to 636, Lane 449, Dinghai Road, Yangshupu, are the site of the Japanese-owned Yufeng Cotton Mill. Recently, the enemy military has been forced to move a large portion of the military supplies and newly arrived ammunition to the workshops of the Yufeng Cotton Mill. Additionally, a large troop of enemy soldiers were hiding inside the buildings. Our forces detected this and reported it. Last night, when our air force flew to Shanghai to assist in the battle, they dropped bombs on the location, all of which hit their targets. Six workshops were destroyed by our bombing. The sound of the explosions shook the surrounding area, and a fire broke out. The enemy suffered heavy losses and many casualties. Details to follow.

The Central News Agency reported that enemy warships in the Huangpu River conducted three disturbances last night at 11:00 PM, this morning at 0:30 AM, and again at 1:30 AM. Their anti-aircraft fire seemed sparse and weak, and their searchlights only made two or three sweeps, searching the sky. At that time, our planes were passing over western Shanghai, but did not fly to the Huangpu River and Yangshupu to drop bombs.

### Enemy Warships Open Fire on Pudong Again

Enemy Vessel Attempts to Steal Coal, Repelled by Our Forces

An enemy warship anchored at buoy number nine suddenly opened fire on our Pudong area around 8:00 AM this morning (the 20th), bombarding it fiercely. At the same time, three other enemy vessels slowly approached the Pudong New Mitsui Wharf, attempting to land and steal fuel from the coal depot there. Our defending troops detected their scheme and ignored the enemy warship's shelling, waiting quietly for the enemy vessels to approach the shore. Then, they unleashed a dense barrage of machine gun fire. The enemy, seeing that we were prepared, fled in panic, but not before more than ten of them were killed or wounded by our fire.

### Aerial Patrols Guard Against Our Night Raids

Enemy Aircraft Patrol the Skies Over Eastern Shanghai at Night

After our air force launched occasional night raids on Shanghai, the enemy's base of operations in eastern Shanghai suffered significant losses. Therefore, starting the night before last, the enemy has been dispatching two squadrons of six aircraft each night to fly back and forth over eastern Shanghai, as a precaution to guard against our night raids.

### 6,000 More Enemy Reinforcements Arrive

Three More Divisions Will Continue to Reinforce Shanghai

In order to divert international attention and restore national prestige, the Japanese side plans to seize the non-garrison areas within the Shanghai Armistice Agreement area before the opening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference on the 30th of this month. Therefore, they have additionally mobilized troops of three or more divisions, totaling approximately 50,000, from the Ministry of the Army to Shanghai to participate in the war. It is rumored that this batch of reinforcements will arrive in Shanghai on the 26th.

At dawn yesterday, a total of seven enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships arrived in Shanghai and docked at the Wusong Town Ferry Wharf. Three were fully loaded with war horses and military equipment, and four were fully loaded with approximately 5,000 enemy soldiers. They were immediately unloaded and disembarked, and then transported to the front in batches by approximately fifty enemy military trucks. According to investigations, the enemy troops that arrived were the second batch of the sixth reinforcement army. Furthermore, at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, another enemy transport ship, No. 331, the "Wakasa Maru," arrived with a large batch of bombs (wrapped in straw bags) and unloaded them at the Osaka Wharf.

### Another Enemy Aircraft Carrier Arrives

Temporary Airfield Being Built in Baotaishan

Confirmed reports state that, in addition to the many cruisers and gunboats, there was originally only one enemy aircraft carrier stationed at the Wusongkou Sanxia waters. On the morning of the 18th of this month, another enemy aircraft carrier arrived. Therefore, the number of enemy aircraft carriers currently anchored at Wusong has increased to two. In addition, the enemy has built a temporary airfield near Baotaishan in Wusong. According to someone from Wusong who came to Shanghai yesterday, they witnessed over twenty enemy aircraft parked near the Wusong Fisheries School, and three other enemy aircraft taking off from there.

### Enemy Repeatedly Accuses Us of Using Poison Gas, With No Factual Basis

Spokesperson for the Ministry of Military Affairs Issues Solemn Statement: We Will Never Use Illegal Means in the War of Resistance

[Nanjing] Recently, the enemy has repeatedly claimed in Shanghai that our troops are using poison gas. On the evening of the 18th of this month, they issued a public statement to foreign journalists, making the same false and fabricated allegations. According to the spokesperson for our Ministry of Military Affairs, the enemy's despicable trick has long been spurned by knowledgeable people around the world. When the enemy claimed last week that they had obtained our poison gas bombs and their mechanisms, foreign journalists immediately asked if neutral technicians had been allowed to be present during the chemical experiments. The enemy was unable to answer. That same day, when the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was questioned by a Reuters reporter, he also admitted that there were no facts sufficient to prove that Japanese troops had been subjected to poison gas. This shows that the enemy's arbitrary propaganda has no basis in fact. The repeated dissemination of this information is a prelude to the renewed use of poison gas against us. We hereby solemnly declare that our troops will never use illegal means in the war of resistance. If the enemy claims again that their officers and soldiers have been subjected to poison gas, we will ask them, as we have done, to have a formal doctor from a third country provide proof. Otherwise, any further slanderous rumors published by the enemy will be considered completely fabricated and require no further explanation. (Central News Agency report, 20th)

### Enemy Aircraft Bombarded Everywhere Yesterday

Zhabei, Pudong, Southwestern Shanghai, and the Old City - Many Homes Destroyed and Set Ablaze

Yesterday, enemy aircraft continued to fly over Zhabei, Pudong, Zhenru, Dachang, and other places, bombing all day long. The details are as follows:

Zhabei

Starting at 10:00 AM yesterday, three enemy bombers flew over Xinmin Road and Datong Road in Zhabei, dropping three bombs in the Xinmin Road area, destroying over twenty homes. They then flew over the Chang'an Road and Nanchang Road area, dropping nine bombs, and dropping seven or eight incendiary bombs in the Wuzhen Road and Guangfu Road area. The bombs ignited fires, and the burning was quite intense. At 11:30 AM, the aircraft flew east again, dropping two bombs near the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road. Homes in that area were hit by the bombs and caught fire, and the burning was also intense. Starting at 1:00 PM in the afternoon, three more enemy aircraft flew over the areas of Menggu Road, Datong Road, and the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road, continuing to bomb. Three locations were bombed and caught fire. Then, the enemy aircraft flew over the North Railway Station, dropping two incendiary bombs on the office building of the Two-Roads Management Bureau. Because the building was constructed of reinforced concrete, only the top floor caught fire and burned for about several tens of minutes. The rest of the building suffered no damage.

Dachang

Starting at 6:00 AM yesterday, several enemy aircraft continuously bombarded Baziqiao, Dachang, Zhenru, and the surrounding areas all day long, dropping no fewer than one hundred bombs in total, with the most being dropped on Dachang. However, because the enemy aircraft's targeting was inaccurate, except for dozens of bombs that hit our homes and were destroyed, the rest fell in the open fields, causing no loss to our military.

Pudong

In Pudong, four enemy aircraft flew low over Zhangjiabang at 8:00 AM yesterday, strafing the area with machine guns several times. At around 11:00 AM, three more enemy heavy bombers circled several times over Pudong, dropping six bombs near Yangjiadu. At around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, three more enemy aircraft dropped bombs in the Datangqiao area. Starting at 4:30 PM, another enemy aircraft circled over Laninidu, dropping another six or seven bombs, destroying over ten homes, and finally left in the evening.

Western Shanghai

In addition, in the Hongqiao Town of Western Shanghai, enemy aircraft dropped six bombs at noon yesterday, injuring over ten people. Enemy aircraft also flew to the Old City of Shanghai yesterday morning, but did not drop any bombs.

### U.S. Navy Memorial Day, U.S. Ships Hold Commemoration

The 27th of this month is U.S. Navy Memorial Day. The U.S. ships anchored in the Huangpu River will hold a commemorative ceremony in Shanghai at that time.

### Enemy Movements

Large Quantities of Military Supplies Stored in Hongkou; Kawashima Yoshiko Arrives in Shanghai to Engage in Activities

▲ According to confirmed reports, Hongkou Zhabu Road Honganji Temple (Japanese Buddhist temple) is one of the enemy's important military installations. An underground tunnel has been excavated under the main hall of the temple, storing large quantities of military supplies. Three hundred artillerymen are stationed there, with two heavy artillery emplacements and two anti-aircraft guns and two anti-aircraft machine guns on the roof. In addition, the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company on Seward Road also has artillery emplacements.

▲ In the Pingliang Road area of Eastern Shanghai, from Huaxing Road to the end of Pingliang Road, the enemy has planted many landmines at the intersections of the various small roads bordering the Chinese concessions.

▲ The Japanese Women's Elementary School on Hongkou Shigaota Road has been used by the enemy as the headquarters of the Hongkou District since the 11th of this month.

▲ Recently, the enemy has transported a large number of bamboo ladders and wooden rafts made of wooden boards, which are stacked at the Jun Gong Road and the waterfront of the golf course for landing purposes.

▲ Enemy Navy Commander Hasegawa convened a meeting at the Japanese Club on Hongkou Bong Road on the morning of the 17th, attended by approximately twenty people, including Harada, Okawa, Uchi-o, Tamatsu Naga, and military commanders. The topics discussed included: ① the location of troop concentration for this campaign; ② the defense against our air raids; and ③ plans to actively occupy Dachang.

▲ Shimizu, Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in China, left Shanghai and returned to Japan on the 13th of this month. Before his departure, he contacted the consuls of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France before proceeding. It is believed that Shimizu's mission in returning to Japan is mainly to establish a neutral zone in Shanghai.

▲ Yesterday morning around 7:30 AM, Kawashima Mamu, accompanied by Counselor Shimizu, traveled from his residence on Judong Road by car to Hongkou to meet with enemy military commanders Hasegawa, Matsui, Masaki, and others to listen to reports on the front lines and discuss diplomatic issues. He did not return to his residence in the French Concession via the Garden Bridge until 8:50 AM.

▲ The enemy Kwantung Army recently dispatched international spy Kawashima Yoshiko and several Chinese and Japanese women to Shanghai to engage in activities. It is now known that they have established an intelligence agency in a certain location to probe Soviet intelligence. The person in charge is Vonsiatsky, an important member of the White Russian Fascist movement, who has several White Russians working under him in Shanghai.

▲ The enemy has been actively counterattacking in recent days, attempting to occupy the area that they once occupied on January 28th within this month. However, they have been met with heavy resistance from our troops, and their casualties have been unprecedented. The eleven military hospitals in the Shanghai East District are all full, and as a last resort, they have been forced to bring in Red Cross ships to transport the wounded back to their home country for treatment. At around 2:00 PM this afternoon, another merchant ship-turned-Red Cross ship, the "Asu Maru," arrived, loading approximately sixty wounded enemy generals and soldiers for transport back to Japan.

▲ The enemy flagship "Izumo" suddenly sailed to Wusong at 9:10 AM yesterday morning and sailed back at 6:25 PM, still anchored at buoy number two across from the Gonghexing Wharf.

### China's Path to Democracy

— Song Qingling

Yesterday morning at 7:13 AM, Madam Sun Yat-sen, Song Qingling, delivered a broadcast speech at the American-owned R.C.A. radio station in Shanghai. The speech, entitled "China's Path to Democracy," was broadcast to various locations in the United States. It is said that tens of millions of radio listeners in the United States were able to directly receive this broadcast. The text of the speech is recorded below:

I am truly delighted to have this opportunity to speak to the American people about the pressing issues in the hearts of us Chinese.

I spent my youth in the United States and was imbued with the great democratic traditions of America, which has become one of the great forces in my life. Its culture has become a part of the education I received. This is very precious for my motherland, which desperately needs the spirit of democracy. Therefore, when I speak to the country where I resided in my youth, I do not feel like I am contacting you as a stranger. Instead, I know that my appeal will surely be understood and responded to by you, just as America has always generously shown in its attitude towards China.

China has launched a war of resistance against an inhuman aggressor that cannot be described in words. The Japanese militarists, who dream of realizing the fascist dream of aggression, are inflicting death and destruction on our land. Who can not be shocked by the news of the terrible suffering encountered by the Chinese people? Who can not vow to wipe out these heinous criminals after witnessing the barbaric act of ruthlessly bombing innocent women and children? It is clear that the massacre of non-combatants in our cities is not necessary for military targets. Then, can one maintain a passive attitude towards this public enemy, which not only threatens China but also threatens the civilization of the whole world? The so-called enlightened Prime Minister of Japan, Fumimaro Konoe, even said, "Japan's only way is to lash China, to make it kneel, to make it no longer have the spirit of fighting." These cruel words further unleashed the bloodthirsty Japanese military.

Other Japanese diplomats are more cunning and less frank. They sophistically argue that all they ask is that China should fully understand their proposed "cooperation" proposal. In return for their kindness, China only needs to reshape our history according to their wishes. Anti-Japanese sentiment should be completely eliminated from our lives and textbooks. Their barbaric behavior should be interpreted by us as sacred deeds of obeying fate. I can only let the people of the world think about how absurd this is. Even in Japan, this defensive propaganda contains a threat to the United States itself. At the same time, any country that feels that the Chinese people are suffering endless pain from Japan's atrocities should also consider it a threat. The almost unanimous agitation of British, American, and other people shows the universal condemnation of these barbaric humans by the whole world. The spontaneous anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States cannot but attract the solemn attention of the Japanese militarists, resenting your lack of cooperation. Although the current threat from Japan is only applied to China, who can guarantee that at some point, such a strange attitude will not harm its own people in action?

For decades, Japanese imperialism has been constantly invading China and seizing our land. Not to mention the distant past, in the recent six years, the aggression of Japanese imperialism has now developed into an attack on North China and Shanghai, and has reached the final moment of China's life and death. The whole world can still remember the occupation of the three northeastern provinces, the Shanghai War of 1932, and the means by which Japanese imperialism gradually entered Jehol, Chahar, and northern Hebei through conspiracies and massacres. The United States called on the world's powers to hold the Washington Conference to make Japan accept the treaty respecting China's territorial and administrative integrity and the open-door policy. However, the signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty shrinkingly sat and watched these treaties being torn up by Japan, one of the signatory countries, and did not try to stop the crazy adventure of the Japanese militarists to conquer China. The Tanaka Memorial, which is regarded as the bible by every Japanese militarist, is the established plan of Japan to conquer all of Asia, which is placed before all treaties. Do we still need to remind the people of the world of this point?

Why is China poor and weak, and why is Japan able to run rampant in Chinese territory? This question is difficult to explain clearly in a few words. To put it briefly, China's weakness and powerlessness in the past ten years has been due to internal friction and mutual slaughter. From 1923 to 1927, under the leadership of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the great national revolutionary movement that spread throughout the country united the country and became the beginning of a great united nation. The old warlords were overthrown one by one. Under the instructions of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, China had embarked on the road to completing a strong and democratic country. However, the death of Mr. Sun caused great misfortune to the Chinese nation. His legacy and the Three Principles of the People disappeared in the years of civil war. The result of mutual slaughter was the destruction of the country, and the lives of the masses of people fell into poverty. Therefore, Japan was able to seize our four northeastern provinces and continue to invade our land. Our internal division only allowed Japan to reap the benefits.

In mid-July, Japan continued to send large armies to North China. It also attempted to seize another large piece of our territory, while targeting the Yangtze River basin as its second goal, stationing a large number of troops in Shanghai, attempting to occupy Shanghai and its surrounding areas in order to promote further aggression. But it failed. The Chinese people, with their brave determination and flesh and blood, resisted the aggressor's giant ships, cannons, airplanes, and mechanized troops. The enemy's bombing destroyed our cities, schools, libraries, and other cultural institutions. The enemy arbitrarily massacred our women and children, making every Chinese commoner feel the madness and irrationality of Japan. No matter how crazy the Japanese militarists are, no matter how powerful the Japanese militarists are, I dare to tell you firmly on behalf of all the Chinese people that the Japanese militarists will surely meet their demise on our territory. All Chinese people are prepared to defend their motherland with the ultimate sacrifice. The indignation of all our people is more than enough to compensate for the difference in military equipment.

In the past three weeks, the power of the anti-Japanese movement has greatly increased. In recent years, our workers, farmers, and intellectuals have joined together in salvation groups to organize a national war of resistance. At the same time, national consciousness has also materialized along with this movement. We have realized that the great Chinese nation is an indivisible whole, enough to shatter any conspiracy of Japan. When the Japanese army attacked us and enemy planes indiscriminately bombed our innocent civilians, all parties, factions, and groups in the country forgot all past disputes and united to form a strong front to launch a sacred national liberation war. The civil war had long ended. All internal friction had been eliminated. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek and General Zhu De, who were at odds with each other, also reconciled in Nanjing. This new offensive of Japanese imperialism has become a catalyst for combining all the resources and forces of China to resist the violent enemy. The former Red Army, now the Eighth Route Army, is a part of the national army and is joining the war. It won an overwhelming victory in its first contact with the enemy. Our national unity has generated great power, as strong as a fortress, giving the invaders a head-on blow.

If necessary, we will naturally resist the fascist aggressors of Japan with our own strength. But we have heard the voices of sympathy from all over the world. Therefore, we are fortunate that we are not isolated during our suffering. The condemnation of the Japanese executioners' atrocities by the whole world has given much comfort to our suffering compatriots. I firmly believe that the United States will express sincere sympathy for our country's struggle for freedom and independence. We know that we are not fighting alone. We know that we are launching a war against these fascist thugs not only for ourselves, but also for all those who still love freedom and democracy. You hate these fascist demons and spontaneously want to boycott all Japanese goods. This is what we urgently need. Please do not let any ship leave the United States for Japan, because Japan can transform any of your products to deal with us. Monetary assistance is certainly important for our war, but more importantly, please continuously transport military arms and ammunition to replenish our army. We must have a strong army to resist a strong enemy. I hope that the voice and efforts of the fair American public opinion will reach the whole world. The United States does not need to participate in the war to destroy this fascist threat in the Far East. President Roosevelt's moving speech succinctly stated that the whole world morally condemns the atrocities of this international rogue. Please unanimously support President Roosevelt's speech, so that his words can be put into action, and extinguish the cruel flames before they spread to all countries in the world. I ask the American people to rise up and lead this holy crusade. I firmly believe that you will not disappoint us.

### Enemy Retreats North on the Jinpu Line

Fierce battle between our forces and the enemy south of Pingyuan; enemy routed between Shijiazhuang and Baoding; our right flank in northern Shanxi under heavy enemy attack

[Beijing] According to news from foreign sources in Jinan today, the Japanese army is currently retreating from northern Shandong. Han Fuju's troops have advanced rapidly towards Dezhou from the Tuhai River, with little resistance from the Japanese army. Foreign sources indicate that this development is due to political reasons. Other sources say it is due to the active guerrilla forces in Hebei province, so the Japanese army has to shorten its communication lines in the Jinpu Railway area. At the same time, the Japanese army that entered northern Henan has temporarily stopped advancing and is waiting for reinforcements to attack the Chinese army's positions north of Zhangde. (Central News Agency, 20th, Reuters)

[Jinan] Military News: 1. Our guerrilla forces have now seized Dongguang; 2. More than 1,000 enemies entrenched in Pingyuan and Lijizhai, ten miles south of Pingyuan, are under siege and fierce attack by our army; 3. A squadron of our aircraft bombed Lijizhai and Pingyuan this afternoon at 3:00 PM, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy; 4. Our aircraft safely passed over Jinan and returned to defense at 4:00 PM. The public saw our aircraft for the first time and were extremely excited. (20th, Special Dispatch)

[Jinan] Today, the enemy in Pingyuan attacked south and engaged in fierce fighting with our army on the north bank of the Tuhai River. The fighting stopped at 8:00 PM. Today, four enemy planes dropped eight bombs on Yanzhou, damaging one arch of the Sihe stone bridge. They bombed one shed car in Sunshidian. Five more planes reconnoitered Yucheng and Yancheng, and one plane reconnoitered Sangzidian. (20th, Special Dispatch)

[Nanjing] The capital has just received a telegram from the Shandong provincial authorities stating that after our army crossed the Tuhai River and launched an attack to the north, the enemy retreated in disarray. A certain division of our army on the Jinpu Railway front has now advanced to the area north of Luanzhuang and north and west of Jimingdian, and is engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy. Pingyuan will soon be recovered. On the right flank, a certain unit of our army has now advanced to the area north of Lingxian and Shanghe. A certain guerrilla unit has even recovered Ningjin in Hebei province. On the left flank, a certain guerrilla unit, in addition to recovering Gaotang, northwest of Yucheng, on the 18th, is also actively advancing. The Jinpu Railway defense line is now as solid as a rock, and the enemy will certainly not be able to cross the Lei Pond. (20th, Central News Agency) [Nanjing] A squadron of our air force, in order to assist the army in attacking on the Jinpu Railway line, flew to the Pingyuan area at 2:00 PM on the 20th to bomb the enemy's supplies and military engineering works. When our aircraft flew over Pingyuan Railway Station, a large number of enemy troops were concentrated at the station, and several armored vehicles were parked there. When the enemy troops saw our aircraft flying over, they fled in panic. Our aircraft calmly dropped dozens of bombs on the station and armored vehicles. The station immediately caught fire, and the armored vehicles exploded at the same time. Our air force completed its mission and returned to defense together. (20th, Central News Agency)

[Nanjing] Relevant sources: Our army captured Dezhou on the Jinpu Railway on the 20th. The enemy retreated north from Dezhou. (20th, Special Dispatch)

[Kaifeng] The enemy between Shijiazhuang and Baoding has been routed. Small groups of plainclothes troops that have been harassing Handan and Cixian are being surrounded and eliminated by our forces. Therefore, the sound of artillery can be heard in Zhangde. Passenger trains are temporarily operating to Baoliansi. (20th, Special Dispatch)

[Kaifeng] A regiment of the enemy that crossed the Zhang River was completely eliminated by our forces on the 20th, and an enemy armored vehicle was seized. (20th, Special Dispatch)

[Taiyuan] On the morning of the 19th, the enemy launched a fierce attack on a certain army on our right flank. The fighting was most intense from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. Later, after our fresh troops joined the counterattack, they finally repelled the enemy, and we still firmly defended our original position. By the afternoon, the fighting gradually eased. In the central area, because the enemy and we were fighting for high ground, both sides suffered heavy casualties. On the left flank, the enemy released smoke bombs, seemingly transferring troops from the rear to other places. (20th, Central News Agency)

[Taiyuan] On the afternoon of the 19th, the enemy in Yongxing Village (about thirty miles northwest of Xinkou) sent more than forty people to reconnoiter and guard Zhaowuzhuang. More than ten people were wounded by our forces. At 1:00 PM, the enemy reinforced more than 200 people to retrieve their wounded soldiers and launched an attack on our guard position. They were repelled by our forces. (20th, Central News Agency)

[Taiyuan] On the evening of the 16th, a certain detachment of our army divided its forces to attack Hanjiafang Village, Chenjiabao, Daiyue Town, and Yulin Village in Huairen. They immediately blew up the iron bridge in Chenjiabao. Now the traffic between Yanmen and Datong has been destroyed by us, and the enemy's transportation is difficult and the rear support has been cut off. (20th, Central News Agency)

[Taiyuan] The enemy attacking Niangziguan from Jiuguan has always been surrounded by our forces. The enemy's two regiments have been annihilated by us for days, with about more than 2,000 casualties. Our army also suffered heavy casualties. (20th, Central News Agency)

### 24 Enemy Aircraft Destroyed in Northern Shanxi

[Nanjing] The news that our army raided the enemy's temporary air force base in Yangmingbao in northern Shanxi and destroyed 24 enemy aircraft has also been reported by relevant sources here and has been confirmed. (20th, Central News Agency) [Taiyuan] In order to eliminate the enemy's aircraft arbitrarily strafing our non-combatants, our army has made up its mind to destroy its aircraft warehouse in northern Shanxi. A certain regiment of Liu's division was sent to Yangmingbao enemy airport for reconnaissance (Yangmingbao is north of Guoxian and south of Daixian, and is a temporary base for the enemy's air force invading our Shanxi Province), hiding around and watching for opportunities for many days. At first, only a few enemy aircraft were found taking off and landing. Regiment Commander Chen Xishi and Deputy Regiment Commander Wang Naigui personally concealed themselves and watched again a few days ago. On the evening of the 18th, they saw a total of 24 enemy aircraft landing. Regiment Commander Chen saw that the opportunity had come and immediately began to deploy. One battalion was deployed to Guoxian, one battalion was deployed north of Yangmingbao and Daixian to block the enemy's reinforcements on both flanks, and one battalion was determined to die bravely. At 1:00 AM on the 20th, they broke into the airport. Hundreds of hand grenades were fired simultaneously, and the sound of explosions was endless. All 24 enemy aircraft were blown up and caught fire. The enemy's guards, about a battalion or so, moved out upon hearing the alarm and began a melee with our army in the dark night at the airport for more than an hour. The enemy's reinforcements from Yangmingbao also arrived, and more than ten armored vehicles escorted the battle. The battalion saw that the mission had been accomplished and began to leave safely. In this battle, our side suffered more than 100 casualties, and only more than 20 wounded soldiers were rescued. The rest all made heroic sacrifices. There was also one battalion commander, two company commanders, and five platoon leaders seriously injured. The enemy's casualties were several times more than ours. Also, a small artillery team of a certain brigade of our army shot down two enemy aircraft in the front on the afternoon of the 18th, both of which crashed near Lingshan. (20th, Central News Agency)

[Taiyuan] Although enemy aircraft still came to disturb Pingxing on the 20th, only one or two aircraft came each time, without dropping bombs. This may be because our army destroyed 24 of its aircraft, and the enemy's transportation was also destroyed, so there was a shortage of aircraft and ammunition. (20th, Central News Agency)

### Enemy Deploys Puppet Troops for Guerrilla Warfare

[Taiyuan] People from the front said that the enemy is recently afraid of the divine power of our army's guerrilla warfare and wants to imitate it by disguising puppet troops as farmers, with towels or blue cloth wrapped around their heads, and appearing near our positions. Our army has noticed this situation and has stepped up its attention to prevention. However, their guerrilla warfare lacks training and has little effect. The enemy's army originally used puppet troops as the vanguard, but recently they have changed to deploying puppet troops for reconnaissance, disturbance, and other tasks, while their regular army acts as the vanguard. (20th, Central News Agency)

### Many Low-Ranking Enemy Officers are Tired of War

[Taiyuan] In recent days, our army has won many victories and captured many low-ranking enemy officers and soldiers. Diaries and letters were found, in which the records and correspondence mostly expressed disgust for the war. A certain company commander wrote in his diary, "Heavy casualties have been suffered in continuous battles. I have witnessed several comrades being shattered by artillery fire. My conscience has discovered that the psychological aversion to war can no longer be supported," etc. This proves that the few Japanese militarists who launched the war of aggression against China are not only deeply hated by their people, but also that their low-ranking officers are also tired of war, and their collapse must not be far away. (20th, Central News Agency)

### Enemy Planes Attack Nanjing Twice

Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bombed Again; Jiangxi Shoots Down Two Enemy Planes

[Nanjing] Nine enemy heavy bombers and five fighter planes advanced towards Nanjing along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway at 12:30 PM on the 20th. Our air force, upon receiving the report, immediately intercepted them. When the enemy planes reached the vicinity of Changzhou, they suddenly turned towards Jiangbei and detoured to attack Nanjing. Around 1:00 PM, nine enemy bombers were discovered in the suburbs of Nanjing. Our anti-aircraft guns and artillery fired fiercely at them. The enemy planes panicked and dropped more than twenty bombs near the airfield. Three of them flew high and sped across the sky above Nanjing. At that time, the city's anti-aircraft guns and artillery densely and simultaneously fired. The enemy planes hurriedly flew towards the northwest. It is reported that, apart from some office buildings inside the airfield being destroyed by the bombing, there were no other losses. At 2:30 PM, six enemy planes flew to the Danyang and Changzhou areas to drop bombs, then appeared to be advancing towards Nanjing. Our air force immediately flew to intercept them. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the enemy planes hastily fled. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 20th)

[Nanjing] In the attack at 12:30 PM, there were a total of nine heavy bombers, escorted by four fighter planes. They dropped about twenty-four large bombs outside the South Gate. Because they were flying very high, the anti-aircraft guns were unable to hit them. The enemy planes did not bomb Pukou. Only three bombers flew towards the Wutai Mountain area. Due to the intense anti-aircraft fire, they dropped their bombs and immediately fled. At 3:40 PM, the alarm sounded again, indicating that four enemy planes were advancing towards Nanjing, but they did not reach Nanjing and instead dropped bombs in Danyang and Changzhou. Subsequently, several civilian ships were sunk in the river near Changzhou. Today, six enemy planes dropped large bombs outside the South Gate in succession. A Reuters reporter believed that the airfield and arsenal there must have suffered heavy damage. However, after the second all-clear signal, he went to inspect the two places and found that the arsenal was still busy with work as usual, and the airfield had fifty large craters, which were being quickly filled by workers. (Reuters dispatch from the 20th, via Central News Agency)

[Nanjing] This afternoon, enemy planes attacked Nanjing again. There were at least six bombers and four fighter planes. At 12:40 PM, heavy bombers flew in from the east and bombed the airfield from an altitude of 10,000 feet, shaking the entire city. The anti-aircraft guns immediately fired fiercely. The enemy planes then flew north to attack Pukou. At the same time, three more bombers flew in from the west and bombed the airfield and arsenal outside the South Gate again. Four fighter planes flew in a circle from north to south to protect the bombers. After the enemy planes flew away from Nanjing, an explosion was heard from the southeast, probably near Banqiao. The all-clear signal was given at 1:30 PM. (Reuters dispatch from the 20th, via Central News Agency)

### U.S. to Take Strong Measures Besides Mediation at Nine-Power Treaty Conference

U.S. President States No Prior Commitments with Other Countries; Davis Talks with Roosevelt at Length Before Leaving for Belgium; Originator of Kellogg-Briand Pact Condemns Japan for Abandoning Faith

[Washington] The State Department today, together with representatives attending the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, jointly studied the Nine-Power Treaty and various diplomatic documents to determine what rights should be enjoyed by countries that declare their adherence to the treaty. They also indicated that they had considered steps that were more forceful than mediation regarding the Sino-Japanese War. It is said that while the conference can take any appropriate measures, it is unlikely that there will be any more severe actions other than the imposition of sanctions by the countries concerned. Diplomatic circles believe that based on the recent attitudes of countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands, there still seems to be a tendency towards mediation and compromise. (National Telegram, 19th)

[New York] Davis, the chief U.S. representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, is scheduled to lead the delegation on the "Washington" liner to Belgium tomorrow. President Roosevelt recently made a statement on this matter to answer the opposition, stating, "Regarding Mr. Davis' trip, the U.S. government has not made any promises to other relevant countries." The New York Times also commented, saying, "Although President Roosevelt has made this statement, we still believe that the head of state must have a plan in mind to effectively punish 'international lawlessness.' This plan is not military in nature, and the United States will not be drawn into a vortex of war as a result. As for its content, President Roosevelt remains tight-lipped." (Havas dispatch from the 19th, via Central News Agency)

⊙Hyde Park, New York President Roosevelt met with Davis, the chief U.S. representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, for a long time today. Afterward, the President stated that before Mr. Davis' attendance at this conference, the U.S. government had absolutely no tacit understanding with any other government. The invitation to the conference stated that "countries will examine the situation in the Far East and study peaceful methods to shorten the scourge of war." (National Telegram, 19th)

⊙St. Paul, USA Kellogg, Secretary of State during President Coolidge's administration from 1925 to 1929, and the originator of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, stated here today, "Japan's aggression against China is completely inconsistent with the spirit and text of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. I still believe that the hope for world peace depends entirely on signatory countries adhering to the principles of the treaty. Any country that violates the treaty is abandoning faith and creating international anarchy. Therefore, countries that respect international obligations should seriously consider steps to make the treaty effective." (National Telegram, 19th)

[New York] After a long talk with Davis, the U.S. representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, President Roosevelt declared today that the U.S.' participation in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference does not bind it to any other government. This statement is seen as a response to Republican Senator Johnson, who gave a speech in San Francisco today, asking Davis not to depart for Belgium until the U.S. and Britain had previously agreed on some kind of plan. President Roosevelt also said that the purpose of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is for all countries to find a way to resolve the Sino-Japanese problem by agreed methods. We aim to cooperate with other signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, including China and Japan. The U.S. delegation is scheduled to depart for Belgium on the "Washington" on Wednesday. (Reuters dispatch from the 19th, via Central News Agency)

[Rome] Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the German and Italian governments are currently in negotiations. Italy's acceptance of participation in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is almost completely certain. Therefore, what Germany and Italy are discussing is not related to whether Italy will participate in the conference. It is mainly about what attitude the Italian representative should take. (Havas dispatch from the 20th, via Central News Agency)

⊙Brussels The Portuguese government recently accepted Belgium's invitation and decided to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. To date, seven countries have accepted participation in this conference: China, Britain, France, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Portugal. In addition, Italy is said to have decided to participate. (Havas dispatch from the 19th, via Central News Agency)

### Japan Can Only Be Self-Sufficient in Copper for Military Supplies

Iron, Lead, Zinc, and Aluminum All Depend on Foreign Supply

[Washington] According to a report released today by the National Resources Committee, of the main raw materials needed by Japan for its war in China, only copper can be fully produced domestically. Other basic war materials such as iron, lead, zinc, and aluminum all need to be imported in large quantities. Based on a survey from 1932, Japan produced a total of 76,000 metric tons of copper, with consumption being only 75,000 metric tons. Other minerals: ⑴ Iron: Japan must import from various countries. Domestic iron production in Japan is only 1,200,000 metric tons, while consumption reaches 1,600,000 metric tons. Of the 400,000 metric tons of iron imported by Japan, about 300,000 metric tons come from China and about 100,000 metric tons from India. ⑵ Lead: Japan's dependence on foreign supply is even greater. Domestic lead production in Japan is only 4,000 metric tons, while consumption reaches 61,000 metric tons. The 57,000 metric tons imported is mostly supplied by the U.S. and Canada, followed by Australia and Mexico. ⑶ Zinc: Japan only produces 10,000 metric tons, while consumption reaches 50,000 metric tons. The shortfall is mostly supplied by Canada and Australia. ⑷ Aluminum: Japan consumes 8,000 metric tons, which is entirely supplied by Europe, Canada, and the U.S. Therefore, if various countries implement economic sanctions against Japan, it will definitely be effective.

### U.S. Opposition Party Criticizes Roosevelt

Landon and Johnson Give Speeches, Saying the President's Policies Are Quite Dangerous

⊙Topeka, USA Landon, the Republican presidential candidate in the last presidential election, gave a radio speech today, launching an extremely fierce attack on President Roosevelt's foreign and domestic policies. He said, "The Roosevelt of today is completely different from the Roosevelt of 1932 during the election. What is most concerning is that the power we have given him has reached a concerning level. For example, in foreign affairs, President Roosevelt's actions, if not cautious, risk drawing the U.S. into a vortex of war. In short, the President's impulsive, arbitrary, and dictatorial attitude will encounter a greater crisis internationally than domestically. For example, Congress has adopted a neutrality policy, but the President has rejected this principle of neutrality with his personal will. Under this situation, the U.S. Congress should decide whether it will completely rely on the President's whims or still adhere to its original policies." Landon then asked 170 million voters to unite to protect the Republic, because the President's actions today have violated the provisions and spirit of the Constitution, so he requested Congress to withdraw the broad powers it has given to the President, so that the President can be guided by experienced people. Landon pointed out that the President's plan to reorganize the Supreme Court was an attempt to expand his personal power, and he also believed that the various other bills proposed by the President were reckless and impractical, and did not help the actual situation, so there was no talk of recovery, and unemployment was still a problem. (National Telegram, 19th)

[San Francisco] Republican Senator Johnson issued a formal statement today, arguing that the U.S. should stay out of the Far Eastern crisis and avoid any entanglement with the League of Nations. Johnson asked Americans to pay attention to the various actions and propaganda that led the U.S. to participate in the last World War, so as to avoid repeating past mistakes. Japan's actions in China are undoubtedly outrageous, leading to sympathy for China and hatred for Japan, but this kind of emotion is enough to lead people into a vortex of war, which we should guard against. Finally, Johnson asked Americans not to forget the failure of Stimson's warning to Japan in 1918 and the cold shoulder he received from the British. He meant that if the U.S. does not take this failure as a lesson, it will repeat Stimson's mistakes. (National Telegram, 19th)

### New York Stock Market in Chaos

Sharp Decline and Huge Trading Volume; President Does Not Intend to Intervene

[New York] The market prices of various U.S. securities have fallen sharply, from one dollar to thirteen dollars and still falling. As a result, a great disturbance has occurred in the securities market, which is only seen after the great chaos of 1929. Speculators are dumping in large quantities, making brokers unable to cope. The market is full of shouts and noises. Business people calling to demand margin calls continue throughout the night. The sale of whole blocks of shares has reached from thousands to twenty-five thousand shares, and notices sent by telegram from all over the country are flying in like snowflakes. The total number of securities traded throughout the day has reached 7.29 million shares. Fortunately, large investment companies purchased in large quantities in the afternoon, which slightly stopped the collapse. As a result, prices rose to six points, and the number of drops also reached five points. According to news from Hyde Park, President Roosevelt is unwilling to discuss the sharp fall in New York securities, and is unwilling to exercise the President's prerogative to declare the securities market closed. (Reuters dispatch from the 19th, via Central News Agency)

[New York] In recent weeks, the stock market here has been very chaotic, and the prices of various securities have fallen significantly. After the market opened today, the decline was even sharper. Within an hour, the number of securities traded reached more than two million shares. However, by the time the market closed, the prices of various major securities had rebounded. The stocks of various railway companies, public utilities companies, and government bonds remained strong. In total, the number of shares traded throughout the day reached 7.5 million, which is the highest amount since 1933. Financial circles believe that the current general economic situation in the United States is still good, so they do not know the reason for the continued decline in the prices of various securities. Well-informed sources also do not believe that the continued decline in the prices of various securities in recent days is a harbinger of a future financial panic, as in 1929. The current government is closely watching the situation in the stock market, but the Federal Reserve Board does not seem likely to intervene for the time being. In addition, Representative Sabath, a Democrat from Chicago, recently sent a telegram to President Roosevelt, saying that the recent decline in the stock market was caused by speculation and manipulation by the banking industry, and requested the President to take immediate and severe measures to stop it, even if it means implementing currency inflation, so as not to follow the path of the 1929 financial panic.

### The Non-Intervention Committee Meeting: The Spanish Issue Becomes Deadlocked Again

Italian and Russian Representatives Reject French Proposal; British Government Decides to Make a Final Rescue Attempt

[London] This morning, London is making a final effort to salvage the breakdown of the Non-Intervention Committee. It is believed here that although the committee reached a deadlock last night, it is not entirely hopeless to avoid a breakdown at the meeting this afternoon. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 20th)

[London] Well-informed sources recently stated that the issue of withdrawing foreign volunteers from Spain will continue to be discussed within the Adjustment Committee on Non-Intervention Measures for a considerable period. When the committee continues its meeting this afternoon, the British and French governments may declare their acceptance of the Italian proposal, using the compromise proposal put forward by the United Kingdom on July 14 as the basis for discussion. However, there is one condition: the issue of withdrawing volunteers should be resolved as soon as possible. The reason for the concessions made by Britain and France to Italy is, firstly, to show sincerity, and secondly, to force Germany and Italy to adopt a definite stance. (Havas News Agency, Central News Agency, 20th)

[London] The subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee on Non-Intervention Measures in the Spanish Civil War held a meeting this afternoon to continue discussing the withdrawal of volunteers from various countries. British Foreign Secretary Eden personally chaired the meeting and submitted the proposal made by the French representative at the last meeting for discussion. After three hours, there was still no hope of reaching a compromise. The subcommittee then decided to postpone the meeting until 3:30 p.m. tomorrow. However, it is generally believed that a better result may not be obtained at that time. At today's meeting, Italian representative Grandi spoke first, strongly stating that the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War must re-submit the compromise proposal put forward by the British government on July 15 for discussion, and said that the Italian government had submitted a reply to this proposal. When Grandi spoke, Chairman Eden repeatedly interjected, asking him to pay attention to the facts of the discussion and not to involve procedural issues, and said that the proposal put forward by the French representative was actually based on the British compromise proposal, and the two cases were actually two in one. French representative Corbin said that the French proposal was sent to the governments of the countries concerned on the 16th, and the representatives of the countries should be asked to express their opinions without involving other issues. Portuguese representative Monteiro then spoke, describing in detail the evolution of the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, and said that the first to intervene in the Spanish Civil War was actually the Soviet Union, and that the current situation was becoming increasingly serious. The Nyon Agreement was actually detrimental to the Spanish National Army. The best solution now is for all countries to recognize the National Army government as a belligerent group. In conclusion, he said that if France could restore the land border surveillance measures, Portugal would also be prepared to do the same. Chairman Eden, considering that what the Portuguese representative said was inconsistent with the purpose of the meeting, replied that the subcommittee was meeting today to invite representatives from various countries to express their opinions on the French proposal. Please pay attention. At this point, representatives from Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden successively expressed their acceptance of this proposal. However, German representative Wallmann still insisted on re-discussing the British compromise proposal first. Soviet representative Maisky then spoke, saying that although the Soviet government did not refuse to discuss French construction, "this proposal is actually equivalent to continuing to promote the so-called non-intervention policy. There is no guarantee of how to make it more effective, and it does not stipulate effective measures for monitoring violations of the non-intervention agreement. Therefore, if the French proposal is accepted, it will only cause the representatives of the countries on the Adjustment Committee to continue to talk endlessly in the future, while certain countries that supply the Spanish National Army with weapons and volunteers can still continue to do so. The Soviet government cannot be responsible for the consequences that this situation may cause." Maisky then stated that the Soviet Union has always supported the complete withdrawal of volunteers from various countries in Spain. It is proposed that foreign volunteers belonging to both sides of the Spanish Civil War should immediately withdraw in large numbers in proportion to the total amount. Two, implement surveillance measures, but only on the condition of restoring maritime surveillance measures. After Maisky's speech, the subcommittee adjourned for a moment. After resuming, Chairman Eden summarized the opinions of the representatives of various countries, stating that the Soviet Union advocated that the belligerent groups in the country should be recognized only after all volunteers from various countries within the Spanish borders have withdrawn. The Italian representative argued that the opinions of the groups advocating prior recognition of belligerent groups were extremely contradictory, which was already undeniable. However, if the subcommittee is declared to be adjourned indefinitely because of this, it would "not only be unfair, but also not help the situation. It is decided to continue the meeting tomorrow afternoon in order to strive to find a compromise." (Havas News Agency)

### Coming and Going in the Bombing

— Guo Moruo

Twelve

The capital on the 25th was particularly clear. Early in the morning, people were saying that enemy planes might attack today. Sure enough, around nine o'clock, just as I was about to take a car east to visit Mr. Wang, a housemate said that the air raid alarm had sounded. -- In my half-deaf ears, I really didn't hear anything.

Before long, there was another tense and urgent air raid alarm, so my housemates all ran to the trenches at the foot of the mountain to take refuge. They were all very concerned about me, calling me to sit in the deepest part. The trench was dug into the mountain, and there were no air vents except for the entrance. Sitting in the trench for a while, my feet felt like they were being gnawed by rats, so I moved closer to the entrance. The anti-aircraft guns were booming.

Ji Xing and Mingde had gone to the newspaper office. Ji Xing had a brother named Youhai who was still in high school. This lively young man, wearing a set of yellow canvas Zhongshan uniform and a pair of black, inverted lamb-horn-like speakers, stood on the steps of the entrance, watching the situation in the sky and reporting to the people in the trench one by one. One person in the trench said to me: Youhai is our sentry.

"He's very interesting, let me be a sentry for you too!" I said, and I simply stood on the steps.

"Mr. Guo, come down, it's dangerous," said the people in the trench.

"Mr. Guo, go down, it's dangerous," said Youhai outside the trench.

"Give me that speaker," I finally listened to them, only asking Youhai for his pair of inverted lamb horns.

Youhai put the speakers on me. The sound was to be heard louder.

The duel between the anti-aircraft guns and the enemy planes was really spectacular.

As far as I could see, there were initially eleven enemy planes flying over, turning from the south to the east of the city to prepare to disperse. The anti-aircraft guns hidden everywhere roared to the sky at times, and the gun smoke pierced through the enemy planes' formation. The smoke and clouds were closely connected with the shadows of the planes, making it difficult to distinguish clearly.

Suddenly, there was an especially solid cannon sound, and the tenth plane in the enemy formation, carrying a plume of black smoke, fell like a comet.

"Well done, really well done! An enemy plane has been shot down," Youhai reported to the trench with great joy.

After one enemy plane was hit, the others scattered, and after the anti-aircraft gun smoke competed with them for a while, they each fled.

The music in the sky took a break. Youhai and I simply left the trench and sat on the mound to watch. There was not a single pedestrian on the street except for the guarding soldiers. Needless to say, all means of transportation had long disappeared.

The silent street, the sea of silence, but in the silent road, there was a surging tide of willpower.

Before long, another squadron of enemy planes came. This time there were fifteen, still coming from the south, but turning to the northwest of the city to disperse. The anti-aircraft gun smoke competed with them even more closely. Suddenly, there was another especially solid cannon sound, and one of the enemy planes emitted a red light, and black smoke rose from the red light, like a comet, and fell.

Well done, really well done! Another enemy plane has been shot down! Youhai jumped up, reporting to the trench with even greater joy than before.

Why does it emit red light? I asked suspiciously.

"That must be because the fuel tank was hit," Youhai said to me very knowledgeably.

The enemy plane that was shot down fell in the northwest area of the city and also started a fire.

The other enemy planes flew around in a panic for a while, and then fled.

For a good while, the sky and the earth were still and silent, without any sound.

"It's really delightful. I came to Nanjing and saw our aerial battle with my own eyes, and I saw our anti-aircraft guns shoot down two enemy planes with my own eyes. It's really delightful," I said to Youhai with great emotion.

"It's not easy for anti-aircraft guns to hit planes. I saw it with my own eyes for the first time today."

"Why don't we see our planes coming?"

"Our planes are fighting the enemy outside the city, blocking the enemy planes. If the enemy planes break into the airspace of the city, we use anti-aircraft guns to shoot them down. Fighting in the airspace of the city, causing stray bullets to fly around, is quite dangerous for the citizens."

Youhai seemed to understand the process of the battle very well. Whether it was true or not, I don't know. Anyway, it was a casual conversation between young people, so I'll just record it here.

The air raid alarm lasted especially long, and the sun pressed on my head a little painfully, teasing me a little unbearably.

"I see that the alarm is about to be lifted. Let's go back," I urged Youhai.

"Okay, it's probably going to be lifted soon."

Youhai accompanied me back to the entrance, and he said: "Oh, you have foresight, the alarm has been lifted."

He heard the whistle of the all-clear alarm, but I still didn't hear anything.

Before long, the people in the trench also came back, and everyone was smiling happily.

Then, there was a phone call from Mingde of the Xinmin Newspaper Office, and the news reported in this phone call added even more joy to everyone's joy.

It is said that in this enemy plane attack, our planes blocked it outside the city for a long time, and only a part of it broke into the airspace of the city.

It is also said that our anti-aircraft guns hit three planes in a row at Pukou with one cannon. How did they hit them in a row? It was because one cannon hit the enemy plane's bomb, the bomb exploded, and it itself injured two planes, and they fell down together.

One cannon hitting three planes will probably become a saying in the future. This is more modern and memorable than the old "killing two birds with one stone".

The enemy declared that it would turn Nanjing into ashes.

But I saw with my own eyes that the enemy turned into ashes in Nanjing.

### The Enemy's First Military Wavering

— Jin Zhonghua

It has only been two and a half months since the enemy launched a large-scale invasion against us. However, because the war is not progressing smoothly as planned, the first symbol of military wavering has now appeared. The most obvious manifestation of this symbol is that the five general offensives in Shanghai have failed to achieve the expected results. As a result, many parties within the enemy's country immediately raised "criticisms," believing that such a large-scale invasion entailed too much sacrifice and was not worth the cost. Naturally, under the enemy's strict wartime news censorship, the news of this internal wavering cannot be clearly revealed; however, the symbol of this wavering has been unintentionally displayed in the enemy's official news propaganda.

At 3:00 p.m. on the 17th of this month, Tokyo Radio broadcast an interview with a certain naval officer by a special correspondent from the Domei News Agency. In the question-and-answer session, there were the following two passages:

'Question: What is the recent situation on the Shanghai front?

'Answer: There is no change. The Japanese army is still carrying out operations according to the established plan with the cooperation of the army, navy, and air force. Recently, I have heard that some people in the country are criticizing the military operations for not being able to unfold quickly. To be honest, it is difficult to progress quickly in the Shanghai battle due to the limitations of the terrain........

'Question: What about the war in the South?

'Answer: The strategy for the war in the South is mainly bombing. The naval blockade is also very difficult. It can be said that the soldiers are suffering more than the actual situation.'

These two passages are really worth savoring. The most noteworthy points are the following three: ㊀ It is now definitely proven that some people in Japan are criticizing the military progress for not being able to be swift. ㊁ Japanese military authorities have 'honestly admitted' that it is 'by no means easy' to progress swiftly. ㊂ The 'hardship' of the Japanese soldiers in combat has proven the difficulties and pains they have been experiencing, which outsiders cannot imagine.

Two and a half months of invasion, and the enemy has already exposed its first military wavering; therefore, it is only natural that various wavering and uneasy growths will occur in a long-term war of aggression. To be honest, it is truly unimaginable the pain the people of a country with a weak economic foundation like Japan will feel, and the crisis it will contain in the future if it ventures to engage in a prolonged and arduous war. This point also proves that we are confident about the prospects for our long-term resistance.

We also know that the Japanese imperialist military preparations were originally based on "quick victory." Therefore, at the beginning of this large-scale invasion against us by the enemy army, Konoe had repeatedly stated to his own people that he wanted to quickly end this war. Later, when the enemy army launched general offensives against Shanghai time and time again, the military commanders always set deadlines to break through our first line of defense. However, the enemy's expectations repeatedly failed. In desperation, Konoe and Sugiyama had no choice but to announce that this war would be a long-term war, with no hope of ending within 1937. At the same time, in the talks that the Japanese rulers gave to their citizens, they did not conceal the seriousness of this adventurous invasion for the future of Japanese imperialism. At times, they even exaggerated excessively, enticing the oppressed masses of Japan to endure sacrifices and support this war of aggression.

On the 15th of this month, when members of the Japanese Provisional Cabinet Council, Machida, Maeda, Akita, Anbo, Suetsugu, Matsuoka, and 　垣, met with reporters, General Suetsugu, the former commander of the Third Fleet, said: "The current situation is more significant and serious than the Russo-Japanese War. If Japan does not strive to carry out its desired objectives and achieve perfect results, the future will be very dangerous." (According to Tokyo Radio broadcast at 3:00 p.m. on the 15th.) The so-called "very dangerous future" is precisely the honest words of the Japanese imperialist rulers. Two and a half months of all-out war have given the aggressors the first serious warning. The aggressors are already wavering! They have already imagined the tragedy for the future of Japanese imperialism after their invasion of China hits a wall!

However, even though we say this, we know that the Japanese imperialist warlords will never have any regrets. They believe that in order to carry out the purpose of aggression and "harvest perfect results," they can avoid the dangers of the future. Therefore, their tragic cries are intended to beg for the loyalty of the Japanese working masses, not to rise up in revolution, so that their aggression can painfully sustain itself.

At present, when the Japanese imperialist aggression mechanism has encountered its first setback, we know that this wavering will not immediately lead to its collapse. But we believe that as long as we resolutely resist, the exposure of internal wavering phenomena, one after another, will be the death knell of Japanese imperialism, one by one. In the end, its collapse is inevitable.

### Enemy Looting of Steel Stored in Hongkou Worth More Than 4 Million Yuan

Heavy Losses of Hardware Materials; Enemy Warships Transporting to Japan for Days

The steel stored by the hardware stores in Hongkou, which could not be shipped out after the outbreak of the war and was looted by the enemy and loaded to Japan, is of great value. Only steel plates, iron bars, and other items have been verified by various merchants, calculated according to the purchase price at the time, worth 4.6 million yuan. If calculated according to the current market price, it is more than this amount.

### Ende Wheel Alters Course to Tongzhou

The China-Italy Shipping Company, for the convenience of Shanghai refugees going to Ningbo and other places north of the Yangtze River, has already dispatched the Ende Wheel, which sails the Shanghai-Ningbo line. Over 100,000 refugees have benefited from its service, being carried to Ningbo Zhenhai. Now that the weather is getting colder, there are still many refugees from Shanghai north of the Yangtze River who urgently need to be transported back to their hometowns. The company has decided to add another ship, the Deping, which will sail to Ningbo, replacing the Ende, which will be rerouted to the new Tongzhou line. The service is scheduled to start next week. The Italian Consul in Shanghai has notified the Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy to take note that Italian ships entering and leaving Wusong shall not be obstructed or inspected by Japanese warships.

### Central Government Key Personnel Send Telegrams of Condolence to Vice President Kong

It was a grand occasion, and the guests and hosts parted in high spirits.

### Zoo's Wild Animals to Be Housed in Safe Zone

In Case of Enemy Bombing Damage, Escape of Wild Animals Would Be Extremely Dangerous

The Shanghai Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road in the Nanshi district, although not very large, is well-arranged and houses many rare and exotic animals. Therefore, it usually attracts many visitors, and the ticket revenue is sufficient to cover its expenses. A stray bullet recently hit the roof of the zoo's office building, reportedly an unexploded anti-aircraft shell, causing no damage. However, the zoo's director, Shen Xiangrui, is deeply concerned that enemy bombing, which is indiscriminate, could damage the enclosures of the zoo's wild animals such as lions, tigers, leopards, and bears. If these animals were to escape, the harm to nearby residents would be unimaginable. Therefore, he consulted with the Zhaofeng Park Zoo and obtained their agreement to temporarily house the zoo's wild animals there. Because the Zhaofeng Park Zoo is quite large and relatively safe, however, that zoo only has sturdy enclosures for bears, and has no other vacant land for housing the animals. The Municipal Zoo has therefore requested an appropriation from the remaining funds in its ticket revenue to build temporary enclosures for the animals to be housed. These temporary enclosures can be moved in the future. The request has been approved by the Municipal Government and work has already begun to hire craftsmen to rush construction. The estimated cost is over six thousand yuan.

### Donations of First-Aid Kits from Other Places

Wartime Soldiers Need First-Aid Kits; Recent Donations from Other Places Are Very Enthusiastic

Wartime soldiers need first-aid kits. Recent donations from other places have been very enthusiastic. For example, the colleagues of the Wuxi branch of the Shanghai Bank remitted 54 yuan and 6 jiao to the Shanghai branch yesterday, entrusting them to purchase 546 first-aid kits from the China-West Drugstore. In addition, Fang Yunxiang and He Xingrong of the Xinyuan Renji Clothing Store in Tinglin, Songjiang, collected 73 yuan from various sectors of society, and also entrusted the China-West Drugstore to purchase 730 first-aid kits. The drugstore has already remitted these kits to the慰勞委員會 (Comfort Committee) for transportation to the front lines for use. It is reported that 600,000 of these first-aid kits are needed, and it is hoped that donations will continue to be made enthusiastically.

### Enemy Shamelessly Appoints Puppet Baoshan County Magistrate

Traitor Wu Lansheng Appointed Secretary-General

After our Baoshan county town was occupied by the enemy, a small number of traitors organized a puppet local maintenance association to serve the enemy's purposes. According to news from relevant sources, the enemy still believes that the puppet maintenance association is not reliable enough, and the military department has appointed a Japanese person named Yoshida as the puppet county magistrate, and Wu Lansheng, an opium-addicted traitor who served as the former head of the maintenance association, as the puppet secretary-general. They have actually cobbled together a shameful puppet government. The enemy is shameless and unparalleled in the world.

### The Front Lines Urgently Need Transportation

Relates to the Shanghai Battle Situation, Eagerly Awaiting Donations

In recent days, the battle at the front lines is in full contact, which is crucial to the overall situation in Shanghai. All support from the rear cannot be neglected in the slightest. However, there is a severe lack of trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, and telephones used to communicate military information, which is greatly affecting strategy. It is urgently hoped that our people will share the enemy's hatred and jointly shoulder the responsibility to enthusiastically donate or temporarily supply the above-mentioned urgently needed transportation tools. The more, the better. Please send them to No. 1197 Lafayette Road to be collected and transferred by the Transportation Committee for distribution and use, so as to benefit military needs. This is what is hoped for.

### Intensify the Organization of the People

— Appropriate

In the midst of a war against foreign aggression, a strict organization of the people is absolutely necessary. This goes without saying.

The 保甲 (baojia) system established by local governments and the mass organizations led by the Party seem to be enthusiastically advancing their work for the sake of resisting the war. However, many of the fighting troops in various places are still complaining that they are not receiving effective assistance from the people. In some places, there are even traitors everywhere, wantonly causing trouble. Why is this?

Obviously, the peacetime organization of the people was not sound enough, so now, despite the efforts to advance the work, it is still unable to deeply penetrate the people and meet the needs during the war of resistance. Responsible governments and party departments in various places, if they do not want to fail the country, must painfully and thoroughly review and overcome the weaknesses exposed in this aspect of work at any time. In particular, they must abandon all factionalism and absorb as many talented and progressive young people as possible. Let them take on the work of organizing the people during the war.

We believe that the vast majority of our compatriots have a full awareness of resisting the enemy. As long as lively and capable organizers reorganize them strictly, they can unleash a very strong force.

### Chairman Jiang Commends Donations of Cotton Vests

Wuhu is the Starting and Ending Point, Anqing Station Does Not Land

According to Shanghai Post Office news, the Beijing-Hankou route operated by China National Aviation Corporation has now resumed flights. Flights operate in opposite directions every Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. However, the eastern end is temporarily using Wuhu as the starting and ending point.

However, the postal plane is under repair and cannot fly for the time being.

### Rice Price Reduced by Four 角 (jiao)

Grain Transit Tax Has Been Waived, Rice Price Restored to Original Limit

The Shanghai Citizens' Food Regulation Committee previously stated that the Ministry of Finance was collecting local transit taxes, and rice and grain were also included in the local products. Therefore, it was requested that the collection of transit tax on rice be exempted to maintain people's food supply. At the same time, it was announced that before approval was obtained, various types of rice and grain would be increased by 4 jiao per dan. Now that the Ministry of Finance has ordered the Jianghai Customs to allow the exemption of transit tax on all rice, grains, and wheat from the 18th of this month, it is hereby announced to all rice sellers in this city that the price of all types of rice and grain sold will be reduced by 4 jiao from today. The highest price for white粳 (japonica rice) should still not exceed 14 yuan, and the medium grades should be reduced accordingly.

### Yan Xishan Replies to the Federation of Trade Unions by Telegram

### Cotton Textile Workers of the Tenth District Donate Funds to Console Soldiers

Xieshunxiang Hengji Donates Cotton Clothes to Refugees

The City’s 10th District Cotton Textile Industry Trade Union, following a notice from the Federation of Trade Unions to donate funds to console soldiers resisting the enemy, immediately convened workers from the Shenxin No. 8 Factory to discuss the matter. As a result, they have raised a donation of 1,495 yuan, 2 jiao and 9 fen. It has been designated that 500 yuan will be used to console the soldiers in North China, 500 yuan to console the soldiers fighting in the淞滬 (Songhu) area, and the remaining 495 yuan, 2 jiao and 9 fen will be used for refugee relief. The funds have been transferred to the Shanghai Local Association for separate allocation. The enthusiasm of the workers of these two factories is commendable, and it is hoped that workers in other industries will unite and donate to increase the strength of the resistance against the enemy.

The City’s International Relief Committee, yesterday received 500 sets of newly made cotton-padded jackets and trousers from Mr. Hengji of Xieshunxianghao on Caishi Street, in view of the cold weather, and delivered them to the committee to distribute to refugees in the shelters. His enthusiasm and generosity are admirable. However, it is heard that the shelters of the committee are built with reed mats, which are colder than other shelters, and the number of refugees is quite large, so the supply of cotton clothes is far from sufficient, and the need for cotton quilts is even greater. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will donate more and send them to the committee on the third floor of the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge.

### Chamber of Commerce Certifies Goods May Not Carry Enemy Goods

The above-mentioned certificate has now been approved by the commander of the ×××× Command Headquarters and all affiliated troops have been ordered to facilitate its passage. However, the goods transported by each business should be carefully examined and should not carry enemy goods or contraband. In order to be cautious, the association has printed a standard format for requesting the issuance of cargo transportation certificates, which should be filled out in accordance with the format and submitted to the association for verification when members request it. This measure will be implemented from the 22nd of this month, and we hope you will pay attention to it."

### Zhu Shi'en Establishes Refugee Hospital

Well-known figure Zhu Shi'en is usually benevolent and enthusiastic about relief matters. Mr. Zhu believes that the enemy's re-invasion of Shanghai this time can only be survived by a long-term war of resistance, and rear relief is particularly important. All citizens should do their best. He has established the Shi'en Refugee Hospital at No. 456 Jiujiang Road in this city. Refugees and wounded soldiers, whether hospitalized or outpatients, will not be charged for medical treatment. The day before yesterday, his son, Mei Su, and Miss Zhi Cheng, the daughter of Mr. An Weimo, held a wedding ceremony at the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge, with Mr. Fang Jiaobo as the officiant.

The fire engine was dispatched twice, both in Yangshupu. The fire was quite fierce and lasted for a long time before it was extinguished.

### Zhang Deyi Relocates Clinic

Zhang Deyi and his wife, of the Qianyi Orthopedic Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society, are nearly sixty years old but still tirelessly serve the community. Since the start of the Shanghai battle, their original residence has been relocated due to the war to No. 696, Xuanyi Temple, at the intersection of Avenue Haig and Rue Cardinal Foch, telephone number 30601. They continue to provide medical services, both medicine and treatment. Those injured by the enemy's aggression and injured refugees are all given their utmost effort to help. Recently, it has been heard that there are still many people with fractures who dare not seek medical treatment because they are afraid that the place is not Mr. Zhang's clinic. Therefore, this information is disclosed so that those with fractures can seek treatment and avoid the delay that could lead to permanent disability.

### Returned Overseas Chinese Wang Zhonghai Talks About the Extreme Economic Difficulties Facing Japan

Frequent Conscription in the Country Leads to Widespread Grievances, Business for Overseas Chinese Declines, Many Plan to Return

Japan's launch of the invasion of China, as those in the know had predicted, is only accelerating the collapse of its national economy and plunging the country into serious difficulties. According to Mr. Wang Zhonghai, an overseas Chinese who returned to the country recently on the French postal ship "Andre Lebon," since Japan's unprovoked provocation at the Lugouqiao in North China and the outbreak of the August 13 Shanghai battle, its domestic military has been frequently conscripted. Not only have young men in the countryside been forced to serve in the military, but also workers in factories and shop assistants in cities have been successively drafted to serve as reservists for dispatch. As for military supplies, the people are forced to provide them, which is extremely demanding. Now, various taxes have been increased one after another, while prices have soared, and supply and demand are unbalanced. Life is painful, and public grievances are boiling. Looking at its domestic economic situation, it has fallen into an extreme situation. The price of timber and galvanized iron has increased more than three times compared to before the war. Now, if cities need to build houses, the government has restricted the use of steel to no more than five tons, and violators will be fined. This shows the shortage of military supplies and the urgency of replenishment. In short, if our country can wage a protracted war of resistance, then the invading army will inevitably retreat due to the inability of its domestic economy to support it. As for the business of overseas Chinese in Japan, it has naturally plummeted. Now, in view of the inability to live in that country for a long time and in order to express their determination to resist the war, many plan to return.

### Our Army's Left Wing Launches a Full-Scale Counterattack, the Enemy Spying on Dachang is Already in a Predicament

Our Heavy Artillery Bombards the Enemy's Position All Night, Achieving Results; Our Army Continues to Advance at Various Strongholds on the Left Wing; The Situation at Gejiapailou is in a Standoff

For several consecutive days, the enemy has been using all its strength to attack our Dachang line on several routes. On the front, they advanced south along the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, once breaking through our Maqiaozhai position. After our counterattack, they were repelled and are now stalemated in the Yujiazhai area. Our forces are strong and our defenses are solid, and the enemy on the front has suffered a serious blow. To the west of the highway, the enemy broke through from Heida Huangzhai and advanced to Bashiqiao, crossing the Fengcun Pond and reaching the area between Gejiapailou and Huanggang, attempting to encircle and attack from the side, attacking Dachang. After our army's strict interception and encirclement, the enemy was in a difficult situation and trapped in a predicament. As of this noon, the enemy on this line had no more strength to attack and is now actively reorganizing, replenishing, and gathering reinforcements, planning to make a final struggle. At dawn this morning, there was a fierce battle between the two sides, but it only lasted for an hour. The two armies are now in a stalemate. We are holding the original defense line, and the enemy will never succeed. To the east of the highway, the enemy has not dared to try lightly. There has been no major battle since last night until this noon. Last night, our artillery positions on the left wing bombarded the enemy's position on Yunzaobang without interruption, and the enemy's fortifications were severely damaged. With the cover of fierce artillery fire, our left wing launched a full-scale counterattack against the enemy. The enemy was caught off guard, leaving corpses everywhere and fleeing in panic. Our army quickly returned victoriously to its original position and advanced hundreds of meters in several places. More than a dozen enemy planes took off at night, circling and reconnoitering in places such as Zhenru and Dachang, and releasing flares for indiscriminate bombing, but we suffered no damage.

### Enemy Troops Trying to Break Through at Gejiapailou This Morning Were Repelled

The Enemy Suffered Heavy Losses and Its Activity Greatly Reduced; Confrontation Across the River in the Batouzhai Area

To the north of Dachang, the battle is still raging. Our army's defense line is extremely solid. The enemy, who used all its strength to attack Dachang, suffered heavy losses after being attacked by our army in Gejiapailou, Huanggang, Yujiazhai, and other places, and dared not continue to advance. After two days and two nights of bloody battles, the enemy troops were obviously exhausted and unable to support themselves. Last night, the enemy's activity was greatly reduced and was only able to barely support our army's fierce counterattack. The intruding enemy troops were extremely busy building fortifications in the rear, preparing for our army's counterattack, and using the area as a base for continuing their attacks. At 4:30 this morning, the enemy troops attempted to break through and attacked our army fiercely, and the bloody battle resumed. Our army bravely went forward and wiped them out. Under the concentrated fire of the enemy troops, they fell forward and continued to charge, killing countless enemies who were trying to break out. After this heavy blow, the enemy troops retreated to their original position. This morning, the front line only had mutual shelling and machine gun fire. The enemy in Gejiapailou and Huanggang, west of the highway, is still surrounded by our army. Our army is about to launch a major offensive to annihilate them. To the northwest of Gejiapailou, on the south bank of Fengcun Pond, west of Zhangjialouxia, in the area of Batouzhai, Zhujiazhai, and Houjiazhai, the Chen site on our army's left wing is extremely solid. Our enemy armies are confronting each other across the river, firing at each other with artillery, machine guns, and rifles. Our army is closely guarded, not allowing them to cross. There have been no changes in the important positions.

### Our Left Wing Army Counterattacked Last Night

Our Artillery Fiercely Bombed the Enemy's Position; Gejiapailou is Controlled by Us

Our reporter recently met with a military officer who arrived in Shanghai this morning from the front line, who told us about the battle last night. A summary is given below: ㊀ Last night at 8 o'clock, the various units of our left wing were ordered to counterattack. A certain senior officer personally went to the front line to command, and the morale was boosted. By midnight, all units had advanced forward. The enemy had been attacked fiercely by our army for several days and its morale had been weakened. ㊁ Last night, our artillery positions continuously fired shells, bombarding the enemy army like rain. It was heard clearly in the west of Shanghai. However, the enemy rarely returned fire. ㊂ Several enemy planes circled back and forth in the Zhenru area after 8 o'clock last night and released flares, intending to detect the artillery positions, but our army paid no attention and continued to fire shells. The enemy planes gained nothing. ㊃ Gejiapailouzhai has been reduced to scorched earth after being destroyed by artillery fire. It is now under our army's control and the enemy has no power to attack. ㊄ In Dachang, our army has built solid fortifications. Although the enemy is stubborn, it will be difficult to invade.

### Our Army's Progress in Luodian

The enemy disregards international law by using tear gas; newly arrived troops are exceptionally cowardly.

According to a certain director who returned this morning from the Luodian front lines, the enemy troops arrayed with their backs to the Yunzaobang River have suffered significant losses in strength after four days and nights of bloody battles. However, their ambition to invade Dachang has not been thwarted. According to reliable reports from the front, the enemy troops will draw on the right-wing forces from the Luodian area to replenish their strength south of the Yunzaobang River. A certain commander of our troops guarding the front lines in that area, in order to crush the enemy's plan, adopted a strategy of counter-offense. Starting at 8:00 PM last night, he ordered a general attack on the enemy. The intensity of the artillery fire was unprecedented. When the director left the front lines at midnight, news of victory had already arrived. Our troops on the Shi Xiang Gong Temple and Cao Wang Temple lines have aggressively advanced one thousand several hundred meters towards the enemy in the Luodian area. The battle is still developing fiercely. Furthermore, the small unit of enemy troops that secretly landed at Baimaokou earlier was completely eliminated by our forces yesterday. During the clearing of the battlefield, a portion of ×× shells were found and have been handed over to the higher authorities.

A reporter from the Central News Agency accompanying the army from Guangfu reported at 11:30 AM on the 21st that the enemy in the area of Laodan House, Qin House, and Zhangjia Village, northwest of Luodian, has recently been replaced. The discipline of their newly arrived troops is very poor. Whenever they are hit by our aircraft and artillery, they shout loudly and become extremely chaotic and cowardly. They fire their guns wildly day and night to bolster their courage. However, their machine gunners seem quite composed.

A reporter from the Central News Agency accompanying the army from Guangfu reported at 11:30 AM on the 21st that the battle lines from Luodian to Guangfu were relatively calm from last night until this morning. Only a unit of enemy troops from the Liuhang area launched a fierce attack on the areas of Laolu House and Xinlu House. Our troops bravely resisted and repelled them after multiple engagements. It is found that Laolu House and Xinlu House are the protective screen southeast of Guangfu. The enemy's invasion of Guangfu has been under considerable threat in recent days. Therefore, the enemy is extremely keen on invading these two locations. However, we have long stationed strong forces there, and it will be difficult for the enemy to succeed if they attack.

### Enemy's Attack on Jiangwan Immediately Repelled

In the Jiangwan area, after our forces heavily attacked and inflicted serious damage on the enemy forces surrounding the Sijing Ball Field in the past two days, our forces simultaneously launched a fierce offensive against the enemy from the direction of the Sports Association Road, along Xiangyin Road, and Fudan University in a large encirclement. Our forces have made considerable progress. The rest of the two lines from Jiangwan to Zhabei have seen no fierce fighting, except for forward outposts engaging and artillery duels. This morning at dawn, the enemy in the downtown area, under the cover of armored vehicles, launched an offensive against our Jiangwan positions with a large detachment of infantry. Although their attack was fierce, it was immediately repelled by our concentrated firepower, and after an hour of intense fighting, the enemy was unable to withstand and retreated, leaving many corpses behind. Reliable sources reported that there were occasional skirmishes around Baoshan Road and Yinxiang District last night, with the sound of machine guns starting and stopping intermittently. Between 5:30 AM and 6:00 AM this morning, enemy warships opened fire on the Baoshan Road area, while there was artillery fire in the Dachang area. Around 8:00 AM, enemy aircraft dropped three heavy bombs on the Lianglu Administration Building. The railway line west of the North Station was also bombed. At the same time, enemy troops shelled the area around the Maigen Road station. A large fire broke out behind the Nippon Yusen wharf in Pudong. Around 11:00 AM, there were concentrated machine gun and mortar fire in the area of Beijiangxi Road (the section where roads were built across the boundary) and the Jinghu Railway line.

### Enemy Aircraft Bomb Zhabei Again

Fire near the North Station extinguished immediately

Starting at 7:00 AM today, three groups of enemy aircraft, consisting of three and two aircraft each, circled again over Baoshan Road, Xinmin Road, and the public concession along the Suzhou River. At 7:30 AM, the three enemy aircraft dropped three more bombs, bombing the Lianglu Administration Building and the surrounding areas of the North Station. Numerous bombs also fell on Qiujiang Road, North Han Bridge, and Song Park Road. At 8:30 AM and around 12:00 PM, three more aircraft dropped six heavy bombs on the North Station area, creating thick smoke all around the station. The newly renovated east and west sides of the sampan factory along the Suzhou River were also hit by three bombs each. The fire at the intersection of Changan Road and Haichang Road, which had already been extinguished by the fire brigade, was reignited by continuous bombing from enemy aircraft. Fortunately, the fire was extinguished again after the fire brigade made strenuous efforts.

A reporter from the Central News Agency accompanying the army from Jiangwan reported at 12:25 PM on the 21st that before dawn this morning, the enemy at the Sijing Ball Field attacked our guard lines near Fudan University and Tanjia House for the second time, but were repelled each time. In the Baziqiao House area, the enemy continuously fired to create disturbances. However, after daybreak, the entire line became quiet.

### We Shot Down an Enemy Aircraft at Huacao Town

Both pilots killed instantly

A reporter from the Central News Agency accompanying the army from Jiangwan reported at 12:25 PM on the 21st that at 10:00 AM this morning, an enemy aircraft was shot down by us and crashed near the Suzhou River in Huacao Town, catching fire upon impact. Both pilots were killed instantly.

### Enemy Officers' Deaths and Injuries Confirmed

Japanese aircraft frequently crash

The Central News Agency reports that the enemy suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Liuhang on the 6th, 7th, and 8th of this month. Their military headquarters announced that six officers with the rank of major or higher were killed or seriously wounded. Tokujiro Iizuka died in battle at Sujia House; Jojiro Unno was seriously wounded by a bullet at Yangjia House; Masao Sato was seriously wounded by a bullet in Liuhang, with a hole through his right chest. Additionally, Sueki Nakayama died in battle; Teiichiro Inaba and Michikazu Ishida were both seriously wounded, but the locations were not specified. Furthermore, the enemy, realizing the weakness of their air force and the significant sacrifices of their combatants, is actively engaged in training, leading to aircraft accidents almost every day. According to the Tokyo Asahi, a fighter plane crashed at Kagamigahara Airfield on the afternoon of the 6th, completely destroying the aircraft and killing Chief Petty Officer Tsutomu Imai on the spot. The Osaka Mainichi also reported that on the morning of the 9th, two aircraft collided in the air at Kasumigaura Naval Airfield. One aircraft was piloted by instructor Lieutenant Commander Motohachi Miyazaki, who crashed to the ground and died.

### Our Air Force Carried Out Nine Night Raids Causing Extremely Heavy Damage to the Enemy

Yufeng Cotton Mill hit by bombs and caught fire; military supplies destroyed, casualties heavy

Our air force carried out nine raids on enemy positions between 7:09 PM last night and 2:18 AM this morning. The enemy opened fire with anti-aircraft guns. Fragments of artillery shells fell within the Huisi area. Our forces dropped bombs in the following locations: ⑴ 10:35 PM, Pingliang Road (near Dinghai Road); ⑵ 1:20 AM, Yangshupu Road (near Linqing Road); ⑶ 1:50 AM, Yangshupu Road (near Ewo Cotton Mill). All three locations caught fire due to being hit by bombs. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties and losses.

At 1:40 AM this morning, our air force dropped bombs and bombarded enemy positions in the eastern district. An incendiary bomb hit the Ewo Cotton Mill on Yangshupu Road, causing a large fire. There were shrapnel in the reeling and sorting rooms. Indian staff members in the factory reported to the fire brigade, which dispatched vehicles to extinguish the fire. The Yufeng Cotton Mill on Dinghai Road was also hit by bombs and caught fire, destroying six staff residences. Military supplies stockpiled there by the enemy were completely destroyed, causing even heavier casualties.

### Fierce Battles North of Dachang Ceased Not All Night

Our forces retake Huangjia House in a night raid; we defend our original positions on both sides of the highway

A reporter from the Central News Agency accompanying the army from Jiangwan reported at 12:25 PM on the 21st that battles raged all night at several locations south of the Yunzaobang River, along Fengcun Pond and the Liuhang-Dachang highway. After the enemy's southward advance was blocked and their westward attacks failed, they continued to harass us, as they still had considerable progress along the highway.

Enemy fiercely attacks Gaoqiao House

Gaoqiao House, a critical point on the highway, was subjected to the fiercest attacks. The enemy was stationed at Zhangyu House and Changjilou, where they massed large forces. We were encircled by the enemy from the northwest on both sides. The enemy at Zhangyu House attacked last midnight. We fought bravely and held out until this morning. The enemy attacks were very fierce, and the enemy at Changjilou also continuously harassed us in support. However, we counterattacked from the left and right, handling the situation with ease. By daybreak, the enemy had not succeeded and gradually retreated, and the battle became quiet. At Luzhai and Sujiaqiao House, small groups of enemy troops constantly harassed us from last night until this morning, resulting in only minor skirmishes.

Our night raids were quite successful

Huangjia House, west of the highway, was attacked and captured by the enemy on the afternoon of the 18th, using multiple tanks. However, the enemy only stationed a small number of troops there. Yesterday, we attempted a night raid, which was quite successful. The enemy offered slight resistance and then retreated north. Our forward outposts retook the position. Yu House, about 600 meters south of Huangjia House, is also an important stronghold west of the highway. The enemy attacked three times since 10:00 PM last night. The attack at 2:00 AM this morning was particularly intense, making the battle the fiercest. However, our forces defended our original positions throughout. When the enemy realized they could not succeed by daybreak, they also retreated.

Enemy troops gather on both sides of the highway

The battles at all locations became quiet after daybreak. Soon, multiple enemy tanks advanced slowly from the south of Tang Bridge, still attempting to encroach towards Dachang. Our Chenjia House, Jixiang House, and Maqiao House are located on both sides of the highway, serving as the protective screen for Dachang. Enemy tanks massed there and launched fierce attacks. Multiple enemy aircraft dropped bombs to assist in the battle. Our forces calmly fought back under the combined air and ground attack of the enemy. As of the time of the report, the battle was still ongoing.

Before the departure, many reporters, especially reporters from China and Japan, asked if the severity of the international situation was equal to that of 1914. Davis refused to comment, saying only, 'I am not a prophet. We are going to Brussels this time at the invitation of the Belgian government to seek constructive and peaceful solutions to the Sino-Japanese dispute in accordance with Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty. We have neither taken any constraints nor hold any prejudices. In short, the US government is prepared to seek any path that can achieve peace.' The spokesman for the US delegation said that the Brussels meeting would focus purely on the Nine-Power Treaty and would not be involved with the League of Nations. However, if the meeting ultimately fails, the League of Nations will continue to take action. The current position taken by the United States is to leave room for Japan to maneuver.

Brief Comments

### Cotton Vests

The soldiers at the front, guarding the land for the country, are fighting bloody battles. Now that the autumn wind is blowing and the air is getting chilly, the public, motivated by patriotism, has donated no less than hundreds of thousands of cotton vests. The three armies receive them as if they have been blessed. This truly boosts morale and stimulates morale. Indirectly, it is enough to chill the enemy's courage and promote its rapid collapse. It is a very meaningful event. The government, seeing the public's enthusiasm, ordered an investigation into incentives, which of course should have government orders. However, the public's voluntary donation does not question whether the government has rewards. It shows that the government, the people, and the army are a cohesive unit. The significance is even greater. Now, the north is already cold. The ice and snow are on the road. Frostbite is imminent. We can expand and enrich it. Change cotton vests to leather vests, and transport them to the north. Let the soldiers hold the key to the northern gates. The government has no worries about the north. I hope the gentlemen and people of the south will enthusiastically donate. We are looking forward to it.

### Enemy Warships Harass the Coastal Areas of Chaozhou and Shantou

Destroying the lighthouse in Shantou Port, occupying various small islands, and surveying; fishermen defend themselves and attack enemy boats

Shantou Communication: Enemy warships are blockading the coastal line of Guangdong Province. Outside the port of Shantou, enemy warships often send marines on small electric boats to intercept fishing boats, causing more than 100,000 fishermen in Darang, Nanao, Tuolin, and Haimen to become unemployed. Also, the reefs near Biaojiao and Guangao are undulating. This place is close to the construction line and is a must-pass place for ships sailing at night. There is a lighthouse on a small island in the area, managed by a foreigner sent by the sea and several Chinese workers, living in a stone house on the island. Apart from raising medicine and taros, their food depends entirely on the supply from Shantou. In the latter half of last month, it had also been invaded by more than 30 enemy marines who destroyed the lighthouse, forced the foreigner in the lighthouse to hand over self-defense guns, and forcibly seized all the liquor, meat, and canned food they had made. As a result, personnel at the Zhuxia and Chi Han lighthouses have resigned. Now, the lighthouses no longer emit light at night, which makes it very dangerous for ships passing through the area. Also, the enemy marines had invaded the vicinity of Guangao and were repelled by the local ×× team. After surveying several small islands in the area, the enemy has already left because they were not suitable. In the 26th year [of the Republic], enemy warships sent patrol boats to attack fishing boats near both Aos. The fishing boats immediately hoisted their sails and quickly returned to Ao Island's Qianjiang. The enemy boats still followed and opened fire. The soldiers and militiamen guarding Qianjiang saw the enemy boats approaching and returned fire, covering the escaping fishermen. The enemy then retreated. In less than an hour, another enemy warship sailed to Nanao and shelled Qianjiang. Our army also returned fire. After two hours, the enemy warship retreated towards Zhao'an. On that day, one or two of our soldiers and civilians were killed or injured. At that time, two wooden boats from Dongshan Island in Fujian Province were carrying passengers and goods to Huanggang in Rao County. They encountered an enemy warship in the sea off Shao'an. The enemy warship immediately sent a patrol boat to chase them. Knowing that their methods were vicious and that there was no chance of survival, the two wooden boats immediately spread out in a figure-eight formation. The fire powder cannons on the boats had also been loaded with medicine and covered with clothes. When the enemy patrol boat approached, they fired cannons, sinking the enemy patrol boat and thirty enemy soldiers into the sea. The enemy warship then opened fire in retaliation. The two wooden boats also sank, killing forty boatmen and passengers. More than a dozen people who were good at swimming were able to swim to the shore of Dagang and survived. The fishermen along the coast hate the enemy deeply. Once they encounter an enemy boat, they will never let it survive. In the past, many fishermen were timid and did not resist. After being captured by the enemy, both of their ears were pierced and strung together with thick iron wires, forty people in a row, and thrown into the sea to play with and amuse themselves, or they were sealed in a cabin and set the ship on fire, burning them to death. The most outrageous thing was to inject poison needles into their arms and send them home. They died of poisoning ten days later. It is heard that enemy ships have recruited former smugglers as guides, because they are familiar with the coastal reefs and the depth of the sea. Therefore, enemy ships dare to go deep into Guangao, Aotou, Donghu, Caogou, Bingzhou, and the lakes. Many of the people driving enemy boats to pursue fishing boats are dressed in white sailor uniforms, but their faces are traitors and smugglers that the fishermen have recognized for many years. The fishermen in Haifeng, facing livelihood problems, decided to arm themselves and go to sea to make a living. Their fishing boats are equipped with fire powder cannons and platform guns. They predict that enemy ships will not necessarily hit them with artillery fire. If enemy patrol boats come after them, they can fight to the death. On the 25th of last month, four large fishing boats were chased and captured by an enemy warship that sent a patrol boat and more than thirty marines to Shanwei. One boat had already been captured and towed to the vicinity of the warship. The fishermen saw that they had reached the final moment and immediately lit fire powder cannons and blasted them towards the warship, killing more than a dozen enemy marines on the spot. Then, they opened fire and sank the enemy patrol boat. The enemy then opened fire and sank the fishing boat, killing and injuring dozens of people. The other two fishing boats took the opportunity to escape. Such a heroic sacrifice was unexpected by the enemy warships. Also, many of the fishermen who were previously captured by enemy warships were burned to death in the cabins. Their inhumanity has reached such an extent, so the fishermen hate them very much.

Enemy warships in the sea area of Chaozhou and Shantou not only send marines on speedboats every day to drive away fishing boats, but also secretly land and practice on the secluded coast in an attempt to expand the scope of harassment. On the 2nd of this month, the enemy troops had broken into Pujangkeng on Nanao Island and cut off the telephone poles there. County magistrate Lin Jiezhi immediately sent a team to search. Eight enemy soldiers fled by boat. Now the telephone lines there have been repaired, and the entire island can talk. The Guandi Temple at Qianjiangwei was hit by eight artillery shells from enemy warships. The front building collapsed and three houses of the militiamen were destroyed. Two civilians were killed and three were injured. On the morning of the 6th, three enemy aircraft flew out to scout the border area between Shao'an and Xiaomin Guangdong, flying far over Jiaoling, Longyan, Zhang Xia, and at high altitude without dropping bombs.

### Wenling Traitorous Merchants Transport Rice to Support the Enemy

Various Groups Request Strict Punishment of Traitorous Merchants

Taizhou Communication: In Songmen, Shitou, and other places in the southern district of Wenling County, some traitorous merchants smuggled 439 bags of rice, pretending to go out to sea. They were seized and taken to the county by the security police stationed at Ruoheng. With the approval of the county government, they were publicly auctioned in the county warehouse a few days ago. Now, the county's Chamber of Commerce, Farmers' Association, Workers' Union, and other groups have jointly telegraphed the county government, asking to detain and investigate the rice-smuggling traitorous merchants, according to Chinese law, and do this for the future.

Also, it is reported that traitorous merchants have recently been discovered smuggling rice out to sea in Tingtou, Hefan, and other places in the western district of Wenling. In order to avoid public attention, these traitorous merchants have been very secretive in their smuggling methods. They secretly pack the rice into kerosene tanks, sealing them with tin under the pretext of solidity, tying one end of the rope to the rice tank and the other end to the side of the sea, submerging the rice tank in the seawater, towing it out to sea, and selling it to the enemy in the sea area of Damai Island (where many enemy warships are moored). These traitorous merchants then use the money they get to buy tax-evading goods to sell inland, making even more profit.

### Songjiang

Enemy Distributes Absurd Leaflets

At 2:12 PM on the 15th, an enemy plane attacked Songjiang, circling above the four city gates three times. Afterwards, it released a large number of printed materials at a height of 1,000 meters in the western suburbs. An investigation revealed that the printed materials were issued by the enemy's 'New Shen Bao' newspaper, located at 455 Zhapu Road, Shanghai. The content was all in Chinese, with absurd sentences intended to disrupt the rear. Citizens who picked them up tore them up and discarded them on the ground.

Xia Jia-san Destroys Home to Save the Country

Xia Jia-san, a resident south of Jinzhao Temple in this county, recently sent a house and stock certificates from the local telephone company to the Public Organization Committee, requesting that they be sold to generously support the soldiers at the front. The committee approved the request, praising Mr. Xia's destruction of his home to save the country as highly commendable. In addition to a letter of thanks, personnel were dispatched yesterday to verify and receive the items.

### Jiading

Enemy Plane Bombs and Kills Police Officer

The county government was mostly destroyed by enemy planes bombing it on August 23rd. The surrounding area was also largely affected. In recent days, enemy planes have frequently wreaked havoc. Although the residents in the city have all fled, the police station is still on duty to prevent and investigate spies. At 12:30 PM on the 12th of this month, police officer Ma Lian-sheng was on duty near the county government when an enemy plane suddenly came and dropped a bomb, unfortunately hitting him in a vital area and killing him immediately. It is reported that Xu, the head of the county police station, has reported the situation of the officer's diligent and selfless death to County Magistrate Zhang and plans to grant him preferential treatment.

### Danyang

Enemy Planes Strafe Danyang

At 1:10 PM on the 15th, six enemy planes flew westward from Shandong, flying very low when passing over Danyang. They circled in the sky for 20 minutes, strafing four times with machine guns over the station and Fusi Temple in the northern suburbs. Each burst of gunfire consisted of about ten shots, approximately 100 meters from the military station. A civilian house was hit by three bullets, and a cook was shot in the head, seriously injured.

### Yangzhou

All Sectors Contribute to National Salvation Bonds

For National Salvation Bonds, Jiangdu County has been assigned 600,000 yuan, and a fundraising branch has been established. In addition to separately collecting contributions based on official positions and wealth, land will be taxed at 40% of the total tax amount for the 26th year (i.e., 4 jiao per yuan). Collection began on the 15th of this month. Business employees will be taxed one month's salary, similar to civil servants, with the Chamber of Commerce responsible for collecting and remitting the funds. Teachers and staff will contribute according to their salaries, and middle school students will purchase 5 yuan each. In addition, those who voluntarily subscribe are extremely enthusiastic, and it is expected that the amount collected will exceed the target.

Two Strange Visitors Arrive on Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Train

On the evening train from Zhenjiang to Yangzhou on the 14th, strange merchants (around 40 years old) who had come to buy antiques, along with a local youth (around 20 years old) disguised as Chinese, dressed in Qing student attire, carrying a rough cloth bundle, rushed into Fuyun Gate in rickshaws. A strong man in the same car recognized their appearance and voice (speaking in a northern Beijing accent, but not pure), and quickly reported it to the authorities. After checking the hotel without success, strict orders have been issued to the Baoding and Jia system to investigate and search, and the city gate guards are paying attention.

### Shaoxing

Strictly Prohibit Providing Grain to the Enemy

The Ning-Shao Martial Law Command recently stated that enemy warships are patrolling overseas, buying grain at high prices. Some unscrupulous gentry and merchants are colluding with each other to smuggle it out. Yesterday, a special order was issued to the coastal county magistrates of the two districts to pay special attention to the investigation and prohibition of this activity.

### Hefei

Enemy Planes Bomb Hefei

It is reported that since the start of the Shanghai battle, the city has maintained order as usual. However, at 4:10 PM on the 13th, three enemy bombers and three fighter planes, divided into two teams, flew from Bengbu and Tianjia'an along the Huainan Road to Hefei for an air raid. The first team turned towards Zhangdagang outside the east gate and dropped five or six heavy bombs. The second team flew high above the city, circling once from northeast to southwest, dropping six or seven bombs in succession and then retreating along the original route. The air raid alert was lifted at 4:30 PM. Subsequent investigation revealed that the bombs mostly landed in nearby open areas and fields. Except for Gao Jitang, a former member of parliament, who was killed by the bombing, and one Mr. Zhang who was injured, there were no other losses.

### Telegraph Bureau Announcement Regarding Procedures for Sending Secret Telegrams

Businesses Sending Telegrams to Submit Seal Impressions; Foreign Secret Telegrams Require Consular Certification

Domestic business telegrams in code have resumed being accepted and sent as usual since the 10th of this month. The requirement to add the old store chop and the manager's chop to the bottom of the telegrams from the same date onwards was mentioned in this newspaper on the 11th. Yesterday, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau issued a further announcement stating: It has been previously announced that all sectors sending telegrams should have the store chop and manager's signature or chop on the bottom of the telegrams. In order to facilitate all sectors, the Bureau has prepared a type of seal impression card. All businesses sending telegrams are requested to write to the Bureau to request a seal impression card (stating the name, address, and nature of the business in the letter). Hereafter, the seal impression at the bottom of the telegram will be based on the retained seal impression. Private individuals sending telegrams should still add their occupation and occupational address in addition to their name and address. If necessary, they should also fill out a survey form or seek a shop guarantee. Furthermore, from October 15th onwards, all foreign businesses sending secret telegrams should first ask the consul to provide a letter of responsibility stating that the content of the telegram does not contain any political or military news. If the consul cannot provide a letter of certification, then each secret telegram should have the consul's office stamp on the bottom of the telegram before it can be sent. The Bureau may still request to inspect the codebook for any business telegram at any time. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention.

### National Salvation Mobile Drama Troupe

Departs for the Jinpu Railway Line

Since the July 7th Incident, the national salvation movement has surged across the country, especially in the theatrical world, which has become even more active. The "China Drama Society," which has always been active in the capital, has twice performed anti-Japanese national salvation plays, such as "The Traitor's Descendants," "Roar Like Hebei," "Alarm," and "Our Homeland." Although there were rumors that the China Drama Society would form a national salvation mobile drama troupe, the news gradually faded. The week before last, it was suddenly learned that Dai Ya, Hong Zhenglun, Leng Bo, and others, who are the backbone of "China Drama," had all come to the town. The reporter visited them and learned that the society had not abandoned its theatrical mission and was working urgently. Because the organization of the national salvation mobile drama troupe had to be firm and solid, and the route and transportation also had to be carefully planned, the departure of the troupe was delayed. It is now heard that the troupe has been prepared and is led by Leng Bo and Hong Zhenglun, and will depart for the north along the Jinpu Railway Line on the 16th. The first stage of the troupe's work will be in Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and northern Jiangsu.

### What Female Compatriots Should Do During the War of Resistance

— Wu Yufang

We know that the liberation war of the entire Chinese nation has already begun. We must awaken the people of the entire country and mobilize them to participate in these national salvation and war of resistance movements in order to achieve final victory. I think this is a meaning that the majority can understand. What I want to bring up here is how to mobilize our 250 million women across the country to take on the mission of resisting aggression and saving the country.

Since the outbreak of the war of resistance in North China and Shanghai, in addition to the general rescue personnel serving at the front, women have also risen up to participate enthusiastically in nursing, comfort, recruitment, relief singing, etc., and have been able to show a proactive spirit of service. In particular, in the wartime service corps of the Boy Scouts in Shanghai, there are already more than 300 girl scouts participating in the work. This fearless spirit of the girls of the new China can be said to be a first discovery. The female team members who participated in the Red Cross are also as brave as the male team members, braving bullets and shrapnel on the front line to rescue wounded soldiers and refugees. Although the enemy disregarded international law, at the Southeast Hospital in Zhenru, when many Boy Scouts and Red Cross rescue teams were working there, the enemy planes aimed their machine guns at them, killing and injuring several. However, they continued to bravely carry out the work they should do. The girl scouts and female Red Cross team members participating in the rescue work worked hard day and night, providing loyal service. On the other hand, the girl scouts working in the wounded soldiers' hospitals handled everything related to the wounded soldiers every day, writing letters for the wounded soldiers, mending clothes and socks, washing bedding, bandaging wounds, singing patriotic songs, telling patriotic stories, performing patriotic short plays—and so on. They simply made every wounded soldier forget the pain of their wounds and get infinite comfort. As for the girl scouts serving in the refugee shelters, they also wrote letters with the refugees, comforted the elders in their hometowns, and sent the sick to the hospital. The girl scouts had a wealth of common sense about the nutrition of children and the recuperation of mothers, and they were able to deal with them properly. There, whether it was the wounded soldiers or the refugees, or even the general public, seeing the girl scouts' considerate and loyal service, they were all moved to tears. This is direct and deep sympathy for the wounded soldiers and refugees. In other work, such as soliciting winter clothing, the girl scouts set out every day in the alleys of the roads to solicit from the residents, always returning very late, never feeling tired, and each bringing back many winter clothes for the refugees with an excited spirit. Their happiness can also be said to be the seed of every refugee's happiness. This kind of spirit is rarely seen even in foreign countries. It not only shows the patriotic enthusiasm of the girls of the new China, not lagging behind others, but also leads the women of the whole country to surge towards the front line of national salvation like a tide—

Now, in order to make the efficiency of our work even greater, women at the front and in the rear should unite to participate in the following war of resistance work:

(1) To encourage the spirit of the soldiers and relieve their families—We should not only provide medical treatment and comfort to the wounded soldiers, but also provide appropriate relief to their families. We must unite and gather the women in the area to promote the women in all areas to unite to organize comfort groups to investigate the hometowns, addresses, and economic conditions of the families of the fallen soldiers, and earnestly carry out relief matters.

(2) Train the refugees to understand the enemy's brutality! The establishment of refugee shelters is temporary. Sooner or later, the refugees must be sent back to their hometowns. Women's groups should instruct them in the refugee shelters to understand the Japanese imperialists' ambition to invade and lead them to the path of national salvation. When they return to their hometowns, at least they can have a more accurate propaganda effect. At the same time, train them to return to their hometowns to launch various national salvation works.

(3) Participate in production work as much as possible—Under this special long-term war situation, all production undertakings in the war zone are either suspended or destroyed by the enemy. It is impossible to predict how far the war will expand in the future, but most of the men must go to the front line to fight the enemy. Then, all industry and commerce must rely on women to continue working in order to regulate the economy. On the one hand, the government and industrialists should find ways to move industry and commerce to the interior. Our vast number of women have an unshirkable responsibility to rise up and participate in the construction of this national industry. In addition, we should organize various military supply manufacturing plants, such as gas masks, cotton-padded military uniforms, and other woolen fabrics. With our manufacturing plants, we can have a continuous supply. If the strong men in the countryside are either transferred to the front line or sent for training, the women should also take on the task of planting in the fields. At this critical juncture of national crisis, our women should go to factories as much as possible—to military supply manufacturing plants—to the fields!

(4) To relieve out-of-school children—Women must actively carry out relief for out-of-school children under the enemy's artillery fire. For all young children who have escaped from the war zone, we must find ways to give them the opportunity to continue their studies. For the general public, we should also broadly promote literacy education, and we must go deep into the people to universally educate them about all kinds of wartime knowledge in order to avoid unnecessary and unresistant sacrifices. What is especially important is to launch their patriotic enthusiasm in education.

(5) Raise winter clothing and comfort items. When the weather turns cold, the homeless refugees will definitely have no clothes to keep warm. Therefore, women should work like girl scouts, moving and collecting winter clothing and distributing them to the refugee shelters. The second is the collection of comfort items to comfort the soldiers and wounded soldiers on the front line.

(6) Protect mothers and children—Refugee shelters are full of mothers and children. Women should also earnestly organize themselves to engage in the work of nursing mothers and protecting children. Within the possible scope, we should try our best to evacuate children to safe areas to avoid the enemy's destruction. A wartime children's protection association can be organized to take care of them and educate them, because children are the new life of our nation, and everyone should be responsible for their protection. It is most appropriate for women to take on this task.

(7) Engage in small organizations in various roads and alleys—In the War of Resistance in Shanghai, the strength of our morale made the enemy tremble with fear, but we inevitably suffered minor setbacks, mostly because of the actions of traitors. Therefore, eliminating traitors is a very important task. Women should rise up to engage in the organization of various roads and alleys (refer to the second issue of the War of Resistance for methods). For convenience, the following is a brief description in separate articles:

A. Publicize general wartime knowledge.

B. Maintain the security of the neighborhood, such as preventing the activities of traitors and guiding air-raid shelters and poison gas prevention.

C. Tell the day's war news.

D. Advocate frugality, save as much as possible, contribute to the country, and promote the movement of donating money, and persuade the women in the alley to contribute or exchange gold and silver jewelry and utensils for government bonds.

E. Hold neighborhood consumption or production cooperatives.

F. Group together to comfort the wounded soldiers and relieve the refugees.

G. Hold neighborhood kindergartens or primary schools to relieve out-of-school children who have escaped from the war zone.

H. Local propaganda work such as drama broadcasting, singing, lectures, sending reports, and writing reports.

In summary, we hope that female compatriots across the country will unite to build a sound women's national salvation front, launch the above-mentioned anti-Japanese works, and jointly assume the mission of resisting aggression and saving the country.
