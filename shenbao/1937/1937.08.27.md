### Complete Resolution of Stubborn Enemy in Luodian, Enemy's Main Force Invasion Plan Fails

Countless Enemies Killed, All Supplies and Ammunition Seized. Zha Pu's Coastal Defense is Consolidated, No Enemy Troops Landed.

At 1:00 AM this morning, according to front-line news received by this newspaper, our army pursued the remaining enemy forces northeast of Luodian Town with irresistible force, and the situation was resolved by approximately 7:00 PM last night. The enemy's main force invasion plan has completely failed at this point. Countless enemies were killed and all of the supplies and ammunition left behind by the enemy were seized by our forces. Our army is actively advancing, searching for remaining enemies on one hand, and on the other hand, joining forces with the garrison troops in the Shizilin area to increase our strength along the coast. About ten miles northwest of Luodian, there are still more than a thousand remaining enemy soldiers, scurrying about everywhere, their retreat cut off, and they are trapped in a dilemma. Our army is pursuing and severely suppressing them, and they can be cleared up in the shortest possible time. In addition, when the enemy advanced to Luodian on the morning of the 25th, enemy traces were also found at the same time in the direction of Liuhekou. Our garrison troops along the coast immediately responded calmly, and the enemy ultimately failed to succeed. However, there are still more than ten enemy warships outside the port, preparing to take the opportunity to land at any time. Our army has stepped up its vigilance, with abundant forces, and there is absolutely no problem.

### Stubborn Enemy in Luodian Town Defeated and Retreating

Completely defeated at 7:00 PM last night, our army advances to Shizilin Fortress

According to a front-line report at 11:00 PM last night, the remaining enemy soldiers northeast of Luodian Town were fiercely pursued by our army. The enemy was defeated in a panic and was completely resolved by 7:00 PM last night. Our army has advanced to the Shizilin Fortress and is on strict alert. In the northwest of the town, there are still a small number of enemy troops, about a thousand people, currently engaged in fierce fighting with our army.

Central News Agency: According to a certain military agency, the enemy troops near Luodian have been heavily surrounded by our army and are being disarmed. The enemy troops who launched a second attack on Luodian have also been blocked by our army, surrounded and engaged in fierce fighting, which can be resolved in the shortest possible time.

Central News Agency: The enemy troops in Luodian have retreated after being fiercely attacked by our army. Our army has recovered Luodian Town and is attacking the remaining enemy troops in the area of Mujiao Town and Shenjia Bridge, north of Luodian. It is reported that the enemy who landed from Xiaochawukou and attacked Luodian consisted of three regiments in total. In the battle of Luodian Town, the enemy suffered approximately 3,000 casualties. Our army also suffered heavy casualties. Yesterday afternoon (the 26th), our reinforcements continued to arrive and were actively deployed, and a general offensive began last night. According to our military experts, the enemy is attacking this line with all their strength and will certainly resist stubbornly. However, our army has strong strength and high morale, and the remaining enemy troops can definitely be annihilated.

According to refugees who fled from Shanxintang City to Shanghai yesterday, enemy planes have been dropping bombs and bombing everywhere in the area within thirty miles around Luodian, day and night.

Enemy at Shengjia Bridge Defeated and Retreating

Confirmed news: At approximately 9:00 PM last night (the 26th), according to a front-line victory report, the enemy forces retreating and gathering in the Shengjia Bridge area northeast of Luodian were still attempting to put up a stubborn resistance. After a valiant pursuit by the rescue army, they were defeated by our army at around 5:00 PM yesterday evening. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties, and the remaining troops are retreating towards the Shizilin area. Our army is fiercely pursuing them along the river.

About 5,000 Enemy Troops Ashore

According to military information, 30,000 enemy reinforcements arrived at Songkou on the 22nd, and approximately 5,000 of them secretly crossed and landed at Wusong, Zhanghuabang, and Yunzaobang. Among them, 1,500 people have already died in battle or drowned, and the remaining 3,500 are still putting up stubborn resistance. As for the troops gathered at Songkou, they are still trying to continue landing, but have not succeeded. It is also learned that the enemy's secret crossings and landings all took place in the early morning before dawn.

Landing Conspiracy Definitely Cannot Succeed

A spokesperson for a certain military agency stated that this time, the enemy wanted to repeat the "January 28th" incident, landing heavy troops at the estuary in the Wusong area in an attempt to push our flanks. Our army was prepared for this. In recent days, the enemy has been unable to use the power of its artillery fire and aircraft to cover the landing of its main force. However, after landing, it has suffered severe blows and countless casualties. Our army has also seized maps of the combat unit deployment in the pockets of the enemy's senior officers' corpses. All of the enemy's attempts have been completely exposed, so the landing enemy will definitely not succeed.

Enemy at Liuhekou Ultimately Fails

Military news: When the enemy attacked Luodian on the morning of the 25th, enemy traces were also found at the same time in the Liuhekou area. Our garrison troops along the coast immediately responded calmly, and the enemy ultimately failed to succeed. More than ten enemy warships outside the port are still trying to take the opportunity to land. Our army has stepped up its vigilance, with very strong forces, sufficient to repel them.

Remaining Enemy at Zhanghuabang Station Flees in Disarray

Approximately four or five hundred enemy troops at Zhanghuabang Station in Wusong, because they were surrounded by our army and unable to flee back to the enemy warships, are currently trapped in their location, extremely panicked, relying only on the cover of their naval artillery fire in the hope of struggling. Yesterday, on the 26th, at around 8:00 PM, our warships resumed fierce artillery fire, bombarding our army's front lines. A portion of the remaining enemy troops fled towards the Yunzaobang area, hoping to divert our army's forces. I have dispatched a team to encircle them, and fierce fighting is still underway. Wusong was still peaceful yesterday. After the enemy troops in the area from Yunzaobang to Paotaiwan were cleared, there were no continued landings. Our army is still waiting in strict formation. If the enemy comes to attack again, we will definitely give them a head-on blow. Yesterday, there were still more than 300 remaining enemy troops in the Zhanghuabang area, who were scattered everywhere because their retreat had been cut off. Our army is searching for them. A reporter observed yesterday's situation and it seems that the center of the war has shifted from Wusong north to the Chuansha and Liuhe areas. Therefore, there are quite a few enemy troops landing there. However, they landed in a hurry and without any defensive works. Yesterday, our army adopted an encirclement formation, and fierce fighting is still underway.

Enemy Warships Appear Again Off the Coast of Nanhui

Yesterday (the 26th), two or three enemy warships were discovered again off the coast of Nanhui, cruising back and forth all day, attempting to land again. However, because of our army's strict defense, they ultimately failed. Also, near Dayangzhou in Nanhui, according to fishermen's reports, dozens of vessels resembling fishing boats suddenly appeared and disappeared yesterday morning. Whether they are enemy ships is highly questionable.

Enemy Troops at Chuansha Suffer Losses and Retreat

In the Chuansha area, a small number of enemy troops attempted to land near the beach there the day before yesterday, taking advantage of the fierce fighting on all fronts. They were immediately repelled by our army. Before long, enemy reinforcements arrived and resumed their attempts to invade, numbering no less than five or six hundred men. Under the cover of enemy aircraft and heavy artillery fire, they fiercely charged our army's positions. Our army was prepared and immediately counterattacked, turning defense into offense. Both sides engaged in hand-to-hand combat for a long time, and the enemy ultimately suffered losses and retreated. Subsequently, they attacked several times, but all failed. At dawn yesterday morning, the enemy troops were still attempting to launch a sneak attack. Because fierce fighting had occurred, they are currently being annihilated. Also, it is reported that a portion of the enemy troops landed in the Chuansha area the night before last. Our forces are very strong and the defenses are tightly arranged. The enemy troops who landed in the area are now surrounded on three sides, and there was fierce fighting at night. By noon yesterday, they had all been repelled.

Central News Agency: About two or three hundred enemy soldiers landed in Chuansha on the morning of the day before yesterday. Our army immediately fought bravely to meet them, and the fighting was extremely fierce. According to news received this morning, our army surrounded the enemy in the Chuansha area the night before last and is annihilating them.

No Enemy Troops Landed at Zha Pu

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) It has been rumored that enemy troops have landed in the Zha Pu area and that fierce fighting has occurred. Because this newspaper considers the matter to be important, it specifically telegraphed a correspondent in Zha Pu to investigate the truth. We subsequently received a reply stating that Zha Pu is currently extremely peaceful and no enemy troops have landed. It also stated that Zha Pu is the first gateway of Zhejiang Province and that its defense is extremely solid. No matter how stubborn the enemy is, they will definitely not succeed. Last night, a reporter from this newspaper also inquired with a certain military officer who had returned from the front lines, who also denied the matter. According to what he knows, several enemy warships have sailed to a position about fifty nautical miles outside the port of Zha Pu, remotely observing, but are not enough to cause concern.

Minor Contact in Hongkou Area

According to confirmed news from the front line at 8:00 PM last night (the 26th), our army's defenses in the Hongkou area are arranged extremely solidly. In the past two days, the enemy has secretly crossed and landed at places such as Wusong. Therefore, they also frequently used ten squads there to feign attacks against our forces, partly to contain our forces and partly to test our army's defenses. Our army immediately returned fire, and the enemy fled back to their occupied fortifications in a panic. Our army is also strengthening its forces and maintaining strict vigilance. At present, the battle situation is only experiencing minor contact from time to time, and there are no changes in the front lines.

Our Planes Night-Raid and Bomb Enemy Positions

Our air force launched a night raid on enemy warships at approximately 2:00 AM yesterday morning. When our bombers, under the protection of fighter planes, flew over Shanghai, they dropped multiple bombs on enemy warships and positions in the Huangpu River. They then flew to Songkou to bomb enemy warships, causing extremely heavy losses to the enemy. Our planes returned safely after completing their mission.

(Central News Agency) The day before yesterday (the 25th) at approximately 5:00 PM, our army shot down an enemy plane with anti-aircraft machine guns northeast of [unclear character].

Accurate Statistics of Enemy Casualties

Since the outbreak of the "August 13th" incident, it has been two weeks. According to accurate statistics, 3,580 enemy soldiers have been killed and more than 5,000 have been wounded. Our army's officer and soldier casualties are less than half of the enemy's. It is reported that in order to suppress military morale and prevent domestic public opposition, the enemy has always secretly concealed the actual number of dead and wounded soldiers. Most of the enemy's corpses have been disposed of in Shanghai.

Major Fire in Jiading City After Bombing

According to refugees who have just arrived in Shanghai from the Jiading area, enemy planes frequently bomb the Jiading city area. The County Chamber of Commerce area in the city was severely burned due to the enemy dropping incendiary bombs. There were also several fires outside the city. However, order within the city is still good, and most residents have taken refuge elsewhere, so there are no casualties. Luodian was engulfed in another major fire on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 25th), and the entire town was almost completely reduced to scorched earth.

Japan Denies Searching Soviet Consulate

The English-language North China Daily News reported that rumors were rife last night that Japanese soldiers had forcibly entered the Soviet Consulate in Shanghai to search it. This was denied today by the Japanese Embassy. However, it is understood that the Japanese authorities did apply to the Soviet Deputy Consul to investigate the signal lights at Xiamen. The Deputy Consul refused, saying that he must first obtain permission from the Soviet Ambassador.

Yongan Cotton Mill Mortgaged to American Business

The Continental Daily reported that a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy stated a few days ago that the Yongan Cotton Mill in Wusong had presumptuously flown the American flag and allowed Chinese soldiers to lie in ambush inside the factory to attack Japanese soldiers. This was firmly denied last night by Mr. Guo, the general manager of the factory, who said that only two guards were left in the factory. As for why the American flag was flown, it was because the factory was mortgaged to the American company Shenchang Foreign Firm on June 27. It is heard that the American Consul General in Shanghai has informed the Chinese and Japanese military authorities that the factory is now American property and requested that the military be prevented from bombing it. Furthermore, the entire factory has taken out military insurance with an American company.

### Violation of International Conventions, Annihilation of Humanity, Enemy Gunfire Kills Rescue Personnel

Red Cross Announces Details, We Telegraph League to Request Action

The Second Rescue Team of the Chinese Red Cross Society is stationed at the Southeast Medical College in Zhenru, with a Red Cross flag hanging at the entrance and team members wearing armbands. However, at 6:00 AM on August 18, Japanese planes dropped bombs and bombed the college. In addition to the destruction of the buildings in the college, stretcher team leader Zhang Songling was killed, and team leaders Xi Jichang, doctors, and team members Xu Zhende and others were injured. Furthermore, at 11:00 AM on August 19, the Third Rescue Team of the Chinese Red Cross Society in Nanxiang was bombed by Japanese planes, injuring deputy team leader Zhao Ruxin and three team members, and killing two wounded soldiers. Also, the First Rescue Team of the Chinese Red Cross Society stationed in Baoshan and Luodian, consisting of a total of 43 people, all wearing armbands, was working intensely at 4:00 PM on August 23 when they were suddenly confronted by many Japanese soldiers, who forcibly seized their armbands, ordered them to kneel on the ground, and shot them to death. A certain deputy team leader, a famous doctor, three team members, and the wounded soldiers they were rescuing were also shot and killed. Only Bian Minjian, Weng Ruyao, and Wang Fang[unclear character] escaped. Although female student Chen Xiufang, who was seriously injured, was rescued and sent to the Sino-German Hospital, she died of her injuries. The whereabouts of all other team members are unknown. A total of 30 Red Cross Society ambulances are working on the front lines. Car service personnel have repeatedly reported that when Japanese planes see vehicles with Red Cross flags, they drop bombs or use machine guns to strafe them, resulting in the destruction of seven vehicles. The Japanese army dared to bomb and shoot the International Red Cross Society of the American League, which is a violation of international conventions and will cause unease among Red Cross societies around the world. At this moment, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Liu Hongsheng, Lin Kanghou, and others of the association urgently telegraphed Ambassador Wang Zhengting stationed in the United Kingdom to submit this case to the Red Cross League and the World Red Cross Society for strict action.

### Capital's Air Defense is Thorough, Enemy Planes Have No Opportunity

What Mr. Pinino, a Westerner, Said in Shanghai, He Witnessed Six Japanese Planes Being Shot Down

The Da Chen News reported that Mr. Pinino of the Nanjing Music Company arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Beijing and will take his wife back to Beijing next week. According to Mr. Pinino, the capital's air defense is very thorough, so it is safer than Shanghai. Japanese planes arrive in Beijing twice every day, but the damage caused by their bombers is minimal. Before the Japanese planes arrive, the entire city sounds the alarm, so the Japanese planes have no opportunity to take advantage of. He witnessed six Japanese planes being shot down and obtained pieces of the engine and wheels as souvenirs. There is ample food in the city, and only the price of rice has risen by 25%. The prices of other goods have not increased significantly. Almost all foreigners in Beijing have moved away, especially women and children, to places such as Shanghai, Guling, and Hankou. The Beijing-Shanghai railway tracks have not been damaged.

### Japanese Planes Strafe British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, Seriously Injured

Suddenly Encountered Japanese Planes En Route to Shanghai, Vehicle Displayed British Flag But Still Shot At, Spinal Injury, Liver Also Hit, Currently Receiving Treatment at Hong En Hospital

The Central News Agency reported that Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China, was traveling by car from Beijing to Shanghai yesterday when the car was bombed and strafed by Japanese planes 40 to 50 miles from Shanghai, seriously injuring the ambassador. The details are as follows:

Details of the Japanese Plane Strafing

At 11:45 AM yesterday morning, the British Ambassador, accompanied by Military Attaché Fraser and Economic Advisor Bage, traveled from Beijing to Shanghai by road, traveling in two cars. The Ambassador's car was in front, and the car carrying the Military Attaché and others was behind. Both cars had the British flag displayed on the front radiator. At around 2:00 PM, when the cars were 40 to 50 miles from Shanghai, two Japanese planes suddenly flew low from the sky and chased after the Ambassador's car. The first plane immediately opened fire with machine guns, and the driver immediately stopped the car. The other plane continued to drop a bomb, which fortunately landed a little further away and did not destroy the car. At that time, Fraser, Bage, and the driver immediately jumped out of the car and lay on the ground. Because the British Ambassador was slower to move, he was shot by a machine gun as soon as he got out of the car, and was injured.

Ambassador's Injuries Quite Serious

Seeing that their purpose had been achieved, the Japanese planes flew away. Fraser and others quickly helped the Ambassador back into the original car and rushed him to Shanghai. He arrived at 5:10 PM and was immediately taken to Hong En Hospital for treatment, where he was treated by British famous doctors Patton and Gatley. However, the Ambassador's spine was injured and his liver was also hit by bullets. He had lost a lot of blood along the way, so he was given a blood transfusion immediately after arriving at the hospital. He had not yet undergone surgery to remove the bullets by the evening.

Mayor Sends Condolences on Behalf of Chiang

Upon hearing the news of the Ambassador's injury, Mayor Yu immediately sent Secretary Tang Shixuan to the hospital to offer condolences at 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Then, at 7:30 PM in the evening, Yu himself went to the hospital to convey the condolences of Chairman Chiang. Yang Hu, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, also sent someone to the hospital last night at 8:00 PM to express his condolences. It is noted that the British Ambassador came to Beijing from Beidaihe last month after the Lugouqiao Incident to negotiate peace and worked diligently. He came to Shanghai this time and was also planning to mediate for peace, but was instead shot and injured by Japanese planes. People from all walks of life in our country express deep regret and sympathy for the British Ambassador.

British Greatly Indignant

After the news of the British Ambassador being shot by Japanese planes spread, the British side was greatly indignant. It is heard that representatives from the Japanese Embassy in China and Honda, the naval attaché, and representatives from the Third Fleet Commander went to the British Embassy that night to express their apologies.

### Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, British Ambassador

According to doctors, the Ambassador's spinal cord was not severed, and there are no signs of paralysis. The injuries are serious, but there is no immediate danger."

Capital City Residents in Shock

Reuters, Nanjing, 26th Central News Agency: The capital city was shocked after British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was attacked and injured by Japanese planes on the Beijing-Shanghai Highway. Immediately, Yu Ming, the director of the Nanjing Foreign Ministry's Shanghai office, went to Hong En Hospital in Shanghai on behalf of Chairman Chiang and Foreign Minister Wang to offer condolences. The Foreign Minister has also telegraphed British Foreign Secretary Eden to express his regrets.

All of Britain in Uproar

Reuters, London, 26th Central News Agency: Since the news of British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen being attacked and injured by Japanese planes arrived, all of Britain has been in an uproar. All the evening newspapers in London have published this news with large headlines and printed photos taken at the station of the Ambassador and his wife before they left England for China. The public rushed to buy them, showing great concern. However, there has been no official statement so far, and a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom expressed deep regret to Reuters reporters and said that it was particularly regrettable that the British Ambassador was mediating a major mission at this time, preventing him from carrying out his duties. It is noted that Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen is 51 years old and was appointed Ambassador to China in mid-September last year. He previously served as Minister to Iran and Latvia.

Reuters, London, 26th Central News Agency: Politicians and public opinion here are extremely indignant at the news that British Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was attacked and injured by Japanese planes. Regarding this incident, the Foreign Office has not yet received a formal report, and the details are not yet clear. However, politicians believe that even if Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen's life is not in danger, the impact of this incident will not be small.

German Authorities Pay Close Attention

Reuters, Berlin, 26th Central News Agency: Regarding the British Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen being attacked and injured by Japanese planes, newspapers here have recently published it with large headlines, calling it a 'serious incident in Shanghai.' The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung stated, 'This incident will make the situation in the Far East increasingly complicated, but it may not necessarily lead to tragic consequences. It is obvious that Britain has always tried to avoid taking a tough stance against Japan. The escalation of the situation in the Far East is incompatible with the British political program, because the situation in the Mediterranean has not yet calmed down, the United States is unwilling to get involved, and Britain's Eastern policy is not yet ready.' The Berliner Tageblatt stated, 'Since the outbreak of the conflict between China and Japan, the governments of Britain, the United States, and France have been quite anxious and have repeatedly sought to eliminate it. Now that the British Ambassador has been seriously injured, the situation in the Far East will have a rapid evolution, it can be asserted.'

Condition Still Unchanged

Reuters News from this city: Regarding the British Ambassador's condition, the hospital released a message at 11:50, stating that the Ambassador is now able to sleep peacefully and is in very good condition. Also, as of 0:30 this morning, there have been no changes. When the surgery to remove the bullets will be performed is still to be determined by the doctors.

### Violating International Maritime Law, the Enemy Blockades Our Sea Ports

In reality, it has no effect on us; Various countries will lodge serious protests.

Hasegawa, the commander of the Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy in Shanghai, announced the blockade of our southeastern sea ports. A reporter inquired with our country's shipping circles. According to them, this was only seen reported in a certain foreign newspaper in this city. According to the longitude and latitude listed for the blockade area announced by the commander of the Japanese Navy's Third Fleet, it extends from Jiangyin on the Yangtze River, to Wusong in Shanghai, the coastal areas of Zhejiang, Zhenhai in Ningbo, the Zhoushan Islands, the port of Wenzhou, Quanzhou in Fujian, and as far as Shantou and Chaozhou, encompassing the coasts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces. The line from South China to the Yangtze River is also within the blockade range. From the date of the blockade announcement, any Chinese ships encountered within this blockade area will be shelled, and they can be harassed at any time and any place. Our country's shipping circles anticipated this point before the war began. All ships in South China had already stopped sailing on their own, and the Yangtze River even blockaded the Jiangyin port. Therefore, this blockade policy has no impact on us and brings absolutely no benefit to them.

The reporter also visited a person in charge of a certain foreign shipping company. According to them, they had also only seen this reported in foreign newspapers and had not yet received an official notice from the Japanese side. However, since China and Japan have not formally declared war, according to international practice, the Japanese should not rashly blockade Chinese sea ports. Although the currently blockaded area is limited to the section from South China to the mouth of the Yangtze River, many ships from various countries operate within this line. This action by the Japanese clearly violates international norms and hinders the interests of various countries. All countries will lodge a stern protest with the Japanese side.

Regarding the actions of the Japanese Navy at the Wusong port in Shanghai, since the 20th of this month, Chinese ships have been prohibited from traveling to and from there. They have even strictly refused the entry and exit of the refugee transport ships jointly operated by the Municipal Council and the Ningbo Fellow Association. Repeated negotiations have failed to secure permission. Furthermore, from 5:00 PM every day until 8:00 AM the next morning, no foreign ship is allowed to pass through the Wusong port, which is effectively blockaded by the Japanese Navy. This has created various obstacles for foreign ships carrying refugees from Shanghai, causing deep dissatisfaction among various countries, who have also made serious representations to the Japanese side.

### Guo Taiqi's Remarks

Reuters, London, 26th - Guo Taiqi, China's ambassador to the UK, stated to Reuters reporters today that Japan's blockade of Chinese sea ports further proves that Japan, in its large-scale war of aggression against China, is attempting to completely conquer China according to its plan. However, all countries should understand that Japan's goal in China is merely a means to complete its plan, as Japan intends to establish hegemony in the Pacific region after acquiring China's labor and resources. Currently, countries around the world either express their inability to protect their interests or lack the active desire to do so. China alone is exhausting its resources to contend with the strong enemy. China's resistance is not only fighting for its own survival but also upholding justice for all countries in the world directly affected by Japan's lawlessness and ambition. Guo also stated that relevant countries have been unable to prevent Japan from using public concessions as military bases, failing to maintain absolute neutrality, and failing to uphold their treaty obligations to China. Therefore, the current tragic situation in the Far East is caused by the complete disintegration of international law and order, as well as the sanctity of treaties, since Japan seized Manchuria six years ago.

### Serious Repercussions in the US and France

Reuters, Washington, 26th - The United States has taken a serious view of the Japanese Navy's blockade of Chinese sea ports and fears that Japan will find it difficult to draw a line between Chinese and foreign commercial shipping. The New York Times stated that if Japan detains foreign ships, President Roosevelt will find it difficult to avoid declaring a state of war. Havas, Paris, 26th - Lieutenant General Hasegawa, commander of the Second Fleet of the Japanese Navy, issued a declaration in Shanghai yesterday prohibiting Chinese ships from sailing along the coast south of the Yangtze River in China. According to reports here, the Japanese authorities have also claimed that they reserve the right to order foreign ships sailing along the Chinese coast to stop at any time to verify their nationality. Official sources here believe that this statement is unlikely to be reliable. If Japan adopts such an attitude, it will inevitably cause serious international repercussions. Japan may have the right to search Chinese ships, but it certainly cannot search foreign ships. Moreover, according to international maritime law, to implement a blockade, it must be done after a formal declaration of war. Japan must notify all neutral countries before doing so. China and Japan have not formally declared war, and the Japanese government has not notified various countries of the implementation of the blockade.

Havas, Paris, 26th - The right-wing newspaper Figaro recently commented on the Far Eastern situation, "Japan is currently carrying out its planned war in China. This plan may seem unsystematic on the surface, but it has been prepared for a long time. Its purpose in fighting in Shanghai is to undermine the prestige of the Chinese government and prevent China from obtaining military supplies and food from the sea. In short, Japan is determined to control the Shanghai sea port. The reason for the failure of the British government's proposal for the neutralization of Shanghai lies precisely in this. At present, it is virtually impossible to import military supplies and food into China from Shanghai. The key question now is whether Guangzhou will take Shanghai's place. If so, Japanese warships will undoubtedly have to blockade the Pearl River as well. Japan has established naval and air bases in the Penghu Islands, which are not far from Guangzhou. Blockading the Pearl River is not difficult. However, Hong Kong and the Pearl River are as closely related as lips and teeth, and Hong Kong is a fortress and treasury of the British Empire in the Far East. If the Pearl River is blockaded, Hong Kong will also be in dire straits. The consequences of this are likely to be significant."

Hong Kong Merchants Feel Deeply Uneasy

Reuters, Hong Kong, 26th - The Japanese maritime blockade of Chinese ships is considered by business circles here to be the most disturbing development since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, and Hong Kong's commerce is bound to suffer greatly. The English-language "Great American Evening Post" stated that, according to Dr. Shinobo, a legal advisor to the Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy and a professor of international law, although foreign warships cannot be seized, detained, or forced to change their course after the Japanese fleet implements the blockade of Chinese waters, Japanese naval authorities may board ships to verify their nationality if they suspect it. Chinese ships sailing in the prohibited area will be detained, regardless of whether they are carrying munitions or military supplies. Because this is not a wartime blockade, it cannot prevent foreign ships from carrying munitions to China. However, if we discover that foreign ships are carrying wartime contraband, we can take effective measures to exercise pre-emption rights. It was also announced by Japanese authorities to news reporters this morning that Chinese ships captured by Japanese forces would be detained, not confiscated or sunk. As for whether the cargo they carry will be regarded as contraband, a decision has yet to be made. Ships flying foreign flags will not be stopped, and no steps have yet been taken to declare any contraband.

### Encouraging Term Deposit Customers to Subscribe to National Salvation Bonds

The Citizens' Association suggests withdrawing one-tenth of deposits; Overseas Chinese have already remitted 650,000 for bonds

The Second Special District Citizens' Association believes that since the full-scale war of resistance has begun, the government has also decided to issue National Salvation Bonds in order to strengthen its economic power. The association believes that in addition to the methods stipulated by the government, term deposit customers of various banks can be encouraged to allocate one-tenth of their term deposit amount to purchase National Salvation Bonds. This would not result in any loss for the depositors and would be easier to achieve in terms of fundraising. The association has already drafted a plan for this measure and suggested that the government adopt and implement it. It is believed that term deposit customers will also be happy to support it.

It is also reported that the General Committee for Fundraising National Salvation Bonds has only been established for a few days and has already received eleven remittances from overseas Chinese through the Guangdong Bank for underwriting National Salvation Bonds, totaling 650,083 yuan and 47 cents. This is sufficient to demonstrate the patriotism of overseas Chinese.

### National Salvation Bonds with an Annual Interest Rate of Two Percent

Regulations Have Been Submitted for Revision

Since the General Committee for Fundraising National Salvation Bonds has been established, the internal organization has been put in order, and the work is being carried out very diligently. Various banks and postal remittance bureaus in this city have been entrusted to collect funds on its behalf, and branches have been established in various places at home and abroad to raise funds. The regulations have been submitted for revision and have been slightly modified compared to the first draft. The bonds originally had no interest but have now been changed to an annual interest rate of two percent. The regulations are listed below:

Regulations for National Salvation Bonds

Article 1: The National Government, in order to encourage the people to pool their financial resources and contribute to national salvation expenses, issues public bonds, named National Salvation Bonds. Article 2: Any individual or organization that contributes cash or valuable items for national salvation shall be given these bonds according to the amount contributed. Article 3: The total amount of these bonds is 500 million yuan, issued at par value on September 1, 1937. Article 4: These bonds shall have an annual interest rate of two percent, which shall be paid once every year at the end of August, starting from 1938. Article 5: The principal of these bonds shall be repaid starting from 1941, in thirty years. Each year, a lottery shall be drawn to repay the principal. Article 6: The fund for repaying the principal and interest of these bonds shall be allocated by the Ministry of Finance from the national treasury revenue. Article 7: The bonds shall be divided into denominations of 10,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan, 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 10 yuan, and 5 yuan, all of which shall be in bearer form. Article 8: The Ministry of Finance shall entrust an agency to raise funds for these bonds and announce it to the public. Article 9: Anyone who forges these bonds or damages their credit shall be punished by the judicial authorities according to law. Article 10: These regulations shall be implemented from the date of approval.

### Chamber of Commerce Telegram to Hangzhou Hoping for Resumption of Business

Consolidate the rear front; Enhance the strength of the War of Resistance

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Hangzhou Municipal Government and the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce, stating, "Respectfully to Mayor Zhou of the Hangzhou Municipal Government, Chairman Xie of the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce, and all committee members. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Shanghai market once stagnated. Subsequently, our chamber tried every means to persuade and guide the financial, transportation, food, and pawn industries to resume business one after another. Other industries gradually restored order, and people's hearts gradually stabilized. Our chamber's chairman, Yu Xiaolai, also issued a statement hoping that workers and staff would work together in the same boat to reduce unemployment panic, maintain a minimum standard of living, and prepare for a prolonged war of resistance. It is heard that Hangzhou is still stagnant, which is deeply concerning. It is believed that plans for resuming business are already underway, and consolidating the rear front will also enhance the strength of the War of Resistance. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce begs for forgiveness."

### Extremely Tense Situation in Qingdao

Japanese Residents Evacuate in Batches; War Seems Imminent

Qingdao Dispatch: Since the De County Road Incident occurred in this city on the 14th of this month, the atmosphere has been extremely tense, as if a major war is imminent. Citizens are fleeing Qingdao to take refuge, and shops have successively closed. Chinese and foreign factories have also suspended operations. Japanese residents are evacuating in batches, revealing widespread unease and the increasingly perilous state of affairs. The Japanese side's youth groups, veterans associations, reservists, student soldiers, and volunteer corps in Qingdao are taking very active measures, and war seems imminent. A summary of the situation in recent days is compiled below:

Total Evacuation of Japanese Residents

There are approximately 14,000 to 15,000 Japanese residents engaged in business in Qingdao. Adding those who have recently evacuated to Qingdao from the Yangtze River area and Jinan, the total is nearly 20,000. Japanese residents who have evacuated from other ports have been returning to Japan in batches by ship. Japanese residents doing business in Qingdao have recently been ordered to evacuate as well. However, these Japanese residents all have considerable property in Qingdao. Once ordered to cease operations and return to their country, the magnitude of their losses and the problems of their future livelihood are incalculable. Therefore, complaints have arisen, and all express great indignation. Some even weep with grief, steadfastly refusing to return and willing to share the fate of their assets. However, compelled by military orders, they have no choice but to board ships with sorrow. Consequently, tragic events have been frequently reported. According to investigations, the Dalian Maru, Qingdao Maru, and Miura Maru, which sailed from Qingdao to Moji, Japan, on the 9th, carried more than 30 Japanese residents. The Changcheng Maru, Jingguo Maru, Ukishima Maru, Nikko Maru, Kokuryu Maru, Jiao Shan Maru, and Lushan Maru, which departed on the 20th, carried more than 5,000 Japanese residents. It is said that the remaining Japanese residents will be completely evacuated within three days.

Japanese Actively Preparing for War

Since the De County Road Incident occurred, the Japanese consulate has telegraphed its home country, requesting that a large number of warships be sent to Qingdao. The Japanese veterans stationed in Qingdao are all eager to fight, but because of their numerical disadvantage, they have not dared to start a conflict lightly. Currently, there are five Japanese warships in Qingdao, each with approximately 300 to 400 sailors. Recently, the Japanese have repeatedly used Chinese-made trucks to transport extremely heavy wooden boxes, storing them in cotton mills such as Gongda, the Japanese shrine on Liaoning Road, and Japanese shops and residences in the market area. It is said that these wooden boxes are all munitions, unloaded from the wharf and transported to designated locations for storage, in preparation for wartime use. Our municipal authorities have detected their plot and ordered their subordinates to be on strict alert, ready to strike them severely when necessary.

### British Troops Increase Defense on the North Bank of Suzhou Creek

Yesterday at 1:00 PM, the commander of the British troops stationed in Shanghai dispatched soldiers to increase the defense on the north bank of Suzhou Creek. These British soldiers were dressed in dark green uniforms, wore steel helmets, and carried simple luggage. They rode in five trucks, each with approximately 20 to 30 soldiers, led by officers. The trucks drove to the entrance of the First Special District Court on North Zhejiang Road, stopping for a short while. After the location was decided, three trucks of soldiers got off the trucks and lined up to enter the court for garrison. The remaining two trucks then transported materials to the temporary barracks on Ala Bashi Road, Kaifeng Road for rest. At night, all went to the defense lines for guard duty.

### New Timetable for the Beijing-Shanghai Railway

Effective Today

The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau is sparing no effort to maintain transportation. It has been preparing to run Beijing-Hangzhou passenger trains four times in recent days. The trains depart from Shanghai West Station in good order. Yesterday, however, enemy aircraft bombed and damaged the tracks, causing the Shanghai-Hangzhou train scheduled to depart at 8:00 AM to be delayed. An engineering train was dispatched to repair the damage, and the train departed at 4:00 PM. Other trains departed on time. The railway also finalized the Beijing-Shanghai train timetable yesterday, effective today. The details are recorded below: Beijing-Shanghai Express trains operate twice in both directions. Departing from Nanjing at 7:30 AM and 6:00 PM. Departing from Shanghai West at 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM. Beijing-Suzhou Express: Departing from Nanjing at 4:00 PM. Departing from Suzhou at 7:30 AM.

### British Government Determined to Protect Interests in China

Effectively Protect the Lives and Property of British Nationals; Welcomes the U.S. Government's Call for a Ceasefire; Britain, France, and the United States Maintain Close Cooperation

[London] Prime Minister Chamberlain returned to Beijing from Scotland this morning and immediately conferred with Foreign Secretary Eden and Lord President of the Council Halifax on the Shanghai war in the morning. He then held a second conversation at 5:00 PM, which lasted until 6:30 PM. A communiqué was issued afterward stating, "The Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary, and the Lord President of the Council, after discussing the matter, expressed their support for the various measures that the government has already implemented and decided to adopt all effective measures to protect the lives and property of British nationals." The communiqué denied rumors that the British government intended to withdraw all British nationals from Shanghai, and stated, "The government is still working to exclude Shanghai from the war zone. To date, the government has issued notices to both China and Japan, stating that each country will be responsible for any damage to the lives and property of British nationals caused by the war. The government has also protested to the Tokyo government regarding the occupation of British property in the International Settlement by Japanese troops and reserves the right to demand double compensation for damages. In addition, the U.S. government has expressed concern that the war between China and Japan is greatly detrimental to the general situation in the Far East, which is shared in Britain. The U.S. Secretary of State Hull's call for the countries to cease fighting is particularly welcomed by Britain. In short, other countries, especially France and the United States, are closely cooperating with Britain, and Prime Minister Chamberlain and others are very pleased and believe that this cooperation is necessary for continued progress." Chamberlain went to Balmoral tonight to meet with King George VI to report to the King on the situation in the Far East and relations between Britain and Italy.

According to the London Daily Express, Ambassador Lindsay was summoned back home specifically to discuss ways for Anglo-American cooperation on the Far East issue. (National News Agency, 25th)

[New York] Under Secretary of State Welles recently took his family aboard the British mail steamer Queen Mary to Europe. It is said that this trip is a vacation, and he will return home on the 27th of next month.

[London] It is learned that the British authorities in Shanghai have withdrawn 3,500 women and children and 300 men from the country's expatriate community. Currently, there are few British expatriates in Shanghai requesting withdrawal, so there is no need to send more mail ships to Shanghai to welcome the withdrawal of expatriates. (Central News Agency, Havas Dispatch, 26th)

[London] After U.S. Secretary of State Hull made a statement two days ago, urging China and Japan to stop the war, The Times commented, "Although the wording of this statement is very mild, the attitude it expresses is more resolute than some of the public opinion in the country expected. Unfortunately, Japan seems to have decided to stage a tragedy in China, which may not be easily brought to a successful conclusion by Britain and the United States. As far as China's military equipment is concerned, it is far better than in 1932. The country now also has an air force, and although its quantity is not as large as Japan's, its equipment is extremely sophisticated in certain aspects and has achieved great results in various places, especially in Nanjing. In addition, the Su-Er connection has connected the Beijing-Shanghai line with the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. The Chinese military authorities can now use this railway militarily. The invaders must have the power to surround the suburbs of Shanghai in order to control the railway line between Shanghai, Jiaxing, and Suzhou, which is no easy task." (Central News Agency, Havas Dispatch, 26th)

[London] The Times reported that British Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Eden, and Lord President of the Council Halifax discussed the Far East crisis, and it is expected that Japan's invasion of China this month is aimed at monopolizing China. This plan puts the position of all countries, especially Britain, in great danger. Just in Hongkou and Yangshupu, British capital losses have reached 180 million pounds. The report continued that the Sino-Japanese conflict has greatly affected China's customs revenue. Customs revenue is approximately 20 million pounds per year, of which 4.5 million pounds is used to pay interest on Chinese government bonds, and most of these bonds are in the hands of the British. (National Maritime Telegraph, 26th)

[Rome] The Stampa recently commented on the situation between China and Japan, slightly noting that Britain's interests and prestige in the Far East will be greatly affected. "If Japan's plan is indeed aimed at controlling the coastal ports of China, from Tianjin in the north to Guangzhou in the south, including Shanghai, can Britain use appropriate means to deal with this threat? Some say that Britain still hopes to cooperate with the United States, but the evolution of the situation is changing rapidly, and it cannot be resolved by U.S. Secretary of State Hull's call for a ceasefire or President Roosevelt's emphasis on the principle of maintaining the Open Door Policy in China."

### Italian Warships Sail to Shanghai

⊙Genoa: The cruiser Montecuccoli, belonging to the 6th Division of the Second Fleet of the Italian Navy, set sail for Shanghai today to strengthen the Italian Navy's forces in the Far East and protect the lives and property of Italian citizens.

### Britain and the United States Pay Attention to the Situation in Qingdao

Deeply Concerned About the Outbreak of War

[London] The British government is now concerned that the Sino-Japanese war will extend to Qingdao, which will endanger the lives and property of many foreigners there.

The British diplomatic representative in Nanjing has been ordered to express to the Chinese and Japanese authorities that the British government is very concerned about the extension of the war to Qingdao. The British diplomatic representative in China has also been ordered to support U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson. It is heard that Johnson has also made representations to the Chinese authorities regarding the Qingdao matter. (Central News Agency, Reuters Dispatch, 26th)

### Japan Asks Germany for Loans to Buy Munitions

500,000,000 Yuan

[Berlin] German business circles are now hoping to receive a large number of orders from Japan. According to German export merchants, the Japanese government has requested Germany to lend 500 million yen, equivalent to approximately 400 million marks, to be used to purchase military supplies from Germany. If this transaction is successful, the losses suffered by German trade with China since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict will be compensated. In the first half of 1937, Chinese goods imported into Germany amounted to more than 41 million marks, while German goods exported to China amounted to approximately 78 million marks. It is expected that the losses in German trade with China in the second half of this year will be very large. Until recently, German ships sailing to the Far East loaded and unloaded half of their import and export goods in Shanghai. However, German shipping companies have ordered these ships not to stop in Shanghai anymore, but to stop in Hong Kong and Tianjin instead, because Germany believes that Shanghai has now been blocked or blockaded by the Japanese military. Moreover, after the Chinese market is closed, Germany can no longer import various raw materials from China, especially metals. Therefore, Germany has had to purchase raw materials from other countries at higher prices. (Central News Agency, Havas Dispatch, 25th)

### There Are Still More Than 60,000 Refugees in Shanghai

Urgently Need Relief and Repatriation

Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, refugees have flocked to the concessions. The Shanghai Relief Committee and other fellow-provincial associations have been receiving and repatriating them separately. How many refugees are there as of now? This survey is extremely important. According to a reporter's investigation yesterday, the Ningbo Association in Shanghai still has more than 7,000 people besides those who have been repatriated. Other fellow-provincial associations, such as those from Shaoxing, Yuyao, Jiangyin, Wuxi, Haining, Tongzhou, Rugao, Chongming, Hai'an, Qidong, and the seven counties of Yangzhou, have received more than 20,000 people. The Municipal Relief Committee has received a total of 19,316 people. Including those scattered on the streets and at the wharves, there should be no less than 5,000 to 6,000. In total, there are approximately 60,000 refugees in Shanghai. How to enable them to return to their hometowns is indeed a major problem.

### Mayor Yu's Wife Offers Condolences and Raises Funds

Notice from the Municipal Police Bureau

Once the war is over, the government will be requested to provide appropriate compensation to show sympathy. However, it has been repeatedly reported that recently, in various districts under the bureau's jurisdiction, local thugs have been falsely using the names of the police and local teams to privately requisition military supplies, taking the opportunity to defraud property. Such reckless behavior is extremely hateful. In addition to strictly ordering subordinates to arrest and hand over such individuals at any time, citizens who discover the above situation should immediately report it to the bureau. Once verified, they will be severely punished. This notice is hereby issued for general information.

### Belgian Ambassador to China Arrives in Shanghai

The association then dispatched staff to accompany the reporters to visit six relief hospitals, including the Commodities Exchange, Xiaoming Girls' High School, the Catholic Church, Aurora University, the Poor People's Education Center, and the Vienna Garden Ballroom. The gates of each hospital were heavily guarded, and the order was good. After explaining the situation to the hosts, they inspected each ward for a week. Due to time constraints, they could not stay long. The wounds of the wounded soldiers in each hospital were still light. The Vienna ward was located in the ballroom, and the light and air were good. Some patients were sitting quietly on the grass to enjoy the cool. The place was jointly operated by the Machinery Association and the National Businessmen's Association, and the supplies were adequate, and there were many service personnel, including many dancers, who were responsible for nursing. Their patriotic sincerity was admirable. The Catholic Church and Aurora University both had well-equipped operating rooms. When the reporters visited, they were performing surgeries, so they did not stay long for fear of hindering the surgeries. The lives of the wounded soldiers were very disciplined. Nurses provided newspapers and wrote letters for them, giving them a lot of spiritual comfort. In order to maintain their orderly lives, the association politely declined external condolence gifts and excessive services, believing that more spiritual comfort should be given to the wounded soldiers.

### Military Law Strictly Punishes Profiteering Rice Merchants

Proclamation by the Martial Law Headquarters

Yang Hu, the Martial Law Commander of Shanghai, recently issued Proclamation No. 17, stating that: "The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's Letter No. 78 stated that, 'Since the outbreak of the war in this city, regarding the issue of public food, the bureau has jointly organized the Shanghai Citizens' Adjustment Committee with the city's military and police organs, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, local associations, the Banking Association, and various rice industry groups to comprehensively plan and sell at fair prices to maintain public food.

### Yunnan Fellow-Provincials Register to Be Sent Back Home

Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, air routes have been cut off, and remittances are not possible. Yunnan fellow-provincials in Shanghai (including students) are looking forward to Kunming, separated by thousands of miles, and their calls for help have not been answered. The future is particularly worrying. Yesterday, I met with a person in charge of the general affairs section of the Yunnan Fellow-Provincial Association in Shanghai. According to him, the association is preparing to provide funds for fellow-provincials in Shanghai to return home and has contacted a British shipping company to book berths. It is hoped that all fellow-provincials will quickly register with Mr. Chen Jincan at the Comfort Goods Collection Point of the Anti-Japanese Support Association of Guangxia Middle School at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Moore Road within two days in order to prepare berths and depart as soon as possible. Late registration will not be accepted.

Fortunately, He Had Life Insurance; Able to Provide for Life and Death

Mr. Zhu Gongquan, manager of the American-funded Meifeng Textile Company in this city, died at 4:00 PM on the 14th of this month. While driving his private car on official business in front of the Great World on Edward Avenue, he was hit by a bomb dropped from an airplane, severing his left leg. He was sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment, but he died two hours later due to his injuries. Mr. Zhu originally lived on Gongping Road in Hongkou. Only after the outbreak of the war in Shanghai did he escape with his family and reside in the French Concession. Unfortunately, he encountered this disaster. Moreover, Mr. Zhu had parents over 70 years old and a wife and five children, whose education and upbringing required funds. Fortunately, Mr. Zhu had a life insurance policy of 10,000 yuan with the Huaan Mutual Aid Insurance Company. After the incident, the company investigated and verified the facts. Mr. Zhu's family has received the full amount of compensation, which can be used to provide for life and death. The family is grateful for this benefit and has published a thank-you note to the company in the newspaper.

### Yenching University Establishes a Liaison Office in Shanghai

Since the Japanese army invaded Peiping and Tianjin and postal and telegraph communications were cut off, the situation at Yenching University has been unknown here. It is learned that Mr. Xie Jingsheng, secretary of the university, established a temporary liaison office of Yenching University in Shanghai at 319, near the intersection of Maixi Ai Road and Huanlong Road in the French Concession, in view of the increasing number of Yenching University teachers and students coming to Shanghai.

### News from Hui Qun Girls' School

The Hui Qun Girls' Primary and Secondary School and Kindergarten in Tilanqiao were completely destroyed on the 10th of this month. Principal Wang, considering that the original 500 students were scattered in the British and French Concessions, and in order to facilitate the students' collection of graduation certificates, transfer certificates, and study loan certificates, has negotiated with the Hua Dong Republic Girls' School in the British and French Concessions to borrow a place to study. Students can enter the designated school to study with a study loan certificate without having to go through an entrance examination, which is the same as entering the original school. It is very convenient. A temporary office has been set up at 500 Luban Road, Pubo Road in the French Concession. The school's students can contact them as soon as possible so that their studies will not be affected.

### The Enemy Employs Full Force to Attack Coastal Ports along the Yangtze, Our Army and Air Force Launch a Large-Scale Encirclement

Our forces are heavily garrisoned at various points along the coast, vowing to annihilate the stubborn enemy in the shortest possible time.

The battle situation for the past two days has remained focused on various ports along the Yangtze River and the coast, especially the Liuhang and Luodian areas, which are the most critical. The situation is as follows: ㊀ Nanhui and Chuansha are clear of enemy traces. ㊁ Along the Wusong town, Zhanghuabang, Wenzaobang and along the Huangpu River, there are still a few remnants of the enemy, resisting stubbornly under the encirclement of our army. ㊂ Between the northeast coast of Luodian and Liuhang, a significant number of enemy troops continue to land, attempting to break through our lines of defense with all their strength in that area, in order to relieve the siege of Shanghai. Our forces are now heavily garrisoned at various points along the coast, having encircled the enemy, and aiming to annihilate the stubborn enemy in a short period of time.

According to the Central News Agency, as per reports received from the front lines this afternoon, the enemy troops who landed at various coastal ports earlier, except for a few remnants in the Zhanghuabang and the Shenqiao, Mujiaoqiao and Chenjiahang areas northwest of Luodian, are being cleared. The rest of the areas are clear of enemy traces. As for the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas, they are very calm and there is no intense fighting. The battle lines on both sides have also remained unchanged.

### Our Air Force Launches Bombing Raids

According to reliable information from military authorities, our air force dispatched dozens of aircraft this morning to launch large-scale bombing raids in order to assist our army's general offensive.

### Enemy Troops Continue to Land at Liuhang

Dozens of enemy ships unleash fierce artillery fire.

According to those who returned to Shanghai from the front lines at 3:00 AM this morning, the enemy troops in the Luodian area, after being besieged by our army for two days and nights, have retreated to an area approximately eight or nine *hua li* outside Luodian town. They continued to resist stubbornly last night and this morning. At the same time, dozens of enemy ships unleashed intense artillery fire from Paotaiwan along the riverbanks of Baoshan, Shizilin, Xiaochuansha, and Liuhang, providing cover for furtive landings at various locations.

### Part of the Enemy Force Lands at the Mouth of Wusong

Our forces concentrate firepower for sweeping fire; fierce fighting continues until noon.

According to confirmed reports, part of the enemy force landed at the mouth of Wusong at approximately 2:00 AM this morning. Our forces immediately concentrated firepower and engaged in brave sweeping fire. Fierce fighting continued until noon.

In the Wusong area, several hundred enemy remnants are entrenched in the area east of the town along the banks of the river, while our forces are on high alert west of the town, awaiting the opportunity to advance and annihilate them.

### No Enemy Traces Northeast of Luodian

Approximately Two Thousand People Still in Northwest Area

According to Wang Yuwu, the District Chief of Luodian who arrived in Shanghai from the south at 10:00 AM today (the 27th), there are no enemy traces northeast of Luodian. In the Shenqiao, Mujiaozhen and Chenjiahang area northwest of Luodian, there are still approximately two thousand enemy troops, who are currently encircled by our forces. In the Xiaochuansha area, the enemy seems to be constructing fortifications, hoping to resist stubbornly, but judging by the terrain there, the enemy will definitely not succeed. In the previous few days, the enemy advanced into Luodian town in two routes. The front lines saw a small number of enemy troops advance to the Shi Xiang Gong Temple in Jiading County, but after being encircled and attacked by our rear forces, the enemy was unable to hold and retreated. In terms of the current situation, the enemy in that area can be completely annihilated in the shortest possible time.

### Enemy Remnants at Wenzaobang Plan Stubborn Resistance

Enemy ships on the river use the power of the rising tide to suppress our army's position with artillery fire.

The fighting between the two sides has been quite fierce in the coastal area in recent days, with incessant artillery fire day and night. The air force has also been deployed to assist in the battle. According to reliable information, there are still more than a thousand enemy troops in the Lianglu Bureau factory and station north of Wenzaobang, along the railway, resisting stubbornly and attempting to penetrate further. However, our side has long deployed heavy troops there, and the enemy is already encircled. However, due to the terrain, the enemy ships anchored on the river surface often take advantage of the rising tide to suppress our positions with artillery fire. Therefore, our side is waiting calmly, awaiting the opportunity to annihilate them in one fell swoop, which will not be difficult.

According to another report, only a few hundred enemy remnants remain in the Zhanghuabang area, scattered widely throughout various places, and will soon be cleared. In the Wenzaobang to Wusong area, enemy corpses are everywhere, piled up like small hills.

### Enemy Plans to Re-attack Nanhui and Chuansha

Our side is on strict guard, leaving no room for exploitation.

The enemy troops who landed at Nanhui and Chuansha have been completely cleared by us. Yesterday afternoon, it was reported that many enemy ships and merchant ships were spotted on the sea northeast of Nanhui, with wooden planks prepared, seemingly intending to land again. Our side is on strict guard and there is absolutely nothing to worry about.

### Enemy Troops Launch Repeated Counterattacks in Eastern Shanghai

They are beaten back and scattered by our army; harassment continues all night without success.

The enemy troops along North Sichuan Road, Jiangwan Road, and Yangshupu Road west of the Gongsida Yarn Factory launched counterattacks against our army's positions along that line last night, taking advantage of the arrival of their reinforcements. Our army also launched a counterattack along the entire line. The enemy troops, seeing that we were prepared, retreated immediately, but soon returned, only to be beaten back again by our army. The harassment continued all night, but was ultimately unsuccessful. At Shanghai University, our army's front lines are only five hundred [units of measurement missing] away from the northern [enemy position]. The two sides are locked in a stalemate.

### Enemy Aircraft Cause Disturbance in All Directions This Morning

Reconnaissance over Nanshi and Pudong

At dawn this morning, enemy aircraft were out causing disturbances in all directions again. The grinding noise reflected the barbaric behavior of the aggressors. They initially flew around the Xuhui area, and then around 9:00 AM, they flew over Pudong and Nanshi for reconnaissance, attempting to bomb.

Also, a report states that at around 7:00 AM today, a squadron of Japanese aircraft flew over Pudong, randomly dropping bombs and strafing downwards with machine guns. A small number of innocent civilians were hit and killed or injured. This inhuman act by enemy aircraft is likely due to their attempts to spy on Pudong failing, and they are therefore venting their anger through this cruel behavior. However, our army has not suffered any damage.

According to intelligence obtained yesterday, enemy aircraft will carry out large-scale bombing of Nanshi, Wusong, and Yangshupu today, but as of noon today, no large-scale bombing by enemy aircraft has occurred. Only three enemy aircraft circled over Nanshi and Pudong for reconnaissance starting at 8:00 AM this morning, and strafed our police maintaining order at the Guanzhao Bridge of the 16th Division with machine guns, leaving after approximately two hours.

### Nissin Warehouse Catches Fire After Being Hit

Losses Exceed Half After Two Major Fires

The Nissin Company warehouse in Zhangjiabang, Pudong, was hit again by shelling and caught fire at approximately 9:00 AM this morning. The flames were fierce, and thick smoke swept northward across the Huangpu River with the wind. The fire continued to burn until noon and has not been extinguished. The building was stacked with large quantities of flour and grains. After two major fires, more than half of the warehouse and goods have been lost.

### Japanese Aircraft Deliberately Bomb Nantong Christian Hospital

More Than Thirty Teachers and Patients Die; Chongying Girls' School of the American Church is also Bombed

[Nanjing] According to reports from Nantong recently received by Director Liu of the Department of Health, the Japanese aircraft bombed the Nantong Christian Hospital established by the American Church. On the morning of August 17, at 9:00 AM, ten Japanese aircraft appeared over Nantong and dropped six bombs on the Nantong Christian Hospital and its surroundings. One bomb went directly into the hospital ward, immediately exploding and catching fire, completely destroying the ward. It is known that Lin, a female doctor, Wang, a trainee doctor, two nurses, four workers, and more than thirty patients died. The number of injured patients and hospital staff is still under investigation. Another bomb fell on the residence of Pastor Pool, completely destroying it. Fortunately, Mr. and Mrs. Pool had left Nantong two days earlier. The third bomb fell on Chongying Girls' School, established by the American Church, completely destroying the school's newly completed gymnasium. The other bombs all fell near the hospital. Two hospital residences have collapsed, and the exact number of damaged houses is not yet clear. The site of the Christian Hospital is located in the suburbs of Nantong. There are no factories, airfields, or other military facilities nearby. The Japanese aircraft's bombing was definitely not due to error, but a deliberate destruction of a charitable organization. There are still two American nurses in the hospital, Ms. Chuan Rui and Ms. Mai Wenke, both of whom were slightly injured. According to recent reports, these two American female nurses are still working on rescue efforts in Nantong. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 26th)

### Shanghai Municipal Council Pays Attention to Refugee Hygiene

Vaccination and Establishment of Isolation Hospitals; Dispatching Personnel to Instruct on Necessary Hygiene Methods

According to the investigation by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, there are currently as many as ninety-three refugee shelters within the Settlement. Their sizes vary, and they accommodate over 100,000 refugees. In addition to working with the authorities to find ways to transport refugees out, the Council also believes that the hygiene of these refugees is extremely important. Therefore, it has specifically instructed the Health Department to vaccinate the refugees at each shelter. In recent days, approximately 3,000 people have been vaccinated. The Council is also concerned about refugees suffering from infectious diseases, so it has established an isolation hospital, and the hospital is working to expand daily. Personnel have also been sent to various shelters to instruct on all necessary hygiene methods. In the future, if new shelters are established, the Council will ensure that hygiene is as complete as possible.

### British Public Opinion Extremely Indignant Over the Incident of Japanese Aircraft Shooting the British Ambassador

US Secretary of State Hull Sends Condolences to Britain; Ambassador Receives Blood Transfusion This Morning with Good Results

Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador, was wounded by Japanese aircraft strafing with machine guns at low altitude at approximately 2:00 PM yesterday on the highway from Nanjing to Shanghai, about fifty miles from Shanghai. His military attaché, Fraser, personally drove the original car at high speed to Shanghai and sent him to Hong'en Hospital, where he was admitted to room 310. Famous doctors Gautenaar and Patton were put in charge of the treatment. As the Ambassador had lost a lot of blood along the way, a blood transfusion was performed immediately that evening. At that time, many British residents and soldiers volunteered to donate. After Dr. Gautenaar's examination and consideration, it was decided that one of the British soldiers who volunteered was the most suitable, and the transfusion was performed immediately for the Ambassador. The procedure went well that evening. According to the examination report at 8:30 AM this morning, the Ambassador had a slightly elevated temperature last night and felt a little uneasy, but he calmed down quickly, so there was no cause for concern. Afterwards, the symptoms were unchanged, the progress was good, and it was very satisfactory. The body temperature and pulse also did not increase, so the Ambassador is now feeling quite comfortable mentally, and there is no need to worry too much about the injury. It was later learned that the attending doctors felt the Ambassador was too deficient in blood, and even after a blood transfusion last night, it was still not enough, so they called another British soldier to continue the blood transfusion this morning. According to news at 1:00 PM this afternoon, the procedure went very well. As for performing surgery to remove the bullet, it will depend on the Ambassador's health in two or three days.

### Our Country's Authorities Shocked and Saddened

Central News Agency Nanjing, 26th. When the authorities of our country learned that British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was shot and injured by Japanese aircraft near Wuxi, they all expressed shock and regret. After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received an official report from the British Embassy, it immediately ordered Yu Ming, the Director of the Ministry's office in Shanghai, to go to the Hong'en Hospital where the British Ambassador was staying to express condolences on behalf of Chairman Chiang and Minister Wang. Minister Wang also sent a telegram to British Foreign Secretary Eden expressing his condolences. According to the official announcement by the British Embassy, at 2:30 PM this afternoon, the car carrying the British Ambassador, flying the British flag, was bombed by two Japanese aircraft with bombs and machine guns at a location 100 kilometers from Wuxi. The British Ambassador was injured in the stomach and spine.

### Britain to Take Appropriate Measures

[London] The British Foreign Office has just issued a statement stating that the British government is deeply concerned about the news that British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was strafed and shot by Japanese forces. The British government is currently seeking some details that it requires. Once this information is received, the British government can take appropriate measures toward the Japanese government. According to the report received by the government, the car carrying the British Ambassador was flying the British flag and was attacked by two Japanese aircraft with machine guns and bombs at approximately 2:30 PM. The British Ambassador was seriously injured and is currently in a hospital in Shanghai. British military attaché Lieutenant Colonel Fraser and financial advisor Bage, who were in the same car, are reportedly uninjured. At the same time, although the statement that the Japanese authorities in Shanghai have expressed their apology to the British Acting Consul-General is considered satisfactory by many, the British government had previously notified both China and Japan that China and Japan must be held responsible for any losses suffered by British lives and property due to the war. Even if the bombing of the British Ambassador was accidental, the indiscriminate bombing of civilian vehicles in the absence of a declaration of war is to be condemned. The news of the British Ambassador's injury arrived in London before noon, and those who heard it were greatly shocked. The evening papers did not contain much detail, as the telegrams from China were neither detailed nor consistent. The British public later learned that there was no question of the Japanese deliberately bombing the British Ambassador, but the location of the car was on the highway from Nanjing to Shanghai, no less than fifty miles away from the area where the Chinese and Japanese troops were fighting. Since a state of war between the Chinese and Japanese governments had not been declared, what was the justification for indiscriminately attacking vehicles traveling on the highway? This is extremely puzzling. Judging from the statement, the British government will take action only after investigating the details of the matter. It is heard that the British Ambassador's wife and two daughters are currently vacationing in Beidaihe, and the British officials there have immediately notified them of this unfortunate event. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 27th)

### US Secretary of State Sends Condolences to Britain

Central News Agency Washington, 26th, Reuters dispatch. US Secretary of State Hull telegraphed the British government today to express his sadness and condolences over the injury of the British Ambassador. Hull called this an extremely regrettable and unfortunate event. Many believe that this incident proves the dangers faced by neutrals in the war zone and may strengthen the argument for all Americans to leave Shanghai. Hull met with President Roosevelt today to discuss recent developments, and the President then attended a cabinet meeting. According to news from cabinet members, the US President only described the current situation in the Far East in detail and has not made any decisions.

### London Public Opinion Extremely Outraged

Central News Agency London, 26th, Havas dispatch. After British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was wounded by Japanese aircraft using machine guns today, the official authorities have not commented on it, but public opinion in general is extremely indignant. It is widely believed that the British government had previously warned both China and Japan that each country would be directly responsible for any actions that harmed the safety or property of British citizens. Therefore, Japan cannot shirk responsibility for this incident. Political figures say that in legal terms, there is currently no state of war in China. If Japan merely uses the excuse that travel near the war zone is not advisable and bombs cars carrying non-military personnel with aircraft, its crime cannot be excused. Moreover, the area where the Japanese army is fighting is not its own territory, but belongs to China, which maintains diplomatic relations with the Tokyo government. How can the Japanese army act arbitrarily? The general public believes that the actions that the British government should take in the future regarding the injury of Ambassador Hughe should be based, in part, on the above views.

### Japan Uses Poison Gas Against Our Army After Failing in Nankou

Our Army Still Resisting Firmly

[Nanjing] According to a statement by the Supreme Military Authority today, after the Japanese army repeatedly failed to attack Nankou, they released poison gas against the soldiers of the Chinese 89th Division on the 24th and 25th of this month. However, the division is still resisting to the best of its ability. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 26th)

### Britain Considers the Enemy's Blockade of Our Coast Illegal

US Authorities Will Not Tolerate Interference with US Shipping

[London] The British Foreign Office has not yet received any official notification from Japan regarding the blockade of the South China coast. It is heard that a legitimate state of war definitely does not exist, and Britain has no question of recognizing the blockade, just as the British government has not recognized the blockade of the Spanish coast declared by Spanish Nationalist leader Franco. If Japan does not demand the right to stop and inspect British ships, then Britain will not be affected in any way. So far, Japan has not hinted at any intention to search British ships (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 27th).

[Washington] Regarding the decision by the Japanese Third Fleet to blockade the southeastern coast of China, the US State Department has refused to comment, believing that the matter has not yet been officially raised with the US government and it is not appropriate to express an opinion hastily. However, sources familiar with the matter believe that if US maritime transportation is interfered with arbitrarily by Japan, it will definitely not be tolerated by President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull. Therefore, if Japan does not formally declare war on China and attempts to blockade the country's coast, it will inevitably put itself in an extremely difficult position. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 27th)

### Enemy Aircraft Drop Bombs in Fujian and Jiangxi

[Fuzhou] Three enemy aircraft flew low over the northwest countryside of the province at 4:30 AM this morning, conducting reconnaissance for several weeks, before flying north. Enemy aircraft have been passing through Fuqing for several days, and there have been reports of bombings in Meizhou, Putian. Yesterday, enemy aircraft moored in Matan Ao strafed the Gongzheng, a civilian ship entering the port, injuring a ship steward and a passenger each. All parties are indignant (Special dispatch on the 26th).

[Nanchang] At 2:00 AM on the 26th, enemy aircraft attacked Jiangxi again. The city's air defense agencies reported the attack in advance, and the police and soldiers were mobilized and put on alert. When multiple enemy aircraft flew to Leping, our air force took off to intercept them, and the enemy aircraft scattered in panic. Only three aircraft penetrated into Nanchang's airspace at 2:20 AM, flying very high. After being heavily bombarded by our anti-aircraft guns, they hastily dropped more than a dozen bombs, causing slight damage to houses and residents, before escaping at 3:00 AM. The alert was immediately lifted (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th).

[Nanjing] Four enemy aircraft flew to Anting and Qingyanggang along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway at 7:35 AM on the 26th and dropped bombs, resulting in several station employees being injured and slight damage to the tracks (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th).

### Sichuan and Shaanxi Goods Rerouted for Export

[Chongqing] Due to the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the export of goods from Sichuan and Shaanxi has been suspended for ten days. Goods transported by Yangtze River steamers to Wuhan will be rerouted through the Guangdong-Hankou Railway for sale in Hong Kong. Exporters have already drafted measures for rerouting goods for export and paying taxes, and have submitted them to the Finance and Special Affairs Department of the Headquarters for review. (Special dispatch on the 26th)

### Our Army Reaches Dahu Village on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway

Enemy Troops at Huifeng Bridge Have Been Eliminated; Japanese Troops Loot Shops in Jinghai City; Zhangbei Is Heavily Encircled by Our Army

[Nanjing] Our army is attacking the enemy's rear on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. After the Japanese troops withdrew from Duliu Town, several regiments of our army advanced to Dahu Village, eighteen *li* northeast of Chen Guantun. A major battle is expected tonight. The enemy attacking Huifeng Bridge on the right flank has been eliminated. In Jinghai City, over three hundred enemy troops looted the shops and compiled bandits into the [ranks] and issued ridiculous proclamations. (Special dispatch on the 26th)

[Guihua] Zhangbei has been heavily encircled by our army, cutting off the enemy's communication. The enemy is urgently increasing reinforcements from the direction of Dolon, and fierce fighting is expected within days. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)

[Tianjin] The Tianjin airfield is currently flooded, so the Japanese army cannot utilize the thirty aircraft stationed there. Hundreds of Chinese workers are currently pumping water out of the airfield day and night. The Wen'anwa area south of Tianjin has become a swamp, and the workers who made bricks and tiles have all fled. Residents of Jinghai are taking small boats to Tianjin to avoid the bombing by Japanese artillery. It is said that banditry is rampant along the Grand Canal due to the absence of police. Tianjin-Pukou Railway trains currently run as far north as Tangguantun north of Machang (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th).

### Miscellaneous Comments

— Xiang

Regarding Japan's blockade of our country's coastal ports, regardless of the impact this has on our country or the benefits it has for the enemy, according to international maritime law, in order to implement a blockade, ㊀ there must be a formal declaration of war, and ㊁ all neutral countries must be notified in advance. Although there have been so-called "accidental incidents" between China and Japan, there has been no formal declaration of war, and we have not heard of any notifications to neutral countries. Alas, all the treaties and regulations of international law have been trampled on by Japan.

We were greatly surprised that British Ambassador Dr. Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was ambushed by enemy aircraft on the way from Beijing to Shanghai yesterday and suffered serious injuries. As to whether this is enough to cause unease among the British and what attitude Britain should take towards Japan, I am unwilling to comment on these matters. However, Japan's inhuman behavior has been fully demonstrated to the world, so what else can be said about the killing of Red Cross relief workers?

### A Record of Beiping After Song Zheyuan's Withdrawal

— Cao Shi

Every morning, two lepers deliver newspapers in the apartment. The bigger one delivers the small newspapers, and the smaller one delivers the big newspapers. Since the withdrawal of the 29th Army, Beiping has been like a dead city. Aside from counter-propaganda, the theories of the traitors are gradually gaining ground! The newspaper delivery men have more dealings with the newspaper offices, and they know some news that the newspapers dare not publish. Around 7 o'clock, the mine entrance is crowded with people waiting for the newspaper, mostly students or government employees, looking at each other with sighs, gloomy and silent. Therefore, in recent days, the citizens have been saying with one voice: the academic community is the most excited and the most disheartened. Yesterday (August 6th), the daily newspaper carried the news that General Feng Yuxiang would broadcast at 8 PM. This news quickly entered everyone's heart. After dinner, strolling on the street, the first thing acquaintances say when they meet is: "Let's see what Old Feng has to say today. Can such a population in two major cities really be taken away so easily with just a scare?" The storefronts with radios are more bustling than ever since the incident. The police have also temporarily increased! "Old," "young," "male," "female," "shop assistants, bosses," wearing long gowns and short jackets, in groups of three or twos, are talking and discussing. The sidewalks in front of many stores are impassable!

Twenty minutes past 8, the radio is still crackling with strange electrical interference, and there is commotion in the crowd! The sounds of feet being stepped on and scraped follow one another. Disappointment is written on everyone's faces. In the heavy footsteps, people gradually disperse, and the shops return to their former quietness. The police also walk away listlessly. "Damn it, the devils are doing mischief again! Alas! I don't know if the government has any solutions now?" These vague and weary conversations can often be heard in the dispersing crowd.

A group of people surrounded the bigger leper. Yesterday, the bigger leper heard the Nanjing broadcast at the Drum Tower. Feng Yuxiang said: "There is a bumper harvest in North China this year. The mobilization order will be issued after autumn. We will fight to the end, even if we have only one soldier and one soldier left." "Good! Damn, Old Feng is really a man, dares to speak hard words!" This is the apartment's tea room boy's praise after slapping his thigh. The bigger leper's small newspaper is sold out immediately. The smaller leper pushed his bicycle in. "How is it? Does the smaller leper have any news?" Again, people are grabbing newspapers while asking, "The people in the office said: There is military action in Chengde, and Japanese soldiers are heading north every day." Then there is a burst of joyful laughter. "Can't read it! Damn traitor newspaper is spreading rumors!" A pile of newly torn newspapers fell to the ground!

Depression envelops the entire Beiping. It's really a miracle! The transportation lines of Tianjin and Beiping are controlled by Japan, yet they still talk about the final juncture, withdrawing troops from Beiping in order to "sparing the people from suffering." Such good slogans cannot cover up the iron-clad historical evidence. The 1.5 million people became "turtles in a jar" after Song Zheyuan left! Seeking peace from tigers and wolves is increasing the enemy's courage. We should thank the Japanese for their diplomatic considerations. Beiping city is spared from suffering, but the people in the four suburbs are suffering. Immediately after the Tongzhou Security Team revolted, there was a massacre. When will the hatred between nations end! The gunshots of the 29th Army's retreat alarmed the patriotism of the Security Team. Tongzhou was recovered in an instant, but who knew that this great force was sacrificed because there were no reinforcements! The Japanese reinforcements arrived! The Security Team could not defend the city alone. Beiping was attacked by the Japanese from the front and rear, suffering heavy losses. The painstaking efforts of enduring humiliation and bearing shame for several years to deceive the enemy were wasted! How great is this power, and how rare is the opportunity? Tight organization and detailed planning are indispensable at this critical juncture. The survival of the nation is at stake, yet can there be suspicion within our own ranks? The country is in danger! We should rise up, the government officials should quickly correct their past mistakes, and the local authorities should also "think deeply after the pain"! Beiping was sacrificed due to several shortcomings: "self-suspicion," "loose organization," and "incomplete planning"!

The Chinese nation will surely be revived. After the Lugou Bridge Incident, the strong national consciousness and popular sentiment in Beiping, the dedication of the soldiers and the nervousness of the people are the main foundations of the great cause of the Chinese nation's restoration. But this requires the whole country to unite and rise up together! Do not be suspicious! Do not create internal strife! Although we are in a dangerous city, we are not anxious. The people of Beiping are always ready to respond to China's self-defense war tomorrow!

### The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army in Chahar Province Suddenly Recaptures Taomiao Village

Advancing towards Chongli and Duolun in separate directions. The Anti-Japanese Army's five routes are gaining momentum. The bandits and puppets' economy is extremely uneasy.

A communication from Zhangjiakou: In recent days, the Japanese army has repeatedly used a small number of airplanes to spy on Zhangjiakou and actively deployed the puppet army in the Hebei-Chahar region, drawing them to the so-called suitable areas. Regular Japanese divisions are also attacking our Nankou in separate directions and preparing to attack our Chahar-Suiyuan area. At this time, when the enemy is deeply invading and the national crisis is serious, a passionate civilian army took the opportunity to recover villages such as Taomiao and Shizuizi. The county seat of Chongli is also showing signs of being recaptured. The battle situation on each route and the process of recovering Taomiao, as well as the internal situation of the civilian army, are described below.

Taomiao Village in Chongli County, Chahar Province, which has been occupied for years, was suddenly recaptured at 2:00 AM on the 11th of this month by righteous people Qiao Jianzhong, Yang Zhensheng, Zhang Jinsheng, Cao Fatong, and Bu Ziqian of the People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Brigade. At that time, they had a fierce battle with the puppet Mongolian Security Team stationed in the village for an hour, killing Imaeda Uichiro, the Japanese instructor of the puppet supervision office, on the spot, and capturing one puppet Mongolian Security Team member, more than ten horses, and more than eighty rifles. Because Ma Zilong, the puppet police chief of Taomiao, and patrol officer Ao Yupu had previously contacted the civilian army to defect and vowed to serve the country, the local order was temporarily maintained by Shan Ma and others. On the 12th, villages near Taomiao such as Shizuizi and Yimatutu were also recaptured one after another, and banners of the Blue Sky and White Sun were hung everywhere. Our Chahar army has formally dispatched troops to garrison the area. The righteous people Qiao Jianzhong and others have advanced towards the Xiwanzhi area of Chongli County, and there are signs that they will also capture it. Most of the civilian army and righteous people have now reached Maniba, ninety miles north of Zhangbei County, and are advancing as the opportunity arises.

In the past, the civilian army in Chahar Province was engaged in secret work, and the number and organization were not very detailed. Now, what is known is that there is a People's Anti-Japanese Army Guerrilla, with a total of four teams including Zhang Zhongying and others. Now there is also a righteous people's force that is the main force in recapturing Taomiao Village. Their team number is the People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, with Qiao Jianzhong as the commander-in-chief, divided into five routes. Cao Fatong is the commander of the first route, Zhang Jinsheng is the commander of the second route, Yang Zhensheng is the commander of the third route, Han Xixian is the commander of the fourth route, and Lou Guanjun is the commander of the fifth route. As for the strength of their subordinates, because they are scattered in various places, it is currently unknown. However, there are more than 500 people in Heihe Town, which belongs to Chicheng County. Han Xixian led the troops and originally planned to take Chongli with Qiao Jianzhong. Now, because Qiao's troops have sufficient strength to recover the city and have a surplus, they have changed their route to Duolun, aiming to cut off the puppet army's retreat and give them a great blow. Lou Guanjun, the commander of the fifth route, has been in the military for a long time and has experienced many battles, and has a great understanding and experience of warfare. Currently, there are more than 100 cadres in the team lurking in a certain place in Kangbao County, planning to take advantage of the opportunity to recover Kangbao. As for the other routes, they are also secretly working in separate directions, and the situation is becoming more and more active. The Japanese and puppet troops are strategically hit hard.

After the People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army recovered Taomiao, the whole village hung flags to celebrate, and Cao Fatong, in the name of the commander of the first route, issued a proclamation to reassure the people. The original text said, "It has been more than a year since our Chahar counties were invaded and occupied by the violent Japanese, and the people are in a deep abyss. They are only fish on the chopping board, and their ambition is still to gain an inch and push forward step by step. Recently, they have used force to disturb our Tianjin and Beiping, killing and slaughtering villagers. All kinds of vicious methods have been recognized by the world. Our Chinese nation has always advocated peace. In this situation of unbearable endurance, the people of various places have formed national salvation armies to save our nation from eternal catastrophe. Now, this commander leads hundreds of brave soldiers to drive away the bandit army stationed in the Chongli Taomiao area on the 10th of this month, and shot and killed the instructor Imaeda Uichiro, who was hated by the people, to vent their anger. Our various routes are attacking the other counties, and it will not be difficult to recover them in a short time. However, the Manchurian banknotes and copper coins issued by the puppet Manchukuo will be prohibited from general use from today. Our army is originally a people's force. Wherever we go, we treat the local elders and folks as our hometown. We will never take anything from the people. We hope that all merchants and people will open their businesses as usual and not panic. Those who are lawless and spread rumors will be severely punished without leniency. This is the announcement."

Also, a certain unit of our side has been advancing towards Shangdu from the area of Damiaozi and Tumuerte, and it is said that the Northwest Reclamation Team in Shangdu County has been recovered by us. Other units on our side are also actively preparing for battle. As for the news of the puppet army in Chahar Province, it is said that the personnel of the puppet agencies in Huade are currently extremely panicked and are preparing to move to Kangbao County, with Duolun as their rear and the hub for the connection and transportation of the Rehe and Chahar regions. At the same time, there are rumors that Prince De has left Huade and his whereabouts are unknown. Li Shou-hsin did arrive at Daqinggou (i.e. Shangyi) on the 10th of this month and planned to stay there for a long time in order to facilitate the command of the puppet army. The soldiers of the puppet Sixth Division of Bao Yin-ul-dzhi stationed in Guyuan often carry weapons and flee, and the military morale is extremely scattered. On the other hand, the people are deeply resentful because they have been trampled on by the Japanese and puppets for a long time. Now, when they hear about the recovery of Taomiao Village, they cannot help but be excited and eagerly hope that the army will come and rescue them from their predicament. In Zhangbei, Japanese troops have set up artillery positions everywhere in the Bolicai and Huanghuaping areas under the county's jurisdiction in order to defend them, and the enemy's morale has been weakened. It can be seen that the Japanese and puppet troops in Zhangbei city leave the city every night and scatter in the suburbs, and then re-enter the city after dawn. Also, more than 100 cavalrymen of the puppet Mongolian Security Team arrived north of Gaojiayingzi at 12:00 noon on the 14th.

Since the six counties of Chahar Province were forcibly carved out by the Japanese army sheltering bandits and puppets, the source of the bandits and puppets' military and political expenses is partly provided by the Japanese Kwantung Army and partly from imposing exorbitant taxes and levies on the people. Moreover, since the Battle of Honggeertu last year, the military and political center of the area, Bailingmiao (formerly known as Baihanmiao), has been successively recovered by us, giving the Japanese and puppet military, political, and economic systems a great blow. On the people's side, the heavy burden of paying taxes and serving in the military has long been exhausted, resulting in a bleak atmosphere in all industries in the market. Moreover, most of the paper money circulating in the market is the counterfeit "Manchuria" Central Bank paper money, which is equivalent to ghost money. Because merchants trade and move, the legal tender of the Central, China, Jiaotong, and Chahar Provincial Banks of our mainland has flowed into Chahar in large numbers. The general public, because of their faith in the motherland, regard the above-mentioned legal tender of our banks as treasures and are reluctant to use them easily. Now that the situation is chaotic, the general public is even more distrustful of counterfeit money, resulting in an extremely panic-stricken economic situation in various counties of Chahar. In order to maintain the economy, the Japanese and puppets have instigated the gentry of Zhangbei to come forward and jointly seek remedial measures.

### A Respectful Message to Young People and the Masses Everywhere

Yesterday a friend told me, "There are countless young people, countless masses, who want to contribute their abilities to the country, but they are suffering from having no way." This is indeed a very important question.

I thought about it carefully, and they probably want to do two things. One is to join the army and fight the enemy desperately, so that there will be one less enemy for every one they kill. The other is to offer their services to the government, hoping that my opinions will be adopted or that there will be some assistance. Of course, it is a passionate heart, but I am afraid that it is useless. Modern warfare is not a matter of risking one's life. The higher ones must have military knowledge, and the lower ones must also have formal training. If ordinary people are mixed in, it will not only be useless but also harmful. As for the political reality, we are completely ignorant. Even if you have a very high political knowledge and write a long letter, it may not be pertinent. It will only make the government people busy and talk to us, looking at our petitions and wasting useful time. This is also harmful and useless. If that's the case, where should the passion of our people be poured? Don't worry, listen to me. This war is probably a major war in the East. The enemy's Prime Minister has already declared that he is prepared for a long-term war. We should naturally prepare for a long-term response. Responding to the war does not only depend on the front line, nor does it only depend on the central government, nor does it only depend on the governments of the provinces. It still depends on the people in the hinterland. I hope that the young people and the masses everywhere will not leave their hometowns. Those who are not in their hometowns will find it difficult to make a living in commercial ports. It is better to go back as soon as possible and unite to do things that you can do in your local area.

The first is to maintain order. This is originally the responsibility of the government, but it is especially effective when local people come out to help. In this time of great disaster, there are no classes, no factions. Even if there are some opinions on weekdays, they should be crossed out with one stroke. Everyone has only one heart, which is to save the country and survive. Among them, there are several very important things: (A) Stabilize people's hearts. These days, I have heard people in the interior say that in places where enemy planes have passed, they have occasionally dropped a few bombs, and people's hearts are very panic-stricken. People living in the city are moving to the countryside one after another. In fact, the number of people who are killed or injured is very small. Fleeing may not necessarily lead to death, and not fleeing may not necessarily lead to life. Everyone should not panic. If there is no trouble in the local area, then everything can be started. (B) Eliminate bandits. This requires the power of the military police to gather them in a certain place and force them to work. (C) Intensify training. The existing citizen training should continue to be promoted. Those who are close to the war can help with rear work. Those who are far away can also prepare for the government's micro-adjustment. (D) Supervise education. The seeds of the future citizens are all in children. No matter how difficult it is, education cannot be stopped. All educated young people who cannot enter schools should take on the task of educating the younger generation. However, in this extraordinary period, I advocate that the weekly rest and summer and winter vacations should be abolished.

The second is mass production. Countless compatriots are fighting the enemy on the front line, and the national production capacity has been greatly reduced. The two words "clothing and food" are likely to become difficult. In recent years, a part of the food and cloth has relied on foreign imports. In the future, I am afraid that there will be no money to buy them. Those of us in the rear must not only provide for ourselves, but also provide for our compatriots on the front line. There is no other way but to work twice as hard, cultivate our own land, and weave our own cloth. Men who have never worked in the fields must also help with farming. The women of wealthy families should not just sit idle at home, but quickly get up and spin hemp and weave cloth. In the blink of an eye, the weather will be cold, and winter clothes for those on the front line should also be prepared as soon as possible. As for everyday items for household use, we have long been accustomed to using foreign goods. In the future, we must correct our mistakes. We should use as much of our handicrafts as possible. If they are rougher and less practical, we have to make do with them. We must also save a lot to supply the front line. Tao Kan of the Jin Dynasty usually collected a lot of bamboo heads and wood chips, which later proved to be very useful in the war. These days, the items sought by the Anti-Japanese Support Association, such as sacks, hemp ropes, bamboo and wooden carrying poles, etc., can be supplied in large quantities in the interior. In addition, there are many other things, some of which can be imitated or replaced. If we can prepare them for them, it will also be of great help to the soldiers.

Looking at it this way, there are endless things we need to do now. As long as we are willing to contribute our abilities, how can we say there is no way? All the past is like yesterday's death, and all the future is like today's birth. Brisk up your spirits and work hard. There is no need to utter empty curses at the other party, nor is there any need to run aimlessly at the crossroads.

### The Xin Yong'an Steamer Reopened to Suzhou Yesterday

Yesterday morning, one Xin Yong'an steamer was still on the Shanghai-Suzhou inland river line. It set sail from Tianhougong Bridge on the North Suzhou River, towing a tugboat and carrying about 300 passengers. There were no boats to Xishi yesterday. Because the Jinghu Railway has added passenger trains, the number of passengers on the inland river has decreased compared to the previous few days. In addition, the Shanghai-Hangzhou line has previously arranged for ships by the Huzhou Community Committee to transfer refugee compatriots back to their hometowns. Now, because most of them have been transferred, the relocation matters will be handled jointly by the Municipal Relief Association from now on.

### Liu Manqing and Others Missing

Feared to have died in the Great World tragedy

Ms. Liu Youxiang of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission is the only expert in our country who is familiar with the situation in Kangzang. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in Shanghai, Ms. Liu came to Shanghai from Beijing with Cao Ruizhi, a representative of the people of Xikang, to organize the Youth Kangzang Anti-Japanese Support Committee, staying at Room 430 of the Nanjing Hotel, and running around to contact various parties for anti-Japanese support. However, after the 14th of this month, Liu and Cao both went missing at the same time. Their relatives and friends have been searching for more than a day, but there is still no news. According to the time when Ms. Liu went missing, it coincided with the day when the Great World bombing tragedy occurred. Therefore, most of her relatives and friends deeply believe that Liu has died, but the body is still unable to be found. Currently, Ms. Liu still has many suitcases and luggage in the Nanjing Hotel. Nanjing has also tried to inquire in various directions, but there are still no results. According to Ms. Liu, she is the only outstanding researcher of the Kangzang problem in our country and can speak extremely fluent Kangzang language. She has twice represented the government to Kangzang to promote the central government's intentions and has written two books, "Kangzang Zhi Zheng" and "Border Education." It is a pity that she sacrificed her life for the national crisis this time.

### The Telephone Company Will Restore Telephone Service in the Hongkou District

The Hongkou Branch of the Shanghai Telephone Company had to temporarily close the company due to the tense war and the interruption of power supply, and all service personnel were also temporarily evacuated. Starting yesterday (26th), the original personnel of the branch office have been working as usual, planning to restore the telephone service in the area immediately. However, a severe fire occurred in the district, and the branch office was right in the middle of it. Fortunately, the fire brigade rescued it effectively, so the loss was minimal. According to the engineer of the company, the underground and aerial line projects were severely damaged, and it will take a week to repair them and restore the call.

### The Director General of the Public Works Department Sends a Letter of Thanks to Prison Staff

Since the outbreak of the war, the Public Works Department's prison has been located in the war zone, and it is extremely dangerous. The prison staff still tried their best to maintain their duties. The Director General of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession sent a letter to Major Paun, the Acting Director of the Police Department, expressing his admiration, saying, "In this autumn of tense war, all the staff of the Bureau's prison have done their best and achieved remarkable results. Please ask you to convey my admiration to the Acting Superintendent of Prison Affairs and all the staff. The Bureau deeply sympathizes with the situation of the staff and has decided to do its best to improve the current situation of the members." The following is omitted.

### Brief Report on Rear Area Work

Relief

The war in Pudong has been going on for several days. According to a refugee who escaped from the area, there are no rear area organizations at all. Furthermore, petty thieves abound, taking the opportunity to rob and plunder. The price of boats and carts is ten times higher than usual. Innocent people are not only dying from artillery fire, but also from hunger during their escape. It is deeply hoped that all sectors of Pudong will quickly find ways to organize relief efforts to reduce the suffering of their fellow villagers.

The Shanghai Municipal Relief Committee provided the following brief report on its work yesterday: ㊀ The Reception Group, after investigation, found that the administrator of the 13th Reception Center at Qingliang Temple was managing affairs poorly and ordered the center to be closed. All refugees were transferred to other reception centers. ㊁ The Repatriation Group sent 5,117 refugees by train and ship to Suzhou and Hangzhou. ㊂ The Medical Group treated 350 refugees with minor illnesses and 58 refugees with serious illnesses. ㊃ The Security Group sent personnel to work with the Repatriation Group to impound the Xin Ying Steamer for transporting refugees. ㊄ The Burial Group buried 31 corpses, bringing the total number of burials to 821. ㊅ The Secretariat sent a letter to Fuyuan Qianzhuang requesting them to take over the Hangzhou Restaurant Refugee Hospital and dispatched personnel to negotiate the details. They also sent a letter to the Director of the Bureau of Navigation, ordering that all ships be retained for repatriating refugees and not be used for commercial operations.

The Red Swastika Society's Relief Teams One and Two, led by Team Leaders Shan Hu and Shi, departed at 3:00 AM yesterday in four groups. They went to Liuying Bridge, Henan Guild Hall, Lianyi Villa, Zhenru, and other places, rescuing 12 wounded soldiers and 1 wounded civilian. They were sent to the First and Third Hospitals run by the society for treatment. It was also reported that the society sent over 150 refugees from various reception centers to the Old Garbage Bridge this morning to board two civilian boats to Wuxi, Jiangyin, and other places. Including the refugees sent yesterday, the total number of refugees transported was over 600.

The Shanghai Chinese Benevolent Children's Association recently dispatched Doctors Yu Xisheng and Song Jiaxiang, along with several nurses, to visit various refugee reception centers to assist in the work of rescuing children. If any refugee reception center wishes to conduct children's education work, they can also send a letter to the association requesting the dispatch of child education experts to assist in the operation.

The chairmen of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, in view of the hardships of their fellow villagers seeking refuge, held a meeting yesterday at the temporary office on Guangxi Road to discuss setting up a reception center. The location is at Qingliang Temple. They are currently sending personnel to negotiate with the temple. Once the negotiations are completed, the center will be opened immediately.

The Chinese Women's Mutual Aid Association held a joint meeting of all departments at the association's location on Malan Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. The resolutions were: ㊀ The First Reception Center will be temporarily merged with the Second Reception Center. ㊁ The Nursing Class will continue to be held. ㊂ Comfort wounded soldiers. ㊃ In addition to sending the shoes collected by the association to the front lines, continue to solicit and make shoes. ㊄ Regarding the service issues after the graduation of nursing students, it was resolved to request the Shanghai branch of the Women's Comfort Society to negotiate with the Red Cross Society to dispatch them for service. ㊅ The association will set up a library and reading room.

Since organizing a rescue team, the Buddhist monks in the city have been departing daily to the Bazhi Bridge and Jiangwan area to rescue wounded soldiers and civilians. The total number of wounded soldiers rescued daily is five to six hundred. Now that the center of the war has shifted to the Wusong area, the team has established contact with the military. Starting today, it will send the First and Second Sub-teams to rescue the wounded. It is reported that over 160 monks are participating in this operation.

The Jiangyin Wuxi Fellow Villagers Joint Relief Association yesterday (the 26th) had the Fu Shuichang Steamer tow 13 civilian boats, carrying the eighth batch of 2,200 refugees. Wu Jiannan and Xue Xiren led the team back to Wuxi. The association has successively repatriated nearly ten thousand people. The reception centers are located at 474 Zhejiang Road, 444 Zhejiang Road, 484 Zhejiang Road, 225 Fujian Road, and 1051 Jing'an Temple Road. They are still continuing to receive and repatriate refugees.

The Shaoxing Seven Counties Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai has been actively repatriating fellow villagers to their hometowns in recent days. Because there are very few Shanghai-Ningbo steamships and there is no fixed schedule, the issuance of ship tickets will be suspended starting today. As for the over 7,000 ship tickets that have already been issued, ticket holders can go to the Jinliyuan Wharf every day to wait for the departure of the ships. The association is currently planning other routes back to their hometowns to allow fellow villagers to return home as soon as possible.

Zhu Fengwei, Chairman of the Haiyan Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, sent over 200 refugee fellow villagers from the county a few days ago and sent another hundred or so back to their hometowns today.

Service

The Shanghai Education Sector Wartime Service Group Comfort Department has been慰問慰問 various wounded soldier hospitals for several days. Recently, they are preparing to prepare many comfort bags to distribute to the wounded soldiers. The group has also decided to select the most destitute among the refugees and distribute approximately 500 pieces of old clothes that have been collected in recent days. As for the students who have been affected by the disaster, those who have no home to return to and are in very difficult circumstances will be appropriately accommodated.

The Chinese National Road Construction Association has made some changes to its work in this Shanghai anti-Japanese war compared to peacetime: ㊀ The highway relief service vehicle departs to participate in the Anti-Enemy Support Association to provide relief to damaged or endangered vehicles. ㊁ All staff of the Lichang Automobile Repair Factory, which it sponsors, are always ready to repair ambulance vehicles. ㊂ All staff of the association manage a refugee reception center run by the Joint Disaster Relief Association, which houses over 1,800 people. Therefore, the association's work is exceptionally busy.

The Workers' Wartime Service Group organized by the Shanghai Industrial Sector National Salvation Association, in addition to the first batch departing to the front lines to participate in work and the second batch going to a certain place to undergo training, the third batch of approximately one hundred people will gather at a certain place this morning at 9:00 AM to be divided into teams and depart to participate in the service.
