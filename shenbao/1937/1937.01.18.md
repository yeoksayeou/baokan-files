### Japan to Send Special Economic Mission to China

Seeking to Adjust Sino-Japanese Relations from an Economic Perspective, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Begun to Consider This Issue

[Tokyo] Recently, the Japanese people's discussions on Sino-Japanese relations have increasingly focused on economic issues. This trend is quite noteworthy. In particular, leaders in the business community are earnestly hoping that the Japanese government will do its utmost to realize the Sino-Japanese economic cooperation plan. The speech given by Yūki Toyotarō, chairman of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry, at the New Year's banquet on the fifteenth of this month was extremely clear and had the greatest impact. It is reported that the Japan-China Business Association, the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and other private economic organizations have recently begun to consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the concrete work related to the above-mentioned issues. The first issue proposed for discussion seems to be the suggestion of sending a special economic mission to China. This move has two important meanings: ① A return visit to the Republic of China's industrial inspection mission to Japan in 1935; ② To frankly exchange views with all sectors of Chinese society from the standpoint of non-governmental economic organizations regarding the prospects of economic cooperation, so as to promote the adjustment of relations between the two countries. Kodama Kenji, chairman of the Japan-China Business Association, is the most promising candidate for the position of head of the mission, and its members will be famous figures from the Japanese financial and business communities. Yūki Toyotarō told the press about this matter yesterday, saying that Japan's policy towards China has now reached a critical turning point, so the approach of relying solely on Kasumigaseki diplomacy should be liquidated and replaced with economic diplomacy. Furthermore, in the future, the selection of ambassadors to China should be made from people in the economic and financial sectors who have rich experience and broad vision. The leaders of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have now begun to consider this issue. I believe that unless efforts are made from an economic perspective to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, it will be difficult to succeed in the end. (Seventeenth day Central News Agency dispatch)

### The Working Efficiency of the British

— Translated by H. Casson Burke

America is a progressive country, Britain is a traditional country: this has become a common belief for the past fifty years. America is probably considered the most modern, while Britain is considered old-fashioned, lagging behind the times. If a young businessman wants to learn new theories and methods of business, he will most likely go to New York rather than London.

This belief is not entirely reliable. If someone just wants to know what is new, then he should of course go to New York; however, if he wants to know what is sound and profitable! In other words, if he wants to learn not experimentation but success, then he should go to London to study those large companies with five generations of history.

I have lived in Canada for twenty-four years, in the United States for twenty-one years, and in Britain for twenty years, and have handled nearly five hundred businesses in these three regions. I can compare the business methods and business theories of the three regions.

It is absolutely certain that before the Great War, Britain was slowly losing its position as the world's most advanced industrial nation. During the Great War and the six years that followed, under the manipulation of bureaucrats and politicians, British business entered a state of stagnation.

By 1920, the revival of private enterprise had begun. The manipulation of bureaucratic politics gradually loosened. The following twelve years were a period of slow and unstable recovery. Only in the early 1933 did a sound upward movement begin, and this movement has continued ever since. At present, there is no doubt that Britain's business situation is better than that of any other country.

In 1933, Britain established more new factories than any other country. In that year, 95 old factories were expanded, and 463 new factories were opened. In the whole world, there is only one car manufacturer with a profit of 100%. This is the British Austin Company. Since 1926, the production and export volume of the Austin Company have increased fivefold, and wages have increased 1.45 times. The company has reduced the price of its cars by 65%, and the annual dividends paid are the highest of all factories in Britain. It receives no help from the government, nor does it have any special monopoly or priority. It is a remarkable example of "British efficiency."

Britain has seized the hegemony of the clock manufacturing industry from Germany. A clock factory in London, founded in 1931, currently produces 500,000 pieces annually, most of which are electric clocks. Also, in toy manufacturing, Britain is on par with Germany. In Nuremberg, the center of the German toy industry, a large number of British toys translated by H. Casson Burke are sold.

In the past three years, Britain's housing construction industry can be called unparalleled in the world. Since the Great War, 2.25 million new houses have been built. Currently, an average of 100 new houses are built every day! Only 15% of these are built with taxpayer money, and the rest are private enterprises. More than half of the British people live in their own houses.

Since 1929, only one British department store has gone bankrupt, and the rest have been making money every year. No railway is losing money. No large hotel is on the verge of bankruptcy. No bank has gone bankrupt.

I believe that there is one fact that Canadians and Americans cannot believe, and that is: the fastest-growing towns in the world are currently in Britain. For example, in 1929, Wembley had a population of 20,000, which has now increased to 60,000. In 1928, Hayes had a population of 11,000, which has now increased to 35,000. There are at least twenty towns with such rapid population growth. The prosperity of these towns is not due to advertising, but to the creation of new businesses.

British efficiency can be seen in the places where these new businesses are developing. In industry, government funding is very little. Except for domestic trade protection policies, it can be said that the government provides no help at all. The prosperity created in Britain is not derived from debt. The British are unwilling to buy temporary prosperity and pass the bills on to future generations. They develop business by making profits, without artificial value inflation.

Just as with business, British merchants and financiers have unparalleled efficiency. This efficiency is not based on statistics, standardized measurements, and organization charts. Nor is it completely scientific, mechanical, or logical. This efficiency is not obvious, so it does not attract much attention.

The British have less originality than the Americans. They are skeptical of plans and new proposals. Many British inventions are neglected in their own country but developed in the United States. In terms of originality, the United States is indeed superior to other countries; but originality is just one of the skills needed in a business organization.

In the British view, Americans are using the method of growing flowers in a greenhouse in business. They demand five years of expertise to be realized in one year. They use all kinds of possible stimulants. They invent "high-pressure" salesmanship, mass production, overvaluation, artificial prosperity, and securities manipulation. What they show others is "what can be done," not "what can be done safely." This is the British opinion.

Americans are optimists and pessimists. In good times, he is an optimist; in bad times, he is a pessimist. The British are neither optimists nor pessimists. He seems to be indifferent to the ups and downs of the market. He knows that prosperity and recession are only temporary. He never believes that he is following the world; he never believes that he has lost everything. No matter what happens, he just keeps going.

The central principle of British efficiency, I must say, is common sense. The British are a mature nation. Even if they reform, they reform very carefully. Most of their experiments are considered temporary. The British do not like completely new things. Unless a new plan is considered reasonable by the general public, the British will never adopt it.

The second principle is tolerance. Since the Great War, the elimination of class differences and prejudices has been very significant. Half of the members of the House of Lords were born into poverty. In such a country, class revolutions are not easy to happen.

Britain is a country of compromise. "This is my last word, take it or leave it," the British know that saying such things is childish. He is a person who "can give and take," not haggling over the last penny. As a result, there are fewer conflicts and stalemates than in other countries. Reducing conflict is a very effective way to reduce prices.

The creed in the British business world is "improvement"! Slow and steady improvement. The British are more eager to "grab what they have" than to "realize hope." British merchants rarely use charts. He does not see his business as a wave line. This is partly because he has no illusions, but partly because he has mastered all the details and personnel of his organization. He often thinks from a human point of view. When he formulates a plan, he must make the plan suitable for his clerks, his customers, and tradition. If he can tolerate it, he will never break the rules. According to the technology of efficiency, this is an expedient policy, but in Britain it seems to be clever and practical. For more than a hundred years, this has become the most successful of all business policies.

British merchants can find ways to prevent bankruptcy themselves. No company that produces famous products is allowed to go bankrupt. When such a company has exhausted its assets and can no longer borrow money, the creditor bank will entrust a successful peer to operate it. Under the management of new talent, the company's life can be saved.

Generally speaking, the British view business organizations as a whole. They believe in "team game." Therefore, many problems that other countries are still difficult to deal with have been solved in Britain. This old and large country has a unique efficiency type. In terms of profitable and safe business operations, Britain is currently at the forefront of the world. (Maclean's Magazine)

### The Issue of Reforming Administrative Agencies

— Xing

The streamlining of administrative agencies is a universal demand in all countries. In Japan, the administrative reform plan proposed by Army Minister Terauchi has become the core issue of the Tokyo political storm. Recently, the United States has also proposed an administrative reform plan. Although the motive for the US administrative reform plan is not entirely the same as that of Japan. Japan's motive comes from the military, and its intention is to make the government conform to the needs of wartime. The motive of the United States comes from the President, and its intention is to reduce administrative waste and unify the power of command. However, the content of the two reform plans is similar in many places. And these common propositions are quite worthy of emulation by our government.

The most important of the reform proposals is, of course, the consolidation of administrative agencies. Although the United States now has only ten departments, independent committees and administrative bureaus have sprung up like mushrooms since Roosevelt took office. Every new law passed establishes a new administrative agency, wasting national funds to a great extent. Under the original ten departments, the various divisions and bureaus are also disorganized. For example, health administration is located in the Ministry of Finance, and engineering and water conservancy belong to the Ministry of Military Affairs. Therefore, the new reform plan advocates dividing the more than 100 agencies now under the government's jurisdiction, such as various committees and bureaus, among the various departments of the cabinet. The reform plan in Japan also advocates the consolidation of redundant agencies, such as the merger of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, the merger of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the merger of the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications. Administrative agencies of the same nature should be under the jurisdiction of one department. This is the principle of administrative organization. Due to historical habits and personal relationships, governments of various countries often set up many agencies and waste the national treasury. This phenomenon is even more serious in China today. We should refer to the new plans of Japan and the United States and formulate a plan for the consolidation of administrative agencies.

Secondly, is the attention to social and economic issues. Most of the administrative work of modern governments is related to the economic life of the people, and the inherited administrative agencies are not enough to meet the current economic requirements. Therefore, the administrative reform plan in the United States advocates adding a Department of Social Welfare and a Department of Construction. In the past four years, the new administrative agencies established by the US government, such as the Public Works Administration, the Farmers Home Administration, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, were entirely established to relieve unemployment, assist the poor, and solve the economic panic. The cost is several times that of the original departments. The Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Construction are to include these newly established agencies. The trend of politics in various countries is for the government to dominate the economic life of the people. In the Soviet Union, in Germany and Italy, the government's activities in the economic field far exceed activities of a purely political nature. Therefore, the addition of economic administrative agencies is very necessary. The reform plan in Japan also has a proposal to integrate the Resources Agency and the Research Bureau to create an agency to control important national policies. The Chinese government has established a National Economic Council, the motive is also the same. However, the organization is special and should be changed to a special department to bring the administrative agency into line with the norm.

As for the establishment of intelligence agencies, the general application of the examination system, the centralization and elevation of the President's administrative power, the elevation of the status and expansion of the powers of the Budget Office, the establishment of special agencies to study the promotion of administrative efficiency, and the establishment of special personnel to connect the administrative and legislative parts to make them harmonious and coordinated, the appointment and promotion of civil servants are all based on merit to eliminate the malpractice of appointing private individuals. All of these are things that governments of various countries should emulate and are the basic conditions for promoting administrative efficiency. Our country's administrative authorities have recently paid quite a lot of attention to the issue of efficiency. It is hoped that the authorities can find out the key points that we should reform from the new reform plans of neighboring countries.

### Report that Göring and Italy Have Agreed on Three Points

The Two Countries Unite to Promote Anti-Communism, Close Cooperation in Air Force Technology, Göring to Visit Warsaw Next Month

[Paris] Madame Tabouis, the diplomatic correspondent of the Esprit newspaper, recently commented on the talks currently being conducted by German Aviation Minister Göring and Mussolini, believing that Italy is likely to unite with Germany in order to assist Japan and make Japan's anti-communist movement more effective. As for European issues, Madame Tabouis believes that Göring and Mussolini have reached a decision on the following three points: ㊀ Regarding the Spanish Civil War, contact will be made with Britain to form an agreement between Britain, Germany, and Italy, with the ultimate goal of establishing a "moderate and liberal government" in Spain. Although this government should be controlled by the Nationalist leader General Franco, it will "not be solely controlled by General Franco." As for Britain's new proposal regarding the prohibition of volunteers enlisting in Spain, the Italian and German governments do not intend to submit a reply at this time, but will propose the formation of an international police force to maintain law and order in Spain, as was done during the plebiscite in the Saar region in January 1935. At the same time, the Italian and German troops "who have already been sent to Spain" will "not be recalled." ㊁ Regarding the mutual cooperation between the Italian and German air forces in technology and military strategy, the two sides have reached a complete compromise. This cooperation has been implemented in Spain for a long time, and will be extended to other places in the future. ㊂ Regarding the cooperative relationship between the intelligence agencies of Italy and Germany, it will become closer in the future. (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 17th)

[Rome] German Aviation Minister General Göring continued to stroll the streets this afternoon, buying various items, and lingered in the Cuban shops for a long time. In the evening, Mr. and Mrs. Göring were invited by the Foreign Minister of Italy, Mr. and Mrs. Ciano, to listen to music at the German State Opera. After the play, Ciano invited Mr. and Mrs. Göring to supper at a large hotel. Göring is scheduled to meet King Victor Emmanuel III near Ostia Harbor at 8 AM tomorrow for hunting, and will return here in the afternoon to meet with German expatriates. (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 16th)

Warsaw: German Aviation Minister General Göring is currently conducting talks with Italian authorities in Rome. It is learned that General Göring will come to Poland in the second half of February for a purely private trip, but he may still meet with Polish authorities. At that time, Göring will go hunting in Białowieża Forest, and his wife will also accompany him. It is reported that since Germany and Poland established a non-aggression treaty in January 1934, General Göring has come to Poland for travel three times before and after, and this will be the fourth time.

### French Ambassador to Germany Returns to His Post in Berlin

Germany Eager to Seek Economic Approachment with Britain and France

[Paris] The French Ambassador to Germany, François-Poncet, recently returned to his country to report on his work and has returned to his post after completing his work. He hosted a banquet for the German Foreign Minister Neurath at his post in Berlin yesterday. The Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Mushanokoji, was also present. After the banquet, François-Poncet and Neurath held talks. Regarding this matter, Madame Tabouis, the diplomatic correspondent of the Esprit newspaper, recently stated that German officials and economic figures attach great importance to the situation of the talks between Neurath and François-Poncet. "German figures are now eagerly seeking economic rapproachment with Britain and France." Therefore, Germany may propose to France that it is willing to conclude a military assistance pact as an exchange condition for the establishment of economic consultations.

### German and Italian Tactics to Alienate France and Russia

Preparing to Conclude a Treaty with Britain and France, Excluding the Soviet Union from Europe

[Rome] According to a reliable diplomatic source today, Italy and Germany are prepared to compromise with European democracies, no longer insisting on establishing a fascist government in Spain, but still opposing a communist government. If Britain and France can revise the Four-Power Pact to prevent the Soviet Union from participating in European affairs in the future, then discussions are possible. It is said that Mussolini found it difficult to get General Göring to agree to this point, and only by declaring that Italy does not want to join Germany in turning the Spanish Civil War into a European war did he obtain Göring's consent. However, before any diplomatic results are achieved, Italy and Germany will continue to assist the Nationalist forces. (16th National Telegram)

[Rome] British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Eric Drummond, is scheduled to return to London next Tuesday and paid a visit to Foreign Minister Count Ciano the other day for discussions. As a result, political figures have made various speculations. However, according to well-informed sources, when Drummond met with Ciano the other day, they only discussed Italy's response to Britain's new proposal regarding volunteers going to Spain. However, one thing is certain, that is, Prime Minister Mussolini now holds the view of concluding a treaty between Britain, France, Germany and Italy in the near future. It is also unknown whether German Aviation Minister Göring discussed this treaty with Mussolini recently. It is estimated that Germany and Italy have now decided to take joint action on the Spanish issue, but at the same time they must coordinate with Britain. If so, then the stubborn attitude of Italy and Germany towards the Spanish event will inevitably be affected by Britain's moderate spirit and change somewhat. But on the other hand, if the joint action of Britain, Italy, and Germany becomes a reality, then France will be isolated and will have to abandon its friendly attitude towards the Soviet Union. Observing the recent Italian newspapers' vigorous attacks on France, while the wording towards Britain is relatively gentle, it can be seen that Italy's intention is to form a united front between Britain, Germany, and Italy, so as to force France to break away from the Soviet Union, which is very clear. (17th Havas Telegram)

[Paris] News has recently come from Germany and Italy that Britain, France, Germany, and Italy may form a treaty. The French newspapers have recently commented on this, believing that the intention is to test the atmosphere. If France signs this treaty, then the connection between France and the Little Entente countries will automatically break down. Nothing could be more foolish. (17th Havas Telegram)

[Berlin] The Völkischer Beobachter recently published an interview with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini by its Rome correspondent, entitled "The Relationship Between Italy and Germany is the Foundation for Building a New Europe." The content of the conversation roughly stated that after the establishment of the British-Italian Mediterranean Agreement, the axis formed by Italy and Germany was not only not weakened, but became even stronger. As for the so-called "theory of organizing the United States of Europe, although I do not deeply believe in it, we know that Bolshevism is the only crisis threatening our culture and life, so we cannot help but feel that European countries need to unite to deal with this crisis. However, the democratic countries have unknowingly become the source of sin, and the germs of Bolshevism are also parasitic in them. These countries have now formed a system and formed a group, which is obviously different from the group of Germany and Italy." (17th Havas Telegram)

### Franco-Soviet Pact

Italy and Germany See it as a Thorn in Their Side

[Rome] The Tribuna recently published an editorial on the front page, stating, "Britain now wants Italy to act as a mediator so that Britain and Germany can reconcile. However, the British side still seems to have many doubts about the attitude currently adopted by Germany. If the mediation of Italy can dispel the suspicions between the two sides, then people all over the world will be grateful to the Italian government. According to the reason why the British-Italian Gentleman's Agreement could not be extended to allow other countries to participate, the main obstacles were the mutual agreements between France and Russia, and the disputes between France and Germany. After the establishment of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, the Third International was able to gain a foothold in Central Europe, which Italy and Germany cannot tolerate. As for the interference of the Soviet Union, the discord between Germany and France is actually caused by the provocation and incitement of Moscow. Therefore, if we want to solve various issues related to European order and peace, we must first solve the problem of Bolshevism before we can." (17th Havas)

[Berlin] The external organ newspaper "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" recently published an article by diplomatic reporter Miguel Le, roughly stating, "We will never take a step back in our political independence for the sake of gaining practical benefits in economy and finance. This is what foreign countries should know. Some foreign countries may think that the German government is now prepared to bow down to Britain and France and admit its mistakes, which is not worth laughing at. Moreover, Germany has already made contributions to the restriction of armaments, but all countries in the world do not agree, which is extremely infuriating. It is also said that the combined military power of France and its allies is extremely large, and its quantity is definitely not comparable to the German army. Therefore, if we want to seek a practical solution to the relationship between Germany and France, we should try our best to make the alliance treaty signed by France with other countries useless, or eliminate the parts of the alliance treaty that are enough to endanger peace." (17th Havas)

German State of Lippe-Detmold, January 1933. When Germany held the presidential election in the House of Representatives in January 1933, the Nazi Party won an unprecedented victory in the Lippe-Detmold constituency. On January 30 of the same month, the Nazi Party rose to power. Today is the fourth anniversary of the Nazi Party's election victory in the area. Rosenburg, the director of the Nazi Party's foreign affairs team, delivered a speech, roughly stating, "Foreign politicians, on the one hand, oppose dividing Europe into two opposing blocs, and on the other hand, they call on the major democratic countries of the West to unite. How illogical is this. The major democratic countries such as France have now signed a political and military alliance treaty with the Soviet Union to form a political and military group, but they are still calling for unity, which will inevitably give people a bad impression." Subsequently, Interior Minister Frick delivered a speech, saying, "Leader Hitler saved Germany from being infected by the Bolshevik plague, but foreign countries continue to slander and frame Germany. However, Germany will never lose its cool head because of this. Germany is determined to seek peace and will prove its determination to defend peace with an honest attitude." Continuing to discuss the economic situation, he said, "If the world economy stagnates and does not advance, then the fault is definitely not in Germany. We do not approve of the policy of absolute self-sufficiency, but the German people must survive. If other countries cannot give us the resources necessary for survival, then we will have to rely on our inventive spirit and national resources to create the resources necessary for survival. In short, we cannot hope for wealth to fall from the sky, so we must obtain it through our own efforts. Since Germany is one of the major powers, it should not be excluded from the distribution of wealth in the world for a long time." (16th Havas Telegram)

### French Press Commentary

Italian and German Attempts Will Surely Fail

[Paris] Germany and Italy are now exaggerating the harm of Bolshevism to the world, wanting to use it to win over Britain and sign a gentleman's agreement with these countries on the Spanish issue. French newspapers have commented on this attempt, believing that it will surely fail, and also believe that it is difficult to say whether France can reach a satisfactory understanding with Germany on economic matters. Le Petit Parisien reported, "Germany and Italy are about to submit a response to Britain's recent new proposal (that is, the proposal to prohibit volunteers from joining Spain). At this moment, the French House of Representatives has passed the bill to prohibit volunteers from joining the war. Therefore, Germany and Italy cannot attack France in their reply and must change their wording to accuse the Soviet Union. However, according to reliable news, the Soviet Union has now decided to follow in the footsteps of Britain and France and implement a policy of non-interference. The efforts of Germany and Italy will be in vain, and they will soon be exhausted." L'Echo de Paris published an article by the famous reporter Pertinax, roughly saying, "Britain and France now understand that negotiating a four-power pact with Germany is tantamount to paving the way for Pan-Germanism and Central European policy (that is, the policy pursued by German Emperor Wilhelm II before World War I) and helping it succeed. They will not drink poison to quench their thirst to avoid the danger of Germany and Italy intervening in the Mediterranean." L'Ordre published an article by the famous reporter Madame Tabouis, saying that Britain will never sign an agreement with Germany and Italy. The Communist Party's "L'Humanité" believes that the results of German Aviation Minister Göring's visit to Italy will definitely have a negative impact on the future of the non-interference policy in the Spanish civil war. "But even if the non-interference policy never has any hope of being implemented, the power of peace-loving countries is great and can still be used by coercive means to maintain peace." Le Journal reported that there was much speculation about the trip to Paris by German Economics Minister Dr. Schacht. "Anyone who launches this proposal and wants to discuss economic cooperation issues with the German authorities before they have grasped the reality of the situation politically is too hasty." Le Petit Journal reported that the international situation is now on the verge of danger. It is imperative to understand whether the democratic countries are prepared to rescue it. It is known that German factories are now processing and manufacturing tools to control the world (referring to armaments). "Do we want to use economic cooperation to subsidize these factories under the pretext of guaranteeing peace?" Le Temps reported that "the current problem is not just one aspect, and France cannot solve it alone." (17th Havas Telegram)

### Japan Uses the Eucharistic Congress

Plans to Conduct Political Activities

[Paris] The World Catholic Congress is scheduled to be held in Manila on the 3rd of next month. L'Ordre's diplomatic reporter Madame Tabouis recently published an article, roughly saying, "According to well-informed sources, the Japanese representatives will propose to the Congress to establish a special committee composed of local Catholics to study the question of whether countries in the Far East can take joint action to resist communism." The reporter also said, "Japan's activities towards the Vatican to seek the Holy See's official assistance in its anti-communist work are not a matter of a day or two. This has also been frequently publicized in Italy and Germany. The Italian government has also strongly urged the Holy See to entrust Japan with the cultural mission of resisting communism and the Soviet Union in the Far East." (17th Havas Telegram)

### Japanese Newspapers Report that the Soviet Union Lent Money to Outer Mongolia

Shanghai Translation by the Outer Theory Agency. The Mainichi Shimbun says that according to a certain source, Moscow is greatly strengthening its preparations for the war crisis in the Far East. In connection with this, the Soviet government has lent 11 million rubles to Outer Mongolia. The above loan is for transportation construction during the war between the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia.

### German Training Ship Arrives in Yokohama

Coming to Shanghai and then to Beijing at the End of the Month

[Yokohama] The German training cruiser "Emden" (5,400 tons) arrived outside Yokohama Port this morning from North Borneo. The Nazi naval flag was hung high on its masts. German expatriates in Japan hired small boats to welcome it. It is reported that the ship is scheduled to depart from Yokohama on the morning of the 24th and stop briefly in Kobe, and is also planning to arrive in Nanjing on the morning of the 28th to pay its respects to the National Government, and then return to Shanghai. It is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for a week. (17th Domei Telegram)

### Japanese Government's Policy Towards Parliament

Decides to Take a Strong Stance

[Tokyo] The government's and political parties' policies towards Parliament are becoming increasingly urgent as the meeting approaches. Political parties are still taking a self-restrained attitude towards diplomatic issues, but they will vent their anger on the budget proposal, especially thoroughly attacking the tax increase bill, the electricity bill, and the extension of compulsory education bill, and want to make the deliberation of the electricity bill and the extension of compulsory education bill unfinished and without results. The government also wants to implement its reform policies recently, such as the reform measures after the February 26 Incident, to a minimum. Therefore, if the political parties do not approve of the government's policy, the government will not hesitate to dissolve the parliament and fully express its strong stance. Therefore, it is expected that the current parliament will have a fairly complicated political situation due to the reform policies proposed by the government. (17th Domei Telegram)

### British Naval, Land and Air Forces to Hold Major Exercises in Singapore Next Month

Testing the Defense Capabilities of the Naval Base, the China Fleet Will Also Participate

[London] The British naval, land and air forces will hold important major exercises together in Singapore in mid-February. Naval and army experts are now eagerly awaiting the results of this move. Although the Singapore naval base still needs to spend 2 million pounds on mechanical equipment, it is widely believed that the current condition of the naval base can withstand very severe tests to see if it is complete and solid. All British naval ships stationed in China that can be transferred will participate in the exercise. It is estimated that the "Dorsetshire" will also be among them. The ship will return home when the exercise is over. The "Norfolk", which has been remodeled and has recently left the dock after a complete remodeling in Chatham, is scheduled to sail to China on February 9 to replace the "Dorsetshire". The air force participating in the exercise includes two squadrons of torpedo bombers and two squadrons of airships, all of which are stationed in Singapore. In addition, there are two squadrons of aircraft carried by the aircraft carrier "Hermes", one squadron of catapult aircraft belonging to the third ship of the "Dorsetshire", and squadrons of aircraft from India and Iraq, the number of which is currently kept secret. The expansion of the Singapore air force base is estimated to cost 1.604 million pounds, of which only 47,000 pounds has been used so far, but its capacity should be sufficient for the major exercise. The garrison in Singapore has four heavy artillery squadrons, two anti-aircraft artillery squadrons, three fortress engineer squadrons, two infantry battalions, the First and Second Bengal Regiments and one Malay Regiment will also participate.

### The Process of the "Aragon" Being Detained by a German Ship

Malaga The merchant ship "Aragon" belonging to the Basque Autonomous Region government was recently detained by a German cruiser, and the ship and its cargo were confiscated. It was not until now that the crew was released. A certain captain has arrived here and gave a speech, saying, "The 'Aragon' was detained one mile offshore on the Basque Autonomous Region sea. At that time, it was forced by a German warship to sail into the port of Villa Real belonging to the Nationalist forces, and then ordered to sail to the port of Cadiz, and the crew was imprisoned on the ship and not allowed to disembark for 13 days. The cargo on board, such as flour, groceries, various manufactured products, and 250 tons of lead ore, were all unloaded at the port of Cadiz and transferred to the cargo ship "Blancagar", which was flying the German flag. The crew was only released a few days ago. Six of them were unwilling to return to the area under the jurisdiction of the Republican government and have transferred to the international neutral port of Tangier." (16th Havas Telegram)

### Germany Blocks the Kiel Canal

Foreign Warships Are Prohibited from Free Passage The French Political World Does Not Mind

[Paris] Yesterday, the German Navy Department announced that the Kiel Canal would no longer allow foreign warships to pass freely. The political world here does not mind this very much, because after Germany abolished the aviation clauses in the Treaty of Versailles last November, this kind of action has been regarded as inevitable. From then on, if the warships and military ships of the great powers want to pass through the canal, they must first obtain the permission of the German authorities through diplomatic channels before they can pass.

I deeply hope that among all nations, especially the French and German nations, we can use this to communicate emotions and pass it on forever." (16th Havas Telegram)

### All-Russian Soviet Congress Discusses Kalinin's Report

New Constitution Strengthens National Power - Fascist Conspiracy Bound to Fail

[Moscow] At the 17th Extraordinary All-Russian Congress, Kalinin presented a report on the draft constitution of the Russian Republic, stating:

"The social and economic changes in our country have enabled us to establish a new form of government on an exceptionally democratic foundation. Under the leadership of Stalin, we have industrialized our country, transformed agriculture according to socialist principles, liquidated capitalism in industry, agriculture, and trade, eliminated the system of exploitation of man by man, and established socialism as the unshakable foundation of the Soviet Union's economic and political life." Kalinin then elaborated on the draft constitution, especially emphasizing one of the basic obligations of citizens, namely, defending the motherland. He demanded that citizens have tenfold vigilance, not only on the borders but also within the country, to eliminate any attempts by enemies to harm the Soviet Union's defense capabilities. "Our enemies, because they have been suppressed, no longer dare to appear openly before the people. But this must not cause us to disregard the issue of vigilance. On the contrary, this struggle has become even more acute and has taken on an international form, not only politically but also organizationally. The Spanish Civil War is a clear example of this," he said.

Yesterday, during the congress's discussion of Kalinin's report, thirteen representatives expressed their opinions.

Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Sulimov, delivered a lengthy speech, detailing the great achievements of Soviet Russia in the economic, cultural, and political spheres. He elaborated on the various articles of the new draft constitution, the changes in the work of local administrative organs, and the improvements that should be made to the work of Soviet organs after the promulgation of the new constitution. Sulimov said, "The main characteristic of our Soviet Federation is the voluntary union of the various republics within the Soviet Union and the right to freely secede from the union. Since its establishment, the Soviet Union has become a truly solid fortress of socialism. All its republics have grown in economic, cultural, and political terms. Soviet Russia, as a member of the Soviet Union, has grown in the same way as the other republics. In a very short period, the country has achieved great success both internally and externally."

Sulimov then pointed out that the current international situation is characterized by the increasing aggressiveness of fascist countries and their conspiracy to attack the Soviet Union. He said, "With the tolerance of the so-called democratic countries, the German and Italian fascists are openly and maliciously strangling the Spanish people and placing their fascist puppet, General Franco, on their heads. Fascism is openly instigating war. Under this extreme danger, the various Soviet republics must unite even more closely within the unified Soviet state. They must raise even higher the banner of struggle for peace and unite all progressive people to resist the fascist bandits. The borders of Soviet Russia are very vast, but the enemies should know that our country can inflict a crushing blow on all imperialist countries, no matter where they are (applause). Because they dare not contend with our great Soviet power alone, they are preparing to attack us in alliance. Our country will never be caught unprepared by the enemy. Those who provoke military adventures will be the first to lose their heads!" (Applause) (TASS, 17th)

[Moscow] Today, all newspapers published commentaries on the Extraordinary All-Russian Soviet Congress, which opened on the 15th, and Kalinin's report on the draft constitution of Soviet Russia.

Pravda said, "The victory we have achieved fills all the Soviet people with a glorious feeling. This victory is precious to all the people, and especially to the heroic Russians, because the Russians are in the leading position in the struggle against tyranny, pointing the way to freedom and well-being for all other people. The great proletariat has multiplied the strength of the Russian nation and all the nations within the Soviet Union many times over.

"Let the enemies of the Soviet Union remember well that if anyone invades Soviet territory, violates its revolutionary victories, and its freedom, the entire great Russian nation will rise up as one. The entire Russian people, free, happy, culturally and militarily well-armed, will set out to resist the enemy together with all the Soviet nations and achieve victory as a result. Soviet Russia is the most advanced of all the equal republics of the Soviet Union. Its industrial production accounts for 70% of the entire Soviet Union, and its 90% collectivized agricultural harvest has been increasing steadily. Its territory stretches from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean. Its population totals 105 million. Soviet Russia uses all its strength to promote the surging growth of its fraternal republics. The draft constitution of Soviet Russia is based on the same great principles as the Soviet constitution. The astonishing provisions of the draft have deeply moved all those at the congress. The great rights of Soviet citizens were reaffirmed at this congress, confirming Stalinism's concern for the people's happiness and the motherland's welfare. The obligations of Soviet citizens were reaffirmed at this congress, further confirming the power of the Soviet government and the nation. The friendly union of the Russian Republic and the other nations of the Soviet Union has become an irresistible force!" (TASS, 17th)

### Camouflaged Organization of Austrian Patriotic Defense Corps

In the city of Linz, the Internal Defense Corps and its affiliated Patriotic Defense Corps were previously dissolved by government order due to internal divisions between two factions. One faction was led by Major Fei, the head of the Vienna Patriotic Defense Corps, and the other by Prince Starhemberg, the leader of the Internal Defense Corps. The two factions were in constant conflict. Several months later, a camouflaged organization of the Patriotic Defense Corps has been established in Linz, called the "Internal Defense Corps Mutual Aid Association." This association was jointly initiated by the Governor of Upper Austria, Leninger, the head of the Linz Criminal Investigation Department, Reiweder, and several former leaders of the Patriotic Defense Corps. There are plans to promote it nationwide and establish mutual aid associations of the same nature in various provinces. According to the initiators of the association, they originally belonged to the faction within the Internal Defense Corps that was close to the National Socialist Party. That faction has always prohibited Jews from joining the old Internal Defense Corps. The faction opposing them, led by Major Fei, is also in the process of establishing a camouflaged Patriotic Defense Corps organization. (Havas, 17th)

### British Businessman to Conduct Business Negotiations in the U.S.

Reciprocal Principles Will Lead to the Conclusion of a Trade Agreement Between the Two Countries - World Economic Stability Will Not Be Difficult to Achieve

[New York] British Trade Minister Runciman will soon travel to the United States and meet with President Roosevelt. According to American officials, this meeting is purely of a ceremonial nature. Both British and American authorities have stated that Runciman's trip does not carry any special mission. However, business figures believe that Runciman's purpose here is to negotiate a trade agreement between Britain and the United States, as informal business negotiations between the two countries have been underway for some time. After Runciman arrives in the United States, he will undoubtedly gather all the necessary materials as the basis for concluding a trade agreement. Some commercial experts in the United States believe that once a trade agreement between Britain and the United States is concluded, Secretary of State Hull's reciprocal policy can be said to have reached its highest point. The legal and commercial relations between the United States have already established a trade agreement based on the principle of reciprocity. In addition, a monetary agreement has been signed between Britain, France, and the United States. Now, if Britain and the United States also sign a trade agreement, it will greatly benefit the reduction of international tariff barriers and the abolition of various restrictions on international trade. By taking this a step further, world economic stability will not be difficult to achieve. Semi-official sources also claim that Runciman will discuss war debts and international monetary stability with American authorities. However, most people believe that Runciman's actions cannot bind the British government. He is only trying to probe American views for future negotiations. (Havas, 16th)

[Washington] International monetary stability seems to be a major goal of President Roosevelt's second term. Today, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau held a secret meeting with the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, requesting an extension of the president's power to reduce the value of currency and use the equalization fund. After the meeting, it was rumored that the Secretary of the Treasury was very optimistic about the attitudes of various countries. One committee member even said that if the business community heard the Secretary of the Treasury's report, they would not fear another rise or fall in the dollar. The meaning is that the Secretary of the Treasury has reiterated that the government intends to maintain the current price of the dollar and will not change it again until international monetary stability is achieved. If other countries devalue their currencies and endanger the dollar, the government still has one-tenth of the value that has been approved by Congress to reduce, which is enough to cope. However, other countries are unlikely to take this action. As for the use of the equalization fund, outsiders are still confused. According to the information obtained after today's meeting, the following three points are known: ㊀ The government has made a profit of $6.1 million. ㊁ Only $2 million has been used from the fund. ㊂ The cost of using the fund last year totaled $226,000. (National Telegram, 16th)

[Washington] Senator Glass today reported to the Senate on the results of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee's review of the extension of the president's power to use the equalization fund and reduce the value of currency. It is said that the Treasury Department stated to the committee that the equalization fund is essential if the monetary agreement between Britain, France, and the United States is to continue.

### U.S. and Nicaragua to Dig Canal

Running Parallel to the Panama Canal - U.S. Congressmen Plan to Introduce Bill

[Washington] Democratic Senator Walsh of Massachusetts and Representative Vincent of Georgia recently announced that they are about to introduce bills in the Senate and House of Representatives, respectively, requesting that a canal be dug in Nicaragua, Central America, to run parallel to the Panama Canal, so as to connect the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Walsh also said that the canal project is huge and is estimated to cost $722 million. In 1916, the United States signed a treaty with Nicaragua, acquiring the right to dig a canal for a price of $3 million. In addition, the United States can build naval bases in Fonseca Bay (in the Pacific Ocean) and Corn Islands (in the Caribbean Sea) belonging to Nicaragua. (Havas, 16th)

### Recent Situation of Strict Prohibition of Gambling and Opium in Beiping

Five Drug Dealers Executed by Firing Squad - Difficult to Eliminate Japanese Rogues Running Gambling Dens

Beiping Correspondence: Regarding the issue of drug prohibition, since the authorities were ordered to strictly enforce it, they have repeatedly posted slogans advising people to quit. In addition to the Eastern Great Earth Drug Rehabilitation Center, they have also established a large drug rehabilitation center at the Ten Thousand Poisons Temple, advising drug addicts to go there for rehabilitation. Beginning in 1937, the authorities ordered all police officers in the city to organize drug dealer search teams and patrol the city, hoping that drug addicts would make a final change of heart. In addition, those who were found to be addicted to drugs were immediately arrested. According to investigations, 30 people have been arrested in the past half-month, none of whom have been executed yet. However, the Northern Suburban District Office arrested a drug trafficker, Lu Louxin, last year. The authorities, in order to kill one as a warning to a hundred, specifically brought Lu to be executed by firing squad. Before being executed, he was put on a large open car, escorted by infantry and cavalry, and paraded through the important areas of the city before being executed by firing squad. On the 13th, the Military Law Department of the Ji-Cha-Sui Pacification Commissioner's Office then burned 80 cases of drugs seized from August 1936 to January of this year in front of the Temple of Heaven, a total of more than 200 catties of white powder, red pills, etc., worth more than tens of thousands of dollars. At the time of the drug burning, five drug dealers were also escorted to the drug burning site to watch the burning of the drugs, and then escorted to the Tianqiao execution ground to be executed by firing squad. It was found that the five drug dealers were not current prisoners arrested this year. Those arrested this year are still under investigation. The drug rehabilitation center was originally supposed to close at the end of last year, but those who voluntarily request rehabilitation can still be accommodated. This is the authorities' way of showing their final leniency in the midst of strict drug prohibition. The population of Beiping has reached more than 1.5 million, and drug addicts account for about 150,000, which is a staggering number. At this time of strict drug prohibition, drug addicts are still not reduced in number in order to satisfy their cravings. The authorities will seek effective methods to clear the atmosphere of drugs.

Regarding the issue of cracking down on gambling, since Korean rogues could no longer make a living by selling drugs, they changed their occupation to gambling. As a result, so-called game venues sprang up all over the southern city of the old capital. Every night, they were brightly lit, and there were even drums and horns playing. When they were first established, they were often full of customers, but now most of them are deserted. The authorities have repeatedly made representations to the Japanese side regarding the crackdown on such game venues. Although the Japanese side has agreed to assist, it has not been implemented. At the end of last month, it was rumored that they would be banned immediately, so one or two game venues closed down for a day, but then reopened. To this day, gambling has not been eradicated.

### Over a Hundred Merchants in Guangdong Province Petition

Requesting a Change in the New Standard for Assessing Business Tax - Presenting the Difficulties of Business and the Impracticality of the New Tax Regulations

Guangzhou Correspondence: All merchants in Guangdong Province oppose the Finance Department's change to using business turnover as the standard for tax assessment. The difficulties in implementing it have been repeatedly requested by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and representatives of various merchants to improve in order to alleviate the difficulties of business. However, the Finance Department, believing that the order cannot be retracted, has decided to implement it. All merchants, believing that the tax system is complicated and harsh, and that if it is implemented, they will only be waiting for death, have sworn to fight to the death in this life-and-death situation. In the name of over 120 trade associations, they have organized a joint office to oppose the new standard for assessing business tax, and have notified stores throughout the province to temporarily not declare the 26th year's business tax, pending a resolution. Even if the new regulations still assess tax according to capital, they must request a reassessment to eliminate the burden. Various merchants then appointed 20 to 30 representatives, publicly elected Zou Dianbang, the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, to lead the team, and brought a petition stamped with the seals of over 100 trade associations. At 4 p.m. on the 15th, they traveled as a group to the Finance Department to hold a large petition to abolish the new standard for assessing business tax. Finance Director Song Ziliang had heard about it in advance. Believing that the public was in a state of agitation and fearing that an incident would occur, he flew to Shanghai on a Douglas-style plane with his secretary Zhuang Shuxia at 10 a.m. on the 15th to temporarily avoid the storm and to visit the authorities of the Ministry of Finance to ask for instructions on how to handle the matter. Therefore, when the representatives of all the merchants arrived at the Finance Department by car with flags in hand to petition that afternoon, Finance Director Song Ziliang had already gone to Shanghai and could not be seen. Later, the Finance Department's Chief Secretary Gui Jingqiu and Section Chief Dong Zhongding represented Song in receiving the petitioning representatives. The business representatives elected Zou Dianbang as their spokesperson, forcefully stating the impracticality of assessing business tax based on business turnover. After Gui and Dong explained in detail and accepted the business community's petition, they advised them to wait quietly for the superiors to review and handle the matter. The business representatives dispersed at about 5 p.m. The main points of the business community's petition are excerpted as follows:

(Omitted above) ㊀ In terms of laws and regulations, Guangdong Province does have difficult circumstances. Article 4 of the promulgated Business Tax Law states that the tax standard shall be determined by the provincial and municipal governments in accordance with the nature and conditions of local businesses. In addition, the Ministry's measures for reorganizing business tax give the provincial and municipal governments the freedom to determine the tax standard and various tax rates, which are inherently flexible and have room for flexibility and how there are difficult circumstances, opinions can also be compiled and sent to the Ministry for review, etc. In terms of laws and regulations, it can be seen that the central government's original intention is not unchangeable, and the principle is very clear. The reason is that the businesses and operations of various places often have various differences due to local conditions and business habits. They must be adapted to local conditions in order to promote benefits to the fullest. The Ministry's order says that if there are still difficult circumstances, opinions can be compiled and sent for review, which largely implies the virtue of caring for business difficulties and clearly indicates that it is flexible and can be freely determined. ㊁ In terms of facts, Guangdong Province does have difficult situations. It is found that the merchants of this province have always been brave in donating and contributing. The number of donations and taxes in Guangdong is the highest in the provinces. Although the merchants are very difficult, they all follow the orders meticulously. Even when the business tax in Guangdong Province was first launched, it was based on the original outline, such as waiting for the completion of the tariff reduction before implementation. However, the government was anxious to carry it out. At that time, the likin tax had not yet been abolished. The merchants of this city were still struggling to do it. How could they be waiting and watching today? The current revision of the regulations has caused the merchants to rise up and fight for it. It is by no means an excuse to shirk. There must be difficult circumstances in this. Although they want to raise funds, they have no way to do it. The main points are two facts: A. Business strength is difficult to bear. It is found that the merchants of Guangdong province only seek to do more business and do not care about small profits. Sometimes they only break even. Even when they sell at a loss, they are determined to turn around and circulate. It is estimated that the most common businesses in the city are the sale of goods, the introduction and agency business, and the Zhuangkou business, accounting for about 80% of the city's stores. The wholesale businesses engaged in the sale of goods often have businesses of hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even millions of dollars. Even retail businesses must do tens of thousands of dollars of business to support their expenses. Now, according to the tax regulations, those with a business turnover of hundreds of thousands of dollars or millions of dollars should pay tens of thousands of dollars in tax, and those with a business turnover of tens of thousands of dollars should also pay hundreds of dollars in tax. However, if you investigate the business turnover of each store, you will find that there is no profit of tens of thousands of dollars or hundreds of dollars apart from expenses. Assuming there is a profit this year, how can you guarantee that there will be a profit next year? Collecting taxes every year can be expected to dry up quickly. For example, the flower yarn and food industries are related to the people's livelihood of clothing and food. The wholesale industry of these industries belongs to the Huasha, rice and bran, and Sanjiang gangs. The scale is relatively large. Each store has an annual turnover of 2 million yuan in yarn, but because of small profits and more business, the annual profit is not necessarily more than 10,000 yuan in pure profit. If the new regulations assess tax based on business turnover, calculating 5 per mille, it will cost 10,000 yuan in ocean dollars a year. Even if there is really a pure profit of 10,000 yuan, it will still not be enough to pay the tax. If the business can only maintain expenses, the capital of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan that has been accumulated will definitely disappear year by year due to tax payment. It can be asserted. Another example is the introduction and agency business, which belongs to the lines and columns of the industry. It is completely earning commissions, commonly known as Jiuba Hang. Every 1,000 yuan earns a commission of about 10 yuan, at most no more than 20 yuan. Now the current regulations collect 8 per mille, that is, 8 yuan is collected for every 1,000 yuan of business turnover, plus 12 yuan for ocean dollar water. Each store itself must also bear expenses and bad debts, and it can be asserted that it will lose all its capital due to tax payment. Another example is the brokerage Zhuangkou industry. Every 1,000 yuan earns only a few yuan in commission, or even a small amount of 1 yuan and several corners. The income is simply not enough to pay the tax, not to mention those who lose money in their business. Moreover, although the business habits in Guangdong province are that one kind of goods is often turned into several industries, there are wholesalers, retailers, processors, and distributors, which are scattered in the countryside in turn. Each time it passes through several hands, it is indirectly accessed by the consumer. It is a kind of goods business, and it pays business turnover tax three or four times for a small amount, and six or seven times for a large amount. Stripping off layers of skin, it is really impossible to bear. (B) It is difficult to pass on goods. Business does not take goods as the object, and it is not allowed to pass on goods according to law. However, since merchants have no power to bear heavy taxes, the trend will flow to passing on taxes. However, if the goods company passes on taxes several times, the prices of goods will rise day by day, and the people's lives will rise accordingly. The malpractices will be extreme. Moreover, the more it is passed on, the higher the cost, and the more difficult it will be to sell. The number of sales in this province will inevitably be reduced. As a result, wholesale and retail industries will inevitably have no business to operate. The large one will hinder the people's livelihood, and the small one will hinder the business. Heavy taxation is like mercury leaking to the ground, with no hole to enter. In terms of the environment, Guangdong province has special circumstances compared with other provinces. It is found that the new tax regulations this time are based on the fact that the business tax revenue of foreign provinces is more than that of Guangdong province. I don’t know that Guangdong is a border province, adjacent to tax-free ports such as Hong Kong and Macau, which is different from inland commercial ports. If the tax rate is too high, merchants will avoid the heavy and choose the light, and it is easy to move their business. Driving fish into the deep, it will only damage tax revenue. This is due to regional relations and cannot be generalized. (Omitted in the middle) The new regulations this time are indeed difficult and impractical in terms of facts and environment. Even if all the business income is exhausted, it is not enough to pay the tax. The profit of the fly head is limited, and the expansion of the melon vine is getting thinner and thinner, so it cannot but strongly request to withdraw the order. In recent years, business has been declining to the extreme. The outside is strong and the inside is dry, and eight or nine out of ten are like this. If the business turnover tax is enforced again, what is the difference from urging them to close down? There is no business to operate, so where is the tax? It is harmful to the national economy and the national tax source. The public opinion of the various merchants should be forwarded, together with the stamps of the various merchants, and sent to your office for review. It is hoped that you will consider the above reasons and immediately withdraw the order, and order the business tax bureau to approve and collect taxes according to the old amount in order to comply with business sentiment and stabilize business. I still pray to see the reply. Sincerely yours, Song, Director of Guangdong Finance Department. (January 15)

### Tragic House Collapse Injures People in Wuxi

In this city, Wang Binggen, a resident of Xichun River in the city center, operated a rosewood workshop there, employing fourteen workers. Yesterday morning (the 17th) at around 4 a.m., the house built behind the workshop suddenly collapsed, burying all the workers inside. People immediately rescued the workers from the rubble. However, worker Chen Jinshou suffered fatal injuries and died upon rescue. Worker Li A'er's right leg was also broken by the collapse. Apprentices Xu Tingda, Chen Xingsheng, and Liu Rongda suffered serious injuries and were immediately sent to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, Wu Shunqing, the head of the district, reported the incident to the court's prosecutor's office for inspection. Prosecutor Huang led officials to investigate the scene and instructed the deceased's family to prepare a coffin for burial. The homeowner, Hua Ganchen, voluntarily offered a compassionate payment due to the simple construction of the house. At the same time, the house of neighbor Gu Yunpeng was also pulled down, but fortunately, no one was injured.

### Tonight's Xiqing Basketball Xintong vs. Mailingjia Championship Finals

All Two Groups of Independent University Will Conclude Tonight

The Xiqing Basketball Tournament, which began on November 23rd of last year, has scheduled its 112th and final game to be played tonight. However, due to reorganization issues within the Ordinary Group, although the scheduled matches will conclude tonight, there remain two games: Muer vs. Chengxiong of the Leather Division, and Muer vs. Xari. According to the association's announcement, these games will be played after the conclusion of the Independent and University Groups. It is predicted that Muer can confidently win and claim the Leather Division championship. As for the Affection Division, although it has concluded, the Yuezhong, Tongwen, and Shell teams are tied with four wins and one loss each, necessitating a triangular round-robin to determine the champion, who will then compete for the overall championship with the Leather Division champion. Therefore, the overall conclusion date must be extended and cannot be completed today. The championship round-robin for the Affection Division of the Ordinary Group began the night before last (Saturday), with Tongwen defeating Shell 24-22. If Tongwen wins against Yuezhong, it will secure the right to the finals. There are three games tonight, after which both the Independent and University Groups will be completed. The schedule, starting at 7 p.m., features a make-up game between Tongji and Nanjin. It is expected that Nanjin will forfeit. At 8 p.m., Mailingjia will face Xintong, undoubtedly one of the most exciting matches of the season. Although Xintong has all but secured the Independent Group championship, their recent loss to the Military Academy has left the outcome uncertain. Whether they can maintain their winning streak will be determined in tonight's battle. Mailingjia has been in high spirits recently, and although they lost to Xintong 23-33 in their previous encounter, they will put in their full effort tonight. A victory would give them and Xintong an equal record of 11 wins and 1 loss, allowing them to share the championship. At 9 p.m., Qingguang will face the Xin Team. It is rumored that the Xin Team, out of mutual assistance, may give Qingguang a chance to escape the bottom spot. The schedule for each match is as follows:

Tongji vs. Nanjin (University) 7 p.m.

Mailingjia vs. Xintong (Independent) 8 p.m.

Qingguang vs. Xin Team (Independent) 9 p.m.

### Nearly an Accident Due to Carelessness, Donghua Wins 3-2 Against Xishang

Xishang Led 2-1 in the First Half

Although there was a slight rain all day yesterday, all Xilian football matches, except for the two morning league games at Hongkou Park which were postponed, proceeded as scheduled. Donghua faced Xishang at the Municipal Stadium in the second round of the Group A competition. Donghua initially faced a disadvantage due to playing against the wind, and further underestimated their opponent, leading to a 1-2 deficit in the first half. Ultimately, they only managed a narrow 3-2 victory, which was not as dominant as their 6-0 victory in the previous round. In another Group A match, St. Francis lost 0-4 to the well-rounded British Army R&R team, a result that was not anticipated after their 4-2 victory over Lax last week.

Donghua:

Sun Huizhang, Gu Shangxiang, Chen Zhenhe, Luo Haiguang, Zhang Rongcai, Li Yichen, Dai Linjing, Guan Xun'an, Wang Kehou, Sun Jinshun, Jia Youliang

Xishang Club:

Allison, Greenborough, MacLendru, Seth, Whitedenham, Jack, Eff, Grahame, Holenstenham, Meng Jinbo

Xishang Takes the Lead - After the kickoff, Donghua, facing the wind, had the right to attack first. However, the field was slippery, hindering their movements. The game remained even for about ten minutes, with both sides attacking and defending. Soon, Xishang launched a major offensive, and Zhang Rongcai's vision was blocked, allowing Xishang's right forward, Jinbo, to sneak a shot into the net, opening the scoring. About five minutes later, Xishang launched another major attack, and left forward Deluse seized the opportunity amidst the chaos to score another goal, putting Xishang ahead 2-0. Donghua realized that their opponent was formidable and could not be underestimated, so they proceeded with caution. However, the unfavorable conditions made it difficult to advance. Despite their efforts to create several good scoring opportunities, Xishang's goalkeeper, Shihuijidenhan, was agile and saved every shot. About a quarter of an hour before halftime, Luo Haiguang reached the goal. Shihuijidenhan rushed out to save, but Luo had already lifted his foot for a high shot, precisely hitting the crossbar. Their right defender, Holentongting, desperately tried to block it with his head, but it was too late. In his eagerness to save the goal, he used both hands to knock it down, resulting in a penalty kick. Sun Jinshun converted the penalty, ending the first half with a score of 1-2 in favor of Xishang.

Donghua Comes Back to Win - After the lemon, Donghua made major changes to their lineup. Gu Shangxiang took over as center back, and Li Yichen and Chen Zhenhe were moved to the front line to assist in the attack. Sun Huizhang and Luo Haiguang were moved to the positions of full backs. The changed formation of Donghua is as follows:

Chen Zhenhe, Luo Haiguang, Sun Huizhang, Li Yichen, Zhang Rongcai, Gu Shangxiang, Dai Linjing, Guan Xun'an, Wang Kehou, Sun Jinshun, Jia Youliang

The offensive suddenly became sharp, but because the Xishang goalkeeper was in good form, it was difficult to breach their defense. Not until twenty minutes later, Li Yichen quickly charged in and tripped their right inside forward. Dai Linjing then scored a shot from fifteen yards out, making the score 2-2. Two minutes later, Jia Youliang passed the ball to the center, and Sun Jinshun's powerful shot found the back of the net, putting them ahead 3-2 and securing the victory. Xishang also tried hard to counterattack, creating a dangerous situation in the last two minutes. When Toutuo Meng dribbled the ball for a shot, Luo Haiguang missed the clearance. Had it not been for Zhang Rongcai's quick eyes and hands, the game would have been tied. Fortunately, the whistle blew soon after, and Donghua won by a narrow 3-2 margin. Xishang's Jack was seriously injured.

Future Formation - In yesterday's game, Donghua, after being attacked repeatedly in the first half, was able to control the situation in the second half. Newcomer Wang Kehou, who is accustomed to playing center back in Java and is proficient with both feet, did not fully demonstrate his abilities in yesterday's game because he had not practiced for a long time and it was his first game in Shanghai. However, he did not neglect his duties, so the association will give him another one or two opportunities to test his ability to handle the position. Li Ning and Wan Xianghua have fully recovered from their injuries and are said to be able to play this week. Xu Yahui, due to poor eyesight, is not suitable for aviation and has withdrawn from the aviation school. He will come to Shanghai to find a job and officially join Donghua. According to a person who understands this matter, Donghua's forward line in the future will consist of Jia, Sun, Dai, Li, and Wan. The center back will be Yahui, with Shangxiang on the left. The right back will be determined based on Wang Kehou's performance. The back line will consist of Li Ning, Xun'an, and Rongcai, forming an ideal lineup.

Education News

### Taiwan Schools Abolish Chinese Language Classes

Vigorously Promote Japanese as the National Language

(Xiamen Communication) According to news from Taiwan, the entrance examination for secondary schools in Taiwan made Chinese language an optional subject. The Taiwan Governor-General's Office has now decided to abolish Chinese language classes entirely, implementing the amendment with Order No. 2 on the 15th. Currently, among the 625 public schools in Taiwan, only 24 in Taichung and 13 in Taipei have Chinese language classes. With this decision, Chinese language classes in the above schools will be completely abolished. According to statistics, the population of Taiwan is five million, of which only 200,000 are Japanese, mostly officials, military police, teachers, and civil servants. Among the remaining 4.8 million people, the Minnan Zhangzhou and Quanzhou people account for four million, the Guangdong people 500,000, the Fuzhou people 50,000 to 60,000, and the Taiwanese aborigines more than 200,000. The Min-Yue people from our country actually account for more than 90%, all of whom changed their nationality to Japanese when Taiwan was ceded to Japan after the Sino-Japanese War. After occupying Taiwan, the Japanese implemented colonial education, designating Japanese as the national language. However, due to the large Han population, Chinese language was still used by custom. To this day, Taiwanese newspapers still have a Chinese language edition. However, after forty years of Japanese suppression of Chinese language, such as Taipei Imperial University and vocational schools teaching entirely in Japanese, secondary schools also abolished Chinese language classes, and the entrance examination for secondary schools listed Chinese language as an optional subject. The so-called "public schools" are Japanese-style eight-year primary and higher elementary schools, which are the basic education for Taiwanese people. They originally taught Chinese language, but due to the suppression by the Japanese government, they have gradually abolished it. As a result, it is now completely abolished. The Japanese government has recently been vigorously promoting Japanese as the national language in Taiwan. For example, the "Taiwan Xinminbao" newspaper, which was originally mainly in Chinese language and secondarily in Japanese language, began to change to Japanese language as the main language in the second half of last year, and the Chinese language version was moved to the seventh and eighth pages as a supplement. Last year, when the Japanese Navy vigorously promoted the Southward Advance policy, Taiwanese people took the opportunity to advocate expanding Chinese language education, arguing that "the destination of the Southward Advance is South China and Southeast Asia, which are all in contact with the same race and use the same Chinese language of Min and Yue as Taiwanese people. In order to carry out national policy, Taiwanese people should be fully taught Chinese language." They made a very enthusiastic Chinese language movement, suggesting that the compulsory English course in secondary schools be changed to Chinese language, but it was not adopted by the Japanese government. After only two months of Admiral Kobayashi Seizō taking over as Governor of Taiwan, he took the decisive step of completely abolishing Chinese language classes in public schools. (January 17th)

### Social Education in Guangxi

Social education in Guangxi mainly focuses on mass education and stipulates that mass literacy and civic education should be implemented during the training of the people's militia and reserve forces. In addition, provincial libraries are established in Nanning and Guilin, and provincial stadiums are established in Nanning and Wuzhou. Counties also establish libraries and stadiums according to local financial resources, either independently or attached to central elementary schools or county secondary schools. The provincial government purchases the Wanyou Wenku and distributes it to various counties, and purchases the Congshu Jicheng and Tushu Jicheng and distributes them to secondary schools to enrich library facilities. Statistics show that there are 117 libraries attached to such mass guidance institutions in various counties. Two years ago, the province completely abolished all mass education centers, and the provincial mass education center in Nanning has been converted into the site of the National Basic Education Research Institute. The mass education centers in various counties have also been converted to other uses, but mass education is not neglected. In the above-mentioned mass education institutions, full attention is still paid to the popularization and living of education, and civic training is emphasized. The province has a provincial museum, established in July 1934. The museum is divided into two departments: history, culture, and natural sciences. The history and culture department includes literature production, historical documents, works of art, clothing, revolutionary souvenirs, national humiliation souvenirs, educational achievements of Guangxi Province, and patriotic education materials. The natural sciences department includes meteorology, geology, minerals, animals, plants, agricultural and industrial products, instruments, and models. There are 13 exhibition rooms, 5 sorting and research rooms, 2 reading rooms, 1 taxidermy room, 1 specimen storage room, and more than 10 other application rooms. The exhibits include ancient relics of Guangxi, such as bronze drums, ancient plaques, calligraphy and paintings of famous sages from past dynasties, and objects from the Miao and Yao ethnic groups, which are particularly noteworthy. In addition, there is special education in social education, which is aimed at the Miao and Yao people. The Miao and Yao people are widely distributed in the province, accounting for about two-thirds of the counties. There are no documents available for reference on the changes in their ethnicity. The Miao and Yao population, excluding those who live with the Han people, is about 200,000 to 300,000. Education is the most powerful way to improve their culture, improve their lives, and unify national will. In order to meet the needs, the provincial government has formulated a special education implementation plan as an implementation outline, and established a special education committee in the provincial government to be responsible for carrying it out. Special training classes are set up for special education teachers, and the provincial treasury designates special subsidies for Miao and Yao schools in various counties.

### Regulations for Subsidizing Elementary School Graduates in Various Counties and Cities of Fujian Province to Further Their Studies

The regulations for subsidizing outstanding and impoverished elementary school graduates in various counties and cities of Fujian Province to further their studies in secondary schools have been implemented this year. It is truly commendable that they benefit impoverished children and enable them to receive secondary education. The following is a summary of the regulations: ㊀ In order to encourage outstanding and impoverished students in counties and cities without public secondary schools in the province to further their studies, these subsidy regulations are specifically established. All counties and cities without public secondary schools should set up scholarship funds to send outstanding and impoverished students with household registration in the county or city to study at provincial secondary schools in other counties and cities. The scholarship funds will be allocated from the education funds of each county or city, up to 5%. ㊁ The selection of scholarship recipients is limited to elementary school graduates entering junior high schools, junior vocational schools, or simplified normal schools. Students who have already received scholarships and are promoted from junior high schools or junior vocational schools to senior secondary schools may continue to receive the scholarship if their average score in the graduation examination is 80 or above. ㊂ The number of scholarships will depend on the total amount of scholarship funds in each county or city. Those who pass the examination and enter junior high schools or junior vocational schools will be granted an annual scholarship of 100 yuan per student. Those entering simplified normal schools and receiving meal expenses from the school will be granted an annual scholarship of 80 yuan per student. The method of disbursement will be determined by the county and city governments. ㊃ Each county and city will hold a scholarship examination once a month before the start of each academic year. The types of schools and the number of students will be designated by the county and city governments and announced at the time of the examination. If the number of scholarships in each county and city is full, the aforementioned examination may be suspended and held again when there are vacancies. ㊄ When applying for the scholarship examination, students must submit a request form from their parents or guardians and find two reliable guarantors to issue a guarantee letter. ㊅ Before holding the scholarship examination, the county and city governments should earnestly review the family financial situation of the applicants and only allow those who are truly impoverished and unable to afford further education to take the examination. There are two criteria: 1. The student's family's monthly income is less than 30 yuan, and the expenditure can only meet the needs; 2. The student's family property is only enough for the necessary living expenses and there is no surplus. ㊆ The names of students who pass the review and are allowed to take the examination should be listed and announced by the county and city governments one week before the examination. If it can be proved after the announcement that they do not meet the standards for poverty, they can still be changed. ㊇ Both the officially selected and alternate students who pass the examination should apply to provincial secondary schools for study. If the officially selected students are not admitted, their qualifications for receiving the scholarship will be cancelled, and the alternate scholarship students who have been admitted by the provincial secondary school will be filled in order. ㊈ Each county and city government should submit a list of the names of the students selected in the examination and the schools they are attending to the Education Department for record one month after the start of the academic year. ㊉ At the end of each academic year, each county and city government should investigate the academic performance of the scholarship students. Those who are held back will be stopped from the next academic year; those who are suspended from school or withdraw from school due to illness will be stopped from the date of suspension or withdrawal. If they violate school rules and are expelled from school, the scholarship already received should be recovered from the guarantors. ㊉㊀ If it is found that a scholarship student's academic performance is too poor or that his family is not impoverished, the scholarship should be stopped.

### Key Points of Internship for Trainees in Employment Training Classes

The rules for the internship of trainees in employment training classes for graduates of junior college and above have been approved by the Executive Yuan meeting on the 12th.

No loans may be borrowed from the internship agency. ㊄ The daily work during the internship should be made into a report at the end of each month and sent to the committee for review. ㊅ The personnel and affairs of the internship agency should not be publicly criticized or expressed opinions to the outside world. ㊆ The performance will be assessed by the internship agency, and the committee may send personnel to inspect it at any time. If there is a major fault, the head of the internship agency may notify the committee at any time to stop or punish it. ㊇ The internship period is set for three months, and the internship agency will employ them after the expiration of the period, but if there is a vacancy during the internship period, it may be filled as soon as possible, and the committee should be notified.

### Outlook for the World Economy

— Zhang Baiyi

From the World Economic Panic to the World Military Boom

The universe endows mankind with the resources for life, but mankind uses these resources as resources for war, and mankind's life will of course feel panicked. In the four years from 1914 to 1918, the unprecedented war in the history of mankind appeared, resulting in the sacrifice of infinite production and productivity, and finally causing the initial cause of the world economic panic era in 1929. Although this world economic panic did not break out after the war, it occurred about ten years later. However, the so-called post-war boom that was maintained during these ten years was the artificial international credit expansion. The reason why the panic occurred later was the shrinkage of world purchasing power, which could not continue to maintain its credit expansion.

Originally, the world economy had shown a temporary reactionary boom after the war, but it still sank into the post-war panic between 1920 and 1924. By 1925, it gradually showed a boom. This was because the post-war European political situation gradually became stable, that is, the currency system and finances of European countries gradually got on the right track. With the Dawes Plan, the German reparations problem came to an end. Furthermore, the Treaty of Locarno established a guarantee of security. Therefore, European politics and economy gradually moved towards the road of stability. As a result, the United States and other countries loaned huge amounts of capital to poor European countries. European production and trade were improved, and world economic trade increased year by year, resulting in the post-war prosperity era until 1929. However, the economic reason for this kind of boom was purely the huge amount of capital output at this time, that is, the great expansion of international credit. At that time, the total amount of capital output of the world's major investment countries averaged 4 billion yuan per year between 1925 and 1929, an increase of 151% compared with before the war. Therefore, the expansion of world trade was also as high as 169% compared with before the war. However, this kind of boom was completely maintained by international finance. If such maintenance was hindered, of course, trade could be stopped immediately, and the so-called boom could immediately turn into smoke.

In the autumn of 1929, a credit panic occurred in the US stock exchange. The United States stopped lending funds, and the capital output of investment countries was also blocked. As a result, the markets for agricultural products and raw materials were in chaos, and the United States and other countries were in panic. Originally, after the war, all countries in the world were extremely poor. Although the United States took off as a result, its interests were all war debts of various countries, and the indebted countries relied on Germany's reparations. However, Germany's post-war poverty meant that no matter how much it was squeezed, it could not afford to repay its reparations. Only because of a temporary abstract political agreement, it obtained the guarantee of Man Gan credit. As a result, after five years, not only were the war debts not repaid, but also the released funds were like stones sinking into the sea. Of course, the US finance had to face a crisis. The world trade increased due to the expansion of credit, not due to the increase of world purchasing power, so it was bound to have loopholes.

The shrinkage of world purchasing power is reflected in the world trade as a continuous decline. That is, taking 1929 as 100, it fell to 68.5 in price, 84.5 in quality, and 58.0 in amount in 1931. At the same time that world capital output decreased, the world's recovery of credit also started from creditor countries. For example, France was recovered only 20 million US dollars in 1929, but the amount recovered in 1930 increased tenfold to 250 million US dollars.

The sharp decline in world trade triggered a world currency war. Countries stopped the gold standard one after another and implemented currency inflation to depreciate the value of foreign exchange in order to increase trade exports. In 1932, there were 35 countries that stopped the gold standard and 27 countries that implemented exchange management. On the other hand, in order to prevent foreign dumping, import restriction policies were implemented. For example, in the 16 months since September 1931, as many as 23 countries have implemented tariff increases, and 50 countries have implemented partial commodity tariff increases. As a result, world trade has been declining all the way.

In the summer of 1933, countries on the one hand tried to obtain a world economic peace plan, and on the other hand, they were unwilling to sacrifice their own vested interests. Therefore, although an international economic conference was convened in London, the result was only a tragicomedy of discord. Since the failure of the International Economic Conference, countries have been rearming and trying to seize markets by force or protect their colonial markets, thus creating a world military boom. Moreover, the scope of the world military industry is quite large, so it can temporarily stimulate the activities of the entire world economic mechanism.

▲ The Continuity of the World Military Boom from 1933 to 1937

To know that the world military boom manipulates the world economic mechanism, it is only necessary to observe the loss of connection between the world's production and consumption circles. According to the investigation of the German Bureau of Statistics, the world industrial production index, based on 1928, was 65.1 in 1932, increased to 74.7 in 1933, increased to 80.9 in 1934, and increased to 87.6 in 1935 (as of September). From 1932 to 1935, it increased by a huge 22.5%. However, according to the world trade price index investigated by the International Federation, based on 1928, it was 39.6 in 1932, decreased to 35.2 in 1933, decreased to 34.3 in 1934, and only increased to 34.7 in 1935, that is, 5.1% less in 1935 than in 1932. The sluggishness of the world consumption circle, according to the normal state, how can the production circle prosper? Originally, the military industry is a non-productive industry, so it is reflected in the world economy that the production circle and the trade circle are running in opposite directions. (Table 1)

(1) World Industrial Production Index and World Trade Index

In 1936, the industrial production index of various countries in the world, except for Austria and France, can be said to be generally rising. Especially Japan, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, Germany, etc., either appeared the highest record in history or the highest number since the war. For example, Japan's production index in August 1936 was 219, the highest number since 1920. Compared with 67 in January 1920, it increased more than three times. Britain's second quarter of 1936 was 115.5, the highest number since 1924. The United States' August 1936 was 90.8, the highest index since 1929. The Soviet Union's February was 351.9, the highest number since 1925. Germany's August was 110.0, the highest number since 1925. The following is a list of the industrial production index of various countries in the world: (Table 2)

(2) Table of Industrial Production Index of Various Countries in the World

(Note) China is based on the investigation of the Central Bank in the 22nd year of the Republic of China; Japan is based on the investigation of Toyo Keizai, based on June 1931; others are based on Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, League of Nations, based on 1929. ▲ is June.

### Production Table of Japan, Britain and the United States

The rise in the world industrial production index can be said to be a continuous phenomenon from 1933 to today in 1936. In the process of this phenomenon, there have been several battles for the armed seizure of the world's colonial markets. Originally, the military industry products of this non-productive industry must inevitably lead to the result of armed warfare due to excessive production. However, the world's colonial market already has its own masters, so these wars are not direct struggles with the countries in the world's colonial market, but struggles with their masters. In other words, it is the struggle between the new rising powers and the advanced powers. Therefore, although some countries have won these wars, they still have to try their best to expand their military preparations before directly fighting with their old masters. Needless to say, the owner country that lost the market also actively increased the production of military supplies and tried to ensure and recover the colonial market belonging to the country. The expansion of world military expenditure in 1936-37 is the above proof, and it is also the prelude to the continuous rise of the world industrial production index in 1937. The following is a list of world military costs: (Table 3)

Table of Total World Military Expenditure (Unit: Million US Dollars)

(Note) The military expenditures of the United States, Britain, Germany, Italy, Japan, France, etc. in 1936-37 were all increased compared with the previous year.

That is, the world military expenditure has been increasing all the way since 1933, and the world industrial production index has been rising all the way since 1933, which is directly proportional, which can be confirmed by this.

Due to the stimulus of the military boom, the business activity index of various countries has been rising all the way. Gradually, it has broken the historical record. For example, the business activity index of the United States, Britain and Japan, the three major trading countries in the world, has been rising all the way recently. The United States was 102.0 in September 1936, the highest number since February 1930. The United Kingdom was 112.6 in July 1936, the highest record since January 1924. Japan was 110.0 in August 1936, the highest index since 1920. (Table 4)

Prosperity Index of the United States, Britain and Japan

### Table of Prosperity Index of the United States, Britain and Japan

### Diagram of German Prosperity Index

### French Economic Indicator Chart

(Note): (United States data from The Annalist; United Kingdom data from The Economist Trace Supplement; Japan data from The Oriental Economist. All based on the normal state as a benchmark, but the original index for the United Kingdom is based on 1935.)

However, if these business activity indices are analyzed by industry, it can be readily discovered that the highest increases are in the production of military supplies and raw materials, and the consumption of goods needed in the production process of military supplies. For example, in the September 1936 U.S. business activity index, the crude steel production index was 108.9, an increase of 32% compared to 76.9 in September 1935, a sharp increase of 74.6% compared to 34.3 in September 1934, an increase of 46% compared to 62.9 in September 1933, and a sharp increase of 81.6% compared to 27.3 in September 1932. The pig iron production index in September 1936 was 107.5, a sharp increase of 39.2% compared to 68.3 in September 1935, and a sharp increase of 86% compared to 21.5 in September 1932. Needless to say, steel is an important raw material for the military industry, and everything from warships and airplanes to automobiles, tanks, armored trains, guns, and bullets relies on steel. What is even more noteworthy is the global automobile production in the United States. During 1932, the worst year of the world economic crisis, the automobile production index was only 24.6 in August of that year, but it increased to 64.6 in 1933, and then surged to 107.3 in August 1936. This is because automobiles are the main weapon in modern army ground warfare. The United Kingdom and Japan also show the same trend as the United States.

▲ Global Commodity Market Speculative Activity and its Trends

The increased demand for military raw materials due to the world military boom is reflected in the world commodity market through rising prices, needless to say, only for military raw material commodities. Conversely, the market prices of world agricultural commodities have been declining. For example, in terms of military industrial raw material commodities, the market price of New York electrolytic copper futures per pound reached a high of 7.5 US cents in January 1932, increased to 9 cents from July to October 1933, remained unchanged from June to December 1933, increased to 5.25 cents in October 1935, increased to 10 cents in October 1936, reached 10.5 cents on November 28, and had already increased to 11 cents by December 16. Also, the market price of London standard copper futures per ton reached a high of £34 and 7/32 in February 1934, a high of £36 and 11/32 in 1935, and surged to £46 and 3/8 on December 16, 1936. The market price of London lead futures per metric ton reached a high of £12 and 1/8 in February 1934, increased to £19 and 3/4 in October 1935, and surged to £26 and 1/16 on December 16, 1936. The market price of London zinc futures per metric ton reached a high of £15 and 7/16 in February 1934, increased to £17 and 11/16 in October 1935, and increased to £18 and 13/16 on December 16, 1936.

India Still Needs Silver

Reuters, Bombay, 16th. Mauvinjee Bank reported this week that rumors of the US Treasury Department’s lack of enthusiasm for continuing the silver purchase program have made the silver market feel uneasy, causing prices to fall. However, the fall has stimulated domestic demand and imports from London have suddenly increased because the Indian budget is about to be discussed. It is still widely believed that the silver import tax may be increased. Domestic demand this week averaged about 175 bars per day, with about 35,000 bars rolled over after February delivery.

Reasons for the High Price of Old Copper Coins

The exchange rate for copper coins on the market has recently reached 2,900 cash, with some even adding 20 cash. The use of one-cent copper coins seems to be increasing, but direct exchanges are difficult to obtain due to the short time and crowded lines. Indirect exchanges at cigarette paper stores require a small fee. Also, if everyone uses new copper coins, old copper coins, one or two, or even four or five, are not easily found for exchange. There are also rumors that since the price of copper is high, even though copper coins are not entirely copper, their inherent value is higher than before.

### Securities

Bond Market Went From Dull to Active Last Week

Market Prices Also Rose Slightly

Last week, the public bond market continued to be sluggish due to the chaotic situation. The market sentiment, which had been firm, gradually became scattered due to the contention between bulls and bears. Large traders also reduced their activity, and trading suddenly became quiet. Supply and demand on the trading floor were mainly swap transactions, and market prices changed very little, remaining in a fluctuating state. However, by the weekend, because there were still more than 26 million shares of term deposit accounts due this month, large traders were eager to close out their positions early, and the market sentiment rebounded, trending consistently upward. The prices of all unified bonds approached higher levels, entering a promising state. With only seven days of trading left for the January futures, the bond market is expected to break away from its sluggish state and move towards a brighter outlook before the deadline. Due to the high market price of Unified Class A bonds, financial institutions have gradually begun to release shares, causing the upward momentum to weaken. The course of the whole week is as follows: on Monday, the market was quiet and sluggish, with more retail investors buying in, and market prices all rose. Trading was extremely quiet on Tuesday, with a fluctuating trend. The market sentiment became more scattered on Wednesday, with market prices rising and falling by only a fraction. On Thursday, bulls and bears gradually engaged in swaps, and the market also saw an increase. On Friday, the market was slightly lively due to swaps by large traders, and unified bonds continued to rise by one or two fractions. On Saturday, the market suddenly became active as large traders such as Nos. 11, 43, and 50 began to absorb shares. Market prices gradually rose by one or two fractions to as much as half a yuan.

The overall result for the week was an increase of half a yuan to one yuan for unified bonds, while Class A bonds improved by a little over one-tenth. The total trading volume was 28,635,000 yuan. The comparison of price increases and decreases is shown in the table on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).

### Cotton Yarn

American Cotton Still Waiting for Government Stock Cotton to be Sold

Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with a firm trend, with prices rising by one to three points for each month. In the early morning, domestic traders bought near-month contracts, and foreign firms bought far-month contracts. However, due to large-scale profit-taking by bulls, market prices did not fluctuate much. Most domestic traders are waiting for progress on the government's stock cotton disposal. Cloth sales were brisk again this week, with high-grade spot cotton prices firm, and low-grade prices slightly softer. At the close of the market, the market sentiment was firm due to slight purchases by domestic traders and cooperatives. Spot prices rose by three points, and futures prices rose by one to three points. British cotton spot prices rose by two points, and futures prices remained unchanged. Indian cotton initially fell due to short sellers selling heavily, but was then partially bought back. Subsequently, the market stabilized with purchases by brokers. Pingguoer fell by 1 to 1.25 rupees, Aomura fell by 0.75 to 1 rupee, and Bairoxi fell by 0.75 rupees. Original telegram recorded (16th telegram).

According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the 18th is Bairoxi at 228.5 rupees, Aomura at 205.25 rupees, and Pingguoer at 181.5 rupees, all up by 0.25 rupees.

Japanese Exchange Control Unlikely to Affect Indian Cotton

The sharp rise in Japanese yarn at the beginning of the week triggered short covering. Subsequently, long positions were taken to realize profits. Although Lancashire and the mainland were quiet, Japan had a large volume of transactions. However, due to limited shipping space, January's transportation failed to set a new record. The recent Japanese control of foreign exchange is not expected to cause Japanese yarn mills to reduce their purchases of Indian cotton. Arrivals in various locations, except for Bairoxi, are still very high. The weekly statistics are attached below (unit: thousand bales).

### Grain

Bai Jing Varietal Weakens by a Small Fraction of a Yuan

The Association of Traders’ Retail Sales Also Changed by a Small Fraction of Two角

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, seventeen or eighteen boats arrived from various places along the river. Sales of various goods in the market were slightly weak. Because there is still a large inventory along the river, the price of Bai Jing varietal weakened by a few 分 to nearly one 角. The price of Bo Dao was flat and weak, the price of Zao Dao was slightly looser, and the price of Yangbu Dujian softened by five or six 分. The Bian Yuan varietal was plentiful and the price was short by about one 角. The prices of the remaining types of rice showed a slight loosening trend.

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of thirty boats arrived from various sources, carrying a total of six thousand three or four hundred shi. Among them, sixteen or seventeen boats carried Bo Dao. The sales market in this street was particularly sluggish, and the Bao Zhou was also not active. Only the Qingdao Yantai gang handled more than two thousand packages of Bo Dao. Therefore, the market situation ultimately felt lackluster. Fortunately, the arrivals were limited. As a result, the Bo Dao market price remained unchanged, and the Hou Jing was slightly modified by a few 分. The arrival and sales of Du Yangjian and Yin Bian Yuan were both scarce, and the quality was mediocre.

### Sugar Market

Sugar Inventory in this City Reduced by More Than 50,000 Pieces

(As of January 16)

### Statistics

December 1936 (Continued)

Shanghai Price Index

Reaches the Highest Level Since 1932

㊁ Export Price Index: The general index was 102.9, an increase of 6.0% compared to the previous month, and an increase of 143% compared to the same month last year, the highest peak since December 1931. Comparing the three categories of indices with the previous month, all rose, with raw materials and manufactured goods increasing the most. The raw materials index rose sharply by 7.0%, of which minerals rose by 12.6% and agricultural products rose by 6.3%, because market prices for cottonseed, cottonseed cake, coal dust, general coal, sesame, wheat, peanuts, and raw kernels all surged. The manufactured goods index rose by 7.0%. Soybean oil surged along with the Lian city by 17%, and raw oil also rose sharply in tandem. Asphalt and tung oil prices rose along with cotton yarn because the Yangtze River was shallow, the source was scarce, and exports were smooth. The consumer goods index rose by 1.3%. Although the prices of many goods rose, the goods with larger weighting, such as green tea, silk, and crepe, fell slightly, so the index did not rise much.

㊂ Import Price Index: The general index was 147.6, an increase of 3.3% compared to the previous month, and an increase of 4.3% compared to the same month last year, the highest record since 1931. Comparing the two categories of indices with the previous month, all rose, with the rise in raw materials and manufactured goods being particularly strong. The raw materials index rose by 6.1% due to the rising sales prices of wheat, coal, cotton, copper, lead, and timber. The manufactured goods index rose by 4.1%. The goods with sharply rising market prices, in addition to metals, were glass, foreign paper, and coconut oil, each rising by 5% to 16%. The consumer goods index rose by 1.8%, the lowest rate of increase among the three categories, because there were more items with no change in market price.

㊃ Cost of Living Index: The general index was 117.5, an increase of 0.3% compared to the previous month, and an increase of 7.5% compared to the same month last year. The increase was less than in the various other indices, because the responsiveness of retail market prices is usually slower. However, this month's index has also reached the highest level since October 1934. Comparing the various categories of indices with the previous month, all rose except for rent and miscellaneous items, which remained unchanged. The clothing index rose by 6.0%, with coarse cloth, fine cloth, twill cloth, and cotton drill all rising sharply in line with wholesale market prices. The food index rose by 3.4%. Beef, flour, soybean oil, and white rice rose in line with wholesale prices. Spinach, fresh fish, and chicken and duck eggs also surged. The fuel index rose by 1.4% due to the sudden rise in coal balls and the slight rise in kerosene. (To be continued)

Spring and Autumn

### Purpose

— (Jiao Shijie)

Whatever you do, you must have a purpose.

Follow the guiding principle of the purpose, and proceed step by step, and you will surely achieve the purpose and complete the purpose.

There are bound to be many obstacles hindering the process of achieving the purpose.

Purpose is an estimated hope.

Hope without estimation is wishful thinking. Wishful thinking is not purpose.

Purposeful results are successful! The result of wishful thinking is frustration and failure.

Purpose enables society to constantly advance.

Purpose can improve people's work spirit.

Purpose can make people feel happy.

Achieving purpose is the greatest happiness of mankind.

### Wang Boling and the Nuns and Monks of Yangzhou

— Truth

Wang Boling, a member of the Central Committee and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, has converted to Buddhism in recent years and is a very pious layman. When Chairman Chiang flew out of Xi'an and returned safely to Luoyang, Wang especially rushed to express his regards and mentioned the prayers of the people throughout the country. In addition to the prayers of Christians, Catholics, Muslims, and Lamaists, the efforts of the nuns and monks of Yangzhou County should also not be ignored. Wang, with sincere gratitude, personally wrote an article to express his thanks to the nuns and monks. The original text is recorded below:

"I have investigated that when Chairman Chiang was in distress in Xi'an, I made a request to the chairman of the Buddhist Association on the 14th to inform all the major monasteries and small temples to have all the nuns and monks sincerely recite the holy name of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, hoping for blessings for three days, and then temporarily stop reciting. Especially during the precepts transmission period in the Jingzhong Law Temple, hundreds of new initiates were able to sincerely pray and make vows, mournfully and earnestly, from dusk to dawn. The power of the prayers of more than ten thousand people should not be ignored. It is known that the situation of the Chairman was most dangerous during the three days from the 12th to the 14th, and his safety was not determined until the 15th. The nationwide people's prayers were powerful. The sincere recitations of our Yangzhou nuns and monks are also not insignificant. Now that the Chairman has safely returned to Nanjing, I sincerely thank everyone and hope that we can all share the wisdom of the Buddha."

When Wang began to lead the nuns and monks throughout the county in reciting Buddhist mantras in Yangzhou on the 14th, it was rumored that Dai Jitao, the President of the Examination Yuan, was also reciting Buddhist mantras in Beijing. However, this is not accurate, as Dai was actually shouting impassioned slogans during the Central Memorial Week at that time.

### Hot Water Bottle

— Zhou Xian

Winter is here, and hot water bottles are on the market again. Red, green, and yellow, they come in a variety of colors, displayed invitingly in the windows of department stores. At the same time, in the slender hands of young women, hidden in beautiful silk handkerchiefs, are always hot water bottles filled with warmth.

Although young women are not afraid of the cold, they would rather wear only silk stockings on their legs in winter and endure the cold, allowing chilblains to grow, but they take special care of their jade-like hands. After late autumn, not touching cold water goes without saying. Even when hiding in a room with a stove or radiator, they still feel it is not enough, and must have a hot water bottle. Although their hands are busy knitting wool clothes, or touching mahjong tiles, or doing other things, and in fact, there is no time to hold the hot water bottle, if the nanny forgets to pour hot water into the bottle, she will be immediately scolded. Therefore, some people say that the hot water bottle is simply a winter decoration for young women, and warmth is only a side effect. I think this is very true, because in fact, only one or two out of ten use a hot water bottle to keep warm. If you are at home or out and about without carrying a hot water bottle, you will be ridiculed for having a bit of a poor look. At the very least, it seems that you have not fully equipped yourself for winter, and there are some flaws in your beautiful appearance.

A hot water bottle is originally just one of the winter supplies, but sentimental people will have fanciful thoughts, associating it with passion. They say that the hot water bottle is warm, symbolizing the passion of a young woman, and can give people a lot of stimulation and excitement. However, as far as I can see, this is not very reliable. The passion of a young woman is very reserved, and definitely not as scalding hot as a hot water bottle. The passion of a young woman is relatively long-lasting, unlike a hot water bottle that easily cools down. Therefore, I say that a hot water bottle is somewhat like a harlot. When you first touch it, it is so surprisingly hot that it makes you feel unexpectedly satisfied, but after a short while, it gradually goes from hot to warm, and from warm to cold. This is just like the passion of a harlot, which cools down after a short time. Therefore, it is inappropriate to symbolize a young woman with a hot water bottle. The representative of a young woman should not be a hot water bottle, but a thermos. At the same time, the fate encountered by a hot water bottle is very similar to that of women who are treated as toys by humans. In winter, when people need it, it is treated like a treasure, indispensable for a day. When spring returns and the weather warms, it is abandoned and ignored, not as good as a thermos, which can store both hot and cold, and can be used all year round, just like a good housewife.

Therefore, in winter, whenever I see the birth of a hot water bottle, I always have a feeling, grieving for the fate of the unfortunate hot water bottle after two or three months. But at the same time, I also always feel that the hot water bottle is too quick to cool down its passion. With such a temperament, it deserves to be abandoned.

### Breaking Through Difficulties

### Winter at Songkou

— Zhu Ying

Although coal prices are soaring, black smoke keeps pouring out of the chimneys of the stoves in the neighborhood. Surrounded by this dense coal gas, I felt like I was about to suffocate. So, one Sunday morning, I secretly slipped away to Wusong.

When the Songhu train stopped at the Paotaiwan station, only eleven people got off, and I was the only one heading towards the sea. As I slowly walked to the seaside, although Lion Forest was still squatting on the muddy ground, and the towering lighthouse was still standing straight at the end of the long dike, the sea was still crashing against the seawall with such a strange force, the total number of tourists was less than forty. Scattered, it was unknown how many tens of times less than in April and May. What made me feel even more uncomfortable was that among these thirty-odd people, about twenty were foreigners sitting on the ground with lunch boxes and water bottles. Four or five were white. The number of Chinese was only a little over ten.

Standing by the seawall, quietly watching the sea outside the mouth, the azure blue seawater felt exceptionally comfortable in my eyes, which were filled with red veins from being immersed in the turbid currents of the Huangpu River. The faint sunlight shone on the slightly wrinkled sea surface, creating threads of golden yellow. From time to time, a pair or two of eagles would skim over the waves. Apart from occasionally seeing this beautiful scene in colored scenery or films, this can be said to be the first time I have appreciated it in the true natural environment. Although I must roam the mouth of Wusong in spring and autumn, such colors can probably only be manifested under the faint sunlight in winter—because what I see in spring and autumn are only the reflecting lights that sting my eyes.

On the way from Songkou to Wusong, I passed a farmhouse. In order to beg for a match to light a cigarette, I started talking to an old farmer. From the remains of the trenches under the seawall, we talked about the January 28th Incident, his two sons who were sacrificed in the artillery fire, and his three thatched huts. Then we talked about his fruit stall that he depended on for a living. Finally, he sighed and said that the northwest wind had driven away the tourists, indirectly causing him to stop doing business. But the old couple had to eat and drink. In his trembling voice, he told me that he had not eaten anything for a day and a night. Two lines of clear tears then climbed onto his cheeks.

Unable to contain my sympathy, I gave him the four 毛 I had prepared to go to Wusong town for dinner. But at that time, only the fare back to Shanghai remained in my pocket.

### Wine, Women, Wealth, and Temper

— Manzi

Chinese idioms often consist of four characters, such as "wind, flowers, snow, and moon," "boiling, frying, stir-frying, and roasting," "trauma injuries," etc., all of which are refined from a partial situation. Therefore, by mentioning four characters, the whole can be generalized. For example, the general outlook on life always uses the four characters "wine, women, wealth, and temper" to encompass everything.

The General Dictionary of Common Words says: "In the Later Han Dynasty, Yang Bing once said, 'I have three confusions: wine, women, and wealth.' Nowadays, people add temper, and it has become a common saying, probably starting from the Ming Dynasty." So the greatness of the influence of these four characters has been true since ancient times, and is even more intense today. Why was the character temper added in the Ming Dynasty? Is it possible that people before the Ming Dynasty still had considerable control over their temper? However, many great Confucian scholars discussed temper in great detail. Confucius' "When young, the blood and energy are vigorous, guard against strife." and Mencius' "Nurturing my noble spirit." are the most prominent evidence. In fact, wine, women, and wealth are all driven by temper. Without temper, they would not be expressed so vividly.

Novels and dramas are reflections of fragments of life. What they depict are just the most brilliant parts. One, two, or three of the four characters wine, women, wealth, and temper is enough, and it is not necessary to write all of them. Like chapter novels, the plot is more complicated and tortuous, and some write all four characters. Novels that write all four characters are sure to be very moving.

Now I have seen a movie that writes all four characters, which is "Eternal Smile." Wang Xianzai's wine, from intoxication to semi-wakefulness, gradually opens up his reason in an orderly manner, which proves that he has a very thorough understanding of the psychological state of drunkenness. Xu Xinyuan's women, from initial thoughts to fulfilling desires, used many different methods and changed many different poses, and also achieved considerable success. As for wealth controlling Gong Jianong's studies, Shu Xiuwen's private property, Wang Ruoxi and Gong Qiuxia's departure, and Hu Die's murder. Linked to wealth is the relationship formed by temper. Thus, this story is completely manipulated by the four characters wine, women, wealth, and temper, making it topsy-turvy and confusing. Therefore, "Eternal Smile" really has the thread of a chapter novel, which is refined to become a high-quality film.

### War Songs

— (Shen Li)

The cold wind cuts the face like a sharp knife,
The freezing snow hardens clothes like iron.
Thinking of national hatred, the heart's blood boils,
In the sound of drums and trumpets, the spirit is dauntless.

For a long time, we despised Wu Sangui's begging for surrender,
We should pity Shi Jingtang for his shamelessness.
Just knowing to rush forward to kill the enemy,
Only then does a man reveal his noble character.

We share the same feelings of patriotism,
Not for official rank, not for fame.
Ashamed to share the same sky with cunning barbarians,
We go to the military gate vying to ask for a long tassel.

Boiling beans with stalks should not be praised,
The five races have always been one family.
Not allowing an inch of land to be abandoned,
Swearing to annihilate tigers and monsters and behead long snakes.

The silver light of the lion's eyes is boundless,
Ice forms peaks and snow forms carpets.
This is the clean land of China,
Not allowing even a moment of mixing with barbarian filth.

The fragrant and foul, obedient and rebellious, have not been distinguished,
The small clowns dare to play with soldiers in the pond.
Do they know that Korea has left a lesson,
Willing to be puppets, how pitiful!

Gathering rice to form a map, the subtlety is extreme,
The commander makes a decision in the tiger tent,
Connecting pearl giant cannons shake mountains,
Blood rain rustles, ten thousand points fly.

The badger becomes a bear, merely suffering itself,
A lone pig bites a tiger, how stubborn!
Heaven publicly shows the image to clear the demons,
The sun shines brightly in the sky, haloing a jade ring. (Returned Verse)

### Changing Nests and Mating Phoenixes

— By Zhang Henshui

Chapter Ten (A Silk Handkerchief Conveys Lingering Love, a Strange Piece of Writing Casts a Shadow; Chrysanthemums Face a Withered Autumn Heart, Adding to the Sorrow)

Youmei chatted with Old Madam Zhang in her room for quite a while. Later, she said she wanted to go to her cousin's room to borrow writing materials to write a few words. Since Old Madam Zhang didn't object, she leisurely walked to Guoqi's study. At the doorway, she even stopped to ask, "Is Cousin home?" Then she entered the room. She saw the desk wiped clean, the inkstone and water container neatly arranged, and sat in his chair. She used her hand to flick the tips of the grass in the small cattail grass pot and touched the plaster statue of Venus. She said to herself, "This person is really extremely refined." Then she lowered her head and saw a crack in the middle drawer. Unintentionally, she pulled the drawer open. There was a letter lying on top of some documents. On the front of the envelope was written, "Please forward to Zhijun." When she picked it up, it was already sealed, but there was no need to guess; she knew it must be entrusted to Menglan. She tossed it up and down in her hand a couple of times, then put it down again. Just as she was about to let go of the letter, she caught a glimpse of a note with a few lines partially visible, which read, "My respect for her is like the Buddha, my love for her is like a flower, my exclusive appreciation of her is like the moon." Youmei's heart skipped a beat. This note was in the drawer; wasn't it meant for her? With her heart pounding wildly, she picked up the note with both hands to read. Starting from the beginning of the note, although it didn't specify who it was for, who else came to this room? And would his lofty gaze even notice an ordinary woman? The further Youmei read, the happier she became. When she was about to finish the last two lines, Aunt Liu brought in a bowl of tea. Youmei didn't expect that she couldn't read, so she immediately crumpled the note in her hand and nodded at her, smiling, "There's no need to be so polite; I just had tea." Aunt Liu placed the teacup on the table and asked, "Does Miss Li want a fan?" Youmei said, "You don't need to be so polite… Alright, you can bring one." Aunt Liu turned to leave. Youmei didn't dare to look at the note again, but folded it carefully and put it in her pocket. Aunt Liu brought the fan, and Youmei took it and said with a smile, "Look, I came to this room to write, but sitting here, I'm just daydreaming and haven't written a single word." Aunt Liu said, "What's the rush? The master isn't back, and the seat is empty here. You can write as long as you like." As she spoke, she left. Youmei didn't dare to open the middle drawer anymore. From the drawer next to it, she took out a sheet of eight-lined paper, placed it in front of her, and stared blankly for a while. Then she slowly prepared the ink and took up the brush, doing everything slowly. 䀶 可 望 了 的 將 筆 管 頂 端 ， 不 住 的 碰 了 自 己 的 嘴 唇 。 (123)

Special Feature

### Flying to the Capital

— By Dai Yuren

Because I wanted to experience aviation for the first time in my life, I hurriedly drove to Longhua Airport in the early hours of the morning, before dawn, to catch the China National Aviation Corporation plane. Upon arrival, I presented my ticket for verification, weighed my luggage (each passenger is allowed fifteen kilograms of free luggage; overweight is charged), and also weighed the passengers. I then handed my binoculars to the clerk and received a numbered certificate (airplane passengers are not allowed to use cameras and binoculars on the plane). After completing all the procedures, I entered the airport and boarded the plane, taking my assigned seat. The plane I was on this time was a Douglas large aircraft, with fourteen seats arranged on both sides, leaving an aisle in the middle for free movement. Each seat was a very comfortable soft chair, and sitting by the window, one could look out at the scenery. Above the window, there were ventilation equipment and a wire mesh rack for storing small items. At the back was a restroom, and behind that was the cargo hold. In the front was the cockpit, with the words "Passengers Keep Out" written on the door, so I couldn't see what was happening in the cockpit. This plane itself weighed twelve thousand pounds, carried a load of six thousand pounds, and accommodated two pilots, one radio operator, and one attendant. It flew at a speed of one hundred and eighty-four miles per hour, consuming about one hundred gallons of gasoline per hour. Because the fuselage was huge, there was an engine on each side. This time, there were seven passengers, including the reporter and his wife. Four of them were Westerners, two of whom were going to Chongqing, and the rest were going to the capital. The plane first turned around, then taxied along the field. Without realizing it, I looked out the window and saw a small Longhua Pagoda below, which was when I knew we had already taken off. The crisscrossing roads, three-dimensional buildings, and trees were all shrunk down, and they were all upside down. If I were to greet a friend on the ground at this moment, I could truly address them as "Your Excellency at my feet." The bustling Shanghai disappeared in no time. The fertile fields, with their brown hues, flew by piece by piece. In the rivers, like long snakes, there was occasionally a steamer pulling seven or eight cargo ships, which looked like a few sections of lotus root. The sailboats in the lakes were as small as the toy boats that children play with in the pond in Zhaofeng Park. The mountains were as small as artificial hills, and the plane flew over them lightly, without any effort. The clusters of houses, which were villages or cities, were all shrunk down as if they were models of houses seen at a construction exhibition. Clouds brushed by in patches. The most Yue-like (referring to the Yue region, including parts of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian) scene was when we passed a place with a vast expanse of thin white clouds, spread flat in the air, just like a layer of window screen. The plane flew over these clouds, and the ground below was faintly visible. Its area was very large, truly like a curtain hung in the sky. All of humanity's endeavors on the ground and the natural landscape, as well as the strange sights in the air, can be seen at a glance from the plane. The attendant brought a cup of coffee and a bag of biscuits. Not long after I finished eating, I saw the layers of mountain peaks in front gradually enlarging, and at the same time, the speed of the flight felt a little slower. At this time, the plane broke into the city walls of the capital, and descended in the manner of an elevator stopping several times, landing at Ming Palace Airport. The time was only one hour and fifteen minutes, which was extremely fast and very comfortable. It was truly enjoyable, and three-quarters faster than the current capital express train.

I believe that as people's understanding of air transportation gradually becomes clearer, more and more passengers will take airplanes. Air transportation will have unimaginable development. The reporter considers himself to have already experienced this short-haul flight.

### Zhang Qun Returned to Nanjing Yesterday

Will Come to Shanghai Again in Two Weeks for Treatment of Nasal Ailment

Zhang Qun, Minister of Foreign Affairs, came to Shanghai at the end of last year to seek medical treatment for a long-standing ailment. After more than ten days, he has shown improvement and returned to Nanjing by train at 4:00 yesterday afternoon to preside over the ministry's affairs. He is scheduled to come to Shanghai again in two weeks for treatment. Regarding Zhang's condition, according to Vice Minister Chen Jie, who spoke to a reporter from the Central News Agency, Zhang has been diligently handling diplomatic affairs for the past six months, causing him to feel unwell from time to time. Therefore, he took advantage of his free time to come to Shanghai for medical treatment of his nasal ailment and to have a physical examination. Zhang's nose was injured during his military service years ago, making him prone to catching colds and bleeding easily. The examination revealed that the cartilage inside his nostrils was too large and needed to be reduced with an electric grinder. Surgery has been performed for several days, and it has been reduced considerably, but further treatment is needed. The results of the physical examination indicated that his stomach was weaker.

### International Academic Societies and Others Telegraphically Request Strict Punishment of Zhang Xueliang

And Suppression of Yang and Yu's Rebellion

The Chinese International Academic Society, the Shanghai Social Education Society, and the Shanghai Art Education Society jointly telegraphed the Central Government yesterday, requesting strict punishment of Zhang Xueliang and swift suppression of the rebellion of Yang and Yu, in order to prevent the resurgence of the Red Scourge, the devastation of the region, and the setback of defending the frontier and resisting the enemy. The text of their telegram is recorded below: To all newspapers nationwide, and for the attention of the Party headquarters, governments, schools, and organizations in all provinces and cities: We recently sent a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Military Affairs Commission, which stated: "Since the pacification of Guangdong and Guangxi, military and political orders have finally been unified nationwide. Our Central Government is using the strength of the entire nation to suppress the bandit and rebel armies in Suiyuan. As the military forces move, reports of victories are frequent, and the people of the whole country are overjoyed and encouraged, believing that this is the key to the Republic of China turning from weak to strong. Unexpectedly, news of the Xi'an Incident arrived, with the seizure of the leader and the attempt to overturn the foundation of the country. Although Zhang Xueliang has escorted Chairman Chiang back to Nanjing, his depravity and madness are universally condemned by the people. Although the government ordered that the laws be rectified, leniency was shown, with a ten-year sentence reduction and a special pardon. However, can a wolf have a change of heart and truly repent? Outwardly respectful, inwardly treacherous, he secretly ordered Yang and Yu to incite rebellion in the Northwest. If he is not publicly punished, how can we punish the wicked and uphold the law? Yang and Yu did not appreciate the Central Government's leniency in removing them from their posts and allowing them to remain, but instead spread false doctrines and joined forces with the Reds to incite chaos. They should be suppressed by explicit order in order to stop the source of chaos. The national situation is so precarious that we cannot allow national traitors and collaborators to linger for even a day. The national policy of resisting foreign aggression, saving the country, pacifying the interior, and expelling foreign enemies must be implemented to the end, so that the Red flames in the Northwest will not rekindle, and the previous efforts to defend the frontier and resist the enemy will not be wasted. The nation will be fortunate, the country will be fortunate."

### Current Affairs

### Talk by Vice Minister Chen Jie

Escorting Foreign Nationals in Shaanxi and Gansu is Under Negotiation; Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Issues are Not Discussed for the Time Being

According to the Central News Agency, Chen Jie, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 16th for a medical examination and is scheduled to return to Nanjing by train tomorrow morning. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Chen at his private residence yesterday morning, and he spoke as follows:

Escorting Foreign Nationals

There are approximately forty foreign nationals in Xi'an, mostly from Britain, America, France, and Germany. Except for the German nationals, who have completely left the country, the rest are still residing in Xi'an. The majority of those in Shaanxi and Gansu are religious followers. As for the method of escorting the foreign nationals out of the country, it is currently under discussion. Whether to transport them by car to Huaxian and then to Nanjing and Shanghai, or to escort them by plane, has not yet been decided. In short, the Ministry hopes that Yang and others will safely escort the foreign nationals in Shaanxi and Gansu out of the country as soon as possible.

Situation in Shaanxi and Gansu

The Central Government's approach to Shaanxi and Gansu has always been one of great leniency. If Yang and others can prioritize national and public interests, a peaceful resolution is still possible. Mi Chunlin and Bao Wenye have been traveling between Nanjing and Shaanxi in recent days, conveying opinions, and there is still hope for peace.

Sino-Japanese Negotiations

When asked whether Sino-Japanese diplomatic issues would be discussed soon, Chen said that, in his opinion, it was unlikely to proceed for the time being. This is because our country's Third Plenary Session is scheduled to open, and the Japanese Diet's annual session will also be held. Therefore, further discussions will be decided after the closing of the two major conferences in China and Japan.

Diplomatic Personnel Changes

Chen continued, (1) Italian Ambassador to China, Lojacono, has been transferred to Brazil as Ambassador and will leave China soon. His replacement has been internally selected as Cara, and our country has agreed. The announcement will be made soon. (2) The issue of upgrading diplomatic representation between China and Belgium was mentioned before the departure of Belgian Minister Jules Guillaume. Whether it can be realized immediately is difficult to determine. (3) Our Minister to Turkey, He Yaotsu, requested leave to return home and resigned from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but he has been persuaded to stay. He said that domestic affairs still need to be handled, and the date of his return is uncertain. (4) Our Minister to Austria, Liu Chongjie, was ordered to return home and left Austria on November 3rd of last year. He is currently staying in Germany for medical treatment due to illness. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Sino-Austrian affairs are not very numerous and has appointed Tong Degan as Chargé d'Affaires in Austria. Tong served as Chargé d'Affaires in Austria for many years before Liu took office and is very familiar with the situation in Austria. He has now taken office.

### Shanghai Cultural Circles Express Unified National Salvation Views

Symposium Held at the YMCA in Baixianqiao Yesterday, Chaired by Director Pan, Attended by More Than 100 People from Cultural Circles

According to Shanghai News, the China Cultural Construction Association invited prominent figures from Shanghai's cultural circles to a tea party at the YMCA in Baixianqiao yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. to jointly discuss and express their views on the recently published Declaration on Unified National Salvation. There was a common principle among them, which was that unified national salvation should be regarded as a matter of course, with no room for reservation. The details are recorded as follows:

List of Attendees

Including Pan Gongzhan, Tao Baichuan, Tong Xingbai, Zhang Shouyong, Li Quanshi, Xu Jiqing, Qian Xinzhi, Fu Donghua, Qin Runqing, Chen Guangfu, Wang Boqi, Fan Zhongyun, Zhang Yousan, He Bingsong, Zhang Sumin, Pan Gongbi, Qian Cangshuo, Yuan Yeyu, Zhao Jingshen, Ouyang Yuqian, Zhang Shuliang, Hu Zhengzhi, Gu Zhongyi, Li Haoran, Xu Suling, Zhang Binghui, Ma Chonggan, Tang Huimin, Hu Shuyi, Liu Baichuan, Jiang Guangtang, Chen Kecheng, Feng Liutang, Jin Guobao, Jiang Jianbai, Chen Dazai, Zhu Yingpeng, Hu Zhongchi, Huang Tianpeng, He Xiya, Zhou Hanmei, Huang Jingzhai, Chen Binhua, Yao Sufeng, Gu Fengcheng, Ling Xianwen, Gu Jiwu, Xu Zexiang, Wang Xinming, Jin Guangmei, and more than a hundred others.

Chairman's Remarks

Director Pan, the chairman, first gave a speech, stating briefly that the Cultural Construction Association has been established for three years. The original intention of the organization was that, in view of the importance of cultural undertakings, we wanted to contribute a portion of our strength to culture. We do not advocate restoration, nor do we advocate blind obedience, but we want to reconcile and integrate China's inherent culture with Western culture to build a China-based culture. Last year, ten professors issued a declaration on cultural construction, and the Cultural Construction Monthly published by this association discussed it. All parties enthusiastically participated and made great contributions to the trend of Chinese culture. Recently, we have seen that the country's opportunities have improved. In the past year, observations from all aspects can prove the turning point for the country and the nation, especially the peaceful resolution of the Guangdong-Guangxi Incident and the transition from danger to safety in the Xi'an Incident, which further proves that the authority of public opinion cannot be ignored. Recently, several responsible people in the cultural circles discussed that to enhance the authority of public opinion, we must not only rely on the press, but also on people from all walks of life in the entire society to express proper opinions on saving the country. The sum of these opinions can establish the authority of public opinion, which is enough to sanction all words and actions that go against public opinion. China needs unification at this stage. This is an iron fact. Although China has already possessed the prototype of unification, it is not yet solid. Therefore, we must consolidate the foundation of unification. Only the power of the expression of great public opinion can achieve unification without the use of force. Therefore, the Cultural Construction Association recently drafted a Declaration on Unified National Salvation, soliciting signatures from all parties. Those who attended today are all leaders in the cultural circles, and we hope that everyone will jointly discuss, express opinions, and jointly promote it.

Opinions Expressed

(1) Zhang Shouyong's opinion: On the one hand, use public opinion to sanction and attack those who undermine unification; on the other hand, use economic construction as the foundation of unification. (2) Pan Gongbi's opinion: When it is necessary to use force to achieve unification, do not hesitate to use force to achieve unification. (3) Zhang Yi's opinion: We must seek unification under the current government and have a consistent expression to guide all sectors, especially young people, to correct their erroneous thoughts based on the needs of the nation. (4) Li Quanshi's opinion: Vigorously correct the errors of the forces that undermine unification. If they cannot be corrected, then use force to achieve unification. (5) Fu Donghua's opinion: The best way to achieve unification is, of course, to peacefully expand the scope of unification so that those who oppose unification can also be included, and not force them to oppose unification. (6) Yuan Yeyu's opinion: Seek unification by opposing warlords, communists, and traitors. (7) Tong Xingbai's opinion: Establish an absolute theory of unification.

### Telegram from Various Local Organizations Requesting Punishment of the Zhang Yang Rebel Army

According to the Central News Agency, the Joint Association of Citizens of the First and Second Special Districts of this city, various trade associations, various hometown associations, etc., believe that the Central Government is excessively lenient towards the Xi'an Incident, and the rebels such as Zhang and Yang show no remorse, raising troops to rebel against the Party and the country. Therefore, they are sending a special telegram to the Central Government and the National Government, requesting a clear order for a punitive expedition to rectify discipline. They are also sending a telegram to the whole country, unanimously advocating this. The original telegram is recorded below:

Telegram from Citizens of the First and Second Special Districts

"To all newspapers in the country, please forward to all provincial and municipal Party headquarters, governments, schools, and organizations: We have sent a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Military Affairs Commission, stating that the Xi'an Incident has aroused universal indignation. The chief culprits are unpardonable. However, the departments, governments, and commissions, because they escorted Chairman Chiang back to the capital, have shown excessive leniency, giving only light reprimands to the principals and accomplices, which can be described as benevolence and kindness combined. Unexpectedly, the wolf's ambition is difficult to reform and rehabilitate. The rebel Zhang Xueliang dared to secretly send troops to fight, causing the Northeast soldiers to be unable to move forward even if they wanted to obey the Central Government. The rebel Yang Hucheng occupies the Northwest, colluding with bandits and communists, plotting to invade the Central Plains. Their rebellious actions are obvious. If such raising of troops to rebel and betray the Party and the country is not punished, how can discipline be restored and the people of the Northwest be rescued from fire and water? We are sending a special telegram to request that the departments, governments, and commissions issue a clear order for a punitive expedition. As for Zhang Xueliang, the principal culprit of the Xi'an Incident, although he has been pardoned for violating military law, his past crimes of harming the country and the people should be subject to investigation and punishment by a people's court organized by people's organizations to uphold national law and appease public anger. We earnestly request your consideration and implementation, etc. The situation is critical. We respectfully hope for unanimous support to rectify discipline. The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Joint Association and the Second Special District Citizens' Joint Association respectfully kowtow."

Telegram from Over One Hundred Trade Associations

(Omitted above) Upon investigation, the rebel Zhang Xueliang, as a descendant of a warlord, only knew how to seize territory and show off his power, possessing a large army. He had neither national consciousness nor a concept of the country. When the September 18th Incident suddenly occurred, he, as the commander of the Northeast Army, did not know how to defend the territory and protect the country, but instead surrendered the four provinces to the enemy without resistance, disregarding the dignity of the country and trapping the military and civilians in subjugation. The people of the country had long said he deserved to be killed. However, our Central Government forgave his past and allowed him to extricate himself, still allowing him to garrison the important areas of Shaanxi and Gansu, hoping that he would atone for his crimes and observe his future actions. Unexpectedly, the wolf's ambition never subsided. Taking advantage of the time when the pacification of the border was fiercely fought, he again acted recklessly, willingly instigating rebellion, and even dared to kidnap the commander-in-chief, arbitrarily demanding and threatening. If he spoke of resisting the enemy, why didn't he lead the three armies to fight the enemy at the time of the September 18th Incident? If he spoke of saving the country, then not following the established national policy and proceeding in an orderly manner, committing treason and rebellion, is only enough to destroy the country. It can be seen that the so-called resistance to the enemy and saving the country is either deceiving oneself or deceiving others, or even colluding with the Red bandits, not hesitating to recognize the enemy as their father, violating oaths, and destroying discipline. Their crimes are too numerous to count, and they deserve to die. When our Central Government raised troops to launch a punitive expedition, and the large army gathered, Chairman Chiang's benevolence and power spread, and they did not dare to harm him in the slightest. Knowing that resisting in a corner would only lead to death, they shamelessly pleaded guilty, still hoping to survive by luck. Our Central Government again fell for their cunning plan, showing their benevolence, on the one hand, sentencing them to imprisonment to rectify discipline, and on the other hand, granting them special pardons to preserve national strength. People are not made of wood or stone and should know how to be grateful. Zhang Xueliang should have thoroughly reformed and vigorously made amends for his past mistakes. However, the nature of a wolf is ingrained and he will never realize his mistakes until death. As a person who is still at large, he still ordered his subordinates, such as the accomplices Yang Hucheng, to resist the orders and rebel, acting as accomplices, and also colluding with the Red bandits, expanding their army and troops, attempting to claim troops, and their rebellious actions are obvious. Such willing attachment to rebellion, destruction of unity, and endangering of the country and the nation have reached an extreme point. The one who allows the chief culprit to exist is none other than Zhang Xueliang. Even if he dies ten thousand times, it would not be enough to cover his crimes. If the Central Government still insists on leniency, the consequences will be dire. We humbly request that you quickly give a clear and correct punishment to appease the people of the country. As for Yang Hucheng and others, since they dared to resist orders and claim troops, and their rebellious actions are obvious, it is absolutely impossible to indulge them any further. We should request that you issue an order for a punitive expedition to demonstrate the law and discipline and to curb the seeds of chaos. The telegram is urgent, and we cannot bear to wait for orders. Shanghai Flower Shed Industry, Bamboo Industry, Qinglan Cloth Industry, Flannel Industry, Watch Industry, Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry, Bamboo Ware Shop Industry, Fresh Meat Industry, Fresh Pork Selling Industry, Restaurant Industry, Rubber Shop Industry, Charcoal Shop Industry, Green Oil and Flower Shell Industry, Sand and Stone Industry, Coarse Cloth Industry, Glass Industry, one hundred and sixty-four trade associations respectfully kowtow."

Various Hometown Associations' Telegram Requesting the Central Government

(Title omitted) "The Xi'an Incident was initiated by Zhang Xueliang as the chief culprit, and Yang Hucheng and others were also the main instigators, all of whom were undeniably guilty and deserved to die. However, our Central Government, adhering to the principle of leniency in governance, granted Zhang Xueliang a special pardon for his imprisonment, and gave Yang Hucheng and others the punishment of being dismissed but retained in their posts. The original intention was to preserve national strength and promote their self-renewal to become a strong force for resisting foreign aggression in the future, so as to be loyal to the Party and the country. Unexpectedly, in the past ten days, the situation in Xi'an remains tense, and the attitude of Zhang and Yang's troops is ambiguous. Not only do they not comply with the Central Government's orders, but they also expand their army and troops, build fortifications, and collude with the Red bandits, falsely claiming to be the commander-in-chief of the Allied Forces. Such willing betrayal and disregard for the difficulties of the times, if we continue to indulge them, will be like fostering a tumor, and disasters will arise sooner or later. We should request that you quickly impose severe punishments according to the law. Zhang Xueliang is a sinner who lost national territory and the chief instigator of the Shaanxi Incident. He should be publicly executed to appease the people of the country. Yang Hucheng willingly instigated rebellion and colluded with the Red bandits. We also request that you order the three armies to condemn and punish them. Those who regret their mistakes and return should be appeased. Otherwise, those who are stubbornly ignorant should be killed without mercy. Only by pacifying the internal can we resist foreign aggression, and only by unifying can we resist insults. We humbly request that you make a decisive decision and not be lenient again, so as to avoid future troubles. The telegram is filled with grief and indignation. We hope you will take it into consideration. Shaoxing County, Baoshan, Zhenhai, Jiangyin, Hui Ning, Shandong, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Liuhe, Yangzhou, Shangyu, Dongtai, Zhenjiang, etc., sixty-three Shanghai hometown associations respectfully kowtow."

### Silk Factories Running Out of Raw Materials, All Factories Will Suspend Operations

Overseas Silk Market Remains Sluggish, Prospects for the Silk Industry Are Difficult to Be Optimistic

Due to the recent shortage of raw materials, which is insufficient for reeling, more than twenty silk factories in this city have successively suspended operations. Only twenty-six factories are still operating. All the silk factories currently in operation will suspend operations completely within days. At most, it is feared that no more than ten factories will be able to operate in the spring of next year. At present, the overseas silk market remains sluggish, and sales are extremely dull. The highest-grade Shanghai white silk is only selling for more than 700 yuan per picul. Because each factory has run out of raw materials in stock, it would be a loss to purchase raw materials from outside to reel them. Therefore, many are unwilling to operate. The prospects for the silk industry are difficult to be optimistic. The silk factories that are still in operation include Yongxing, Dafeng, Yichang, Yongtailun, Fuchang, Dacheng, Jiyu, Jiuyu, Gongda, Hongchang, Qinyi, Zhicheng, Yufeng, Xinglun, Dongxiang, etc., seventeen in Zhabei and Xinzha districts; Zhongguo, Xingchang, Xiangcheng, Changji, etc., six in Hongkou district; Baotai in the South Shanghai district, Yihua and Tongyu, etc., three in the concession area, totaling twenty-six.

### Cotton Yarn Sales Turn Brisk, Cotton Yarn Stocks Greatly Reduced, Chinese Cotton Mills Open and Rush to Spin

Zhenhua, Xiefeng, etc., Resume Work, All Mills Release Cotton Yarn, All Sold Out

After the cotton yarn industry turned brisk, prices soared and cotton yarn stocks were greatly reduced. Currently, the total amount of cotton yarn stocks in the Shanghai market is less than 10,000 bales (including the cotton yarn stocks in the warehouses of the Chinese Cotton Yarn and Cloth Exchange). The standard price is approximately 250 yuan per bale. Although Chinese and Japanese cotton mills are working day and night to rush to spin, because all mills had previously sold forward cotton yarn, they must deliver the goods on schedule after spinning. Therefore, cotton yarn stocks in the Shanghai market will not increase sharply in the very short term.

National Cotton Mills Open and Rush to Spin

National Chinese cotton mills: ㊀Thirty-one in Shanghai, with 1,118,218 yarn spindles, 99,858 thread spindles, and 8,540 looms; ㊁Twenty-two in Jiangsu Province, with 607,388 yarn spindles, 18,780 thread spindles, and 6,778 looms; ㊂Ten in Hebei Province, with 304,527 yarn spindles, 13,016 thread spindles, and 2,310 looms; ㊃Seven in Hubei Province, with 309,480 yarn spindles, 4,240 thread spindles, and 3,022 looms; ㊄Twenty-five in other provinces, with 52,133 yarn spindles, 21,840 thread spindles, and 4,211 looms. Except for the Minsheng in Hankou and the Yuzhong in Wuhu, which have not yet opened, all the others have fully opened their spindles and are rushing to spin day and night.

Resumption Situation of Various Mills in Shanghai

Previously, due to the sluggish sales of cotton yarn, Chinese cotton mills in Shanghai had successively suspended or reduced work. Now, the mills that had reduced work have long since resumed, and the mills that had suspended work have also opened one after another. For example, the Hengfeng Textile New Bureau has been leased to the China Cotton Industry Company for operation. The Shenxin Second Textile Mill and the Fifth Textile Mill have been maintained by the China and Shanghai Banks. The Zhenhua Lijie Textile Mill has been leased by You Jusheng to Jiaheji and has already opened. The Xiefeng Yiji Textile Mill has been purchased by Datong Cotton Mill and has opened. The Jingwei Mingji Cotton Mill (spinning waste cotton) will open immediately after negotiations for purchase are completed.

### Revolutionary Pioneers Host a Banquet for the Guangxi Inspection Group at Xiang Songpo's

Revolutionary pioneer Xiang Songpo and his comrades, at 6 pm last night, hosted a banquet for the Guangxi Domestic Inspection Group at a Western restaurant at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Henan Road. The group members included Zhang Renmin, Qin Lianfang, Liang Chaoji, Liang Shousheng, Wang Zanbin, Wang Xunzhi, Huang Xuelei, and those invited to accompany them included Central Committee members Mai Huanzhang, Xue Dubi, Chen Lansheng, Yang Ziyuan, Zhai Junqian, Chen Zihe, Liu Suxing, and others, more than a hundred people. During the banquet, Xiang delivered a welcome speech, saying, "Today, Songpo and all comrades are here to welcome the Guangxi Inspection Group. It is a great honor for all the gentlemen. Guilin's landscape is the best in the world, with outstanding people and a thriving culture. Therefore, the politics, culture, military preparations, industry, and construction of Guangxi Province are all praised throughout the country and are worthy of full praise. But they are not satisfied. You have traveled thousands of miles to inspect the situation in various provinces, learning from others' strengths and overcoming your weaknesses. This kind of truly hardworking and tough spirit of leading the people is truly the happiness of Guangxi Province. While we admire you, we feel that the hope for the revival of the entire nation can be seen in this perseverance and spirit. I respectfully offer a toast to wish Guangxi Province and all of you a boundless future," and so on. After Group Leader Zhang delivered a thank you speech, the banquet ended happily at 8:30 pm.

### The Jiaoji Railway Has Reached the Redemption Period

Received Fifteen Years Ago, Deeply Hope to Find a Way to Redeem It

The Jiaoji Railway has reached its redemption period at the end of this year, fifteen years since our country received it. We deeply hope that our country, both the government and the people, will find a way to redeem the railway to preserve the integrity of our rights and interests. According to a reporter from the National Society, the brief history of the railway is as follows: Initially, in the twenty-fourth year of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1898 AD), Germany, under the pretext of the Shandong religious case, not only forcibly leased Jiaozhou Bay, but also forced our country to recognize its right to build roads and mine in Shandong. This was the origin of the Jiaoji Railway, which runs from Qingdao to Jinan, including all branch lines, for a total length of 445 kilometers. In the third year of the Republic of China, the European War broke out. Japan not only violated our neutrality, but also landed from Longkou to attack Qingdao and seized the railway by taking advantage of the opportunity. Although our country was one of the countries participating in the war against Germany, Japan ignored it. At the Paris Peace Conference, because our country refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles, there was the Washington Conference in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, which decided that Japan, in addition to returning Qingdao, would have our country redeem the Jiaoji Railway for a price of 40 million Japanese yen. Because we had no funds to redeem it, we paid with national treasury bonds, with an annual interest rate of 6%, and a term of ten years. Our country agreed to appoint a Japanese as the chief of the traffic department and a Japanese as the chief of the accounting department during that period. Since our country received the railway in January of the twelfth year of the Republic of China, it has been completed by the end of this year, and we can prepare the price for redemption.

### Xiong Xiling and Others Will Leave the Country by Ship Tomorrow

Six Organizations Held a Farewell Ceremony Yesterday

Xiong Xiling and his wife, Chen Heqin, Guan Ruiwu, and other four representatives of our country to the League of Nations Far East Conference on the Prohibition of Trafficking in Women and Children, are scheduled to leave the country on the Chichalua ship on the 19th of this month. The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, the Relief Committee, the Xinwei Relief Association, the Chinese Buddhist Association, the Charity Organizations Federation, and the China Child Welfare Association, and other six organizations, jointly held a tea party at the Youth Association on Baixianqiao Road yesterday afternoon to send them off. The guests and hosts included Xiong Xiling, Wang Yiting, Qu Yingguang, Huang Hanzhi, Chen Tiesheng, Xie Jiaqian, Zhu Ziqiao (representing Zhu Zigan), Liu Wenlin, Monk Changxing, Liu Xiasi, Wang Zhenchang, Qian Jingping, and dozens of others. During the banquet, Chairman Wang Yiting (representing Qu Yingguang) delivered a farewell speech, and Xiong Xiling delivered a reply. The details are recorded as follows:

Chairman's Speech

Wang said, "Mr. Bing and others are going abroad this time to participate in the International Conference on the Prohibition of Trafficking in Women and Children. We would like to offer two points for your consideration: ㊀Promote the awakening of the great powers from the delusion of invading weak countries. Prohibiting the trafficking of women and children is to help the poor and weak. Invading weak nations will only make the prohibition of trafficking in women and children futile. ㊁The number of uneducated and uncared-for women and children in the country is countless. We hope that Mr. Bing and others can urge the government to engage in relief efforts. Relying solely on social organizations is truly overwhelming," and so on.

Xiong Xiling's Speech

Xiong Xiling then delivered a reply, saying, "Our people have always valued the concept of family. Parents and children often prefer to live and die together and are unwilling to sell women and children. However, sometimes, due to floods and droughts, personal finances, smoking, gambling, drugs, abduction, and other reasons, the trafficking of women and children occurs. Our government wants to eliminate the phenomenon of trafficking in women and children, so it is providing relief to the rural economy and organizing water conservancy to avoid floods and droughts, protecting women's rights to achieve economic equality between men and women, so that children are not subject to economic pressure, and actively prohibiting smoking and gambling to prevent people from being harmed. However, to eliminate the crime of abduction, it is related to the right to jurisdiction. The crimes of abduction and seduction often occur within the concessions. Therefore, abolishing the right to jurisdiction is also a key strategy to eliminate the phenomenon of trafficking in women and children," and so on. The meeting then adjourned. According to Xiong's words to a reporter from the National Society, the formal representative of our country to the conference is Song Faxiang, our consul-general in Batavia, Java. Xiong and others only have the right to attend and speak, but have no right to vote. The participants include about ten countries, including China, Japan, the Philippines, and Portugal. The United States will attend as an observer. Trafficking in women and children is prevalent in Java, so the meeting was chosen to be held there for convenient inspection. The meeting will last about a week. Xiong and others are scheduled to leave the country on the afternoon of the 19th and return to the country around the 20th of next month. There are currently no proposals. If there is a need or a temporary proposal is put forward at that time, the prohibition of trafficking in women and children should also prohibit prostitution at the same time. In short, if there is a solution to the social economy and individuals are not subject to the pressure of life, then the problem of prostitution will also be easily resolved," and so on.

### Guangxi Inspection Group Scheduled to Leave Shanghai for Hangzhou Tomorrow

Various Parties Host a Banquet Last Night, Continue to Visit Today

Since arriving in Shanghai on the 11th, the Guangxi Inspection Group has visited factories and cultural institutions for days and attended banquets from all walks of life, which has been extremely busy. Feng Shaoshan, general manager of the Shanghai Kailin Paint Factory, and Chen Guangfu, chairman of the Banking Association, Lin Kanghou, chairman of the National Chamber of Commerce Federation, and Wu Zhongxin, chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, held grand receptions for the group yesterday afternoon and will leave Shanghai for Hangzhou tomorrow to go to Beijing along the Beijing-Hangzhou National Road. The details are recorded as follows:

Ma's Tea Party

Feng Shaoshan, manager of the Kailin Paint Factory, held a grand tea party at the Guangdong Bank Club yesterday afternoon to receive the entire group of members. The guests included Zhang Renmin, Xiong Xiling, Chu Huiseng, Mai Huanzhang, Feng Ziyou, and more than 200 others. Feng delivered a welcome speech, saying, "Although I am from Guangdong, I have lived in Shanghai for many years and can be considered a half-local. I am very honored to hold a tea party today and have the honor of the visit of the members of the inspection group and representatives from all walks of life. The construction of Guangxi has progressed greatly this year, which is well known. A delegation has now been organized to visit various parts of the country to develop the foundation of industry and economy. The future will be limitless. Please forgive me for the simple reception today." Then, Group Leader Zhang Renmin delivered a speech of thanks, saying, "I am very grateful for the warm reception from all walks of life during this visit to Shanghai. Shanghai is the economic and cultural center of the country. I have visited various places for days and am filled with excitement to see the progress of industry and commerce. Guangxi is a poor and impoverished place. Since the 20th year of the Republic of China, the authorities and people of society have been working hard. The people have had considerable training and organization. We often feel that to defend against foreign aggression and save the country, we cannot only rely on the army. The people must have a strong organization. Guangxi's industry is underdeveloped, and imports far exceed exports. The mission of our group is to study the industry for reference." Jin Runxiang, Gu Xinyi, Feng Ziyou, Mai Huanzhang, Wu Yunzhai, Chu Huiseng, and others also spoke successively. The speeches were omitted.

Chen et al.'s Banquet

Chen Guangfu, chairman of the Banking Association, Lin Kanghou, chairman of the National Chamber of Commerce Federation, and Wu Zhongxin, chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, jointly hosted a banquet for the group at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 7 pm yesterday. The entire group of members and the president of the Supreme Court, Jiao Yitang, and invited Mai Huanzhang, Gan Jiehou, Rong Zongjing, Qian Xinzhi, Guo Bingwen, Du Yuesheng, Huang Renzhi, Pan Yangyao, and others to accompany them. Chen Guangfu and Lin Kanghou, etc., delivered welcome speeches, expressing their admiration for Guangxi's hard work and rapid progress in construction in recent years, and hoping to learn more about Shanghai's industry and commerce. Then, Group Leader Zhang delivered a thank-you speech, in addition to expressing his gratitude, he also hoped that all walks of life in Shanghai would assist in the development of industry in Guangxi, especially welcome investment. During the banquet, they exchanged opinions with each other, which was extremely pleasant.

Today's Visits

The group's schedule for continued visits and receptions from all walks of life today is as follows: (A) Visit the Jiangnan Paper Mill, the Academia Sinica, and the Zhonghua Book Company in the morning; the Jiangnan Shipyard and the Naval Machinery Factory in the afternoon; (B) At noon today, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Chu Huiseng, Yan Nanzhang, Zhou Zuomin, He Qianli, He Yunzhai will host a banquet at the International Hotel.

### Grand Banquet Held by the Red Swastika Society's Head and Branch Offices the Day Before Yesterday

A Farewell Banquet for President Xiong Xiling to Attend the Conference in Java

On the afternoon of the 16th of this month at 4 PM, the head and branch offices of the World Red Swastika Society of China held a farewell banquet on the upper floor of the Central Hotel on Sima Road in Shanghai for President Xiong Xiling and his wife, President Mao Ciguang, to attend the Far East Conference in Java on the Prohibition of Trafficking in Women and Children. Representatives from various branches, as well as male and female members, numbering over 200, were present. In the hall hung a portrait of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, flanked by crossed national flags and Red Swastika flags. The agenda was as follows: ① Opening of the farewell banquet, ② All stand at attention, ③ Bow three times to the portrait of the late Premier, ④ Bow once to the national flag and Swastika emblem, ⑤ Read the late Premier's will, ⑥ Silent tribute for three minutes, ⑦ Chairman's opening remarks, ⑧ Speeches by guests, ⑨ Response by President Xiong and Madam Xiong, ⑩ Photograph and adjournment. The record of the speeches is presented below:

Chairman Zhang Qianmiao, in his speech, briefly stated: "Today, our society bids farewell to President Xiong and Madam Xiong as they attend the Far East Conference in Java. Under the guidance of President Xiong, our various branches have been in existence for over ten years. This attendance at an international organization is unprecedented. The future flourishing of our Swastika emblem will be based on this. However, our President Xiong, at such an advanced age and during this cold season, does not shrink from the hardship of traveling across the ocean, which further demonstrates our society's great spirit of fearlessly rescuing humanity. This truly deserves our farewell."

Chairman Han Shichang, representing the Shanghai branch, briefly stated: "Regarding this Java conference, when our society held a general assembly in Jinan, I was also nominated to attend. However, I refrained from accepting, firstly due to too many personal affairs, and secondly because an international conference requires someone who bears the weight of global expectations to attend, in order to demonstrate our country's solemnity. For these two reasons, I dared not take on the responsibility. Today, I am very pleased to see President Xiong leaving the country, as President Xiong is the sole leader of our society and also a first-class celebrity and Premier of our country. His great reputation has long spread throughout the world. His importance in attending this international conference goes without saying. Furthermore, he will certainly do his best to report on our society's work over the years, so that the international community will know that our Red Swastika Society is a purely charitable organization that seeks happiness for the people of the world." Chairman Li Tianzhen of the Tianjin branch, briefly stated: "Today, as we bid farewell to President Xiong, I have two words to express. The purpose of our society is entirely based on the two words 'rescue' and 'deliverance.' The so-called 'rescue' refers to our efforts to save people who have already suffered from disasters such as war, fire, and floods. This is tangible. The so-called 'deliverance' refers to our use of utmost sincerity and願力 (spiritual power) to turn big disasters into small ones and small ones into nothing when disaster is brewing. This is intangible. This time, President Xiong's trip abroad is to attend the conference on the prohibition of trafficking in women and children, which is entirely intangible 'deliverance.' Moreover, President Xiong's other name is Miaotong, which means 'wonderful communication,' and he possesses a wonderful運 (fortune) and auspicious aura, enabling it to reach everywhere, thereby expressing the meaning of our society's Swastika. And President Mao's name, Ciguang, has a heart of慈仁 (compassion) and expands the meaning of 光大 (glorious development)."

President Xiong Xiling responded, briefly stating: "This year's Java conference in March is the second one. When the first conference was held, it was entirely attended by representatives from various governments, and there were no social organizations involved. This time, after discussions among various countries, it was decided that our society would have the power to develop only if charitable organizations from various countries joined. At that time, I was publicly recommended by the Jinan General Assembly to go, along with my wife. However, due to my wife's illness, I dared not accept. The people who were subsequently recommended were all unable to go abroad due to various reasons, and no one went. I felt that although our society has been in operation for over ten years, the international community may not yet fully understand it. This time, only three organizations from China will be attending the Java conference: ① the China Children's Welfare Association, ② the World Red Swastika Society, and ③ the Xiangshan Children's Welfare Institute. Among these three organizations, our society has a larger scale, and in the past ten years or so, we have done a great deal of work, especially in rescuing over 260,000 homeless and impoverished people. However, what is lacking is that we have not had statistics for many years, and we have not promoted our work as much as possible, so very few people in the world know about it. This time, in attending the Java conference, firstly, I will take this opportunity to promote the spirit of cooperation between Chinese charitable organizations and the government; secondly, I can promote our hard work and achievements over the past ten years to the international community; and thirdly, I can make Chinese women and children understand the significance of this participation, to preserve our country's good old customs of parents loving their children, unlike the slave trade in Africa, which violates humanism and is not rescued and maintained. For these three reasons, I am determined to go with my wife. Moreover, the reason for the trafficking in women and children is that our country has not seen much of it in the past. Since various countries have transported white flour, red pills, and morphine to our country for sale, those in our country who are unaware of this only know to try it occasionally at the time, and then become addicted to it and are beyond redemption, and even go bankrupt and lose their children due to addiction. This time, when I go abroad, I will definitely seek international help so that all kinds of drugs from various countries will not be imported into China. If this is effective, then the women and children of our country will be guaranteed that they will never be trafficked forever."

President Mao Ciguang responded, briefly stating: "Today, the presidents of various branches and female presidents of our society have gathered here to bid farewell to Mr. Xiong and myself. I have two regrets today. Firstly, the predecessors of our society have been waiting here for a long time, and I arrived the latest, which is quite regrettable. However, the reason is that our own car broke down halfway, and we had to call another car before we could come. Secondly, I have been a member of the society for the shortest amount of time, and the predecessors have been running it for over ten years, so their experience is naturally vast. I hope that when I go abroad this time, the predecessors will give me a lot of information about the history of our society so that I can present it at the international conference in the future. Not only will the Eastern countries know that our society is the largest charitable organization in China, but also the Western countries will know that our society's work over the years is entirely based on the principle of mutual love for humanity, turning death into life, and seeking permanent peace for the world, and not only promoting the Swastika emblem in China. I was originally unable to go due to illness, but then my health improved slightly, and Mr. Xiong repeatedly asked if I could go to Java or not. I thought that this Java conference was entirely for the rescue of women and children. If there were no women from China participating, it would have a fundamental impact. Therefore, no matter how difficult it is, I will accompany Mr. Xiong on this trip. However, I am truly unworthy of such a grand farewell. I sincerely thank all the predecessors and fellow practitioners of our society for their kindness."

After the speeches were over, Yiru Photography Studio used electric light to take a group photo of the farewell, and then the meeting adjourned.

### Fish Merchants Request Exemption from Ticket Fee; Du Yuesheng Agrees to Stop It

The Yongfeng and Yongding fish merchant associations previously stated that the brokers in the fish market were overcharging one point for ticket fees, which was an unbearable additional burden. They repeatedly sent joint letters requesting sympathy and cancellation in accordance with the law. Later, they received a notice from the fish market agreeing to comply. After receiving the notice, the brokers claimed that the one point ticket fee was originally deducted voluntarily by the fish merchants, which aroused public outrage among the fish merchants. On the 11th of this month, more than 20 people, including Xin Liyue, jointly went to the Dinghai Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai to request that justice be upheld. President Liu Hongsheng, considering Dinghai as a hometown known for fishing, deeply cared about the suffering of the fishermen from his county and immediately sent the head of association affairs, Hu Shenzhai, to meet with them on his behalf, promising to provide assistance. Subsequently, they petitioned the chairman of the fish market council, Du Yuesheng, and supervisor Qian Xinzhi, who both personally received them. After inquiring, they instructed the fish merchants to directly demand the return of the overcharged fees from the brokers. If anyone refused to comply, they could report it again, and there would be a solution. The fish merchants were satisfied and returned. However, the brokers still superficially complied but secretly disobeyed and continued to forcibly deduct fees. Therefore, yesterday, they petitioned Chairman Du for the second time. Secretary Li received them and promised to take effective measures immediately and wait for a reply today. According to a fish merchant, the fish market had already notified the cancellation of the ticket fee, and Chairman Du had also agreed to directly demand the return from the brokers. The brokers should obey the orders of the fish market council and should not allow the brokers to resist to the end. It was also said that there are now more than 200 fishing boats selling iced fish in the fish market. Each time, one percent is deducted based on the value, with each boat paying 300 to 500 yuan for those with higher values and 200 to 300 yuan for those with lower values, totaling no less than 70,000 to 80,000 yuan each year. Regardless of the fish merchants' profits and losses, they must bear this additional burden, so it is natural to fight to the end in accordance with the law.

### The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Advocates for Income Tax

The Chamber's Staff Have Already Withheld and Paid Taxes According to Regulations; Representatives Attending the Research Conference Are Enthusiastic

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that income tax is a good tax that is common in various countries, and all citizens have an obligation to pay it. Currently, the country is implementing the collection of this tax, whether it is from business income or salary income, starting from January of this year. The Chamber's staff and commercial night school teachers, who are required to pay taxes according to regulations, totaling 50 people, ranging from the lowest amount of 5 cents to the highest amount of 1 yuan and 6 jiao, have all had the amount deducted from their salaries by the finance department and then paid to the Central Bank, and reported to the Income Tax Office at the same time. The Chamber has convened representatives from nearby chambers of commerce and various trade associations in the city to hold a research conference on practical issues related to income tax from the 20th to the 25th of this month, from 2 PM to 5 PM every day, hosted by accountant Xu Yongzuo and Chamber secretary Yan Esheng. Currently, those who have registered include the Hangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce and representatives from the money industry, banking industry, fresh pork industry, pawnshop industry, cotton cloth industry, foreign goods tea industry, cosmetics industry, timber industry, thermos bottle manufacturing industry, coal industry, fresh pork slaughtering industry, fresh pork selling industry, domestic paint and sundry goods industry, cotton transportation industry, rayon industry, firecracker flower processing industry, eyeglasses industry, silk edging industry, construction factory industry, electrical appliance manufacturing industry, wheat bran industry, clock and watch industry, woodworking industry, tobacco exchange industry, iron industry, cattle and sheep raw hide industry, foreign goods straw hat industry, and firewood and charcoal industry. All the various regulations, detailed rules, collection guidelines, and forms to be filled out related to income tax have also been published in the January issue of the Commercial Monthly Report, which is expected to be published by the end of this month.

### A Customer Commits Suicide by Jumping from a Game Arcade

The Circumstances Are Tragic

Zhang Bingfa, 23 years old, from Changzhou, an employee of a certain bookstore, committed suicide by jumping from the sixth floor of a certain game arcade at around 9 PM last night. He fell onto the sidewalk on Guizhou Road, and his brains burst open instantly, a tragic sight to behold. Later, a Chinese constable No. 177 spotted him and took him to Renji Hospital by car. He died of his injuries before reaching the hospital. The body was sent to the coroner's office to await examination. It is said that the man lost a leather suitcase in the arcade and committed suicide after searching for it in vain.

### Fire in Shiqingfang, Zhabei

At around 11 PM last night, a fire broke out in the home of Yang Adi at No. 2 Shiqingfang, Xingjia Muqiao Road, Zhabei, due to carelessness with fire. Thick smoke and flames immediately filled the air. As a result, one room on the upper floor was burned down. Fire brigades from various sections of Zhabei rushed to the scene with fire engines to extinguish the fire. The arsonist, Yang Adi, was arrested by the patrolling police and taken to the Beisichuan Road Police Station for interrogation.

### The Association for Participation in the Paris Exposition Held a Meeting for Exhibitors Yesterday

However, since the time is approaching, our country's exhibits must be completely shipped out from March 1st to mid-March. In this short period of time, I hope that everyone will work hard to promote the glory of our country's unique exhibits. In the future, after the exposition is over, ① the exhibits will be sold, and the value will be returned to the exhibitors after the meeting; ② those that are not sold will be returned to the exhibitors; ③ the exhibitors will also be given certificates of award. Paris has a large population, and people from all over the world can gather there, which is a good opportunity to promote our country's culture and develop our country's goods."

Lin Kuixian, Xue Xiliang, and Zhang Shenshi were released.

### Informant on Drug Trafficking

Found Outside the House; Informant Detained

Ding Boqi, the town head and chairman of the chamber of commerce of Caoxing Town in Shanghai County, is the only notable person there. Suddenly, Qu Guantao, a bamboo pole carrier, went to the Third District Administrative Inspectorate of Songjiang to report that Boqi was selling drugs. The office immediately sent military police, along with Qu Guantao, to search Ding's house in Caoxing, but found nothing. Later, Qu pointed to ten small packets of morphine found beside the bamboo fence outside the small house behind the house. Because the stolen goods were not found inside the house, but in the open space outside the house, it was very suspicious. When asked how Qu Guantao knew about it, he said that he heard people in the teahouse say that Ding Boqi specialized in selling drugs. Fearing that he might be framed for throwing the stolen goods, Qu Guantao and Ding Boqi were both taken to the office and sent to the detention center to await investigation.

### Strict Winter Defense in the County's Agricultural Warehouse

Fire Hazards and Bandits Should Be Paid Attention To

The Shanghai County Government, considering that agricultural warehouses are important places for saving the rural economy and finance, and that local military police should usually provide strict protection to prevent accidents, especially during the winter defense period, should pay closer attention to fire hazards and bandits, and take strict precautions to ensure caution. It has specially instructed the military police under its jurisdiction to strictly protect the warehouses and not to be negligent in the slightest.

### John's Student Accused of Detention for a Leather Belt

Huo Zhenghong Feels Unjustly Implicated; Shi Bogen Claims to Be Dutch and Awaits Summons

Shi Bogen, a 22-year-old Javanese student at St. John's University on Jessfield Road, Shanghai, was recently sued in the First Special Court by Cantonese Huo Zhenghong, residing at No. 878 Beisichuan Road, with lawyer Yan Xishi as his attorney, on charges of defamation, etc. The case was heard in the Fifth Criminal Division yesterday afternoon by Judge Dai Rongduo. The defendant, Shi Bogen, did not appear. The lawyer Yan appeared in court to defend him. According to the plaintiff, Huo Zhenghong, "I have been a coach in the Guangdong swimming team in Shanghai. The defendant is a backbone member of the Zhongqing swimming team (i.e., the Chinese YMCA swimming team). Usually, since we are both swimming comrades, our relationship is good. However, jealousy also arises due to swimming competitions. On July 14th of last year, the defendant learned that the Guangdong team I led would compete with the West YMCA swimming team the next day. The defendant was deeply afraid that the championship would be won by our team, and jealousy arose. He intended to slander me. Therefore, at 1:00 AM on the 14th, the defendant asked me to exchange the size of a leather belt of unknown origin at the Rongzhang Company on Nanjing Road on behalf of me at the YMCA on Sichuan Road. I was unaware of his scheme and did so. Unexpectedly, when I handed over the belt, I was detained by a Westerner at Rongzhang Company, who said that the belt had been stolen in the morning by a man in Western clothes and was actually stolen goods. I was horrified and argued with them to no avail. I was finally arrested and taken to the general police station and detained. It was not until 7:00 PM that I was released after it was clarified that I was not involved. When I returned to the team, the whole team knew about it and made fun of me. My boss, Le Zuyi of Dacheng Gold Shop, also dismissed me because I was suspected of theft. Later, I negotiated with the defendant, and the defendant also admitted this and was willing to compensate for the loss of 600 yuan. However, I have not received a single penny to date. Therefore, I am suing. In addition to requesting punishment according to Article 313 of the Criminal Law, I am also attaching a civil suit for 600 yuan. Furthermore, the defendant is studying at St. John's University and will graduate on the 20th of this month and return to Java soon. Please order him to appear in court." Then, the defendant's lawyer rose to raise the issue of jurisdiction, saying that the defendant's original nationality was Dutch Javanese, and the Dutch Consulate had already sent an official document to the President of the Court, so the Court had no right to hear the case. Judge Dai said that since the issue of nationality had arisen, the case should be rescheduled for the 23rd of this month in the afternoon for the defendant to appear in court for further questioning.

### Da Feng Biscuit Factory Owner Accused of Abduction and Rape

The Defendant Consistently Claims Illness and Fails to Appear; The Court Will Send a Forensic Doctor for Examination

Zhang Baoyuan, a 55-year-old from Qingjiang, residing at No. 53 Fuzifang, Rue Massenet, has only one daughter, named Xiubao, who is 19 years old this year. When she was 12 years old, she entered the Da Feng Biscuit Factory at No. 13 Rue Lafayette to work. When she was 15 years old, she was seduced by the factory owner, Yang Guihe (i.e., Qihua of Guihua), into adultery. They used inns as places for secret rendezvous, causing the girl to conceive secretly. Her abdomen gradually grew, and Zhang discovered it. He asked his daughter about the situation and negotiated with Yang. Yang agreed to take

Xiubao as a concubine and promised to schedule a meeting with a lawyer to sign a contract. However, he only agreed verbally and did not fulfill his promise. Until recently, when the woman was pregnant for the full term, Yang ordered his wife to accompany Xiubao to the hospital to give birth. At the same time, Yang invited the woman's father to a lawyer's office to sign a contract and paid 300 yuan to cover all expenses during the delivery period. Later, after the woman gave birth

### Railway Department Rectifies Staff Ticketing Procedures

Strictly Regulating Scope of Use; Penalties for Unauthorized Use Include Suspension

The Ministry of Railways' previous regulations and procedures for preferential ticketing for staff and their families were insufficiently strict. Therefore, from January 1st of this year, they have been revised. The details are as follows:

Scope of Use

According to the new regulations, each staff member and their family, if they need to apply for preferential travel tickets, may not exceed sixteen tickets per year. All previous half-price and quarter-price preferential measures are abolished to standardize the process. The scope of use is limited to grandfathers, grandmothers, fathers, mothers, spouses, children, and unmarried younger siblings under the age of 20. Survey forms for all ministry staff and their families have been printed. Staff are required to truthfully fill them out in advance. Each application is limited to those already listed on the survey form.

Strict Prohibition of Unauthorized Use

Preferential travel tickets must include the name, title, gender, age, place of origin, badge, and serial number. If used by a family member, the relationship to the staff member must also be noted for verification. Tickets are invalid if the staff member is not wearing their badge. Any unauthorized transfer or use will result in the unauthorized user being fined five times the fare. The transferring staff member will have one month's salary deducted for the first offense and will be suspended for the second offense. To prevent unauthorized transfer and use, all railway bureaus have been instructed to thoroughly investigate the use of these preferential tickets to prevent abuses.

### Tongyi Creditor Meeting Adjourned Again Yesterday Due to Lack of Quorum

Since Tongyi Trust Company declared bankruptcy on June 15th of last year, the First Special District Court has held hearings and appointed accountant Li Ding and lawyer Li Mian to handle the liquidation. The accountant has convened three meetings of creditors, but each time, the number of creditors present was insufficient to reach a quorum, resulting in adjournment. Yesterday at 1:00 PM, the First Special District Court convened the fourth meeting of creditors of the savings department at Lake Society. Over 300 creditors were present. Jiang Gongliang, a judge from the civil division of the First Special District Court, and liquidator Li Ding served as chairpersons. Judge Jiang and Accountant Li announced that the total amount of debt represented by the creditors present was over 570,000 yuan, which was still insufficient for a quorum. Creditors expressed their opinions, with many stating that the end of the year was approaching and they hoped for a solution as soon as possible. However, since the total amount of debt represented was still below the required quorum, any resolutions would be legally invalid. Therefore, they requested an early adjournment. Judge Jiang announced that he would report the situation to the court and schedule another meeting. He then adjourned the meeting.

### Bumper Harvests in Various Places, But Abnormal Situation in Shanghai; More Poor People Than Before

Soup Kitchens and Mat Sheds Insufficient; 32 More Rooms to be Added, Accommodating 10,000 People

The soup kitchen established by the Zhabei Charity Association on Liuying Road opened on the 15th. Because the number of people seeking food has been increasing daily, the original 42 mat sheds can only accommodate a maximum of 12,000 people, which is insufficient. Therefore, starting yesterday, 32 more reed mat sheds are being added in the surrounding open space. It is estimated that they will be completed in about 20 days, after which they can accommodate 22,000 people. Yesterday, over 12,000 people sought food. Adults received three scoops of porridge each, and children received two scoops each. According to Wang Binyan, the director of the association, told a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, although various places have reported bumper harvests this year, Shanghai is experiencing an economic downturn, with factories closing down one after another. Therefore, the number of poor people has increased compared to previous years. Since the opening of the soup kitchen, poor people from distant places like Longhua and Yinxiang Township have been coming here with their families. Although the amount given is not much, because it is thick and dry, they can take it back, add water, and cook it again to make a day's worth of food. In the past three days, an average of 30 dan of rice has been cooked per day, with each dan able to feed 300 people. However, donations from various parties have been very small, only over 200 dan of rice and over 5,000 yuan in national currency. Therefore, the future is very difficult. The opening period is set for one month. If there are any surplus funds, the distribution will be extended. As for spring relief, it will depend on the donation situation. If there is a surplus after the winter relief, rice tickets will be distributed at the end of the lunar year and the beginning of the new year.

### County Government Planning to Establish Songjiang-Shanghai Telephone Line

The Songjiang District telephone network in this province is being planned by various counties under the instruction of the Third District Administrative Commissioner's Office.

After receiving the order, the Shanghai County Government has already instructed Qi Kezhong, the head of construction, to determine the routes and installation locations this month. The Construction Department will then invite bids for construction and is expected to complete construction, acceptance, and start telecommunications by June of this year.

### Member of British Animal Protection Society, Ms. Naska, Arrives in Shanghai

Traveling the World to Investigate Nursing Conditions; Feels Deeply that Various Places Lack Animal Protection Laws

Ms. Naska, a member of the British Royal Society for the Protection of Animals, is currently on a world tour. She departed from London and traveled through Canada, Tokyo, Osaka, Beijing, Hankou, and the capital before arriving in Shanghai the other day. She will stay in Shanghai for a few days and then take a ship to Hong Kong, before returning to England via India and Egypt. Ms. Naska told a reporter yesterday that the British Royal Society for the Protection of Animals established an overseas affairs committee two years ago to assist similar associations abroad. Her visit is to fulfill this mission. According to her observations in various places, there are two main points: (1) a lack of comprehensive animal protection laws, and (2) a lack of funding and equipment for animal care, such as opening free veterinary hospitals. Ms. Naska also said that she saw many cattle and horses in Beijing being subjected to cruel treatment, which she believed was due to the lack of animal protection laws. Ms. Naska concluded by saying that she strongly agreed with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's New Life Movement, as this movement could improve the lives of the people and guide people to love and care for livestock.

### Large Group of Haimen Gang Robbers Intercepted in Western Shanghai

Dozens of Cases Already Committed in Xujiahui; Robbers to be Handed Over to Headquarters for Interrogation

Zhang Zhongde, the captain of the fourth detachment of the Municipal Police Department's Criminal Investigation Team, received a confidential tip the other day that a large group of Haimen Gang robbers planned to rob the home of a wealthy gentleman in the area north of Sanguantang Bridge, Jisi Fei Road, in Western Shanghai on the evening before last. Upon receiving the report, Captain Zhang immediately dispatched patrol leader Tang Bingxiang, investigators Zhao Quanhui, Li Pinquan, Han Yushan, Xu Dekui, and others in disguise to lie in ambush in the surrounding area. At around 9:00 PM, several robbers were seen swaggering forward, and just as they were about to act, patrol leader Tang led the investigators to bravely step forward and arrest Haimen natives Gao Jinbao (31 years old), Lin Minggao (29 years old), and Wu Asan (25 years old). A Browning pistol without a serial number and six bullets were found on Gao. They were immediately taken back for interrogation. Gao confessed to plotting to rob the wealthy gentleman and revealed the location of his accomplices. After receiving the confession, Captain Zhang dispatched the original team of investigators, accompanied by Gao, and requested assistance from detectives from the Huishi Police Station. In rooms 60 and 63 of the Jiangsu Hotel at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and the concession boundary, ten more robbers were arrested: Haimen natives Gu Longren (30 years old), Gu Wangshi (27 years old), Shi Shaoqing (23 years old), Wang Asan (30 years old), Huang Deying (26 years old), Zhao Yonghu (25 years old), Zhao Tiancai (31 years old), Dai Fugen (25 years old), Mao Afu (26 years old), and Huang Abing (29 years old). They were all taken back to the detachment and then transferred to the Caojiadu Police Station. After interrogation by Officer Xing, due to the case involving armed robbery and the fact that the large group of robbers had committed dozens of robberies in Xujiahui and other places, making them extremely dangerous, a document was prepared to hand them over to the headquarters for strict handling.

### Japanese Student Travels to Shanghai Under an Assumed Name

Remained Silent and Fasted for Over 60 Hours; Previously Visited Fujian, Guangdong, Hubei and Other Places

Yamada Yuzo, a student of political economy at Waseda University in Japan, came to China to study the situation after graduating this spring. He departed from Japan on December 23rd of last year and first visited Taiwan to conduct on-site inspections. He then went to Xiamen, Fuzhou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou, and planned to come to Shanghai via the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. However, local officials, fearing accidents along the way, did not allow it. He then traveled in cognito as a Chinese person, bought a third-class ticket, boarded the train, did not say a word, did not eat anything, and never talked to other passengers. He traveled to Xujiapeng in Wuchang, a total of 60 hours, without eating or speaking. He then took a train from Hankou through Zhengzhou and Xuzhou to Beijing, and then came to Shanghai from Beijing the other day (the 16th). According to him, this had been his long-cherished wish for many years.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Decides to Reduce Staff Salaries

The Authorities' Reply is Firm; Staff Will Not Resign

The Dalu News reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council formulated a austerity plan last year, reducing the salaries of all staff by 8% and cutting certain subsidies. When the staff were notified, it was stated that objections could be submitted in writing. Subsequently, staff from the police department and public works department almost unanimously opposed the reduction of retirement pensions and submitted a written opinion to the Municipal Council through their directors, requesting amendments. The staff recently received a reply from the Secretary General of the Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, which stated that the request to amend the retirement pension regulations had been reviewed. However, the Municipal Council was forced to take this measure due to environmental pressures. Therefore, the staff were asked to reconsider, withdraw their formal protest, and continue to serve under the new regulations. Those who were unwilling would be given short notice and the opportunity to resign. The tone of the letter was firm, and it seemed that there was no room for negotiation. It is not yet known what the staff's reaction will be after receiving this. However, a staff member told a reporter from the Dalu News yesterday that the issue of resignation would not arise, as the Municipal Council had initially requested the staff to raise objections.

### Gasoline Price Increase

The Shanghai Times reports that since last Wednesday, the price of gasoline in the city has increased by five cents per gallon. This is due to the global increase in the cost of crude oil. According to a Mobil Oil Company official yesterday, the American shipping strike has nothing to do with this. American oil tankers are still sailing as usual, and most of the gasoline is shipped to Shanghai from Borneo and the Dutch East Indies. In recent years, the lowest price of gasoline was only 55 cents per gallon. At that time, a Mr. Hornesberg brought in a type of "apple green oil" to compete with the San Huo Oil Company, but this oil soon disappeared from the market, and the price of oil rose again. Later, Soviet oil was shipped to Shanghai, and the price of oil fell again to 70 cents per gallon. The most expensive time for oil was in 1931, when it cost from 1.10 yuan to 1.25 yuan per gallon. Therefore, the current price of 1.05 yuan per gallon is not yet the highest peak in recent years.

### National Physician Cai Xiangsun Returns to Shanghai by Plane from Guangdong

National physician Cai Xiangsun flew to Guangdong at the invitation of Song Ziliang, Director of the Guangdong Department of Finance, to provide medical treatment. Mr. Song was suffering from severe damp fever, and after Cai's careful diagnosis and treatment, his fever had subsided. However, he urgently needed to move to another location for recuperation. Therefore, he took Yu Hanmou's plane to Shanghai on the 15th. Dr. Cai also returned to Shanghai on the same plane and has already resumed his practice at the medical clinic at Lao Zha Bridge.

### Zhabei Charity Association to Hold Third Matching of Women from the Shelter

Five Women Have Reached Marriageable Age This Year; Those with Jobs and Guarantors Can Apply to be Matched

The Zhabei Charity Association has a total of 150 women in its shelter, and there is a serious overcrowding problem. Two years ago, the association matched 12 women who had reached marriageable age, and last year it also matched seven women. Currently, there are still five women who have reached marriageable age. Therefore, the association has decided to hold a third matching event as usual. All procedures are the same as in previous years. Anyone with a proper job and a reliable guarantor can apply to be matched. After both parties are satisfied with the discussions, a wedding ceremony will be held. As for the children in the shelter, there are also 150 of them. Those who have reached the age of apprenticeship are introduced to jobs according to their interests. Seven people have already been introduced to jobs, and efforts are being made to introduce the rest so that they can all have proper jobs.

### Paramount President's 25th Anniversary

The Grand Cathay to Screen Commemorative Film

The 22nd of this month marks the 25th anniversary of Mr. Zukor's service to Paramount Pictures. On this day, the Grand Cathay Theatre will screen Zukor's latest masterpiece, "The Great Ziegfeld," starring Glenda Farrell, Frank McHugh, Jack Oakie, and others, which can be compared to "The Merry Widow". In Hollywood, everyone knows that Zukor is a great man who has contributed to the film industry. His achievements in the world's film industry are significant. If, on this commemorative occasion, we talk about Zukor's early days in the film industry, it would be very meaningful. When Zukor first entered the film industry, stage plays were popular, and all films were short films of one or two reels. There were no feature films. In 1912, he founded the Famous Players Film Company, but it did not attract much attention. However, he did not lose heart and instead took a firm stand, advocating that famous stars should appear in famous films. It is said that Zukor has a characteristic: he likes to listen to other people's criticisms. Therefore, after the film has finished screening, he often mingles with the audience to listen to their criticisms of the film. In order to cater to the social mentality and change their tastes, he bought the exclusive rights to screen "Queen Elizabeth" by the French firm Bien et Haas in the United States for 35,000 US dollars. On July 12, 1912, it was screened at the Lyceum Theatre in New York. As expected, the general audience was very appreciative, creating a new record for feature films in the United States. At the same time, he proved to the Broadway stage stars that making films would not harm their value. One by one, they signed contracts with him. The first films to be produced included "The Count of Monte Cristo," starring James O'Neill, and "The Prisoner of Zenda," starring James K. Hackett. Hackett was the father of the famous screenwriter Walter Hackett. John Barrymore was the first stage star to join Zukor's Famous Players Film Company. Mary Pickford also joined, at that time she was only nineteen years old. With golden curly hair, she was the standard American girl. Zukor signed a contract with her for a salary of 20,000 US dollars per year, which was an astounding amount at that time. But in less than four years, Mary Pickford's salary had increased to 10,000 US dollars per week. At that time, Zukor's business was only in the eastern United States. Because of his success, several people in Hollywood similarly founded film companies, such as Cecil B. DeMille, Lasky, and Goldwyn. Their first films were screened in New York in 1914. Zukor congratulated them on their productions, and they became acquainted and cooperated. This was the starting point of Paramount Pictures. The recently produced "The Great Ziegfeld" is Paramount's latest masterpiece. Glenda Farrell and Frank McHugh are both stars recently discovered by Zukor. There are many stars in Hollywood who have been successfully promoted by him, such as Pola Negri, Gloria Swanson, Adolphe Menjou, Bebe Daniels, and Will Rogers.

### A Review of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Committee's Work Over the Past Three Years

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Affairs Committee was abolished at the end of last year. The chairman of the committee, Mr. Massey, has prepared a report on the achievements of the committee since its establishment. The main points are translated below: ① Reducing the number of rickshaws: The Board of Directors of the Municipal Council has approved the gradual reduction of the number of vehicles as proposed by the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, and decided to reduce 484 vehicles from March 1 this year. This is beneficial to the traffic situation and the livelihood opportunities of rickshaw pullers. Further reductions may be made in the future, depending on the effect of this reduction and the needs of the public. ② Register of rickshaw pullers and contractors: The committee has implemented the recommendation of the 1933 Rickshaw Investigation Committee to compile a register of all rickshaw owners and contractors for verification. Each owner is issued a certificate by the committee and must present the certificate when applying for a vehicle license each month. ③ Reducing rickshaw rent: In April of last year, the daily rent for each vehicle was reduced to 0.77 yuan in national currency, including 0.07 yuan in national currency for rickshaw pullers' contributions to the mutual aid association. Compared with the rent price in the previous three years, it was reduced by about 30%. Compared with the rent price before April last year, it was also reduced by 0.08 yuan in national currency. The owners resolutely opposed this and once stopped renting out vehicles in April last year, in an attempt to coerce the Municipal Council to change its attitude, but they soon yielded and followed the recommendation of the 1933 Rickshaw Investigation Committee. The daily rent for vehicles must not exceed 0.80 yuan in small foreign currency, which is about 0.60 yuan in national currency, plus 0.07 yuan for rickshaw pullers' contributions to the mutual aid association, with a maximum of 0.67 yuan in national currency. The current rent price still exceeds the limit by 0.10 yuan in national currency. The committee hopes that the Municipal Council will continue to pay attention to this in the future. There are now many owners who collect rickshaw rent higher than the price approved by the committee, and they will be punished once the facts are verified. Therefore, thirteen licenses have been detained for one month, eight have been detained for two months, and four have been completely revoked. Although some owners have not been punished, the Municipal Council's investigation has made them fear and pay attention to complying with the rules. ④ Setting rickshaw fares: The committee has set standard rickshaw fares based on distance and time, and has price lists affixed to each rickshaw. ⑤ New vehicles: There are now 4,122 new rickshaws on the streets. These vehicles make passengers feel comfortable and rickshaw pullers feel less effort. ⑥ Rickshaw puller registration: Both public and private rickshaw pullers have been registered and issued licenses, with the puller's photo and fingerprint affixed to the license. The rickshaw pullers must wear armbands when pulling the rickshaw for identification. In January of last year, 36,045 public rickshaw pullers were re-licensed. The purpose of registering rickshaw pullers is to eliminate the old, young, and weak, and to ensure that all rickshaw pullers who can pull a rickshaw have the opportunity to make a living by pulling a rickshaw, so that there is no risk of unemployment due to too many people. ⑦ Vehicle inspection: All vehicles are inspected at any time and are indeed cleaner and safer than in the past. Although the vehicle lights have not been completely improved, they are better than the old ones. ⑧ Parking places for vehicles: The police department of the Municipal Council has designated 92 parking places for public rickshaws, but it is still necessary to persuade rickshaw pullers to park only in designated locations. ⑨ Combating "wild chicken" chartered cars: In order to combat "wild chicken" chartered cars, the procedures for applying for private rickshaw licenses are very strict. The police department spares no effort in prohibiting "wild chicken" chartered car pullers from soliciting passengers. Once discovered, they are subject to a higher fine, and their licenses are temporarily detained for the first offense and revoked for the second offense. Last year, 318 "wild chicken" chartered car pullers were fined for soliciting passengers, and a total of 172 licenses were revoked. Private rickshaw licenses used to be issued quarterly, but from January 1 this year, they will be issued every six months. Since more money is required when applying for a license, the loss is significant once it is revoked, which may prevent "wild chicken" chartered car pullers from easily applying for private rickshaw licenses. There are currently 9,609 private rickshaws in the Public Concession, a decrease of more than 3,000 vehicles compared to 1934. ⑩ Improving the living conditions of rickshaw pullers: The reduction in rickshaw rent has made the burden on rickshaw pullers lighter. Since the establishment of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, the living conditions of rickshaw pullers have been further improved. Although the work of the Mutual Aid Association is often sabotaged, it is still progressing resolutely and its achievements are becoming increasingly apparent. Each association now has clinics, district nurses, classrooms, reading rooms, lecture halls, educational talks, slides and movies, dormitories, bathrooms, tea rooms, game rooms, cafeterias, barber shops, and libraries. Last year, approximately 70,000 rickshaw pullers used these facilities and received relief from the association, almost double the number of the previous year. ⑩① Cooperation with other authorities: The 1933 Rickshaw Investigation Committee suggested that the Municipal Council should consult with the French Concession and Chinese authorities to improve the public rickshaw business in the three urban areas. Although there are no special achievements to report in this regard, judging from the current situation, there is still a possibility of further cooperation in all aspects in the future.

### "Cannons," "Butter," and Other Things

— Zhu Ya

We want bread and "butter," but you feed us with "cannons."

I remember that Hugo, dissatisfied with pointless ceremonies, lightly said in his immortal work "Les Misérables" that it would be interesting if someone were to simultaneously calculate the value of the "salute guns" fired around the world for pointless ceremonies, and how many people were starving at the same time. Although Hugo was only satirizing pointless ceremonies here, his hatred for "cannons" is also evident. In fact, despite the fact that there are many "Nazi" mad dogs in the world who are barking about saving food and clothing, and portraying the glory of sacrifice on the "Mars" altar, we who live in this world filled with the smell of gunpowder and constantly feel threatened by our lives, anyone who is unwilling to be slaughtered and unwilling to be cannon fodder, will feel the sin of war and the abhorrence of "cannons." Even diplomats who used to defend "cannons" cannot help but hate "cannons" and love "butter" at this moment when they smell the thick smell of gunpowder.

At a banquet of the Foreign Press Association in London, British Foreign Secretary Eden, in a speech on seeking international economic cooperation, mentioned the rearmament issue, saying: "The British government feels that it should be as resolute as other rearming countries in expressing the determination necessary for national security, but Britain is unwilling to take this path, because there is a better way. Therefore, it has resolutely decided to seek butter rather than guns, and is prepared to do its best to seek peace in Europe through economic cooperation, so that others can obtain butter in a world where guns are not needed." (According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 13th)

Eden's words may have been directed against the speech made by the spokesperson of "Nazis" at the 10th anniversary of the Berlin Party Headquarters the other day, but at a time when "we want bread and butter, but you feed us with cannons," it can be said to be our envoy, and it is indeed worth writing about and applauding. However, I have to say it back. While applauding, in this utopia depicted for us of "making others all able to obtain butter in a world where guns are not needed," we should not believe too much in illusions, only smile at "butter," and ignore "cannons," because behind the person who said "rather give up cannons and take butter" , he still cannot forget "cannons," and is also expanding armaments and rushing to build "cannons." This is because "cannons" and "butter" have formed an inextricable bond in today's contradictory capitalist society. "Cannons" not only do not hinder "butter," but are also a necessary tool for seizing "butter." It is not necessary to talk about the distant past, just take the current Abyssinia as an example. Abyssinia is not infatuated with utopia, nor is it poisoned by non-resistance, but simply because its "cannons" are inferior to others, it has lost bread and "butter." It is clearly using "cannons" to rob "butter," but the black-shirted Prime Minister Mussolini shamelessly said that he is spreading culture to black people.

These are the tricks about "economic cooperation," "spreading documents," and "cannons" and "butter" on the European and African stages. We can temporarily ignore them; let's look at our East Asia and the tricks about the fate of our own nation.

In our East Asia, in our own country, there are also people who are pointing "cannons" at our chests, while extending their hands to us, saying "friendship," saying "cooperation," saying "coexistence and co-prosperity"... This drama is also extremely wonderful, and it can be said that it does not allow European people to monopolize the beauty. In fact, this is exactly the same drama sung by British Foreign Secretary Eden, but with different Eastern and Western terms. If it were changed to Western terminology, it would be "rather give up cannons and take butter."

Now, I have to say one more thing: While these Eastern and Western stages are pretending to sing "understanding," "friendship," "cooperation," and "rather give up cannons and take butter," we must not ignore the fact that behind those singers, they are massively expanding armaments and rushing to build "cannons"; especially when smiling at "butter," don't forget the lessons that "cannons" have given us. If we only imagine "butter" and smile, and forget the lessons of "cannons," then we are afraid that we will not only not see the shadow of "butter," but even "black bread" will not be able to eat.

In this day and age, if saying this will not cause the danger of being beheaded, then we must loudly proclaim: Not only should we not forget "cannons" when we see "butter"; we must use "cannons" to eliminate "cannons," use force to eliminate force, and use war to eliminate war for the sake of "butter"!

We want bread and "butter," but you feed us with "cannons."

We want peaceful and clear air, but you are spreading gunpowder everywhere in the air...

We who are being slaughtered and invaded should keep this in mind.

### Life

— Li Wen

I was eating with a friend at a small restaurant. That restaurant was very simple, with no "upstairs private rooms," perhaps because it was rented out to another family. The patrons here were mostly small businessmen and single men. Sometimes, there were also a few exiled princes and ministers who drank a few ounces of baijiu and ate two bowls of white rice in broken Shanghai dialect. It was during market hours, and the half-table in front of the statue of Guan Yu was also full of guests. The fat waiter, showing off his flesh, scurried from table to table, shouting out the names of the dishes to the cook in a loud voice. When a guest was about to leave, he quickly calculated the bill in his mind and reported it to the cashier.

The cook was busy cooking on the coal stove, so busy that he didn't even have time to wipe the beads of sweat from his forehead. Reflected in the firelight from the coal stove, his oily face seemed to be smeared with a layer of crimson color. The proprietress at the cashier's counter, although she had time to greet the customers who came in later, was busy collecting and making change. A Golden Mouse brand cigarette was placed on the money board, half-burned.

This interwoven ukiyo-e painting symbolizes a hurried life!

Just then, a six- or seven-year-old child darted in like a mouse through the shadows of people. His eyes, forced by hunger, were almost popping out of their sockets. He held his hands in fists and said a set of "traveling performer" words very uncomfortably, but without any expression. Perhaps he had a foster father, or even had been abducted from a remote place, who forced him to memorize that set of words like an actor using a feather duster or something that could hit him. So he did all kinds of funny tricks on the ground where he was standing, for example, he stuck a feather-bound tail on his butt, imitated the sound of a dog barking, and finally flipped dozens of somersaults continuously on the area of ​​less than two square feet where he was standing. When he turned fast, it seemed like a metal hoop that children played with spinning on the ground. This was the last set of tricks. He stood up, straightened his dark, shiny clothes, recited the set of "traveling performer" words again, and spread out his small hands to ask the guests for money.

I am also a regular customer of this small restaurant, but I had never seen that child before. Perhaps I want to be a little quieter, so I often come earlier to eat. That child performs once and asks for some money, naturally picking the busiest market time. However, looking at the child's greedy eyes that were almost popping out of their sockets, I was worried for him. Would these inept diners be willing to spend one or two more copper coins on top of their dinner for a beggar child? Moreover, it is a common occurrence here that some patrons cannot even gather enough money to pay for their meals, leading to quarrels and fights.

Fortunately, my worry did not become a reality. Almost all the customers in the restaurant contributed. The child received the money, and his face changed to a smile. He shouted "Thank you, gentlemen" and jumped out the door. Now, I don't know how happy he is in his heart. Not only can he go home and have a meal, but he can also avoid a beating!

My friend seemed to have rarely seen this kind of situation before. He told me with emotion that when he was in Harbin, he had visited the home of an old opera performer who specialized in martial arts roles. Those who came to him to become disciples would first learn the trick of tumbling somersaults. The severity of the punishment was truly unbearable to witness. But when he learned to perform on stage and became a popular star, he was a favored child in front of countless audiences. Now, when that child is learning these money-begging skills, he must have suffered a lot of beatings, but he is just a beggar, a beggar who is despised by others!

These words are right, but they cannot be applied to this society as if they were book-based rules. Some of those who graduated from a university became officials, and some ended up on the streets. Did they think that there would be such a huge difference when they were studying? Human life is probably determined in this way, otherwise, it would be difficult to swallow even a meal in a small restaurant.

### Impressions After Seeing "Spring Breeze, Autumn Rain"

— Li Yi

"China Travel" Performing at the Carlton

"China Travel" has achieved a great victory in attracting lagging audiences. Because of this, its achievements in increasing the number of theatergoers and enriching the atmosphere of drama seem to surpass its achievements on stage. Therefore, at the beginning of 1937, "China Travel's" active spirit in rehearsing Mr. A Ying's script and Mr. Tang Kuiqiu's direction of "Spring Breeze, Autumn Rain" is even more worthy of our attention.

The official premiere date of "Spring Breeze, Autumn Rain" was from the 17th, but I watched the trial performance on the morning of the 14th. Judging the performance effect of a trial performance against an official performance is naturally not very accurate. For example, the actors' control over lines and movements, lighting, and sound application will all improve as the number of performances increases! However, regarding the script's composition and direction at the end of the play, we might as well express our feelings based on the results of the trial performance.

The meaning of this play is naturally not bad. It records how the members of the Party spent their days under the iron hooves of the warlords during the Northern Expedition period. It also exposes how some petty bureaucrats sold their souls and betrayed the revolution against their original intentions. Furthermore, it explains how a "Miss" who joined the revolution with romantic dreams inadvertently harmed her comrades because of her desire for material enjoyment and willfulness. Secondly, it uses satirical strokes to mercilessly satirize university professors, bankers, and so-called law and order maintainers.

The shortcomings of this play are also present. The biggest one, in my opinion, is the same as the film "United Hearts in Life and Death": it focuses too much on the members of the Party and neglects the masses. We know that the victory of the revolution, if relying solely on a few Party members to work, cannot be achieved. The most important thing is to align with the demands of the people. However, "Spring Breeze, Autumn Rain," like "United Hearts in Life and Death," mentions the masses very little.

Secondly, in this play, it is very easy to cause the misunderstanding that the revolution inevitably relies on "women" to succeed. Here, the leader of the revolutionary party asks his worries to bewilder Commander Li after twelve o'clock in order to launch a rebellion, and finally, fortunately, Chen Fengyun shoots and kills Li and Xiang. Although the revolutionary army's military songs have already sounded outside at this time, will the audience not say that it was Chen Fengyun who saved Liang Zhongshi and others from danger?

Regarding the composition of the script, the latter two acts are better written than the first two acts. Especially in the first act, the playwright could neither prevent many people from standing on the stage nor find a way to give them all an equal role, but they also could not always have them standing aside. As a result, it seemed very contrived, and even Xiang Hao's appearance on stage had to be dealt with superficially.

Secondly, the impression that the first two acts and the third and fourth acts of "Spring Breeze, Autumn Rain" gave me is not unified. It seems that the first two acts form an independent stage, and the third and fourth acts form another stage. This feeling is not only temporal but also seems to have a different center. The reason for this is probably because the third act overemphasizes the interlude, and the satire of university professors and other scenes is written too heavily, resulting in a situation where the guest overwhelms the host, blurring the audience's understanding of the theme.

However, although the third act destroys the theme and atmosphere in the play as a whole, if you look at it independently, this act is the best written act among the four acts in the entire play. Not only is the way each actor enters and exits the stage very natural, but the scene when the drunkard rushes in is also very responsive between the front and back stages. The method of closing with a scream also feels superior to the closing of the other three acts.

Regarding the final ending, I also have slightly different opinions from Mr. A Ying. I think the relationship between Xiang Hao and Chen Fengyun as nephew and aunt is unnecessary to reveal after Xiang is shot. Isn't it enough for the audience to know their relationship? Why add another "when a person is about to die, their words are virtuous" confession, which is close to the old routine of enlightened drama?

In terms of directing, the best-handled act is also the third act, and the worst is also the first act. The placement in the first act is not only not good-looking, but also the characters are very chaotic due to the limitations of the script. However, the same number of characters in the fourth act is much better.

The best acting skills are from Li Jingbo, who plays Professor Ni, and Tang Huaiqiu's Xiang Hao, whose sophistication and composure are more than adequate.

But when speaking, it is best to pay more attention. Cao Zao's Mandarin has not improved, and I hope he can study hard. Tang Ruoqing is working hard enough, but the grasp of the character is not enough. I hope the writers and directors can give her more help. As for the lines that are lower in one family and higher in another, I also hope that she can pay attention to it herself. Everyone else is also expected to work hard and fulfill their duties. Jiang Ming's role in the script makes us suspect that there are such characters in the revolutionary camp. Although his performance has many gimmicks, the suspicion of whether such characters exist is still the same.

The scenery, sound, and lighting were originally the strengths of "China Travel." The scenery here is still very good, but the sound and lighting feel a little unfamiliar. I think that's because it's a trial performance?

### Tianqiao

— Zhu Lu

——Recalling Beiping

Tianqiao is outside Qianmen, in a desolate and vast sandy field. Many tents are scattered randomly, and the tarpaulins, ravaged by wind and rain, appear worn out. Wooden sticks and ropes support the tents. In Tianqiao, the dune-like undulating tents leave behind the shadow of nomads struggling to survive in the desert.

When the brilliant sun cuts across the dome, Tianqiao becomes lively. Tourists run from all directions, leaving behind a series of chaotic footprints in the thick sand. Many opera troupes gather from the corners in that vast sandy land.

Tourists surround circles. On the field, various Jianghu performers shout loudly, attracting onlookers. The sound of gongs starting the show resounds wildly in each field. In the open-air teahouses, they are busy brewing tea at two big coins per pot.

In several fields, similarly, old men are playing the erhu. Several girls who are not yet adults are wearing tattered cotton-padded jackets, trying their best to raise their throats, their faces flushed red, using all the breath they can muster to sing loudly. When they beg for money with pitiful voices, speaking tragic words, groups of onlookers disperse.

In that desolate sandy land, various sounds and operas from all over the country gather in the big field. Girls sing Dagu, Tangshan's Bengbeng, two guys tell insulting cross-talk with a cold laugh, Fengtian's Luozi, several children tumble on wooden frames, several people play the flower drum opera while knocking on small gongs... Various sounds are mixed, and operas from all over the country are noisy. From the wooden planks, the vibrating and sharp sound of clappers is transmitted. When tourists peer through the cracks in the planks, they see a clown on stage teasing a foreign princess.

In Tianqiao, many poor people are jumping from one field to another, whiling away the time. In the sand, there are rows of tents, and many hawkers also set up stalls, seeping into the interior. The sand on the ground is trampled even more chaotic by tourists.

On the field, there are often burly men wearing hats askew and not buttoning their clothes, swaggering around on patrol. This is the King of Tianqiao—he dominates the entire Tianqiao, cruelly exploiting the impoverished performers and small vendors...

When the sunlight appears red and shines obliquely on Tianqiao, women come out step by step from the simple alleys. Their faces are covered with thick face powder, so white that it looks like white paint has been added. Even in such thick powder, their loneliness cannot be hidden. A pair of eyes are unusually sleepless, lazily pacing, showing a miserable smile to each tourist. That smile, though uglier than crying, is a living for the angels of Tianqiao. The patrol police and hooligans over there rely on them to make a living.

As dusk approaches, Tianqiao slowly becomes deserted. A gust of wind blows, sweeping up the gray sand on the ground, blowing and covering the sky. The northern sandstorm obscures the vast earth.

In the icy and snowy weather, the soldiers who are bravely fighting in the severe cold will make the people in the big cities who are sitting by the stove and embracing their lovers feel that the soldiers at the front are inevitably fools. But for the survival of the entire country, for the peril of the entire nation, our soldiers, who bear such a heavy responsibility, are fighting to the end at the cost of any sacrifice. Finally, they received the support and admiration of countless people; even giving them material and spiritual encouragement, making the soldiers extra spirited and bravely moving forward with heavy burdens!

### "Incarnation Girl" Sequel and Original

Since its premiere at the Carlton Theatre on New Year's Day, the "Incarnation Girl Sequel" has seen increasing box office success, breaking the premiere record for domestic films. Even on the last three days, it was still sold out. It was originally intended to continue showing, but because the theatre had signed a contract with the China Travel Theatre Company in advance, it had to switch to performing a play in accordance with the original schedule. The theatre originally planned to continue showing the sequel after the play performance, but in order to reward the enthusiastic demands of the tens of thousands of audiences in the local area, Yi Hua Film Company was unwilling to delay the matter excessively. It has now been decided to simultaneously show the "Incarnation Girl" sequel and original films at the Xinguang Grand Theatre in the near future, so that those who have not seen these two films can have the opportunity to see the whole picture. Those who have seen it can also watch it again and again, from beginning to end, which is even more interesting, and is likely to be welcomed by the general public. When the first film was released in Jincheng, it caused a sensation in Shanghai, becoming one of the films with the highest business records last year. When the sequel was released in Carlton, the audience's enthusiasm was even greater than before. There were two female viewers who watched it seven times in a row, and there were countless others who watched it two or three times or more, and many invited friends and family to come and enjoy it together, which shows that a good film is never boring to watch a hundred times. This time, the simultaneous release of the two films will make it even more convenient for the audience, and it is expected that it will cause another sensation among Shanghai film fans.
