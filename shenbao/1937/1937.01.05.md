Our country has always advocated peace, but we should also strengthen our national defense and increase our strength. In particular, we must enable the people of the country to live and work in peace, so under the unified leadership of the government this year, we should devote all our efforts to water conservancy and eliminate natural disasters so that people can live in peace and their national strength will naturally increase. We must also make special efforts to unify the thinking of the people of the country. Our party is a revolutionary party, and there is only one path of revolution to take. The road indicated to us by Sun Yat-sen is neither left nor right. We must move forward bravely, neither hesitating nor changing our minds. If we can do this, we can fulfill the teachings of Sun Yat-sen, which are loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace, and consolidate the foundation of our country. After the speech, the meeting adjourned. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Nanjing] The National Government held a Commemorative Week at 10 AM on the morning of the 4th. Dai Chuanxian, Ma Chaojun, Zhang Ji, Deng Jiayan, Jing Xiangyi, Wang Boqun, Chen Shaokuan, Wang Yongbin, Chen Shuren, Chen Xunyong, Chen Qicai, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials from the various Yuan, ministries, and commissions of the National Government, totaling about 500 people, attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony and gave a speech on "The True Meaning of Nationalism." After the speech, the meeting adjourned at 10:30 AM. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Nanjing] Chairman Lin spoke on "The True Meaning of Nationalism" at the National Government Commemorative Week on the morning of the 4th. He first said that the so-called true meaning of nationalism roughly includes two points: (1) Nationalism is the doctrine of seeking national freedom and equality; (2) Nationalism is based on peace and struggle. In summary, it is to use the method of peace and struggle to achieve China's freedom and equality. Then, based on Sun Yat-sen's teachings, he explained the meaning in detail and cited historical facts about the development of nationalism in various countries to prove that nationalism is a doctrine that must be studied in order to achieve national freedom and equality. He also referred to Sun Yat-sen's teachings of peace, struggle, and saving China, saying that this was what Sun Yat-sen entrusted to us on his deathbed, which shows that the meaning of peace is active, not passive. We must use the method of struggle to achieve the desire for peace. Finally, he said that Kemal Atatürk, the leader of the Turkish national revival, once said, "Every Turk can unite around the task of national independence, regardless of everything. No matter how difficult we may be, we must resolutely fight for this matter until the last drop of blood is shed. We want to sign a peace treaty, but if this treaty is not based on the complete independence of the Turkish nation, then our nation will still not be able to resolve its own destiny, and it will never be able to achieve peace." At that time, the situation in Turkey was roughly the same as our country's current position. We hope that our Chinese nation will also always remember this. We only ask for China's freedom and equality and will never allow national sovereignty to be damaged in the slightest. The people of the country must all strive for peace and work for the survival of the nation and the freedom of the country. Only in this way can every person have the strength of every person, and four hundred million people working together with one mind and one heart can definitely realize nationalism.

### Suiyuan Border Temporarily Calm

Opinions of a Certain Party Still Not Consistent; Guerrilla Forces Are Also Extremely Active in Jehol

[Tianjin] Jining Telegram: From the perspective of the general trend in the Suiyuan border war, the reorganization and replenishment of the puppet troops will take a considerable amount of time. Even if this work is completed, they will not have combat effectiveness due to the mood of the people. The opinions of a certain party on directly participating in the war are still not entirely consistent. The views of the central authorities and the Kwantung Army differ, and it is temporarily difficult to issue a mobilization order. Guerrilla forces are lurking in the puppet territory of Jehol, and there will be changes recently, causing a certain party to have concerns about the rear, which also affects their offensive plans. (4th Dispatch)

[Tianjin] Jining Telegram: Since the beginning of the year, morale here has been strong, and the soldiers at the front are well-prepared, waiting only for an order to mobilize. The puppet troops are therefore increasingly fearful. (4th Dispatch)

[Tianjin] North China is stable, and there are unlikely to be any changes in the Chahar-Suiyuan war in the near future. (4th Dispatch)

[Zhangjiakou] A military headquarters issued instructions to the director of the Jiabusi Special Affairs Agency on the 1st, stating that Wang Ying's troops had long been treated favorably by the puppet state but had rebelled, and Zhang Wanqing's troops had followed suit. Li Shouxin's troops have recently been wavering. It will be difficult to command them in the future. To prevent rebellion, Li's troops should be transferred to Duolun for training, and Wang Jingxiu, Zhang Junzhe, and other Jehol puppet troops should be stationed on the front line. On the 4th, a small part of Li's troops had already arrived in Duolun. Currently, there are more than 10,000 puppet bandits from Mengjiang and Jehol stationed in Jiabusi, and more than 1,000 Meng troops stationed in Kangbao. (4th Dispatch)

### Determination to Ban Opium in Hebei and Chahar Will Not Be Postponed

As of now, no one has been arrested or executed in Beiping for selling or consuming drugs. (4th Reuters Dispatch)

### Jiang Zuobin's Thoughts on Inspection

[Nanjing] Jiang Zuobin's recent tour of inspection in the five provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei to inspect local political conditions was very detailed. He has now returned to Nanjing. Reporters visited him on the 4th to ask about his thoughts on the inspection. Secretary Liu Fu gave the interview on his behalf. According to the interview, the governance of officials in the various provinces, especially the county magistrates in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, are mostly young adults who are energetic in promoting all government affairs. However, due to their eagerness for advancement, they inevitably lack carefulness. Most of the county magistrates in Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei are older and more prudent in their work, but their work efficiency is very slow. The police in the five provinces can only be seen in a rudimentary form in the provincial capitals, and the police in the various counties are far from what we hope for in terms of both substance and form. In the future, if we want to improve local politics, the rectification of the police is the primary task. The Baojia system in each province is very good, which is considered the most satisfactory aspect of this inspection. Jiangsu and Zhejiang have the best grain storage, followed by Hunan and Hubei. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)

[Nanjing] Considering that the Capital Police Department has achieved remarkable results in handling police affairs, in order to show encouragement, Minister Jiang Zuobin personally went to the department on the 4th and presented the department's director, Wang Gupan, with a first-class police medal. After the presentation, he also gave a brief speech. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### The Issue of Punishing International Terrorism
I Propose Two Draft Resolutions

[Nanjing] Regarding the issue of punishing international terrorism, the Legal Experts Committee of the League of Nations Administrative Council previously drafted two convention drafts: one is the "Convention for the Suppression and Prevention of Terrorism," and the other is the "Convention for the Establishment of an International Criminal Court." The League of Nations Administrative Council sent them to the governments of all member states for review. Our government recently sent a reply to the League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, accepting the proposal to establish an international criminal court in principle. Regarding the issue of suppressing and preventing terrorism, it stated that the Legal Experts Committee failed to consider the draft resolutions proposed by the Chinese government, which is regrettable. The Chinese government feels that punishing terrorism is difficult due to the existence of concessions, public concessions, and leased territories within the country. It should ask the Legal Experts Committee to study it again and consider the draft resolutions proposed by our government. There are two items: 1. Any country that enjoys consular jurisdiction in another country has a consular court to manage cases involving its nationals. If such nationals commit political acts of terrorism, they should be transferred to the jurisdiction of the local judicial authorities. 2. Any country that does not have concessions, public concessions, or leased territories in another country, and therefore manages part of the administrative affairs, should provide all kinds of convenience when the local judicial authorities punish political acts of terrorism.

### Judicial Yuan Clarifies Two Doubts

[Nanjing] The Judicial Yuan now clarifies the following doubts about whether consolation money can be regarded as an inheritance: (1) Consolation money for family members is a grant to the family members and is not the deceased's inheritance, so there is no question of inheritance. The deceased's debts should not be borne by the family members unless based on the provisions of the Inheritance Section of the Civil Code. They should not be held responsible for the reason that they received consolation money. (2) Even if one of the partners withdraws his capital midway, he should still be considered a partner if he does not declare his withdrawal from the partnership. As for the dissolution and liquidation, if the notice is given but he does not attend the meeting, the liquidation by the remaining partners is not invalid for the non-attending person. However, if the non-attending person disputes the resolutions made during the liquidation, he may still appeal to the court for a judgment. (4th day, Central News Agency dispatch)

### New Year's Reflections

— Fang Zhi

Time flies, and the New Year's Day of the 26th year of the Republic of China has suddenly arrived. On the occasion of the New Year, there is a custom of celebrating. Moreover, today, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has safely returned, and the whole country is rejoicing. This is not only a celebration for the Party and the country but also a celebration for our people. However, at this time of the transition of national fortune and the beginning of the revival of people's livelihood, as we look back on the past sorrows and look forward to the difficulties of the future, we must be vigilant and strive forward, and we must not be complacent and at ease.

I remember that the closing of the Fifth National Congress coincided with the beginning of the 25th year. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, entrusted with the heavy responsibility of the Party and the country, presided over the central government, focusing on both internal stability and external resistance. The spirit and will of the entire people, under the guidance of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, have become consistent. In the past year, the construction of national defense, the opening of roads, the reform of finance, the revitalization of heavy industry, the improvement of agricultural affairs, the victory over bandits, the completion of unification, the abolition of harsh taxes, and the eradication of opium, all are rare achievements in modern Chinese history. The great cause of revival has begun, and the hope of recovery is felt by all. Although the bandits and puppet forces have invaded and their ambitions have not been extinguished, and the Xi'an Incident has brought about extraordinary changes, these external crises and local turmoil have ultimately been resolved due to the sincere appeal of the leader's great personality, the calmness and struggle of the national people, the decisive actions of the Party government, and the loyal and brave service of armed comrades, enabling the country to turn danger into safety and adversity into prosperity. Now, the central government has laid a foundation for suppressing the rebellion, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's spirit of perseverance and calmness has become more evident because of the Xi'an Incident. It is known that where the hearts of the people are and where the expectations of the public lie, even the unscrupulous cannot violate. From now on, the cause of national revival and the merit of resisting foreign aggression will be further guaranteed.

The ancients said that many difficulties can rejuvenate a country, while ease and comfort can lead to its downfall. The perilous environment in which our country finds itself today is truly unprecedented. However, if we can uphold the ambition of self-improvement and, under the guidance of the leader, make plans for reproduction, education, and training, then turning danger into safety and turning weakness into strength is also a matter of expectation. This depends on the efforts of our comrades and compatriots. Now, at the beginning of a year, I carefully consider the times and look at the current situation. I would like to express three meanings to the people of the country.

1.  Eliminate Internal Traitors and Resist Foreign Aggression

In recent years, foreign aggression has been increasing. Resisting aggression and seeking survival has become a unified understanding of the entire country. However, if the national traitors are not eliminated, the collective strength of the national struggle cannot be formed. Today's Mongolian puppets, Han traitors, and remnant Red bandits all want to hold foreign forces to achieve their ambitions and harm the country. Their intentions are all the worst of national traitors. Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate the roots in order to consolidate the foundation of the nation's interior. For internal stability is the way to resist foreign aggression, and eliminating traitors is the way to resist foreign aggression. The recent changes in Xi'an further prove the correctness of this theory. Therefore, sweeping away the Red bandits and eliminating internal traitors should be the most important task of saving the country. At the same time, we should also resist the harassment of bandits and puppet forces with all our strength in order to consolidate our territory. This requires the comrades and compatriots of the country to work together and encourage each other to assist the government in its implementation.

2.  Fulfill One's Responsibilities and Complete Construction

The fundamental belief in saving the country lies in self-reliance. The concrete realization of self-reliance lies in the completion of both spiritual and material construction. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once said, "We must lay the foundation of the nation's morality and spirit through the New Life Movement, and at the same time, we must complete the nation's economic construction through the National Economic Construction Movement." He also said, "As long as everyone does what they can do and strives for self-improvement, the country, no matter how critical, can be saved within a year." Indeed, if all compatriots can uphold the sincerity of saving the country, deeply understand their own responsibilities, follow Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's instructions, follow their duties, and do their best to perform their duties, then the great cause of revival can be achieved, and the revival of national fortune is not far away.

3.  Concentrate Will and Unify Steps

The work of resisting aggression and saving the country must first unify the will of the whole country, concentrate the strength of the whole country, accept the guidance of the central government, adhere to a consistent position, take uniform steps, and make every effort to be successful. Otherwise, if we are indecisive, moving east and west, then the tripod will be broken and the food will be spilled, and we can only wait and see. In the past year, the internal unity of the Party has been consolidated, and the political opinions of all parties have also become consistent. The people of the whole country have expressed their warm trust in the measures of the central government. This is a symbol of national progress. I hope that all patriotic comrades and compatriots in the country can establish the great ambition of saving the country, receive the guidance of the government, and be able to clearly distinguish and criticize all heresies that harm the country, so as to achieve the effect of rectifying the source.

The above three points are only a brief summary of my personal feelings, for the purpose of mutual learning. As for the intention to build and save the country and the overall plan to revive and resist aggression, the central government has a definite policy. I hope that my comrades and compatriots will deeply understand, work together, and strive together with the comrades of the Party and the compatriots of the country.

Due to the rush of typesetting time, the first three paragraphs were omitted and mistakenly connected after the Central Propaganda Department's message to compatriots. I am very happy to reprint the full text to replace the correction.

### The Future of Sino-Japanese Problems

— Li Shengwu

At this time last year, the people of the whole country held boundless hopes for the resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute. This was because the changing political situation in Japan led to the gradual elimination of the confrontational relationship between the military and political parties. A cabinet was formed with the support of the military, and the so-called "dual diplomacy" towards China in the past seemed to be changing towards a unified diplomacy. On our country's side, there had been four full years of preparation. Significant progress had been made in defense equipment and economic construction. Politically, we had progressed from "eradicating internal warfare" to "unifying to resist foreign aggression." Moreover, during this period of preparation, our tolerance towards Japan had reached its limit. With the situation in Japan as it was and the situation in our country as it was, it was fitting that both countries' authorities clearly expressed their intention to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute through diplomatic means. Consequently, the call to adjust Sino-Japanese diplomacy resonated strongly, and the war-weary people of the country were universally delighted, eagerly anticipating the outcome. As for the content of the adjustment, and the scope of the adjustment, they had no time to ask under the expectation.

Now, a year has passed. Looking back at the Sino-Japanese problems of the past year, the wounds Japan has left on us are deeper than ever, and its means of oppression have become even more intensified. On January 4th of last year, with the instigation of the Japanese side, the puppet troops occupied six counties in northern Chahar. On the 17th of the same month, the puppet troops of Li Shou-hsin occupied the Great Qing Gate of Zhangjiakou. This was a blatant encroachment upon our country's territory. On February 26th, the Japanese opened naval and commercial wharves in Dagu. On the 17th of the same month, the Japanese garrison in North China expanded to two and a half times its original size, with personnel reaching over 8,000. On May 17th, Japan continued to increase its troops in North China, with the garrison in Tongzhou alone increasing to 1,000. On June 21st, the newly added Japanese troops were stationed in Fengtai in batches. These actions were a violation of our territorial sovereignty. Even if Japan considered Sino-Japanese relations to be in a state of war, these actions would be violations of wartime regulations. On March 17th, the puppet organization in eastern Hebei established a customs office in Luan County, and our customs officers in Qinhuangdao were withdrawn. This was a seizure of our country's financial administration. On January 4th, Japanese troops set up outposts in Tanggu. On July 10th, Japanese troops clashed with our 29th Army in Tanggu. On September 18th, a clash occurred between Chinese and Japanese guards in Fengtai, and our company commander Sun Xiangting was abducted by the Japanese army. On the 20th of the same month, our garrison in Fengtai was withdrawn to Zhao Jia Zhuang. These were acts of hostility in "wartime." The smuggling of goods that began in January of last year has not yet completely stopped, and on March 31st, Japanese ruffians in Qinhuangdao brutally beat and seriously injured our customs officers. These were events that were extremely difficult for the Chinese people to endure. A careful examination of the above incidents reveals that they were entirely initiated by the Japanese side, and our country did not engage in any provocative actions.

Even under these circumstances, our country has not abandoned diplomatic avenues. However, Japan's diplomatic approach has always been based on an unbreakable conviction: it never treats our country as an independent nation. Therefore, it wants to cooperate with our government to eliminate the "Red bandits" within our territory, and it wants to split our country's sovereignty by demanding the special status of North China. This kind of demand has been openly proposed in diplomatic negotiations, treating our country directly as its dependency. As of now, according to the press, Sino-Japanese diplomacy has yielded no results whatsoever. However, the bandit and puppet troops in Suiyuan, under the instigation of the Japanese side, have already begun attacking our territory, and the Japanese navy in Qingdao has also landed troops due to a strike at a Japanese cotton mill. At this juncture, everyone wants to ask: Is Sino-Japanese relations going to officially break into war? What effect is diplomacy having now? How will the Sino-Japanese dispute ultimately end?

Regarding the matter of "war," since the September 18th Incident, general public opinion initially speculated that the great powers would intervene in the war. Later, it advocated that our side resort to force, or speculated that Japan would launch a war against us. After four or five years, it has been fully proven that all of the war theories were either premature or ended up being empty talk. The two battles of Shanghai and the Great Wall both had the reality of "war" but not the name of "war," both had the beginning of "war" but not the end of war. Therefore, based on legal interpretations alone, China and Japan are still in a state of stalemate, neither war nor peace, neither non-war nor non-peace.

The victory or defeat of war, once it erupts, will sooner or later need a conclusion. The considerations, obstacles, and even difficulties in between are countless. Moreover, the wars of modern countries are different from those of ancient times, and the wars of civilized countries are even more different from the wars of barbarian nations. The armies of modern countries have precise and complete organizations and complex and sensitive operations. Just in terms of military mobilization, once mobilization begins, it is extremely difficult to stop it midway. This is because the concentration, dispersal, deployment, transportation, and supply of the army must have a complete and meticulous plan and precise and comprehensive schedule. Once a mobilization order is issued, the country's railways, highways, post offices, and other public utilities are all set in motion. The entire mobilization process, from the beginning to the completion of the mobilization, is intense and non-stop. The start of "war" is hastened after the mobilization is completed. However, the mobilization itself is not yet "war." On July 28, 1914, the Russian Tsar gathered his generals and ordered them to begin mobilization, but only to move troops to a certain location in the front. At that time, the generals replied to him: In the modern situation, mobilization is complete and cannot be partial.

If we want to ask whether Japan will start a war with us, in addition to the military questions mentioned above, we also need to study whether, under the current international situation, our country is its enemy—its only enemy. Do its political and economic demands on us have means other than war to achieve their goals? On our country's side, due to the crisis of national fortune, the surging of popular sentiment, and even the suitability of the international environment, it has become necessary to resort to war, or it has already exceeded the necessity. However, what we worry about is whether the preparations of the past few years are sufficient, and if the military strength is not enough, what remedial methods are there. Besides "war," are there still opportunities and strategies to surpass the opponent and recover lost territory? These are all matters that urgently need to be answered regarding the "war" issue.

Moreover, once a war begins, the governments and people of the belligerent countries are permeated with war sentiment and are driven to seek war to escalate, without interruption or cessation, in order to achieve their final wishes. During the European War, the slogans shouted by the belligerent countries were: "Once a country joins a war, it should continue the war so that the country can obtain compensation from the war." "If war has no results, war will have to be waged sooner or later." "We can only leave it to our children and grandchildren to continue fighting in order to achieve a satisfactory resolution." Some even shouted, "Continue the war until we all perish together." This kind of war sentiment is not brewed in a day, and it is even more difficult to eliminate. Secondly, there is also the seasoned and prudent view that hinders the cessation of "war" midway, which is to prevent future wars by fighting, not only preventing the current war but also preventing all future wars, the so-called "fighting to eliminate war." This is the meaning of the view, but this concept has no influence on the beginning of war but has a great impetus on the continuation of war. Furthermore, "war" has a purpose, its purpose is reparations, cession of territory, and even all other desires, and the purpose of war continues to increase with the prolongation of the war, the desires of the victorious countries are insatiable, and the losses of the defeated countries are greater, and the desire for war is stronger, aiming to achieve the goal of turning defeat into victory, so the longer the war lasts, the more demands the belligerent countries make, and the more demands, the longer the war lasts.

Current Commentary

### National Government Pardons Zhang Xueliang

— Gao

Yesterday, the National Government Committee discussed the case of pardoning Zhang Xueliang. After careful discussion, it was passed. The National Government formally issued an order to pardon the original sentence and handed him over to the Military Affairs Commission for strict supervision. The Xi'an Incident, which once shook the country, thus came to a complete conclusion. The disaster of infighting was avoided, and the worry of division was completely dispelled. This is truly the only great achievement since the New Year and a sign of the consolidation of the country's future. After rejoicing, I venture to add a few words.

When the Xi'an Incident occurred, amidst our shock and panic, we could hardly imagine the development of this unfortunate event. The difficulty faced by the government in dealing with it was the cause of our anxiety. Fortunately, the situation took a sharp turn, and the animosity turned into peace. This was due to the inspiration of justice, and the fact that the responsible party was able to rein in on the brink of disaster, humbling themselves. The swiftness of their repentance deserves commendation. The decision of the Central Political Conference to hand him over to the Military Affairs Commission for punishment was to uphold the discipline of the nation. The trial by the military court sentencing him to ten years' imprisonment was to maintain the dignity of the judiciary. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's request for pardon was to promote the consolidation of unity. The discussion and passage by the National Government Committee was to provide a path for self-renewal. Facts and prestige were not in conflict. If the Xi'an Incident had such a result, could it be considered barely satisfactory?

From this, we can gain a stern lesson, that is, in the face of the country's decline today, no one can afford to ignore national affairs. Even if there are differences in opinion, we should try to resolve them. We must not rely on narrow-mindedness to invite the disaster of division. The Xi'an Incident is a clear example. After this twist and turn, I know that there must be a more sincere understanding between the central and local authorities. Zhang Xueliang, who has just received the pardon, must be able to maintain his genuine sincerity and steadfastly adhere to the duty of obedience so that military orders and military administration can be unified, and the development of national power will become smoother. I am not clever, but I will wait and see.

### British Air Force Increases by 50%

[London] According to The Daily Telegraph, the strength of the British air force has increased. The newspaper states that the number of aircraft in each squadron has increased, with the largest increase being 50%. In the future, fighter squadrons will have 14 aircraft, bomber squadrons will have 12, and the average strength of naval air squadrons has also increased from four to six aircraft. The newspaper continues to say that the government wants to increase the number of aircraft stationed on the country's borders to a total of 1,750. The number of naval aircraft will be doubled to a total of 440. At the same time, the number of border defense aircraft stationed overseas will also be increased. (4th National Telegram)

### Anglo-Italian Friendship Strengthened, Mediterranean Agreement Announced

Mutual Respect for Rights in the Mediterranean, Italy Does Not Covet Spanish Territory

[London] The Anglo-Italian Gentlemen's Agreement on the Mediterranean was signed in Rome on January 2nd. The full text of the agreement and the letters exchanged between the two governments were released at midnight today. The translation is as follows:

(1) The Anglo-Italian Gentlemen's Agreement on the Mediterranean signed on January 2nd: "The British Government and the Italian Government, hoping to increase their contribution to the maintenance of peace and to improve relations between Great Britain and Italy and the countries of the Mediterranean, have decided to respect each other's rights and interests in the Mediterranean, and recognize that the freedom of navigation and passage of ships in the Mediterranean is of great importance to both the British Empire and Italy, as well as to other countries. Therefore, the two countries declare that they do not wish to change the status quo of the Mediterranean or the sovereignty of the countries in the Mediterranean, and declare that this agreement is in no way directed against any other country."

(2) Letter from the British Ambassador to Italy, Drummond, to Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano, December 31: "On December 16, several members of the House of Commons in my country raised questions to Foreign Secretary Eden, asking whether the content of the guarantee provided by the Italian government to the British government regarding the occupation of the Spanish-owned Balearic Islands by Italian nationals could be submitted to the House of Commons for review. Foreign Secretary Eden replied, 'This guarantee is verbal,' and said that 'The British Chargé d'Affaires in Italy, England, was instructed by his government to notify Italian Foreign Minister Ciano on December 9 that if there were any changes in the status quo of the western Mediterranean, the matter would be closely watched by the British government.' At that time, the Italian Foreign Minister immediately gave England a guarantee, saying that 'Before and after the outbreak of the Spanish Revolution, the Italian government has never conducted negotiations with General Franco on changing the status quo in the western Mediterranean, and will not conduct such negotiations in the future.' Foreign Secretary Eden further stated that 'The above guarantee was later reaffirmed by the Italian Naval Minister to the naval attaché of the British Embassy in Italy, and the same guarantee was repeatedly given verbally to the British Foreign Secretary by the Italian Ambassador to the UK, Grandi.' All of the above is to invite the Italian government to consider, and my government therefore assumes that, as far as Italy is concerned, the existing territory of Spain will remain intact under any circumstances and will not be changed. My government will be very happy if Your Excellency can formally confirm this assumption to prove its accuracy. I do not know if Your Excellency can make this confirmation. I hereby send this letter to inquire."

(3) Reply from Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano to British Ambassador to Italy Drummond on the same day. The reply first restates the questions raised by Drummond, and then says, "I hereby, on behalf of my government, confirm that the assumptions of your government are very accurate. In other words, as far as Italy is concerned, the existing territory of Spain will remain intact under any circumstances and will not be changed." (3rd Havas Dispatch)

[London] The agreement does not mention the British recognition of the Italian East African Empire or naval power. Its main value is psychological, as it shows that Great Britain and Italy have returned to good terms after the Italian-Ethiopian War. (4th Reuters Dispatch)

### Britain Satisfied

[London] After the Anglo-Italian Gentlemen's Agreement was signed, semi-official circles expressed satisfaction, but believed that the clauses contained in this agreement should not be overemphasized. While Italy wants to strengthen its friendship with Great Britain, it still wants to maintain friendly relations with Germany. Therefore, Italy's current attitude will not change, and it does not intend to take any measures that would cause Germany to be alarmed. However, it can be expected that countries that are eager to guarantee peace in Europe, such as Great Britain, can now obtain Italy's assistance to jointly promote the cause of peace. It is also rumored that France will soon fully restore normal relations with Italy, and well-informed people attach great importance to this statement. (4th Havas Dispatch)

[London] The views of the various newspapers here on the Anglo-Italian Gentlemen's Agreement that was recently concluded are quite inconsistent. The Conservative Party newspapers believe that Italy will cooperate with peace-loving countries again on international issues in the future, but the Liberal Party and Labour Party newspapers have doubts about this. The Times wrote, "It is a good thing that the international tension has come to an end, but how this situation was created in the first place should be remembered forever to avoid repeating the same mistakes. In short, the past has become history because of the conclusion of the agreement between Great Britain and Italy. At the same time, Italy has made a clear statement that it will not covet the Spanish-owned Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean. This move has contributed more to the non-interference issue in the Spanish Civil War than anything else. The foundation for the effective implementation of the non-interference policy has also been expanded as a result. This should be especially welcomed." The Conservative Party's Daily Telegraph wrote, "It is satisfactory that Great Britain and Italy have mutually guaranteed respect for the status quo in the Mediterranean. In addition, Italy has made a promise that it has no territorial ambitions in Spain, which is also extremely beneficial to international negotiations." The Conservative Party's Morning Post wrote, "In the history of diplomacy, there are not many agreements that are as fortunate as this one. The guarantee provided by Italy to respect the territorial integrity of Spain is particularly satisfying." The Liberal Party's News Chronicle wrote, "There is no doubt that this Anglo-Italian agreement is sufficient to promote peace and is very beneficial to the cause of cooperation with European countries. However, there is one condition, that is, this agreement should be strictly observed in both spirit and letter." The Labour Party's Daily Herald wrote, "At the time when the Anglo-Italian Gentlemen's Agreement was signed, news came that more than 5,000 Italian soldiers landed in Cadiz, Spain, and went to the front to join the war. So what is the true intention of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini? Is Italy being pressured by Germany to send these troops to show that it has decided not to accept the notes previously proposed by Great Britain and France? Or is it to satirize Germany, saying that the Gentlemen's Agreement does not hinder the close cooperation between Germany and Italy? At this time, the expression of facts is more important than empty talk on paper. However, British Foreign Secretary Eden and the Foreign Office could not wait to sign the Gentlemen's Agreement and were satisfied with empty words. What is their motive? It is difficult to understand." (4th Havas Dispatch)

### Italy Jubilant

[Rome] The Italian newspapers have all expressed jubilation over the agreement, saying that the policies of Great Britain and Italy can now run in parallel without conflict. The Italian government's mouthpiece, Gayda, declared that this Gentlemen's Agreement has invisibly eliminated the recent animosity between the two countries, that is, the handshake after the resolution of the conflict as the British say. (4th Reuters Dispatch)

[Rome] The semi-official "Messenger Newspaper" recently commented on the agreement concluded between Great Britain and Italy on the Mediterranean, stating that the meaning of the agreement concluded between Italy and other countries, especially the agreement between Italy and Germany, has not been reduced as a result. "It can be asserted that the Anglo-Italian agreement will be an effective tool for stabilizing the European situation in the future. The Italian government has never believed in the theory that the conflict between Great Britain and Italy is unavoidable, but it is necessary for both parties to conclude this agreement under the current situation." In addition, French Foreign Minister Daladier made a statement to our reporter yesterday, expressing his joy over the Anglo-Italian agreement, and said that the strengthening of friendship between Great Britain and Italy is an important factor in guaranteeing peace. This statement was reprinted by the Messenger Newspaper and other newspapers and was given great importance. The Roman People's Daily said, "The traditional friendly relations between Great Britain and Italy are not created by a certain cabinet minister or a certain monarch, but are a geographical necessity. It is necessary to know that although Great Britain's national strength is strong, it will not be able to cope with events in three or four places in the world at the same time. The past grievances between Great Britain and Italy were caused by misunderstandings. Now it is a good thing to return to good terms." (3rd Havas Dispatch)

### German Reaction

[Berlin] The Anglo-Italian Mediterranean Agreement has aroused serious attention here. The newspapers especially mentioned the words of the Italian Daily, which stated that this agreement will not affect German-Italian relations. Or it is said that Germany has been isolated in the Spanish national movement. "The Morning Post" said that this article has made this statement powerless. The semi-official Italian organ solemnly declared that there is no divergence of opinion between Berlin and Rome on the Spanish issue. The Frankfort Newspaper's correspondent in Rome said that the "handshake" between Great Britain and Italy does not indicate the complete solution of the Mediterranean issue, and there are still many issues related to the two countries that need to be studied. The correspondent said that this agreement does not directly mention the third country, that is, France, which is very concerned about Anglo-Italian relations, has not been mentioned due to Italy's intentions. (4th National Telegram)

### France Praises

[Paris] After the Anglo-Italian Gentlemen's Agreement on the Mediterranean issue was concluded, political figures here unanimously praised it, saying that it is an element that strengthens peace in Europe. Although some parties have expressed doubts about the effectiveness of the Anglo-Italian agreement and fear that Italy may not change its policy of understanding with Germany, or will continue to actively interfere in the Spanish Civil War, only a few people hold this view. (3rd Havas Dispatch)

### German Warships Repeatedly Detain Spanish Ships, Relations Between the Two Countries Become Strained Again

Spanish Authorities Consider the Situation Serious, German Commander Demands Restoration of Detained People and Goods

Bilbao The German warship Königsberg, disregarding the Spanish government's serious protests, again detained the Spanish ship Mateochikla outside the port of Santona today. The Governor of Bilbao, Volazaren, has sent a letter to the commander of the ship, demanding that the ship be released immediately. Otherwise, he will consider this move an intentional provocation and will have to take serious countermeasures. According to reports, the Mateochikla sailed from Bilbao to Santo Tomé, carrying potatoes and other food. (3rd National Telegram)

[Paris] It is learned that after the German cruiser Königsberg inspected two Spanish merchant ships, namely the Aragon and the Sutton, in Spanish waters a few days ago, it also intercepted the Spanish Republic government's merchant ship Mateo Chiclayo in the waters of the Basque Country in western Spain. (4th Havas Dispatch)

Valencia The Information Department of the Republican Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a communiqué stating that the German cruiser Königsberg again detained a Spanish merchant ship yesterday off the coast of Cabo Ajo in the Basque Autonomous Region in northern Spain. The ship sailed from the port of Bilbao to the port of Santo Tomé, carrying 600 tons of various goods. In addition, the communiqué stated that the commanders of the German warships stationed in Spanish waters had indeed telegraphed the Republican Government, stating that they were willing to release the detained cargo ship Aragon and stop all retaliatory actions, but only if the Basque Autonomous Region government of Spain released a Spanish passenger named Barrosque and returned the detained goods. The communiqué then restated and commented on the fact that the Königsberg detained the Aragon and the Sutton. "The Königsberg's behavior clearly violates the provisions of international law, and its nature is no different from an act of war against an autonomous country. After reviewing the situation, the Republican government has decided not to be pressured by the German naval commander and will not respond to his telegram, because its form and content are unacceptable to an autonomous country. The Republican government previously believed that the danger of international conflict was increasing, and this view has now been fully confirmed. If the causes of the conflict are not resolved quickly, the impact may be irreparable. In view of the situation and its severity, the Republican government has decided to take all necessary diplomatic measures." (4th Havas Dispatch)

[Paris] Spanish Ambassador to France Aralquistain told the Associated Press today that he had spoken to the Foreign Minister of his country, who explained that the ultimatum of the German cruiser Königsberg was under consideration by the cabinet and would probably be rejected. The detention of the German ship Barroso by the Basque authorities was in accordance with international law. After receiving instructions from his government, he would visit the French Foreign Ministry to inform them of the seriousness of the situation. Germany's actions were tantamount to a declaration of war and had created a serious situation that threatened peace in Europe. The Spanish government would take various diplomatic and military measures to defend itself. Spain has not joined the Non-Intervention Committee and has therefore been unable to raise the matter with the committee, but Germany has indeed violated Articles 10, 11, and 13 of the League of Nations Covenant. The Spanish government will apply to the League of Nations and the International Court of Justice in The Hague. (3rd National Press Telegram)

### Spanish Rebels Search British Ship

British Envoy Lodges Protest; French and Russian Ships Also Stopped

[London] The incident in which the British merchant ship "Black Sea" was inspected by a Nationalist warship in the northwestern waters of Spain was rumored to have been carried out by the German cruiser "Nurnberg." This has since been proven incorrect. However, the news has caused quite a stir here. It is reported that Sir Chilton, the British Ambassador to Spain, has lodged a protest with the Nationalist government in Burgos. There is no news yet on whether the British government will send more warships to the Spanish coast or issue new instructions. (Havas, 4th)

[London] Regarding the inspection of the British merchant ship "Black Sea" by a Nationalist warship in the northwestern waters of Spain, it has been confirmed by official sources that Sir Chilton, the British Ambassador to Spain, has been instructed to lodge a strong protest with the Nationalist government in Burgos. These sources also stated that the British merchant ship "Ethel Rickmers," which sailed from Haifa, Egypt, to Liverpool, England, on December 31st, was fired upon by a fishing boat belonging to the Nationalists. The shipowner protested to the Nationalist authorities and requested that similar incidents be prevented. To protect the safety of its merchant ships, the British government immediately dispatched a destroyer to Cadiz, southern Spain, on the same day. Although Britain de facto recognizes the right of both sides in the Spanish Civil War to inspect ships within the three-mile territorial waters, it does not do so de jure. As for inspections outside territorial waters, it is absolutely intolerable. Even within territorial waters, inspections must be carried out by official warships under legal conditions. The Nationalist authorities may argue that this is necessary to crack down on arms smuggling, but neither the British merchant ship "Black Sea" nor "Ethel Rickmers" was smuggling contraband, so there was no need to inspect them, let alone fire upon them. (Havas, 4th)

Hengtai: Britain today ordered its ambassador to Spain, Sir Chilton, to protest to the Spanish rebels about the attack on the British merchant ship "Blair Castle." At the same time, the German government's news agency in Berlin and the owner of the ship in Newcastle, England, denied that the German warship "Konigsberg" had ordered it to stop sailing. However, they stated that a fishing boat had fired sixteen shots at it in the Bay of Biscay, all of which missed. The ship is currently in Santander. (National Telegram, 3rd)

Bayonne, France: The French merchant ship "Red Rock" was intercepted and inspected by a warship belonging to the Spanish government forces off the coast of Santurtzi, Spain, but was soon released. (Havas, 3rd)

### 1937 Japanese Diplomatic Policy

No Longer Able to Stand Aside from the Developments in Europe; Striving to Resolve Pending Issues with China and Russia

[Tokyo] Japan's independent and proactive diplomacy has now entered its second year and will be further promoted in terms of construction, with a focus on diplomacy with Europe to achieve true diplomatic activeness. The new trends are roughly as follows:

1.  European Policy

Due to the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany, the economic cooperation between Japan and Italy, and other relationships, Japan can no longer stand aside from the development of the European political situation. Like other countries, it will have to participate in the front lines of European diplomacy. To strengthen its lineup, the Director of the European and Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Togo, will be transferred to the Netherlands as ambassador; the Director of the Information Department, Amau, will be transferred to Switzerland as minister; the Director of the Research Department, Kurihara, will be transferred to Romania as minister; the Director of the Treaty Bureau, Kuriyama, will be transferred to Sweden as minister; and the Counselor to the Soviet Union, Sakei, will be transferred to Finland as minister. In East Asia, for the sake of promoting the nation, attention must be paid to relations with China and the Soviet Union. At the same time, in Europe, this will also be the focus. It is planned to establish a cooperative lineup.

2.  Continental Policy

Relations with the Soviet Union will start with resolving pending issues to rebuild them. At the same time, efforts must be made to reverse the deteriorating situation in relations between the two countries. Efforts will be made to resolve various pending issues in relations with China, and it goes without saying that cooperation must be achieved through the unity of the people of both countries. Assistance should be given to China's demands and hopes. At the same time, economic work should be the fundamental principle of the policy towards China, and efforts should be made to improve the welfare of the people. (Allied Press, 4th)

[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Arita will broadcast a radio address at 7:30 PM on the 5th to the general public, thoroughly explaining the spirit and purpose of the Anti-Comintern Pact concluded between Japan and Germany last year. He also intends to clarify this intention to China and abroad. (Allied Press, 4th)

### Bulgarian-Yugoslav Rapprochement

Budapest: The friendship treaty planned to be established between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia is about to be signed. Hungarian political figures hope that the effect of this treaty will not be to draw Bulgaria into the Balkan Entente (composed of Yugoslavia, Romania, Turkey, and Greece), but to cause Yugoslavia to part ways with its allies. Therefore, they declare that the establishment of a friendship treaty between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia does not mean abandoning the claim to revise treaties and joining the Balkan Entente.

[Berlin] It was officially announced here that Germany has taken "necessary measures" to have the Spanish leftist government release the German merchant ship "Palos," which was detained yesterday.

### French Parliament Recesses for New Year, Budget Passed

Deficit Reaches Over 5 Billion Francs; Forced Arbitration Law for Labor and Management Also Passed

[Paris] Today, the Senate passed the slightly amended budget bill by a vote of 255 to 32. After debating the amendments, the House passed it by a vote of 467 to 75. At the same time, it adopted the Senate's explanation of the financial reform bill. (Reuters, 1st)

[Paris] After three days of discussion by the Senate and the House, the budget for 1937 was formally passed yesterday night. Its total revenue is 42,752,000,000 francs, and its total expenditure is 48,146,000,000 francs. The difference between revenue and expenditure is a total deficit of 5,394,000,000 francs. Thus, the session of the 1936 Parliament ended, and the first meeting of the 1937 Parliament session is scheduled to be held on the 12th of this month. (Havas, 2nd)

[Paris] The Forced Arbitration Bill for Labor Disputes proposed by the government was passed by the House of Representatives by a vote of 490 to 67 after being amended back and forth by the Senate and the House, and thus became law. The point of disagreement between the Senate and the House was how the Supreme Arbitrator should be appointed when the opinions of the arbitrators of both labor and management are inconsistent. The Senate argued that it should be appointed by the President of the Supreme Court (in the Seine Province) or the Presidents of the various Courts of Appeal (in the provinces). The House argued that it should be appointed by the government. The Senate then suggested that the Supreme Arbitrator should be selected from among senior judges, members of the Council of State, and auditors of the Ministry of Finance for adjudication. However, it did not specify which agency should make the appointment, so that the government would also have the power to appoint. After this amendment, the House passed it today. (Havas, 1st)

### Sharp Increase in Shanxi Province's Exports Last Year

Cotton, mountain goods, hides and furs, and coal: income reached 50 million yuan

Taiyuan correspondence: The Shanxi provincial authorities have been committed to revitalizing the countryside and promoting production in recent years, with significant results. Although the rural areas of western and southern Shanxi suffered from natural disasters and banditry in the 25th year, the export volume was still higher than in previous years. According to economic statistics, the value of agricultural products exported in the 24th year reached approximately 40 million yuan, while in the 25th year, it exceeded 50 million yuan. Therefore, the economic situation in the rural areas of various counties in the 25th year should be more active than in previous years. The export situation of major agricultural products in the 25th year is recorded separately as follows:

㊀ Cotton: Since the government vigorously promoted cotton planting and expanded cotton acreage, cotton fields have become widespread throughout the province. Except for the counties in southern Shanxi where the harvest was lower due to drought in the summer, statistics show that the harvest throughout the province was more than 400,000 bales, reaching approximately 50 million catties, an increase of approximately 20 million catties compared to the 30 million catties produced in the 24th year. After deducting 150,000 bales required by yarn factories such as Jinhua, Dayi, and Yongyu, and 50,000 bales needed by households, half were transported to other provinces for sale.

㊁ Mountain Goods: The output of mountain goods such as walnuts in the province is the highest among the provinces in North China. The export volume in the 25th year was around 5 million yuan, with walnuts accounting for the majority.

㊂ Hides and Furs: The sales of hides and furs in the 25th year were extremely prosperous, unprecedented in previous years. According to statistics, the annual export of hides and furs in Jiaocheng County alone exceeded 400,000.

㊃ Coal: The province is extremely rich in coal reserves. The volume exported throughout the year via the Zhengtai and Tongpu railways has increased sharply compared to previous years. In addition, exports in terms of grain, iron goods, woolen fabrics, and cotton fabrics have also increased sharply compared to previous years. In recent months, a large amount of legal tender has come from foreign exchange through various banks, and merchants from various places have also gathered in the province to purchase agricultural products.

### Guangdong Banks to Offer Goods Mortgage Loans During the New Year Period

The City Chamber of Commerce Requests Flexible Borrowing and Mortgage Methods: Proposes Supplementary Measures for Adoption by the Authorities

Guangzhou correspondence: The Provincial Bank and the City Bank have recently responded to the request of the business community to provide industrial and commercial loans so that merchants can manage their finances during the annual New Year period. The Provincial Bank has already finalized the regulations for large commercial goods mortgage loans (i.e., acceptance bills), which are roughly as follows: ㊀ For those who borrow from the bank, the mortgaged goods will be subject to the agreement that the borrower has full disposal rights, and the borrower will be responsible for compensating the bank for any losses. ㊁ If the borrower fails to repay the principal and interest of the loan upon maturity, the bank has the right to directly sell the mortgaged goods freely. ㊂ The proceeds from the sale will first be used to deduct the loan. If it is insufficient, the bank may still pursue the remaining debt from the borrower. ㊃ The funds obtained from the sale of mortgaged goods, in addition to clearing the principal and interest of the loan and expenses, if there is a surplus, the bank may use it to repay other accounts owed by the borrower to the bank. ㊄ If the mortgaged goods are damaged or the market price falls, the borrower shall immediately replace the mortgaged goods or increase them to a considerable extent, or repay a portion of the cash first. If this is not done, the bank may directly sell the mortgaged goods to repay the debt. ㊅ The borrower of the mortgaged goods shall insure fire insurance with the insurance company designated by the bank in the name of the bank, and if necessary, may notify the borrower to add other types of insurance. ㊆ If the insurance is not taken out, the bank may handle it on behalf of the borrower. ㊇ If the borrower does not fulfill the mortgage loan contract, the guarantor shall compensate the amount as specified in the guarantor's liability mortgage loan contract. After repaying the principal and interest, the bank does not need to seek the borrower's consent and will transfer the mortgaged goods to the guarantor for management, and the receipt for the mortgaged goods issued to the borrower will be invalid. As for the industrial and commercial loans of more than 500 yuan opened by the City Bank, the loan methods are divided into ㊀ mortgage loans with market-priced liquid goods, ㊁ mortgage loans with valuable securities, and ㊂ mortgage loans with other valuable mortgaged goods that the bank deems qualified. The above three types of mortgage loans will be opened from December 31st.

From the business community's perspective, the acceptance bills (i.e., mortgage loans for goods and securities) handled by the above two banks only benefit a portion of merchants. Others who have real estate that can be mortgaged but do not have goods to mortgage still do not receive practical benefits. Therefore, when the Guangzhou City Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of various merchants, it was resolved to supplement five borrowing methods and request the authorities to instruct the provincial and municipal banks to adopt and implement them. The Chamber of Commerce's supplementary borrowing methods are as follows: ㊀ If a store's borrowing is not mortgaged with goods or securities, it may use real estate in the city as collateral. ㊁ When mortgaging real estate in the city for borrowing, if the property is deemed insufficient to offset the loan, a commercial firm may be used as a guarantee. ㊂ When mortgaging the business registration certificate of an existing business in the city, a reliable commercial firm must be used as a guarantee. ㊃ For the above three types of mortgage loans, the bank should be flexible in handling the originally established mortgage loan procedures and should investigate and release the loans within one week from the date of application to facilitate the process. If the City Chamber of Commerce is required to assist in the investigation, the Chamber will assist in handling it at any time. ㊄ The bank should provide a response on whether or not the loan can be granted no later than two weeks from the date of receiving the application.

### Guangdong Province to Levy Income and Business Taxes Starting from New Year's Day

Unbearable Double Burden in a Declining Business Market: The Chamber of Commerce Requests Separate Postponement and Suspension

Guangzhou correspondence: Starting from New Year's Day in the 26th year in Guangdong Province, the entire income tax will be levied, and at the same time, Guangdong Province's unique business tax will also be extended to the entire province (what was previously implemented was only limited to a corner of Guangzhou City). The Chamber of Commerce has held a meeting to discuss these two new taxes and believes that if income tax is levied, business tax should be suspended. If the two are implemented at the same time, the declining business market will not be able to bear the burden. Therefore, it was resolved to petition the Ministry of Finance to exempt the business tax and to postpone the income tax announced to be levied on New Year's Day to March 1st of the 26th year. If the income tax is levied on January 1st, merchants will definitely not be able to handle it in time because merchants are busy closing their accounts during the Lunar New Year period, and it is impossible to switch to the new bookkeeping method at once. In addition to petitioning the Ministry of Finance to consider the merchants' difficulties and approve the request for postponement, a letter was also sent to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for assistance. As for the implementation of the business tax, the Department of Finance is actively proceeding and it seems difficult to reverse the order. The implementation of the business tax in various counties and cities is to divide the entire province into seven business tax areas, with a business tax bureau set up in each area. The bureau is divided into a collection office and an adjudication group, with a total of twenty collection offices and seven adjudication groups. Each bureau is graded according to the scope of business, and the size of the bureau is determined, such as Guangzhou City, which is a well-known commercial port in China, so a first-class bureau in the Guangzhou area will be established. The adjudication group does not need to be established because Guangzhou City has been implementing the business tax for many years. In addition, the Guangzhou-Hui area tax bureau is classified as second-class and is located in Foshan. The Chaozhou-Meizhou area tax bureau is classified as second-class and is located in Shantou. The Qiongya area tax bureau is classified as second-class and is located in Haikou. The Zhaoqing-Yangjiang-Luoding area tax bureau is classified as third-class and is located in Gaoyao County. The Gaozhou-Leizhou-Lianjiang area tax bureau is classified as third-class and is located in Beihai. The Nanshao-Lianzhou area tax bureau is classified as third-class and is located in Shaoguan. The expenses for each bureau are set at 1,200 yuan per month. Each bureau is equipped with one director, two first-class staff members, five second-class staff members, and one third-class employee. Each collection office has two or four locations, depending on the prosperity of the business tax revenue. Each office is equipped with one director. The directors of each bureau and the directors of each office were appointed by the Department of Finance on December 29th and went to the designated locations to prepare everything. Each bureau is required to be established on January 1st. As for the business tax collection regulations, they were formulated in the 20th year of the Republic of China and were limited to collection in one city at that time. The time and place are different now, and the tax standards and tax rates in the regulations are mostly inconsistent with the current legal provisions. Therefore, the Department of Finance has specially formulated new regulations for promulgation, which will be implemented on January 1st. The scope of taxation is the goods sales industry, and the tax standard is the total business income. As for the tax rate, it is set at 5 to 10 per thousand. As for those who are exempt from business tax, five specific items are listed: ㊀ the business of public legal entities, ㊁ the tobacco and alcohol industry that has already been taxed by the central government, ㊂ businesses for public welfare purposes (approved by the government), ㊃ the printing and publishing industry of newspapers, ㊄ banks organized as joint-stock companies that have already been taxed by the central government, and factories that have paid factory tax. It is also rumored that some businesses can only profit a few yuan for every thousand yuan. If the tax is levied according to the total business income, it may be unfair. It is planned to tax businesses with too low profits based on the amount of capital.

### Southern Fujian Bans the Circulation of Similar Paper Money

Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Sanmei Exchange Bureau Goes Bankrupt: Due to Issuing Credit Notes and Suffering a Bank Run: Total Debts Estimated at 140,000-150,000 Yuan

Xiamen Correspondence: Since the unification of the national currency system, the government has strictly prohibited local banknotes and folk vouchers similar to paper money. On the 30th of last month, Sanmei Exchange Bureau, a famous Xiamen-based enterprise specializing in overseas Chinese remittances from Southeast Asia, went bankrupt due to the prohibition of the use of "credit notes," with debts of 140,000-150,000 yuan. Every year, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia remit funds back to China, and the amount transferred through Xiamen to the hinterland of southern Fujian is the largest, reaching nearly 10 million yuan at its peak, and usually 70 to 80 million yuan. However, in recent years, due to the collapse of the world economy, the amount shrank to over 50 million yuan in the 24th year, and increased slightly in the 25th year, which is expected to reach 60 million yuan. These funds are mostly remitted back through such exchange bureaus because this is the habit of the overseas Chinese, and they can send letters and money to remote rural areas, deliver them door-to-door, and obtain receipts and return letters to reply. In recent years, postal bureaus have cracked down on carrying letters, overseas Chinese and domestic bank branches have been established one after another, and inland bank offices have gradually been established, so large remittances have mostly been diverted to banks. The business of these exchange bureaus has declined greatly. Most exchange bureaus issue their own credit notes similar to paper money to facilitate turnover. Sanmei Exchange Bureau is jointly operated by Wu Shanqian and others from Jinjiang, and has been in business for more than ten years, with considerable credit. In addition to the Xiamen headquarters, it has a branch in Quanzhou, Jinchang Exchange Bureau, and Sanmei branches in Shishi and Anhai in Nan'an. In addition to directly receiving remittances from Singapore, Penang, Yangon, Surabaya, the Philippines, and other places, it also distributes silver letters to the inland areas of Quanzhou for more than 60 exchange bureaus in Xiamen, with an annual turnover of 3 million yuan and a profit of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. It is considered one of the leading exchange bureaus in the Quanzhou area. More than ten years ago, it issued credit notes of one, five, and ten yuan in the inland areas of Quanzhou, Jinjiang, and Nan'an, and its credit was equal to that of bank banknotes. Last year, the government strictly cracked down on vouchers similar to paper money, and credit notes from various exchange bureaus were required to be withdrawn within a specified period. In mid-December, the Jinjiang and Nan'an county governments banned their circulation after the deadline had passed, and successively issued announcements. Holders of the notes rushed to the exchange bureau to redeem them. Within ten days, the inland branches of the exchange bureau were all in dire straits. At the same time, the Lunar New Year period was approaching, and Chinese and foreign banks were settling their debts. The exchange bureau could not make ends meet. The Xiamen headquarters announced its closure on the morning of December 30th. The manager Wu Shanqian and other important staff members fled first. Jinchang branch in Quanzhou and Sanmei branches in Shishi and Anhai in Nan'an also went bankrupt on the same day. In the past ten days, the silver letters remitted from Southeast Asia to the exchange bureau have been piled up and have not been distributed. The debts include more than 80,000 yuan in unrecovered credit notes, more than 20,000 yuan owed to the industry, and 40,000 to 50,000 yuan in remittances from Southeast Asia that have not been paid, with a total debt of 140,000 to 150,000 yuan. The number of creditors is only more than 20,000 yuan. The capital for its usual operations is all built on the credit notes it issued, and most of the note holders are farmers, so it has become a serious problem. (January 3rd)

### Shandong Province Plans to Establish a New-Style Cottonseed Oil Pressing Plant

Use Shandong-Produced Cottonseed to Press Oil and Manufacture Other Industrial Products

Jinan Correspondence: Although cottonseed is a by-product of cotton, it has a wide range of uses. Cottonseed linters can be used to make paper, smokeless gunpowder, adhesive tape, rayon, and artificial ivory. Cottonseed hulls can be used as feed, fertilizer, and fuel, and can also be used to make potash. After the cottonseed kernels are pressed for oil, the oilcake can be used as feed, fertilizer, and to make bread and biscuits. The cottonseed oil can be refined to make artificial lard, butter, cooking oil, winter oil, gasoline, soap, candles, and other products, with extremely wide-ranging uses. Shandong Province is a cotton-producing area, and produces approximately 3.6 million dan of cottonseed each year. Although there are occasional old-fashioned oil mills in rural areas that press oil, the production methods are crude, the oil yield is low, and there are many losses, and the oil quality is turbid, resulting in very narrow sales channels. Therefore, most of the cottonseed from the Donglin area is transported to the Tianjin Xiaqing River area via the canal. Most of the cottonseed is transported to Jinan Huangtaiqiao and sold to Japanese merchants, who transport it to Japan to press oil and manufacture various industrial products, which are then resold to our country, making huge profits. Hu Changzhun, commissioner of the Shandong branch of the National Economic Construction Movement Committee, was aware of this and specifically proposed to the conference to establish a large-scale new-style cottonseed oil pressing plant. The plant site is located near Jinan Huangtaiqiao to facilitate transportation. The entire plan for the oil pressing plant can be guided by experts from the Institute of Applied Chemistry of Nankai University in Tianjin, who will be hired to come to Shandong to plan and prepare, in order to ensure thoroughness. In the future, when the plant is completed, it will use a large amount of cottonseed from within the province to separate the short lint from the seeds and only press the kernels. The oilcake will be used as feed and fertilizer for rural areas in various counties, and the cottonseed oil can be used for cooking and as fuel for vegetable oil lamps. This will not only block leaks, but also ensure a sufficient supply of fertilizer in Shandong Province, which is a good deed to revitalize the countryside.

### Central Political School Prepares to Commemorate Xiao Nanhua

Mr. Xiao Was a Talented Student of the Central Political School: Served as Aide to Chairman Chiang for Four Years

Beijing News: Xiao Nanhua, a graduate of the Central Political School and secretary of the Aide-de-Camp Office of the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, had served as aide to Chairman Chiang for many years. In recent years, Chairman Chiang's lecture records have all been written by Mr. Xiao. He was usually responsible, loyal, and amiable in his dealings with people. During the encirclement of Huaqing Pool by rebel soldiers in Xi'an, Mr. Xiao risked his life to protect Chairman Chiang and sacrificed himself. Acquaintances and strangers alike expressed their grief. The Central Political School is now organizing the "Comrade Xiao Funeral Committee" to prepare for the funeral and commemoration. The following is an excerpt from the school's account of Mr. Xiao's deeds:

"Mr. Xiao, whose name was Nanhua and courtesy name was Jinan, was from Changsha, Hunan. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, he served as an executive member of the Changsha County Party Department, concurrently as the head of the Youth Department and the guiding committee, and concurrently as the head of the Propaganda Department. His work was very outstanding. In July of the 17th year, he was recommended by the Hunan Provincial Party Department to study in the Department of Administration of the University Department of the Central Political School. He worked hard and his studies improved. He graduated in the 21st year with excellent results, ranking third. He stayed at the school as a translator and compiler. He was loyal, capable, and made many contributions. He was also a prolific writer and could complete writing immediately. He had an extraordinary understanding and was able to capture the essence of speeches and express them in sharp and tactful words, which was highly respected by teachers and students throughout the school. In January of the 22nd year, he was ordered to serve as a stenographer in the Nanchang Camp of the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission. During the four years, he traveled with the Chairman, went to the remote areas of Sichuan and Guizhou, stepped into Ningxia, and went south to Yunnan and Guangdong, and north to Yanmen. All of the Chairman's speeches and discussions were recorded by him, accurately capturing the meaning and wording. His compilation during the training in Lushan was particularly precise and accurate. The Chairman praised him and promoted him to secretary of the Aide-de-Camp Office. Mr. Xiao was resolute in character and had a broad vision. He was amiable in his dealings with people. In recent years, he was entrusted with the responsibility of Longchoutao and gained extensive experience. His ambition became purer, and his aspirations were outstanding. He always encouraged himself to shoulder heavy responsibilities. He also liked to write poetry and express his feelings in his poems, which were poignant and fragrant, reflecting his true nature. In June of the 25th year, the political school selected him to study abroad because of his outstanding academic performance, hoping to pursue further studies. He was appreciated by the Chairman and could not bear to let him leave so quickly, so he planned to leave in February of next year. He insisted on accompanying the Chairman to Shaanxi in December, and the Xi'an Incident broke out suddenly. Mr. Xiao held a gun to defend the Chairman and sacrificed himself at the young age of twenty-eight. Alas, it was tragic. The news spread, and acquaintances and strangers alike mourned him. Mr. Xiao left behind a wife and children, which is the greatest grief in the world. Alas, with Mr. Xiao's talent, if he had lived a full life, he would have made great contributions to the country. However, he could not avoid sacrificing himself. In Mr. Xiao's case, he was ordered to sacrifice himself in times of danger, but how cruel is the world's misfortune that destroys talent. This is a record of Mr. Xiao's life to inform those at home and abroad who mourn and cherish him."

Peppermint Production Cooperation

Peppermint is a major agricultural product in this county. It is of excellent quality and has a good reputation.

Farmers' lives are becoming increasingly impoverished. The county authorities are aware of this and have formulated a plan to use the strength of the Baojia system to promote the cooperative organization of peppermint production in order to save the situation. A cooperative will be organized in every two or three Bao, and the district chief will be responsible for selecting the Baojia chief to nominate and determine the establishment of the conference by the 15th of this month.

The Suzhou-Fuyu Long-Distance Bus Company, in view of the imminent opening of the buses, believes that long-distance telephones should be installed as soon as possible. Therefore, on the morning of the 4th, representatives of the company, Liu Fuqing and Yang Shousheng, and engineer Wang Ziyun of the telephone bureau, went to Guangfu along the way to inspect. After returning to Suzhou, they immediately submitted a report to the Ministry of Transportation, requesting instructions.

### Danyang

Homicide in Trafficking Case

Yu Jin-da, a resident of the fourth household of the second Jia of the first Bao in the fifth district of the county, married Peng from Pengjia Village early in life. The couple's relationship was generally harmonious. However, Yu Pei-fu, a member of the same clan, found Peng attractive and seduced her in every possible way. Peng was eventually swayed. Unexpectedly, Pei-fu harbored evil intentions and lured Peng to Shanghai, selling her to a wealthy family. After Peng disappeared, Jin-da investigated in many ways. He learned from Qiu Geng (currently doing business in Shanghai), a villager, that Peng was in Shanghai. So, he went to Shanghai with Yun-hai, Pei-fu's brother, to find her. While traveling back to Danyang by train, about three miles east of the Lingkou station, Peng unexpectedly jumped out of the train window, instantly suffering fatal injuries. Upon hearing the news, the local district office considered it a homicide case and immediately reported it to the county government, which sent officials to examine the body. Pei-fu was arrested and interrogated. However, Qiu Geng is also highly suspected. A formal letter was sent to the Shanghai Local Court requesting the arrest of Qiu for interrogation. Yesterday, Judge Liu Cheng signed for Pei-fu to be brought to court for trial. However, Pei-fu firmly denied any involvement in Peng's trafficking. The judge then ordered that Qiu Geng be interrogated by the Shanghai court before further review.

### Qingjiang

Establishment of the Canal Lock Toll Collection Office

The Huaiyin Canal Lock was completed in June of last year and opened to navigation on July 1st. Initially, the Navigation of the Huai River Committee sent personnel to collect canal lock fees. Now, the Ministry of Finance, considering that the lock was built with funds from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity, should gradually recoup the principal and interest. It was specifically decided that starting from January 1st of the 26th year (of the Republic), the Ministry would appoint Su Nahou to the lock to collect usage fees. The toll collection office is now officially established. All previous management offices that collected fees at the lock have been closed, and all documents have been transferred to the toll collection office for management. Hereafter, any ships passing through the lock will be charged based on the product of their length and width: one yuan for those under five meters, two yuan for those under ten meters, and so on. Steamships will be charged an additional half. Public service vessels with free passes issued by the Ministry will be allowed to pass without charge.

### Yangzhou

Baojia Head Captures Stolen Goods and Thieves

Liu Yin-sheng, a resident of the ninth Jia of the eighth Bao in the Xilai Township of the ninth district of Jiangdu, came to Yangzhou on business. Unexpectedly, before dawn on New Year's Day, thieves pried open the back door of his house, moved the door panels to the back of the cowshed, blocking the way out. Liu's son, Xi-xiang, went out to relieve himself and noticed the back door was wide open. He woke the family, who discovered that nine dan and five dou of unhusked, immature rice had been stolen from the house. The next morning, the village policeman Yang Kun and others examined the scene and found scattered rice from the house to the Zongjia Village area. This was reported by the Jia head to the Bao. In the afternoon, the Bao head Wang Shi-rong and the Jia head Wang Shi-ru, along with the village policeman and Liu's son Xi-xiang, inspected each household in Zong Village. They found unhusked, immature rice in the coffin in the side room of Chen Xue-hu's house, located at the thirteenth household of the tenth Jia. In addition to the Baojia taking the rice and reporting it to the township office for district review, three days later, the victim reported the incident to the district's winter defense office, requesting the arrest of the thieves and the sealing of the stolen goods for legal prosecution.

The banks are scheduled to open today, and the trust departments of the four major banks will also open for business on the same day. Details are as follows:

Money Shops Open

The Money Shops Association notified its member money shops at the end of last year to conduct a year-end closing. All shops complied. As a result, the New Year holiday, originally two days, was extended by one day to three days. The holiday ended the day before yesterday, and all shops reopened yesterday. The association's joint reserve, market, and other operations also resumed as usual. Yesterday, the market announced that the interbank lending rate for both the morning and afternoon sessions was nine points per thousand yuan.

Sufficient Reserves

Chen Lishan has succeeded as the manager of the Money Shops Joint Reserve and took office on New Year's Day. He started working at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. There have been some changes in staff compared to last year. The deputy manager and head of safekeeping is Qian Jingqiu, the deputy manager and head of cash is Yuan Wenyi, the chairman of the committee is Shao Yanshan, the standing committee members are Qin Runqing, Liu Wuqiao, Pei Yunqing, and Wang Huailian, and the inspection committee members are Qian Yuansheng, Yu Zuoting, and Fu Shenggui. According to Chen, since the establishment of the reserve in 1932, there have been 45 member money shops, with a total reserve of approximately three million national currency and a total lending volume of approximately thirty million national currency.

New Accounting System

The Money Shops Association announced that a new accounting system will be adopted starting this year, and all shops will comply starting yesterday. The main ledger names are as follows: Journal (formerly "Daily Flow," "Cash Flow," "Rolling Balance," "Summary," etc.), General Ledger (formerly "Clear Book," "Transcript," etc.), which will be set up according to the applied accounting subjects and marked with the subject belonging to the ledger. For example, "Source of Wealth" is renamed "Capital," and capital is a part of the general ledger. Combining all general ledgers forms an accounting organization that can be cross-referenced with the journal. "Keeping Faith" is renamed "Demand Deposits," "Profits Belonging" is renamed "Term Loans," and "Wan Shang" is classified into "Accounts Receivable/Payable," "Interbank Accounts," "Interbank Accounts in Other Cities," etc., according to its nature. "Various Banks" are classified into "Interbank Accounts," "Received Exchange Coupons," etc., and "Miscellaneous Items" are classified into the applied subjects according to their nature. "Returning the Pearl to He Pu" is classified into accounts receivable. In addition, any occurrence or increase/decrease in debt claims, debts, losses, and profits should be recorded in the journal and transferred to the general ledger. In other words, each subject has a general ledger (one or several).

Bank Development

Banks took a total of four days off for the New Year and Sundays and will open for business today. According to investigations, there are new establishments to expand operations, including the Trust Department of the Four Banks and the Trust Department of Jiangsu Bank. Expanded establishments include the Ximen Branch, Nanjing Road Branch of the Four Ming Bank, and the Avenue Joffre Branch of the Asia Bank, all of which open today. The Tongyuan Bank, originally on Tianjin Road, has now moved to its new location at the corner of Beijing Road and Henan Road.

Considerable Profits

A reporter from the New Sound News Agency also inquired with banking circles about the business conditions of various banks in 1936. Due to the implementation of the new currency system, the bumper harvest in rural areas, and the revitalization of various industries, banks had very few bad debts, and each bank still had considerable profits. The Banking Association will compile and publish these figures within three or four days. As for the profits of the Central, China, and Communications Banks, the amount is very large, especially the Central Bank, which is estimated to exceed ten million yuan.

Deng Gang, the Director of the Guangdong Pacification Headquarters and the Fourth Route Army Office in Nanjing, left Nanjing on the 11:00 PM express train the night before last and arrived in Shanghai at 7:00 AM yesterday. According to Deng, speaking to the New News Agency reporter, Li Xuhuan, the Director of the Political Training Department of the Fourth Route Army, came to Shanghai after visiting Chairman Chiang and is scheduled to return to Guangdong tomorrow (the 5th) on the Italian mail ship Conte Verde.

### President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke Discusses the Third Plenary Session and the Current Situation

A reporter from the New Sound News Agency interviewed Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, yesterday morning. According to his remarks: 1. The Third Plenary Session is being convened because more than half a year has passed since the Second Plenary Session was held in July last year. According to regulations, the Third Plenary Session should be convened. At the same time, since the Xi'an Incident, there are some major national affairs that need to be discussed. 2. Chairman Chiang resigned twice but was earnestly persuaded to stay and given a month's leave. His resignation has been withdrawn. 3. Zou Haibin has no other tasks for this trip north. Zou is a member of the Central Standing Committee and should be working in Nanjing. 4. The bandit and puppet troops on the Suiyuan front are now very quiet after their disastrous defeat. The situation in North China is also relatively peaceful. 5. The resolution of the Chengdu and Beihai cases is satisfactory. As for the Japanese propaganda that they will continue to negotiate the so-called Shanghai and Hankou cases, the locations of these two cases are in the concessions and cannot be reached by our national police, so they cannot be compared with the Chengdu and Beihai cases. Whether the negotiations on the so-called adjustment of diplomatic relations can break the stalemate and continue depends entirely on whether the Japanese side can change its attitude.

### The Forked Road and True Path of National Salvation and Nation Building

— Speech by Wu Tiecheng

Address at the National Shanghai College of Commerce Celebration of Chairman Chiang's Return to Nanjing

Gentlemen and students, today your esteemed college is holding a celebration for Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing. I am very excited to have this opportunity to meet with you and express my feelings. I returned from Nanjing the day before yesterday. My trip to Nanjing was to represent the 3.5 million citizens of Shanghai in expressing our respect and concern for Chairman Chiang's safe return to Nanjing. I saw that his spirit was as strong as ever, although his back was slightly sore and only needed a short period of rest. This can reassure you all. At the same time, the Chairman expressed his gratitude for the warm concern of all sectors of the city, and specially instructed me to convey his greetings.

This time, our leader's ordeal was a major event for the Party and the country. No matter what country, what nation, or what era, there is a need for a leader. However, the emergence of a leader is not an accidental event, nor is it an easy one. A leader's success cannot be achieved by a few people; it must be supported by the people of the whole country. And the support of the people of the whole country is not something that can be obtained by chance. It requires the leader to have put in long-term effort and struggle. Only when the people of the whole country unanimously support a leader can that leader become a leader, and only then can that leader lead the people of the whole country to carry out the work of nation-building and national salvation. If a leader whom we have taken decades to create is kidnapped, endangering his life, and causing the people of the whole country to lose a central point of leadership, the result may be the collapse of the country into a miserable state. Moreover, in today's severe national crisis, such an extraordinary event will especially endanger our country's life. Fortunately, the people of the whole country were able to remain calm and composed during the period of the leader's ordeal. The order in all parts of the country remained stable as usual, and the political economy did not fluctuate, so that our foreign insults were not aggravated. This is truly a blessing in disguise. What is the reason for this? I reported to Chairman Chiang the day before yesterday that since the death of the Premier, Chairman Chiang has led the compatriots of the whole country in striving and working hard for more than ten years. But until now, we have not had an opportunity to conduct an overall test to see to what extent our national strength has been strengthened, and how deep the foundation of our nation has been established. But this time, we finally had an opportunity to conduct a general test. This time, during the period of our leader's ordeal, the people of our whole country were so grief-stricken and indignant, and yet in the midst of grief and indignation, they were still able to remain calm and composed, and were able to express a solemn attitude, so that the public security of all places was not affected in the slightest, our political economy did not waver, and our social life did not have a major impact. In particular, our foreign troubles were not aggravated. This is the overall manifestation of the progress of our entire country. I have reported this to Chairman Chiang. This can not only comfort Chairman Chiang for the mental shock he suffered during his ordeal of more than ten days, but it can also comfort the spirit of the Premier in heaven. Although there are historical records of the people warmly loving their national leaders and national heroes, they were all written by historians afterwards, using their writing to exaggerate, or not entirely consistent with the facts at the time. This time, Chairman Chiang was in danger in Xi'an, and the people of the whole country were unanimously worried and indignant. When Chairman Chiang safely returned, the people of the whole country were unanimously ecstatic. This is a living, true history. I think that future historians, no matter how vivid and powerful their writing is, will probably find it difficult to describe it as passionately and greatly as it was expressed in reality.

Why did the people of the whole country have such a warm expression this time? This is because the people of the whole country have now unanimously recognized that to build a new China and to save China, there must be a leader. If there is no leader, the whole country will be a heap of loose sand, and there will be no way to unite. The people of the whole country will have no way to contribute their strength, to concentrate their strength, so that our leader can use all the strength of the country to build the country and save the country. Today, the people of the whole country have this understanding, so the moment they heard that our leader was in trouble, everyone was unanimously worried and indignant. The moment they heard that our leader was out of danger, everyone was unanimously ecstatic. This is a natural result. When the Xi'an Incident first occurred, it was very serious. However, in less than two weeks, this serious situation took a sharp turn for the worse. There are probably four reasons for this. First, of course, it was the appeal of our leader's great personality and his sincere patriotism. Second, the civil and military officials throughout the country, under the leadership of the central government, were able to fulfill their responsibilities to the country, the people, the government, and the leader. Third, our armed comrades throughout the country expressed their loyalty and courage with a solemn attitude. Fourth, is the power of the people. And among these four major reasons, in addition to our leader's great personality and patriotic leadership, the power of the people is particularly important. This expression of power is unprecedented in China, and there is no precedent in history. This is the greatest force. This force caused the Xi'an Incident to take a sharp turn for the worse. This force caused them to submit to public opinion and not dare to harm our leader. This force enabled our leader to safely escape danger and return to Nanjing. This force prevented foreign troubles from being aggravated. This force prevented the life of the Republic of China from being interrupted. This force made the people of the whole country recognize and believe in the Kuomintang and the Three Principles of the People even more. Due to this general test, our belief in national rejuvenation has been increased. Due to this general test, we can further foresee the bright future of our country and nation. This is a blessing in disguise in this Xi'an Incident. This can be used to comfort our Premier in heaven and our leader, and it can also enable the people of the whole country to have infinite hope for the future of the country and nation.

However, learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones. Tragic events often give us valuable lessons. After this incident, we should deeply realize the true path to saving the country in the future, and we should thoroughly correct the various naive and erroneous, seemingly right but actually wrong, theories of national salvation that are currently popular.

First, now is not an era of empty talk about saving the country, but an era of saving the country with strength. The cause of saving the country is a long and arduous task. We must be down-to-earth, work hard, and never expect to succeed through speculation and taking risks. After more than ten years of lessons and education, the people of the whole country have clearly recognized that empty talk is of no help to reality. We must save the country in reality, and we must prepare our strength to save the country, only then is there hope. Chairman Chiang has repeatedly instructed us that today's national policy is to secure the country internally and resist foreign aggression. Whether in China or abroad, ancient or modern, no country can resist foreign aggression if it is not stable and unified internally. If others come to us with an entire unified country, and we respond with a divided and fragmented country, the result will only be that we will be defeated one by one. Is this the way to save the country? Others threaten us with airplanes, cannons, and land, sea, and air forces. Can we resist them by shouting slogans without using our strength? Therefore, in the past few decades, especially in the recent ten years, our leader has led us to do practical work to save the country. What is practical work to save the country? It is to truly train the people, strengthen the people's national consciousness, and strengthen the people's organizational ability, so that the people know how to obey discipline and can unite. And these many tasks must be carried out in practice to be effective. Simply shouting slogans, pointing slogans, and marching cannot be regarded as doing everything possible to save the country. In addition to actually educating and training the people, we must also develop the country's transportation, train the country's army, and engage in material and national defense construction. In addition, such as the national mobilization plan, we must prepare everything so that the whole country can be mobilized consistently, and only then will we have the confidence to win. Therefore, saving the country is practical construction, not frivolous empty talk. Saving the country is the duty of every citizen, not the monopoly of a few people. And now, the people who advocate empty talk about saving the country use saving the country as a tool and an excuse. Not only are they unwilling to save the country in practice, but they also want to oppose the government's preparations to save the country and destroy the overall national policy. When the government corrects their mistakes in order to maintain discipline and promote the national policy, they use "the government suppresses the freedom of speech for national salvation" and other seemingly right but actually wrong words to numb the masses and incite the masses. They are anxious all day long, simply indulging in empty talk, and even using conspiracies and tricks to restrain the government and destroy the government. Such empty-headed national salvation and hypocritical national salvation will not only fail to save the country, but will also make the country more and more dangerous every day. I remember that Wu Zhihui once said a few painful words, "I am now more than seventy years old. Decades ago, during the Sino-Japanese War, I heard the cry for national salvation. But decades later, today, I still hear the people crying for national salvation. Our people have been crying for national salvation for decades, but not only have we not saved the country, but the national crisis has become more and more serious." What is the reason for this? This is because our people only know how to shout and do not know how to do. Therefore, if we are truly sincere in saving the country now, we must be down-to-earth and do it, not shout empty slogans, but bury ourselves in the preparations for national defense construction to strengthen the country's strength.

Second, some so-called literati who are unlearned, unskilled, and immature in thought, have been used by the Communist Party to advocate the slogan of "People's Front", thinking that it is the supreme theory of national salvation. They do not know that the "People's Front" is a term used by the Third International's red imperialists to change their strategy. It has another purpose. The great chaos and massacre in Spain is the evil result of this theory. May I ask if we want to be Spain II? If we believe that the People's Front can save China, then the Greater East Asiaism advocated by the Japanese can also save China. They say that we are all yellow people in Asia and should coexist and prosper together. How nice does it sound? But why do we oppose Greater East Asiaism? Because the term Greater East Asiaism is good, but their ambitions and strategies are too wrong and too dangerous. Regarding this point, the Premier gave a painful speech in Japan during his lifetime, correcting their mistakes and pointing out their correct path. Secondly, the term People's Front is not bad either, but if you look closely at its content, its conspiracy is too dangerous. I have an analogy now. Whether it is the People's Front or Greater East Asiaism, they are like sugar-coated arsenic. The outside is sweet, but the inside is poisonous. The People's Front may feel good, but if you eat it, you will die. Greater East Asiaism may sound good, but if you believe it, you will lose your country and your race. Every country has its own stand and needs. We cannot easily copy other people's theories. Chinese people should be aware of their own country's interests and should establish a consistent national policy. We cannot think that new things in Europe and the United States are all good and can be blindly followed. What's more, the "People's Front" is fundamentally not applicable. It is a strategy of the Communist Party, a term for plotting its own interests. If it has no other purpose, how can it be used as a theory of national salvation? Third, speaking of tolerating the Communists, they say that our leader wants to secure the country internally and resist foreign aggression. This is correct. But in securing the country internally and resisting foreign aggression, Chinese people should not fight Chinese people. But the Communist Party is also Chinese. When we are united against foreign aggression, we should not fight them. We should tolerate the Communists. This sounds reasonable, but although the Communist Party is Chinese, they are not commanded by Chinese people. They are listening to the orders of the Third International. The Communist Parties of other countries do not have troops and do not have conspiracies to endanger the foundation of the country. They are only engaged in legitimate activities for a political cause. But the Chinese Communist Party is driven by others, organizes troops, overthrows the government, and endangers the foundation of the country. If Chinese people are fighting Chinese people, can we let them fight without fighting back? If we are not allowed to suppress the Communists, then if the Japanese drive the puppet troops of the three northeastern provinces to fight us Chinese people in the future, then the puppet troops are also Chinese people. Can we say at that time that Chinese people should not fight Chinese people? Today, the national crisis is so serious that our entire country should naturally unite, should be unified, and should not have internal wars. "Chinese people should not fight Chinese people", but the Communist Party refuses to unite, refuses to be unified, and insists on using Chinese people to fight Chinese people. Therefore, we are not fighting Chinese people when we suppress the Red bandits. We are fighting the running dogs of red imperialists—red traitors. By the same token, we are not fighting Chinese people when we fight the puppet bandits in Suiyuan now, but are fighting the running dogs of white imperialists—white traitors. This point must be clearly distinguished. We must clearly distinguish this principle so that we will not disrupt our own front for national salvation.

In short, this Xi'an Incident gave us a major lesson: we should not indulge in empty talk, especially we should not forget our roots, and we should not lose the Chinese people's self-confidence. If the people do not have self-confidence, the country will lose the foundation for its survival, which is the most dangerous disease of the nation. The so-called "there is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart" is the principle. Now, the mentality of the general public is really very dangerous. Not only do most people not believe that Chinese principles can govern China, and do not believe that Chinese people can save China, but even those who are eager for leadership are blindly following foreigners and lack self-confidence. They dream of being Russia's Stalin or Gorky, but they do not want to learn to be China's Confucius, Wen Tianxiang, Guan Yu, Yue Fei, or Sun Yat-sen. They do not know that the emergence of a great national hero is closely related to the environment of the times, the national spirit, and social conditions. They only dream of being Russia's Stalin, and do not want to learn to be China's Sun Yat-sen or Chiang Kai-shek. They do not know that only Russia can produce Stalin, only Germany can produce Hitler, only Italy can produce Mussolini, and only China can produce Sun Yat-sen or Chiang Kai-shek. If China produces Stalin, it will not save China. If Russia produces Sun Yat-sen or Chiang Kai-shek, it will not save Russia either. Only when China produces Sun Yat-sen or Chiang Kai-shek can it save China. Chinese people are useless, they do not believe in themselves, they do not want to be China's Confucius, Guan Yu, Yue Fei, Wen Tianxiang, Sun Yat-sen, or Chiang Kai-shek, but they insist on being Russia's Stalin. If we do not correct this naive thought and this erroneous view, and if we continue in this way, our national self-confidence will soon be completely lost. Once the national self-confidence is lost, even if there is no foreign trouble, this nation will not be able to survive and become strong on its own. Once it encounters a storm, it will be uprooted. Therefore, to save China, we must restore national self-confidence. After we have first laid a solid foundation for our country, we can then accept new things from the world to build our new China. This is what our Premier has consistently taught us, and it is what our leader has repeatedly instructed us. I hope that after the lesson of this incident, the people of the whole country will use this spirit as the spirit of nation-building and national salvation. In particular, the young people who are responsible for the future task of revitalizing the nation should use this spirit to distinguish between the forked road of national salvation and nation-building and the true path of national salvation and nation-building.

### Citizens' Association Asks for Negotiations on Japanese Aircraft and Warships Invading Our Sovereignty

The General Federation is requested to forward the letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

The 7th, 12th, 16th, 27th, and 38th district branches of the Citizens' Association of the First Special District jointly sent a letter to the General Federation yesterday morning, requesting that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, strongly protesting the disturbance caused by Japanese warships along our coast. The original letter from the association is recorded as follows: "Respectfully, on the first of this month, ten Japanese warships hovered in Yanglinkou, our territorial waters, and used heavy machine guns to strafe the shore for a long time. At the same time, Japanese aircraft reappeared in Qingdao City, distributing absurd leaflets in an attempt to confuse people's minds and implement aggressive conspiracies. It is regrettable that Japanese warships and aircraft have been causing such arbitrary disturbances and malicious propaganda in our territorial waters and airspace. It is requested that your association forward this letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to seriously protest and stop this, so as to maintain the dignity of the country's territorial sovereignty. We look forward to it."

Recalling that a week ago, our country's only leader, Chairman Chiang, was in trouble in Xi'an, and was able to safely escape danger and return to Nanjing, the whole country was ecstatic to the extreme. Chairman Chiang's safe escape from danger is deeply and significantly related to the future of the country. For several years, the Chairman has brought the country's fortune closer to the path of light for the sake of the country and the people, and is not far from the road to national rejuvenation. Therefore, on this New Year's Day, the people of the whole country should continue to be determined to work hard and strive to make the country and the nation move towards the bright path of rejuvenation.

Especially in the recent ten years, there has been the disturbance of the Communist bandits and the oppression of diplomacy. The country has suffered extremely serious and unprecedented disasters. However, our country has established unprecedented miracles in this unprecedented disaster. The elimination of the Communist bandits is not a problem, and the calmness of diplomacy can be guaranteed. Moreover, the military and political affairs of the whole country are unified. What is the reason for this? This is because our leader, Chairman Chiang, with his great spirit and personality, led the military and civilians of the whole country, and with the determination of "self-reliance", stepped into the path of national rejuvenation. That is why we can have today's celebration. In today's celebration, we must not forget the past dangers, and we must think about the future dangers, which will be ten times greater than in the past. But as long as we make our greatest efforts to support our leader, and under the leader's leadership, move forward towards the revival of the nation, all dangers will not be feared. I hope that all officers will work harder and strive harder in the future." Finally, he shouted slogans: ㊀Long live the Republic of China! ㊁Long live Chairman Chiang! ㊂Long live the Chinese Kuomintang! The ceremony ended and the meeting adjourned.

### Tea Industry Inspection Group Departing for Japan Tomorrow Morning

Hong Chunzhi Discusses Purpose of Inspection; Industry Colleagues Held Farewell Banquet Last Night

The Shanghai Foreign Tea Trade Association's tea industry inspection group, consisting of seven members, is scheduled to depart for Japan tomorrow morning. Colleagues from the association held a farewell banquet last night. The following are the details as recorded by the Industrial News reporter:

Motivation for Inspection

In order to improve business, the association is not only gradually rectifying its internal affairs and planning various schemes, but is also seeking to improve the completeness of its organization, the rationalization of its management, and the improvement of transportation and manufacturing. It has specifically dispatched members Hong Chunzhi, Song Qifan, Li Naichang, Ning Weiting, Tao Zhensheng, Hu Yizhi, and Secretary Yu Gumin to form an inspection group to Japan. With the guidance of the Ministry of Industry, letters have been sent to the embassy in Japan and consulates in various parts of the country to introduce relevant tea industry organizations to facilitate inspection, so that the findings from the field can be carefully adopted in accordance with national conditions.

Statements from Group Members

According to group member Hong Chunzhi yesterday, "Our group has been entrusted by the association and guided by the Ministry of Industry to inspect the tea industry in Japan. Our country's tea industry was originally the most advanced in the world, but now it has fallen behind. For the sake of improving manufacturing, increasing production, and studying trade methods, this group was formed. Tea is our country's major export, which is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Although we are not talented or knowledgeable, we dare not undertake this mission. We will only do our best to compile a report of our findings and contribute it to the Ministry of Industry and our association for reference. Our group is organized into three sections: social affairs, documentation, and accounting. We are scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 9:00 AM on the sixth of this month, first to Kobe, then to Tokyo to the embassy, and then to various places for on-site inspections. Our association attaches great importance to inspecting tea conditions in various countries. After returning from Japan, we plan to go to Java, India, Ceylon, and other places."

Welcome from Colleagues

Fourteen tea companies including Yuan Fengrun, Tongtai, Xietai, and Xielong, as well as tea industry associations from Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and other provinces, held a farewell banquet at the Xinxin Restaurant on Nanjing Road at 6:00 PM yesterday, as the group's departure date was approaching. In addition to all the members of the group, all the members of the Foreign Tea Trade Association and representatives from various places were present, and the conversations were very congenial. The gathering ended at about 10:00 PM.

### Consul-General of Nicaragua in Shanghai, Lin Renzhou, Returned to China Yesterday

Going to Nanjing Today to Report for Duty; Discussing Situation of Overseas Chinese in Nicaragua

Lin Renzhou, Secretary of the Embassy in Panama and concurrently Consul-General of Nicaragua, returned to China on leave and arrived in Shanghai at 5:00 PM yesterday aboard the Changxing Company's Empress of Russia. Zhang Mengling, a representative from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, welcomed him. According to Lin, while on the ship, he told a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, "I have been away from my motherland for eight years. This time, I have requested leave to return home due to illness and to report on the situation of the embassy and consulates. There are approximately 4,000 overseas Chinese in Panama and just under 1,000 in Nicaragua, mostly engaged in commerce, dealing in food and silk products. The situation has always been very good. In recent years, due to the global economic downturn, the overseas Chinese in Panama and Nicaragua have not been spared. At the same time, nationalism has developed, and many countries have a tendency to exclude foreigners. In July last year, Nicaragua planned to promulgate a law restricting the business of overseas Chinese. If implemented, our overseas Chinese would inevitably be disturbed. After my best efforts in negotiations, fortunately, the country took into account diplomatic relations and ultimately abandoned the previous proposal." Lin plans to go to Nanjing today to meet with Foreign Minister Zhang Qun and report everything.

### National Goods Factory Joint Competition Postponed to Ninth

### Pawnshops Requesting Another Two-Year Extension of License Fee Reduction

This period has now expired, but business remains sluggish. Therefore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been requested to forward a request to the Social Affairs and Finance Bureaus to extend the said measure for another two years, in order to show consideration for the difficulties of businesses.

A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency specifically visited him at his residence yesterday. According to him, he is not carrying any mission on this trip. He will go to Nanjing tomorrow (i.e., today) to visit old friends, such as Foreign Minister Zhang Qun, with whom he has had many years of acquaintance. He will stay in Nanjing for about four or five days and then return to Shanghai. Later, when the reporter asked for his opinion on Sino-Japanese relations, he said that for the sake of East Asian security, both sides should take "emotion" as the core in order to achieve true friendship.

### Elderly Man Who Jumped into River Rescued, Died of Old Age and Illness

Guo Qin Gong, an elderly man of sixty-eight years of age from Beisha, Chongming, came to Shanghai in a fit of pique due to a quarrel with his family at home around the 20th of December of last year. He went to barbershops along Xujiahui Road in the French Concession to look for his son, who was a barber. However, he could not find his son's whereabouts. The elderly man stayed in Shanghai for about a week, and the money he had brought ran out. Unable to return home and suffering from hunger and cold, he had the idea of ending his life. On the night of the 29th, at about 8:00 PM, he jumped into the Huangpu River from the Jinliyuan Wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in the French Concession. In the darkness, people nearby only heard a splash. Boatman Xu Jin rescued Guo and notified Police Station No. 176, who took Guo to the Xiaodongmen police station for questioning. He was still able to confess that he had come to Shanghai to look for his son but had been unable to find him and had jumped into the river. Taking pity on him, the officer took clothes and had him change and sent him to Guangci Hospital. However, Guo was old and weak, and his condition deteriorated, so he died at 11:00 PM on New Year's Eve. The hospital notified the police station, who sent the body to the Tongren Yuanyuan Branch Funeral Home for an autopsy. Due to the New Year holiday, the autopsy was reported to the Second Special Court yesterday, and Prosecutor Wang Ren and forensic doctors examined the body. As there was no way to identify the relatives of the deceased, the authorities ordered the body to be buried by the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Funeral Home for relatives to claim later.

### Secretary of the "Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors" Group, Wang Zixiang, Convicted

Sentenced to a Fine of Three Hundred Yuan

Wang Zixiang, from Hangzhou, was sentenced for participating as secretary in the "Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors" group organized by Zhang Zilian and others.

### Chen Qiucao's Painting Exhibition for Suiyuan Relief

A painting exhibition for Suiyuan relief by the famous painter Chen Qiucao began on the second at the Da Hsin Company on Nanjing Road. As it was during the New Year holidays, many Chinese and Western people visited. Over a hundred paintings were displayed, including ink paintings, oil paintings, and various designs, all expertly arranged. Many works are commendable, such as the oil painting "The Eve Before the Explosion," which symbolizes the impending crisis of the times with an erupting volcano, and "Men and Women Raising Glasses in Revelry," which implies the decadence of the national spirit, as well as "On the National Salvation Line," which depicts the heroic struggles of front-line soldiers for the country and the dynamic movements of people from all walks of life towards them, showing profoundness and truly being a great structure. The ink paintings have a unique style, taking the meaning of the pens of predecessors, writing the theme of reality, and incorporating satire, washing away the current decadent style. Chen, in view of the need for aid in the Suiyuan war, has set aside half of the proceeds from ticket sales and sales of works for donations. Admission tickets cost one jiao, and the tickets are retained with a stub to show sincerity. The exhibition will last until the tenth, and it is necessary for Chinese people who love art and sympathize with the Suiyuan relief effort to see it.

### Woman's Abortion Prosecuted by Police Station

Zhu Xinyuan, a local woman, is 22 years old and unmarried and lives with her mother at 15 Shanhai Pass Road. Zhu, however, has opened her heart and is not accustomed to living in the inner quarters of the house, so she secretly had an affair with someone and often went out on the pretext of meeting him and had clandestine meetings, which resulted in pregnancy. Zhu was deeply afraid that her abdomen would swell and be noticed by her mother, as it was a matter of face. She discussed having an abortion with her little sister Tan Caidi, who introduced her to Yang Zhong, a woman from Zhenjiang, at 215 Changping Road. The fee for the operation was set at twenty-one yuan. Yang Zhong performed the abortion in November of last year. On November 14, the fetus was aborted, but Zhu's lower body bled continuously, and she stayed in bed, but she still endured and did not dare to speak out. It was not until the third of this month that Zhu's mother noticed that Zhu's illness was getting worse and immediately sent her to Guangren Hospital for treatment. The hospital reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, which sent Detective Cui Jinchuan to investigate. The investigation was confirmed to be true, and Yang Zhong was arrested, taken to the hospital, and identified by Zhu Xinyuan without error. She was detained in the police station. Yesterday morning, she was sent to Criminal Court No. 8 of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted Yang Zhong in accordance with Article 290 of the Criminal Code, and prosecuted Zhu Xinyuan in accordance with Article 288 of the Criminal Code, and stated the above situation, saying that Zhu Xinzhuan is currently being treated in the hospital and requested permission to extend the time. When questioned, Yang Zhong claimed, "I returned to Jiangbei on May 6 of the lunar calendar this year because my aunt died, and I did not return to Shanghai until October. Therefore, I do not know about the abortion and have been falsely accused by Zhu Xinyuan." Judge Huang Risheng ruled that she should be remanded in custody and wait for the rehearing on the 13th.

### Firecracker Explosion

Police Officer and Apprentice Injured

At 8:30 AM yesterday, at the South Railway Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, the Zhengyi Transportation Company was transporting two boxes of New Year's firecrackers on behalf of a customer for collection by the Dalai Company in Hangzhou. When the boxes were being loaded onto the freight platform at the South Station's export warehouse in preparation for weighing, one of the boxes suddenly exploded, causing a huge bang that shocked nearby merchants and residents, who gathered to watch. Yang Songlin, a 27-year-old police officer from Songjiang who was on duty at the station, was injured in the head, face, eyes, and legs. At the same time, a Li surname apprentice from the Tonghe Transportation Company was injured in the face and feet and other places. His injuries were light and he bandaged himself and returned to the store. Yang was sent to the Medical Department of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Section Police Department for treatment. The police took the firecracker escort, Chen Zhongyuan, from the freight transport company to the police section and ordered the person in charge to inquire and verify the situation.

### Cao Zhongfu Induces a Friend's Wife

Ding Shanming Files a Lawsuit, Seeking Over 4,000 Yuan in Damages

Ding Shanming, a local resident of this county, is 28 years old and works in the rice business. On March 11th of the 16th year of the Republic of China, he married Gu Cuizhen (currently 29 years old), the beautiful daughter of Mr. Gu, a prominent figure from Hongqiao, Xujiahui, through a matchmaker. They resided at No. 137 Hongqiao Town. They've been married for almost ten years, and the relationship between husband and wife has been relatively harmonious. Unexpectedly, last summer, Ding Shanming received an anonymous letter from the outside, accusing his wife of improper conduct. Ding dismissed it because there was no evidence and fearing it was a divisive scheme. Therefore he ignored it, only paying secret attention to investigation. Recently Ding discovered that his wife really had breached marital fidelity and was having an affair with Cao Zhongfu, a local real estate businessman residing at No. 45 Yidingpan Road. They also met secretly at No. 7 Pu'ai Fang, Guangdong Road. Therefore, on December 30th of last year, he reported the information to the Laozha Police Station, who dispatched Chinese detective Ye Yusi to investigate, but they were gone. Early the next morning, around 8 a.m., Ding learned that his wife, Gu Cuizhen, and Cao Zhongfu were together in Room 374 of the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road, registered under the surname Lü. He reported to the police station again, and detective Ye went to arrest Cao Zhongfu, Ding Gu (i.e., Cuizhen) together. They were taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted according to Article 239 of the Criminal Code, for the crime of adultery, and stated the case, saying that when arresting the two defendants in Room 374 of the Oriental Hotel, a licensed pistol and 53 small pieces of opium were found in the drawer. Therefore, the police also prosecuted under Article 16 of the Anti-Opium Law. Then, the plaintiff Ding Shanming testified that he had been married to Gu for nine years. The defendant Cao Zhongfu was my friend. I met him several times at my father-in-law's house. I did not know that he was a beast in human clothing and seduced my wife. I should ask for an inquiry and also hire lawyer Gong Wenhuan to the court to file a civil suit, requesting over 4,000 yuan in damages. When questioned, Cao Zhongfu confessed to being in a relationship with Ding Gu, but did not know that she had a husband. Ding Gu claimed that she married Ding Shanming at the age of twenty. Two years later, her husband had an affair outside and drove her away, so she privately cohabitated with Cao. Judge Dai verified the confessions and ordered the two defendants to be detained for a further hearing next Friday.

### Yu Zongying Discusses This Year's Cement Production

The Shangban Jiangnan Cement Company has raised 2.4 million yuan and built a factory near Qixia Mountain in the capital suburbs, equipped with the latest machinery to manufacture cement. The annual output is 600,000 barrels. It is planned to start production and delivery in the spring of this year. Yu Zongying, the director of preparation of the company, recently came to Shanghai. According to him, in order to expand production, reduce costs, and strive to meet the principles of modern industrial economics, the company is expanding the current kiln and grinding equipment of the Jiangnan factory to increase production, so as to meet the needs of domestic construction. In addition, the Central Fifth Plenary Session last year resolved to develop various heavy industries in China. The Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Railways are currently planning construction separately. The domestic cement industry will become increasingly important. In view of this, the company plans to raise an additional 1.6 million yuan from existing shareholders, with a total capital of 4 million yuan, increasing the annual output by 800,000 barrels, for a total of 1.4 million barrels. According to statistics, the total annual production of cement by various cement companies in China is currently about 4.45 million barrels. After the company's machinery is installed and completed this spring, it can increase production by 2.4 million barrels, which is about 32 percent of the current total amount. The number is quite large. In addition, the China Cement Company in Longtan is also increasing new machinery, which can increase annual production by about 500,000 barrels. The total output of the country will increase to 6.3 million barrels. Judging from the sales volume of the national market in recent years, the supply is already more than demand. In other words, there is a risk of overproduction. The Jiangnan company plans to adopt a method of controlling production while increasing production on the one hand. It plans to start production by first opening half of the machines to produce only half of the amount, and then gradually increase the production amount while observing the needs of all parties and the sales situation in the market, so as to maintain the balance of cement production and sales in the country and avoid the problem of excess or shortage.

### Pigeon-Raising Comrades Organize Shanghai Homing Pigeon Association

Although the Shanghai Homing Pigeon Research Association has already been established by homing pigeon comrades in Shanghai, homing pigeon comrades from Songjiang and Qingpu have been requesting to join, but the association cannot accommodate them due to its charter. Therefore, Director Shen of the Shanghai Zoo and others have requested the Nanjing China Homing Pigeon Association to allow the establishment of a branch of the China Homing Pigeon Association in Shanghai, in order to accommodate comrades in Shanghai and nearby areas to join together, to increase interest and promote emotional connection. It is learned that the General Association has approved the request. The charter of the branch is currently being drafted. Once it is announced and implemented, the Shanghai branch can be organized and established in accordance with the charter.

### The Non-Redemption Group of Rickshaws Petitions to Temporarily Maintain the Status Quo

And Quickly Plan Emergency Measures

The Rickshaw Industry Association of this city believes that the non-redemption group of rickshaws run by the North and South City Rickshaw Merchants has been quite successful, and both rickshaw merchants and rickshaw pullers have benefited a lot. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities plans to transfer it to an insurance company to handle. Before the procedures have been completed, the police station issued a letter to take action against the magnetic chapters of the non-redemption group, causing panic in the rickshaw industry and increasing the number of rickshaw theft cases. A special request is made to the Bureau of Public Utilities to temporarily maintain the status quo before the aftermath measures are formulated. The petition is copied as follows: "We received a directive from your bureau No. 1900, stating that the submission has been fully understood. After convening the relevant bureaus to discuss, it was found that the proposed method is prone to abuses and should be rejected. The request should not be discussed. All non-redemption group number plates nailed to the rickshaws should be removed. Please comply with the above requirements." Upon receipt of this directive, it should be complied with without further delay. However, rickshaw theft and extortion have been going on for many years. The accidental losses suffered by the poor laborers and rickshaw merchants are not small. After the establishment of the association, it was recognized as the greatest hidden danger for rickshaw pullers and rickshaw merchants. After repeated efforts to eliminate it, the non-redemption group was organized in May last year to make passive resistance. Because the special zone of Shanghai West failed to follow suit, rickshaw thieves are still active everywhere. In the past, some people were extorted, but now they are peeling off the rubber and abandoning it in remote alleys. Although rickshaw pullers and rickshaw merchants are still inevitably suffering losses, it is a world of difference from the situation in the past where there was no scruples in stealing rickshaws for redemption. The association is leading the way to reduce and eliminate theft. Suddenly, a directive was issued, which is shocking. The aftermath of the abolition of this non-redemption group should be properly addressed. It is requested that your bureau continue to consider the best interests of the rickshaw industry in the past and quickly plan remedial measures, so that rickshaw thieves cannot be revived, and the rickshaw industry can enjoy the practical benefits of comprehensive planning. The association will do its best to follow. Therefore, before the aftermath measures are determined, it is intended to request that the status quo be maintained to show consideration and maintain commercial transportation.

### Donggou Merchants and Residents Request to Move Oil Pools

In Donggou Town, Pudong, this city, the Meiguang Company previously set up two oil pools in the town, which aroused opposition from local merchants and residents, who petitioned the authorities to stop them. Currently, local merchants and residents Yang Lizhen, Ding Kungeng, Zhuang Linxun, Xu Jingshan, etc., are increasingly panicked because they have not seen the authorities approve the request to stop them. Therefore, yesterday, they gathered many local merchants and residents. At the meeting, they all agreed that the Huaxing Wharf in the town is not allowed to store oil. This has been finalized since the 16th year of the Republic of China. Along the Yangtze River in Pudong, foreign oil pools are lined up. The municipal government has also ordered them to move out within a time limit, which is approaching. The people of Pudong are fortunate to have a chance to stand up. At this time, if domestic businessmen are allowed to set up oil pools in undesignated areas, it will give others an excuse. The authorities' hard-won decisions in the past will inevitably be affected. This matter is related to the safety of the entire Pudong area, violates the municipal government's decisions, and involves diplomatic issues. Therefore, it is requested that the relevant agencies of this city and the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association, etc., petition the authorities about the above situation and immediately demolish the company's dangerous buildings to maintain the safety of the town's residents.

### Posing as Westerners to Do Evil Posing as Westerners to Do Evil

Liu Yingcai and Accomplices Planned to be Arrested, Police Request Postponement of Investigation and Further Interrogation

Liu Yingcai, a native of Shandong, is 25 years old and lives at No. 1291 Lafayette Road, French Concession. His father works in the Customs. In his early years, he married a Russian woman. Liu Yingcai and his five siblings, two younger sisters who are currently working as dancers. Yingcai also worked in the Customs, but was dismissed due to an incident, resulting in unemployment and drifting into the gang. Because Yingcai looks very similar to a Westerner, he took the opportunity to habitually impersonate a Western detective to extort and squeeze money. On December 26th of last year, Liu Yingcai himself impersonated a Western detective and colluded with six accomplices. Around 2:00 AM, they carried pistols, flashlights, and other items to the home of Wang Yushan, a fellow villager who made a living setting up a small book stall at No. 3 Renshoufang, Beidise Road. On the pretext of searching for drugs and heroin, they ransacked the house and robbed 37 yuan in banknotes and 12 jiao in small bills and then escaped to divide the spoils. Liu and others thought that the opportunity was good. On the 28th, they gathered their gang again to the home of Hu Ruixiang, a coppersmith working upstairs in a headhunter shop at No. 105 Gansi East Road, and used the same tactics to try to search and rob. Hu saw through their deception and shouted "Thieves!" Liu and others, feeling guilty, immediately turned around and ran outside. Hu followed Liu closely behind and followed him to the entrance of Lane 1222 Lafayette Road, where he grabbed Liu. Liu struggled to break free. Hu immediately went to the police station to report. Later, the detectives followed Hu to his home to investigate. Unexpectedly, they met Liu face-to-face at the Qianjiatang intersection of Lafayette Road. At this time, Liu had changed into Chinese clothes. Hu identified his face and reported to the detectives, who arrested him at the police station. According to Liu's confession, he admitted to impersonating a detective and robbing, and led the detectives to the Qianjiatang intersection of Lafayette Road and No. 3 Gongxingli, Huanlong Road, where accomplices Qu Shouyi and Zhang Baoxi were arrested one after another. Two others, Hu Lao Er and Hu Lao San, escaped and have not been apprehended. The detectives took the bandits Liu, Qu, and Zhang back to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. Judge Sun Peng interrogated them. Police attorney Chen Ming stated the case and requested a postponement of the investigation before filing a lawsuit. Hu Ruixiang then recounted the incident of the defendants impersonating detectives and attempting to rob. The court verified the report and briefly interrogated the defendants before ordering a further hearing on the 11th. The defendants were returned to custody.

### Private Possession of Firearms Case Transferred to Local Court

Prosecuted by Prosecutor After Investigation

The Songhu Garrison Headquarters received a secret report that Yang Xinfa's home in Chenhang Township, Baoshan County, contained a large number of firearms, planning to commit wrongdoing. They immediately ordered the investigation team and military police to rush to the scene. First, they forbade all persons in the house from moving, and then searched the house. A machine gun was found, but the other parts were incomplete, as well as three rifles, one pistol, and two hundred bullets. Due to the seriousness of the matter, in addition to arresting Yang Xinfa, Wang Guanqing, Wang Weiguo, Zhu Fulin, Zhu Chengliang, Shen Yuqing, Si Yunsheng, Mo Songlin, and others who remained inside were also arrested on suspicion and escorted to the headquarters. They were sent to the military law office for investigation. Yang Xinfa claimed that the firearms were collected during the January 28th Incident and there was no intention of committing crimes. After a thorough investigation by the headquarters, there was no crime of disturbing social order, affecting military affairs, or treason against the country. However, without approval, the private possession of a large number of guns and cannons is also an unforgivable crime and should be dealt with in accordance with ordinary criminal law. Therefore, yesterday, a document was prepared and the police were sent to transfer the group of criminals, along with the guns and bullets, to the local court for interrogation. The suspects were all taken into custody after being questioned by Prosecutor Tang, awaiting the filing of a public prosecution.

### The Case of a Guanghua Student Crushed to Death by a Car Responsibility Awaits Investigation

Huang Yinhua Drove Without a License, Tang Chuzhao Substituted Responsibility, Court Ordered Detention for Further Interrogation

Yang Zukang, an employee of the Engineering Department of the Public Works Bureau, lives at No. 27 Wujiajiao, Fahua Town. He usually owns car No. 8751 for transportation. Recently, the car was damaged, so he entrusted the Donghua Car Repair Shop at No. 1926 Jing'an Temple Road to repair it. The repair was completed on the last day of last year, and at 4:40 p.m., the shop ordered Huang Yinhua, a coppersmith from Ningbo, to drive the car to Yang's house. Because Huang did not have a driver's license, his car technology was slightly inferior. When the car passed the intersection of Anhe Temple Road and Kaixuan Road, because a Westerner was driving a car in front, Huang planned to overtake the car, causing him to accidentally hit Su Qinglian, a student of the Guanghua University Department, and Ye Xinzhi, a student of the Guanghua Middle School, both from Fujian. Huang saw that he had caused trouble and abandoned the car and fled. The Jing'an Temple Police Station received the report and immediately ordered Chinese detective Lu Lianbao to investigate and send the injured to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Su died of a brain injury, and Ye suffered a fractured left thigh, broken scalp, and broken right hand. While investigating, Tang Chuzhao (holding a driver's license), another coppersmith from Ningbo, suddenly surrendered to the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau, claiming that he was the driver at the time. The Public Security Bureau notified the police station, and Tang accompanied them to the scene of the accident to demonstrate the situation. Not long after, Huang Yinhua also surrendered to the police station, saying that because he did not have a driver's license, the responsibility was greater, so the shop owner ordered Tang to take the blame. Now that he heard that one person had died, he knew that taking the blame would not solve the problem, so he surrendered to the police station. Tang and Huang were detained together and sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday. Police attorney Li Zhishan stated the process. The responsibility for this matter still needs to be investigated in detail, so he requested permission to detain them. He Qianping, the Dean of Guanghua University, testified that the deceased and the injured were Guanghua students and that Su Qinglian's father's name was Su Zhongfang, who runs the Fuheshun Factory in Fujian. After Judge Huang Risheng questioned the two defendants, Tang and Huang, he ordered them to be returned to custody for a further hearing.

It is learned that Chen Li was arrested and detained by detectives the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police attorney Zhang Shizhu stated the case and requested a postponement. Judge Pan ordered Chen Li to be detained for a further hearing on the 7th.

### Husband's Affair, Wife Rushes to Catch Adultery

Weng Acai (Yang Weng, 25 years old), a young woman from Xinzhuang, looks quite beautiful. She is currently running a teahouse on the main street of Longhua Town, Shanghai West. Her husband, Yang Yuexing, used to be a member of the security corps. He was sentenced to five years in prison for shooting a Mr. Gu. Unexpectedly, Acai, being young and romantic, was not accustomed to sleeping alone. At first, she had an affair with Pan Jinxiang, a member of the security corps, and then had a relationship with Gu Amei (28 years old, living at No. 13 Gujia Shed), of the Shengsheng Milk Shed, which led to widespread scandals. The nearby people all knew, calling it "three-fresh soup". Recently, they have become more blatant, like a married couple. Gu's wife, Zhu, found out and went to catch the adultery the night before last with her aunt, Gu Wu, and others, and took the clothes of the man and woman home and hid them. Later, they quarreled on Caoxi Road and were heard by the police officer Qu Binghe, who temporarily detained them. After the director Luo questioned them separately yesterday, he believed that the case was related to disrupting the family and having an affair with a married woman. Except for Gu Wu, who was temporarily released on bail, the others were sent to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for interrogation.

The Pudong District Fire Brigade was alerted and rushed to the scene to put out the fire. Subsequently, the Laobaidu and Yangjing districts also dispatched fire engines to assist. Due to the rapid spread of the fire and the difficulty in extinguishing the burning firewood piles, it was not until dawn that the fire was completely extinguished.

The investigation revealed that the defendant was a fugitive who had been operating an opium den called "Swallow's Nest" in Sanguantang Lane, Hongkou, since September of last year. The police added this charge to the indictment. Deng confessed that the handgun was given to him by a friend named Xiao Fujian to be taken to Zhabei and sold to a rickshaw puller named Asan for ten yuan.

### Fishing Boat Damaged by Fishing Vessel

Captain Kong Achang of Fishing Vessel Threatens Fishing Boat Owner

Wang Ayuan and Crew Desperately Cry for Help

The Jinhexing junk from Ningbo, loaded with cow bones from Zhenjiang, was scheduled to be unloaded in Ningbo. It arrived in Shanghai on December 28th of last year, underwent customs inspection, and was anchored off the beach opposite Baotaiwan in Pudong because of strong south winds. While awaiting a moderation in the wind speed, the Guangyu No. 6 fishing vessel was leaving port at 7:00 PM on the 30th when it carelessly damaged half of the fishing boat's bow. The fishing boat owner, Wang Ayuan, and one of his crew members jumped onto the fishing vessel while the fishing vessel continued to exit port, attempting to escape instead of stopping after causing the damage. Wang Ayuan and his crew member remonstrated with the captain, Kong Achang (32 years old, from Dinghai). They argued that since he had damaged their boat, he should stop to assess the damage before continuing. Kong Achang not only ignored them but also threatened Wang and his crew in a high voice, "Don't shout! If you don't listen to me, I'll throw you into the Huangpu River or have the [unclear nationality, possibly the Japanese, as the vessel was jointly owned by Chinese and Japanese merchants] beat you to death!" In desperation, Wang Ayuan and his crew cried for help. A patrol boat from the Zhanghuabang Customs Water Police Station heard the cries and arrived on the scene. After learning what had happened, they rescued the two men, arrested Kong Achang, and sent him to the Fourth Division of the Public Security Bureau's Water Police for interrogation. The division dispatched officers to escort Kong to the Shanghai Local Court for trial. Wang Ayuan, the fishing boat owner, incurred significant losses due to the damage to his boat and the cost of repairs and food. He requested the Xiasenji Customs Brokerage to submit a report to the Zhanghuabang Customs Docking Office and the Navigation Administration to negotiate compensation for the damages from the fishing vessel.

### Twelve Suspects Arrested in the Jingyun Building Robbery Case

Remanded to Court for Trial Yesterday; Two-Week Extension Granted

The Jingde Accounting Office in Room 508 of Jingyun Building, No. 378 Beijing Road, was broken into and robbed of approximately 5,000 yuan in legal tender at 11:30 AM on New Year's Eve. While the robbers were searching, Wen Akun and Wu Jinbao, tea boys from the accounting office, sneaked out to report to Western Officer Sylte, No. 268, and Watchman Pan Shoulong, No. 2128, of the General Police Department. This led to a shootout between the police and the robbers, resulting in the death of robber Wang Bingsheng and the capture of Wang Jinsheng, a robber from Yangzhou. A handgun and a Mauser pistol were seized, and 1,400 yuan in stolen money was recovered. Western Officer Sylte and Watchman Pan Shoulong were killed by bullets while bravely apprehending the robbers. The General Police Department, after capturing robber Wang Jinsheng, interrogated him thoroughly, leading him to name many accomplices. Chinese Detective Su Changsheng, Zhang Mingde, and Detectives Jiang Shangpei, Geng Debiao, Wu Yao, Zu, Wu Chunrong, and Liu Xiangqi spent three days and nights searching and arresting twelve suspects. The locations of the arrests are listed below. Wang Zhongdao (also known as Zhongliang), a native of Hangzhou, and Wang Fusan (also known as Old Target Wang San), a native of Jiangbei, were arrested at No. 115 Xiaonan Wharf, Pudong. Wen Yongbao, a tea boy from Nanjing at the Liu Jingde Accounting Office, was arrested. (Yesterday's newspaper erroneously reported Wen Akun.) This case was, in fact, Wen's doing. Xu Honglin, a native of Jiangbei, was arrested at No. 38 Yanzike Lane, Jiumu Land, Nanshi. Chen Sandi (also known as Fenglan), a native of Changshu, was arrested at No. 112 Tianzhutang Street, Nanshi. Yang Longgen, a native of Pudong, was arrested in Room 620 of a hotel on Guangdong Road.

Cao Tongkun, a native of Changshu, was arrested at No. 8, Lane 51, East Third Lane, South Wharf, Pudong. Chen Zhaoji (also known as Lu Binzi, who supplied the handguns), a native of Jiangbei, was arrested at No. 53 Lafayette Road. Yesterday morning, they were all escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Ru Bao Yi and Chen Ming recounted the incident (details omitted as they were previously reported), stating that they were unable to investigate the large number of suspects in a timely manner and requesting a two-week extension. Chinese Officer No. 23398 testified that he was on duty escorting Western Officer No. 268 to arrest street vendors when he learned of the incident, whereupon he entered the building with Watchman No. 2128. They encountered the robbers descending the stairs, and a shootout ensued. The Western officer and the watchman were killed, and his two rounds of bullets were exhausted. The deceased robber then shot him in the abdomen, but the bullet was stopped due to the urgency of the situation. The deceased robber escaped and was shot dead by Officer No. 3165 and Officer No. 2975, who were guarding outside. The defendant, Wang Jinsheng, was arrested at the intersection of Shanxi Road by No. ○87. Detective Jiang then reported on the arrest of the remaining suspects.

### Two Battles of the Beining Football Team

Lost to Donghua 2-3 on New Year's Day, Lost to French Businessmen 1-4 on the 3rd

The Beining Qianlu Football Team played two matches in Shanghai during the New Year. On New Year's Day, they played against Donghua and lost 3-2. On the 3rd, they played against French Businessmen and lost 4-1. Beining lost both matches. The team returned north yesterday. In addition to the detailed report in our newspaper's extra edition, a summary is provided below.

Against Donghua

At 3:00 PM on New Year's Day, Beining played its first match against Donghua at Shen Garden. There were four to five thousand spectators. Neither side's performance was particularly impressive. Donghua seemed to be declining, and the defense was weak due to Li Ning's absence. The forwards, especially Sun Jinshun, were the best, followed by Lin Jing. Beining was almost unremarkable. The whole team couldn't coordinate. The forwards charged quickly but couldn't score. They seemed to lack experience. The backs were also mediocre, only taking advantage of their height.

In the first half, Donghua had a clear advantage, but the forwards couldn't make good use of it and missed many opportunities. At 25 minutes, Beining's right winger Sun Yongquan scored a goal because Zhang Rongcai failed to catch Jiang Lu's shot, and Yongquan took advantage of it. Donghua's inside backs were responsible for the mistake.

At the beginning of the second half, Donghua was spirited and the forwards were brave. Liu Zuru disrupted the flanks, making the forwards more active. At five minutes, Sun Jinshun single-handedly broke through and scored a goal for Donghua. Tan Fuzhen failed to catch him. Afterwards, Zhang Xueyao committed a foul and was penalized with a penalty kick. Sun Jinshun kicked but it was saved, but Chen Erde jumped first, so a retake was ordered and it was scored. At 20 minutes, Dai Linjing scored a beautiful goal from the left corner, making it 3-1. After this, Donghua seemed unwilling to attack again, and Lao Sun and others were just tourists on the field. As a result, the inside was tight. Even though Beining's forwards were weak, they still lost a goal. In the last three minutes, Jiang Lu scored a goal, ending the game 3-2. The lineups were as follows:

Against French Businessmen

In the afternoon of the 3rd, Beining played against French Businessmen at Shen Garden again. There were more spectators, about five to six thousand. The overall situation was more tense than the Donghua match, but it showed that French Businessmen were in control. French Businessmen only scored one goal in the first half, showing Beining's meticulous resistance, but the situation was completely different in the second half. Fortunately, Jiang Lu got a penalty kick and avoided a shutout, resulting in a 4-1 score.

Beining's loss was largely due to their lack of experience. Their performance seemed to have improved compared to New Year's Day. The whole team seemed to be calm and worked hard on offense and defense. In terms of strength, the defense was better than the offense. Zhang Xueyao and Ji Qingzhi, the two backs, and center back Tan Fuzhen performed the best. Without these three, they would have been overwhelmed by the sharp forwards of French Businessmen. Chen Erde's performance was not very impressive. His short stature seemed unsuitable for this position. The most regrettable thing was the weakness of the forwards' attack and the naive exposure of their strategy. Cooperation was also lacking. They often charged straight ahead single-handedly, resulting in nothing. If they could put more effort into cooperation, they would have had a considerable effect that day. The whole team's movements were too slow, resulting in many missed opportunities. Masan'er was absent from the French Businessmen team, and the game was very polite, as if they were not fighting hard. The situation was one-sided, and Bao Saizhong's business was very cold.

French Businessmen attacked first, and after two or three passes, they reached the goal, but they failed to score many times. Beining escaped danger three times and launched an offensive. After six minutes, Parker made a high cross on the sideline, which landed right under the goal. Chen Erde raised his hands to hold it, intending to make it a corner kick, but it fell in the same place. He used his hands to catch it again, but Bao Xuituo knocked it down. Jim Hwate gently touched it with his right foot, and the goal was lost. French Businessmen scored first. Beining counterattacked and got two chances at the goal. Jiang Lu missed the kick, and it was blocked by Kao Laituo. Sun Fulai was a step late and missed another opportunity. After this, Beining faced danger repeatedly, no less than four or five times. The line still missed good opportunities. Most unfortunately, Jiang Lu found a gap and shot hard, but Bao Saizhong missed it and hit the crossbar. Fafan Xiao's hard shot was scored, but it was declared invalid because Willie was offside. The first half ended with French Businessmen leading 1-0.

After the lemon, Beining's Jiang Lu was negligent, and Yin Fuzhen was careless, allowing Robert Stov to take advantage. After three steps, he reached the goal. Li Qingyu missed another opportunity, and Lao calmly took a low shot. Less than a minute after the kickoff, Beining lost a goal in a confused state. Although Beining fought hard to counterattack, they were still unable to break free. After a long time, the situation improved slightly, but they still failed to score due to a lack of skill, and it became a pipe dream. Jiang Lu attacked and Sun Fuli shot, but it was too hasty and went half a foot wide. After this, French Businessmen became more and more pressing. Sun Fulai also injured his shoulder due to excessive effort and left the field. Although Dr. Tu Kaiyuan rejoined him on the spot, he was unable to assist again. After this, Beining only played with ten players, and they were even more unable to support it.

Robert Stov shot twice in a row, but Chen Erde saved them all. Beining took advantage of the situation and advanced. Ke Laituo hit someone with his elbow while trying to save the ball and was penalized with a penalty kick. Jiang Lu executed it and scored, opening Beining's record. The situation still did not improve, and French Businessmen were confident of winning and became lax. Chen Erde was calmer than before and blocked two dangerous balls, performing very well. Sun Sijing also made some progress, but he failed to score twice due to insufficient speed. Before long, French Businessmen's Jim took a low shot and scored. Less than a minute after the restart, Robert Stov broke in again and gently flicked the net corner. Beining lost two goals in a minute, and the score was 4-1. The future looked even bleaker. Although they tried hard to the end, they failed. Beining finally lost to French Businessmen 4-1.

### Last Night's Xiqing Basketball Game, Xin Team Still Lost to Xintong

35-39, Four Points Behind, Referee Biased, Audience Outraged

In last night's intense Xiqing basketball game between the Xin team and the Xintong team, the Xin team lost by four points again, 35-39. In the first half, the Xin team led 17-22. This game had no championship implications, but the Xin team was determined to retaliate, so the game was very intense. Li Zhenzhong also joined to help. Unfortunately, the referees Bolato and others were biased and helped Xintong win, causing the Xin team to lose a game they could have won. The 500 spectators were outraged and cursed endlessly, which was also a great thing.

Xintong was weakened by Bessel's absence, leaving the backcourt empty and affecting the whole team. Only Carson was able to hold the field. The Xin team's performance was indeed better than before. In the first half, the referee blew the whistle repeatedly, and Chen Xianglong was ejected after committing four fouls in a few minutes. Feng Zhihua and Carson each had three fouls in the first half. At the beginning of the second half, the referee stopped blowing the whistle to protect Carson, so Feng and Ka fruit both played until the end of the game without being fouled. The inside story was clear to anyone with eyes.

At the beginning of the game, Xianglong scored two goals in a row, taking the lead 4-0. Zhenzhong, Binqing, and Nianhua attacked from all directions, creating a formidable 12-2 lead. During a moment of relaxation, Xintong also scored repeatedly, chasing the score to 9-12. At this time, Xianglong was ejected and Xu Jusheng replaced him. From then on, the score was close until the end of the first half, with the Xin team still leading 22-17. At the beginning of the second half, Xintong replaced Klaus, and gradually gained the lead, leading by two points until 33-31. Zhenzhong and Nianhua scored two goals, and the Xin team regained the lead 35-33. In the last three minutes, Xintong made free throws and scored, reaching the score of 39-35. In another university group game, Chizhi defeated Tongji in a one-sided match.

### Jinan Lost to Donghua

First Division Game, One to Zero

In the West Union Football First Division game between Donghua and Ji Nan, Donghua won with a score of 1-0 on the afternoon of the 3rd at Shenguo. In the first half, Li Yichen scored a goal after receiving a pass from Jia Youliang, taking the lead from then on. In the second half, neither side scored, so the game ended with a score of 1-0. Donghua added many players from the Second Division team yesterday, so the game was evenly matched and there were opportunities for both sides. The atmosphere was also very tense. The lineups of both sides were as follows:

### Japan Vigorously Implements Enslavement Education in Northeast China

More Than 700 Japanese Schools Do Not Allow the Study of Chinese Text, Japanese Police Listening Seats are Set Up in Classrooms, Ordering Girls to Bind Feet

[Northeast Changchun Correspondent] The Japanese invasion of Chinese culture is most active and severe in the Northeast. The most common phenomenon is that Japanese-established schools are located in large and small cities in the Northeast, totaling more than 700. In Japanese-established schools, the study of Chinese characters is not allowed, and the textbooks are entirely in Japanese. Other activities such as lectures and Q&A must be conducted in Japanese. Even Chinese history and geography are not allowed to be studied, while Japanese history and geography are considered basic courses. Chinese commemorative days are not holidays, but Japanese commemorative days must be holidays. The environment in which Northeast youth are in school, what they hear and see, is mostly Japanese specialties such as "Tenno's eternal lineage," "Yamato spirit," and "Bushido," which cause the Northeast youth to lose their national consciousness. In the public schools established by the Japanese in Lushun and Dalian, they are even publicly promoting the practice of binding feet among Chinese female students and not allowing Chinese education to talk about the Chinese situation. Moreover, Japanese police listening seats are set up in the classrooms of Jinzhou schools. When Chinese teachers' teaching slightly involves something unfavorable to Japan, they are punished. Alas, the Japanese people's viciousness in enslaving our Northeast youth compatriots is evident in this.

### On China Will Not Perish (2)

— Pan Gongzhan

Let us briefly examine the progress China has made over the past decade, as follows: Although the Republic of China has been established for twenty-five years, these cannot truly be counted as twenty-five years. In 1915, Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, followed by Zhang Xun's restoration and the chaos caused by warlord infighting in the Beiyang government. Since the Northern Expedition launched by the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) five years prior, until the "September 18th Incident" in 1931, the military and political period necessarily required focusing on internal stability and eliminating reactionary warlord forces, preventing genuine construction. After the "September 18th Incident," foreign threats became serious, and the Red bandits caused disturbances. Natural and man-made disasters intertwined and exacerbated the situation. The National Government, however, supported the precarious situation, truly embodying Mencius' saying: "When Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on a person, it first afflicts his mind, exhausts his sinews and bones." At this time, resisting foreign aggression and suppressing the Red bandits internally made peaceful construction impossible. Nevertheless, under the burden of humiliation, considerable achievements were made in the construction of highways and railways, the improvement of water conservancy and rural areas, the implementation of financial policies, and the development of light and heavy industries within five years. Furthermore, the reorganization of the army and the strengthening of the air force were steadily carried out in difficult and arduous circumstances, providing a small foundation for national defense. In particular, the currency system, which was fraught with obstacles and most difficult to reform, resolutely implemented the legal tender (fabi) policy at the end of 1935, unifying issuance, centralizing reserves, and stabilizing foreign exchange. As a result, the trade deficit gradually decreased, prices gradually rose, and the industrial and commercial sectors showed signs of vigorous growth. This is the effect of the legal tender policy. Previously, the suspension of convertibility of banknotes issued by the Bank of Communications during Yuan Shikai's era caused great disturbance. Now, the control of legal tender has achieved such great success. Similar achievements have been made in various aspects amidst unprecedented national crisis and tension, under the leadership of a great leader, and through hardship and difficulty. These are supported by facts, which we can find if we pay attention to searching and comparing in newspapers and magazines. It is not easy for the Chinese nation, under true unification, to stop destruction and rebuild while facing an unpredictable international environment. Yet we have been able to accomplish things one by one and make progress. Therefore, we guarantee that the Republic of China is a nation with great hope. Recently, Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe told Japanese reporters that Japanese "China experts" should no longer view China with the perspective of thirty or forty years ago but recognize the future of "Young China" and change their perceptions of China. Within Japan's cultural circles, there are also many who advocate fundamentally improving the China policy. This indeed reflects China's progress. Mr. Young, a reporter for the New York Times in the United States, also praised China's progress in recent years as an incredible "leap," whose miracle is no less than Japan's Meiji Restoration. Such extraordinary progress relies entirely on two major forces: first, organization. The Chinese Nationalist Party is a political party with a purpose and ideology, shouldering responsibility and striving towards a definite goal. Second, leadership. Steadfast and determined, bearing hardship and enduring blame, using great character to influence us and pointing out the bright path. Therefore, despite the blows of national crisis from the outside and the obstruction of rebellions from within, we are still constantly progressing.

Third, when comparing China with other countries in terms of time and space, although national construction may differ in ease, difficulty, speed, and slowness, there is absolutely no reason for it to perish. In the world, to accomplish anything, one cannot escape two factors: one is space, which pertains to the horizontal aspect; the other is time, which pertains to the vertical aspect. Some admire Mussolini for strengthening Italy, to the extent that the British Empire felt its Mediterranean hegemony threatened and had to lower its head to conclude the Mediterranean Gentlemen's Agreement with Italy. Through fifteen years of effort, from 1922 to 1937, Mussolini was able to achieve this. Should we not feel ashamed of what we have achieved in twenty-five years of nation-building? However, we cannot only look at time; we must also consider space. Italy is probably only the size of our Sichuan province, while China is almost the size of the continent of Europe. Europe is divided into many countries with various languages, writing systems, customs, and habits, but our ancestors passed down a unified writing system, with the only differences being Mongolian and Tibetan. The Manchu script has already disappeared. Mussolini's leadership of the Fascist Party to strengthen Italy is certainly admirable, but to be frank, China's leaders may be even greater. We firmly believe that Mussolini can strengthen Italy, but he may not necessarily be able to strengthen China because China has China's own environment. Since the space is vast, the time required must also be increased. Moreover, the Nationalist Party has only truly led China for about ten years since the Northern Expedition. For most of these ten years, the interior was neither unified nor consistently believing in the leader and supporting the government. Even when construction work was being done, it was threatened by foreign enemies. The revival of such a country is certainly many times more difficult than that of Italy. Yet our government has been working hard and quietly to achieve this. Consider how great our leader is. Post-war Germany, under the leadership of Hitler's Nazi Party, restored its international status in a short period. Hitler is truly a peerless hero, and everyone naturally admires him. However, the degree of difficulty in Germany's revival compared to China's is immeasurable. Germany's scientific development and the level of knowledge among the general public are truly beyond China's reach. (To be continued)

### Gold Circulation Volume in the Past Three Years in the Financial Market

The Purchasing Power of Various Parties is Indeed Astonishing, Reaching 735,630 Taels

In recent years, due to economic and political factors, China's gold has experienced significant activity. Shanghai, being the most important commercial port in China, coupled with the presence of the Gold Exchange providing an open gold market, attracts merchants from the interior and various communities. However, the quantity is extremely limited, as the right to export gold is controlled by the Central Bank. Nevertheless, the monthly cash settlement volume according to the Gold Exchange is astonishing. Besides the Central Bank's use of gold as leverage for remittances, a considerable amount is also held by financial institutions. A brief statistical summary of the Gold Exchange's settlement volume over the past three years reveals that 1935 was the most active year, reaching 332,360 taels. This was due to the implementation of legal tender, which raised gold prices, prompting merchants from other ports to sell. In 1934, the volume was only 107,590 taels, with short positions closed out at a value of 154,490 taels. This was due to the Central Bank's initial attempt to control gold speculation, and the Gold Exchange's settlement method was not yet perfect, allowing short sellers to take advantage. In 1936, spot settlements totaled 295,680 taels, while only 35,350 taels were closed out, indicating that the Central Bank indeed has the power to control the gold market. However, due to the large-scale purchases by various parties, reserves have been dwindling, making it difficult to maintain such activity this year. With the Gold Exchange using London pure gold as the settlement price, the gold market is unlikely to experience major fluctuations, thus impacting the source of gold. The gold circulation volume based on the Gold Exchange's cash settlement volume over the past three years is detailed below:

Over these three years, a total of 73,563 contracts, equivalent to 735,630 taels, were settled. The number of contracts closed out, apart from 1935, was highest in 1934. A table is also provided below:

### Public Notes Redeemed at the Gold Exchange in January are Extremely Few

Less Than One-Tenth of the Total

Only 210 public notes for January 1937 were redeemed at the Gold Exchange yesterday by short sellers, accounting for less than one-tenth of the total. A total of 2,086 public notes remain uncleared, held by five long parties and six short parties. The detailed figures for public note redemptions are recorded below: Those redeemed by the long parties yesterday included 98 contracts by Da Fengheng, 63 contracts by Fangda, 28 contracts by Dadecheng, 14 contracts by Yongfeng, and 7 contracts by Tongtaichang. The total number of contracts to be redeemed by the long parties today includes 91 contracts by Futaixing, 49 contracts by Chunyuan Yong, 28 contracts by Qingfa Yong, 21 contracts by Shengyuan Yong, and 21 contracts by Qiafeng Yong, totaling 210 contracts. The settlement price is 1,154 yuan. Observing the current situation, the short positions previously sold by a certain firm have not only not been closed out but have shown a trend of being accumulated.

Recent Imports of Paper Currency

Since the implementation of state ownership of silver and the circulation of legal tender, hard currency has disappeared from the market, and the number of banknotes in circulation has greatly increased. These banknotes, except for a small portion printed by the Zhonghua Book Company, are mostly printed by British and American companies. Therefore, ships arriving in Shanghai from the UK often carry these banknotes. The British ship Bangalore, which arrived on the third of this month, carried eight boxes of five-yuan notes and twenty-three boxes of one-yuan notes, totaling thirty-one boxes.

### Securities

Large Investors Ceaselessly Absorbing, Classes A and B Bonds Continuously Hitting New High Prices

Due to the New Year holiday and settlement days, public bonds were traded for only three days last week. The market was stable, and the upward trend was strong. Market sentiment was also extremely firm. Major investors were purchasing, with a strong appetite. The number of tradable contracts on the market was rather depleted. Therefore, the upward trend was rare. Market prices rose sharply step by step. In particular, Classes A and B bonds experienced active buying. Class B bonds once reached a new price of 67.3 yuan. Class A bonds set three new records, reaching a peak of 76.2 yuan. The vigorous trend showed no signs of slowing down. Starting today, normal operations will resume, and all bonds will be traded as usual. However, due to the firm market sentiment and current situation, the bond market still has the potential for further progress. The progress of the whole week is as follows: On Monday, trading for February began. Due to settled sentiment and active buying by large investors, bonds Nos. 35, 5, and 47 were purchased aggressively. Market prices rose across the board by 80 cents to 1.2 yuan. On Tuesday, the market was closed for the settlement procedures for December contracts. On Wednesday, the appetites of large investors grew stronger, and the momentum expanded. Many retail investors also followed suit and purchased. All unified bonds rose by 30 to 90 cents. Class A bonds surged by more than 1 yuan. On Thursday, market sentiment remained strong, and large investors continued to purchase. However, some holdings had already been released, so the price increase slowed slightly. On Friday and Saturday, the market was closed due to the New Year's Day. As a result of the entire week, January bonds rose by 1.4 to 1.8 yuan. February bonds were newly issued. The total trading volume was 40.67 million yuan. A comparison of the gains, losses, highs, and lows is listed below (unit: yuan; trading unit: 100 yuan):

### Yarn and Cotton

The Yarn and Cotton Market in 1936 Experienced Rare Prosperity
Yarn Transactions Reached 22.84 Million Bales, Cotton Transactions Reached 50.13 Million Quintals, More Than Half of the Increase Compared to 1935, Second Half Dividends Could Pay Ten Yuan

During the year 1936, the yarn and cloth exchange market experienced vigorous trading and repeated disturbances, a first since the establishment of the yarn exchange. Even the special margin for standard yarn and cotton was repeatedly increased and decreased, indicating that market prices were unpredictable and fluctuations were surging. The situation during the year is briefly described below.

In the first half of the year, the yarn and cotton market was relatively stable. Although financial circles, public bond merchants, and gold industry groups, due to their own sluggish operations, shifted their speculative targets to the yarn and cotton market and purchased actively, the market once rose. But the trend was still peaceful, because the yarn sales in the spring were not strong, and the stock yarn was strong, so the market fluctuations were very small. Until mid-July, a party focused on collecting and buying July and August mature cotton. For the sake of prudence, the exchange increased special cash margins in two or three batches, but it was still difficult to curb the buying party's enthusiasm. The exchange, in view of the poor situation, announced the suspension of new trading in all July and August contracts. At that time, the market price rose to 52.5 yuan. Market rumors were varied, with floating longs and floating shorts interlocked, and a storm temporarily subsided.

In the second half of the year, because this year's national cotton and rice were abundant, the purchasing power of the villagers was strengthened. Autumn sales developed, and cloth took the lead. Also, because yarn factories had economic difficulties over the years, and mature cotton rose to 52.5 yuan, the factories lost money and found it more difficult to maintain operations. A portion of the yarn factories announced closures or reduced production. In North China, Chinese yarn factories in the Tianjin area sold 500,000 yarn spindles to Japanese merchants, and production was greatly reduced. As a result, yarn stocks decreased, and the demand for sales increased. The factories were unable to meet the demand with sufficient yarn. After five years of fatigue, the yarn industry now has the benefit of a bumper year, so it presents a turn for the better. The buyers, in view of the lack of spot goods, swept away 50,000 bales of yarn in storage. The volume of Guangdong, Changsha, and other inland parties increased. General speculators took the opportunity to become active and worked hard to absorb in the futures yarn market. In mid-October, cotton yarn deposits soared to 1,146,350 bales, and cotton deposits soared to 2,090,700 quintals. The development of exchange operations can be seen. The number of long and short contracts increased greatly, and the range of ups and downs became larger. There were sudden jumps of four or five yuan and drops of four yuan every day. The market often closed late into the night. On October 19, because spot prices soared by 14 yuan and yarn jumped by 30 yuan, a certain gentleman vigorously purchased the October and November contracts, which rose to the stop-limit level. The October contract was 240 yuan. Then, as those who profited left the market, the market situation was peaceful for a while. Until the beginning of December, the Osaka Sanpin yarn market showed a significant upward trend. Labor strikes in Shanghai and Qingdao were frequent, and market sentiment was particularly strong. The factory's current yarn stock was extremely depleted. The China Cotton Corporation suddenly came in to buy, and outsiders such as gold merchants and securities firms further fueled the rising trend. In recent months, it has risen again to the stop-limit. According to exchange rules, after the settlement of one-month contracts, another month continues. The April contracts next year will be introduced after the settlement of the October contracts. In order to crack down on speculation and limit the months, the government shortened the period. However, the exchange had already started operations. On November 5, the Ministry issued an order prohibiting the opening of trading, and suddenly removed the April yarn and cotton contracts. The exchange was responsible for settling the trades made by paying the difference. The stop-limit price for December was 253.8 yuan. The authorities, due to the sharp rise, heavily levied special margins, which increased to 32 yuan this month. Including the original margin, each package cost a total of 42 yuan. The margin for the remaining months, including the original margin, was also 32 yuan. However, the rising force was still sharp. The December peak once reached 268 yuan, creating a new record since 1918. Extended to the end of the year, the factory stock loosened slightly. There were 3,000 packages of 10-count coarse yarn, 1,000 packages of 20-count and 16-count yarn, and a total of 7,700 packages were delivered, and the market situation was slightly peaceful. Because the cotton harvest was abundant this year, the market was very stable. The exchange's annual trading volume also increased sharply. Cotton yarn had 22,847,600 packages, and cotton had 50,135,400 quintals, an increase of more than half compared to 1935. Therefore, the dividend for the second half of the year could be as high as 10 yuan, which shows the development of operations. The closing price of the recent yarn was 251.4 yuan, which was 54.4 yuan higher than the closing price of the recent yarn last year, which was 197 yuan. The high and low prices of standard yarn and cotton throughout the year and the high and low prices of 60-count and 20-count current yarn throughout the year are listed below, with a standard yarn price difference of 75.8 yuan, a 60-count yarn price difference of 145 yuan, a 42-count yarn price difference of 92.5 to 121.5 yuan, and a 20-count yarn price difference of 73 to 76 yuan. A table is then listed below for reference:

Unfavorable US Cotton Export Transactions

US cotton opened on the 31st. Due to good news from Liverpool, peer companies and foreign merchants bought, and each month rose by one to three pounds first. Then, due to long position settlements and broker sales, the market price plummeted. According to Washington news, US cotton export transactions are gradually showing an unfavorable trend. Peer companies are mostly watching, fearing that the government will sell loan cotton. Before the close, long positions continued to be settled. At the close, peer companies bought. As a result, spot prices fell by four pounds, and futures prices fell by three to six pounds. UK cotton spot prices rose by six points, and futures prices rose by three to four points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to short selling, but then recovered due to speculation. On balance, Pingguoer rose by 2 to 2.25 rupees, Aomula rose by 1.75 to 2 rupees, and Bairuoxi rose by 2.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left.

According to a Bombay telegram, the opening prices on the 4th are predicted to be 230.5 rupees for Bairuoxi, 209.25 rupees for Aomula, and 179 rupees for Pingguoer, all down by one rupee.

Sanpin Yarn and Cotton Fell Sharply

According to a telegram from Osaka on the 4th, Sanpin yarn futures rose by 60 cents to a fall of 3.7 yuan, with the near month at 262.7 yuan and the far month at 250 yuan. Cotton futures fell by 1.05 yuan to 1.25 yuan, with the near month at 70.9 yuan and the far month at 73 yuan.

Bombay Cotton Industry Weekly Report

Last week, Japanese yarn rose. Export demand increased greatly. Speculators bought. Market prices were strong. Exporters had sold heavily, so they bought futures cotton in large quantities. At the same time, in the Aomula region, inland markets also purchased a large amount of mainland and Lancashire cotton. The markets were unusually quiet due to the holiday. New cotton trading will be active again after the New Year, as it was before the holiday.

### Grain

A Review of the Paddy Rice Market in the Twenty-Fifth Year: Annual Actual Sales Reach 3.8 Million Bags, with Local Merchants Accounting for 60% and Guangdong Merchants for 30%

In the twenty-fifth year, the market price of paddy rice did not fluctuate significantly and the process followed a normal pattern. In the first two months of the year, high-quality rice did not exceed ten yuan. From March to August, the market was slightly more active, but it remained stable. Later, due to the news of a poor harvest in Guangdong, people's expectations gradually increased, but the highest price still did not exceed ten yuan (excluding glutinous rice). Until the end of the year, the price remained stable. However, due to the looming world war, countries began stockpiling grain, causing domestic grain prices to soar temporarily. Some county governments even issued orders prohibiting the export of rice. Therefore, in late November and mid-December, the market was briefly affected, but the price only fluctuated by seven or eight jiao before quickly returning to normal. This was because the supply from Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces was adequate and suitable for sales. As for the sales market, the first half of the year was mainly driven by local merchants and inland areas, followed by Shantou and Xiamen. In the second half of the year, Guangdong province became the largest market, followed by Henan and Xiamen. There were also many other sporadic sales. The total annual rice transactions, according to publicly available figures from the market, were just over 2.3 million bags. However, based on general estimates, the actual amount was no less than 3.8 million bags, a difference of 1.5 million bags. Of this difference, 400,000 bags were stockpiled, and the rest were transactions made through private deals. According to suppliers, Hunan rice accounted for about 700,000 bags, Jiangxi rice for 2 million bags, Hubei rice for 700,000 bags, Zhejiang rice for 300,000 bags, and other areas such as Jiangbei for 100,000 bags. After deducting the 400,000 bags of stockpiled rice, local merchants sold 60%, Guangdong province accounted for 30%, and Henan province for 0.25%. The various market prices are listed below, along with the statistics for foreign rice. This foreign rice, as well as the remaining stock from the twenty-fourth year, no longer had an official market price from May onwards, and only merchants were offering it for sale.

Rice from the North Rises Sharply by 30-40 Cents After Three Days of Market Closure

[South Shanghai] Yesterday, after a three-day closure, the arrival of goods from various sources was slightly more active, with a total of 150-160 boats arriving, carrying a total of 32,000-33,000 dan (a unit of dry measure). Among them, there were over a hundred boats carrying Bo Dao (thin rice). Also, the retail shops in the city and countryside showed a strong interest in purchasing goods after the three-day suspension, and wholesale merchants were also brisk. It is estimated that merchants from Pingjin, Yantai, Qingdao and other regions purchased over 10,000 bags of Bo Dao. Therefore, the market quickly became tight, and prices rose sharply. As a result, the price of Bo Dao increased by 20-30 cents per load, and the price of Zhongguan (medium-grade rice) increased by more than 40 cents. The price of Hou Geng (thick rice) also increased by 40-50 cents, Du Yangjian (a type of high-quality rice) increased by 30-40 cents, and Yin Yuan increased by about 40 cents.

[North Shanghai] Since the New Year, 150-160 boats have arrived from various places in the north. The market opened yesterday, and prices soared. Bai Geng (white rice) was in high demand, and the price suddenly increased by 30-40 cents. Early rice and Bo Dao were also actively sold, with prices increasing by 20-40 cents. The price of Yangbu Du Kejian (another type of high-quality rice) also increased by 20-30 cents, and the price increased by about 30 cents from the original price. The prices of all other types of goods also increased by 10-30 cents. The total market sales were about 15,000-16,000 dan. It is expected that the prices of all goods will continue to rise.

Soybean Sales at Factories Are Extremely Strong

Yesterday, the miscellaneous grain spot market was open for the first day after the New Year's holiday. Therefore, the market was very active, and most prices remained stable. Due to the high prices of oil cakes, soybean sales at oil mills remained strong. Yesterday, 18 carts of Siping Street soybeans, 2 carts of Bengbu soybeans, 1 cart of Yingzhou soybeans, 1 cart of Suixikou soybeans, and over 5,000 bags of Zhadou and Chidou from other inland cart workshops, local merchants, and the Fuzhou gang were sold. Over 200 bags of Du Dou Sha Huang and 300 bags of other beans, and 550 bags of Dingjia Zhou beans were sold. The price of high-quality goods increased by 3-4 cents, while the price of medium and lower-quality goods remained stable.

Oil Cakes Continue to Rise, Japanese Merchants Purchase 12,000 Pieces of Changde Cakes

The market for soybean oil and soybean cakes continued the excellent trend of the previous year and rose unanimously. Soybean oil rose by 40-50 cents compared to the closing price of last year. Yesterday, 1,400 pieces of various oils were traded, and 2,200 pieces of peanut oil were traded at the original price. In addition to inland merchants, Japanese merchants were also interested in purchasing soybean cakes, so everyone was optimistic about the market, and prices immediately rose. A total of 28,000 pieces of various factory "Four-Brand" cakes were traded. In addition to the 12,000 pieces of Changde cakes purchased by Japanese merchants, the rest were sold inland.

Jiangsu Province to Implement Wheat Grading: 741 Types of Wheat Divided into Four Grades, Implementation Method Initially Discussed Yesterday

The Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau are jointly organizing food grading to facilitate transportation and sales, starting with wheat. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has allocated 8,000 yuan, and the Commodity Inspection Bureau has analyzed and researched 741 types of wheat in Jiangsu Province, dividing them into grades according to standards such as wheat quality and moisture content. This has already been completed. However, the purpose of wheat grading is to establish market standards and facilitate production and sales. Therefore, this grading standard has been sent to the Shanghai Food Industry Association for comments. It is learned that yesterday, Cai Wuji, the director of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, hosted a banquet for Gu Xinyi, the chairman of the Food Industry Association, and representatives of various flour mills, along with Hou Houpei, the representative of the Jiangsu Department of Finance, to discuss the implementation method. As a result of the discussion, the Food Industry Association will submit its comments to the Commodity Inspection Bureau, and then a meeting will be held in Zhenjiang to discuss the implementation. It is said that this grading will be carried out by the farmers' associations in various parts of Jiangsu Province, with the assistance of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers' Bank. However, it is not an inspection and will not charge any fees. The complex varieties of wheat in various parts of China are inconvenient for both buyers and sellers. If grading is implemented according to market standards, it will be convenient for factories to purchase and merchants to procure. Therefore, its implementation will be beneficial to both the improvement of varieties in production areas and the market in sales areas.

### Hardware

Thick Tinplate Sales Are Very Strong, Market Prices Have Risen Significantly

Due to a certain application, sales of thick tinplate have been very strong recently. Therefore, even during the New Year's holiday, there were still many people searching for and inquiring about it. A total of over a hundred boxes were offered. Due to environmental factors, prices have risen significantly. The detailed information on the recent market is reported below:

Grade 22 was in short supply on the market, and the price rose sharply. Each box (200 pounds) was sold for 70 yuan. It was found that over ten boxes were offered, and they were purchased by hardware factories.

On the 24th, heavy tinplate was sold for 90 yuan (per box of 372 pounds). Over forty boxes were purchased by yarn factories and hardware factories. The market was very strong due to the scarcity of goods.

On the 26th, the market was closed for many days, and the price rose to 100 yuan (per box of 295 pounds). However, buyers were still eager to purchase, but the market supply was insufficient, causing late buyers to regret their inability to purchase.

On the 28th, there were fewer transactions, but the arrival of goods was not high, so the asking price was also very high, with each box (200 pounds) selling for 50 yuan.

### Special Article: Wartime Finance

— Xi Dongshu

Lecture at the Army University Memorial Week

[Omitted above] War is the most risky thing, and the losses in manpower and material resources are incalculable. Our China is a country that loves peace and is determined not to start a war lightly. Chairman Chiang has said that we will never give up peace until all hope is lost, and we will never speak of sacrifice until the last moment. These words can show our nation's spirit of courtesy for the country and indicate our strategy for dealing with the environment. I remember that Lao Tzu of the Zhou Dynasty, everyone said that he was a Taoist, but he was actually a great statesman. He once said, "In warfare, there is a saying, 'I dare not be the host but be the guest.'" "Dare not be the host" means daring not to be the one who initiates the war, and "be the guest" means being ready to deal with the enemy at any time. Lao Tzu also said, "Weapons are ominous instruments, and one uses them only as a last resort." Weapons are tools for destroying peace, so they are called ominous, but when it is absolutely necessary, one can only use military force to solve everything. Chairman Chiang's words are consistent with what Lao Tzu said. We certainly do not want to give up peace or speak of sacrifice lightly. On the one hand, we must always be prepared for the despair of peace and the last moment. Therefore, wartime finance is also an important preparation that must be studied.

War is the total mobilization of a country's manpower and material resources. The final victory or defeat depends entirely on the strength of each belligerent country. The center of war is all in economics. In other words, today's war is an economic war. Napoleon once said that money is the lifeblood of war, and money is the price of manpower and material resources. If there is no solution to the economy, there will be no prosperity in the war. We can take two things from Germany to prove it: (1) In 1911, when the Moroccan incident occurred, at first, Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany had a very fierce attitude, and the war was about to break out. Then, under various pressures from Britain, Germany's tough proposition changed to a moderate attitude. The biggest reason was still the economy. At that time, several countries in Europe had invested a lot in Germany. Seeing the tense international situation, they quickly withdrew their funds from Germany. As a result, the German people also rushed to withdraw money from banks, resulting in a financial panic. This state of domestic financial unrest made Germany, which was aggressively expanding its military, swallow its anger and dare not start a war hastily. It can be seen that the economy and war are closely related. (2) When the last World War broke out, Germany had made full preparations beforehand. Germany, with a territory smaller than the three northeastern provinces, took on many powerful countries in the world and fought a decisive battle. It lasted for four years and three months, and it never suffered any military failures. However, in the end, it could not support it. Finally, it signed the Treaty of Versailles to make peace with humiliation. The main reason for its failure was still economic problems. Because after Germany was economically blockaded by the Allies, raw materials and food were lacking, and its combat power was reduced. The people's livelihood was in extreme poverty, and the domestic finances were in chaos. Finally, the Allied powers got the participation of the United States, which was rich in manpower and material resources. Germany's resistance was even more disparate compared to the Allies. Therefore, it had to stop military operations to seek peace. It can be seen that the focus of the war is still on the economy. If the economy is not managed properly, the military will absolutely not be able to advance smoothly. Therefore, we must conduct sufficient research on the problem of wartime finance in advance.

If we want to plan wartime finance, I think what we should study can be divided into three points.

(1) We should understand the nature of future wars, the impact on our original finances, and the economic environment in which we are in after the war, so that we can have a basis for planning finances.

(2) Estimation of wartime expenditure.

(3) How to raise the huge war expenses in this extraordinary period.

According to the economy left over from the European War, and then look at the contradiction between the economic interests of international groups, and the formation of two major barriers by major countries, coupled with the close proximity of modern sea, land and air transportation, it can be asserted that future wars must be internationalized, and future wars will become the Second World War. The day the Second World War comes, China will be swept into the vortex. This war is bound to affect the whole country, not just a few big cities along the river and coast will inevitably suffer its ravages. The scale of the war must be unprecedented, and domestic industry and commerce will suffer extreme destruction due to the military impact, and some of them will fall into a state of complete stagnation. This major disturbance in the market is enough to make the already poor country feel more difficult financially. China's economy was originally an agrarian economy. The industry is still in its infancy, the scale of commerce is also very small, the credit system is not fully developed, the transportation system is not perfect, and the people's wealth is also very low. In this economic environment, if we want to use the credit system to quickly raise more than 10 million yuan at one time, it is originally very difficult. Once something happens, the coastal trading ports will inevitably be blockaded by the enemy, and international trade, even if it does not stop completely, will feel very difficult and cannot proceed smoothly. The most important item in our tax revenue, customs duties, is bound to plummet. The various wartime environments make our financial planning more difficult. Among them, the most problematic source of finance is the few provinces that have been invaded by foreign forces. Not only can manpower and financial resources not be fully utilized, but they simply cannot be included in the entire financial plan. This has also become a very heavy blow to our finances.

The future universalized war is enough to fundamentally shake our small-scale finance. In addition to universalization, future wars may also have a long time. On the one hand, it will increase the financial burden to a huge number, and on the other hand, it will make the peacetime financial income suffer a long-term loss. According to the history of wars in the past, the Napoleonic War lasted for 24 years and eight months, the Crimean War, the Franco-Prussian War, the Sino-Japanese War, and the Russo-Japanese War, some lasted for seven months, and some lasted for more than two years. The European War lasted for four years and three months. Recently, a country with backward material civilization, such as Abyssinia, fought against Italy. The comparison of the strengths of the two countries is very different, and it has lasted for seven months. Although the future war may not last for five years, seven years, eight years, or ten years, it is inevitable to extend it to one year, two years, or three years due to the wide area of ​​modern war and the large number of mobilized people. Therefore, to plan our wartime finance, we must be prepared for a long-term financial supply, and we must find new and more reliable sources of finance. Our original tax revenue is unreliable. Our central tax revenue has always been dominated by customs duties, salt tax, and consolidated tax. For example, in the three years from the twenty-first year to the twenty-fourth year, the average annual total tax revenue was less than 650 million yuan. Customs duties accounted for almost 55 percent on average, accounting for more than half. The sum of salt tax and consolidated tax accounts for about 43 percent. These three indirect consumption taxes account for about 97 percent of the total tax revenue. The remaining stamp duty, tobacco and alcohol tax, and other taxes are very small. The so-called central tax revenue is nothing more than these three types of consumption taxes, customs duties, salt tax, and consolidated tax. If the country is in trouble, customs duties, which account for more than half of the tax revenue, will immediately cause problems. On the one hand, it will shake the basic income of the national treasury, and on the other hand, it will also affect the country's credit due to the guarantee of foreign debts. As for salt tax, salt is a necessity of life, and the poor eat more salt because of their labor than the rich. (To be continued)

### Research on Our Four Hundred Million Compatriots

— 拾玖

The Chinese people, numbering four hundred million, is merely a rounded figure. It is a reference to the so-called "four hundred million compatriots." This has been around for a long time, and this figure existed in the late Qing Dynasty. Then, what about the rise and fall of the Chinese population in previous dynasties before the late Qing Dynasty? This is worth mentioning for the reference of our current four hundred million compatriots.

Wang Tao's Tao Yuan Wen Ji Wai Bian Chong Min Pian Shang has listed the rise and fall of the population in past dynasties. For the sake of clarity, a table is created as follows:

The above table shows the tens of thousands in the middle.

According to the above table, the total Chinese population at the end of the Daoguang reign in the Qing Dynasty was only slightly more than 50% of the current population. Then, what about after the Daoguang reign? Wang said again: "Although the disturbances of the Nian Rebellion occurred during the Xianfeng reign, after more than ten years of recuperation, the registered population has not decreased. To this day, it can be roughly estimated that there are 300 million households." This is the rough estimate of the Chinese population at the turn of the Tongzhi and Guangxu reigns.

The rise and fall of the population is closely related to the country's peace and stability. For example, from Emperor Ping of the Han Dynasty to Emperor Guangwu, after Wang Mang usurped the Han Dynasty and Guangwu quelled the rebellion, the population greatly decreased. "The people are the foundation of the state." It is gratifying that we now have four hundred million compatriots!

### Idle Talk About Huaqing Pool

— Choucheng

The previous publication of Yang Gong Huaijun's work was brief and not detailed, so this article is added to supplement it. Editor

Huaqing Pool is originally a scenic spot. Since President Chiang Kai-shek's Xi'an Incident, the name Huaqing Pool has become known throughout the country. Yesterday, I met Manager Xia Xishi of the Zhongxi Pharmacy, and Associate Manager Lu Jiayan. I asked them if they had traveled to that place when they went to Shaanxi recently. According to them, they had visited once, and in addition to bathing, they also drank the spring water wildly. I asked them what the scenery was like there. What they answered was very specific, so I recorded it.

Huaqing Pool is located between Lintong County and Mount Li. Mount Li is northeast of Xi'an, namely the northern mountain of Lantian, also known as Fudi Mountain. About half a kilometer to the north is the ancient Li Rong country of the Zhou Dynasty and the Li Yi county of the Qin Dynasty, which now belongs to Lintong County. There is hot spring water coming out from the foot of the mountain, which can be used to treat scabies. The Huaqing Palace built by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang Dynasty is now Huaqing Pool. Consort Yang Guifei once bathed here, as described in the Song of Everlasting Regret. Scribes and poets of past dynasties have also written about it, which has been passed down to this day. This time when I went to Shaanxi, I took a special trip there by car. From Xi'an out of the east gate to that place, it is 50 li (Chinese mile), about one hour's drive. In the middle, we passed Baqiao, one of the Eight Scenic Spots of Chang'an, which is an important transportation hub connecting Jin, Yu, Long, and Shu (Shanxi, Henan, Gansu, and Sichuan). The Huaqing Pool in the Tang Dynasty included Lintong County, with a very large area and magnificent architecture, reaching the extreme. Pavilions and buildings were everywhere, but they no longer exist today. The statue of Lao Tzu in the Lao Tzu Temple on the mountain is made of white stone, which is said to be a relic of the Tang Dynasty. It was very desolate in the Qing Dynasty. Now that China Travel Service has gone to renovate it, it is more prosperous than a dozen years ago. The bathroom is divided into first, second, and third class, and the equipment is similar to that of Tangshan in the capital. The bathing fee for the first class is one yuan per person, the second class is six jiao per person, and the third class is two jiao per person. There is also one that does not charge bathing fees, called the Public Bath, because the water flows out from the hot spring and is installed with iron pipes, and the heat is natural, unlike the water in ordinary bathrooms, which must be heated by burning. Nearby, according to the height of the mountain, there are lotus ponds, corridors, and small bridges. Although it is not as magnificent as in the Tang Dynasty, the ancient trees tower into the sky, the red railings are winding, and the bath is taken in a small rest, which is enough to wash away the dust and refresh the body and mind. The dozen or so buildings built on the mountainside are even more exquisite. President Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, Ms. Soong Mei-ling, once visited and stayed here. When we (Xia and Lu referred to themselves) were drinking tea, we felt that the taste was very clear, and we drank wildly to four large pots. When we returned to Xi'an, local friends asked how many pots of tea we drank. After telling them in detail, they all said that those who visit Huaqing Pool either do not drink or drink several pots, because the taste of this water is really special, but the more you drink, the more thirsty you become, which is very strange.

### Swapping Phoenix for a Luan

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Episode 9 (A Cup of Water Pledges Heart, A Green Lamp Talks of Withered Beauty, A Gilded Hook Promises, Red Beans Convey Longing)

What could Guoqi say? He just thanked her. He himself was also feeling at a loss for words, not knowing what to say to her. Fortunately, Zhang Laoda came and said to Youmei with a smile, "Yesterday, Guoqi told me that he asked Miss Li to find material for writing articles. I told him that the weather is too hot, so it is not suitable for people to run back and forth." Youmei smiled and said, "It doesn't matter. If my aunt doesn't mind that I'm being too bothersome, I'll still ask my cousin to be my teacher and learn Chinese from him." Zhang Laotai said, "We're family, so there's no need to be so polite. You can ask him whatever you want. Fortunately, I'm always at home, so there's nothing inconvenient." "It's hot in the room, let's go to the hall to cool off." Since she came in the morning, there's no need for me to persuade her to stay. She can have lunch here before leaving. Youmei smiled and agreed, because the old lady was standing at the door waiting, so she had to go to the hall with him. After lunch, she originally wanted to go to Guoqi's room to sit for a while, but for some reason, she always felt a bit ashamed and didn't want to find an excuse to go. Because the old lady had asked Liu Ma what time it was, she thought to herself that perhaps people were saying that she had been sitting for too long, so she said goodbye and left. The next day, after a day's interval, on the third day in the morning, Guoqi was about to take the finished manuscript to the post office to mail it. When he walked out of the gate and didn't reach ten zhang (a unit of length), Youmei came face to face. Guoqi didn't even think about it, nodded to her, and asked a common greeting, "Where is Miss Li going?" Youmei stopped, tilted the green silk parasol on her shoulder, and smiled, "To a classmate's house. Cousin, can you guess who I'm going to visit?" Guoqi said in a low voice, "Are you going to Jiang's mansion?" Youmei said, "Yes. Cousin is going out, see you another day." Guoqi said goodbye to her and walked on, thinking to himself, "What does this Miss Li mean? She's so shy when she sees me, and she speaks in a hesitant manner. Could it be that she doesn't want to take on the task of passing on letters?" It was she who volunteered, and he didn't ask her to do it. If she doesn't want to take on the task, then she doesn't have to. However, it would be very embarrassing for him to refuse her to pass on letters. He would just not write letters to her in the future. Fortunately, he only had her send a red bean once, so it wasn't too difficult. Thinking like this, he felt that he had untied the rope of Li Youmei. The next morning, he went out to visit a few friends, and only returned home in the afternoon. (118)

### Legends About Zhao Jun's Tomb

— Bai Xia (Sent from Guihuan)

Zhao Jun's tomb is located in the fields about twenty miles south of Guihua City. Now, besides the remaining octagonal stone tablet, there is only the green mound, nearly twenty yards high. However, every year, people from all over come to Sui to visit and pay their respects at this tomb. Moreover, the villagers living around Guihua still hold a respectful heart for Zhao Jun's tomb, thus legends about Zhao Jun's tomb have arisen.

It is said that after Wang Zhao Jun jumped into the Black River and committed suicide, her ghost often wandered around the original site of the green mound. Therefore, the local people of the northern frontier at that time buried her body there, which became the current green mound. It is also said that among the octagonal stone tablets in front of the green mound, the one on the left originally had a stone slab in front of it. Underneath the stone slab, there was a deep hole. In the past, when villagers in the vicinity had weddings or needed a lot of plates, bowls, chopsticks, etc., they often burned incense and prayed to Wang Zhao Jun's ghost, and listed the names of the required items on a yellow paper. They would then stick the paper under the stone slab. In just a blink of an eye, all the required items would be placed in front of the tomb, allowing those who borrowed them to take them back for use. However, after use, they had to be returned to the tomb immediately, where Zhao Jun's ghost would take them back. However, because there were many greedy people, they intended not to return the bowls and dishes they borrowed from Zhao Jun. But Wang Zhao Jun did not allow anyone to take advantage. Her ghost would run into the homes of those who borrowed the items and either break or smash the borrowed items, in short, none of the borrowed items could be kept. However, there were still many greedy people, which made Zhao Jun's ghost lose her temper and seal the entrance of the deep hole. After that, no matter how people prayed, she would no longer lend things to them.

Although this legend is laughable, it contains many lessons and also reveals the hardship of life for the people in the border region. Even for just a bowl or a chopstick, they could have thoughts of greed!

### Duke Jiang Returns to the Capital, Composing a Poem on Celebrating the Victory at Changjin

— Hu Junfu

This situation is truly unpredictable, your subject is foolish and does not know. The majestic writing has no weak strokes, the brilliant move turns a crisis into an opportunity. Benevolence and courage are taken as the foundation, safety and danger are not to be dwelt upon. Forged in the furnace of Mo, the great lake is mixed with dragons. Why create disturbances, how can public opinion bear it? Moreover, hearing about resisting enemies, it is precisely the time to obtain bravery. The wind and snow are urgent on the head, the passes and rivers enter the view late. A corrupt heart is not overnight, misleading the country is not stubborn foolishness. Not fearing the warning of sharing the same boat, who will support the great mansion? Seeking to stretch, sneering at the inchworm, speaking of the law, roaring like a lion. Merit and fault are matters of a thousand autumns, kindness and resentment are matters of laughter. Two phoenixes soar in the clouds, six dragons gallop beyond the heavens. Christ's birthday, the time of the Yunnan uprising. Songs and cheers rise in great gatherings, how heroic the spirit is. Waiting to organize a majestic array, first look at Wang Zheng's flag. The old nation has a new destiny, the direct path sees the people's customs. Foretelling the signs of restoration, first recite the triumphant words. How to comfort hunger and thirst, deep longing is the most.

### A Bet

— Cao Mengyu

No matter who it is, no matter what they are dealing with, they always hope for victory and worry about failure. Crying and having nervous breakdowns because of failure is very common. There is almost never a case of crying and having a nervous breakdown because of victory. However, there is an exception. In the past year, A was worried about winning the bet he made with B on New Year's Day last year. Losing a table of dinner only costs a dozen dollars, which is very limited, and his spirit can gain great comfort in return. If he were to win, even if B treated him to a table of dinner, he wouldn't be able to eat it. He would be in pain and have a nervous breakdown.

Since the national crisis became severe, both A and B have never stopped hoping for the resolution of the national crisis. However, in reality, it is the opposite of their hope every day, and the national crisis is becoming more and more serious! B's vision is slightly higher than A's, and he is more optimistic about things. He does not consider resolving the national crisis to be hopeless. A is not like that. In recent years, he has felt that the hope of resolving the national crisis is becoming increasingly slim. Last New Year's Day, A and B argued for a long time about whether there was hope or not, and the result was the bet.

How to bet? The period is one year. If there is hope of resolving the national crisis, and it must be quite obvious, not theoretical deductions, but to be considered hopeful in the intuition of the people, then A loses to B and is fined a table of dinner. They would decide who won and who lost based on the internal situation and foreign policy over the past year on New Year's Day this year.

In the past year, A was constantly worried about winning. He prayed for failure and hoped for B's victory, so that he could only sacrifice limited money in exchange for the greatest spiritual comfort. In the first half of the year, he still felt that his request for failure was very slim. Later, it was like bitterness turning to sweetness. The situation changed day by day. He was so happy that he was almost going crazy. He had already prepared the cost of a table of dinner and planned to invite a few more friends on New Year's Day to have a good feast.

Early in the morning, A just got up when B ran to A's house and said, "How about the bet from this day last year?" A said, "Who would forget? I will definitely treat you today!" B said, "Knowing that you would treat me, I got up early to ask you to send the cost of a table of dinner to the organization that collects donations for the relief front."

"That's right! That's right!" A was even more elated. (Manuscript fee for Sui relief)

### Mahjong Has Japan

— Jiyun

Cafes, mahjong parlors, and pachinko halls are the most popular pastimes in Japan. You can find these places in any back alley or small street. Many people believe that Japanese people only play cards for the sake of winning or losing, and not for gambling, making it a purely recreational activity. This is more meaningful than our country's gambling practices that lead to financial ruin. However, there are also instances where Japanese people gamble secretly while playing cards. Yokohama is the only gambling den in Japan and it has become an open secret. Tokyo has very strict regulations against gambling, but Japanese people never tire of it. Those who neglect their proper work and spend their time with mahjong may not necessarily conform to the diligent and thrifty national character of Japan.

In fact, the mahjong craze in Japan has become a widespread phenomenon, especially among shop clerks, laborers, students, and bosses. From three or four o'clock in the afternoon until late at night, the mahjong parlors are always full. Cafes are the main stronghold for selling beer, and mahjong parlors are the main stronghold for selling cigarettes. As soon as you step through the door of a mahjong parlor, you can see a room full of people, the sound of tiles clacking, and the air filled with smoke, like a fog. This time, Japan increased the tax on cigarettes to use the extra 30 million in revenue to expand its military, so the contribution of mahjong parlors is no small matter.

The original mahjong tiles were a form of entertainment for Chinese expatriates, and they only attracted the attention of the Japanese after they became popular in the United States. Therefore, many of the mahjong tiles in the past were imported from China. Later, due to high tariffs and the fact that Japan could also manufacture them, the import of Chinese mahjong tiles has almost disappeared. However, specialized Shanghai companies that sell them have made a fortune. Mahjong tiles made in Japan, mainly in Osaka, are mostly made of ox bone, which is cheaper than those in China. There are also those made of artificial ivory, such as whale bone, which are even cheaper. However, the polishing and carving are far inferior to those in China. The names of mahjong parlors, such as Zhulin Zhuang, Juxian Zhuang, and Yile Zhuang, are all copied from China. The pronunciations of "pong," "chow," "three elements," and "four joys" are also the same as in China. It is unexpected that mahjong tiles have spread the Chinese language to Japan. The layout of mahjong parlors is very similar to cafes and pachinko halls, with large "Zhong, Fa, Bai" characters painted on the windows as trademarks. There are also signs that say, "This parlor has full ivory Chinese mahjong tiles and does not charge extra."

In a small room, besides the chairs and tables, there is no room to move. The gamblers are shouting and cheering, and one foot is already on the chair. There are also people who play mahjong at home in Japan, using very low tables and kneeling on the ground. Playing a round of cards costs 30 to 50 cents, and the parlor owner provides tea or cigarettes, with the expenses borne by the loser. There are many scoring charts pasted on the wall, all produced by Shanghai companies, with diagrams explaining the names of "three elements," "four joys," and "pure terminals." Indeed, mahjong has become scientific in Japan as well, and there are also many famous scholars researching and writing about it. The calculation of wins and losses is done with bone chips, which are not as refined as the chips in China. The one and four dots on the dice are red, the two and six dots are black, and the three and five dots are green, which is also different from China. It is not only that mahjong is so popular in Japan, but also that on foreign ships with more Chinese and Japanese passengers, mahjong tiles are provided in the second and third class cabins for passengers to pass the time.

### The Prerequisites for Tuberculosis Prevention in Our Country

— Ding Huikang

Speech manuscript for the Shanghai Tuberculosis Prevention Exhibition

The China Tuberculosis Prevention Association recently held the Shanghai Tuberculosis Prevention Exhibition at the Wuzhou Pharmacy. Many people went to see it, which shows that people in society have a deep concern and understanding of the issue of tuberculosis prevention. The scope of tuberculosis prevention work is very broad. Even in the current situation in various countries, although the mortality rate of tuberculosis has decreased due to advances in medical treatment, the danger of its transmission has not decreased. For example, Germany's latest regulations on tuberculosis prevention have not yet been distributed, while Norway forces patients to be admitted to hospitals for treatment, which is a good way to address the root of the problem. Given the complexity of the current situation in our country, it is very difficult to carry out tuberculosis prevention work. Even people in the medical field feel helpless. However, based on the severity of the actual situation, it is essential for the whole country to work together to overcome the difficulties. Here are my preliminary views on the prerequisites for tuberculosis prevention in our country and their implementation methods.

㊀ The medical community has an obligation to report

The medical community is at the forefront of tuberculosis prevention work and should have an obligation to report tuberculosis patients. In this way, it will not be difficult to obtain statistics on lung diseases within a certain period of time. In other words, severe patients (i.e., those who pose a risk of transmission) can be clearly counted after reporting is implemented.

㊁ Implement group X-ray examinations

Pulmonary tuberculosis is an infectious disease. All public places, such as factories, schools, and companies, should be given group X-ray examinations to identify and isolate those with the disease. In this way, the risk of transmission can be reduced. This should be done in cooperation with various public organizations and hospitals. Even ordinary residents who consider themselves healthy should have an X-ray examination once a year by a doctor. Those in an environment with a risk of tuberculosis transmission should pay particular attention.

㊂ Implement tuberculosis clearance

All patients with open tuberculosis should be forced to be hospitalized for treatment, and their homes should be disinfected. This is the most thorough way to address the root of the problem. The authorities should investigate in advance whether the number of hospital beds in the city is sufficient. Given the current situation in our country, the construction of sanatoriums is also an urgent matter. However, whether the construction should adopt a general hospital system, a village system, or a mixed system is still a question.

㊃ Improve treatment

According to current treatment methods, natural therapy and consolidation surgery are the most important. More importantly, early diagnosis is essential. Therefore, lung disease treatment centers should be established in various places, with X-ray and artificial pneumothorax equipment, not only for the early diagnosis of the general public, but also for the use of practicing physicians in the city.

㊄ Research on tuberculosis drugs

According to various countries, no tuberculosis drugs have been invented, but our country has many, and at the same time, our country has many tuberculosis patients. What is the crux of the matter? I feel that there is a need for research. Generally speaking, people prefer the convenience of taking medicine, and dislike the trouble of seeing a doctor. However, if they only see a doctor after the medicine is ineffective, not only do they lose their individual "proper treatment period," but the degree of transmission risk also increases invisibly several times, which is a serious problem in tuberculosis prevention work.

㊅ Improve public health

This issue has a very broad scope and should be studied by experts. However, in our social situation, the most important thing is to prohibit spitting. This issue should be promoted with all our strength. All public institutions and entertainment venues, tickets, and advertisements, etc., must have very clear text slogans and pictures to make people startling and no longer spit. In about one or two years, we may be able to achieve the goal, and its effectiveness can at least reduce the degree of transmission risk, which is also extremely important for tuberculosis prevention work.

㊆ Pay attention to eugenics

This issue also needs to be studied by experts. Whether tuberculosis is hereditary is still under research. For example, the Koch Institute in Berlin is raising 3,400 mice to study this hereditary issue. Leaving that aside for the moment, in terms of the marriage of tuberculosis patients, it not only has a great impact on their personal health, but also has a very high risk of transmission to the other party and their children. This is an inevitable fact. Therefore, from the standpoint of tuberculosis prevention, before marriage, both parties should ask a doctor to check the health of their lungs, and then the authorities can issue a marriage certificate.

㊇ Tuberculosis prevention museums and exhibitions

It is undeniable that there are many illiterate people in our country. In addition, people in society have shallow knowledge. If we only use written publicity, it will be difficult to achieve results. We should establish more tuberculosis prevention museums and exhibitions. All aspects of tuberculosis, such as the causes of the disease, the routes of transmission, pathological changes, changes in X-ray images, treatment methods, attention to daily life, and various statistics, should be displayed with pictures and specimens to make it clear to the viewer and deeply understand the risk of transmission and the proper treatment methods. The results will be considerable.

㊈ Organize disease insurance

The soundness of this organization method is directly proportional to the degree of development of a country's medicine. In our country's social situation, many sick families cannot afford medical treatment, and doctors do not have fixed jobs, which makes it impossible to guarantee their livelihoods. Most hospitals have too high incomes and must rely on subsidies from public and charitable organizations. Specialized research institutes and complete graduate schools are even more unable to develop, so it is very difficult to seek progress. Moreover, medicine is a noble and positive construction undertaking. Even with the country's financial resources, it may be difficult to maintain it. To break through this difficult hurdle, we can only promote the disease insurance business. It should be organized by the people of the whole country, the government, and specialized insurance agencies in close cooperation, so that the people have medical security, doctors have considerable work income, and hospitals have reliable recurring expenses. Then, all medical construction will have positive development. In terms of tuberculosis prevention, if disease insurance can be fully popularized, then the people will have the possibility of early diagnosis and proper treatment, and specialized sanatoriums and research institutes can be established in order. Not only can the development of medicine be expected, but also the difficult problems of tuberculosis prevention work can be solved by more than half.

The above sections seem plain and unremarkable, but in practice, their implementation requires not only huge economic backing, but also considerable time and the efforts of specialized personnel to establish a strong connection between social people, practicing physicians, university hospitals, and health agencies, and then can achieve great results. This is something to be hoped for from joint efforts!

### National Movement for Tuberculosis Prevention in Japan

— Meixian (Sent from Tokyo)

In recent years, Japan has also recognized the fearsomeness of tuberculosis and the annual increase in tuberculosis mortality, and the entire country has been frantically devoting itself to the eradication and prevention of tuberculosis. The Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs has also advertised "World Tuberculosis Country" and "Tuberculosis is a National Disease," advocating a "National Movement for Tuberculosis Prevention."

The Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs divided the national prefectures into several districts and, from October 20th of this year to January of next year, spared no expense to implement the "National Movement for Tuberculosis Prevention." From the first to sixth districts, tuberculosis prevention exhibitions were held, and various methods were implemented to promote tuberculosis prevention knowledge, with the location of the meetings as the center. In addition, tuberculosis prevention propaganda films were produced, subsidies and awards were given to tuberculosis prevention undertakings, lectures and symposiums were held, temporary health consultation centers and tuberculosis prevention committees were established, slogans were posted, a "Tuberculosis Prevention Week" was designated, and health reading materials and other printed materials on tuberculosis prevention were distributed, which was a great event. Not only is the government vigorously promoting and implementing it, but the people of Japan are also enthusiastically following and implementing it, which is indeed embarrassing for us to see.

The Tokyo Tuberculosis Prevention Exhibition was held for two weeks at the Science Museum Annex, and more than 100,000 people visited it. The displays were dazzling and included living physiological and pathological specimens and models, red, green, and green tuberculosis statistics charts and drawings, eye-catching electrical devices, and realistic moving models, from the causes of tuberculosis to prevention, and from the diagnosis and diagnosis of tuberculosis to treatment. The meeting place was annexed to the Tokyo Imperial University School of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, and the Tokyo Dental Medical Association, which served as health consultation centers. If you feel that you have a bit of tuberculosis suspicion, you can go for a free examination. Not only that, but you can also enjoy free X-ray examinations at the same time. If you have free time, you can also watch medical movies and listen to lectures, so anyone who can visit once will definitely get a wealth of tuberculosis prevention knowledge.

The estimated number of tuberculosis patients in Japan is about 130,000. If calculated based on the Japanese population, no more than one in fifty people has tuberculosis, and one in ten households has a tuberculosis patient. If we observe the main cause of death among Japanese youth (15 to 29 years old), 46.48% die from tuberculosis. The annual loss to Japan due to tuberculosis, calculated at a cost of one yuan per day for the treatment of each tuberculosis patient, is as high as 470 million yuan, compared with the loss due to national fires in Japan the year before, which was only 170 million yuan (Japan suffers huge losses from fires and wind disasters every year), which is also surprising!

Japan currently has 116 tuberculosis prevention (health) consultation centers. If calculated based on the standard of one consultation center for every 50,000 people, the United States has one consultation center for every 29,000 people, Germany has one for every 47,000 people, and Japan only has one for every 620,000 people. The total number of beds in tuberculosis treatment hospitals in Japan is 4,110. If calculated based on the standard of 100 tuberculosis beds for every 100 deaths, Germany has 115 beds, the United States has 112 beds, and Japan only has 10 beds. Therefore, if Japan's tuberculosis prevention social facilities are compared with those in Europe and the United States, it is still surprising. However, Japan is actively working and plans to have 611 consultation centers and 31,650 tuberculosis beds in ten years, so that the entire Japanese people can enjoy the benefits of tuberculosis prevention.

Since Dr. Robert Koch discovered tuberculosis bacilli more than fifty years ago, the rulers and scholars of all countries in the world have been painstakingly and vigorously trying to eradicate and prevent tuberculosis. As a result, the annual tuberculosis mortality rate has decreased significantly. For example, in the United Kingdom forty years ago (1890), the mortality rate from tuberculosis was 23.2 per 10,000 people (of which pulmonary tuberculosis accounted for 16.4 people), but by 1933, the tuberculosis mortality rate had decreased to 8.2 people (those who died from pulmonary tuberculosis accounted for 6.8 people). In Germany, in 1924, 12.0 people per 10,000 residents died from tuberculosis, but by 1932, it had decreased to 7.5 people. Considering the prevalence of tuberculosis in our country, and that tuberculosis prevention work has always been ignored by the general public, how can we not feel a chill! In recent years, only Mayor Wu and others have initiated the China Tuberculosis Prevention Association and established several clinics, but tuberculosis prevention work is related to the health of the entire nation, and it is hoped that the whole country will work together!

### The Prevention of Colds in Children and Home Precautions (Part Two)

— (Medical Doctorate) Hiroshi Goshima, Translated by Shouzhen Li

To enable children to be healthy enough to prevent colds, first of all, do not let them wear too many clothes. Wearing thick clothes should only be limited to

## Page 24

so-called weak children. However, wearing too much clothing easily leads to sweating, and feeling cold after sweating can lead to catching a cold, so it is very important to have the habit of wearing less. With this habit, wearing too much at once not only hinders their exercise but also weakens their development and resistance. From this point of view, this is very important. Furthermore, because wearing too much makes one hunch over, the skin is not toughened, and resistance will naturally be weak. Therefore, to make the skin resistant, one should not wear too much and should keep clean. For bathing, the water temperature should not be too hot. As for the indoor temperature to pay attention to, it should not be too warm. Getting used to living in a warm house is not a good thing. On the contrary, there are very few cases of colds in cold homes because it is easy to catch a cold when going from a warm place to a slightly colder place.

Is it necessary to keep the indoor temperature above sixty degrees? It is best not to think about such things. It is common to see extreme people who even close the small windows on top of the doors (air windows), filling the room with carbon dioxide, which is very bad. Even if one has pneumonia, one should not close the room tightly. It is best to keep the temperature relatively high and with few changes. Sometimes, pneumonia is stimulated by cold air, which can be beneficial.

Since the year before last, the Chiba Medical University and the Akabane Infant Home have opened their windows for so-called "open-air therapy," and the results are said to be excellent, which is worth noting. In general families, paying too much attention to temperature is harmful. Do not think that cold air is more harmful; cold air is more beneficial to the body than warm air.

Secondly, although they are children, one must pay attention to their age. Newborn babies need to be kept warm because their skin is not yet accustomed to the outside world, so be sure to keep a hot water bag or "warm water bottle" next to them to keep them warm. Special attention should be paid to infants. If they do not eat, check to see if they are cold. Often, putting one or two hot water bags next to them will help.

During cold weather, such warming measures cannot be ignored. Even for infants, after one or two months, they should still be accustomed to wearing less. Attention should also be paid to the swaddling period. What to wear and how much to wear is difficult to say in general, but it is best if it suits the health of the infant.

When a child has a cold, home remedies should not involve just worrying about a fever and randomly using antipyretics, as this is not good and should be carefully noted. In some cases, giving antipyretics to reduce fever may lead to the occurrence of diphtheria or pneumonia. Hesitation may lead to delays that cannot be remedied, so do not use antipyretics too casually!

At the same time, regarding health methods for school-age children during winter vacation, outdoor exercise is quite good. If possible, mountain climbing and enjoying ultraviolet rays at the seaside are also excellent. Because there are very few ultraviolet rays in the city in winter, going to a place with snow and ultraviolet rays is most effective, I think. Playing in the snow is also good. In some foreign countries, children are allowed to play naked in the snow.

Regarding children's diet, children in the city are only tall and thin, not fat and heavy, while children in the countryside who eat coarse food are often heavier. This is because they are given more food than necessary—that is, too much. If you don't understand this, I think it is best not to give them too much delicious food. In wealthy families, allowing children to choose from delicacies is the most unfortunate thing. It is better to get used to simple meals so that everything tastes good. Give them plenty of food, and one or two snacks a day is sufficient. For vitamins, cod liver oil can prevent colds, which goes without saying. In addition, the amount and presence of enzymes are also effective, but it is not enough to just trust something because it is said to be beneficial.

I have already talked about the prevention of colds and precautions at home. If you think it is a cold, wrap a damp cloth around the throat (the so-called damp cloth therapy), do not go out, and do not enter public places. If the fever continues for more than two days, you should consult a doctor.

In terms of recent shock therapy, it seems more effective than stimulation therapy when the illness is mild, but this must be discussed with a doctor. Complications of otitis media, which are often caused by colds, must also be paid attention to! (The End)

### A General Overview of the Nursing Profession in Our Country

— Lingdong Li

In 1884, the year before Sun Yat-sen entered the Guangzhou Medical School, Ms. Miss, a British Jesuit nurse, came to China, which marked the beginning of the nursing profession in Chinese society. At that time, nurses did not need to have advanced knowledge or undergo rigorous training in schools. Most of them were religious followers or their children, who simply helped doctors with their busy medical work to earn a living. Therefore, the nursing profession did not have a good foundation when it first came to Chinese society, and it did not give people a good impression. No wonder the nursing profession is despised and looked down upon by the public today, and society has an incorrect understanding of the nursing profession.

Later, in 1887, Dr. Hoone, feeling that nurses lacked knowledge of medical technology and often made mistakes in their work, realized the necessity of training nurses. He then established a nursing school in Shanghai, recruiting young men and women who aspired to the nursing profession. This was the first step in establishing a prototype of a nursing school in China. After this advocacy, nursing schools were established one after another, which can be said to have been very prosperous for a time. However, although nursing schools ostensibly raised the banner of schools, in essence, they were still attached to hospitals. The academic level of nurses was low, and all the equipment was the same as before. Nurses were still regarded as the most economical labor force in hospitals, and the schools were not established to educate nurses. This was merely a nominal existence, and the nursing profession was still wandering in the dark.

It was not until the summer of 1909 that a new course was charted in the history of the nursing profession with the establishment of the Chinese Nurses Association, marking a new era of administrative organization for the Chinese nursing profession. The association published nursing journals, registered nursing schools, held examinations, compiled curricula, and revised teaching materials. By 1935, there were 164 registered schools and more than 4,000 diplomas issued. However, the reality was often the opposite, which was regrettable. Nine out of ten of the schools registered by the Chinese Nurses Association belonged to church hospital nursing schools, and the compiled curricula and teaching materials were mostly copied from abroad and could not adapt to the situation and social background of China, nor meet the actual needs of Chinese society. At the same time, the administrative power of the Chinese Nurses Association was secretly monopolized by foreigners, and it had no ability to control nursing schools nationwide. In 1936, it was changed to the Chinese Nursing Association, a private academic organization.

Since the spring of 1935, the government, recognizing the need to promote the nursing profession, established the Nursing Education Committee under the Ministry of Education to promote nursing education in China with the power of national administration. The first step was to inspect the status of nursing education in various places, starting with Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, followed by nursing schools in Shandong, Hebei, and other provinces. The results of the inspection revealed the following actual situation of nursing education:

㊀ Schools recruited students mainly to provide nursing work in hospitals, which could reduce expenses. The purpose of their training was only to meet the needs of the hospital and could not meet the needs of society.

㊁ Schools generally lacked teachers. Most of the current teachers were doctors or nurses who also worked in the hospital. Because they were busy with medical affairs, they often neglected teaching. Furthermore, the implementation of moral education in each school often lacked responsible personnel.

㊂ The teaching materials or textbooks used in each school were mostly outdated and inapplicable.

㊃ The implementation of training in each school was mostly similar to an apprenticeship system. The courses were mostly related to hospital practice. Other courses, such as civics, Chinese language, public health, and sociology, were considered unnecessary.

㊄ Schools lacked guaranteed funding, and all equipment was noticeably simple. In January 1936, the Ministry of Health conducted a national nurse registration and issued certificates. The Ministry of Education then promulgated the Provisional Regulations for Nurses and the Standard Curriculum Outline for Nurses. In March of the same year, the Ministry of Education established a nurse teacher training class, held annually, as a prelude to reforming nursing education, and established nurse school registration and a curriculum committee to compile and review various nursing teaching materials. The nursing schools that have now been registered with the Ministry of Education are as follows:

㊀ Zhenjiang Hongren Senior Vocational Nursing School, Jiangsu.

㊁ Wuxian Boxi Senior Vocational Nursing School, Jiangsu.

㊂ Wuxing Gospel Senior Vocational Nursing School, Zhejiang.

㊃ Yinxian Huamei Senior Vocational Nursing School, Zhejiang.

㊄ Nanchang Zhenyi Senior Vocational Nursing School, Jiangxi.

㊅ Changsha Renshu Senior Vocational Nursing School, Hunan.

㊆ Xiangya Medical College Affiliated Senior Vocational Nursing School, Hunan.

㊇ Putian St. Luke's Hospital Affiliated Senior Vocational Nursing School, Fujian.

From this perspective, the nursing profession in China is developing day by day. Since the development of public health nursing, the scope of the nursing profession has expanded beyond the hospital ward and into society. In 1934, the first class of public health nurses from the Ministry of Health graduated, and continuing training has now reached the seventh class. Public health nurses can be found everywhere in society, from Xinjiang and Gansu in the north, Sichuan and Shaanxi in the west, to Yunnan and Guizhou in the south. The development of public health nurses is progressing rapidly.

At the current stage, the training places for nurses in Chinese society are: ㊀ In the field of public health nurses: such as the Public Health Nurse Training Class of the Ministry of Health in Nanjing, the Public Health Nurse Teacher Training Class of the Ministry of Education, the Rural Public Health Nurse Research Class in Dingxian, Hebei, and the Public Health Nurse Training Class of Peking Union Medical College. ㊁ In the field of nurse teachers: the Nurse Teacher Training Class of the Ministry of Education, and the Shanghai Joint Nurse Teacher Training Class of the Chinese Nursing Association.

Regarding publications for nurses: the Ministry of Education's "Medical Education" monthly, the Ministry of Health's "Public Health" monthly, the Chinese Public Health Nurse Association's "Public Health Nurse Monthly," the Zhenjiang Hongren Senior Vocational Nursing School's "Nurse Weekly," published weekly in the "Jiangsu Provincial Newspaper" in the provincial capital, the Chinese Nursing Association's "Chinese Nursing Quarterly," and the Chinese Male Nurse Improvement Society's "Lifeline."

Regarding the organization of nurse academic groups, there are the Chinese Public Health Nurse Association, the Chinese Nursing Association, the Chinese Male Nurse Improvement Society, and other organizations, which are emerging like mushrooms after rain.

In summary, this is a general overview of the history of the nursing profession in China. Whether the nursing profession in the future can transition from the dark ages to a bright period and achieve the ideal of a healthy Chinese nursing profession depends on whether the pioneers in the Chinese medical and nursing fields have the courage, perseverance, and great vision to plan for the prosperity of the Chinese nursing profession.

### Talking About Cancer (1)

— Xiaozu

Since the former party and state elder Hu Hanmin suffered from high blood pressure, people who have enough to eat and less to do have also begun to suspect that they have high blood pressure. Everyone is paying attention to having doctors carefully measure their blood pressure as a precaution. Society has unconsciously gained a common sense of hygiene. Following this symptom, another condition that has attracted people's attention and vision is liver cancer. This is the demon that recently took the life of Huang Yongbai, a prominent figure in military and political circles and a famous diplomat. People who are not forgetful should also remember that Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the revolutionary leader and party and state hero, also had his precious life taken by liver cancer before the revolution succeeded. Although it seems logical that great people suffer from great illnesses, it is not something to be hoped for. From commoners to the upper classes, prospective dignitaries, and so on, the number of people who die from liver cancer or other cancers in a year is unknown. It is only that they have not attracted people's attention and vision. Illness makes people prominent! It is the luck or misfortune of cancer. Just when Mr. Huang was diagnosed, the empty debate and written arguments between Chinese and Western doctors over the diagnosis and treatment were truly lively and wonderful. Unfortunately, medicine was ineffective, and Committee Member Huang eventually died of the disease, leaving behind only a diagnosis of liver cancer. The prediction that there might be a turning point or even a cure after another period of time has no chance to be proven. Afterwards, large and small newspapers recorded the details of Mr. Huang's diagnosis and treatment in lengthy articles. The ultimate cause of Mr. Huang's death is not to be discussed here. I am also good at following trends and joining in the fun. I feel that the knowledge and learning of these gentlemen, which can be gleaned from the debate between Chinese and Western doctors caused by Mr. Huang's illness (according to the statement, it is a news advertisement), is truly outstanding, making it impossible for people to easily express their opinions. At the same time, I feel that it is necessary to instill more fully the general common sense of medicine in society. At least, people should know what cancer is and what to do if they have cancer, so that patients will not be at a loss and doctors will not engage in empty debates without regard to the actual situation, or even blame each other. What I find even more incomprehensible is why the diagnosis of liver cancer was only confirmed after the autopsy. In the long period of time that passed, I did not hear a suspected diagnosis of liver cancer. It should be known that true liver cancer is not a rare disease in our Orient, as Westerners call it, unlike what is stated in Western textbooks. In the West, that is, in Europe, it is indeed a rare disease. Mr. Nagayo of Japan has a detailed statistic that can be used as a reference. Motivated by these reasons, I dare not decline to attempt a popular article on cancer. I remember finding similar works in the medical special publication of the Dagong Daily, but I think readers will not dislike it if I do it again! In order to make it easier for readers to understand, the various issues are listed in order as follows.

㊀ What is called cancer, and what is cancer like? Is it a thing?

㊁ What is the anatomical structure of cancer, and how many types of cancer are there?

㊂ What is the physiological function of cancer?

㊃ What are the current theories about the causes of cancer?

㊄ How does cancer grow?

㊅ Where does cancer grow?

㊆ What are the signs of cancer growth and development?

㊇ How can you determine that the wart that has grown is cancer?

㊈ What kind of effect does cancer have on the body, and how does it cause harm?

㊉ Why is cancer such a tricky disease?

㊉㊀ What are the treatment options for cancer?

㊉㊁ What significant progress has been made in cancer research in recent years?

To begin with, we must first know that cancer is a type of malignant tumor. Malignant tumors are generally divided into two major systems: one is the connective tissue system, called sarcoma (Sarkorna), and the other is the epithelial cell system, called carcinoma (Carclnon). This is the material we are discussing now.

### January 5th, National Calendar

— Me

Today is January 5th of the national calendar. From January 2nd, the newspaper was closed for three days as usual. During these three days, I did not meet with readers, and I was really missing you very much. I am really sorry. In another way of saying it, the newspaper of New Year's Day in the national calendar was compiled on December 31st of last year, so it has been a year since I met with readers today. Today's supplement is the first day of this year, so it can be said that this is the first time I have met with readers this year. Congratulations, congratulations. Today, I should make up for a congratulatory message.

During these three days, I don’t know how busy you readers were, how you spent your time, and how happy you were. I heard that this year’s New Year’s Day in the national calendar was more elegant and interesting than in previous years. Not only were all the theaters, dance halls, movie theaters, and amusement parks full, but also all kinds of large and small restaurants were full of people. This situation, it is said, is not only unprecedented in previous years, but also probably the first time since 1936.

What is the reason for this? The reason is very simple. First, last year there was a bumper harvest throughout the country, and there were very few areas with disasters. The economic power of the people was slightly more active, so all industries were able to benefit from it, and everyone had a thriving outlook. Second, the civil war has disappeared, and the suppression of the communists has also been successful. Even if there are still Zhu and Mao in the northwest, they are at the end of their rope, and the period of elimination is not far away. In Suiyuan, the recovery of Bailingmiao is also a great feat in history, and it is not impossible to recover lost territory and restore the peace of the rebels. Third, President Chiang Kai-shek escaped danger and returned to the south, receiving great comfort from this great shock. The degree of excitement among the people has naturally increased even more. With these three reasons, this year's New Year's Day in the national calendar is even more joyful.

But this kind of enthusiastic situation only shows that the Chinese nation really has the hope of revival and the foundation of revival, and it cannot be said that it has already succeeded. If we want to achieve the goal of success, we must have a considerable period of time and considerable effort. Not only must the government make efforts, but the people must also make efforts, because a country is no different from a family. If parents want to revitalize their family, work hard, but the children are arrogant, extravagant, and indulgent, and specialize in playing, this kind of family, no matter how capable and diligent the head of the family is, will never get the good result of prosperity. Therefore, I hope that from 1937, everyone will come again to be a person, raise up and help up the country of the Republic of China, and make the four characters of revitalizing the nation the first responsibility on everyone's shoulders.

### "Year of Peace"

— Mengruo

1936, which was called a crisis, has passed in turmoil, which cannot but be said to be a great happiness for all mankind! Now the old year is coming to an end, and the new year is unfolding before our eyes. In addition to rejoicing and cheering, everyone is primarily concerned with what kind of year it will be this year!

British Prime Minister Baldwin said in a eulogy on New Year's Day: "Although there are many problems that can disturb and threaten world peace, I firmly believe that 1937 will be the 'Year of Peace'." On the same day, US Acting Secretary of State Molter said: "Regarding the avoidance of all future wars, I know that people in various countries still have many doubts, but I observe the poetry bureau and assert that there will be no large-scale war in 1937, and the world is now slowly moving towards peace."

From this point of view, this year should be the "Year of Peace."

However, everyone still cannot rest easy. It is impossible to know what the basis is for the judgments of these two great politicians from Britain and the United States. But according to our observations, although the ominous 1936 has passed safely, the world crisis is still lurking and progressing with the times. Therefore, since the Second World War did not break out last year, it may be difficult to continue to maintain peace this year.

There are several objective facts that can prove this:

## Page 26

Among the international events that attracted the most attention in 1936, the formation of the left and right camps was the most important. The Franco-Russian alliance came first, and the German-Italian-Japanese alliance came later. The beginning of the contact between these opposing situations is not far away. Germany's hostility towards Soviet Russia has been clearly expressed in the past. On New Year's Day this year, Hitler said: "Bolshevism is the common enemy of mankind. Germany is responsible for safeguarding European peace and should fight against it unremittingly from now on. 1937 has arrived, and we are determined to engage in a great struggle to ensure the economic survival of the country." On the one hand, Italy also made the same statement, saying that "communism must be stopped." It can be seen that these two major camps have reached the point of drawing swords and are at risk of causing war at any time.

Secondly, the Washington Naval Treaty and the London Naval Treaty both expired at the end of the year. In the future, there will inevitably be a fierce competition among countries around the world to expand their navies. The latest news is that the United Kingdom plans to build two battleships, five cruisers, one aircraft carrier, eighteen destroyers, and six submarines. The United States is preparing to start building several 35,000-ton battleships. Italy plans to build six 50-ton submarines, and there are 24 more under construction. As for Japan, although it has not yet been announced, one can get a glimpse of it from the budget proposal for the coming year. It is not difficult to imagine what kind of situation will be created by this unrestricted competition.

Furthermore, the increasingly dangerous Spanish war also poses a major threat to world peace. Everyone knows that the Spanish civil war is a miniature of an international war. Recently, Germany, Italy, and Soviet Russia have changed from helping secretly to participating openly. If this war cannot be resolved for a day, the world will not be stable for a day.

In addition, Germany's demand for colonies, judging from the situation, Hitler is determined to get it, and it is possible to take a risky action in the near future.

Finally, let's look back at the situation in the Far East, which is especially discouraging. Although the Suiyuan war is now temporarily silent, the invasion conspiracy of those ambitious people is still intensifying, and the event is very likely to expand. Not only is there hidden concern in Suiyuan, but recently, aircraft from a certain country suddenly distributed absurd leaflets in Ping City and Qingdao. One day and night, the sea mouths of Qiyayanglin Dabanghuxu Pukou Yemaokou and other places were suddenly strafed by Japanese warships with machine guns for no reason. What is the intention of this, I'm afraid it's a New Year's greeting?

In short, everyone has the same desire for peace. Baldwin and Molter's words can be regarded as New Year's greetings, but no one dares to guarantee that this year is the "Year of Peace"!

### Winter Wind in My Hometown

— Green Frost

"In the desolate garden, a type of floating vegetable alone occupies the old-time spring of Qinhuai." These are two lines from a nostalgic poem about Jinling. Who the author is, I've already forgotten. The floating vegetable is the pickled mustard green from the Su and Chang areas. In the severe winter, when all kinds of grasses wither, edible vegetables are also very few, only the pickled mustard green is fat and thriving at this time, it is the only fine delicacy in the severe winter. Just looking at these three characters for pickled mustard green is enough to make one think of the beautiful color tone of large, fat green leaves reflecting in the pure white snow. It is said that the floating vegetable in Nanjing is even better than those in the Su and Chang areas, it melts in your mouth with a sweet taste, but it cannot be exported outside like Nanjing salted duck and dried tofu, so only the people of Nanjing value it, and the outside world doesn't know much about it.

I am not from Nanjing, and in my hometown, pickled mustard greens are also considered the only fine delicacy in winter. In addition, before winter, the main vegetable food is also a kind of large green vegetable, which is a staple food in my hometown throughout the winter. It's just that this vegetable cannot withstand frost and snow, so it is almost all harvested from the fields after the winter solstice. In my hometown, almost every household pickles this vegetable in large quantities to make salted vegetables in winter, which is enough for eating from winter to the coming spring.

The stem of the large green vegetable is particularly thick and wide, with a width of more than an inch at the end. When pickled and eaten, this section of the stem tastes the best. I thought of the scene when I was a child at home.

The north wind was blowing even harder at night. The sky was gloomy, with a hint of snow. After kicking the small ball and shuttlecock on the field outside, my mother was calling for dinner. I went home with excitement all over me. My mother was annoyed, but also lovingly, blamed us, saying:

"You play so much you forget your home".

We climbed onto the dining table, which was full of steaming hot food. A pot of chopped green vegetable stems was also placed in the middle, which my mother had just scooped out of the icy salted vegetable jar. I sent piece after piece into my mouth, hot porridge and rice, mixed with icy cold vegetable stems, my teeth were stimulated to the point of pain, and bursts of hissing sounds came from our mouths. But the pot filled with vegetable stems was already gone. It often made my mother have to cut another pot. Today, when I recall the deliciousness of those vegetable stems, I can no longer return to the scene of those years.

One evening, several of us sisters were warming our lessons under the lamp, and my mother was sewing clothes and socks for us. Mother seemed very happy to play with her childhood toys with us. She taught us a way to eat things, putting a washed big clam shell in the foot warmer, putting half a shell of salted vegetable brine, and putting a dozen or twenty soybeans in the middle. After one or two quarters of an hour, the soybeans were cooked. The taste was very bad. So we cooked and ate it every day. As for the disputes between the sisters due to unequal grabbing of food, and the crying of the loser, then the mother scolded us in a tone of blaming herself:

"I shouldn't have taught you these things, you little treasures"!

Listening to the tight winter wind, sweeping over the roof, hitting the windows, making rustling sounds. We were cooking soybeans to eat, preparing for tomorrow's lessons, forgetting the severe cold outside, the room was our small world, and mother was the master of everything, lovingly isolating us from the severe winter, living in the warm spring breeze.

As the years grew, they finally drove me from the warm spring breeze to a foreign land. The life of grabbing soybeans to eat with my sisters when I was young can no longer be retrieved from my life. Sometimes when I go home, I have repeatedly wanted to rearrange the life of that year, and cook soybeans with my young brothers and sisters, just like in front of my mother, but I feel that this is ultimately a fake play. I have tried my best to find out why the scene of that year cannot be reproduced again now? In life, it turns out that I have been stabbed with pain all over my body! Looking at my mother's face, the wrinkles on her forehead are getting deeper and deeper, although she still loves us the same, but the kind of enthusiasm of the young mother in the past is now much worse in comparison. She has also fallen into the sores of a painful life, and the children cannot give her some warm comfort in her old age.

Listening to the tighter north wind sweeping over my roof night after night. I thought of this north wind more than ten years ago, sweeping over the roof of my hometown. Now I have been driven into a different life. I couldn't help but feel a spasm all over my body.

### Layman Jingxu

— Zheng Mingzi

Whenever Layman Jingxu walked past butcher shops and restaurants, he always felt an unusual unease slowly creeping over his heart, like a dark shadow rising in the sunlight, and this shadow could not be shaken off in the world: that cruel, tragic, unbearable shadow! The bloody bodies of livestock, the cries of dying animals, even this was enough to make Layman Jingxu, who was over fifty years old, feel inexplicable pain in his heart, even if he had forgotten that there were more cruel massacres and more unbearable baseness and suffering in the world! He dared not even think about these things! He tried several times to deny these things, and he also tried several times to deny the sorrows and tribulations of life that he had suffered for fifty years! In form, perhaps he could be said to have denied it: he calmed the emotions in his heart as if they were dead water, he hated all movement, he looked at the world and humanity with "compassionate" eyes, he focused his heart on Mahayana and Hinayana, Pure Land and Nirvana, he cursed life! He was powerless to bear it, he wanted to get out of that painful circle, wanted to jump out of the "six paths of reincarnation," but in the depths of his heart, the past and present scenes of the human world that were more cruel than "killing" constantly attacked him secretly, like nightmares in the dark night, and when he woke up, it was still a vast expanse of dark sky, without seeing a single star! As if being stabbed hard by a light needle, he was in unspeakable pain! This pain, whether in "quieting the mind and spirit" or in silently reciting the "Diamond Sutra" and the "Great Compassion Mantra," always wrapped around his wrinkled old face and white hair from the past fifty years, like a venomous snake that could not be shaken off!

However, no one would believe that the "Layman Jingxu" of thirty years ago belonged to another type: in that small hometown, he was the first to cut off his braid, and at the age of twenty, he flew out of the rotten, old world and went to the wider world outside, adding the baptism of the world and the times to the enthusiasm of his youth. He threw away the textbooks of "ten years of studying by the window," threw away the ideas of establishing a dynasty and becoming an official, changed his original name "Ze'en" to "Guoguang," transferred from a family school to a "normal school" in the city, kept short "foreign hair" on his head, regarded the restraint of his elders and the clamor of the villagers as rotten dead grass, was fascinated by Mr. Liang Qichao's political essays, and secretly discussed democracy with other young people under the Mobil kerosene lamp, discussing the invasion of foreign lands, discussing the destruction of evil forces—was it not this person who, with dark and bright eyes, a childlike voice, a youthfully ruddy face, and a strong rationality, relentlessly attacked the baseness of the human world, who is now emphasizing vegetarianism and chanting Buddha's name in Mahayana Zen Buddhism, the "Layman Jingxu"? Thirty years! What an incomprehensible trick is this? From a young man called "Guoguang" to an old layman called "Jingxu," there is something a bit incomprehensible in between—but aren't people animals with limited tolerance? For thirty years, he wandered in a difficult environment, spending a long series of endless autumns and winters in a place without sunlight. Then, the old people left him, and he could no longer see the face of his hometown, and his youth was gradually worn away in the torture of hell! Then, it is said that the world has changed its face—no, when he saw the sun again after ten years of isolation, he was at a loss, wasn't the cruelty of the human world still like a stubborn tumor? And the sun in his rationality, the light and heat in his ideals, what about the price of ten years of suffering? No, he has become so unfamiliar with the world, and the world treats him even more indifferently! In his heart, a spiritual sun is gradually darkening, and the suffering of the human world constantly襲来 like a rainstorm attacking an old and decaying house... In the years that followed, he gained achievements and fame from the struggle of life, but for him, that was an incalculable loss! This loss is only known to himself: to the world, to himself, he has completely lost his strength and lost his youth!

Thirty years ago, he was a companion of the times, but thirty years later, he became an enemy of the times! Layman Jingxu always considered it an advancement of his views. "I was also a revolutionary thirty years ago!" Wasn't he often jokingly saying that to the young people around the age of twenty?! Perhaps he would feel a little twilight; but the times only responded with a bitter smile! He was living in this suffering world "as if his breath was as thin as a thread."

He has arrived at Xiaoxiang Pavilion. The girl is, just finishing her poem and putting down her pen. The maid suddenly reports that the second master has arrived. I see him, dressed differently than in the past. Brother Bao, why are you imitating the shape of a fisherman? The young master heard this and hurriedly asked. Is my sister safe and peaceful? Can you take medicine? Can you eat more? Don't recite poetry these days. I am always worried. That's why I braved the rain to find out. If my sister loves this attire. I will send you a set when the day is right. Lin Daiyu replied, why do you need this? The image of the fisherman is really unworthy of her name. As she spoke, she thought to herself, she shouldn't have said fisherman. Her peach blossom face was flushed with shame, hard to hide. She silently lowered her head and did not speak. One is, unintentionally speaking wrongly. One is, not knowing what love is. The dream of the Red Chamber is full of changes. Let me tell that, a section of Xiaoxiang asking about illness. I hate the old man under the moon for not pulling the thread of love. Therefore, medicine is always ineffective. In vain, both sides are sincere.

The affairs of the world are like a game of chess on a board. The wind and snow change, sighing at the floating dust. Since ancient times, how many infatuated people have there been? Having read through the vicissitudes of life, I feel the past and the present. I think I am, with a chivalrous heart and arrogant bones. Wandering the rivers and lakes for ten years. I sigh at my own life as an ephemeral being. I am used to speaking out injustice in the dusty world. The Jiashu is, the young master is amorous and loves Fengxi. He is full of love. Before leaving, he entrusts me with the importance of love. He told me to always pay attention. Who knows that Fengxi is, a flower bud envied by wind and rain. Who will be the bell to protect the flower? I only regret that he, mistakenly entered the tiger's den and his beauty was trapped. Spring locks the heavy door and no one is seen. He lets that, tears drip and cuckoos cry, pitying the night moon. The embroidered weft quietly weeps in the dusk. Fortunately, the mother secretly sent news. Suddenly touched the hero's ears and was shocked. Therefore, he risked his life to investigate the tiger's den. He eavesdropped with his ears against the wall. I secretly saw that, the general did not change his crazy slave state. He has time, his humble attitude begged for a beauty. He also presented strings of beads and exotic toys that were dazzling. Yaqin was entrusted to mediate. Unexpectedly, the daughter loves gold. She only values gold and not love. Since ancient times, the love arena has been full of changes. Gold can buy a beauty's heart. If I had known that, the flowers in the mirror and the moon in the water were empty shadows. I shouldn't have, suspected rain and suspected clouds and pretended to be true. But I, often sigh at the situation I see. For a time, it was difficult to suppress the rising tide of anger. I wish I could, cut off this seed of love for you. Don't let down the deep trust of that year. It is lamentable that, the young master's infatuation is like a dream. The tragic consequences have changed the cause. Therefore, a letter is transmitted by mail miraculously. Suddenly, he bid farewell to his parents and started his journey. It is just as well to send a message to those who have lost their way in the arena of love.

### Excerpts from "Street Angel"

In "Street Angel," there is a lawyer named "Bao Boping" who lives upstairs in a big hotel. Zhao Dan and Wei Heling, for the sake of an injustice, want to file a lawsuit. They think that Bao Longtu used to get up in the middle of the night to give people a trial, then the lawyer "Bao Boping" must be worthy of his name and serve them. Who knew that this lawyer was not like the upright official Bao Gong, and only gave people lawsuits if they had money, so the injustice of Zhao Dan and Wei Heling could only not be sued.

Wang Jiting ran to the bathhouse to find the tycoon Feng Zhicheng because his family's adopted daughter was missing, and followed him all the way into the bath. He slipped by the pool and fell into the bath. This scene was very funny.

Zhao Huishen, a prostitute who has been down on her luck for many years, wanders the streets every night, waiting for customers. She recently filmed a scene of doing business. Huishen went to a Tianjin brothel and met a crooked-mouthed customer. It was a match made in heaven, and they succeeded at first sight. Zhao Huishen's acting skills are very calm and profound in depicting the character of such a woman.

Zhao Dan, who is known for acting in sentimental dramas, has recently changed his style and played a comedic role. The role in "Street Angel" is a lower-class physical laborer who has no opportunity to receive material civilization. His performances are full of gimmicks, making people laugh extraordinarily.

The special issue of "The Door of Flesh and Spirit" will be published before the film "The Door of Flesh and Spirit." The text and illustrations are beautiful, and each issue is sold for only five cents.

There was a fragrant kissing scene in "New Humanity" where Liang Saizhu stole a kiss from Hu Rong. Bu Wancang, who rarely shouts N.G., actually shouted N.G. three times.
