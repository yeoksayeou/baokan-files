### Japanese Consulate in Tianjin Sends Personnel to Cangxian to Investigate Smuggling and Resistance Arrest Case

Korean Resists and is Shot Dead by a Stray Bullet; Our Actions Were Completely Justified

On the morning of the 13th, someone from the Korean Residents' Association in Tianjin investigated the conflict on the 11th in Cangxian and reported to the Japanese Consulate, exaggerating the case, which caused the Japanese side to pay extreme attention to the case. A certain party received a report that the truth of the incident in Cangxian on the 11th was that two heavy-duty trucks from the Daan Trading Company and the Xinming Trading Company on Furong Street and Mingshi Street in the Japanese Concession in Tianjin were secretly transporting goods to Botou Town on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. When passing through the old city of Cangxian, they were encountered by the county police, who suspected them of transporting prohibited goods and attempted to intercept them for inspection. Six Koreans in the trucks opened fire and resisted. In a hurry, one truck got stuck in the mud, while the other truck accelerated and fled back to Tianjin to report to the Japanese Consulate. The three Koreans in the truck stuck in the mud continued to resist stubbornly. The police had no choice but to return fire. After a long confrontation, Korean Kim Eung-chan and driver Lee Jong-woo were shot dead by stray bullets, and Park Dae-joo was wounded in the leg, at which point they stopped resisting. The police then dragged out the original truck, which is currently stored at the Cangxian Police Station, awaiting inspection and seizure by the customs. The bodies of the two Koreans have been placed in coffins and are awaiting collection by the Japanese side. Park Dae-joo has been sent to the hospital for treatment. Our actions in this matter were completely justified. The authorities have ordered the Anci Commissioner to investigate the details of the disturbance in preparation for diplomatic responses.

(2) All kinds of raw materials, whether belonging to colonies or cities, are under consideration.

(3) Restrictions on supply.

(4) The timing of open door policies.

(5) The issue of supply and demand matching.

(6) The issue of substitutes.

(10) The situation arising from the rapid population growth and immigration difficulties in certain countries. The last five points will continue to be considered in the future, and the next plenary meeting will be held on June 21st. (Central News Agency, 13th, Reuters Dispatch)

[Geneva] The League of Nations Administrative Council's Raw Materials Problems Committee has been meeting here since the 8th of this month, discussing for five days. At today's meeting, it unanimously passed a report to the League of Nations Administrative Council and immediately adjourned, setting the date for the 21st of June. The main points of this report are as follows:

(1) Regarding the issue of the distribution of land producing raw materials, the committee believes it has no authority to discuss it.

(2) The committee has decided that the food problem, whether produced in colonies or non-colonies, should be discussed together with the industrial raw materials problem.

(3) The committee believes that the open-door policy and the international trade restriction system should be discussed together with the issue of restoring greater freedom to international trade, as only the restoration of greater freedom to international trade can facilitate international payments and exchange methods.

(4) Countries with surplus populations naturally require more raw materials to supply their people with food, but if these countries convert raw materials into manufactured goods and export them to foreign countries, they can obtain a large amount of foreign currency to purchase the food they need.

(5) Based on the demands of the Polish and Japanese representatives, the committee believes that if countries lacking raw materials can be given access to lands that produce raw materials, especially those that have not been fully developed, it would greatly benefit the overall solution of the raw materials problem.

In addition, the report reiterates the committee's and its subcommittees' future agenda, concluding that 'the committee is unable to determine to what extent it will be able to propose appropriate solutions to the raw materials problem in the future, but the committee is determined to continue its research to draft an outline of the needs of the countries concerned.'

### On Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation

— Zhou Xianwen

—A Message to the Japanese Economic Survey Mission—

The Sino-Japanese Trade Association will hold its first membership meeting in Shanghai on the 18th. The Japanese members attending the meeting, including Kodama Kenji and his party, are expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. Mr. Kodama and others have come all the way to China not only to attend the membership meeting of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association but also to fulfill the mission of promoting Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Therefore, the Japanese newspapers have called them an economic delegation. We cannot help but wonder what exactly is the content of the Sino-Japanese economic cooperation that Mr. Kodama and others want to promote, but according to Mr. Kodama's statement when departing from Tokyo, "the two countries should stand on the principles of respecting territorial sovereignty, mutual benefit, and equality." If that is indeed the case, then we cannot help but say a few words in addition to our sincere welcome.

First: The members of the survey mission are all leaders in the Japanese business community. They should not only have experience but also be well-versed in knowledge. They should know that the economies of China and Japan cannot be thoroughly promoted under the current production organization. This is because Japan's current economic problems are (1) how to sell industrial products and avoid overproduction, and (2) how to obtain raw materials and avoid production stagnation. Therefore, if Japan wants to cooperate thoroughly with China economically, it must first seek to have China purchase Japanese industrial products, and second, seek to have China supply Japan with raw materials. Such cooperation is clearly not mutually beneficial, let alone equal. To put it bluntly, it is to make China an economic colony of Japan, that is, on the one hand, to fulfill the responsibility of selling industrial products for Japan, and on the other hand, to bear the obligation of supplying raw materials for Japan. Recently, the Japanese representative stated at the League of Nations Raw Materials Conference that "making it easier to import raw materials into Japan is not enough to alleviate the current difficulties; it is necessary to take various measures at the same time to facilitate the international trade of industrial manufactured goods," which is indeed an honest statement. However, China naturally does not want to become an economic colony of any country, and its task in the future is to seek economic independence. There are many ways to do this, but the most important is to revitalize industry. The conditions for revitalizing industry require the abolition of all unequal treaties and the genuine implementation of tariff autonomy. Moreover, the revitalization of Chinese industry will inevitably affect the sales of Japanese industrial products. Furthermore, under the premise of revitalizing industry, China must preserve all the necessary raw materials, which will also affect Japan's access to raw materials. In short, under the current production organization, there is no way for the economies of China and Japan to cooperate thoroughly. This is not because the Chinese are deliberately anti-Japanese, nor is it because the Japanese want to invade China. This is the economic environment of the two countries under the current production organization, and there is nothing that can be done about it. We are making this frank statement to advise the members of the survey mission not to have excessive hopes for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, lest they become so hopeful that they unknowingly deviate from the original intention of mutual benefit and equality and cause unnecessary resentment.

Second: Although Sino-Japanese economies cannot be thoroughly promoted, there is still room for partial cooperation. The so-called partial cooperation is that if China has excess raw materials that Japan needs, it can give priority to supplying them to Japan, and if Japan has surplus industrial products that China needs, it can also give priority to purchasing them from Japan. In addition, the borrowing of Japanese capital and the reliance on Japanese technology can all be mutually beneficial on an equal footing. Only in this way can we accept the desire for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation held by the members of the survey mission, and we are willing to give it full consideration. We cannot know what is the scope of the Sino-Japanese economic cooperation that the members of the survey mission are referring to, but we can guess that it will not go beyond this partial cooperation. However, even for this partial cooperation, we believe that there are still preconditions at present, and we must ask the members of the survey mission to pay attention.

Third: The members of the survey mission should know that since the September 18th Incident, under the instigation of Japan, our three northeastern provinces were lost first, followed by Rehe. Furthermore, the establishment of the puppet government in eastern Hebei, the existence of the puppet army in northern Chahar, the arrogance of Japanese special service agencies in China, and the rampant smuggling by Japanese ronin in various places have made our territory incomplete and our sovereignty unable to be independent. How to restore our lost territory and sovereignty in the past is the only important and urgent task of the Chinese government and people at present. If the Chinese government and people disregard this only important and urgent task and first talk about economic cooperation with Japan, it would not only be putting the cart before the horse but simply shameless. For the sake of self-respect, the Chinese government and people are unwilling to do this. Judging from Mr. Kodama's words that the two countries should respect territorial sovereignty, I think he will not make such a request either. Therefore, while we hope that partial Sino-Japanese economic cooperation can succeed, we also believe that we must first resolve the past Sino-Japanese political issues, restore our territory, and return our sovereignty.

Fourth: Some may say that this matter is too important for the members of the survey mission to handle. The best plan at present is to start with economic cooperation based on the principles of mutual benefit and equality, and then seek to adjust the relations between the two countries, without disregarding China's lost territory and sovereignty in the past. Even if the Chinese people do not object to this view, they cannot help but have doubts. The saying that China and Japan should coexist and prosper together has been heard by the Chinese people for a long time, but the result has been the opposite. The so-called clarification of North China has been praised by Japanese people in recent years, but the terrible situation in North China is rare in other places. The Sino-Japanese economic cooperation that the members of the survey mission are referring to may be 'without any other intentions,' but the Chinese people, recalling the historical facts of the past, cannot deeply believe that it is not an expansion of the so-called clarification of North China. Therefore, in order to gain the trust of the Chinese people, you should first promote the resolution of the Sino-Japanese political issues, and then discuss the methods of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Furthermore,

Fifth: The members of the survey mission have come all the way to China this time, and our country's government and people consider them to be honored guests. However, it is difficult to gain sincere feelings over wine. We deeply hope that you will have the opportunity to carefully observe the real public opinion of China. The Chinese people have no grudges against Japan. However, at present, all our people, regardless of class, male or female, are deeply saddened by Japan's past acts of aggression and would rather be shattered than intact. You must know that the sleeping lion of East Asia has awakened. It cannot be seduced by benefits or subdued by power. In order to restore territorial sovereignty, it will not hesitate to take any action. But you should know that what the Chinese people are willing to fight for at any cost is only the integrity of their territory and the independence of their sovereignty. They have no intention of seeking revenge. The former enemy, once it abandons its acts of aggression, the Chinese people will still regard it as family and can be as friendly as before.

Sixth: The speed at which the Chinese people have awakened in recent years may, in a certain sense, be due to Japanese oppression. You have heavy responsibilities and busy schedules. It was not easy to come to China this time. Now that you have come, I hope that after carefully observing the public opinion of China, you will take the road to North China and investigate the various actions of the Japanese people in North China. You will have a clearer understanding. The group smuggling of silver has become a thing of the past, but who are the people who are massively trafficking in drugs, resisting anti-smuggling with arms, robbing customs warehouses, and forcibly occupying civilian houses? Who are the soldiers who march every three days, conduct exercises every five days, iron birds dance in the sky from time to time, and warships appear on the coast from time to time? Furthermore, who demanded that the Chinese Central Army withdraw from Chinese territory and that the Chinese Kuomintang abolish its North China party headquarters? If you can get a glimpse of the truth of these situations, you will know that the surge in anti-Japanese sentiment among the Chinese people is not accidental. You will also know that there is a necessary path to the realization of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation.

In short, we sincerely welcome you to China, and we are also willing to see the success of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation (partial). However, at present, if the Sino-Japanese political issues are not resolved, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation cannot be realized. Foreign Minister Sato recently said: "In diplomacy, one should not forget the other party." At present, the other party (China)'s only urgent task is to seek territorial integrity and sovereign independence. I hope you will not forget this. Furthermore, we deeply know the shortcomings of the Japanese people, but we also deeply know that the Japanese people have their own special strengths that other nations do not have. Because we do not want to see the two major nations of East Asia continue to fight each other to the point of mutual destruction, we love them so much that we speak frankly. Therefore, even though we know the complexity of the current situation in Japan and the difficulty of your position, we still tell you in frank and straightforward terms. (14th)

### The Principle of People's Livelihood and the Chinese Peasantry

— Zhang Yinlin

One of the most important issues in China today is:

(1) To study the facts assumed in the part of the Principle of People's Livelihood concerning the peasantry;

(2) To recognize the ideals put forward in the part of the Principle of People's Livelihood concerning the peasantry and to seek to realize them.

First, let's talk about the facts. In the third lecture of the Principle of People's Livelihood, Mr. Sun Yat-sen pointed out many important facts about the current situation of the peasantry. Analyzed, there are four items, now listed below in the original words:

(1) 'The population of China is mostly peasants, at least 80 to 90 percent.'

(2) 'Although there are no big landlords in China now, 80 to 90 percent of the peasants have no land.'

(3) Most of the agricultural products produced by the peasants 'are taken away by the landlords. ... Recently (circa 1924), our survey in the countryside showed that 60 percent goes to the landlords.'

(4) The peasants work hard all year long to harvest food, but in the end, it still goes to the landlords, so many peasants are unhappy to farm, and many fields gradually become barren and cannot produce.

Based on these facts, Mr. Sun Yat-sen believed that the peasant problem was the most serious problem in the Principle of People's Livelihood, 'If this problem cannot be solved, the problem of people's livelihood cannot be solved.' In other words, solving the problem of people's livelihood must start with solving the problem of the peasantry.

Putting aside superficial words, judging from the historical trends of the past ten years, this last will and testament of his seems to have been neglected. But among all of Sun Yat-sen's last will and testaments, this one in particular should be written as slogans, written as wall hangings, written as diagrams, written as forms, written in front of the National Government, and written to the right of anyone 'above the rank of one life.'

Naturally, when Mr. Sun Yat-sen lectured on the Principle of People's Livelihood, the cause of social investigation in China had not really begun, and his impressions based on personal observation and extensive consultation were limited. But his recognition of the seriousness of the problem was not exaggerated at all. The conclusions of China's social investigations a month ago have slightly modified the facts listed above. Regarding the number of tenant farmers in China, the most authoritative statement recently is the estimate published by Mr. Zhang Xin in 1930. According to this estimate, on average, self-cultivating farmers account for about 51.7 percent of farm households nationwide, semi-self-cultivating farmers account for 22.1 percent, and pure tenant farmers account for 26.2 percent. Pure tenant farmers and semi-tenant farmers (that is, semi-self-cultivating farmers) together account for about half of farm households. The fact that Chinese peasants account for about 80 percent of the population is still recognized by social scientists. So, even according to Zhang's estimate, pure tenant farmers and semi-tenant farmers already account for more than one-third of the entire population. As for the amount of rent, Mr. J. Lossing Buck (the husband of Pearl S. Buck, who is known for her novel 'The Good Earth') has recently conducted a 'sample' study in nine counties in the six provinces of Shanxi, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian. On average, rent accounts for about 40 percent of what tenant farmers produce, and the highest is 66.6 percent. However, these estimates are ultimately estimates that generalize from the particular. There are no precise population statistics in China at present. If there were, the conclusions obtained might be closer to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's impressions. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly study the facts assumed by Mr. Sun Yat-sen at present.

But even according to the current estimates, most of what more than one-third of the population has toiled hard for all year round has been plundered! I don't know if there is a more urgent social problem in the world.

Regarding the solution to the peasant problem, the plan proposed by Mr. Sun Yat-sen can be divided into two items:

(1) To improve agricultural technology and increase the productivity of peasants.

(2) To follow political and legal channels to achieve 'those who till the land should own it': In other words, to use peaceful means (no confiscation, no riots) to eliminate the landlord class.

The former is a scientific problem, and there are precedents in the advanced scientific countries of the West, so there is nothing to discuss. What needs to be considered most at present is:

(1) What political and legal steps should be taken to achieve those who till the land should own it?

(2) In implementation, which of these two items should come first, which should come later, or should they be done simultaneously?

Approximately half because the Three Principles of the People is an unfinished book, and half because the opportunity to solve the peasant problem was still far away from Mr. Sun Yat-sen at that time: Therefore, he had no answers to these two questions. But now that the Principle of People's Livelihood has an opportunity to be implemented, the answers to these two questions are urgently needed.

Among these two questions, the latter is especially urgent. Because, if it is believed that improving agricultural technology should come first, and the steps towards making those who till the land own it should come later: Then, it will take quite some time to improve the agricultural technology of such a large country as China, and the problem of how to make those who till the land own it may be temporarily put aside and discussed slowly later.

At present, some people seem to advocate that improving agricultural technology should come first, and the steps towards making those who till the land own it should come later. The reason is that under the current production conditions, most self-cultivating farmers cannot make ends meet: Even if we turn tenant farmers into self-cultivating farmers, they will still have to sell their land and become tenant farmers again. I cannot agree with this view. My reasons for disagreeing are as follows:

First, if most self-cultivating farmers cannot maintain their position under the current production conditions for one or two decades, how can this fact be explained: The current production conditions have existed for at least one or two decades, and self-cultivating farmers still account for 50 percent of the peasantry? If most self-cultivating farmers can barely maintain their position under the current conditions for one or two decades, then the benefits of agricultural technology improvement they will gain in one or two decades will be enough to protect their self-cultivating position.

Second, in the case that most self-cultivating farmers cannot maintain their position, from the perspective of the peasants themselves, being a self-cultivating farmer with land to sell is ultimately better than being a tenant farmer with no land to sell, just as being half full is ultimately better than being completely hungry. Because it is not possible to make people completely full, it seems unreasonable to rather let people be completely hungry.

Therefore, I believe that improving agricultural technology and the steps towards making those who till the land own it, under the national policy of the Principle of People's Livelihood, at least have the necessity of being done simultaneously: And how to make those who till the land own it has become an urgent problem at present.

As for the answer to this problem, this short essay cannot cover it, and I will wait for another day.

### Japanese Foreign Ministry Consults with Military on Peaceful Diplomacy

Minister of the Army Serves as Acting Foreign Minister to Explain; All Misunderstandings Cleared Up; Sato Withdraws Supplementary Explanation

[Tokyo] Japanese diplomacy can now easily gain the understanding and cooperation of the military, and misunderstandings have been swept away. The Foreign Ministry and military authorities have decided to maintain close contact and implement peaceful diplomacy towards China and Russia.

[Tokyo] At the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 12th, Miura Torao of the Toho-kai (Oriental Society) questioned Minister of the Army Sugiyama's views on Foreign Minister Sato's speech. Sugiyama replied that Sato's speech in the House of Representatives on the 11th meant, "If Japan has no intention of actively provoking war, then the crisis of war can be avoided." This was not a difference in perception of the current situation but merely a lack of preparedness in wording.

[Tokyo] Speaker Tomita invited Chief Secretary Ohashi to the Speaker's office at 12:20 PM on the 13th to convey the intentions of the various factions' negotiating committees regarding handling the Foreign Minister's supplementary explanation. After repeated consultations, the government also respected the opinions of the various factions and decided to promote the proceedings to allow for a smooth process. If the Diet members did not raise questions, the Foreign Minister would be asked to refrain from making an automatic statement.

[Tokyo] The House of Representatives convened a general meeting at 1:30 PM today. The general public believed that Foreign Minister Sato would make a supplementary speech today, so the spectator seats were already full. However, the Foreign Minister decided to cancel the supplementary explanation. At the start of the meeting, the committee chairman reported on the government's proposed amendments to ① the Military Relief Law and ② the Maternal and Child Protection Law. Finally, both bills were entrusted to the committee together, and the meeting adjourned at 6:26 PM.

[Tokyo] The Privy Council is paying close attention to Foreign Minister Sato's diplomatic policy, as the world believes it represents a major shift from previous diplomatic policies. With a sincere attitude, they are concerned about the new Foreign Minister's diplomatic policy and plan to select and invite the Foreign Minister to attend a Privy Council meeting during an appropriate time this month to explain his diplomatic policy. (Kyodo News, 13th)

[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Sato Naotake's two speeches have stirred up great waves in Japanese political circles, with conflicting opinions of approval and opposition. It is generally believed that Sato's speech in the House of Representatives on the 11th fundamentally changed his abstract speech on principles in the House of Peers and clearly indicated that he would continue to follow the path taken by the previous cabinet regarding all practical matters. Sato's supplementary explanation in the House of Peers yesterday was particularly disappointing to observers. Within the Hayashi cabinet, opinions on Sato's beliefs are divided. However, since Sato only limited himself to discussing abstract principles, it is not appropriate to rush to drastically opposing opinions. Prime Minister Hayashi claimed during the debate in the House of Peers yesterday that there was no difference of opinion between him and Sato. This was clearly to avoid accusations of disunity within the cabinet, so it cannot be accepted at face value. Minister of the Army Sugiyama Gen's reply yesterday stated that although Sato's explanation of the crisis lacked thoroughness in wording, his view of the current situation was the same. The nature of this statement is also the same. After consideration, Foreign Minister Sato automatically requested to make a further supplementary explanation in the House of Representatives this afternoon. However, because the Minseito and Seiyukai parties deeply feared that the smaller factions would use this opportunity to raise tough questions, which could not only cause unexpected turmoil domestically but also provoke negative influences abroad, they prevented it. Sato's speech was not held. It is rare for a Foreign Minister to add supplementary explanations to their own speeches twice in succession. Efforts are now being made to prevent the extreme right-wing Toho-kai (Oriental Society) and Kokumin Domei (National League) from submitting a motion of no confidence. It is expected that this motion can be abandoned, but even if it is submitted, it will be difficult to pass. In any case, the good impression caused by Sato's first speech abroad has gradually disappeared due to various contradictory expressions in this country. Therefore, we can have a deeper understanding of the driving force of Japanese diplomacy, and we can also be more aware of the difficulties of the Foreign Minister's position. Although Sato failed technically, we cannot help but express sympathy for his spirit. (Central News Agency, 13th)

[Moscow] Pravda comments on the Japanese new cabinet's foreign policy, stating that the Hayashi cabinet in Japan came to power under the condition that the military insists on its own opinions and threatens a military fascist coup. Its main task is to strengthen and expand the Japanese-German military and political agreement. The Diet's debate on foreign policy proves that the new government does not dare to publicly announce the truth about Japan's relations with Germany or other countries. The Diet's questioning of the government first shows the concern of all parties in Japan for Japanese-Soviet relations because they are extremely uneasy about the military's provocative policies. The Diet members who raised questions pointed out that Japan should conclude a non-interference treaty with the Soviet Union. This proves that prominent figures in Japanese political circles obviously do not know the contents of the secret Japanese-German agreement, which, according to known documents, stipulates that Japan cannot conclude such a treaty without Germany's consent. The Hayashi cabinet has no sincerity whatsoever and does not tell the people the truth about this situation. Instead, it shamelessly claims that the tension in Japanese-Soviet relations is due to the Soviet Union's lack of sincerity. Pravda continues to analyze Sato's speech, calling it "not encouraging" and saying that Sato's reply proves that he has to accept the military's decisive influence on foreign policy and that he cannot escape the Japanese-German secret agreement he inherited, which makes Japanese foreign policy dependent on Germany. The newspaper also quoted words from a recent Japanese military booklet, which stated, "First, there is a contradiction between two types of countries: one is the country that maintains the status quo, and the other is the country that changes the status quo." Commenting on Sato's flattery of Britain, the newspaper said, "When the military, the master of Japanese foreign policy, maintains this attitude, we doubt whether Sato's attempts to improve British-Japanese relations can succeed." Regarding the Hayashi cabinet's policy towards China, the newspaper believes that "the debate in the Japanese Diet did not clarify this most important issue. The actual actions in the next few months will show the policy guidelines adopted by Hayashi and Sato. At present, although the policies of the previous cabinet are unanimously condemned, it is also not possible to express premature optimism about the policies of the new cabinet." (TASS, 12th)

### Change of British Ambassador to Japan

[London] Sir Robert Craigie, the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, has been appointed as the Ambassador to Japan, succeeding Sir Robert Clive. Clive will be transferred to Belgium as Ambassador, and the current Ambassador to Belgium, Sir Esmond Ovey, has been transferred to Argentina as Ambassador and concurrently Minister to Paraguay. Sir Craigie is 53 years old and has served as Chargé d'Affaires in Sofia and Acting Ambassador in Washington. (Central News Agency, Reuter, 13th)

[Tokyo] The newly appointed British Ambassador to Japan, Robert Craigie, is 55 years old. He entered the diplomatic service in 1907 and was appointed as the First Secretary of the Embassy in the United States, and also served as Acting Ambassador to the United States. Since the London Naval Conference in January 1930, he has been the mastermind of the British delegation on the naval disarmament conference and has been very active. He also has many friends in Japanese political circles. With the inauguration of the new ambassador, it is expected that the adjustment of national relations between Britain and Japan can proceed. (Domei, 13th)

### Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Tojo, Arrives in Tokyo

[Tokyo] Lieutenant General Tojo Hideki, the new Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, arrived in Tokyo at 8:00 AM on the 13th to consult with the central military authorities on key matters. He is staying at the Mampie Hotel. At 10:00 AM on the same day, he visited Chief of the General Staff, Prince Kan'in Kotohito, to report on military affairs. He then held important consultations with Chief of the General Staff Imai and other leaders. In the afternoon, he met with Minister of the Army Sugiyama to explain the security situation in "Manchukuo." (Domei, 13th)

### Germany and Italy Submit Documents on Western European Pact to Britain

Willing to Negotiate According to Locarno Principles; Hope to Clarify All Issues; But Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty Should Be Revised

[Berlin] Germany and Italy today submitted a memorandum on the Western European Pact to the British government. The German document was handed over by Foreign Minister Neurath to British Ambassador Phipps. According to information received tonight, this document does not directly respond to Britain's inquiries of November last year, but merely presents some suggestions to clarify Germany's attitude to promote the conclusion of the Western European Pact. The original intention of establishing the Western European Pact was to peacefully resolve Western European issues based on the principle of British and Italian guarantees of the Franco-German border as stated in the Locarno Treaty. Germany is now acting in unison with Italy, declaring that it accepts the Locarno principle as a starting point, hoping that all issues can be clarified as a result. However, it has long been believed here that the scope of this issue has been expanded more than when the Locarno Treaty was signed due to Britain's imprecise attitude. For example, it is not yet known whether the British government is prepared to maintain the guarantees it has previously committed to in their original form or whether it intends to change their nature. Furthermore, the issue of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty has also become a new factor in this case and cannot but be considered at length. (Kokumin, 12th)

[Berlin] Foreign Minister Neurath has delivered a memorandum on the Western European Pact issue to British Ambassador Phipps. According to responsible sources, the key points of the German memorandum are as follows:

㊀ France and Germany should solemnly declare that they will never engage in war against each other, and the guarantor states of the 1925 Locarno Treaty, Britain and Italy, should guarantee this. However, Britain should not simultaneously be a guaranteed state.

㊁ Germany rejects any other restrictions, such as mutual assistance restrictions among the signatory countries of the future Western European Pact.

㊂ Germany is prepared to guarantee the security and neutrality of Belgium.

㊃ France must adopt a different attitude towards the treaties concluded between France and Eastern European countries, and the 'application situation' of the clauses of these treaties should be approved by the two guarantor states of the future Western European Pact. The Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty originally had an automatic and mechanical nature. The suggestion now proposed by Germany actually requires the abolition of this mechanical nature. (Central News Agency, Havas, 12th)

[Rome] Officials have announced that Foreign Minister Ciano has delivered a memorandum from the Italian government on the issue of concluding a Western European Pact to British Ambassador Drummond. This memorandum was submitted with the agreement of Germany. According to responsible sources, the full text of this memorandum is quite long. The content explains that the Italian government is very willing to continue international negotiations as a way to create peace and that it will never take a negative attitude. It also states that the purpose of the memorandum is to bring the two major systems of Italy and Germany and Britain and France closer together, which have always been mutually opposed. Italy has many criticisms of the original plan for the future Western European Pact, and the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty is also opposed by Italy. Political figures point out that although Italy has raised such clear objections, the door to negotiations has not been closed. The Italian government did not directly propose a solution but only believed that there were various difficulties to be resolved before the establishment of the future Western European Pact. (Central News Agency, Havas, 12th)

### Britain and France Discuss the Security of Belgium

French Ambassador Returns Home for Instructions; German Ambassador Visits British Foreign Secretary

[London] German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop visited the Foreign Office this morning to meet with Foreign Secretary Eden to discuss the Western European Pact issue. The German government's note on this matter was submitted to British Ambassador to Germany Phipps yesterday. (Kokumin, 13th)

[London] Well-informed sources have announced that the German memorandum on the future Western European Pact has been sent by airmail by British Ambassador to Germany Phipps and should arrive tonight. Foreign Secretary Eden will review it tomorrow morning and then meet with German Ambassador Ribbentrop at 11:00 AM. As a rule, the main points of notes submitted by foreign governments are telegraphed to the Foreign Office by the British embassy in that country. The fact that this was not done and the full text was sent back shows that the German memorandum must be extremely lengthy. Responsible sources also pointed out that Italy and Germany agreed with each other before submitting their memoranda, and Italy and Germany will also maintain close contact when conducting future negotiations. (Central News Agency, Havas, 12th)

[London] Responsible sources said that the British cabinet decided the other day to negotiate with the relevant countries on the issue of guaranteeing the security of Belgium. This negotiation is not intended to be mixed with the negotiation of the future Western European Pact, as it is in accordance with the wishes expressed by Belgium. Foreign Secretary Eden met with French Ambassador Corbin in the afternoon and informed him of the British government's views on the issue of Belgian security. Corbin then set off to return home to report to his government. Semi-official figures pointed out that Britain is eager to maintain consistent steps with France in negotiating this issue but disregards Italy's participation in it. In addition, a by-election for members of parliament will be held in the Belgian capital, and Prime Minister Janson will compete with Degrelle, the leader of the fascist Rexist Party. British authorities now want to resolve the issue of Belgian security before the election. However, the Belgian wish to prohibit foreign troops from transiting through Belgium is feared to cause difficulties, as Belgium is a member of the League of Nations, and Section 3 of Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations has a provision that any member state should grant transit facilities to other member states. (Central News Agency, Havas, 12th)

### French National Defense Bonds Sell Out Immediately

Second Batch to be Issued

[Paris] The Ministry of Finance announced that the first batch of 5.5 billion francs of national defense bonds issued today had been oversubscribed by 5:00 PM, and latecomers were rejected. According to responsible sources, the second batch of national defense bonds will be issued starting next Tuesday or next Thursday, and the amount will be 2.5 billion francs. (It is reported that the total amount of national defense bonds that Congress has allowed the government to issue is limited to 10.5 billion francs. The enthusiastic subscription for the first batch of national defense bonds is an unprecedented phenomenon since the issuance of the 'National Land Restoration Bonds' in 1871. Financial figures are all full of praise. Today, customers flocked to bank counters across the country, selling their stored gold bars or foreign currencies to subscribe for new bonds. Moreover, today's subscription results are also of great benefit to the Exchange Equalization Fund. Financial figures also said that the success of the issuance of national defense bonds is enough to enrich the national treasury, and the outflow of funds will return to the country, and the franc can also be used to maintain its parity. As a result, the prices of other government bonds will inevitably rise as a result. (Central News Agency, Havas, 12th)

[Paris] The first batch of 5,000,000,000 francs of national defense bonds was issued yesterday morning and ended in the evening, so latecomers were rejected. Finance Minister Auriol decided to start issuing the second batch starting next Tuesday, 'considering that most nationals, especially people in the provinces, are limited by time and have not had the opportunity to enjoy the superior conditions of this bond,' but the number has not yet been announced. It is generally believed that the position of the Exchange Equalization Fund will be greatly consolidated after the historically outflowed gold returns to the country. (Central News Agency, Havas, 13th)

[Paris] The situation of the issuance of French national defense bonds is extremely smooth. It is generally believed that the monetary agreement between Britain, France, and the United States has therefore achieved victory. US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau issued a statement yesterday, saying that the focus of this agreement is to stabilize the currencies of various countries and prevent competitive devaluation of currencies. It is believed that the immediate impact after the issuance of national defense bonds is that the market conditions of various French public bonds and treasury bonds have improved. Financial figures are optimistic about the future of national defense bonds because there are obvious signs of France's economic recovery. For example, the industrial production index in September last year was 95 percent, which rose to 98 percent in October, continued to rise to 99 percent in November, and then jumped to 125 percent in January this year. The production index of the machinery industry has also exceeded the average of 107 percent. In addition, in February this year, the total amount of funds used to establish new companies or increase the original share capital of various companies was 62,000,000 francs, which was only 36,000,000 francs in February last year. The total amount of business tax revenue in February this year increased by 12 percent compared to the same month last year. At the same time, the number of unemployed people is decreasing month by month. As of now, the number is only 400,000, which is 80,000 less than last year. (Central News Agency, Havas, 13th)

### French House of Representatives Passes Law Prohibiting Price Gouging

And Establishes Supervisory Committee

[Paris] The House of Representatives recently passed the entire bill on prohibiting illegal price gouging with a majority of 391 votes to 197 votes. The bill stipulates the establishment of a price supervision committee with the power to audit whether various wholesale prices are appropriate. In addition, a court will be established to deal specifically with cases of illegal price gouging. Cases accused by the price supervision committee will be heard by the court. However, what is stipulated in this bill is limited to wholesale prices, while retail prices and agricultural product prices are not included. When this bill was debated, Minister of Economic Affairs Spinasse attended to explain that when calculating the cost of various wholesale prices, the price of raw materials and the social costs of production (referring to social insurance premiums, etc.) should be taken into account. The purpose of establishing this price supervision committee is to provide more reliable guarantees for the industrial and commercial sectors. The intention of this new law is not to harm the interests of industry, but to provide all guarantees for the industrial sector. (Central News Agency, Havas, 12th)

### U.S. Ambassador Lodges Strong Protest with Germany

German Press Insults America and Expels American Reporter

[Berlin] Since New York Mayor LaGuardia made disrespectful remarks about German leader Hitler, the German media has published various satirical and insulting articles about the American people and government, especially the Nazi Party's official newspaper, the Angriff. U.S. Ambassador to Germany Dodd lodged a strong protest with Foreign Minister Neurath today. Dodd solemnly stated that U.S. foreign policy is based on mutual respect for the rights and sensitivities of other countries, but freedom of speech is guaranteed by the Constitution. Dodd further stated that the U.S. government could not understand the German media's consistent abuse and unfounded attacks, and that the vulgarity and rudeness of these remarks were shocking and appalling, and something that no sensible person would condone, and that their complete disregard for public friendship was unprecedented. After LaGuardia referred to German leader Hitler as a "brown-shirted madman," the German Angriff retaliated with even more vicious attacks, referring to the Jewish women who attended LaGuardia's speeches as street prostitutes. Furthermore, the Nazi Black Guard's official newspaper depicted a large gorilla on its cover, perched atop a tall building, like the "King Kong" in the movie, but with LaGuardia's face. The obscenity of the language was something that no American newspaper would dare to publish. (Central News Agency, 13th, Reuters)

[Berlin] American journalist Boss Mora was expelled from Germany by the German government today. Mr. Boss was a correspondent for the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. This is the seventeenth foreign journalist to be expelled by the Nazi government. (Central News Agency, 13th, Reuters)

[Berlin] According to reliable sources today, German Foreign Minister Neurath assured U.S. Ambassador Dodd that Germany had no intention of insulting the United States, but that New York Mayor LaGuardia's insulting remarks about German leader Hitler inevitably aroused resentment in the German press, and that American newspapers often lacked factual accuracy on German issues, which could easily lead to misunderstandings in the German press.

### American Debate Rages Over Philippine Question

Republicans Oppose Immediate Independence, Philippine Delegation Prepares Memorandum

[Washington] Senator Wolfington today denied that he intended to propose allowing the Philippines immediate independence, and had not even considered the Philippine delegation's opposition to sugar production controls. Republican House Leader Snell told the Associated Press today that Republican members of Congress were not paying attention to shortening the period of Philippine autonomy, but that some small-party members favored maintaining the current independence law. In his personal observation, Filipinos are currently unable to stand on their own, so it would be more beneficial to adhere to the current independence law. As for the U.S. Congress, it will not discuss the issue unless President Roosevelt makes a proposal. The various committees and the Philippine delegation are scheduled to continue their meeting on the 18th of this month, at which time the Philippine side will present a memorandum, including the following points:

㊀ The Philippines' trade surplus with the United States is roughly equal to its various invisible payments.

㊁ U.S. expenditures in the Philippines are mostly for military and administrative purposes, and are not permanent expenditures for the Philippine people.

㊂ The Philippines is a major market for U.S. steel products, textiles, and milk.

㊃ The Philippines is an important trading port in the Far East.

㊄ The U.S.-Philippine reciprocity relationship is mutually beneficial, as is the U.S.'s trade relationship with other countries. (13th, National Telegram)

[Washington] Senator Lewis spoke in the Senate today, opposing the United States' immediate separation from the Philippines. This was in response to Philippine President Quezon's request to shorten the period of autonomy. Lewis's reasons for opposing were that the international situation in the Far East, including Japan and Russia, was very complicated, and that based on the current situation in the Far East, he had to oppose the United States' abandonment of Philippine naval bases, because in the event of an emergency, that area would be the United States' first line of defense. The American people are currently too focused on trivial matters and are neglecting national defense. Before the United States had conflicts with Germany and Spain, it thought there was not much danger. Looking at the past from today's perspective, the situation is still the same. We should pay attention to foreign changes and be careful to prevent those who, under the guise of friendship, secretly plot to hinder our country's future peace and security. When Congress discusses the naval issue, I will take action. If we return the Philippines to the Filipinos immediately, the Japanese will take advantage of the situation in the event of an emergency.

### British House of Commons Discusses Land Reclamation Issue

George Announces Plan, Chancellor of the Exchequer Considers It Difficult

[London] The House of Commons discussed the appropriation of funds for the unemployed areas bill today. Former Prime Minister Lloyd George spoke, saying that Britain is currently less prepared in terms of food production than it was in 1914. Millions of acres of land are barren and uncultivated. Britain currently has only one million farmers, while Germany has ten million. Before the war, British farmers accounted for 7% of the national population, but today they account for only 4.6%. The four countries of Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, and Russia ultimately failed in the Great War because of food shortages. If Britain had not had maritime transportation at the time, it would not have been able to last 18 months. It is now imperative to seek the development of farmland in this special area with an appropriation of £300,000, which is also a way to supplement national defense. Although Britain spends a great deal of money on military preparations, reaching £300 million per year, it has neglected the essentials of food production. Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain replied that Lloyd George's plan to immigrate 500,000 people to cultivate wasteland would only cause an unnatural surge in agricultural product prices. Even many experienced farmers would not be able to reap any harvest on this wasteland. Furthermore, this plan is in conflict with Britain's established methods with the self-governing colonies and foreign countries, as it would reduce the amount of agricultural products imported into Britain from the self-governing colonies, and their purchasing power would also be reduced accordingly. As a result, those in Britain engaged in industrial production would inevitably face unemployment, and their number would be greater than those who could be accommodated in agriculture. The number of unemployed in this special area has decreased by 120,000 in the past two years. South Wales is the most difficult area, but it has also decreased by 20%. This is because the government's policy is to utilize the entire military preparation process to ensure that the unemployed areas obtain more work. As of the end of December last year, the value of goods purchased in the unemployed areas was £41 million, and by the end of January of this year, this number had increased to £57 million.

### Mussolini Walks to Egyptian Border to Survey

[Libya, Derna] Italian Prime Minister Mussolini presided over the opening ceremony of a thousand-mile military road here today, and walked to the Egyptian border, looking ahead from afar. After briefly looking back, he turned around and went to the opening ceremony of the new road. A year ago, the barbed wire barriers built on the Egyptian border were heavily guarded by troops, but now there was no one there. After the ceremony, Mussolini boarded his car and left. Another 120 cars, filled with officials and journalists, followed closely behind. Wherever the cars passed, dust rose, and the residents were stunned to see them. The people applauded and cheered, and some beat drums. Ostriches, hearing the commotion, were frightened and scattered in all directions. (Central News Agency, 13th, Reuters)

### Unprecedentedly Severe Drought in Sichuan

Liu and Wang Telegraph Central Government to Swiftly Allocate Huge Funds, Provincial Relief Committee Also Telegraphs Executive Yuan Relief Committee to Appeal

Chengdu Correspondence: Sichuan Province has been suffering from a prolonged drought, and the disaster situation is serious. The disaster area covers four-fifths of the entire province, and the number of disaster victims is over 20 million, truly an unprecedented catastrophe. The Sichuan Provincial Government, pleading for the lives of the disaster victims, has repeatedly telegraphed the Central Government, requesting the allocation of funds for relief. Now, because the situation is becoming increasingly urgent, it telegraphed President Chiang again the day before yesterday, requesting that he swiftly approve the allocation. At the same time, the Sichuan Provincial Relief Committee also telegraphed the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Relief Committee, stating that the Sichuan disaster has reached its most serious juncture and urgently needs huge funds for relief. The province has suffered from disasters year after year and has no financial resources to save itself. It sincerely laid out the disaster situation and appealed for relief. We now record the original texts of the two telegrams as follows:

Chairman Liu's Telegram

To Chiang, President of the Executive Yuan, Nanjing: Having received your telegram, I respectfully acknowledge that you are concerned about the disaster victims and have instructed the Ministry of Finance and the Relief Committee to promptly deliberate and respond. Your kind words are welcomed by hundreds of millions of people, and we should quietly await further instructions. However, the disaster situation in Sichuan Province is becoming increasingly serious because it has not rained in recent days, and the situation is extremely worrying. Although temporary relief measures have been proposed in the hope that they will be helpful, unfortunately, the counties have been barren for years and have little ability to save themselves. The provincial government has also exhausted its wisdom and ability and is struggling to cope. I hereby appeal again, humbly begging you to bestow your grace and swiftly approve the allocation so that there may be a glimmer of hope. I am anxiously awaiting orders. Respectfully, Liu Xiang bows, the province's finances and the people are in dire straits.

Provincial Relief Committee Telegram

(Title omitted) We believe that Sichuan is unfortunately plagued by frequent disasters. Last year, the Red Bandits occupied the northern route and roamed for years, and then spread to the four sides, with the east, west, and south sides all suffering. They burned, killed, looted, and destroyed everything they passed, and the people died one after another, and the fields were all left barren. We were fortunate to receive huge funds from the Executive Yuan to distribute for emergency relief, so that the survivors were able to live on what they received. We are grateful for your generosity, and the masses praise you. However, after this major and painful trauma, the vitality has not yet recovered slightly, and the middle of the drought has been compounded by hail, insect plagues, and wind disasters. According to the reports from the counties, it has reached more than three-quarters of the entire province, and we have repeatedly reported to the Executive Yuan and the committees. Therefore, the spring relief did not end until July and August, and the relief work could not be completed. We only hoped that after a long drought, there would be rain, and we could order the planting of miscellaneous grains in the winter for relief. Who would have thought that last year's severe drought lasted until January and February of this year, when there was only a short period of light rain that penetrated only two inches into the soil. In an instant, the sunlight was scorching again, and it was of no use at all. The fields were cracked, the wheat and barley withered, the sowing did not produce anything, and even the water sources were cut off. The people had no way to find drinking water. The spring famine is ten times worse than last year. This is truly a great calamity for the people of Sichuan. Since August of last year, the counties have been sending documents and telegrams, dozens every day, with photographs and charts, which they send to the committee. After reading them, we are burning with anxiety. It is our responsibility, and we cannot sleep peacefully. What is even more worrying is that the people, since they cannot live, will not fear death. They will form groups to steal food, and even the government can do nothing about it. They will move from village A to town B, or from county A to county B, gathering together and blocking roads. In places like Wusheng, Zhongxian, and Yuechi, it has spread to neighboring counties, and they have searched and looted everything. They have then fled to the border of Hubei Province. The authorities of Hubei Province have telegraphed the Sichuan Provincial Government to stop them. The people of our country are by nature attached to their homes and do not want to move easily. Who would be willing to leave their hometown and abandon their families? Since they are willing to abandon their homeland and their flesh and blood, then it can be known that they have no worries and no fears. At first, they will loot food, and then they will loot property. Thus, the hungry people will turn into bandits. Moreover, the well-known bandits of ordinary times will take advantage of the opportunity to gather the refugees and hide in the mountains, appearing and disappearing from time to time. Therefore, the banditry in the counties has been more rampant than before in recent days. This is not because of the failure of the government, but because Heaven is doing it. Since Heaven has brought down its cruelty, we can only rely on human efforts to save the situation. If we do not take measures to rescue them at this time, they will inevitably take risks, and everything will be out of control. Then, even if there are knives, saws, cauldrons, and severe punishments, I am afraid they will be of no use. The collapse of the soil is worse than the disintegration of tiles, and the people in chaotic times are prone to wrongdoing. It is foreseeable that the disaster of the roving bandits in the late Ming Dynasty will be repeated in Sichuan. The past is clear, and the lessons are not far away. Thinking of this, we cannot help but tremble with fear. Moreover, today our national plan has long been set, and Sichuan Province bears the special task of revitalizing the nation. If we do not take measures to remedy the situation, to cultivate the people's livelihood, to gradually restore the rural areas, to enter the path of construction, and to shoulder the heavy responsibility, we will only increase the worries of the Executive Yuan. This committee is in charge of relief and has witnessed the devastation. We must not sound the alarm, nor dare to withhold anything from above. Knowing that the national treasury is difficult, we must plead for the people. When people are impoverished, they cry out to Heaven. When they are sick, they cry out to their parents. This committee, on behalf of millions of disaster victims, appeals based on the facts. We would never dare to groan without pain or falsely make a request. Although we have received your two telegrams, instructing us to first use half of the 140,000 yuan of the Sichuan Provincial Disaster Relief Reserve Fund for the whole year, plus the pre-allocated debt tickets worth about 90,000 yuan, and to send a letter to the provincial government to investigate the heavily affected counties, and separately exempt them from grain tax. On the one hand, we have instructed the counties to use local non-urgent public funds for relief as soon as possible, and in addition to allocating emergency relief to the most severely affected areas, we should still try to contribute from this province. However, the provincial government has reduced or exempted grain taxes in dozens of counties, which is already several million yuan short, and it cannot save itself with its financial resources. If this continues, what can be expected in the future? We earnestly request that the Executive Yuan consider the special situation in Sichuan, which is unable to save itself, and immediately allocate 5 million yuan for relief, and send senior officials to Sichuan to preside over the distribution.

### Peiping Police Bureau Uncovers Drug Trafficking Organization

Main Culprit, Gou Songzhai, Colludes with a Certain Foreigner, the Poisonous Atmosphere Spreads Throughout Henan Province, All Packaged and Sold by Gou. Gou and More Than Ten Other Criminals Have All Been Arrested

Peiping Correspondence: Gou Songzhai, a 57-year-old Henan native residing at No. 4, Lane 3, Shibanfang, used to be addicted to heroin, but now he has changed his business to trafficking heroin. He colludes with a certain foreigner to transport drugs from Tianjin to Peiping, and then Gou wholesales them to others for sale in Henan Province, no different from a general sales agency. He has a total of more than 40 people under him, all of whom are small-scale heroin wholesalers, transporting and selling. The main sales market is in Henan. It is said that Gou has been in this business for five or six years and has made a fortune, and his family property has now reached 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Recently, Gou's business has been very good, and those who come in and out of his door are increasingly complex, and cars often fill the door, and some foreigners go there. The No. 6 Sub-Bureau of the Police Bureau, upon receiving the report, dispatched officers to inspect the alley from time to time and made several arrests, but there was no evidence. At about 7 p.m. on the 9th, two police officers from the district were passing by the area after dinner when they saw a person coming out of Gou's house who looked very suspicious. They arrested him and found more than 50 taels of heroin and more than 200 yuan in cash. They took him to the sub-bureau. At this time, Gou had no idea. After several interrogations of the suspect, he refused to confess. It was not until about 6 a.m. on the 10th that he confessed his name as Zhen Yunzhi, 23 years old, from Henan. He confirmed that Gou was in collusion with a certain foreigner to sell heroin in Henan Province. Each time, the profit was more than double. Now, the poisonous atmosphere has spread throughout Henan Province. At 7 a.m. on the 10th, there were two more people carrying drugs on the Peiping-Hankou train to Henan. After the interrogation, the director of the sub-bureau, Yuan Huahan, immediately dispatched Inspector Xu Wencheng, leading more than ten police officers, along with Zhen Yunzhi, to rush to the West Railway Station. At the same time, he dispatched officer Qi Rongjiu, leading police officers, to go to Gou's house to search and arrest. When Xu and others arrived at the West Station, there were only more than ten minutes left before the train departed. They boarded the train to search, and the two drug carriers were indeed on the train. When they saw Zhen with the police, they knew that something was wrong and immediately got off the train and walked on the platform. Xu and others did not find these two people and also got off the train, asking Zhen if the people had come. After a while, Zhen saw the two people and gave them a hint. The police stepped forward to arrest them. The two were still very stubborn. After searching, they found nothing. They then asked where their luggage was, but they did not answer. The police then escorted the two back onto the train and asked the passengers about their luggage one by one. Finally, they found four pieces of luggage without an owner in the third-class carriage. They suspected that it belonged to the two people and brought it to the platform for inspection. They found 311 "ruyi" bags filled with heroin in the new cotton quilt. In the old suitcase, they found 29 packages of heroin. In the pillow, they found two packages of ingredients, weighing a total of more than 650 taels, worth more than 30,000 yuan. At this point, the two could not hide it and claimed that one was named Yang Guishan, 21 years old, and the other was Zhao Liancheng, also known as Xu Shengong, 26 years old, both from Henan. They were then tied up and taken to the sub-bureau. After the officers Qi Rongjiu and others went to Gou's house, they used a plan to lure Gou out and arrest him, and also arrested Du Youcheng, Teng Lixian, Su Youwang, and eleven other people, and took them back to the sub-bureau. After a thorough interrogation all night, the entire case has been clarified. At 6:30 p.m. on the 11th, all the people and evidence in the case were sent to the Police Bureau. When Gou and the other criminals were being escorted away, they were still smiling bitterly, as if they were not afraid. They will be transferred to the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Garrison Headquarters for strict handling within a few days. Even by the morning of the 12th, the police were still secretly guarding Gou's house, hoping to arrest those who came to pick up the drugs, so as to wipe them out in one fell swoop. After Gou was arrested, the poisonous atmosphere may be slightly reduced. (12th)

### Tungsten Ore in Pinghe, Fujian, is Stolen and Sold

Foreign Merchant Honda Buys in Xiamen, Exports via Pinghe and Zhao'an

Xiamen Correspondence: Recently, there has been a foreign broker named Honda who often comes to the Foreigner's Hotel on Gulangyu, Xiamen. His main business is to buy tungsten ore produced in Pinghe County. The price is 280 yuan per ton (16 dan). After the purchase, it is transported from Pinghe to the Yamaguchi in Zhao'an. It is said that the tungsten ore produced in Pinghe is located at the junction of the county and Dapu County in Guangdong, more than 100 li from the county seat of Pinghe. The output is very rich. The villagers did not initially recognize it as a valuable mineral and used to mine it for making iron agricultural tools. Recently, they learned that it was tungsten ore, so some people privately transported it to Hong Kong for sale, where it could be sold for 27-28 yuan per dan (100 catties). Once the news spread, everyone knew about it. A certain Li and a certain Yu from Guangdong organized a company to buy it from the villagers there and sell it to foreigners in Xiamen. They agreed with the foreign broker Honda to transport it through Zhao'an for export. (March 12th)

### Troops Stationed in Chaoshan Eradicate Opium Seedlings

No More Poisonous Plants in the Mountains of Fengshun, Local Traffickers Use Various Cunning Schemes

Shantou Correspondence: Guangdong Province strictly prohibits opium and gambling, and the time limit for banning opium has been shortened from four years to three years. Registration of opium smokers in counties, districts, and villages is being carried out vigorously, and those who transport, plant, and sell opium are subject to heavier penalties. Announcements prohibiting the planting of opium have been issued every year, but every time, someone has forced the residents in the mountains to plant opium. Therefore, the fact that "local goods" are on the market in the Chaoshan region is well known to everyone. Every early spring, in the more remote mountain villages, there are poppies blooming in red and white, and soon they bear fruit in abundance. Before the morning mist dissipates, the farmers go to the fields to collect the sap, one bowl and one pot. At first, it is milky white, gradually turning yellow-brown and then black. This is the raw material for making "local goods." "Local goods" are divided into Qiaozhu (Pu Ning) goods and Hepo (Jieyang) goods. Raoping and Zhao'an produce even more "local goods." Generally speaking, the more remote the area, the more "local goods" are produced. In Tangkeng Market in Jieyang, there are sellers of opium seeds, which look like sesame seeds. Each cup of seeds, worth three yuan, can be used to plant one mu of land. This is also a very public matter. Recently, the Chaoshan garrison received reports that someone in various parts of Fengshun County was secretly forcing villagers to plant opium seedlings under false pretenses. Therefore, the 938th Regiment sent two companies of troops to Jueshun to eradicate them. The villages heard that the garrison's eradication of opium was not comparable to that of other armed inspection teams, where each inspection required a fee to be paid. Therefore, they automatically uprooted or replanted them in the deep mountain trenches overnight, letting them grow and die on their own. Those who had not planted them did not dare to plant them again. Merchants selling opium seeds in cloth bags in Tangkeng abandoned their bags and fled into the mountains. Wherever the military might reached, unscrupulous people fled in the wind. The garrison also stated that they would not allow a single opium seedling to exist in the defense area.

Recently, the search for opium transportation has been very strict, so those who smuggle it are taking even greater risks. For example, opium is transported in parcels through the post office, which has already been discovered in Shantou. On the 5th of this month, Shantou City cracked a smuggling opium organization. The organization used salted red meat bags to carry it, each bag containing about 48 taels. The goods were transferred from Macau to Hong Kong and arrived in Shantou on the Haili ship. After arriving in Shantou, they entrusted the Ji Yuanshun Customs Brokerage in Yonghe Street to unload it, but it was cracked by the customs. There were a total of 50 bags. The customs immediately detained the barge owner Xiao Quanhua and the customs broker Lin Xianhao. All of the more than 2,000 taels of opium have been reported to the Provincial Opium Prohibition Bureau for interrogation. The Shantou Opium Prohibition Inspectorate, based on the clues, went to search for the opium trafficking headquarters and found more than 30 taels. All of the opium criminals fled in the wind. It is said that such trafficking has occurred many times before, and five gangs, totaling more than 10,000 taels, have been smuggled in. This opium trafficking organization has a very strong background, and the opium traffickers are mostly treacherous and reckless people.

### Tragedy Resulting from a Bigamy Case

Both Male and Female Protagonists are Figures in the Education Field / Incensed Father Blinded by Son's Disrespect / First Wife Dies by Poisoning, Grandmother Swallows Gold

A telegram from Xuzhou states that in recent years, in the Xubu community, cases of marital discord among young men and women have emerged one after another. The most recent case of marital discord between Xu Dexin and Zhang Guangluan has escalated into a family tragedy of the most cruel kind. It is said that Xu Houying, the father of Xu Dexin, was a businessman who was on good terms with his colleague, Li Guangyue. Xu only had one son, Dexin, and Li only had one daughter, Yingnian. They decided to arrange a marriage between the two families. Ten years ago, Xu's son was twenty-one and Li's daughter was twenty-two when they happily married. They had two sons who both died young. Five years ago, Xu went to Shanghai to study at the Art School. Zhang Yinming's second daughter, named Guangluan, who was also studying in Shanghai, became his "dry sister" but they engaged in a real romance. After graduation, they both taught in Biancheng, living together like husband and wife. Zhang gave birth to two daughters, the elder named Dalan, currently six years old, and the younger named Xiaolan, four years old. Zhang is still in her prime, as tender as a budding flower. After Zhang gave birth, she had to legitimize her status. Xu, however, already had a wife and feared the crime of bigamy. Therefore, in the 23rd year of the Republic, he devised a plan to trick his wife into signing a divorce certificate, which he published in the Xuzhou newspaper. The old-fashioned woman had no knowledge of such matters. Xu's father, however, believing his daughter-in-law to be gentle and virtuous, firmly upheld justice. He issued a notice to refute the divorce, claiming that his daughter-in-law had been tricked and the divorce was invalid. At that time, the family was in great turmoil. Xu threatened suicide to coerce his wife, who, out of love for her husband, willingly agreed to serve her parents-in-law, allowing Xu and Zhang to marry, following the so-called "two great families" custom of old Xubu society. Xu and Zhang held their wedding in their home on the seventeenth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar in the 24th year of the Republic. Dalan was raised by Zhang, while Xiaolan was nominally raised by Yingnian. The family was fortunate to avoid turmoil, but Xu's father, deeply affected by traditional morality, felt deeply ashamed of his unfilial son. He was so angry and depressed that he lost sight in one eye. Later, Zhang gave birth to another son, but the couple's feelings for each other gradually faded. In the first month of this year, Xu and Zhang had a quarrel in Bian, and Zhang angrily returned to Xu. Xu sent letters urging her to return, but when she did not, he also went home. He invited Zhang to a family meeting. When Zhang arrived at Xu's house, she saw Xu sharing a bed and talking with his first wife. Enraged, she questioned who she was and interrogated Xu. Xu's grandmother and parents, out of love for their daughter-in-law, also questioned Zhang. Zhang then rushed to the Public Security Bureau to report the incident. After investigation by the bureau, it was deemed a mediation case. Seeing the situation as irreconcilable, and with the Bian school about to open, Xu hastily returned to Kaifeng. Zhang then filed a lawsuit in the local court, accusing Xu of bigamy. Xu's family received the summons and was greatly alarmed. Xu's father, already angered by his son's unfilial behavior, suddenly suffered a nervous breakdown. Xu's mother went to Bian alone, urging her son to return to Xu on the evening of the seventh day to hold a family meeting. No one had a good solution. Xu insisted that only if his first wife acknowledged the validity of the divorce certificate would things be settled. Li Yingnian, feeling both the shame of being abandoned and the humiliation of appearing in court, swallowed sleeping pills and opium paste on the night of the eighth day in an attempt to end her life. Xu's grandmother, disgusted by the troubles in her old age, also swallowed a pair of gold earrings. Both were discovered and sent to Kunwei Hospital for treatment. Li Yingnian's poisoning was severe, and she died early on the tenth day. Xu's grandmother's gold earrings remained in her stomach, and her condition was still critical. Zhang's lawsuit against Xu was investigated by the court on the afternoon of the ninth day. Xu had not yet arrived, and Zhang appeared in court accompanied by her father. After questioning by the judge, the case was deemed to involve bigamy and forgery, and Zhang was instructed to file a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office, first opening an investigation court and then filing a public prosecution. When the incident at Xu's residence occurred on the tenth day, the court sent Inspector Chen to investigate and verify that she had indeed died of poisoning, ordering the body to be coffined and buried. Xu Dexin, his mother Xu Shenshi, and Yingnian's father Li Guangyue and mother Li Wangshi were summoned to the scene and questioned one by one. Xu Shenshi testified that her son had tricked his daughter-in-law into signing the divorce certificate. The inspector ordered the entire case to be sent to the trial court for trial on the sixteenth day. Xu and Zhang are now avoiding each other like Yin and Xing. Xu's grandmother and his father are still in critical condition. Several members of the family may be sacrificed for Xu's sake. This case has shocked society, and everyone sighs at its cruelty, unsure of how it will end.

Shanghai is the only large city in China, with a population of 3.7 million. Its industrial and commercial development is the best in the country. The Mayor intends to choose one day each year for all citizens of the city, regardless of farmers, workers, merchants, students, soldiers, or police, and regardless of men, women, old, or young, to enjoy a day of revelry together. This was suggested by the City Council and formally approved by the Municipal Government meeting. It was decided that March 21st would be the Shanghai Festival. On this day, the most universal and enthusiastic methods will be used to provide an opportunity for everyone to enjoy themselves. As for the specific content, the Mayor intends to hold various competitions and exhibitions, dividing the city into several districts and organizing events based on the conditions of each district. For example, there could be an arts and crafts exhibition, a national arts and crafts competition, the establishment of various temporary markets, and the holding of improvement competitions, etc. Due to time constraints this year, it will not be possible to hold a large-scale event, but we still hope that everyone will express their opinions and choose the easiest and most manageable events to conduct a trial run.

### Kenji Kodama and Others Arrive in Shanghai Today

Visiting Our Authorities in Beijing That Evening / Various Public Organizations Express Their Motivation for the Reception

A Central News Agency report states: Kenji Kodama, Chairman of the Japan-China Trade Association, and his party of thirteen, who are coming to China to attend the first general meeting of the China-Japan Trade Association, arrived in China on the Nagasaki Maru from Osaka on the twelfth and will arrive in Shanghai at 2:00 PM today, berthing at the Huishan Wharf in Yangshupu. Xu Shiying, the ambassador to Japan who recently returned to China, came to Shanghai from Beijing last night and will go to welcome them in a private capacity. Zhou Zuomin, Chairman of the China-Japan Trade Association, and leaders from the financial and industrial circles of both China and Japan in Shanghai will also go to the pier to welcome them. After arriving in Shanghai, Kodama and his party will first visit Japanese officials and civilians and then go to Beijing that evening to visit our government authorities and attend banquets hosted by various parties. Their accommodation at the Capital Hotel has been arranged by Wang Yutong, Secretary-General of the China-Japan Trade Association, who was dispatched to Beijing yesterday in advance. It is also reported that Kodama and his party are scheduled to return to Shanghai by train on the morning of the seventeenth to attend the meeting and visit people from all walks of life. Some members are scheduled to return to Japan by ship on the twenty-third, while others will visit various places and tour scenic spots.

Xin Sheng News Agency reports: The Japanese economic delegation led by Kodama and his party of thirteen will arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Local Association, the Banking Association, the Money Trade Association, and the Shipping Association are preparing to host them. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency specially inquired with these public organizations yesterday about their intentions. They replied as follows: "Last year, several industrialists from our country went to Japan to inspect various industrial and commercial sectors. This time, their visit to China to inspect is actually intended as a return courtesy. We also heard that they are industrialists with real economic power. They have come from afar to our country not only to inspect the state of our country's economic construction but also to deeply understand the genuine mentality of the average Chinese person. It must be known that the attitude of our public organizations has always been solemn. For example, recently, the Nagoya Pan-Pacific Exposition in Japan requested that various circles in this city select exhibits to participate, but because we recognized that the association had established a 'Manchukuo' pavilion, the leaders of the public organizations consulted and firmly refused, frankly stating the reasons for not participating. This time, Mr. Kodama and the twelve industrialists are visiting China with goodwill. Reading the Tokyo telegram about their pre-departure remarks, they advocated improving relations between the two countries on the principle of respecting territorial sovereignty, equality, and mutual benefit. Since their intentions are like this, the public organizations can certainly host them. Moreover, taking this opportunity, everyone can meet, exchange opinions, and make them understand the progress and obstacles of China's construction undertakings in recent years, as well as the mentality of the average Chinese person, wouldn't that be a good thing?"

### Shao Lizi, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, Hosted a Banquet for the Press Yesterday

During the banquet, Shao stood up and gave a speech, elaborating on his expectations for the press in the future. He said, in essence, that at a time when the country is beset by both internal and external troubles, members of the press should work together to achieve the two goals of unifying the country and revitalizing the nation. Shao also pointed out the impact of newspaper supplements on society and hoped that members of the press would pay the same attention to the selection of materials for supplements as they do to the writing of editorials and the recording of news. Shao's sincere attitude and profound theories won enthusiastic applause from those present. Then, Shen Gongbi expressed his views on behalf of the press. Finally, Shao explained the "record everything heard" principle that the Chinese press has always adhered to, saying that this principle is actually a mistaken view, as the selection of news must be based on authenticity and cannot simply record everything heard. The guests and hosts parted happily at around 10:00 PM. Shao is also scheduled to host a banquet for the local literary and artistic circles this afternoon and will return to Beijing that evening.

### Lawyer Ye Shaoying, a Resident of Yu Gu Village, Sues the Public Works Department for Removing Obstructions

Having Always Paid Property Taxes, Why Illegally Block Passage? Resolved to Sue in the Consular Court and Request Urgent Action

The Public Works Department (工部局) of the Public Concession, noting that some residents in the extraterritorial road area were refusing to pay property taxes, blocked the sewers of Yu Gu Village (愚谷邨) on Yu Yuan Road (愚園路) on the morning of the 11th, and nailed obstacles to block the entrance of the alley, preventing residents from entering and exiting. Despite protests from residents and the municipal government, this was ineffective. Lawyer Ye Shaoying (葉少英), residing at number 62 of the village, stated that he had always paid the property taxes levied by the Public Works Department, never owing a penny. He had even paid the winter property tax of last year. As for this year’s spring property tax, he was unable to pay because the Public Works Department did not send anyone to collect it. However, this oversight should be attributed to the Public Works Department. The Public Works Department's actions were both unreasonable and illegal. Therefore, the day before yesterday morning, he sent a letter to the Public Works Department, stating the reasons and ordering them to remove the obstacles and connect the sewers immediately after receiving the letter, otherwise he would sue them in court, and declared that he reserved the right to seek compensation for the damages suffered. At the same time, he enclosed a check for thirty yuan and six jiao, the amount of the spring donation. However, since the letter was sent, the Public Works Department had ignored it and had not immediately removed the obstacles. Therefore, Lawyer Ye prepared a complaint yesterday morning and filed a lawsuit against the Public Works Department in the Consular Court (領事公堂). The content of the complaint, in addition to stating the illegal actions of the Public Works Department, also reserved the right to sue for damages. However, since the trial may take time, he attached a request for urgent action, ordering the Public Works Department to quickly remove the obstacles and connect the sewers. The lawsuit was prepared to be delivered to the Consular Court yesterday morning, but yesterday was Saturday, and the Consular Court's office hours were until 12 noon. Therefore, if time did not permit, it would be sent out on Monday.

Party and Government Mediation Leads to Resumption of Work in the Afternoon

According to Da Gong News Agency, the No. 2 factory of Xin Yu Textile Company (新裕紡織公司), a Chinese-owned company located at No. 8 Roberts Road (勞勃生路) in western Shanghai, employs more than 1,900 male and female workers. Last month, due to the reorganization of the factory, the Shan Cheng Fu Trust Company (山誠孚信託公司) took over and planned to change the internal staff, which caused panic among the workers and led to a strike. The Party and government authorities sent personnel to mediate, and the factory recognized that it would not dismiss workers, so work was resumed immediately. Yesterday, the factory demolished some of the old machinery in the weaving department and planned to dismiss dozens of workers. When all the workers heard the news, they believed that the factory had clearly violated the above mediation decision. Therefore, at 6:00 a.m. yesterday, all the male and female workers entered the factory and went on strike together, and then left the factory. Upon hearing the news, the Party and government authorities of the city immediately dispatched Lu Yin Chu (陸陰初) from the Civil Movement Section of the Municipal Party Department, Zhang Chuqiang (張楚强) from the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, Gong Yuting (龔雨亭) from the General Labor Union, and Wang Zhuping (王竹坪), the director of the Cotton Textile Workers Union of the Third District, to investigate both sides and find ways to mediate. After negotiating three measures, all the workers resumed work uniformly at 1:30 p.m. The measures are as follows: ㊀ The old machines that have been demolished will no longer be equipped, and those that have not been demolished will be stopped from being demolished. ㊁ Workers whose old machines have been demolished and have no work to do will be paid by the factory until the dispute is resolved. ㊂ The Municipal Party Department will convene both parties for mediation on Tuesday afternoon to resolve the remaining labor disputes.

### Antique Workers Strike Again

Social Affairs Bureau Scheduled to Mediate Tomorrow

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, after the workers of antique stores such as Huang Zhongli (黃鍾利) and Ruan Baoji (阮寶記) put forward demands for improved treatment, the Social Affairs Bureau mediated on the 9th without success. The workers of each store went on strike again the day before yesterday. The owners of each store jointly petitioned the Party and government authorities to stop them. It is reported that the authorities have scheduled to convene both labor and capital parties for mediation again tomorrow afternoon.

### Yu Cun Silk Factory Denies Manager's Escape

According to Guomin News Agency, yesterday's newspaper reported that Yu Cun Silk Factory (裕村綢廠) at No. 296 Bailinan Road had delayed the resumption of work. The Social Affairs Bureau mediated that before the resumption of work, the factory would pay each worker a food allowance of five jiao per day, but it only paid for three days and then stopped. The factory's Qian Zaizhong (錢在中) escaped without a trace. According to the person in charge of the factory, the business of our factory is not good, so we stopped working. We reported to the Social Affairs Bureau in early last month, and the Social Affairs Bureau convened a questioning session on the 8th of this month because the workers illegally occupied the factory. The mediator Wang Zhusheng (汪竹笙) asked the workers to move out of the factory immediately, move back to the workshop to live in, and then convene a mediation, and both parties agreed on the record. There is no such thing as ordering our factory to pay living expenses before the problem is solved. In addition, Qian Zaizhong, the manager of our factory, is still working in the Ningbo Road (寗波路) office as usual, and has not gone elsewhere. However, until today, the workers still defied the bureau's order and occupied the factory as usual, which is deeply regrettable. The reports in various newspapers are completely inconsistent with the facts.

### Huian Steamer Leaves Tianjin and Collides with Xinfeng Steamer

The Huian (迥安) steamer of the Zhengji Company (政記公司), with a load capacity of 2,050 tons and a draft of 16 feet and 10 inches, was leaving Tanggu (塘沽) in Tianjin (天津) this time. When the ship was turning around after leaving the No. 1 pier of the China Merchants Bureau (招商局), the stern was washed over due to the excessive tide in the port, and it moved horizontally in front of the No. 2 pier of the China Merchants Bureau. At the No. 2 pier, the Xinfeng (新豐) steamer of the China Merchants Bureau was parked. The stern of the Huian collided with the outer side of the Xinfeng, cutting off the wooden ladder, platform, and iron supports for passengers to get on and off the Xinfeng's starboard side. The outer frame of the ladder on the right side was cracked and damaged, and the English letters of the Xinfeng's name were completely knocked off. Furthermore, due to the rapid current and tight cables, the high tide and waves severely damaged the mooring tiger tooth on the left side of the stern, as well as the nearby iron railings and the lower pad wood. According to reports, the Xinfeng steamer had just undergone major repairs and was making its first trip to Tianjin when it was damaged by the Huian steamer. Chen Taibing (陳泰炳), the captain of the Huian steamer, reported the incident to Shanghai yesterday.

### Chinese Laborers Returning from France Appoint Representatives to Petition Yesterday

General Labor Union Sends Representatives to Express Condolences

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, thirty-three Chinese laborers, including Ding Huanzhang (丁煥章), who participated in the war in France, returned to China. After arriving in Shanghai, they specially appointed Ding Huanzhang and You Fuqi (尤福起) as representatives yesterday morning at 10 a.m., and Yang Gengtao (楊賡陶) accompanied them to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau (僑務局) to request assistance with free tickets. Tan Zhonglu (譚仲祿) of the bureau accompanied them to the Municipal Government to petition. Lin Yannan (林炎南), the director of the General Affairs Section of the First Department, received them and introduced the representatives to the Police Bureau to meet with Section Chief Hong Qi (洪起) and Director Yin Guanzhi (殷冠之) to ask for ways to provide them with boat tickets. Once the boat tickets are secured, the laborers will be sent back to their hometowns in batches.

Seeking Ways to Help

After the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission received these Chinese laborers returning to Shanghai, it requested the Municipal Government to issue free boat tickets for them due to their extreme poverty. Yesterday, it also submitted a report to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, reporting the situation of their return and requesting relief or job placement for them, so as to avoid drifting in other places. The laborers expressed their gratitude for the warm hospitality of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau and planned to request the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to establish overseas Chinese affairs bureaus in various provinces and cities in order to guide Chinese people to go abroad and arrange for overseas Chinese returning to the country.

Claiming Reserve Funds

At the end of the war, the Chinese laborers who participated in the war stipulated that those who stayed in France to work would have 1,000 francs of return reserve funds collected by the consulate according to their names. Of the thirty-three people returning to China this time, in addition to those who had already withdrawn, there were still 15,340 francs. Before leaving, the consulate said that it had telegraphed to Shanghai. Because the workers did not receive the money, each worker specially copied the receipt number and amount of the consulate and submitted it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for investigation. Xie Gui (謝貴) had 400 francs, Xu Chen (胥臣) had 756 francs, Lu Jin Kui (祿金奎) had 1,062 francs, Zhang Changhua (張長華) had 506 francs, Jiang Zhixian (蔣志獻) had 200 francs, Wang Lizhi (汪立之) had 300 francs, Yang Zhengxiang (楊正祥) had 1,060 francs, Wang Yuanxin (王元信) had 457 francs, Wang Rencai (王仁才) had 1,060 francs, Chen Zhifu (陳志福) had 560 francs, Zhou Jingyuan (周景元) had 1,042 francs, Guo Yuanhou (郭元厚) had 1,000 francs, Zhang Guilin (張桂林) had 1,000 francs, Guo Xiangyou (郭祥有) had 758 francs, Chen Jiwen (陳吉文) had 757 francs, Liu Deshan (劉德山) had 1,056 francs, Zhang Zhenshan (張振山) had 600 francs, You Fuqi (尤福起) had 459 francs, Ding Huanzhang (丁煥章) had 900 francs, Wei Chaozeng (魏朝增) had 700 francs, Li Hengji (李珩吉) and others had 500 francs, Zhang Yunan (張玉南) had 107 francs, and Xu Zhende (徐珍德) had 100 francs. They asked the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau to forward it to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to order the consulate in Paris to send it directly to the hometown of each worker as capital for small businesses to maintain their livelihoods.

Labor Circles Extend Condolences

According to Da Gong News Agency, when the Chinese laborers who participated in the war in France returned to China, the General Labor Union of this city received a telegram from Consul Lin (林領事) of our country's consulate in Paris. In addition to sending personnel to take care of them when they arrived in port, the association also sent executive committee members Zhou Xuexiang (周學湘) and Shao Xubai (邵虛白) to the Wanshun Inn (萬順客棧) on Xinkaihe (新開河) yesterday afternoon at 6:00 p.m. to express condolences to all the Chinese laborers. The association will hold a reception at Dahongyun (大鴻運) on Sima Road (四馬路) this afternoon at 6:00 p.m. Because the association believes that the situation of the Chinese laborers who were sent back to China is very miserable, it will invite various groups to discuss relief measures so that the Chinese laborers can maintain their livelihoods after returning to their hometowns.

### The United Council of Japanese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Held a Meeting the Day Before Yesterday

According to the Japanese-language Daily News, the United Council of Japanese Chambers of Commerce and Industry held on the 12th discussed: 1. Consolidating the foundation and organization of the United Council and increasing supervisory committee members; 2. Deliberating on holding the United Council more than once every other year; 3. The tariff case against China; 4. The opening of Lianyungang (連雲港); 5. Fully supplying Japan with Chinese goods and fully importing and selling Japanese goods in China, with special attention to increasing Japanese trade in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and restoring Japanese commercial loans. It will submit the resolved cases to the Japanese government. The meeting adjourned at 4:50 p.m. At 7:00 p.m. in the evening, a dinner party was held on the third floor of the Japanese Club. In addition to the attending members and the local Japanese press, well-known figures in Shanghai such as Wang Xiaoji (王曉籍), Du Yuesheng (杜月笙), Zhang Xiaolin (張嘯林), Liu Hongsheng (劉鴻生), Zhou Zuomin (周作民), Lin Tanghou (林唐侯), and Rong Zongjing (榮宗敬), among others, were invited. First, Chairman Yoshida delivered a speech on behalf of the Japanese side. Then, Wang Xiaoji, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, gave a reply on behalf of the Chinese guests, generally saying that China and Japan are of the same race and share the same culture. They should encourage each other to coexist and prosper and enhance the friendship between China and Japan. Since the "September 18th Incident" (九一八) and the "January 28th Incident" (一二八), Chinese and Japanese commerce and industry have suffered great blows. In the future, both sides should take into account their respective interests so that the development of trade between China and Japan can be expected. In particular, it is necessary to establish a position of equality and mutual benefit as a prerequisite, especially to preserve China's territorial integrity and respect China's sovereignty. Judging from the recent speech of Foreign Minister Sato, he has deeply felt that the solution of outstanding issues between China and Japan must first change its direction. It is deeply hoped that the Sino-Japanese problem will be solved satisfactorily in the future. The third and final meeting held on the 13th discussed the following major cases: 1. The case of reducing telegram fees between China and Japan proposed by the Qingdao Chamber of Commerce and Industry; 2. The case of requiring equal treatment of railway freight for Japanese and Chinese factory products proposed by Jinan (濟南); 3. The case of increasing the number of commercial officials stationed in various parts of China; 4. The case of Japanese goods entering and exiting Sichuan (四川).

### The Success of the Three-Section Navigation on the Sichuan River Opens a New Route at Kongling

Resolved to Conduct Trial Navigation as Soon as the Reefs at the Beachhead are Blasted Away. The New Method of Moving Over the Beach Reduces Time and Lowers Freight Rates.

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Minsheng Industrial Company (民生實業公司), in view of the drop in water level in the Sichuan River (川江), created a new method of three-section navigation: Yichang (宜昌) to Miaohe (廟河) is the lower section, Miaohe to Wanxian (萬縣) is the middle section, and Wanxian to Chongqing (重慶) is the upper section. ㊀ Because the Yichang to Miaohe section must pass through Kongling (崆嶺), only ships of 120 feet or less can be dispatched, using the Minfu (民福), Minzhi (民治), Minan (民安), Minyu (民裕), and Minxuan (民選) ships; ㊁ The Miaohe to Wanxian section has dangerous shoals such as Qingtan (青灘) and Xinglongtan (興隆灘), so ships with a length of 150 feet and strong horsepower are assigned, using the Minsheng (民生), Minkang (民康), and Minduo (民鐸) ships; ㊂ Because there are many well-known shallow shoals in the Wanxian to Chongqing section, only ships with a length of 135 feet or less and a shallow draft can be equipped, using the Minlai (民來), Minsu (民蘇), Minxi (民熙), Minyun (民運), Minheng (民亨), and Minyi (民意) ships. It has been quite effective since its implementation. From January 9th to now, the amount of goods transferred up and down has been no less than 50,000 pieces, and the number of passengers has been more than 10,000. In the implementation of moving over the beach, Qingtan is in Yichang. When the water level is below zero degrees, the water is turbulent and the river is cut off. The slope has a difference of seven or eight feet, and only one line of Nancao (南漕) is navigable. The huge water force and the surging waves are like thunder. Even ships with strong horsepower find it difficult to go upstream. When the water level in Yichang fell to seven feet, because the insurance company did not agree to go up and down Qingtan, it moved this to move over the beach, still maintaining the principle of three-section navigation, that is, moving the center of transshipment to Qingtan. Ships traveling between Xuanchan (宣昌) and Miaohe are rerouted to the lower reaches of Qingtan, and ships traveling between Miaohe and Wanxian are rerouted to the upper reaches of Qingtan. The previous routes for moving over the beach with ships were the first line from Shehongqi (射洪磧) on the north bank to the line entrance on the beach, and the second line from Liushuwan (柳樹灣) on the south bank to the line entrance on the beach. These two lines were extremely rugged and tortuous. Each piece cost four or five yuan, and it took one hour to move one piece. However, the company opened another route for moving over the beach, reducing the distance from five li to half a li. The moving cost is two yuan per piece, and both the insurance company and the passengers are very satisfied.

Opening New Waterways

The water conditions of the Sichuan River are special, with whirlpools and bubbles, and are ever-changing. The waterways are dangerous, with hidden reefs and shallow sandbars, making it a world-famous dangerous waterway. Driving skills must be implemented according to the different water conditions and riverbeds. This is very different from the driving techniques of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. In previous years, the ships that encountered disasters were the Reisheng (瑞生), Fulai (福來), Pingfu (平福), and Fuyuan (福遠) ships in Kongling, and the Shuhe (蜀和) and Lao Shu Tong (老蜀通) ships in Xintan (新灘), which were all unavoidable facts. In order to explore new waterways in Kongling Beach, the company has repeatedly invited captains to explore the river and study the driving methods and the waterways through which they pass, and has driven small steamers up and down several times for trial navigation. The results were very satisfactory. As soon as the Xunjiang (巡江) Division blows up the reefs blocking the center of the river at the beachhead, it will conduct a formal trial navigation. There are two entrances to the Kongling Beach, one is the North Cao (北漕), which is the current navigable entrance, and the other is the South Cao (南漕), which is the newly opened entrance. From now on, the danger of Kongling has been completely overcome by manpower, that is, when the water is dry to two feet below zero degrees, the route between Yi and Yu (渝) can also be directly navigated smoothly.

### Government-Designated Hospitals

Effective Drug Rehabilitation Requires Enrolling in Approved Programs

The government strictly enforces drug prohibition, and the laws and decrees are strict. The Director-General of Drug Prohibition and the local Public Security Bureau and health authorities have long issued notices ordering compliance, and two municipal drug rehabilitation hospitals have been specially established (Duojia Road in the South City (南市多稼路), Qingyun Road in Zhabei (閘北靑雲路)). In addition, the following hospitals already registered with the Health Bureau have been selected: the First Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society, Tiren Hospital, Shengsheng Hospital, Labor Hospital, Tongde Hospital, Southeast Hospital, Yanzhe Hospital, Pingmin Sanatorium, Nanyang Hospital at Xiaodongmen (小東門南洋醫院), Qu Zhibu Hospital (瞿直甫醫院), Bethel Hospital, Zhongde Hospital, Specialized Tourist Sanatorium, Shanghai-Taicang Sanatorium (滬太療養院), Hongqiao Sanatorium, Pudong Jiqun Hospital, Municipal Hospital in the Central District, and Municipal Hunan Hospital (i.e., Shanghai Hospital), Municipal Jiangwan Hospital, and Municipal Wusong Hospital, a total of twenty-one hospitals, also handle drug rehabilitation matters. After successful rehabilitation, a rehabilitation certificate is issued for proof. It has been found that in this city, there are many unregistered private hospitals that often use the name of assisting the government and strictly enforcing drug prohibition, publishing advertisements everywhere to promote their services in order to attract patients and profit from them. It is important to know that it is impossible to verify whether smokers in these private hospitals have truly been rehabilitated. Therefore, the government does not recognize the validity of the rehabilitation certificates issued and will still impose a drug crime on them. It is hoped that all smokers seeking rehabilitation should pay attention and not be deceived.

### The Revenue from Freight of the China Merchants Bureau Increased Sharply in January

Since the reorganization of the state-run China Merchants Bureau, the revenue from freight has increased sharply month by month. According to the bureau's announcement, the revenue from freight and passenger transport in January of this year was 1,066,942.54 yuan in national currency. The revenue for the same month last year was 544,835.25 yuan, an increase of 96 percent, almost doubling the amount. This is a good sign of the development of state-run shipping.

### Applications for Correcting Errors in Land Value Tax Licenses are Permitted

The County Government Issued a Public Notice Yesterday

According to the Rural News Agency, the Shanghai County's second-term land value tax notice will be issued shortly. If there are errors in the first term, the owner can apply for correction. The county government issued Public Notice No. 131 yesterday, stating, "I have received Instruction No. 2590 from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance regarding the request to correct errors in the land value tax register for this year's term that do not match the household's application, resulting in late payment and a request to waive the late fee. The instruction states, 'It is hereby acknowledged that if there are errors in the area, tax rate, etc. listed on the land value tax notice, and an application for correction is made before the deadline, the late fee will be waived. If the application for correction is made after the deadline, the late fee will still be levied as a restriction. Please comply with this order.' Therefore, it should be complied with. In addition to ordering the Land Tax Collection Office to comply, this notice is hereby issued for general knowledge."

### The Gold Exchange Brokers Association Held a General Meeting of Members Yesterday

Amending the Articles of Association and Re-electing Officers

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Gold Exchange Brokers Association of this city held a general meeting of all members at its clubhouse on North Wuxi Road (北無錫路) at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to re-elect officers and discuss important association affairs. Representatives from 39 companies, including Dingkang, Dadecheng, Houchangyong, Zhubao, Hongli, and Xianghe, a total of more than 40 people, attended. After Chairman Zhan Liansheng (詹蓮生) finished his report, the discussion began. ㊀ Article 10 of the association's articles of association stipulates that there are 19 officers in the board of officers. As the association now has a total of 71 members, which is 50 fewer than the previous term, and the affairs of the association are relatively simple, it is not easy to have more than half of the officers attend the board meeting. If the positions are vacant, it would be better to reduce the number of seats in order to facilitate matters and improve the efficiency of association affairs. It is proposed to amend Article 10 of the articles of association, changing the number of officers from 19 to 11. Resolved and passed. ㊁ The industry is sluggish, and gold companies are closing down one after another, resulting in a decrease in the association's members and a shortage of membership fee income. In addition, some members have not paid their membership fees, or although they have not closed down, their addresses are unknown and it is impossible to collect the fees. How should this be handled? Resolved, the board of directors is requested to assist in recovering the fees. ㊂ Please ask the exchange to restore the old commission and reduce the margin. Resolved and passed. Then, Shi Jiafu (士家福), Zhan Yunsheng (詹運生), Feng Qing'an (馮清庵), Gao Qiumei (高秋眉), Zhang Zhumi (張竹彌), Yu Junfu (兪鈞甫), Ge Zhifen (葛志奮), Wang Fusheng (王福生) and other eleven people were re-elected as officers, and Xie Bingquan (謝秉泉), He Shaozhen (賀紹眞), and He Guangsheng (何廣生) were elected as alternate officers. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 p.m. with refreshments.

### China Oil Lamp Company Adds Capital (with picture)

Kong Xiangxi Hosts Banquet for Various Circles Yesterday

The China Oil Lamp Company, organized by Mr. Kong Xiangxi, manufactures pressure oil lamps and stoves invented by Zhong Ling, using vegetable oil as fuel. It produces no coal smell or smoke poisoning, and can recover the squandered cost of kerosene. Since its launch, it has been well-received by the Chinese people, and the government has also encouraged and promoted it. In order to expand its equipment and increase production, the company continued to raise additional capital. Mr. Kong held a banquet at the Central Bank Club yesterday noon, inviting people from the city's financial circles. More than half of the shares were subscribed on the spot, and it was decided to collect the full amount within two days to proceed actively. The details are recorded as follows:

Invited Persons

Those who were invited yesterday included Song Hanzhang, Xu Kan, Zou Lin, Ye Fuxiao, Wang Shaoxian, Zhou Zuomin, Wu Yunzhai, Hu Bijang, Gu Yigu, Ye Zhuotang, Zhou Zongliang, Guo Shun, Zhang Weiru, Lu Zidong, Song Zi'an, Wang Boyuan, Qi Yunqing, Xu Maotang, Zhang Rongpu, Xu Xinliu, Xu Jiyun, Ye Gongchuo, Zhuang Songfu, Kong Shiqin, Chen Jian'an, Xi Demao, Li Zhilian, Zhang Nachuan, Chen Shuyun, Guo Bingwen, Lao Jingxiu, Wang Boqi, Cui Weiwei, and Qu Jigang. They were received by company directors Chen Zuyi, Yao Shoukang, Xiao Hechang, Wu Liande, and the inventor Zhong Ling, etc. The banquet was held in the main hall, with many oil lamps placed on the tables. On the left side of the room was a table displaying various oil lamps and stoves, various raw materials, and oil-based materials. Detailed explanations were given for each of these. Various slogans hung on the walls attracted attention.

Mr. Kong's Speech

During the banquet, Chairman Kong Xiangxi gave a speech. He first said, "Today, I have invited you all here for the China Oil Lamp Company. I am very grateful for your presence. This is the Central Bank Club. Because it has not been established for long, I am afraid that few people know about it. As the president, I welcome you all to come and rest here in your spare time." He then spoke about the oil lamp company, saying, "Most of the lamps used in our country today were invented by foreigners. In cities, we use electric lights, but in rural areas, we mostly use kerosene lamps. Foreigners created the Mei Foo lamp to promote kerosene sales, and it has spread throughout our country. However, this kind of oil lamp contains coal toxins that invisibly poison the people. In the past, Shanxi Province had a disease that affected women after childbirth. Research has found that it was caused by poisoning. In terms of economics, the annual kerosene expenditure is a loss of more than ten million yuan. This kind of consumption is a major problem for our country's economy. Although our country has oil reserves, they have not yet been exploited. Therefore, I paid attention to this early on. When I was the Minister of Industry, I established a research institute to study the daily necessities of the people, hoping to make some inventions. At that time, Mr. Zhong Ling invented the typewriter and applied for a patent with the ministry. I paid great attention to it. Before the September 18th Incident, Wu Xiangchen, a representative of the Northeast soybean industry, came to Beijing to discuss the soybean business. I instructed him to seek development in terms of usage. Therefore, I assigned technician Xiao Hechang to study with Mr. Zhong. When I returned to China from Europe, the pressure oil lamp had already been successfully developed. Later, the oil refining results were also excellent. Therefore, I initiated the organization of the company. At that time, the capital raised was only more than 70,000 yuan. Now, in order to expand, we plan to raise a total of 150,000 yuan. I hope you will all subscribe enthusiastically and promote it." Then, Zhuang Songfu and Lao Jingxiu gave speeches. More than 50,000 yuan was subscribed on the spot. The event ended at 4:00 PM.

The advantages of various lamps and stoves are bright light, easy to use, no smoke, lamp shades are not easily darkened, and oil is very economical. The storm lamps are very suitable for military use, and the Ministry of Military Affairs has already ordered a lot of them. As for the company's expansion, it will continue to research and create kerosene lamps for use in living rooms, etc. There are also many types of oil stoves that have been successfully developed and can also be mass-produced. A total of 400,000 oil lamps have been sold in the past year.

Memorial Oration

On this fourteenth day of March in the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, Lu Jingshi and others from the National Postal Workers' Union, with humble offerings of grain and pure wine, pay tribute to the spirit of our deceased friend, Comrade Zhao Shusheng. Alas, from a distinguished clan in Yue, a family of splendor and honor; a famous figure in Zhejiang, a guest often found in the Tianyi Pavilion. With outstanding talent, born with the auspiciousness of the mountains; with superior intellect, possessing the aspiration of a bright sun entering the river. Alas, our esteemed friend, with discerning taste, readily took on responsibilities. Possessing extensive knowledge, he endured hardship in learning, becoming a role model for teachers with his exemplary conduct. Initially hidden from the world, he later gained renown in jurisprudence. With sharp intellect, he advocated for innovation. Engaged in affairs of state, he sought solace in his free spirit during national crises. He single-handedly managed the school, resolving labor disputes with thoughtful words. Thus, those who knew him welcomed him as an esteemed guest, and colleagues from afar did not hesitate to visit him. Alas, he should have enjoyed a long life, yet at the age of just over thirty, his coffin is sealed. Thousands of friends shed tears of sympathy. Jingshi and others, with bonds deeper than flesh and bone, feel grief beyond words, unable to repay his kindness. On this auspicious day, we solemnly gather our comrades, emulating Yu Zishan's longing for the past, feeling utterly desolate, reading Lu Pingyuan's lament for the departed. May your spirit come and partake in this offering.

Local Memorials

The National Postal Workers' Union believes that Comrade Zhao devoted himself to union affairs during his lifetime, with outstanding achievements. The ninth standing committee meeting resolved to issue a notice to postal unions in various locations to hold memorial services on the same day to express their sorrow. Postal unions in Fuzhou, Xiamen, Wuzhou, Guangzhou, Shantou, Yantai, Jinan, Qingdao, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Tongshan, Tianjin, Kaifeng, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, Xi'an, Changsha, Hankou, Nanchang, Zhennan, Nanning, Yin County, and other places have complied and will hold memorial services locally at 2:00 PM today.

### Yongxin Ship Disaster: Continued Talks Yesterday

Resolution to Sell Yongxin for Aftermath Settlement

Based on the previous meeting's decisions, the Yongshun Company officials and representatives of the victims' families were invited to the meeting to discuss the aftermath of the case. He hoped that both parties would treat each other with sincerity in order to resolve the matter as soon as possible. Subsequently, Yongshun Company manager Zhang Deqing stood up and stated that the company deeply regretted the unfortunate incident and that he would do his best to handle the aftermath. After various representatives expressed their opinions and discussed, it was resolved that the Yongshun Company would sell the Yongxin ship and use the proceeds to handle the aftermath of the case. The method would be divided into: (1) constructing a monument at the accident site, (2) performing rituals for the deceased, and (3) compensating the victims' families. As for the method of sale, it was decided that the company, the victims' families, and the Hu Association would each appoint a representative to handle it together. However, the Yongshun Company still had outstanding debts, which the company would find other ways to repay and could not use the proceeds from the sale of the Yongxin ship. Company representative Zhang Deqing indicated his acceptance and promised to contact the company's board of directors for further reply.

### Paramount Creditors' Meeting Proceeds with Bankruptcy Proceedings

Second Creditors' Meeting Yesterday: Gu Zhengji and Others as Supervisors

The Shanghai First Special District Court is proceeding with the bankruptcy case of the Paramount Hotel. The first creditors' meeting, convened in December of last year, passed a conciliation plan. However, three foreign creditors, including the O'Moore Orchestra, raised objections, and the conciliation plan was rejected by the court and not approved. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the second creditors' meeting was reconvened. The details are as follows:

Attending Creditors

Yesterday's creditors' meeting was still held at the Qinghua Alumni Association in Jincheng Villa on Jing'an Temple Road. In attendance were Judge Jiang Gongliang from the First Special Court, bankruptcy administrator Accountant An Shaoyun, lawyer Liu Shifang, and creditors' representatives from Xinhua Bank, Shanghai Bank, Jardine Matheson, Tongren Law Firm, Cihui Company, Shanghai Electric Power Company, Gu Zhengji, and Huang Mingji (transferees of the claims of the three foreign creditors O'Moore, DeLynn, and Ward), etc. A total of 96 creditors' representatives (the Shenbao reported 137), representing a total claim of more than 282,400 yuan (the Shenbao reported 282,854.22 yuan).

Chairman's Report

Chairman Judge Jiang Gongliang reported that the previous conciliation plan was not approved due to objections from creditors. Today's second creditors' meeting was convened to discuss the bankruptcy proceedings. According to bankruptcy law, the first step is to elect supervisors to assist the administrator in the bankruptcy proceedings. Next, Accountant An reported on the number of creditors present and the amount of claims, which were sufficient to hold a creditors' meeting.

Election of Supervisors

After the report, a vote was held to elect supervisors. As a result of the vote count, Gu Zhengji and Yuan Xingyuan were elected. The chairman then adjourned the meeting. After the creditors dispersed, the bankruptcy administrator invited the elected supervisors to hold a discussion to discuss the bankruptcy proceedings.

Asset Situation

According to a report from a Datong News Agency reporter, the Paramount Hotel was established in the name of the Dacheng Company. After the closure, all of its assets were publicly auctioned by the court last year, yielding more than 30,000 yuan, which is currently being held by the court. There are no other assets on the site. However, the directors and supervisors of the Dacheng Company should be jointly and severally liable according to law.

Flames Soar

### Straw Sheds in Wujia Hall, Pudong, Destroyed Simultaneously

Fire Started at Gao Laoda's Home; 400-500 Victims

In the Wujia Hall area at the eastern end of Yangjia Zhai, Pudong, south of the North Hutung Road, there is a piece of open space with an area of dozens of acres. Over the past ten years, migrant workers from various parts of Jiangbei and Shandong have moved in and built straw sheds as shelters. As time went on, more and more sheds were built, and now there are hundreds of straw sheds, scattered in various places, becoming a concentration camp for poor migrant workers. At about 11:30 yesterday noon, at the home of Gao Laoda from Gaoyou, Gao's wife was cooking with a child in her arms. Suddenly, the child cried, and Gao's wife took the child out of the door and handed it to her husband to hold. Unexpectedly, when she returned inside, she suddenly saw that the bamboo fence near the stove was on fire. In a moment of panic, she was about to run out to call for help when the flames shot through the roof of the shed, turning into a raging fire. Moreover, with the urgent south wind, the fire swept across the ground, and in an instant, several sheds on both sides were turned into ashes. The Pudong District and Yangjiadu fire brigades immediately dispatched teams to the scene to put out the fire. However, in the straw shed community, with people helping the old and carrying the young, either rushing to escape or salvaging their belongings, the order was very chaotic. Subsequently, Pudong Branch Chief Zhang Mingqin and Yangjing District Defense Corps Chief Xu Jiming led their subordinates to the scene to suppress the situation, advising the victims to first give way to the firefighters. When they concentrated on fighting the fire, five or six straw sheds relatively far away were ignited when the wind blew large pieces of burning debris onto them. Thus, fires broke out on all sides. The firefighters, seeing the unfavorable environment, with their attempts to put out the fire surrounded by flames, nearly unable to escape, risked pushing the fire trucks out of the fire and then devising a way to put out the fire again. At this time, a row of straw sheds built against the wall of the Kezhi Iron Factory on the North Hutung Road, more than ten feet away from the fire, also caught fire. The firefighters, struggling to extinguish the fire, had to turn back to the North Hutung to put out the fire, expending great effort. It was not until about 2:30 PM that the fires were gradually extinguished. A total of about 70-80 straw sheds were burned down in the fire area, 5-6 along North Hutung Road, and 6 shops with tiled roofs were charred. The estimated total loss is about 4,000-5,000 yuan. Counting an average of two families per victim household, there were 150-160 victim households. Counting an average of three people per family, there were 400-500 homeless elderly and young people. The Kezhi Iron Factory authorities, seeing that the victims had not eaten lunch and were in a pitiful state, specially purchased 1,000 steamed buns from various pastry shops and distributed them at the scene for relief at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Regarding the aftermath of the fire, local leaders such as Branch Chief Zhang Mingqin, Defense Corps Chief Xu Jiming, and Chamber of Commerce Director Xia Xinzai are discussing measures to jointly assist with Shanghai philanthropists. Gao Laoda, who started the fire, has been detained by the police and sent to the General Bureau for interrogation.

### Robbery of Automobile on Hu-Min Road

At the Culvert of the Third Bridge: The Border Section of Songjiang-Shanghai

At 8:05 PM the night before last, a robbery of a motor vehicle occurred at the culvert of the Third Bridge, south of the Qianliang Temple station on the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhao long-distance motor road. The details are recorded as follows: There is a Cuowei New Village located north of the Qianliang Temple station on the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhao Road. In addition to their own cars, residents also have a car provided by the village for transportation. One Shanghai County Public Security Bureau petition police chief and four policemen are stationed in the village and take turns protecting it. At 8:00 PM the night before last, driver Chen Bingquan drove car no. 7214 (rental license no. 7629) to Shanghai as usual to pick up passengers. About five minutes later, while driving past the south end of the Third Bridge (the border area between the city, county, and Songjiang), he saw a person wearing a long coat and a felt hat holding up both hands, blocking the way. At the same time, two people jumped out from both sides, each holding a box cannon, speaking with a Hakka accent, and ordered the car to stop. Chen knew he had encountered robbers and dared not resist. The robbers swarmed up and, seeing that it was an empty car, showed displeasure. They immediately asked if it was the car of someone named Zhang. After the driver replied that it was not, the robbers were disappointed and searched the driver's body, taking away seven yuan in legal tender, three jiao in nickel coins, a bunch of keys, and a police whistle from his pocket. They then got out of the car and ordered him to drive back north, saying that if he did not obey, they would shoot him dead. Chen had no choice but to drive back to the village and report to the accountant, who immediately ordered Police Chief Lu to lead the police to hunt down the robbers. The robbers had already disappeared. The village relief office has prepared a report and submitted it to the public security bureaus of Shanghai City, Shanghai County, and Songjiang County, requesting investigation and protection.

### Chen Afu Conned Gold Bracelet from Female Waitress

Wu Yueqin Received Hell Money; Zhang Agui Borrowed and Sought Revenge

Wu Yueqin, a woman from Yangzhou, 31 years old, was working as a female waitress in the rooftop garden of the Great World department store on Nanjing Road. On the afternoon of November 6th last year, a tourist came to have tea, and Wu served him. The guest claimed to be named Chen Afu, from Ningbo, and was running a silk shop in Hangzhou. He said he had come to Shanghai to collect debts. After talking to Wu for a few words, he paid the tea fee of six jiao and left. Two days later, Chen came to have tea again, and Wu Yueqin still served him. At that time, Chen was carrying a paper package, saying that it contained 380 yuan in legal tender, which he had just received from a client. Because he had nowhere to deposit it, he wanted to temporarily store it with Wu. Although Wu glanced at it briefly, she did not pay attention to the authenticity of the bills. They then went together to Wu's residence upstairs at the Dahua Coal Store on Malan Road in the French Concession. At that time, Chen asked Wu for a handkerchief and personally sewed it up with a needle, hiding it inside the drawer. Chen kept the key. The two then returned to the Great World department store. Before long, Chen lured Wu to a room in the Zhaoshang Inn at 566 Fuzhou Road under the pretext of going out for snacks. They each had a bowl of soup noodles. At that time, Chen's accomplice Zhang Agui was in the room. As soon as Zhang saw Chen and Wu enter the room, Zhang made an excuse and slipped away. Chen, seeing that Wu was wearing a gold bracelet and a gold ring (worth 70 yuan), used his clever means to claim that the bracelet and ring were fake. Wu insisted that they were real. Unable to resolve the dispute, they summoned a tea server to identify them. The tea server also did not know the authenticity. Chen then forced Wu to take off the bracelet and ring so that he could take them to the jewelry store to identify them. Although Wu expressed her unwillingness, she did not suspect him because Chen had 380 yuan deposited in her home. Unexpectedly, Chen disappeared after getting the items, like a yellow crane. Wu rushed home to check the deposited banknotes and found that they were all hell money. She then realized she had been scammed and reported to the Old Gate Police Station. It was not until 3:30 PM the day before yesterday that Wu spotted Chen Afu in the rooftop garden of the New World department store. She called the police and had Chen Afu arrested and detained in the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a lawsuit against him in accordance with Article 339 of the Criminal Law for fraud and theft, and stated that the defendant had pawned the stolen ornaments at the Laobaohua Jewelry Store on Avenue Edward VII for 65 yuan and shared it with the fugitive Zhang Agui. He requested a postponement because Zhang was on the run. Wu Yueqin also testified about the circumstances of the fraud. Chen Afu confessed that Zhang Agui had an affair with Wu and spent a lot of money. Zhang borrowed money from Wu but was unsuccessful, so he came up with this scheme. Afterward, I received 20 yuan, he said. Judge Ye Shengchao reviewed the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained and interrogated again in seven days.

### Small Pharmacies Selling Aphrodisiacs

Police First Collect Evidence; Detention Approved Pending Prosecution

Recently, small pharmacies in Shanghai have been selling various aphrodisiacs, creating clever names and advertising them in newspapers. These drugs are very harmful to the health of young people. The Public Concession Police Department attaches great importance to this and has sent Chief Detective Zhang Yuanjing of the Old Gate Police Station, General Patrol Inspector Zhang Xiaolin, and political department detective Deng Hailin to conduct a thorough investigation. As a result, it was found that the Welisheng ointment sold by Yonghua Pharmacy at 512 Tianjin Road, the Hualigen ointment sold by Shenzhou Pharmacy at 492 Tianjin Road, the Bushen Qingxue Pills sold by Guizhou Pharmacy at 107 Guizhou Road, the Aihua Gujing Pills issued by Aihua Pharmaceutical Factory at 221 Chudo Road, and the Zaibiwei sold at Room 217, Zhonghe Building, 176 Shanxi Road, were all disguised aphrodisiacs. They applied to the First Special District Court and signed a search warrant, and on the afternoon of the 11th, they went to search each place. They copied 13 packages of Welisheng ointment, 79 empty packages, 43 packages of Hualigen ointment, 21 empty packages, 96 bottles of Bushen Qingxue Pills, 465 bottles of Aihua Gujing Pills, and 150 boxes of Zaibiwei, and brought them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent by car to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu requested the court to approve the detention so that they could investigate and study after clarification. Judge Shen Shanzeng reviewed the report and approved the detention of the seized items.

### Rising Cost of Living Leads to Reduced Meat Consumption

Compared to the Same Period Last Year, Calves, Pigs, and Sheep Have All Decreased Sharply

Recently, prices in Shanghai have soared, the cost of living has increased, and residents' livelihoods are not as affluent as in the past. The reduction in meat consumption year by year is the most profound reflection of this. According to a survey by the Public Works Department's health department, the number of slaughterings of various meats in January of this year has decreased sharply. Compared with the same period last year, the number of pig slaughterings decreased by 27.36%, sheep decreased by 54.56%, goats decreased by 54.20%, cattle decreased by 1.40%, and calves (small cattle) decreased by 4.62%. Therefore, the work of the slaughterhouse is much more leisurely than in previous years.

Chief Prosecutor Du Baoqi specially appointed Prosecutor Lei Binzhang to conduct the trial. After interrogation, they were ordered to be detained for further investigation.

### Six-Decade-Old Man Qian Fusheng Admits Acquaintance But Denies Parentage

Deng Qiongzhen Forms a Small Family and Has a Son; Criminal Case Becomes a Civil Matter, Urging Resolution

Qian Nansheng, a Cantonese man in his sixties, runs a foreign goods import and export business in Shanghai. Over the years, he has become relatively well-off, but lacks an heir. In his residence at 58 East Broadway Road, he has both a wife and concubines, none of whom have borne him children. Therefore, in past years, he

Adopted a Son

To enjoy his twilight years. There was a young Cantonese woman named Deng Qiongzhen, aged thirty-nine, from a humble background. Ten years ago, she was employed in a wine shop in Hongkou, working as a cook. Qian was fond of alcohol and went there daily to drink, becoming familiar with the woman. Over time, their hearts grew closer. In the spring of the year before last, Qian followed in the footsteps of Sima Xiangru and formed a small family with this wine shop girl at 19 Qiujiang Road,

Beginning Cohabitation

At that time, to avoid disapproval from his wife and concubines at home, he used the alias "Pan" and registered the household with the relevant police station. Before long, Deng became pregnant, and on January 19th of last year, she gave birth to a son. Qian, overjoyed at having an heir in his old age, quickly returned to his hometown in Guangdong. Following local customs, he

Celebrated with Tangyuan

But on the one hand, he forbade Deng from breastfeeding the child with her own milk, nor would he allow her to hire a wet nurse. He exclusively purchased milk powder and various fruit juices to feed the child. When Deng questioned him about this, he would deflect with other excuses. The cost of milk powder and fruit juices each month was considerable, but Qian was not stingy. Until last winter, when the child was over one year old, Qian suddenly appointed Lawyer Dai and

Sent Two Letters

To Deng, inviting her to his office to talk. There, Lawyer Dai told her that Qian Fusheng wanted to take the child to raise him himself, and that he no longer intended to support Deng's future life. Only then did Deng realize that Qian had forbidden her from breastfeeding the child in order to make it easier to take the child back at this time and raise him himself. Deng immediately expressed her opposition, and Qian immediately stopped her living expenses and stopped supplying milk powder and fruit juices. Forced, Deng temporarily relied on her friend's place with the child and hired a lawyer to file a

Criminal Self-Complaint

Against Qian in the Shanghai First Special District District Court for abandoning his biological son. During the court hearing, Qian firmly denied that the child was his, resulting in a question of identity. The criminal court judge ordered Deng to first file a case in the civil court to confirm the identity of the biological son before reviewing whether the crime of abandonment was established. At 3:00 PM yesterday, Civil Court Judge Luo Can specially opened the Fourth Tribunal to summon both parties to investigate the part confirming identity. Deng Qiongzhen, as the legal guardian of her son Yaoguang,

Brought the Child to Court

Describing the process of her relationship with Qian Fusheng. Her lawyer, Gan Lin, explained in detail that the defendant used aliases when renting houses and sending letters to the plaintiff in Guangdong and Hong Kong, and the reason for not allowing the plaintiff to breastfeed the child. He stated that all of this showed that the defendant was truly cruel and heartless to the plaintiff. Judge Luo questioned the defendant, Qian Fusheng, who admitted that he and Deng

Were Only Acquainted

And there was absolutely no evidence of fathering a child. Hearing this, Deng's face immediately turned angry, and she shouted in Cantonese, pointing and scolding, "Old thief!" "More than an old thief!" The court immediately stopped her, and the judge told the defendant that this was something you did, and you should know it in your heart. If this child is really yours, you should go outside and quickly settle it yourself. But Qian repeatedly shook his head, and his lawyer stated on his behalf that the defendant, seeing himself as old and childless, was very willing to take the plaintiff's child as an adopted son. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff demanded several thousand dollars in exchange and hired a Bai Xiangren to threaten him. If the plaintiff could

Reduce the Amount

There would still be room for negotiation. The plaintiff's lawyer then declared that the plaintiff's demands were: ㊀ The plaintiff would raise the child until he was sixteen years old and return him to the defendant, confirming that he was the defendant's biological son; ㊁ The defendant should be responsible for supporting the plaintiff until she was sixty years old. The court then adjourned and scheduled another hearing for 3:00 PM on the 31st of this month.

Large and small villages have been disturbed almost entirely, especially Yuetan, which was robbed, houses were burned, people were killed, and losses were huge.

Jin Dafu, from Jiangbei, lives at 18 Taiping Bridge, French Concession, and makes a living by pulling a rickshaw. At around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, Jin Dafu was pulling an empty rickshaw with license number 2039 when three men greeted him at the intersection of Dunlun Road and Bazi Road. They claimed that a certain foreigner in the toilet wanted to go to a brothel and asked Jin to lead the way. Jin Dafu, knowing that such things often happened in that area, parked his rickshaw outside and peeked inside. He saw a foreigner in the toilet, but because they did not understand each other's language, he could not understand what was happening. Jin then exited and intended to ask the three men outside to act as interpreters, but unexpectedly, all three men had left. Only another man was standing on the steps across the street, looking at the rickshaw. Jin found that the seat cushion was missing, and the more than 200 copper coins he had earned from his hard work, which he kept under the seat, were also gone. Only then did he realize that he had fallen victim to a planned robbery. Jin Dafu was extremely anxious and had no way to deal with it, so he went into the toilet and grabbed the foreigner, intending to ask the police station for help. But the foreigner pretended to be drunk and tangled with Jin. Jin Dafu was unable to overcome him and the foreigner escaped. He had no choice but to report to the Hongkou Police Station and request assistance.

Huang Runzhou, 24 years old, from Pudong, works at the Huiye Bank in Shanghai and rents a house at 458 Damuqiao Road in the new southwestern district of Shanghai, where he lives with his wife and five other family members.

Everyone was awakened from their dreams and shouted for help. The robbers became angry and fired a shot, hitting Huang Runzhou in the left side of his lower abdomen. The bullet did not pass through, and he fell to the ground in extreme pain, bleeding profusely. The robbers ransacked the house, stealing two gold pocket watches, one gold wristwatch, cash, and clothing worth about 300-400 yuan (because the family members were flustered, they did not have time to inspect the losses in detail). The robbers fled south with the stolen goods, disappearing without a trace. Afterward, Huang's family members rushed the injured Huang to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, he had lost too much blood and the injury was critical, endangering his life. The Xinxi District Police Substation of the district reported to the bureau and immediately dispatched police officers to investigate. At the same time, the French Concession Police also received a report from the hospital and went to the scene of the incident to investigate, recovering a spent shell casing, which they took back to the police station for analysis and issued a wanted notice for the robbers.

### Female Corpse Found in Weeds on Wasteland on Poyang Road in East Shanghai

Letters Found on Corpse Identify Her as Zhou Gan; Shandong Man Suspected of Beating Her to Death

At around 6:00 AM on the 11th of this month, a passerby, Zhu Jinlin, discovered a female corpse in the weeds on the wasteland on Poyang Road in East Shanghai. She was lying face down in the weeds with a fractured back of the head. He reported it to the Yangshupu Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. They found a large rock next to the corpse, with bloodstains on it, which was likely used to hit the woman's head. A man's cotton robe was found more than ten feet away from the corpse. A letter was also found on the corpse. Based on this letter, they found Zhu Zhai of 1150 Meizhou Road and Ji Chen of 158 Glen Road, who were both acquaintances of the deceased. After the two identified her, it was learned that her name was Zhou Yu, from Shaoxing. Her husband's name is Zhou Liankun, who is currently in his hometown. The deceased had gone to Zhu Zhai's house with a Shandong man a few days ago, but the two suddenly left on bad terms. Therefore, the man is highly suspected of being responsible for the woman's death. The police station is currently investigating. The body was taken to the Fielun Road Mortuary by detectives. Yesterday morning, Song Genshan, a prosecutor from the First Special District District Court, arrived at the mortuary to examine the body. After questioning the witnesses and confirming the previous circumstances, Song ruled that the deceased Zhou Yu was a woman who had been suffocated by someone holding her head down, and then her skull was smashed, causing her death. The body was handed over to Pushan Villa for burial.

### Shanghai YMCA Membership Drive Opens at City Hall Yesterday

He is especially grateful to the team leaders, team members, and donors for attending today. He noted that there are over 400 people present, all of whom are pillars of Shanghai society, and that society and its members share common interests and therefore need to contribute and serve. If everyone can do this, then society has hope. He noted that the gentlemen are serving as team leaders and team members of the membership drive today, which is a display of selflessness, and that they can devote their spare time to contributing to society, which is fortunate for society. He said that the Shanghai YMCA's slogan for this membership drive is unity and self-improvement, and that China has suffered from disunity in the past, but since the unification of Guangdong and Guangxi last year, and despite the Xi'an Incident, the country has remained united. This shows that the government and the people, and the people and the government, have become one, and that the Chinese people are in good spirit in the world. Therefore, he said that the 26th year of the Republic of China is the year that the Chinese people can hold their heads high in the world, but that he dare not be complacent, and must continue to work hard and move forward with the slogan of unity and self-improvement. He is confident that the Shanghai YMCA's membership drive this year will be successful and will exceed its target. After the speech, the YMCA President Zhang Jiafu gave a thank-you speech.

### Chinese and Russian Criminals Sentenced to Six Months for Fraud

The White Russian Bi Falinge, who owns a jewelry store on Avenue Joffre in Shanghai, took the translator Li Bingzhong to Fuzhou, claiming to open a jewelry store.

After selling the goods, they returned to Shanghai by boat. Chen Aqian and others later found out that the foreign gold was made of soil and had been transformed into gold through some process, but it could only deceive for a short time, and it would eventually revert back to its original state and become soil again. They reported it to the local Public Security Bureau, which urgently telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Government, which detained Bi Falinge and Li Bingzhong at the District Court when the ship arrived in Shanghai.

### Achieving True Unification Through Economic Construction

— Du Chongyuan

Premier Sun often said: "Without public trust, mutual trust cannot arise." If we were to make the people of the whole country believe in one doctrine, perhaps the common people would not understand it very well. If we were to say that China needs to build so many large industries and factories, and the majority of intellectuals in the country would be gathered in this industrial construction, I think the doctrine would be understood without even talking about it. For example, a frog in a well, it says that the sky is small, no matter how you explain to it that the sky is large, it will not believe it. If you take it outside the well, you don't have to explain, it will naturally admit that the sky is large. The way the environment controls life is the same principle. For China to truly embark on the path of construction, bringing together all the talents in the world, it would be feared that it would not be enough, how could there be the joke that graduation is unemployment! Where does reaction come from? Then, when we talk about politics, whether it is the central government, the provinces, or the counties, we all implement politics based on construction plans. When we talk about education, whether it is the university, middle school, or primary school, we all run education based on construction plans. When we talk about culture, whether it is newspapers, magazines, movies, or storytelling, we all advocate culture based on construction plans. Then there will only be China and Chinese people, and no so-called reaction, no so-called cliques, is there still no unification in China?

Fortunately, the so-called unification is no longer just empty talk. Thanks to our high-ranking neighbors giving us a heavy lesson, we, the whole country, have made up our minds. From now on, everyone must abandon all prejudices, sacrifice all personal interests, and fight together for national rejuvenation and national survival. Even those who have always held different views from the government have now changed their policies and are willing to gather under the command of Chairman Chiang to complete the unification of the country internally and prepare for national resistance externally. The Third Plenary Session's declaration repeatedly stated the principle of peaceful unification. In his conversation with the Central News Agency, Chairman Chiang further proposed three methods: freedom of speech, release of political prisoners, and concentration of talents. With such a united will and sincere unity, it can be said that it has never been seen in the history of the Republic of China in the past twenty-six years.

These are certainly good signs, but we must not be satisfied with this. I believe that having the determination of the whole country to achieve peaceful unification, although it is the preliminary necessary condition for national unification, it is not enough to complete the great cause of true unification by relying on this determination alone. We must go one step further and start from the facts. In other words, we must build our country into a truly modern democratic country. We have adequate and strong land, sea, and air forces, we have sufficient resources necessary for national life and national defense, we have all the rational political systems that can be called a modern country, so that 490 million people live in a completely different new environment, at that time, no one will be dissatisfied with the current situation, no one will not want to work hard for the interests of the nation. That is to say, building 450 million knives into the world's largest cannon. In this way, there will be no more internal friction and consumption of national power; externally, it will become an unparalleled great force in the world. Are you still afraid that the small invading country cannot be dealt with? Naturally, these words of mine are inevitably too hopeful, but from today onwards, everyone will not settle old scores and work together to work hard on economic construction, and it can be asserted that we will eventually reach this ideal day.

Finally, I am a person who runs a real business. As the saying goes, "Three sentences cannot be separated from the original industry." Perhaps because economic construction is my main business, I have some superficial insights, but the many painful experiences of saving the country in the past few years have also taught me, making me more clearly recognize that to achieve national unification and national rejuvenation, we can only concentrate talents and work hard from economic construction. Otherwise, they are all nonsense. Therefore, I ventured to put forward these insights, hoping that all friends who are concerned about the country and the times will give guidance! (The End)

### United States Retains International Basketball Championship, China Loses Regrettably

Third Match Ends in a Tie at 31, Loses 33 to 36 After Five-Minute Overtime

China's hope of regaining the Shanghai International Cup Basketball Championship has been dashed again, and they must wait at least another year. In the third final match between China and the United States last night, the score was tied at 31 after forty minutes of play. After a five-minute overtime, China lost 33 to 36 by one point, and the championship was retained by the United States for another year. The 700 spectators sighed in unison, feeling extremely sorry.

Loses Regrettably

With one and a half minutes left in the game, China was ahead by one point with a score of 30 to 29. The tension in the air was palpable. Feng Nianhua scored another point from Carson's fourth foul. In a blink of an eye, the game was about to end, and everyone thought that victory was within reach. Unexpectedly, in the last two seconds, Locke threw the ball backwards with both hands and it fell into the net, tying the score at 32. At a critical moment, the crisis was averted, and the Americans congratulated themselves. A five-minute overtime was then played to determine the winner. Both sides showed great anxiety, and the shouts grew louder. Locke scored on a foul by Chen Zongqi, giving the American team another point. However, Cai Yanxiong scored skillfully, adding two points, and China regained the lead with a score of 33 to 32. Unexpectedly, this victorious situation could not be maintained. Locke scored another goal, and in the last ten seconds, he scored two points on a foul, and China ultimately suffered a miserable defeat with a score of 33 to 36.

Leading All the Way

In the first half, the American team was weakened by Locke's poor performance, and Rhine was unable to utilize his height. The Chinese team was in the lead from beginning to end, scoring the first seven points and gaining the upper hand. Wang Nanzhen opened the scoring, followed by Cai Yanxiong, and then Wang Nanzhen scored again, creating a score of seven to zero. At this time, Rhine scored three points, and Brazil was brought in. Piros and Locke made some contributions, and the score gradually became closer. When the score was ten to eleven, only one point behind China, Wang Nanzhen scored from afar. Chen Zongqi replaced Cai Yanxiong and succeeded. In the first half, China led by four points with a score of sixteen to twelve.

Lineup Shakes

After the halftime break, the Chinese team's lineup was slightly adjusted, with Han Zhenyuan and Zhou Dayun replacing Yin Guiren and Kuang Yayao. However, once in contact, this lineup did not perform well. After Zhou Dayun and Feng Nianhua scored two goals, the American team took the opportunity to launch a major offensive. Brazil scored first, and Locke scored five consecutive points, allowing them to tie the score for the first time at twenty each. Yin Guiren was quickly brought back in to replace Han. The momentum of the American team did not diminish, and Piros, Carson, and others added seven points, putting China behind with a score of twenty to twenty-seven. Losing thirteen consecutive points was the Chinese team's most declining period.

Revival Again

Cai Yanxiong was brought back in to replace Yin Guiren, and the Chinese team gradually showed signs of revival. With four minutes left in the game, the Chinese team made a concerted effort, and the situation became unpredictable. Zhou Chanyun and Feng Nianhua each scored a goal, and Chen Zongqi and Cai Yanxiong scored three points on fouls, bringing the score to twenty-eight to twenty-nine, only one point behind. Amidst deafening cheers, Cai Yanxiong scored again, and the Chinese team regained the lead with a score of thirty to twenty-nine, breaking through this difficult situation.

Ultimately Loses

With one and a half minutes left in the game, the air was extremely tense. The Chinese generals intended to delay and tighten their defense, hoping to maintain this one-point victory. The American team tried to seize the ball but failed. Carson lunged at Feng Nianhua and was sent off for his fourth foul. Feng Nianhua scored on the foul, making the score thirty-one to twenty-nine. Everyone thought that victory was assured, but heaven did not help us. Locke's backhanded shot went into the basket, tying the score at thirty-one. In the five-minute overtime, they still lost by three points with a score of thirty-three to thirty. The referees were Zhang Guoxun and Hebbner.

### Municipal Amateur Wrestling Association to Hold Mayor's Cup Wrestling Championship

Rules and Regulations Being Drafted, Registration to Begin Soon

Tong Zhongyi, Wang Ziping, XX Junqing, Zhang Haitong, Qian Ruiwu, Tian Yurong, Li Zhenqing, etc., from the local wrestling community, as well as enthusiastic promoters Chen Xuliang, Tang Hao, Niu Ru'ao, Hong Zhifang, Lü Jigang, Zhu Wenwei, Lü Yaohua, etc., believe that the national essence of wrestling can strengthen the body and build character, cultivate the spirit of hard work, perseverance, and unyieldingness, and is the only sport to revitalize and reverse decline.

### Donghua Protests to the Westerners Football Club That It Has Not Forfeited the Scott Cup

The Westerners Club's Hasty Judgment of Forfeiture Is Almost Arbitrary; Only Asks for Explanation on Whether to Replay Against the British Army

The day before yesterday evening, various newspapers suddenly received a call from the Shanghai Westerners Football Club, stating that "Tomorrow (i.e., yesterday's Scott Cup replay between Donghua and Laoyier has been declared forfeited, and Laoyier has won the finals qualification without effort." The incident was sudden and caused considerable doubt. Yesterday, the person in charge of the Donghua Association solemnly declared that "The Shanghai Westerners Football Club's decision is quite arbitrary, and a serious protest has been filed." This is because the association had sent an official letter on the morning of the day before yesterday, inquiring with the club authorities whether the Group A league match that was stopped midway due to the unreasonable noise of the Shenyuan spectators would be replayed with Laoyier. This is because, according to the football rules, the match cannot be established unless it has been played for ninety minutes. There were sixteen minutes left until the end of the match that day, and it should be replayed as usual. However, the football club authorities had already held a meeting to discuss the matter the day after the incident, but the resolution was not announced, and only a warning letter was sent to Ding Zhaocheng, only explaining that Mr. Ding should not deliberately collide with others (i.e., Mr. Ding was penalized for violently colliding with Ottor after being insulted). As for the outcome of this game, there was only one sentence, so Donghua requested the inquiry in a letter. However, the letter did not state that if it was not suitable to announce, then the Scott Cup replay on the next day (i.e., yesterday) would not be attended and would be postponed until the problem was resolved. Unexpectedly, the club authorities arbitrarily ruled that the Donghua Association had forfeited. In fact, Donghua not only had no intention of forfeiting, but was actively preparing. In addition to formally publishing the lineup last Thursday, Gu Shangquan and Ning Erren were persuaded to rush back from an out-of-town trip the night before yesterday, preparing for yesterday's seat. It was not until yesterday morning that reading the newspaper revealed that the club had decided that Donghua had forfeited. The incident was unexpected, so in addition to filing a serious protest with the club, the process will be made public to relieve the worries of those who care for Donghua.

### Second International Clay Target Shooting Competition: Chinese YMCA Wins Against Japan

Result: 8 to 3, Gu Zhihao Creates a Record of One Shot for 383

In the second International Clay Target Shooting Competition, the Chinese YMCA defeated the Japanese Clay Target Shooting Association by a score of 8 to 3 yesterday at the association. The Japanese are known for their skill in clay target shooting, and the only organization that can compete with them is the Chinese YMCA. In the first competition, the YMCA also narrowly defeated them by a score of five to six. This time, the victory was due to the well-organized lineup and the average strength of the team. Both sides adopted a handicap system. The YMCA's players' target scores were more than those of Japan, with a comparison of seven to four. If the equal competition system is changed, the YMCA players will be more confident. Gu Zhihao created a record of 383 points in one shot, and scored 600 points after five shots, making him a special talent in both the Chinese and Japanese teams.

### Students of St. John's University Request the Board of Trustees to Register with the Government

Presenting Six Major Reasons

Shanghai's St. John's University has the longest history and has produced the most talent among universities in the country. Prominent figures such as Song Ziwen, Yan Huiqing, and Gu Weijun are all graduates of the university. However, due to various reasons, it has not yet registered with the Central Government. The students of the university believe that because the school has not been registered for a long time, graduates are unable to enjoy the various rights that graduates of ordinary universities should enjoy. They have submitted a petition to the board of trustees requesting that they promptly handle the registration to remedy this situation. The original petition is transcribed below:

Petition Regarding Requesting the Registration of Our School: Your esteemed organization, we believe that our school was established a long time ago and is full of talented people. For more than fifty years, St. John's has been important to the country and society. In recent years, because our school has delayed registration, both the school and the students have suffered. Please allow us to present the most obvious reasons on the left: ㊀ Because the school has not yet registered, students are unable to participate in various occupations and examinations held by the government or other organizations, thereby increasing the fear of unemployment. Graduates of the medical school cannot obtain medical licenses, so they cannot practice medicine within the country except in the concessions. ㊁ Graduates serving in various government agencies have been loyal and diligent for many years, but recently, due to the government's review of civil servant qualifications, students who graduated from St. John's are either having their salaries reduced or being dismissed. According to a letter from the Beiping Alumni Association, alumnus Mr. Wu, who was a middle school teacher, was dismissed because his alma mater had not registered and his qualifications were not met. Graduates of St. John's are gradually being excluded from educational institutions. If we do not proceed with registration as soon as possible and allow this situation to develop naturally, where will St. John's students be able to serve in the future? ㊂ Students of St. John's are not allowed to participate in government-sponsored public-funded study abroad examinations. Moreover, even if St. John's students want to study abroad at their own expense, they can only obtain travel permits. Other domestic research institutions also do not accept St. John's students. Not only is employment difficult, but it is also not easy to seek further education. ㊃ Due to financial difficulties in recent years, the school is unable to add or improve various school administration constructions. The number of professors is also small. These difficulties are most acutely felt by the medical school. Dean Mo of the medical school has publicly stated that only after the school is registered can it receive economic assistance from the Ministry of Education, and then it can develop and improve. ㊄ Alumni are very dissatisfied with St. John's delay in registration. Therefore, spiritual and material assistance has gradually decreased in recent years, and the school is increasingly in difficulty. After the school is registered, this situation will no longer exist, and alumni can restore the old outlook for the development of their alma mater. ㊅ Soochow, Shanghai, Jinling, Wenhua, Yanjing, Lingnan and other schools are also run by churches. Now, not only have they all registered, but they have also not lost their religious spirit, and their graduates receive the same treatment as other national universities. Why is only St. John's different? The six points listed above are all clear and easy to see, and the students do not need to explain them further. However, because the interests of the students are closely related, they cannot help but repeat them. Recently, we heard that your esteemed organization has submitted a plan to the church to take over the school in the 25th year in order to proceed with registration immediately. This is what the students are praying for. The students are young and strong, and it is the day to serve the country and society. The school gathers hundreds of students, so how can there not be outstanding talents? If the path to effectiveness is limited due to not registering, it is not only the misfortune of the school and the students, but also a lament for the country and society to lose talent. In short, if the school is not registered for one day, the students will encounter one day of difficulty. The students are born as citizens of China and live on the soil of China. Although they do not want to regard themselves as outside the law, society cannot help but regard them as outside the law. The students have been educated by the school and deeply understand the meaning of patriotism. How can they bear to be different from the citizens of China? Looking ahead and looking back, they are extremely worried. Not only is the path to serving society narrow, but the reputation of the alma mater for more than fifty years will also be wiped out in one day. Our association is an organization representing all the students, and it is difficult to sit idly by and watch the students' hesitation. We hope that your esteemed organization will make a concrete decision on the registration of our school and consult with the church to promote the early realization of registration. This is not only the good fortune of all alumni and students, but also the good fortune of the school and society and the country. Respectfully presented to the Board of Trustees of St. John's University, Representatives of the Student Union of St. John's University in Shanghai, the entire student body of the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Civil Engineering, the Medical School, and the Middle School Department.

Commercial News

### Grain

Flour Plummets Recently

Spot Sales are Not Smooth

There is News of Shipments from the Interior to Shanghai

Yesterday, the flour market saw a sharp drop in the near-term market. The reported prices of foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada fell by four, five, or six jiao respectively in the past two days. After the opening price, the current month's contract was not strong due to a lack of actual hedging, and most of the actual chips were held steady. As a result, the long side became exhausted and had little power to develop. This was because sales in the north were not smooth, and there was news of armored shipments before the delivery of flour from the interior. As a result, the long side was extremely uneasy. The opening price was 9.4 jiao, and then it fell by another 0.01 jiao. The opening price for April also fell by 0.04 jiao to 9.6 jiao. The market sentiment for July and August was relatively stable, with only small drops of 0.02 or 0.03 jiao. By the afternoon opening, the market atmosphere was uniformly bearish, and near-term wheat also fell sharply. The lowest price for the current month was 9.1125 jiao. Then, due to the entry of chips from small factories, and some covering of short positions, there was a slight rebound. However, insiders speculated that if sales in the north do not improve and spot goods remain abundant, the near-term market cannot be considered stable.

Reasons for the Loose Fall in Futures and Spot Wheat

The Weather is Clear... Wheat Seedlings are Developing

Foreign Wheat Rebounds Slightly... Market Sentiment is Unstable

Yesterday, the futures wheat market saw a loose and falling trend in all months at the opening. The reported rebound in foreign wheat naturally made market sentiment uneasy. As far as the near-term is concerned, flour sales are not smooth, and the outlet for wheat is naturally reduced invisibly. Factories in this city will not buy unless the price is low. Although Tianjin factories are still holding firm, they cannot resist the pressure of facts. Therefore, the opening price for March fell by 0.1 jiao, and the price for April and later months fell by 0.04 to 0.07 jiao. By the afternoon opening, the market sentiment was weak due to the sharp drop in near-term flour. The lowest price fell by 0.43 jiao. Then, there was a slight rebound due to some covering of short positions. If the weather continues to be good and the wheat seedlings thrive, market sentiment may continue to be weak. In the spot wheat market, the asking price also fell by about 0.1 jiao due to the sharp drop in the standard price. The opening price for Huaian wheat was 6.45 yuan, Shaoxing wheat was 6.4 yuan or 6.5 yuan, and Jiangbei wheat was 6.37 yuan, totaling more than 2,000 bags.

Arrivals are Many, Sales are Slow, and Early Indica Rice is Still Over-Supplied

-- Doing Open Market Rebounds Slightly by 0.05 to 0.1 Jiao --

Yesterday, the market for early indica rice saw a steady stream of arrivals. Inventories are abundant, and the market is still over-supplied. Although there have been recent discussions about the China Rice Industry Company setting up stalls in the Yangtze River production area to purchase rice, the actual sales are still pending. Rice from various sources still needs to be concentrated in the Shanghai market. Therefore, the minds of the cargo owners are still unsettled. Yesterday, the market was full of requests for sales. When the Cantonese demand decreased, the market immediately rebounded slightly by 0.05 to 0.1 jiao. The Cantonese gangs still had 5,000 to 6,000 bags of raw rice to sell, and the asking price was slightly tight. The Xi'an gangs also sold 470 bags of Hunan rice. There were also inquiries from Shantou. The market on this street was still okay. A total of 8,576 bags of Jiangxi rice, 800 bags of Taiwanese indica rice, and 4,470 bags of Hunan rice were opened for sale throughout the day.

The Outlet for Thin Rice is Still Strong

-- But the Market Still Goes Down by About a Jiao --

Yesterday, the source of goods from the various gangs in South Shanghai totaled about 11,000 to 12,000 shi, with thin rice accounting for half. Therefore, although there were more than 3,000 bags of thin rice purchased by the Qingdao and Xi'an gangs, the Hakka consumption was quite demanding, and the market went down by nearly a jiao. Sales of thick japonica rice on this street are still sluggish. Moreover, with the arrival of the goods, the price fell by 0.1 jiao. Duyang has also depreciated by about a jiao. The cloudy yuan has no honor or disgrace.

It is Not Easy for Soybeans to Fall When Arrivals are Scarce

Yesterday, the soybean market showed a gyrating situation, because the oil mills in this city waited and watched as the Lian City fell. However, the source of goods was not abundant, and the psychology of the cargo owners was quite firm. The market atmosphere was not easy to fall. The behavior Xiao Shichang saw ups and downs depending on the concentration of the Xiao Shichang. It is estimated that the Fuzhou and Guang gangs in Hankou initially bought more than 4,000 bags of Zhado, and the market saw 45 points, and only 335 bags of late beans were traded, and the market was slightly repaired for 23 points. There were other transactions of Doudoushahuang for more than 500 bags, more than 100 bags of Huaiqiudou, more than 220 bags of Dingjiazhou beans, more than 300 full bags of Linhuaguan beans, and the market price was not very different.

### Yarn and Cloth

Spot Yarn Lacks Vigor

The yarn market fell in the morning but recovered in the afternoon. The overall trend remained peaceful, but market sentiment largely anticipated further declines. Despite peak season for yarn sales, activity from various guilds was weak, leading to increased selling pressure. This resulted in a stagnant and weak market. Furthermore, the sluggishness of the northern yarn and cloth market dampened confidence. However, overseas cotton conditions remained firm, prompting some to adopt a buy-on-dips strategy. The future direction will depend on actual demand.

Marked Yarn Drops by About One Yuan

The marked yarn market opened lower across all months, but contracts for the distant months remained firm and stable. The second session opened with news from Osaka that Three Bells Yarn had risen by 1.6 to 2 yuan, boosting confidence. All months rose by 0.7 to 0.8 yuan. However, by the third session, it was reported that spot yarn business was unusually quiet, with only 200 bales changing hands. A wave of selling then began, further accelerating the decline. Marked yarn prices closed down 0.7 to 1.12 yuan from the previous day's close across all months. In the afternoon session, nearby months appeared weak due to sluggish yarn sales, while distant months remained elevated. After the second session, the market remained flat. By the third session, profit-takers covered their positions, pushing prices up a few jiao (tenths of a yuan). The closing price was up 0.2 to 0.3 yuan from the morning close across all months, except for the current month, which remained unchanged. Sales included 1,300 bales from Hengyi, 1,900 bales from Dafeng, 950 bales from Renfeng, 650 bales from Mingde, 700 bales from Taichang, 900 bales from Yichang, 3,350 bales from Changfeng, 1,250 bales from Xiecheng, 1,200 bales from Jinchang, 1,000 bales from Hexing, 1,000 bales from Dachangcheng, and 800 bales from Xinhua. Purchases included 1,000 bales from Dafu, 750 bales from Jifeng, 1,300 bales from Yuda, 2,100 bales from Dachang, 1,200 bales from Shenji, 800 bales from Fukang, 2,200 bales from Xincheng, and 950 bales from Runkang. A comparison of the market's movements throughout the day is shown below.

Spot Yarn Sales Weak

A total of 423 bales were purchased by various guilds throughout the day. Prices fell 0.5 to 1 yuan. Purchase amounts by each guild are as follows:

Cotton Market Lacks Excitement

The cotton market continued to decline as the rally in American cotton had stalled and the yarn market had retreated, leading to an even sharper decline in cotton prices. Furthermore, large inventories in Shanghai and a lack of significant demand prevented robust external cotton prices from sparking enthusiasm. In the afternoon, some shorts covered their positions, leading to a slight recovery.

Futures Cotton Follows Overseas Cotton

The marked cotton market opened unchanged across all months due to mixed news from the US cotton market, which saw fluctuations of 2 to 7 points, a sharp drop in Indian cotton by 2.75 to 3 rupees, and a recovery in Osaka's Three Bells Cotton by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. Market sentiment was still positive. The second session saw a slight rise. However, by the third session, the market declined along with the sluggish yarn market, with distant months breaking through 45 yuan per dan (unit of weight).

Weak Sales of Yarn and Cotton in Tianjin

Lack of Follow-Through Buyers for New US Cotton

Merchants Still Buying Old Cotton

The market recovered with merchants buying nearby months and Wall Street and foreign merchants buying new cotton. However, follow-through buying was lacking and prices fell again. 20 March delivery notices have been accepted, further widening the March spread. Hester estimated mill consumption for the week at 289,000 bales and Liverpool stocks at 391,000 bales. Merchants bought old cotton before the close, pushing prices higher again. The close was stable, with spot prices up 2 points and futures up 2 points to down 6 points. English spot cotton was down 3 points and futures were down 5 to 7 points.

### Silk and Tea

Keemun and Ningchow Scented Tea Sales to England are Sluggish

—Affected by Ceylon and Java Teas—

Keemun and Ningchow scented black teas had strong demand from England, Russia, and other regions last year. When new tea arrived in Shanghai, market prices rose to around 40 yuan, and the market was very good. Currently, the English market is seeing a surge in the quantity of teas from Ceylon and Java, which has significantly impacted Keemun and Ningchow scented teas from China. Foreign tea is cheaper while Chinese tea is more expensive, and most tea merchants dealing in these scented teas have suffered losses. Recently, market prices have gradually fallen to 23-24 yuan, but sales remain sluggish. According to general merchant observations, the opening prices for Keemun and Ningchow scented teas this year will be lower than in previous years.

### Compilation Method of Income Tax Return Forms (9)

— Pan Shihao

(4) Report Form (with checklist) for Deduction of Salaries and Remuneration Income of the Second Category (Continued)

(3) Category of Income: According to the provisions of Article 16 of the Implementing Regulations, all salaries, pensions, remuneration, etc. received from occupations and work are income of this category and should be filled in separately. According to the instructions in item 2 of the checklist, the taxpayer should fill in the name of all monthly, annual, irregular, or piece-rate income during the taxation period. The Income Category column should, according to the facts, record the names of the salaries and remuneration received by the taxpayer in detail. For example, monthly salary, annual salary, piecework wages, and temporary allowances. If a taxpayer has several types of salary and remuneration income, they should be recorded separately.

(4) Period of Service: According to the provisions of Article 16 of the Implementing Regulations, the period of service for the occupation and work that generated the salary and remuneration should be recorded. For example, January, February, or March of the 16th year. If salaries and remuneration for several months are paid in a lump sum, they should be recorded separately for each month. This allows the income tax payable to be standardized using the monthly average. In Article 5 of the Provisional Conditions for Income Tax, the regulations for tax rates specifically mention "monthly average income," indicating that the payment of salaries and remuneration, whether paid several times a month or once every few months, should be listed in this checklist on a monthly basis. Article 7 of the Provisional Regulations states that the income of the first category, whether calculated monthly or annually, should be taxed on a monthly average. The period of service should be calculated on a monthly basis to calculate the average income, which is the natural interpretation. According to recent statements from the Shanghai Income Tax Office, businesses can estimate the number of employees and salaries for the year, deduct taxes once, and make supplementary reports at the end of the year if there are any changes. According to this interpretation, employee salaries can be reported on an annual basis and the monthly average can be calculated for a one-time prepayment. Here, we should also consider the question of when to deduct income tax if the fixed amount of salary and remuneration is calculated annually but not paid on a monthly average. The Provisional Regulations for Income Tax stipulate that taxes on income from securities and deposits of the third category must be reported and paid within one month after payment or receipt. Taxes on income from profit-making enterprises of the first category must be reported and paid within three months after settlement for categories A and B, and within one month after settlement for category C. However, for income tax of the second category, apart from the phrase "paid on a monthly basis" in Article 26 of the Implementing Regulations, the Provisional Regulations only stipulate that reports must be submitted within the tax payment period, without specifying the meaning of the tax payment period. By drawing analogies from the explicit terms "payment," "receipt," and "settlement" for income tax of the first and third categories, the reporting and payment of income tax of the second category should be done at the time of payment of salaries and remuneration. Furthermore, both the second and third categories of income tax are source-based taxes and are based on the principle of applying the withholding system. Withholding means deducting the income tax payable at the time of payment and paying it on behalf of the taxpayer. Therefore, annual salaries that have not been paid can be withheld and paid together at the end of the year or settlement, without the need to first average the income earned monthly and deduct it in installments. Therefore, Article 14 of the Instructions for Taxpayers of this category states that for salary and remuneration income calculated on an annual basis, the total annual income should be divided by the number of months in a year, and the resulting amount is the monthly average. One...twelve months should be taxed a total of 7.1 yuan, which should be withheld and paid together at the time of payment. According to Article 15 of the same Instructions, income calculated on a quarterly or semi-annual basis can also be withheld and paid together at the time of payment. The phrase "paid together" should be noted. However, if this type of periodic income is due for settlement and payment before the year-end settlement, and a portion is paid in advance, the amount paid each month, whether in the form of salary or temporary loan, should be calculated and taxed according to the monthly amount paid. At the time of the final settlement, the tax payable for the entire period should be calculated together for supplementary tax reporting and payment. Article 13 of the Instructions for this category states that if government agencies or employers fail to pay full salaries, taxes should be calculated and taxed according to the following regulations:

(1) If salaries are discounted, taxes should first be calculated and taxed based on the actual amount paid. When supplementary payments are made, supplementary taxes should be reported and paid.

(2) If borrowing is used as a substitute for salary payment, the actual amount borrowed each month should be used to calculate and pay the supplementary tax in accordance with the calculation method of the previous clause.

It can be seen that income from salaries and remuneration calculated on a monthly basis should be reported on a monthly basis, and income calculated on a quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis should also be reported on a monthly basis, as some payments will inevitably be made on a monthly basis. However, the taxes withheld in this way are different from monthly salaries in terms of the period of service. Therefore, they must be clearly stated in the Income Category and Period of Service columns. For the convenience of reporting and payment procedures, it is best to pay taxes on this type of periodic income that is not calculated monthly by averaging the income amount to be paid into the salary and remuneration account on a monthly basis. Then, regardless of whether the income is actually paid in full on a monthly basis, the income tax has been paid off. This is more convenient both internally and externally. However, discounted salary payments should be treated separately. Item 4 of the Notes in this checklist explains that the Period of Service column should be filled in with the total number of days or months during which income from annual, irregular, or piece-rate systems was earned. However, the withholding of income tax for the second category should be calculated based on the monthly average income, so the total income for several months should be averaged monthly and recorded separately. The total number of days of income exceeding one month should also be calculated monthly. The explanation of these notes should be applied flexibly. (To be continued)

Children's Special Edition

### Clever People and Stupid People

— Wanwen

Clever people and stupid people, we can see them anytime, anywhere. However, children spend more time at school, so they know more about them. There are certainly clever and stupid people among our classmates, but unfortunately, not many clever people can use their cleverness. They are often arrogant, and their grades are worse than those who are diligent but considered stupid. On the other hand, stupid people often feel discouraged because they think they are stupid, and their grades are even worse.

Success requires perseverance, the ability to endure hardship, and a willingness to think. Judging the success or failure of things based on cleverness or stupidity is unreliable. Who can say that every inventor is a highly intelligent person? Their success is due to perseverance, the ability to endure hardship, and a willingness to think.

Stupid people always blame heaven and others for being born so stupid. They don't work hard and don't think, so they don't know how to improve. Clever people think they know everything and often use their petty cleverness to cheat and deceive others. They never realize that they are using their cleverness inappropriately. Both of these types of people are now harmful and useless to schools and society.

The only way to make stupid people not stupid is to think more. The more they think, the more developed they will become. For example, it is said that ancient people used to have tails, but they degenerated and disappeared because they were not used. If the brain is not used, it will also become dull and degenerate. Can people who don't think still be considered human? Clever people are lucky to have cleverness, so they should use it to do beneficial work, not to do evil and increase suffering for others.

Finally, I repeat to the children: Clever people should not be arrogant, arrogance is the mother of failure. Stupid people should not be discouraged. As long as you are willing to think and work hard, there is nothing you cannot succeed in.

### Min-er's 'Movie'

— Ai Mei

Min-er is already a twelve-year-old child, and compared to his seven-year-old younger brother,—Jie-er, and six-year-old younger sister,—Zhu-er, he knows how to study much more diligently; not only does he not dare to slack off at school, but even on Sundays and other holidays, he is busy revising his lessons all day long at home: only after he finishes his work is he willing to play with his younger siblings for a while. Therefore, sometimes his younger siblings, seeing that their older brother is unwilling to play with them, feel lonely, and inevitably pester him, disturbing him. Fortunately, Dad and Mom always come to his rescue, coaxing and scaring them away.

Today, it's Sunday again, and coincidentally, Dad has been invited to a banquet by a friend and hasn't returned; Mom has caught a bit of a cold and is lying in bed taking a nap; Jie-er and Zhu-er, for some reason, got annoyed with each other and started crying. Min-er, afraid that they would wake up Mom, had no choice but to put down his homework and coax them: 'Stop crying! Be careful you wake up Mom and she'll come and hit you! ┆ Whoever stops crying first, I'll take to see a movie.' These few words really stopped the two children from crying.

Min-er returned to his study and picked up his pen to 'do arithmetic'; before long, Jie-er and Zhu-er, already holding hands, came in smiling and pestered him to take them to see a movie right away. However, Min-er still had several answers to complete, so how could he be willing to take them? But, he was afraid of making them cry again. Clever Min-er thought for a moment and came up with an idea. He coaxed them again: 'Going to the cinema now, the first showing is too late, the second showing is still early; how about this! Let me first make the movie I invented for you to watch, I guarantee you'll find it interesting! Then we'll go to the cinema in the evening, okay?'

Clever Min-er took out several square pieces of white paper to make a screen, and also found many scraps of paper, and used scissors to cut them into many people and objects, and busily used paste to glue them separately onto each paper screen: in just five minutes, he had already made several scenes. Then he used his left hand to hold a scene, and his right hand to strike a match, waving it behind the screen, and the characters on the screen moved. He performed scene after scene, and all that could be heard from his mouth was him calling out each scene: 'Jump!... Solo dance,... Duo dance;... This is Japan attacking the Northeast;... This is the 19th Route Army fighting the enemy in Shanghai;... This is fighting the enemy in Suiyuan;... These are the trained recruits;... These are the planes practicing air defense;... This is...' Jie-er and Zhu-er were so happy watching that they clapped their hands and laughed. After the performance, they snatched each scene away and went to play with it themselves. Min-er, after spending less than ten minutes of effort, was able to quietly do his homework again.

Little friends! Can you guess: how did Min-er's movie move? To put it simply, the paper-cut people and objects glued on the paper screen were only glued at the top and bottom edges, with the middle hanging in the air: therefore, using the light of the match, the shadows were pushed into motion. Little friends! In your spare time after class, why not imitate it and play around?

### I Love the Goodness of Spring

— Lu Er Yu

I love the goodness of spring,
Spring is the most beautiful,
Red flowers,
Green grass,
Yellow orioles on the treetops chirping.

I love the goodness of spring,
Spring is the most lively,
Paper kites fill the sky,
Almost turning the Heavenly Palace upside down;
I love the goodness of spring,
Spring gets up early,
Hurrying to the countryside,
Practicing a set of fitness exercises.

I love the goodness of spring,
I wish the goodness of spring would never age,
However, time once gone never returns,
Seize the moment to strive and become heroes.

### Shrimp

— Zhong Mei

On Sunday, Little Min bought a glass tank in a glass shop. He was preparing to raise goldfish in this glass tank after returning home. After returning home, he found a cloth net in the flower room and ran to the small pond in the garden to catch goldfish, but after catching for a long time, he didn't catch a single goldfish. So Little Min used his strength to catch two goldfish, and around the goldfish, there were many small shrimp. He first put the goldfish in the newly bought glass tank, then put the shrimp in another small bottle, and took it in to ask his older brother: 'What is the structure of a shrimp's body?'

'Their body structure is composed of seven segments that combine to form the abdomen, the thorax, and the head, which merge to form the cephalothorax, because it is covered by a carapace on the outside, so it is called the cephalothorax. These points are different from insects. Their abdomen can freely extend and contract, and the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth segments have a pair of swimming legs. The pair of swimming legs on the sixth segment extend backward and merge with the seventh segment to form the tail fin. They have five pairs of walking legs that can move in the water. In the cephalothorax, there is a pair of compound eyes, two pairs of antennae, and the mouth is below:'

'Their internal structure has five kinds of organs: One, respiratory organs, on the left and right sides of the cephalothorax, there are several pairs of gills shaped like feathers. Two, digestive organs: the mouth has two pairs of mandibles, one pair of maxillae, and three pairs of maxillipeds, all connected to the lower esophagus, stomach, and intestines, and there are two livers. Three, nervous system and circulatory system: the nervous system has ganglia in each of the seven segments, so the nerves are distributed throughout the body. Circulatory system: the main organs are the heart and blood vessels, all on the dorsal side of the digestive organs. Four, excretory organs: the main organs have a type called the antennal gland, which is used for excretion. Five, reproductive system: male shrimp have ovaries, and female shrimp have testes. The eggs are very large, and after laying, they must undergo several metamorphoses to become shrimp.'

'So what is the use of shrimp?'

'The uses of shrimp: in their larval stage, they can be food for fish, so they are beneficial to the aquaculture industry. The meat and eggs of shrimp are very delicious and can be eaten.'

### Bottle and Water Game

— Hu Chu Yu

These are several interesting science experiment tricks that can be performed with empty bottles.

A. Various sounds can be produced from the mouth of the bottle. Use an empty bottle (a beer bottle can be used), pour in a small amount of water, hold the lips against the mouth of the bottle, and blow it gently. A thin sound can be heard, like the sound of a ship leaving the port. If you blow harder, the sound will also become higher. If you pour one-third of water into the bottle and blow it, then the sound will become even higher. This is because the amount of water affects the different pitches of the sounds produced. What is the reason for this? Because the air in the bottle is vibrated by the blowing of the lips, and the vibration of the air will produce sound. The air at the mouth of the bottle vibrates first, so the air in the bottle also shakes. This is the same principle as blowing a flute. The air blown into the flute vibrates the air in the tube, and adjusting the fingers produces a very pleasant melody.

B. Water is sprayed from the bottle. Still use a soda bottle, fill half of it with water, and also prepare a pen tube or a drinking straw, or a glass tube. Use a bottle stopper, and make a small hole in the middle of the bottle stopper, the size suitable for inserting the pen tube or straw, but not too loose. Then insert the pen tube and blow forcefully into it with your mouth. When the mouth leaves the bottle, water will spray out from the tube. What is the reason for this? It is because the air blown in from the tube fills the bottle, and the air pressure is very strong. The gas expands and presses against the water surface, and the water is forced out from the tube. This is the same principle as the air brakes on a streetcar.

### New War Weapon—Flying Tank

— Dong Xun

The terror of '1936' has just passed, and a new terror is coming! The world's major powers are preparing their new war weapons, preparing for a massacre in the near future! Even our China is also preparing—although our country does not hope to invade others or massacre others, a proper defense is a strategy we should have.

In this upcoming world war, countries will use their new weapons, such as death rays, flamethrower tanks, giant bombers, radio weapons... and so on. The extent of the destruction that living beings will suffer in the future is unknown!

The United States recently announced the invention of a new war weapon—the flying tank. The appearance of this terrible tank has broken all previous fantasies, proving that it is a possible thing. Although we have seen discoveries of flying tanks, tank aircraft, and other things in military science pictorials before, that was just an invention that had not been fully successful. However, the appearance of the American flying tank this time is a genuine and beautiful invention!

This flying tank was invented by Walter J. Christic of New York, USA. He was originally the inventor of the 'Variable Rate Tank' (pictured at the bottom). Later, he suspended the tank he invented under the frame of an airplane. (as pictured at the top) and carried it in flight. When they fly to the location they want to land—like the rear defenses of the enemy army, the pilot on the plane presses a button, allowing the tank to separate from it, and then presses another button to extend the two wheels underneath. After the tank lands, it can use its own power to attack the enemy: as for its speed: when crawling, it is 65 miles per hour, and when using wheels, it can reach 90 miles per hour!

This invention can be said to be a great contribution to the war, but its disadvantage is that: 'It can only put the tank on the ground, but cannot lift the tank into the air, which is just like the Soviet Union's invention of aviation infantry's 'can only jump from the plane with a parachute, but the plane cannot take them from the ground onto the plane' similarly has the same disadvantage! Fortunately, during the war, they all went with the determination to win or die, and they did not hope to return to the air, so this disadvantage can be temporarily maintained!

### Mother

— (Chen Tian Ci)

It must be remembered that in one's life, one is bound to taste all kinds of hardships, and the most bitter of these is the loss of a loving mother.

It must also be known that the love between parent and child is the most sacred thing among all the emotions in the world. The person who destroys this emotion is the most unfortunate person in the world.

Even if a person has committed the crime of murder, as long as he respects and loves his mother, there are still beautiful and noble parts left in his heart. No matter how famous a person is, if he makes his mother cry and makes his mother suffer, then he is truly a despicable and contemptible person.

One should not say impolite words to one's own mother. If one is careless and says the wrong thing, one should repent from the heart, throw oneself at one's mother's knees, and ask for a kiss of forgiveness to wipe away the stain of filial impiety on one's forehead. (Quotations from the Education of Love)

### Bear and Lion

— Jiang Gang

A very large bear was walking on the grass at the foot of a mountain. It happened to see a zebra grazing there. So it ran over and said to the zebra very proudly: 'Other animals kneel down immediately when they see me, because I am the most beautiful and most powerful; but why don't you kneel down when you see me?' The zebra replied: 'Bah! You bad seed, born with such an ugly face and body, who admits that you are the most beautiful and most powerful. To tell you the truth, the lion living in that cave in the mountain, it can be regarded as the most beautiful and most powerful animal, you stupid thing, how can you compare to it.' The bear was aroused to great anger by these words, and pounced straight at the zebra. The zebra cleverly raised its hind feet and kicked the bear fiercely in the face, and ran forward without turning its head.

The bear failed to catch the zebra and was kicked by the zebra instead, which added to its anger. It desperately chased after the zebra. The zebra ran very fast, how could the bear catch it. In a moment, the zebra disappeared, and only the lion that the zebra had told it about was standing at the entrance of the cave on the other side. The bear, unable to catch the zebra, abandoned the zebra and went to reason with the lion? It still said to the lion very proudly: 'Other animals say you are the most beautiful and most powerful, is that true?' The lion replied: 'No, I really feel that my body is too weak and too ugly! How beautifully and strongly you are born. Now my weak body is prepared for you to eat; please eat me quickly!' The bear listened, laughed out loud. Just as it was about to pounce on the lion to eat it, it was unexpectedly pinned down by the lion. At this time, the bear, which claimed to be the strongest, could not move at all, and the lion tore it to pieces and ate even the bones and skin.

### A Comfortable Nest in a Big Storm

——Answer to Wang Zhishou of Zhixing Elementary School in Changsha

Brother Zhishou:

We should congratulate you, because when you tried camping for the first time, you encountered the heavy rain and strong wind that God gave you! That's a good opportunity to increase your camping experience and knowledge!

It is certainly your negligence that your tents were blown away by the wind and the curtains were soaked with water, but since you are not experienced campers, it is reasonable that the leader does not blame you and even encourages you. In fact, as long as experience and knowledge increase, strong winds and heavy rain are no different from the gentle sun and charming spring in the eyes of a Boy Scout!

Camping knowledge, such as digging trenches, hammering tent pegs, etc., is related to the equipment for defending against wind and rain, but you will learn these in the intermediate course! I am going to tell you here about a tent design that is not only convenient for normal times, but also has the effect of resisting wind and rain.

If you look at the image here, you can understand its structure. Then please try to build one according to it! After it is set up, you only need to add some straw under the canvas, and hang a piece of canvas on the crossbeam, tie it with ropes and spread it out to both sides, and nail it on both sides. This is a success! Finally, secure the four foot roots more firmly, so that no matter how damp the ground is or how strong the wind is blowing, you will not be greatly affected!

We believe that anyone can build such a tent. If our camping location is in a forest area, then we only need to bring two pieces of canvas and some ropes!

Goodbye, I wish you success!

Sincerely, China Boy Scouts Self-Help Society.

### Arctic Explorer (1)

— Xi

In the Arctic waters, there are water and sky and snow seas everywhere, and many of the bravest and most persevering deeds of explorers often happen there. Since the accession of King Edward VI of England, Sir Hugh Willoughby and his sailors all froze to death among the rocks of Spitsbergen in search of adventure. This barren and desolate area, filled with hard and cruel water and soft and merciless snow, has become the tomb of countless warriors. Many lives have been sacrificed in order to explore a northwest passage between the Davis and Bering Straits and to survey the outline of the north coast of America. In 1845, Sir John Franklin sailed on two trial ships, the 'Erebus' and the 'Terror', for a second Arctic expedition, but after this departure, no one ever saw them again, nor did they receive any news from them. So someone organized search parties to search for them. This heroic act is truly praiseworthy and moving.

Ship after ship sailed out, initially hoping to rescue the crew of the two missing ships. Later, they gave up hope, only wanting to know their whereabouts, but nothing worked. Seeing that sending teams of people out was a futile risk, the Admiralty stopped sending them to avoid unnecessarily sacrificing valuable lives. However, Sir Franklin's wife and several brave explorers still searched relentlessly until, fourteen years later, Leopold McClintock found the final record in the 'Fox' yacht, proving that Sir Franklin had passed away peacefully long before his expedition encountered disaster. As for the sailors, they were trapped between prison-like ice mountains, cut off from their return route, and gradually froze and starved to death.

Among those calm and determined warriors of the search team, there are two warriors who deserve special mention, because they were not British and had no compatriotic relationship with Sir Franklin, but volunteered to risk their lives to do this search work. One was French Naval Lieutenant Bellot, who set out on the 'Albatros' in 1851, endured all kinds of hardships, and still moved forward unyieldingly, earning the love of his subordinates, but unfortunately drowned in Wellington Strait when encountering ice floes. The other was American Naval Surgeon Dr. Elisha Kane, who in 1853 led an American search party to search for the two missing ships, believing that they were trapped in a relatively clear and warm basin, which might exist in the Arctic. Often, due to the movement of the ice mountains, this basin sometimes opens and sometimes closes, and the Franklins may have been locked there by the ice mountains.

Talking Points

### Bookworm's Doctor of Literature

— Wo

The term 'bookworm' seems to have originated only in our country, and has never been heard of in other countries, like a store's signboard, only this one branch, no other branches. Unexpectedly, Mikami Sanji, a Japanese man with a Doctor of Literature degree and a member of the House of Peers, and the bookworms in our country's old novels, have the same demeanor.

A so-called bookworm does not have a fixed style, and there is no fixed standard for the degree of his foolishness. Generally speaking, such a person is unaware of current affairs, ignorant of the ways of the world, disheveled, nitpicking, constantly using archaic language, and every speech is outside the realm of ordinary ideals, making people laugh, even making people burst into laughter, and this is called a bookworm.

The other day, at a meeting of the Japanese House of Peers, Mikami Sanji, an elderly Doctor of Literature, suddenly questioned Foreign Minister Sato Naotake, asking why the Japanese government recognized the customary name of the Republic of China. Mikami explained that the habitual use of the two characters 'Zhonghua' (中華) indicated contempt for countries other than China. This kind of question is truly absurd. Sato replied that in official documents, China should be called the Republic of China, and the name of each country is freely chosen by the country. Sato's answer was very honest and very appropriate, but it did not dispel the erroneous ideals in the bookworm's mind. So he also said that the Chinese people are too self-respecting and cannot be treated equally, etc. His foolish appearance is still complete.

Now I might as well ask Dr. Mikami Sanji of Literature again, the habitual use of the two characters 'Zhonghua' (中華) indicates contempt for countries other than China, that is not bad. First, I would like to ask, what is the meaning of Japan being called Japan? The so-called Japan is the origin of the sun. However, the Earth is also a planet. One rotation of the Earth is called one day, and one revolution of the Earth around the sun is called one year. The distance between the Earth and the sun is truly incomparable, and Japan only occupies a small corner of the Earth, and says Japan, its contempt for the Earth and the sun is very great. Assuming that Foreign Minister Sato refuted him with this language, how would Dr. Mikami answer?

I will further ask, the Chinese people are too self-respecting and cannot be treated equally, etc., but the self-respect of the two characters 'Zhonghua' (中華), according to the usual explanation, China is the center of Huaxia (華夏), and other countries are Huaxia (華夏) but not the center, but since they are both Huaxia (華夏), why can't they be treated equally? If Japan is called Japan, it is truly unattainable and far beyond reach. No country on Earth can be treated equally with it. It's truly a strange story, unheard of in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad.

There are several handsome and outstanding talents in the Japanese parliament, and their words and thoughts are admired by the world. Unexpectedly, today I heard Mikami Sanji's high opinion again, which is beyond people's expectations. And Mikami Sanji is also a member of the House of Peers, his position and knowledge must be superior, but his arguments are so extremely absurd. Is it his old age? Is it his foolishness? What shall I call him? I call him a bookworm.

### What If You Suddenly Became Rich

— Zhuo Ren

The tenth of this month's "Spring and Autumn" section of this newspaper carried an article stating that the New York "Little World" magazine recently published a question: "What would you do if you suddenly became rich?" and sought answers. According to the editor, they received over 2,500 responses. The magazine only selected and published over 200 of the best ones.

And only eighteen translated entries were published in "Spring and Autumn," probably also "selected" by the translator. This is certainly regrettable, as we cannot fully see the property distribution methods envisioned by those 2,500 people. I remember when aviation lottery tickets were first issued, a certain newspaper also solicited entries for "If I won the aviation lottery..." But after thirty-one draws of the aviation lottery, we didn't see a single answer. Now, let's take a look at what those eighteen foreign gentlemen and ladies would do "if they became rich."

Among them, one was a drunkard who wanted to "soak in a wine barrel all day long," and another a gambler who wanted to "play mahjong all day and night." One neurotic patient wanted to taste death, and health enthusiasts wanted to "eat tiger brains every day" and "study the art of immortality." There were also twelve entries concerning marriage and love, such as "I will live in a polygamous society," "I will tell my husband directly and frankly that I don't love him anymore," "I will marry the most beautiful woman in America"... If we scale this up proportionally to the total number of 2,500 respondents, the number is truly astonishing!

The United States is a country where everything is free except for alcohol, especially when it comes to love, and it is definitely not bound by "parents' orders and matchmakers' words." The movies they make are all "love textbooks," as someone once said. In fact, this is not necessarily an exaggeration. Young men and women who "fall in love at first sight" in a bar ten minutes ago are already being asked by a priest twenty minutes later, "Do you love your husband?" "Do you love your wife?" and holding a wedding ceremony.

So, why do more than half—twelve out of eighteen, or over 1,660 out of 2,500—of these couples want to "live in a polygamous society" or "tell my husband directly and frankly that I don't love him anymore" after "suddenly becoming rich"? Is it because they have discovered mistakes they didn't see before marriage? If so, this reason is reasonable, and every married couple has such discoveries. But what does this have to do with "suddenly becoming rich"? The United States is also a country where it is easy to get married and easy to get divorced. Why do these respondents have to wait until "suddenly becoming rich" to reveal their desires? I have no other reason to explain it, but Balzac has already dissected this issue for us: he said, "There are only two kinds of women in the world, one you want but can't have, and one you already have but don't want." Naturally, the same is true for men: one you want but can't have, and one you already have but don't want.

Therefore, even if the answer to "If I won the aviation lottery..." is revealed one day, it won't be any different from those foreign gentlemen and ladies, even though China is known as the "Land of Propriety."

### A Young Woman's Resentment

— Especially

—Northern Journey Notes—

Like two patches of floating clouds smeared across the evening sky at sunset, at night, the "warmth in terror" discovered through the window cracks still rippled in my mind, while the element of terror remained undiminished. But in summer, the days are exceptionally short. Before you know it, the gray crane's wings stir up the fish-belly white of the east. Thus, we skillfully rose in accordance with the saying, "Look at the sky at the rooster's crow."

The landlady prepared the washing water for us as usual, as if she had forgotten about last night. I can't say that, because at that time, in the deep quiet of the night, how could she know that this secret had been obtained by others?

Afterwards, we young fellows always smiled at her. Needless to say, the smile may have revealed an unnatural expression. Her full, young woman's body powerfully attacked our eyes, and an indescribable unnatural feeling arose in our hearts. At this point, she turned her face away, and we responded by singing—

—The moon is dark, the stars are high,
Zhang Fei wants a spear, oh!
What are you afraid of? Who knows when you're asleep?
No, my heart is beating, but it's hard to bear!

A stomp in the back courtyard, hey,
Green hats are hanging with oil, hey...

We laughed, clapping our hands. She glared at us, humiliated and angry, and gave us a look, so clever that we could understand what it implied. With a turn, Ah Huang disappeared. Rushing to the back courtyard, we saw the landlady and him whispering something. But when we rushed in, they scattered in a panic.

Grabbing Ah Huang, we questioned him carefully. He said, "She hopes we can stay here for another day or two. She has a way to relieve the loneliness of our journey." As he said this, a triumphant smile could not help but surface. "She also asked us how old a woman we needed and could find one to our liking." Then, a trace of greed and lust shone in his eyes. Finally, he added, "If we can't find a suitable match, she can unconditionally satisfy our needs."

Judging from the situation, Ah Huang was clearly prepared to stay here for another day or two. He was blinded by the guise of "unconditional needs." "Desire" was a burning fire consuming his chest. Who could assume a moralistic face and isolate that natural indulgence?

Originally, "rushing on the road" was just a pretentious term. If we wanted to stay somewhere for two days, we would never be restricted by anyone. In our group, the power of choice rested in Ah Huang's hands. However, we seemed to have some uneasiness pressing down that we couldn't shake. The hero with the head wrapped reappeared in our minds. Thus, we warned him—

—You must be careful! What kind of place is this? A honey trap could cost us all our material possessions, even our lives!

Naturally, these words were a big blow to him. A gust of cold wind scattered his thoughts.

Seeing that the fellows had not yet finished packing, taking advantage of the early morning清空, we invited the landlady to accompany us on a walk around the bridge and small hall that we had considered "dangerous" last night. During the walk, she told us many things about her own heart. Raising our faces, the sun had already peeked out from the waist of the mountain, and the fog had completely dissipated. In the distance, we could hear the cook shouting loudly again. Lingering? That was impossible.

Walking back to the shop, her face was somber, as if she had unspeakable secrets. After a long time, she told us a piece of good news: "You'd better rest at Erlang Bridge today. They're having a festival there, once a year. It's very rare." After saying that, she disappeared. Ah, marital dissatisfaction gave her angry flames, but in an old village, how could she burn away the layers of entanglement with the torch of a lone army!

Climbing to the top of the hill, we cast a glance at the village, a patch of gray. The landlady was buried under the thick gloom. All day long, she dealt with the 土头土脑 merchants, and the flame was exchanged for lonely resentment!

### Famous Orchestra Accompanies Performances of "The Thunderstorm" and "Lust Devil"

Harvard Professor's Criticism

Ouyang Yuqian Personally Takes the Stage

The world-famous plays "The Thunderstorm" and "Lust Devil," performed by amateur actors, have been revived at the Carlton Theatre starting on the 10th night for a period of seven days.

To meet the audience's demands and improve the technical level of the performance, the amateurs have specially invited a Western orchestra to participate in the accompaniment for this revival, led by composer Xian Xinghai.

This performance is arranged according to the needs and progression of the entire play.

According to the play "The Thunderstorm," the many poetic scenes, the moonlit night on the banks of the Wolf River, and the lovers' rendezvous on the hillside have won applause from hundreds of thousands of viewers in Beijing and Shanghai. Now, with the addition of musical accompaniment, it will undoubtedly achieve extraordinary results. During the preliminary rehearsal the other day, directors Zhang Min, Shen Xiling, and Ouyang Yuqian all praised it endlessly.

Using musical accompaniment for stage plays is still an innovation in the Chinese theater world.

The night before last, when the first scene of "Lust Devil" was performed, translator Yao Ke accompanied Harvard University drama professor Dean to visit. After the performance, Dean said: "I used to think that Chinese stage plays must be of a very low standard, but the reality is completely different. The achievements of the actors are only so-so in America. He was particularly complimentary of the lighting installation. Finally, he offered some advice to stage supervisor Ying Yunwei.

Dean then visited backstage, asked to meet the actors of the play, and warmly shook hands with Wei Heling and Ying Yin, praising them endlessly.

### Free Soul

— Nanjing Reflected

Among the orchestras participating was a Russian musician from Moscow. After watching the first scene of "Lust Devil," he said that he had seen twenty performances of "The Power of Darkness" in Moscow, but this time it could be said to be the most satisfactory.

The role of Zhang Yufu in "Lust Devil" is now personally performed by director Ouyang Yuqian, who is also known for his performance of "Pan Jinlian." Now, from a dan to a laosheng, the results are equally amazing.

### Cai Chusheng Visits Boat People

The characters in Cai Chusheng's new work "Wang Laowu" are all people we are most familiar with, but who are most neglected by the upper class.

Along the Shanghai Dapu Bridge area, along the banks of the polluted river, small bamboo boats are everywhere stranded on the beach. In these dilapidated and narrow boats, each one houses a family. They live strongly amidst contempt and insult, and their lives are often more meaningful than those of the "upper-class Chinese" in skyscrapers. The heroine of "Wang Laowu," Lan Ping, is a girl from this "boat family."

Before starting to write "Wang Laowu," Cai Chusheng had someone introduce him to visit and investigate these boats countless times, drilling in and out of the dirty and dilapidated small boats. The worthiness of this script is beyond words.
