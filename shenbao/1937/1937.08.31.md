### After Fierce Battle at Luodian, Our Troops Complete Grand Encirclement

Enemy Ships Concentrated at Liuhe; General Attack Expected This Morning – We Are Fully Prepared and Resolved to Meet Them Head-On with a Painful Blow

From yesterday afternoon until 4:00 AM this morning, the situation on the front lines is as follows: 
㊀ In the Yangshupu, Jiangwan, and Zhabei areas, our military lines remained unchanged. There was intense artillery fire between the two sides late at night. 
㊁ At Zhanghuabang, our troops continue to make progress, and the remaining enemy forces will soon be resolved. 
㊂ In the Luodian area, fierce fighting has been intense, and our troops have completed a grand encirclement, advancing rapidly towards the riverbank in separate routes, aiming to resolve the stubborn enemy in one fell swoop. 
㊃ A large number of enemy ships gathered outside Wusongkou yesterday moved towards Liuhe, intending to concentrate their forces and issue a general attack order across the entire line this morning. We have seen through their conspiracy, and the enemy will definitely not succeed. 
㊄ Enemy reinforcements continue to arrive, transported on three transport ships, and have arrived east of Chongming Island.

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) Dozens of enemy ships have moved from Wusong towards Liuhe. It is rumored that at dawn this morning, the enemy will launch a general attack on our entire line, on one hand, to cover the landing of newly arrived reinforcements, and on the other hand, to attempt to contain our forces and relieve the enemy forces surrounded near Luodian. We are fully prepared, and there is absolutely no need to worry about defenses.

A reporter from the East China News Agency returned from the front lines yesterday morning and happened to meet Cai Jinjun, the Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, who had also returned to Shanghai after visiting Commander-in-Chief Zhang from the front lines. They met at a certain location, where Cai Jinjun spoke at length about the government's determination to wage a long-term war of resistance, expressing hope that the public would trust the government and not disrupt their own ranks. He emphasized the need for good follow-up support to achieve final victory. He then discussed the battle of Luodian, expressing deep emotion about the courageous fighting of our troops. He stated that there were no enemy troops in the Wusong, Paotaiwan, Shizilin, and Liuhe areas. There were only a few enemy traces in Zhanghuabang and Yunzaobang, which could be resolved immediately. Cai Jinjun concluded by saying that the morale of our troops was high in this war of resistance, and they were all fighting the enemy with their blood and flesh, which was truly admirable. In Zhanghuabang and other places, the police brigade initially engaged with the stubborn enemy, and although they suffered more than half casualties, it was comforting to the people of the country.

### Enemy Ships' Movements Suggest Other Intentions

Enemy Main Force Plans to Move Battle to Liuhe – Izumo Flagship Hurriedly Comes and Goes

Confirmed information yesterday afternoon indicates that the enemy ships in the Wusongkou area, after repeated attacks on our Shizilin, Xiaochuansha, and Luodian, were repelled and suffered heavy damage. They have now changed their plan, and this morning, the remaining enemy troops from various locations have returned to their ships. A large number of enemy ships are moving towards Liuhe, planning to shift the main battle to that location. However, we have already seen through this conspiracy, and the enemy will definitely not succeed.

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) According to reliable reports from the Wusong area, 38 Japanese warships anchored in Wusong sailed away from Wusong yesterday, moving towards the Yangtze River estuary and the Shizilin Fort area. Their intention seems to be to gather at Shizilin and then use artillery fire to cover the landing of troops there, while simultaneously threatening our troops in Luodian and Jiading with artillery fire to cover their troops' advance. This is because the enemy has repeatedly attacked Luodian recently and been defeated. Shizilin is approximately twelve to thirteen miles from Luodian.

Regarding the enemy flagship Izumo, reports from Yangshupu indicate that at 8:00 AM yesterday morning, it was anchored in the Huangpu River outside the Zhoujiazuibang Beikou area. At 11:00 AM yesterday morning, the Izumo sailed from the Zhoujiazuibang river surface back upstream and anchored across from the Shuntai Wharf. At 1:00 PM, a Japanese transport ship came close to the Izumo, seemingly to move goods. The transport ship only left the Izumo at around 2:30 PM.

Central News Agency reports that the enemy command ship Izumo, anchored at buoy number two in the Huangpu River, suddenly sailed out of Wusongkou at 2:00 AM yesterday morning and anchored in the Shizilin sea area, leading more than 30 enemy ships anchored there, seemingly intending to cover a landing. It sailed back at noon.

The enemy ships anchored in the Huangpu River, in addition to increasing to 26 ships the day before, have decreased again yesterday. Most of the enemy ships are now concentrated in the Shizilin sea area outside Wusongkou. Even the enemy command ship Izumo once sailed to that location last night. According to an investigation by reporters yesterday morning, the anchoring situation of the ships in the Huangpu River is as follows: one gunboat on the Dinghai Road river surface, one gunboat on the Yong'an Yarn Factory river surface, one destroyer each on the Lanlu Road river surface and the Waterworks river surface, one destroyer and one gunboat each at the Pudong Xinhuishan Wharf, one destroyer each at buoys number ten and eight, one gunboat at buoy number six, and one destroyer at buoy number one. Adding the Izumo flagship, which sailed back to anchor at buoy number two at 12:00 PM yesterday, there are a total of thirteen enemy ships anchored in the Huangpu River. Along the way, reporters only saw more than 30 enemy soldiers at the Zhaoshang Beizhan and more than 20 at the Mitsubishi Wharf. Everyone else was quiet and deserted.

### Our Troops Rapidly Advance and Pressure Luodian

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) According to a report from our newspaper's war correspondent yesterday: 
㊀ After our troops recaptured Luodian Town a few days ago, the vanguard has now advanced to the coastal area. The flowing river water at Xiaochuanshakou can be clearly seen, and they will definitely reach the river mouth by nightfall. 
㊁ In the Luodian area, our troops are deploying fresh troops for a swift advance. From now on, enemy troops will definitely not be able to land there. 
㊂ There are still approximately 2,000 remaining enemy troops north of Luodian Town, constructing fortifications in an attempt to hold on. Yesterday, they confronted our troops across the river. The rivers in that area meander, with many harbors and creeks. The water is deep enough to drown someone. The enemy lines are already in disarray. 
㊄ Our troops have deployed new lines of defense along the coasts of Liuhe, Shizilin, and Wusong. No matter how stubborn the enemy is, we are well-equipped to deal with them.

Central News Agency reports that fierce fighting continued in the Luodian area yesterday morning. Our troops first circled around to Yuepu Town, east of Luodian, to form a grand encirclement. The enemy near Luodian immediately retreated, and our troops captured many enemy military supplies. Our troops are now advancing rapidly along separate routes towards the riverbank, aiming to pressure the enemy to the riverbank and resolve them there.

According to official sources from the Central News Agency, the enemy in the Luodian area has been pressured by our troops to the vicinity of the river. Yesterday, they were also attacked from both sides by troops stationed in the Yuepu area and suffered heavy losses. The enemy troops are now retreating to the Xujinggang area, where they are heavily surrounded. Only about 300 remaining enemy troops are left in the Yunzaobang area, and they are still being cleared out. As for the Zhabei area, it was relatively quiet yesterday.

Enemy Troops at Zhanghuabang Retreat to the Riverbank

After being fiercely attacked by our troops on the evening of the 28th, the enemy in the Zhanghuabang and Yunzaobang areas have been pressured to retreat to the riverbank and are completely surrounded by our troops. Yesterday, our troops launched a surprise attack, circling around to the riverbank and attacking the enemy flanks from both sides. The enemy lines have already wavered. It is reported that the enemy troops who initially landed there consisted of about one brigade, and more than half have now been killed or wounded. They are gathered near the Zhanghuabang and Yunzaobang stations, still attempting to resist stubbornly. Our troops are still on the offensive, aiming to annihilate the remaining enemy.

### Eyewitness Account Outside Wusongkou

Enemy Raiding Boats Have Simple Construction – Enemy Aircraft Carrier Anchored off Chongming Island – Wusong Town a Scorched Earth

Yesterday, a Chinese citizen returned from overseas and passed through Wusong. He reported the situation outside the harbor in great detail to reporters. The following is a record of his report. There were about thirty enemy ships outside Wusongkou. Some of the soldiers on the ships were relaxing and resting, while others were busy working, mainly transporting munitions. Small boats for carrying soldiers on stealthy landing were parked beside the large ships. These small boats had a very simple construction, with just wooden planks. They had no edges on the four sides, and had a motor underneath the plank. The sound of the motor was very quiet and the speed very fast. The raiding soldiers all lay flat on the board, which could carry forty or fifty people. A Westerner on the same boat to Shanghai said that the extremely simple construction of such raiding boats means that the construction costs are very low. Near Chongming Island, there were two enemy aircraft carriers anchored, each with about thirty to forty aircraft. The ships were piled high with munitions and food, which it is expected that local collaborators sold to them. After the small boat entered the harbor, the Wusong area was completely scorched earth. The areas west of Yangshupu were scarred and wounded, which could not but cause a sense of resentment towards the insatiable ambition of the Japanese military.

Enemy Artillery Fire in Hongkou Does No Damage

Yesterday afternoon, the enemy in the Hongkou area bombarded our Jiangwan positions with heavy artillery, aimlessly. As a result, the building next to the Racecourse General Association caught fire, but it caused no damage to our troops. Our artillery units immediately retaliated, and the area near the enemy's Hongkou headquarters was severely damaged by our bombing.

Our troops in Yangshupu previously retreated from the protruding defense lines at Dong Broadway and other places, making the defense more solid. However, even with the Japanese army adding reinforcements, they have repeatedly failed to counterattack. In recent days, we have adopted guerrilla tactics, repeatedly attacking the Yuezhou Road, Dong Xihuaide Road and Dong Broadway areas, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, giving the enemy a severe blow while making them caught off guard. The enemy troops in that area are now quite panicked, often gathering in strongholds and fortifications, afraid to launch a counterattack lightly.

Intense Artillery Fire at Jiangwan Last Night

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) Starting at 11:40 PM last night, the enemy bombarded our Jiangwan positions with heavy artillery. Our troops retaliated with heavy artillery, and for a time, the sound of artillery fire roared, with intense fighting lasting for an hour before subsiding. Our positions suffered little damage.

Central News Agency reports that the enemy on North Sichuan Road has launched several counterattacks towards our Zhabei area in recent days, but all have been repelled by our troops. As of last night, our defense lines have not changed. The North Station area has been the site of intense attacks by concentrated enemy forces for days, but it remains in our hands, with no enemy presence.

From the night before last until yesterday morning, the enemy in the Zhabei area repeatedly launched counterattacks from the Qingyun Bridge and Bazibao area, but were all bravely repelled by our troops. At around 1:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy launched an attack on the left flank of our Patriotic Girls' School position. Our troops responded calmly, using machine guns for intensive strafing. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. At the same time, our air force also flew to the skies above the enemy's positions and bombed them, causing extremely heavy damage to the enemy, who were in a terrible state.

Fires in Zhabei and Hongkou Yesterday

From 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM yesterday, two teams of enemy aircraft, a total of six, dropped bombs in the Baoshan Road area of Zhabei. A fire broke out north of the Laobazi Road and spread rapidly. Enemy aircraft circling over Pudong did not drop any bombs.

At around 1:00 PM, reports indicated that there were major fires in the Yuezhou Road, Liping Road, Hailer Road, and Tongzhou Road areas of Hongkou. At around 4:00 PM, a major fire also broke out in the Pengpu Road area.

Enemy Reinforcements Continue to Arrive and Transport Munitions

Confirmed reports indicate that enemy reinforcements continue to arrive, transported on six transport ships, which arrived east of Chongming Island yesterday and are anchored, seemingly waiting for orders to advance. However, it is reported that many of the newly arrived ground troops are not accustomed to the water and have been staying on the ships for a long time. Many of them have been suffering from seasickness and cannot endure the hardship.

Central News Agency reports that two enemy ships, the Beifa Maru and the Tianxiang Maru, sailed into the Huangpu River yesterday. The Beifa Maru docked at the enemy command ship Izumo at buoy number two at 1:00 PM and, after unloading a large quantity of munitions, sailed away from the Izumo at around 3:00 PM. The Tianxiang Maru docked at the Zhaoshangju North Wharf, where there were many enemy soldiers unloading munitions from the ship. The situation was very busy. As of 5:00 PM, when the reporter left the area, the munitions had not yet been completely unloaded.

### Pudong's Defenses Are Extraordinarily Solid

Enemy Aircraft Fire on Non-Resisting Farmers – Such Behavior Violates Humanity

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) This morning, our newspaper reporter met with Mr. Jiang, representing a certain group in this city, who had just returned to Shanghai last night after visiting troops in the Pudong area. He gave a detailed account of the battle situation in the Pudong area. We have selected the details that can be disclosed and recorded them below to share with readers concerned about the Pudong area.

I (Mr. Jiang) crossed over to Pudong from the Gaochangmiao Wharf in Shanghai on the morning of the 24th of this month. At that time, the small trains had stopped running, so I hired a rickshaw to move forward. Enemy aircraft constantly roamed the skies. After traveling more than ten miles, I arrived at a certain place and met with senior military officers to convey the intentions of my visit. The officers expressed their gratitude and stated to me that since the Hong Yang incident, the Pudong area had not suffered from warfare. This was because the Pudong area was an unarmed zone where farmers and poor workers resided. They initially did not expect the stubborn enemy to invade our Songhu in this way. After encountering unexpected setbacks, they attempted to turn to the Pudong area for an advance. Therefore, our troops were ordered to station themselves here at night. On the night our troops arrived, enemy ships suddenly opened fire on us. Our troops retaliated with fierce artillery fire. After several nights of fierce fighting, the enemy was terrified. In recent days, enemy aircraft have often come to various parts of Pudong to reconnoiter and drop bombs, but to no effect. The most chilling thing that the enemy army does is to use aircraft to strafe defenseless farmers in various small villages and towns. The location of the enemy air force's base of operations, the aircraft carrier, is approximately in the sea far away from the Bailonggang area. That is because enemy aircraft are often seen taking off and landing in that area. During the first week or so of the war, the enemy used large logs arranged in rows and a large number of foreign-made motorboats, attempting to land in Nanhui and other places, but ultimately dared not attempt it lightly. Now, our military defense is becoming more solid. If the enemy comes, we will definitely give them a painful blow. According to a recent situation overview in the Pudong area announced by a certain military organization in Pudong: 
㊀ The fortifications are extremely solid. 
㊁ All sectors of the local community have been closely organized to investigate and arrest traitors, in order to prevent them from detecting military intelligence. 
㊂ Pudong refugees are being resettled in different areas to maintain public order and alleviate the people's hardships. 
㊃ On the evening of the 26th, seven enemy ships approached the New Mitsui Wharf. They initially strafed with machine guns, followed by twenty to thirty enemy soldiers landing, attempting to go ashore. Our troops suddenly launched a fierce attack, and the enemy fled back in disarray.

Also, at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, eight enemy aircraft came to the Pudong area to reconnoiter, circling for a long time, and dropped three bombs, all of which landed in the fields and caused no damage. They flew away after half an hour. At 4:30 PM, three more came, flying high in the clouds, reconnoitering for about half an hour before flying away.

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) Recently, a guest came to Shanghai from Nanhui and told reporters that Shanghai newspapers on the 25th reported that 1,200 enemy soldiers secretly landed on the Nanhui beach and were defeated by our troops, with only 100 survivors. This news is actually surprising. I (the guest) have lived in Nanhui for generations, about fifteen miles from the city. People come and go along the coast every day, and I have never heard of enemy troops landing. Since the August 13th war broke out, Nanhui has been heavily defended because of its strategic location, and has been in a state of high alert from the very beginning. In recent days, groups of aircraft have flown overhead at least two or three times, mostly enemy aircraft, with our air force also present at times. Sometimes, the aircraft flew low, only two or three hundred feet above the ground. The sound of gunfire from the Shanghai battle could be clearly heard. Our troops also occasionally passed through the area, and the order was excellent. The military and civilians were harmonious. Other than that, I have not seen or heard anything. This can be reported to fellow countrymen living abroad.

Impersonating Japanese Aircraft is Too Ridiculous

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th: Japanese propaganda claims that two Chinese military aircraft purchased from Japan, painted in Japanese colors and with Japanese markings, impersonated Japanese aircraft and dropped bombs on Japanese warships in the Huangpu River. A spokesman for the Chinese Air Force, upon hearing this news, immediately denied it absolutely and considered it an insult to the Chinese military. It is claimed that China has never purchased military aircraft from Japan, and the Chinese Air Force is particularly unwilling to imitate the behavior of the Japanese army and commit such a despicable act. Perhaps the Japanese Air Force's bombing was inaccurate, resulting in such a ridiculous outcome.

### Our Newspaper Reporter Discovers Battlefield Situation This Morning

Enemy Main Force Collapses North of Caowangmiao – Our Troops Kill Enemy Brigade Commander

Last night, our newspaper reporter, along with liaison officers Fang and Xie, and Deputy Officer Wang, went to the Luodian area at about 8:00 PM, detouring from the rear, and met with senior commanders who were directing operations at the front, discussing the situation of each route in detail. The following is a breakdown of what can be disclosed:

Luodian Area

The enemy troops landing north of Luodian at Shidongkou, about one division strong, were formed by drawing elite troops from the 43rd, 44th, and 47th Divisions into a joint formation with strong combat capabilities. Under the cover of warships and aircraft, they advanced towards our Luodian-Jiading line, attempting to break through the Jiading positions and cut off our army's rear. After being greatly encircled by our army from the east, south, and west, they were repelled by our army after dozens of attacks in recent days. The battle for the town of Luodian was particularly fierce. The other day (29th), a unit of the enemy army launched a fierce attack on Luodian. Beforehand, enemy warships concentrated their artillery fire, along with dozens of enemy aircraft, to bombard the Luodian town positions. Our defending soldiers resisted bravely under the artillery and bombs of the enemy army, advancing without retreating, fighting fiercely for several hours, and finally repelling the enemy army. However, our army suffered heavy losses in this battle. □□□□□□□□□□ sacrificed their lives for the country, which was a tragic and glorious death. That night, our side thickened our troops and launched a major counterattack, with fierce fighting all night. The enemy army finally collapsed to the northwest, and our army took the opportunity to pursue. By yesterday morning, our army had pursued to the Yanjiayouche area, and the enemy had collapsed and suffered heavy casualties. We captured many machine guns, rifles, and backpacks, and killed an enemy brigade commander, intercepting a copy of the battle plan. As of 11:00 PM yesterday, the main force of the enemy army's right wing had been forced back to the area north of Wudouzhen in Luodian. In the northwest area, there was still a unit of the enemy army, with our army positions to the southeast. Although each occupies half of Luodian, the enemy army there has been besieged by us for two days and nights. It is expected that it can be resolved that night (30th). Also, yesterday morning, in addition to a unit holding fast to the northwest line of Luodian, another unit of the main force was sent to attack our Jiading area. After our army received the report, it mobilized a large team of fresh troops from □□ to advance towards the northwest of Luodian. When they advanced to the vicinity of Shixianggong Temple, a battle occurred. The enemy army knew that we were prepared and occupied Shixianggong Temple, not daring to advance. After 6:00 PM, our army used concentrated firepower to attack the enemy army near the temple, and the enemy retreated because they could not hold out. Our army immediately recaptured Shixianggong Temple and followed up the pursuit, occupying Caowangmiao, which is north of the temple. At 0:20 AM this morning, when the reporter left the □□ headquarters, they were still confronting each other in the area north of Caowangmiao.

Wusong Area

In the Wusong area, the enemy troops who had secretly landed at Paotaiwan and Shizilin had long been cleared by our side. Although there are many enemy ships outside the harbor that occasionally attack us and aircraft that come to drop bombs from time to time, attempting to land again, our side is strictly guarded, making it impossible for them to take advantage of the situation. Therefore, there have been no changes in the past two days, and it is as quiet as usual. According to reports, the enemy's seaplane airfield is on the sea off Shizilin.

Zhanghuabang Area

There is still a regiment of enemy troops in Zhanghuabang, about 2,000 strong, still holding on to the villages east of Sitang, and they have built stronghold-style fortifications there, with barbed wire and other obstacles. However, our army has encircled them tightly, and although the enemy has repeatedly tried to break through, they have ultimately failed. It is also reported that a unit of the enemy army landed in Zhanghuabang again yesterday morning, but the number of troops is unknown. Along the Pu River from Yunzaobang to Wusong Town, there are still a few remaining enemy soldiers. Yesterday morning, they were attacked by our □□ unit, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. We captured a plate-armored ship at the river mouth.

Yangshupu Area

The enemy troops in the Zhanghuabang area have been trying to break through Jungong Road for days, in order to make contact with the enemy troops in the Hujiang University area and advance towards our Yinxiang Township. Their repeated attacks have all failed. Also, yesterday, the enemy set up nine 15-centimeter howitzers in Yangshupu and fired at various positions on Jiangwan Road. Our □□ side also retaliated with field artillery.

Forming Air Defenses

According to the Chief of Staff of the □□ Division, the enemy aircraft currently bomb and bomb our Dachang and other places every day, but the bombs they drop have no purpose and are simply wasting munitions. This shows the weakness of the enemy aircraft's reconnaissance capabilities. Now our □□□□□□□□□□□ is strictly forming air defenses. Yesterday (29th), two aircraft were shot down by us, so today (30th), the enemy aircraft no longer dare to fly low.

### American Merchant Ship President Hoover Accidentally Damaged by Aircraft Yesterday

Happened to be Sailing Between Japanese Transport Ships – Our Authorities Express Responsibility

Shrapnel Flew Up and Damaged Ship's Side

Central News Agency reports that our Air Force received reports that multiple Japanese transport ships were entering the port on the 30th, so at about 5:00 PM, aircraft were dispatched to reconnoiter outside the Songkou area. It happened that the American ship President Hoover was sailing and was between two Japanese ships, leading it to be mistakenly identified as a Japanese transport ship, so bombs were dropped on it. The bombs fell in the water next to the ship, and shrapnel flew up, causing slight damage to the ship's side 25 feet above the water. Seven crew members were injured, two of whom were seriously injured. Three passengers were frightened, but it was not serious. After this accident, the ship sailed straight to Kobe. The injured crew members were taken to Shanghai by a British ship for treatment.

Statement by Foreign Ministry Spokesman

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th: Regarding the Chinese aircraft accidentally bombing the American merchant ship, the Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a statement saying that on the 30th, Chinese aircraft accidentally bombed the American ship President Hoover outside Wusongkou, injuring several people. The Chinese government deeply regrets this. It goes without saying that Chinese military aircraft have no intention of attacking any third-country ships. According to initial investigation results, the Chinese Air Force received intelligence today that multiple Japanese transport ships were entering the port this afternoon, and the President Hoover happened to arrive at this time and was positioned between two Japanese ships, leading the Chinese aircraft to mistakenly believe that it was a Japanese transport ship and dropped bombs on it. The Chinese government, in addition to continuing to thoroughly investigate the truth about this unfortunate incident, is determined to bear the responsibility for it and intends to resolve it immediately. The authorities of this Ministry have begun contacting the American Embassy and have telegraphed Ambassador Wang in the United States, expressing the Chinese government's willingness to take responsibility to the American government.

Commentary

### Establishment of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty

— Hua

The Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty was signed in Nanjing on the 21st of this month. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs formally announced it the night before last. The treaty is announced at a time when the world is enveloped in war clouds, and East Asia is suffering from the poison of aggressors. Its most obvious significance is to show that China and the Soviet Union are both great nations that genuinely love peace. Although we have vast borders adjacent to each other, we have no conflict of interest whatsoever. Moreover, at a time when aggressors are rampant and violent, we have an increasingly important shared responsibility to jointly ensure peace and prevent aggressive wars.

The significance of the Non-Aggression Treaty is essentially passive, but its far-reaching influence is positive. This is because, on the one hand, the treaty guarantees the opposition to war and the maintenance of peace between the two contracting states. On the other hand, the treaty is a link in the world's peace mechanism. Its impact on international collective security is profound and immense. In recent years, the situation in Europe has been turbulent. However, due to the conclusion of the Franco-Soviet, Czech-Soviet, and many other non-aggression treaties, the international collective security mechanism has been able to regain strength. Furthermore, the rampant behavior of aggressors has not led to a catastrophic conflagration.

However, in explaining the positive significance of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty, we should solemnly point out that although the treaty's far-reaching influence can contribute to general peace, its direct effect is by no means to deal with any country, nor will it affect our respective original relations with other countries. In the process of Japan's aggression against China in recent years, on the one hand, it put forward the demand for 'joint anti-communism' to us, attempting to make China its sacrifice and jointly attack the Soviet Union. On the other hand, it falsely accused any friendly exchanges between China and any country such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union as 'using barbarians to control barbarians', considering it detrimental to its aggression against China. Perhaps after the publication of this Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty, the representatives of Japanese imperialism are already using their habitual tricks of slander and discord, fabricating all kinds of malicious rumors to provoke. However, we are by no means afraid of such slanderous rumors today. China is willing to maintain friendly and amicable relations with all democratic and peace-loving countries. This is a fact that is universally recognized. China and the United States have signed a treaty of amity. China and Britain have established an important loan. Recently, our Minister of Finance, Kong, made friendly exchanges with various countries in Europe, which is enough to show that our country's foreign policy is for broad peace and amity, and there is no intention to harm any country. Only the aggressors, with their butcher knives and wolf teeth, have cut themselves off from our country's peaceful and friendly relations.

Between China and the Soviet Union, we know that China's current national policy is to strive for national independence and liberation with all our strength. The Soviet Union's current national policy is to fully engage in socialist construction. Although these two national policies differ due to time and place, their basic trend is to consolidate world peace and promote human progress, which is completely consistent. In recent years, our country's struggles and efforts have been warmly sympathized with by the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union's dedicated construction has also been deeply admired by our country. Now, because of the conclusion of the Non-Aggression Treaty, the degree of friendly cooperation between the two sides has taken another step forward. While celebrating this diplomatic development, we deeply hope that the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union can take the spirit of this treaty as a foundation to cultivate a deeper friendship.

Our army is currently surrounding and resolving them. After the enemy troops retreated from Hengling City, it was completely empty. The city walls were dilapidated, but a lot of grain and ammunition were abandoned in the streets. After our army entered the city, they are currently clearing out the remaining enemies in the vicinity. (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)

[Baoding] On the night of the 29th, about a thousand enemies from the Yali area were preparing to advance. A small number of our plainclothes troops made contact with the enemy on the front, then circled around to the enemy's rear to harass them. Because the area was full of overlapping hills and ridges, the enemy suddenly heard gunshots from all around and thought that a large army had arrived from all directions. They were panicked and didn't know what to do. The enemy in front thought that our army was attacking and attacked backward, while the enemy in the rear also fired artillery to counterattack. Thus, they attacked each other all night, and only at dawn did they realize what had happened. As a result of self-destruction, the casualties were extremely heavy.

The British consulate took the list away. There are still some Taiwanese who do not want to leave and are hiding in Xiamen and Gulangyu. The municipal government stated that those who are virtuous and do not forget their motherland will be provided with safe zones for accommodation, and those who wish to restore their nationality will be given convenience to return to Taiwan from Xiamen.

According to hospital sources, the British Ambassador's condition has passed the critical stage and is improving day by day. His condition was even more improved yesterday.

### British Government Protests to Japan over the Shooting of British Ambassador by Japanese Aircraft

Presents Three Minimum Demands, Violation of International Law Cannot Be Tolerated

[London] Regarding the injury of Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China, by a Japanese aircraft, the British government has submitted a note to the Japanese government yesterday. Its contents were announced at 5:00 p.m. today, concluding with the following three requests: ㊀ The Japanese government should formally apologize to the British government. ㊁ The Japanese perpetrators should be punished according to the severity of the circumstances. ㊂ The Japanese authorities should provide guarantees and take all necessary measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

Full Text of the Note

The note first describes the circumstances of Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen's injury, saying that this accident is regrettable. The British government is deeply saddened and extremely concerned to hear the news, and is forced to lodge a firm protest and demand full compensation. "It is inevitable that ordinary warfare practices will indirectly create a risk of injury to non-combatants, including foreigners, residing within the borders of the country concerned. However, international law contains one of the oldest and most established rules, that any direct or intentional attack on non-combatants, whether inside or outside a war zone, is prohibited, and aircraft attacks are not to be regarded as an exception. The argument that it was accidental cannot be accepted either, as the facts show that the Japanese perpetrators were at least negligent of the lives of ordinary people and completely disregarded them. In short, this incident was not an accidental event arising from any ordinary warfare practice, but it is clear that the Japanese aircraft attacked non-combatants, which should have been apparent to the perpetrators.

Furthermore, the Japanese side's claim that the car's flag was too small and difficult to see is also unfounded. Even if the car had no flag, there would be no reason to attack it. Regardless of whether the passengers in the car were foreigners and diplomats, it is a fact that they were non-combatants. It is now clear that the Japanese aircraft did not intentionally attack the British Ambassador, but it is undeniable that they wanted to attack non-combatants. This alone is an illegal act.

In addition, there is one more thing that needs to be noted, that the area where Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen was traveling was not a war zone and had no Chinese troops. The British government now takes this opportunity to point out that this case has a greater significance, as this type of accident is a natural result of the indiscriminate use of attacks by the air force, and it is even more inhumane and illegal to attack combatants and non-combatants indiscriminately. Moreover, in the current situation, the existence of a state of war has not been declared or explicitly recognized by either China or Japan, so the actions of the Japanese aircraft are even more inexcusable," and so on. (Reuters dispatch, 29th, via Havas)

British Note Delivered to Japanese Foreign Ministry

[Tokyo] The British note regarding the attack on British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen by Japanese aircraft was submitted to Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota by British Chargé d'Affaires Dodd today. Hirota claimed that the joint British-Japanese investigation into this matter is currently underway in Shanghai, and that he will contact the British Chargé d'Affaires as soon as he receives the results of the investigation. (Reuters dispatch, 29th, via Central News Agency)

[London] Regarding the injury of British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen by Japanese aircraft strafing, news has come from the Japanese side that the United Kingdom and Japan will conduct a joint investigation. British officials recently declared that they have no knowledge of this matter, and said that the British authorities have already completed the investigation. The so-called "conducting an investigation" refers specifically to the Japanese side. (Havas dispatch, 30th, via Central News Agency)

[London] Diplomatic circles here recently commented that the British note to Japan was quite moderate in nature. The three demands made by the United Kingdom are the minimum and it is believed that the Tokyo government will be able to give a satisfactory reply, and it is said that when British Chargé d'Affaires Dodd delivered this note, he must have requested the Japanese government to submit a reply quickly, and must have taken the opportunity to reiterate to the Japanese authorities the need to neutralize the Shanghai International Settlement. As for whether Japan will refuse to accept the three demands made by the United Kingdom, diplomatic circles have not commented, but according to private sources, if Japan does so, the United Kingdom may recall its envoy to Japan. The newly appointed British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, recently set off for Japan to take office and has now arrived in Canada, and may be waiting for government instructions before continuing his journey. (Havas dispatch, 29th, via Central News Agency)

Britain Has No Intention of Taking Retaliatory Action

[London] The British protest submitted to Japan regarding the attack on Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen was carefully worded and is still moderate. The demands it makes are widely regarded as fulfillable without damaging national dignity. According to the opinions of people from all walks of life in Britain, the fact that Japan's imprudent actions have invited this protest is itself sufficient condemnation. The protest does not mention retaliation, and it is heard that the British government does not intend to take further action if Japan does not accept the demands contained in the protest. The British side believes that if Japan refuses these demands, it will directly show the world that Japan is a country that does not respect any international morality. As for the rumor that the United Kingdom will demand compensation, according to the British government, this matter is of great importance and cannot be settled with money. To demand compensation would be to lose one's dignity. The protest does not specify a date for the Japanese government to respond, but the British government hopes that the reply can be issued early so that it is not delayed. (Reuters dispatch, 30th, via Central News Agency)

### British Press Commentary

Thinking Big, England Continues Efforts for Peace

[London] London newspapers overwhelmingly approve of the British government's note to Japan regarding the injury to British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. The Times states that the note's wording is considered fair by the public. The British government cannot make lesser demands regarding this "shocking act of violence." However, should the British government's demands be more forceful, resentment would be justified, but should not control reason. Now that the demands are extremely reasonable, it is hoped that the Japanese government will immediately and clearly satisfy them. The newspaper further states, "Japan, in its dealings with China, has caused serious damage to the world's civilization structure by disregarding international law. Japan is a great nation and has its own future.  Many of its people are blinded by narrow-minded realities, but those with more reason and foresight will understand that Japan's position in an orderly world and the gradually constructed rules of civilization will be richer than what it can seize by force in a lawless world." The Times continues, stating that the British government, without sacrificing its rights, will continue to strive for peace. However, the current issue concerns the attack on non-combatants, so the British government is not thinking small, but wants to uphold fundamental principles and prevent them from collapsing. Furthermore, the Morning Post states that the entire British public will unanimously support the wording of the note. This "deeply distressing attack" on the British ambassador has shocked the entire United Kingdom. No milder protest can be made regarding this unforgivable act. The newspaper continues, stating that the limit of demands cannot be lowered any further, and the Japanese government should have provided satisfaction immediately without the British government's demands. It is strange that the British government has been forced to resort to protest. The Morning Post also states, "We do not believe that Britain's demands will not receive a good response in Japan, as Japan should not forget the long-standing friendship between Britain and Japan." The Daily Express states that, for the sake of the Japanese government, it should immediately accept the British government's demands and resolve this unfavorable situation for Japan. The changes in the entire situation between China and Japan have made Tokyo feel uneasy. Japan is currently facing a shortage of food, a sharp decline in exports, and the country is on the verge of bankruptcy. The News Chronicle's editorial states that the demands made in the British note should have been given long ago by any responsible government that cares about its own dignity. The Daily Telegraph states that the note is extremely stern but its wording is very humble. The natural expectation is that the Japanese government should immediately satisfy it. The prohibition against attacking non-combatants on land and sea has long been a universally recognized principle. If this principle cannot be applied to the air force, the civilization of the world will face the fear of extinction. The Daily Citizen states that in a world without a strong peace organization, the fear of this can be seen in this British note. Therefore, the future British foreign policy should proceed along the path of restoring the League of Nations. (Central News Agency, 30th Reuters)

### Japan's Disregard for Law Will Inevitably Lead to Its Own Destruction

[London] The Manchester Guardian today criticized the attack on British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, stating that it is part of Japan's entire policy in China. The Latin saying, "In times of war, law is disregarded," is now increasingly believed. Both Europe and the Far East disregard the law not only in times of war, but also in times of peace. The world's true anarchists are not found in Barcelona and Moscow, but in Rome, Tokyo, and other places that violate laws, treaties, and good faith. England's only path is to closely unite with those who oppose the disregard for law and believe that unscrupulous behavior will inevitably lead to self-destruction. (Central News Agency, 30th Reuters)

### Moscow Announces Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact

Considered Another Step Towards Promoting Peace

[Moscow] The Soviet Foreign Ministry today announced the full text of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact without comment. Reuters reporters visited the authorities to inquire about the possibility of Soviet aid, but officials generally declined to comment. According to qualified observers, the Red Army will only take action if Outer Mongolia is attacked, as the Soviet Union has a mutual assistance treaty with Outer Mongolia. All sectors of the Soviet Union welcome the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, viewing it as another step towards promoting peace, and believing that China will no longer oppose the Soviet-Mongolian treaty. It is known that the Soviet Union has a special army permanently stationed in the Far East, numbering approximately 400,000 to 500,000 men. It is not known whether the Soviet Union has transported more troops and supplies to the Far East in the past few days. (Central News Agency, 29th Reuters)

[Paris] The Times' editorial recently elaborated on the Far Eastern situation, stating that the Non-Aggression Pact signed between China and the Soviet Union does not add any new factors to the current Far Eastern crisis beyond the already known elements. The most noteworthy thing is that the negotiation of this Non-Aggression Pact occurred precisely during the evolving period of the conflict between China and Japan, which will inevitably greatly shock Tokyo. However, Soviet intervention in the conflict between China and Japan can probably be avoided. First, judging from the domestic situation in the Soviet Union, the Moscow government is unable to engage in war. Second, Soviet diplomacy is quite active in Europe, while in the Far East, it has consistently adopted a reserved attitude. (Central News Agency, 30th Havas)

### Japan's Blockade of Chinese Coast

Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Answers Questions from Foreign Reporters

[Tokyo] On the 27th, foreign reporters raised five questions regarding the issue of cutting off navigation. On the 30th, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson responded to the questions as follows: 'First Question': What is the meaning of peaceful commerce? Does it depend on the ship's registry or the nationality of the cargo owner? 'Answer': It refers to peaceful commerce carried out by ships of third countries. 'Second Question': What is the meaning of a 'good faith' ship or a 'malicious' ship? 'Answer': There is no room to consider Chinese ships as 'good faith.' Generally, third-country ships are not considered malicious. 'Third Question': What measures will be taken against malicious ships? 'Answer': According to the purpose of cutting off traffic, there is no intention to indiscriminately confiscate ships and cargo, not exceeding the scope of defensive measures. 'Fourth Question': If a Chinese ship falsely claims British or other foreign nationality and flies a foreign flag, what measures will be taken? 'Answer': If a Chinese ship falsely claims another nationality and flies a third-country flag, it will naturally not be exempt from traffic blockade measures. 'Fifth Question': How will Japan stop non-peaceful commerce? 'Answer': It varies depending on the occasion, but respecting the peaceful commerce of third countries. (30th Central News Agency)

### French Press Advocates Supplying Airplanes to China

[Paris] The "Echo de Paris" recently published an article discussing the importance of the air force's position in the Far Eastern War, stating that the repeated bombings of major Chinese cities by Japanese airplanes are enough to arouse a strong reaction from the British and Americans. Therefore, material assistance should be given to China in terms of the air force. In the future, China may even bomb the Japanese islands. The buildings in Japanese cities such as Yokohama and Nagasaki are mostly wooden and easily catch fire. Once bombing is implemented, the damage will inevitably be severe. (Central News Agency, 29th Havas)

### Soviet Political Commentator Karl Radek Has Been Released

[London] The "Daily Express" reports that, according to reports from Moscow, Karl Radek, former editor of "Izvestia," who was sentenced to ten years in prison in January of this year, has now been released by the Soviet authorities. It also states that Stalin has issued an order to end the interrogation of "Trotskyites" by November 20. (10th Seathorn Telegram)

### Many Leaders of the Soviet Communist Youth League Arrested

On Suspicion of Espionage

[Moscow] The Soviet Communist Youth League, known as Komsomol, has a total of five million members. Currently, dozens of its main leaders have been arrested on charges of being "enemies of the people." (Central News Agency, 29th Reuters)

### Italian Prime Minister to Visit Hitler in Germany

Berlin Prepares Grand Welcome

[Berlin] Regarding Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's visit to Germany, well-informed sources recently stated that the Italian Prime Minister is scheduled to arrive in Germany before September 25. He will first go to Berchtesgaden on the 22nd or 23rd to hold talks with Führer Hitler, and then come to Berlin. Berlin has already begun preparations for a grand welcome. The ceremony will use tens of thousands of Italian flags, hanging everywhere, and countless floodlights will illuminate the entire city. The upper ends of the lights will be decorated with the German Nazi Party emblem and the Italian Fascist Party emblem. Two thousand musicians are rehearsing a grand musical program every day in the Olympic Stadium to be performed when welcoming the Italian Prime Minister. In addition, mechanized units and other units of the German Army will also line up on the motor road from Berlin to Stettin before the Italian Prime Minister departs for home, so that they can be reviewed by the Italian Prime Minister and Hitler. Italian Police Chief Bocchini recently arrived in Berlin today with several staff members and will meet with German Police Chief Himmler to discuss the necessary measures to protect the Italian Prime Minister's safety.

### Soong Tzu-wen Reports on the Significance of National Salvation Bonds

Used to Supplement National Defense Military Expenses, Different from Other Bonds

(Central News Agency) The General Association of the National Salvation Bond Promotion Committee was established a few days ago. Yesterday, it specially invited the local press to report on the significance, work, and progress of the promotion. The provincial and municipal branch associations and county branch offices are also actively being organized and are expected to be completed in about half a month, so as to concentrate national efforts to widely promote the subscription. Currently, various rules are being formulated, with particular emphasis on accounting procedures, in order to be orderly. The following are the details:

Chairman Soong Reports on the Significance of Issuance

The association hosted the local press yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM. Chairman Soong Tzu-wen first gave a speech, reporting on the significance of issuing national salvation bonds, saying that our country has been striving for peaceful construction in recent years, and has not been able to devote all its efforts to national defense and military affairs. This time, Japan suddenly invaded with force, and the people's assets have been greatly damaged. In order to consolidate national defense and protect the people, the government has specially issued 500 million yuan of national salvation bonds to be used to supplement national defense military expenses. This bond is different from other bonds. The interest rate is only 4%, and it is issued at full face value. Although the interest is relatively low, it is deeply believed that compatriots across the country, out of patriotic enthusiasm, will definitely subscribe enthusiastically, and the government will also strive to maintain its credit. It is hoped that the press will widely publicize it.

Deputy Director Zhang of the Promotion Group Reports

Deputy Director Zhang Shou-yong of the Promotion Group reported: ㊀ The significance of the promotion: The National Government believes that the promotion of these national salvation bonds is a matter of the people's patriotic enthusiasm, and there must be a strict organization and public accounting in order to gain trust. Therefore, a National Salvation Bond Promotion Committee was established, with a general association in Shanghai, and branch associations in various provinces and cities. In view of the people's desire to save the country, the people are not to be made to simply make donations, but to make the people buy bonds. Therefore, the interest rate is set at 4%, which is almost equal to the interest rate of the people's savings. ㊁ Organization of the promotion agency: The General Association of the Promotion Committee is the highest agency, with four groups managed by members: 1. General Affairs, 2. Fundraising, 3. Propaganda, 4. Accounting, 5. Audit Committee. Branch associations are established in various provinces and cities, and branch offices are established in various counties. Those directly under the General Association, such as the Overseas Chinese Promotion Committee, and the various circles in Shanghai, including the business, industrial, educational, and civilian circles, are organized into general teams and sub-teams to undertake the work. ㊂ Promotion methods: The fundraising agency and the collection agency are clearly separated. The fundraising agency has been described above. The collection agencies include the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank, Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and other designated banks. Cash and coins, gold and silver, gold and silver products, securities, and deposit receipts collected are entrusted to the banks for collection. However, temporary receipts should be given for gold and silver products, securities, and deposit receipts, and then bonds should be given according to the actual amount. Other items are received in a separate warehouse. Real estate and items that can be readily converted into cash are entrusted to other agencies for valuation, and then bond tickets are given according to the value. ㊃ Requesting assistance from all sectors for the promotion: Every man has a responsibility for the country's survival. Who is not as good as me in terms of being good? It is hoped that all sectors will do their best to assist in the promotion. During the European War, the burden of war bonds was 249 yuan per person in the United States, 589 yuan in Germany, and 768 yuan in France. Although our country's economy is not comparable to that of the United States, Germany, and France, with a population of 450 million, the average is only slightly more than one yuan. Everything depends on your efforts to advocate and achieve practical results.

Rules for Filling Out Receipts by Collection Agencies

Rules for Filling Out Receipts by the Collection Agencies of the National Salvation Bond Promotion Committee ㊀ Receipts of this association are divided into the following three types (format attached separately): (A) National Salvation Bond Receipt, used when receiving national currency cash for national salvation bonds. (B) National Salvation Bond Goods Receipt, used when receiving various goods other than national currency cash. (C) National Salvation Bond Goods Temporary Receipt, used when receiving various goods whose value cannot be determined until they are sold or appraised. After the value of the item is determined, the bond subscriber should exchange this receipt for a type B receipt from the original collection agency. ㊁ The receipts of this association are printed and distributed by the General Association to the branch associations and collection agencies for unified use. However, those far away may print them directly from the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank according to the format stipulated by the General Association, affixing the joint seal of the local branch associations, and distributing them to the collection agencies in the area. ㊂ Each type of receipt is divided into three copies. The first copy of the receipt is signed and sealed by the collection agency and affixed with the seal of the person in charge, and given to the subscriber for safekeeping. The second copy is a report form, which is signed and sealed by the collection agency and sent to the local association on a daily basis. The third copy is a stub, which is kept by the collection agency for future reference. ㊃ When applying various receipts, the collection agency should first code the abbreviation of each collection agency, and then prefix it with the abbreviation of the location of the agency. For example, the Shanghai Central Bank uses the word "Hu Zhong," the Nanjing Bank of China uses the word "Jing Guo," the Guangdong Bank of Communications uses the word "Yue Jiao," and so on, for the sake of regulation. ㊄ Each type of receipt used by the collection agency should be numbered by the agency, starting from number one and going down in order, and cannot be changed or replaced. ㊅ Bond subscribers will later present the receipts issued by the collection agencies to the original agencies to exchange for national salvation bonds of the same amount.

Working Situation of the Accounting Office of the Promotion Association

### Corpse Collection and Burial Completed at the South Railway Station

On the afternoon of the 28th, enemy planes bombed the South Railway Station, causing casualties among the people. Afterwards, various ambulance groups rushed to the scene and rescued hundreds of injured men and women, sending them to various hospitals for treatment. The Shanghai Charity Association and Tongren Fuyuantang sent personnel with carts to carry out more than 30 bodies to the Nanshi Rescue Bureau for temporary placement. Because it was curfew time, there was not enough time to stay, so they continued to go the next morning. Most of the bodies had already been collected by Pushan Villa people overnight. Therefore, only more than 30 bodies were found in the rubble and sent to the Rescue Bureau. The intact bodies were numbered and photographed as usual. The incomplete bodies were recorded in detail according to their clothing and then collected. The money and belongings were copied from each body, numbered, registered, and preserved for future identification by family members. Three employees and two trackmen were killed in this battle at the station. The Railway Bureau gave them generous coffins and buried them temporarily, waiting for their families to claim them later, and agreed to provide compensation. Each injured employee was given 50 yuan for medical expenses. The station platform repair work has not yet started. It will be difficult to restore it to its original state in the shortest period of time. The estimated loss is more than 100,000 yuan. The station has also carried out disinfection work.

### Various Organizations Send Refugees Back to Their Hometowns

The Municipal War Zone Refugee Relief Committee and other organizations are sparing no effort in their refugee relief work.

In recent days, more than 35,000 people from the countryside, such as Suzhou, Hangzhou, Huzhou, or Wuxi, have been transported to the interior by ships, trains, and small boats. The remaining refugees whose ancestral homes are Shaoxing, Haiyan, Yixing, and Yunnan are also being processed for repatriation.

### The Propaganda Committee of the Support Association Promotes Anti-Japanese Propaganda Work

Using English, French, Russian, and Japanese for Broadcasting and Performances So That People of All Countries Can Obtain Accurate War Reports

The Propaganda Committee of the Municipal Anti-Japanese Support Association has been working intensively in recent days. In addition to entertaining foreign guests and providing information some time ago, and notifying various cultural organizations to proceed in unison, it has recently intensified its efforts using various propaganda tools. The general overview of the committee's propaganda work is specially recorded below:

Broadcasting in Foreign Languages

The committee, considering that there are many friendly people in Shanghai from foreign countries, who have witnessed the Sino-Japanese War firsthand and have accurate information, believes that public opinion can influence the policies of their countries. Therefore, it is scheduled to begin broadcasting and lecturing in foreign languages from 6:00 tonight to promote international propaganda. Wang Naizheng and Wang Suizhi have been invited to give lectures in French, Ms. Zeng Shirong to give lectures in English, Wu Qingyou to give lectures in Russian, and Zhou Wenbin and Yuan Wenzhang to give lectures in Japanese. The schedule has been prepared and is now being implemented.

Cartoon Propaganda Sets Off

The first cartoon propaganda team, organized by the committee in conjunction with the cartoon book industry, led by Ye Qianyu, departed last night to the Suzhou-Wuxi-Beijing-Hankou area. They will use the art of cartoons to promote the spirit of resistance against Japan, to awaken the public to the common hatred and fight against the enemy, and to work together for the war of resistance. It is heard that after Mr. Ye and others arrive in the provincial capitals, they will further contact the local cartoon book industry to create similar organizations to go to work in the countryside. In this way, the widespread and in-depth results will be even more significant.

Producing Anti-Japanese War Films

The committee believes that this time our country's war of resistance is not only a war of self-defense but also contains great historical significance. Advancing means fully expressing the spirit, and retreating also means making a heroic sacrifice. It is passionate, tragic, and worthy of praise. If it can be filmed and shown everywhere, it will be most effective in awakening the public and inspiring morale. Therefore, in conjunction with the Shanghai branch of the Educational Film Association, it has begun producing various anti-Japanese war films. Recently, the Japanese air force indiscriminately bombed unarmed civilians at Nanjing Road, the South Railway Station, and other places, and all kinds of atrocities have been captured on film. In the future, the public will never forget this great hatred.

Forming Anti-Japanese Choral Teams

The way of sound is the most touching, and if it can be used well, it is a great tool for propaganda. The patriotic spirit of comrades in the singing circles of this city is particularly enthusiastic. Now, all the more than ten choral groups in Shanghai have been led by the committee to form anti-Japanese choral teams, which have begun singing at radio stations, wounded soldier hospitals, refugee shelters, and other places to inspire the spirit of common hatred.

### Gan Naiguang and Others Arrive in Shanghai to Console Soldiers

Cultural Circles and Children's Circles Separately Console Wounded Soldiers

Central special envoys Gan Naiguang and Mao Zuquan arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday and went to the front lines yesterday morning to console the anti-Japanese soldiers on all fronts.

The Shanghai Cultural Circles National Salvation Association organized a consolation group yesterday to go to various wounded soldier hospitals to console them. They gathered at the association's office on Weihaiwei Road at 3:00 yesterday afternoon and set off at 4:00, totaling twenty-six teams, each with five people, carrying large quantities of consolation items such as handkerchiefs, socks, and shirts. When the team arrived at the wounded soldier hospitals to console them, in addition to making brief speeches to the lightly wounded soldiers, they also provided services such as washing the wounded soldiers' faces.

The Children's Circles National Salvation Association transported a large number of undershirts and wounded soldiers' clothing and trousers to the Wuxi Tongyi Association Wounded Soldier Hospital yesterday morning by representatives of all members. Chen Juanjuan, Tang Genbao, Yang Bijun, Xu Xiangying, Xu Bi, Wang Ziqing, and others sang and gave speeches to console the wounded soldiers, who all stood up to thank them with great anger. They then went to the Eleventh Wounded Soldier Hospital on Dahua Road to console them. In the afternoon, two members were sent to the front lines with the ambulance team to transport undershirts and towels printed with the large red characters "Return Our Rivers and Mountains" to console the anti-Japanese soldiers.

### Land and Water Transportation Gradually Resumes

Trains Between Shanghai and Ping Stop at Suzhou Foreign Ships Successively Set Sail for Export

After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, all shipping traffic was completely suspended. Since the Taikoo Company's Shengjing wheel test voyage the day before yesterday, Jardine Matheson and other companies are also seeking to resume. Among those exporting yesterday, the Taikoo Company had the Xin Beijing wheel, which sailed to Shantou, chartered by the Chaozhou and Shantou Fellow Villagers Association, to load refugees returning to their hometowns. The Longshan wheel left Shanghai at 9:30 yesterday morning for Ningbo, carrying many refugees. The Shengjing wheel, which arrived in Shanghai, began loading goods yesterday and is scheduled to sail to Tianjin today. Therefore, the water transport in Shanghai, in addition to Chinese ships, can gradually return to its original state.

From the 30th, in addition to the Beijing-Suzhou train running as usual, the original express train at 8:00 am and the Shanghai-Ping trains at 6:00 pm, which passed through the Sujia Road and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road to the Shanghai South Railway Station, have been changed to run to the Suzhou Station as the terminus. The Sujia train will still run as usual. Two more batches of more than 2,000 refugees arrived in Xiaguan on the 30th, and efforts are being made to relocate them. (Special dispatch on the 30th)

### Charity Groups and Disaster Relief Associations Relieve Refugees in the Nanshi Area

Rescuing More Than 2,000 People Providing Shelter and Supplies as Much as Possible

The Municipal Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, in response to the fact that the Nanshi area has been subjected to enemy aircraft wantonly bombing and machine-gunning our innocent people for days, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries, and leaving refugees in a dilemma and in urgent need of rescue, specially dispatched a large number of vehicles yesterday to provide relief several times, rescuing more than a thousand people and transporting them to various shelters for temporary supplies, and adding Minle, Hangzhou, and Guoguang three shelters to accommodate as much as possible.

### The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs Orders Dance Halls to Close Down

The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, based on reports that dance halls such as the Great Shanghai International and others have resumed business one after another under the guise of relief, believes that during this period of war, there should be no such meaningless entertainment. The bureau has already ordered the dance halls to immediately close down within days.

### The Life-Saving Bureau Negotiates the Retrieval of Floating Corpses in the Huangpu River

The enemy army invaded Shanghai and killed our innocent civilians, throwing the corpses into the Huangpu River. The corpses struck each other in groups of three or five, flowing up and down with the tide of the Huangpu River, with numerous wounds, which was unbearable to witness. Moreover, as time goes by, the sun exposure and water immersion make them rotten and smelly. Prolonged exposure to the tide pollutes the salt water, which affects the drinking hygiene of millions of citizens in this city. The Nanshi Life-Saving Bureau, a charitable organization in this city, plans to retrieve, collect, and bury them, but is afraid that the warships will disregard morality and shoot, which is very dangerous. It is now planned to negotiate with the British and French Industry Bureaus and the health agencies to find a way for the Life-Saving Bureau to send life-saving boats with laborers to search for and retrieve floating corpses along the upper and lower reaches of the Huangpu River, and try to collect and bury them to restore sanitation.

The enemy army's brutal means of destroying our country's cultural institutions are further proven here.

### The North China Daily News Bitterly Criticizes the Atrocities of Japanese Aircraft Bombing the South Railway Station

Konoe Said, 'China Must Be Beaten Until It Kneels' Only Increasing the Spirit of Resistance Against Japan and the Indignation of Global Public Opinion

The North China Daily News published a commentary yesterday on the bombing of the South Railway Station by Japanese planes, which read: Japanese Prime Minister Konoe announced to the world, saying, 'Japan must beat China until it kneels and no longer has the spirit to fight.' The Japanese people, if they can truly know how this mission is being carried out today, they will surely be shocked by it, and those who are more thoughtful among them will even doubt it. Several Japanese planes bombed the South Railway Station in the Nanshi area the other day. Observers with a little knowledge can know that the place is full of hundreds of displaced refugees, waiting to escape to Hangzhou to avoid the disaster. The Japanese army's determination to implement an orderly terror to achieve Konoe's goals, now there is no need to waste ink expressing enthusiasm and commenting on it. However, the bombing of Nanshi is a frenzied crime that everyone can imagine violating humanity and must be condemned. The Japanese authorities' claim that Chinese troops happened to be passing through Nanshi at the time cannot be used to cover up the fact that even if it were true, Japanese planes would never have bombed such a large crowd of terrified women and children. Moreover, according to the Chinese army commander, there were no soldiers or military vehicle positions in Nanshi. The actions of the Japanese army seem to be ordered to commit violence and fill the eyes of the world. Today, Shanghai's refugees are coming like a tide, distraught and in hardship, which cannot be described, but all are bravely enduring it. This can be seen everywhere on the sidewalks and in the alleyways. Among these people, there are many mothers who bravely risk death and try to suppress their fear to protect their children. Their Japanese mothers, living comfortably in their own country, if they could see the crimes that the Japanese people have committed against Chinese mothers and children, they would be shocked. This kind of thinking cannot help but arise in the minds of evil people. What Nanshi suffered, everyone has experienced it personally. Alas, in the name of 'purging' Hongkou 'building trees', how many atrocities have been committed behind the scenes?

If we express our full sympathy for the suffering of China as a result of this cruel and destructive act, then we must also express our fear of Japan. Konoe cannot deceive himself into thinking that he can defeat a 'great power' with such means of terrorism, making it kneel. History and psychology tell us that a nation that is united and resists foreign enemies is motivated by brute force and irresponsible evil words and is not deterred by them, whether it is Chinese or not, and cannot be subdued. Sino-Japanese friendship is beneficial to Japan, no less than to China. Now, with reckless and cruel actions, it shows that it cannot respect the contract of human relations, so what chance is there to create it? It is sometimes difficult to control new-era destructive weapons, but when control obviously fails and the area of slaughtering civilians is expanded, from occasional to intentional, there is really nothing to argue about. Japan itself, for the military problems of China, must be able to achieve a rapid and broad solution, but repeatedly committing such atrocities will only make its work more difficult. The result of this kind of atrocity is only enough to strengthen the Chinese people's will. Nanjing now regards air strikes as commonplace, which shows that the unity of China, which was difficult to hope for a few weeks ago. The weapons and equipment of the Chinese army, although inferior to the Japanese army, their bravery the Japanese people have to prove it. Those foreigners in contact with the Chinese army in the western district praised the Chinese army for its strict discipline, its united will, and its vow to kill the enemy. Now, it is given a reason for a fervent support of national rights, which is no small matter. Then, what effect can the arbitrary slaughter of civilians have? It only makes the Chinese people more believe that Japan's ultimate goal is to reduce the Chinese people to slaves, and thus arouse the common hatred. The word 'I would rather die than be a slave' has now been used by Chinese soldiers as a motto to resist the enemy to the death. Although Japanese spokespersons will dismiss it as a 'rhetorical phrase', world history is full of evidence that this kind of determination will reduce the difference between the strong and the weak and should not be underestimated.

Foreigners in China all acknowledge that the root cause of this war is Japan's entrustment of its national conscience to military aggression. This is in line with the world's emotions, and therefore all condemn Japan's current adventurous attempts. At the same time, foreigners here have different views and allow for the recent statement by British Foreign Secretary Eden regarding Japan's economic difficulties. However, this newspaper (the North China Daily News) has always believed that one cannot forcibly seize another's property for economic reasons. Courts in ordinary civilized societies often disagree with this view. This weak reason for reducing general criticism of Japan will be completely destroyed by Japan's actions. The bombing of Nanshi is the most recent and profound proof. Can Japan bear to intensify the world's hatred for Japan as a result of this? This is what everyone and sincerely wants to ask. The Chinese people and the government, forced by Japan, are trapped in a difficult position. The world expresses sympathy for them. This kind of sympathy has infinitely increased because of the infinite suffering suffered by the Chinese people. General public opinion is now finally aware of the cruelty of Japan's artificial indignation movement, borrowing the false name of revenge, and applying the thunder to the Chinese people. The attack by Japanese planes on the Shanghai-Nanjing highway, thanks to God's blessing, did not become a tragedy. The Chinese people were all happy, because they all felt that if everyone had died at the time, the Japanese would have falsely claimed that it was done by the Chinese army, and the Chinese would have no way to prove themselves. Cannot Japanese people with clear heads consider such things and use appropriate planning and humanity to change the policy of directing such inauspicious signs to use troops in Chinese territory? This kind of trampling on peaceful places and destroying happy families will have no end. Konoe's envoys may try to order China to kneel, but their actions are only enough to arouse the Chinese people's national salvation spirit and will be mourned by the descendants of Japan.

From 8 AM to 10 AM, it was quite quiet. However, it was reported that cannonballs frequently fell near the Guangzhao Villa in Zhabei. Several fires broke out in the Zhoujiazui Road area near the border of the Public Concession.

Frequent Enemy Troop Movements in the Eastern District

Most Concentrated at the Osaka and Other Docks

According to an employee of a certain company who took a steamer from Yangshupu to Shanghai a moment ago, the enemy's base in the eastern Shanghai district of Dinghaiqiao has seen frequent troop movements in recent days, seemingly with the addition of reinforcements. However, it is impossible to prove whether regular enemy troops participated. The areas with the most enemy troops currently concentrated in Yangshupu are the Osaka, Huangpu, and Mitsubishi docks. However, only a small number of enemy troops are stationed at the Huishan Dock.

Inhumane Acts by Enemy Aircraft

Bombing Refugees and the Wounded, Over Two Hundred People Perished

At about 10 AM yesterday, about two hundred refugees and wounded soldiers who had been rescued from the war zone were staying at the Yangxing Town Long-Distance Bus East Station. At that time, a squadron of enemy aircraft suddenly arrived, circling in the air several times, and suddenly dropped more than ten bombs. These more than two hundred displaced refugees and wounded soldiers, unable to escape, all perished. The enemy aircraft's repeated bombing of refugees and the wounded is inhumane and can be said to have reached its extreme.

The Situation of the Collapsing Enemy Troops Was Embarrassing

Guns and Uniforms Had Been Discarded, Wearing Only Undershirts and Short Military Pants

According to a tugboat crew member of a certain foreign shipping company, at 8 AM yesterday morning, they were heading to Yangshupu on business. On the way back, they saw several trucks carrying retreating Japanese soldiers at the Zhaoshang Central Warehouse in Hongkou. These soldiers had discarded their guns and uniforms and were only wearing undershirts and small short military pants. Their embarrassing appearance was indescribable.

Japanese Gunners Fired Aimlessly

Shooting Dozens of Miles Outside the War Zone, Only Destroying Houses and Not Injuring People

Japanese gunners are extremely inexperienced, often firing aimlessly. The night before last, they indiscriminately shelled non-combat areas in Pudong, causing cannonballs to destroy two houses belonging to Wu Zhusheng in the Shanghai circle, and also destroyed two houses belonging to Hai Long in Chenqi Bridge Village, Tangqiao. Because the villagers had all fled in recent days, no one was injured. However, the above two locations are dozens of miles away from the war zone, which proves the disruption caused by the Japanese.

Enemy Ammunition Steadily Transported to Shanghai

After two enemy transport ships, the Befa Maru and the Tensho Maru, arrived in Shanghai yesterday, bringing a large amount of ammunition, the Shanghai Maru continued to sail into Songkou last night and is now berthed at the Osaka Dock. According to an investigation by reporters this morning, the ship began unloading ammunition last night and, as of about 10 AM today, there were still thirty or forty enemy soldiers continuing to unload, which was very busy.

Foreign Ships Are Preparing to Resume Sailing

The Taikoo Shengjing Ship Resumes the North China Line, British Merchants' Marr Ship Carrying Refugees to Ningbo

After the war gradually shifted outwards, the situation in the local port became slightly more stable. Foreign shipping companies have begun preparing to resume sailing. At 7 AM this morning, the Taikoo Company's French Concession Wharf and the Huatong Company's two wharves in Pudong simultaneously resumed work. The Pudong Jiajiajiao Blue Funnel Taikoo Company also began shipping goods. In addition, the Taikoo Shengjing Ship, after importing yesterday morning, is scheduled to export this afternoon, resuming the North China liner route. A British-owned Marr Company merchant ship transported more than 2,000 refugees taken in by the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association back to Ningbo at the Zhaoshangju Jinliyuan Wharf at 10 AM this morning. It is heard that the British-owned Qiahe Company also intends to prepare for the resumption of sailing of its ships, but because the company's wharf and warehouse are located in the Hongkou war zone, it is inconvenient for passengers and goods to board and disembark, so progress is quite difficult. As for the factories and warehouses in Pudong, only the Yizhong Cigarette Factory in Lujiazui began shipping goods this morning because there is a shortage of goods everywhere and a large number of cigarettes are needed. There is no movement at other factories.

### We Submitted a Note to the League of Nations Detailing Japan's Aggression

Japanese Troops Violated Treaties and Attacked Chinese Cities, Making Every Effort to Destroy Our Decade of Construction

[Geneva] Dr. Hu Shize, the Chinese Minister to Switzerland, delivered a note to the Secretariat of the League of Nations this afternoon, detailing the conflicts between China and Japan since the Lugouqiao Incident on July 7. It is generally believed here that this is the prelude to China's complaint to the League of Nations. The note first stated that the Chinese government has always maintained a compromising attitude. In addition to fulfilling various agreements, it has repeatedly proposed to Japan to stop the war, but to no avail because Japan deliberately invaded and tried to expand the war. The conclusion is divided into four sections, the main points are as follows:

"(1) Japanese troops have invaded Chinese territory and used land, sea and air forces to attack Chinese cities in northern and central China. This is a purely aggressive action and is beyond doubt.

(2) Although China has exhausted all methods to prevent violent aggression, all have failed. It has no choice but to implement resistance. This is China's exercise of its natural right of self-defense.

(3) Japan's aggression against China was originally based on a predetermined plan. This plan began with the September 18 Incident in 1931 and is still being implemented. Although Japan has repeatedly stated that it has no territorial ambitions for China, it has occupied the Tianjin area and decided to advance into the entire North China in order to control other parts of China. It can be seen from the fact that Japan has made every effort to destroy China's construction projects, which have been painstakingly managed for ten years.

(4) Japan has violated various international treaties one by one. For example, the country's deliberate destruction of peace in the Far East violates the basic principles contained in the Covenant of the League of Nations. The country uses war to achieve its national policy and disdains the use of peaceful means to resolve international disputes. This violates the 1927 Pact of Paris. The country does not respect China's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. This violates the 1922 Nine-Power Treaty."

Finally, the Chinese government requested that the above-mentioned facts be notified to the member states of the League of Nations and the member states of the Advisory Committee (including the United States) established on February 24, 1934, due to the incident in the three northeastern provinces of China. (Central News Agency, Havas, 30th)

[Geneva] After the Chinese government submitted a note to the League of Nations accusing Japan of deliberate aggression, League of Nations officials commented that this was the prelude to China's formal complaint to the League of Nations. Although the Chinese government's note did not request that the dispute between China and Japan be placed on the agenda of the next regular session of the General Assembly of the League of Nations (which will be held on September 13), China is a semi-permanent member of the Executive Yuan and can file a complaint in accordance with Article 17 of the Covenant during the meeting of the Executive Yuan or the General Assembly of the League of Nations. Article 17 of the Covenant states that when a dispute arises between a member state of the League of Nations and a non-member state, the non-member state should be invited to recognize the obligations of the member state and resolve the dispute according to the conditions deemed proper by the Executive Yuan. (Central News Agency, Havas, 30th)

### Germany Not Surprised by the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty

Believes It Is A Way for Our Country to Ensure Security, Soviet Russian Newspapers Unanimously Support It

[Berlin] The political circles here do not express excitement about the signing of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty, but judge it with an objective attitude. Although some people worry that China may be influenced by Bolshevism in the future, on the other hand, they believe that General Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese government will actively implement anti-communist policies, and it is expected that their independence will not be affected by the Communist Party. Therefore, the German political circles tend to regard the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty as a security measure, believing that the purpose of the Chinese government is to avoid disputes that are harmful to China's efforts for peace and to enable China to mobilize its national defense forces. It is solemnly stated here that, from this point of view, it is not surprising that the Chinese government decided to conclude the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty. (30th National Haitong Telegram)

[Moscow] Regarding the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty, the local "News" reports that it is another manifestation of the Soviet Union's inviolable peace policy. The newspaper continues to elaborate on the principle of indivisible peace. The argument of "Pravda" is roughly the same as the above, and it is said that the conclusion of the treaty is sufficient to prove that the Soviet nation has a great liking for the Chinese nation's struggle for freedom and independence, and that the treaty itself is a new tool for peace and collective security. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 31st)

### Germany Does Not Lend Money to Japan

[Berlin] Well-informed sources here claim that the report published by a certain news agency, saying that Germany is willing to lend a huge amount of money to Japan for the purchase of military supplies, is not in line with the facts. It is solemnly stated here that Germany has no intention of taking this step in the future. (30th National Haitong Telegram)

### Fierce Fighting on the Pinghan Line for Several Days, Enemy Positions Have Been Shaken

Our Plainclothes Team Reached Changxindian Station, Liangxiang City Is Surrounded and Can Be Recovered Soon

[Baoding] Our reporter returned from an inspection of the front line on the 30th. (1) There are more than 20,000 enemy troops stationed along the Pinghan Line. The headquarters is located in the Changxindian Pinghan Workers' Union Auditorium. (2) Our vanguard is now at Nantianbao, confronting the enemy. (3) The fighting from the 20th to the 28th was extremely fierce. In the Battle of Pindingshan, we fought hand-to-hand with the enemy nine times, and the enemy suffered 3,000 casualties. (4) The front line was quiet on the 29th and 30th. (5) Our plainclothes team is very active. One team has reached Changxindian Railway Station. The enemy's position has been shaken. (6) Enemy aircraft have repeatedly dropped bombs on Fangshan, Zhuoxian, Liulihe, and Gaobeidian in recent days. Our losses were very light. Seventeen bombs were dropped on Liulihe on the 28th. (7) On the front of Pinghan, we have advanced to a certain area north of Doudian. (8) Liangxiang City has been surrounded by our heavy troops and can be recovered soon. (9) The enemy army between Ping and Chang has been cut off from contact by our plainclothes team. (30th Special Dispatch)

### Overseas Chinese Without Permits Deported from Guangdong

[Guangzhou] The Commissioner's Office of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi officially notified consuls on the 30th that all foreign residents and entrants must have passports. Those without passports and stateless people will be deported to prevent bandits from operating and to protect the safety of foreigners. (30th Central News Agency Telegram)

### Enemy Aircraft Attacked Xuzhou

[Xuzhou] At 6:30 on the evening of the 30th, six enemy aircraft flew to Xuzhou to attack and dropped more than ten bombs. (30th Special Dispatch)

### Brief Comments

— Xiang

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the inhuman actions of the enemy have been too numerous to describe. The most unbearable is the indiscriminate attacks by aircraft on innocent civilians everywhere. For example, the bombing of the Sincere Company on the Great Eastern Road and the bombing of the South Railway Station caused the tragic deaths and injuries of no fewer than a thousand innocent civilians. In addition, the attack on the British Ambassador and the massacre of Red Cross rescue workers are cruel acts of a barbaric nation and should not be committed by a self-proclaimed civilized country. Therefore, a Western newspaper said, "The Japanese are so violent, and Konoe said that China must be tied to its knees, which only increases the spirit of resistance against Japan and the indignation of global sentiment." It is indeed true. If Japan wants to tie China to its knees now, please stop dreaming this kind of sweet dream.

### A Glimpse of the Rear Area's Emotions Amidst the War of Resistance (2)

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya

After the Country Is Lost

When a country and nation are unfortunately subjected to persecution by a powerful country's army pressing on the border, step by step, if the officials and people of the whole country do not raise their arms and shout, and everyone rises up to take on the responsibilities that our ancestors have given us for thousands of years, and take on the responsibilities that hundreds of millions of descendants look up to us for, and resolve to die without changing, and risk a hundred deaths to fight for survival, then it will be very difficult to reverse the situation after the misfortune of the country's loss. Because the tools for destroying people's countries and exterminating people's races in modern times are really too vicious. Let me give a small example.

One day, on the grasslands of Kunming Lake, I saw two middle-aged men in ill-fitting Western suits exploring the meaning of whether China can truly resist Japan this time from a certain passage in Chiang Kai-shek's "Half-Month Record of Xi'an". The two men held positive and negative reasons, and their debates were deadlocked. At first, listening to their tone, I suspected that they were Cantonese. After chatting with them, I realized that they were Vietnamese Kuomintang members.

One of them said to me: He had participated in the "Anbai" uprising. After the failure, he fled to Yunnan. Unexpectedly, he and several other comrades were designed to be tied up by a "traitor" from his own ethnic group, hidden in a cargo box, and escorted back to Vietnam via the Yue Railway. Fortunately, he was discovered and released by customs midway, and almost suffocated in the box.

He continued: A few months ago, the Governor-General of Vietnam (French) visited Yunnan to visit the Yunnan authorities. They, these poor insects, were suddenly detained by the police station again. It is said that the police station was afraid that they would assassinate the Governor-General and cause trouble for the host! If the facts are indeed like this, then the pain they suffered spiritually must be a thousand times greater than the detention. Otherwise, suffering this "unforeseen disaster" is also a "wrongful grievance".

Finally, at the time of parting, they shook my hand tightly and said: "Friends! If you don't work hard to save the country before it is lost, and vainly hope to restore the country after it is lost, it is indeed a task that is as difficult as turning mountains and seas upside down! I hate that I have not mastered Chinese well enough to write this meaning in detail, in order to inform the compatriots of the motherland who are facing national disasters and still have the opportunity to resist Japan!" These heartfelt words from fellow countrymen suffering from the same disease, can they not touch the hearts of the people?

Ethnic Revolutionaries

In a certain village in Tengyue, western Yunnan, lives a "national revolutionary" who is nearly seventy years old. He is the Crown Prince of Burma, named "Jiang Kuo". If Burma had not been lost, he would, of course, be the one to inherit the orthodoxy and ascend the throne. But the ruthless reality has declared that he is a pathetic and tragic protagonist in the history of the country's loss.

When the British began to invade Burma in 1823, the Burmese in general felt the dim future of the nation, but were shocked by the strength of the British, and responded to all harsh demands with a "half-hearted" attitude. Later, when they saw that the situation was too bad, they hastily gathered a large army to carry out resistance, but unfortunately "the general trend was gone" and it was of no avail. By 1886 (sixty-three years after the start of the invasion), it was finally destroyed by the British.

"Jiang Kuo" was one of those who "knew that it was impossible to do it" and yet resolutely decided to protest with soldiers. His spirit of resistance, "knowing that it cannot be done and doing it," is ultimately worthy of our admiration. He now relies on practicing medicine and farming to solve his livelihood problems. Although his age is not without the illusion of the afterglow of the setting sun, his ideas of restoring the country are not depressed, and the secret promotion of the restoration movement has never been interrupted. Therefore, in this long period of more than forty years of exile, he has often gained the sympathy and assistance of people in terms of spirit and material.

During our national crisis, reading the little history of "Jiang Kuo" described above, we can at least gain three kinds of lessons: (1) When a country encounters foreign aggression, only having a psychology of retreat and complacency, without the determination to resist early, will inevitably lead to the destruction of the country. (2) The enemy uses the policy of gradually nibbling away, which is like our sitting and suffering the slow slicing of the head of the executioner. Don't say that the bits of skin and flesh can be endured, you must know that what follows is the heart. (3) National heroes who resist Japan and save the country, even if they ultimately fail, will inevitably gain infinite sympathy.

### Fierce Battle at Nankou

Tang Enbo's Troops Valiantly Resist the Enemy; Engagements at All Passes of the Great Wall

Zhangjiakou Dispatch: In recent days, battles have erupted at Nankou, south of the Ping-Sui Railway, and at various key passes along the Great Wall. Our troops defending the territory are determined to fight to the death against the enemy, resulting in extremely fierce battles. The situation of the battles on various fronts is recorded below:

Fierce Fighting at Nankou

At dawn on the 12th of this month, the Japanese army increased its forces by more than 5,000 infantry, 80 artillery pieces, and 30 tanks, launching a fierce attack on our Nankou positions. Simultaneously, fierce fighting also occurred in the areas of Huyucun, Deshenkou, and Sulin Kou near Nankou. By the end of the evening, the enemy had launched five or six fierce attacks on our positions, all of which were repelled by our forces. Thirty enemy aircraft also assisted their ground forces, constantly bombing our positions. Officers and soldiers of our Luo and Tan regiments were particularly brave. After the enemy retreated at night, they returned on the 13th with a large number of aircraft, tanks, and most of their land forces. Our defending soldiers also resisted desperately, making the fighting even fiercer than before, until nightfall when they entered a state of ceasefire. The enemy suffered heavy casualties in this battle, while our side also suffered some casualties. According to Chief of Staff Cui Gongchen of the ××× Division, General Tang (Enbo) reported in a telegram from Nankou this afternoon (the 13th) that the battle at Nankou today was exceptionally fierce. Our morale is doubly strong, and the enemy has suffered heavy losses. Our side has also suffered considerable losses, but even with the last soldier, we are determined to fight the enemy to the end. According to my own (Cui's own statement) observation, even if there are slight changes in our Nankou positions, it is due to strategic considerations and should not affect the overall situation.

Battle Situation at Various Passes of the Great Wall

According to Cui, the battle situation at various key passes along the Great Wall on the (above third) day was roughly as follows: ㊀ In the Shenweitai area, at noon, there were more than 70 enemy plainclothes soldiers, two tanks, three armored vehicles, and three aircraft. Their purpose seemed to be to scout our military positions. The enemy plainclothes soldiers first opened fire on us, and the tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft simultaneously assisted in the operation, fiercely attacking our positions. Our army responded calmly until 2 p.m., when the enemy was unable to sustain and retreated. The enemy aircraft dropped seven bombs, none of which caused any damage to us. ㊁ At Xinkai, at 2 p.m., there were enemy cavalry and artillery forces falsely claiming to be more than 2,000, but actually numbering only 500 or 600, who engaged in artillery battles with us for a long time. They were also repelled by us by the evening. ㊂ At 2 p.m., in the area west of Hannuoer Dam, including Huicailiang and Dahonggou, there was a company of enemy mortars, a company of mountain guns, and more than 130 infantry, also falsely claiming to be 1,000, who charged at us. Our defending soldiers were determined and responded calmly, and the enemy did not succeed and retreated. ㊃ In the northwest of Ximalin, there was a large enemy force, whose purpose was to break through our Ximalin positions towards Dahonggou, occupy Chaigoubao, and cut off the connection between Chahar and Suiyuan. Our side is prepared and should have nothing to fear. According to military news, engagements have occurred at various passes along the Great Wall, from Shenweitai in the west to Taizicheng, east of Chicheng County. At around 11 p.m. on the 13th, several hundred enemy soldiers and more than 20 armored vehicles repeatedly launched fierce attacks on our Dahonggou Huicailiang positions on the right side of Shenweitai four times in succession. Our army responded calmly, and they were unable to succeed. Until around early morning on the 14th, the enemy returned with the same forces, but their fierce momentum was also crushed by our army. On the same night, several dozen enemy soldiers and one armored vehicle, also carrying a cannon, invaded our positions at Sanjianfang, northeast of Qingbiankou, but were also repelled. Around Dushikou and Tangzikou, more than 80 enemy soldiers were also discovered on the same night, advancing towards us. Our army launched an attack, and the enemy initially resisted stubbornly but eventually collapsed and fled in disarray. When our army advanced to the Batu Ying area, the enemy hurriedly boarded prepared vehicles and fled. Near Taizicheng, east of our Chicheng County, the enemy increased a regiment, planning to advance on us immediately.

### Arrest of Male and Female Traitors in Wuxi

A Japanese Military Flag Was Found in a Small Fishing Boat; The Situation Is Serious and Has Been Referred to the County Government for Interrogation

Wuxi Dispatch: The Yiyong Zhuang Ding Defense Team of Beita Town, First District of Wuxi, while patrolling outside on the evening of the 25th, saw a suspicious small fishing boat under the river in front of the Chen Shuntai Rice Shop. They boarded the boat to search it and discovered ten wooden chops such as Wang Jiang and Jin Guan, an Autumn Water auspicious black flag, a piece of Japanese women's clothing, a Japanese military flag, and a white towel with the words "Kagoshima Prefecture, Kawauchi Town, Kumanoshiro School District, Anti-Defense Women's Association." They also found a destroyer flag. They immediately interrogated the owner of the fishing boat, who claimed to be named Wang Guixi, from Gaodun, who had been fishing along the Yangtze River in Shanghai. He firmly denied being a traitor. Later, a Japanese copper coin was found on him. Subsequently, 25 yuan in legal tender was found on his wife, Wang Ji, with hidden marks such as "Suzuki" on the legal tender. Considering the seriousness of the situation, they were both taken into custody. On the 26th, they were presented to the district office and then transferred to the county government for interrogation. In addition, the Yiyong Patrol Team of Huihe Town discovered a suspected traitor, Gu Linkang (from Jiangyin), near Wuqiao Tui on the evening of the 26th. Two unfinished pencil drawings of the Weidi were found on him. The drawings resembled the Wuqiao Lixin No. 9 and No. 2 factories. He was handed over to the local police station and transferred to the county for interrogation.

### School Opening Issues in This City

Secondary Schools

The schools of the Shanghai Secondary Schools Association held a meeting at the China Vocational Education Society at 2 p.m. on the 29th, resolving the following: ㊀ To send the association's current affairs committee members to meet with Director Fan of the Social Affairs Bureau to request instructions on the direction of secondary schools during wartime; ㊁ To request the Social Affairs Bureau to assist secondary schools in opening to avoid the suspension of education during wartime; ㊂ To request the Social Affairs Bureau and relief agencies to find a way to relocate all wounded soldiers and refugees residing in various schools by September 10; ㊃ Each school will open independently or jointly with several schools of similar nature and location before September 20; ㊄ The association's mailing address is temporarily set at No. 27, Jingu Village, Jin Shenfu Road.

University Federation

The Shanghai University Federation of this city has now scheduled a meeting of university presidents for 4 p.m. on Wednesday, September 1, at the temporary office of the National Tongji University at No. 29 Difeng Road, to discuss the opening of schools in the autumn semester and to welcome the vice presidents, secretaries-general, and deans of academic affairs of each school to attend.

### Recent Status of Food Supply in Various Places During the Emergency Period

Sufficient Rice Stocks in Wuxi; Various Counties Ordered to Prohibit Rice from Leaving the Area

Wuxi

After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the price of white Xian rice rose nearly to the top due to the smooth procurement of military grain. The County Chamber of Commerce, aware of this situation and fearing that various businesses would release speculative orders, specially gathered leaders of the rice industry to discuss ways to maintain the people's food supply and restrict rice prices. After the regulations, the price of white Geng rice was set at ten yuan and five jiao per dan, and white Xian rice at nine yuan and five jiao, and they were not allowed to raise the price arbitrarily. Currently, the stocks in various piles are abundant, with more than 300,000 dans of Geng rice and more than 100,000 dans of Xian rice, which can be used to supply the new goods. Therefore, people's minds have been softer in recent days, and sellers have also moved. The market is flat, and the lower market is close to the corner, about Xu. On the 21st, the opening price of Fenbai rice was ten yuan and five jiao, rough Geng nine yuan seven jiao to nine yuan, machine-processed rough nine yuan to seven yuan eight jiao, Geng rice five yuan five jiao to five yuan three jiao, Yangxian rice five yuan three jiao to four yuan six jiao, and Ke rice five yuan one jiao to four yuan five jiao. Due to the closure of the flour mills, the new white Geng from Jiangyin has also been put on the market, each quoted at eleven yuan and five jiao.

Changshu

The authorities have long entrusted the Rice Industry Association to prevent grain from leaving the country. Currently, all rice merchants have complied with the order to cease trading with neighboring counties and have decided to send personnel to guard the various sea outlets to intercept any rice boats.

Yangzhou

Wan Yuan Rice Shop in Yiling Town, Zhong Street, Sixth District of Jiangdu, accepted an introduction from Zhou Liangfu, a staff member of Da Shun Pawnshop, and contracted with a certain Tao from the guest (elsewhere) province to unload 40 dans of rice and transport it to Jiangnan. When it was being loaded onto the boat at noon on the 18th, it was discovered by Baozhang Han Shimin, who reported it to the Town Public Office and notified the Water Police Team to detain the rice boat in order to maintain the people's food supply and prevent aiding the enemy. Now, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Xue Guangzu, has ordered the shop to cancel the contract, unload the rice, and register the stored rice within three days when it is purchased, so that the association can prepare for inspection to prevent smuggling.

In addition, villagers in Maqiao Township in the Fourth District and Yantao Dinghuo and other townships in the Seventh District habitually row to the rice-producing areas in Xinghua Gaoyou Lower River in early autumn to purchase rice and transport it back to grind for sale as a sideline occupation during their leisure time from farming. However, this year they all returned empty-handed, saying that rice prices were too high. The price after grinding was twice as high as in this county. When asked about the main reason for the high price of rice, they said that someone was buying it at a high price to transport it to various branches and seaports in Jianfu to sell to enemy merchants at a price of eight or nine yuan per dan, making a substantial profit.

Zhenjiang

The provincial government, considering the current extraordinary period, has made full preparations for the province's food supply. It has immediately issued an order to all counties in the province to prohibit the export of rice and grain. At the same time, it has also begun to investigate the amount of food stored in the province for several months to see if it can meet the needs of the extraordinary period. According to relevant sources, Jiangsu Province has had two years of good harvests, and food reserves are abundant, enough to meet the needs of the extraordinary period.

Wujiang

Dafeng and seven other rice shops in Tongli Town in this county recently loaded 3,390 shi of rice and grain and smuggled it to Shanghai. They were detained by the water police in Anzhuang Town, Qingpu. The Rice Industry Association of this county telegraphed to request their release. County Magistrate Ji of the county sent a telegram to the province for instructions, stating that a large amount of rice and grain was being transported to Shanghai without a passport, and that the matter would be handled after the province approved it.

Xiaoshan

The county's food supply was previously ordered to be fully prepared to prevent urgent needs. Currently, the rice shops in the city and towns are being investigated. In addition to saving as much as possible, all the grain stored in the rural warehouses has been supplied for several months. Soon, the new grain will be harvested, and the rice supply in the four townships is expected to be sufficient. The Chamber of Commerce is still worried that there may not be enough, so it has also purchased a large amount of grain from the Jinlan Shangjiang area to prepare for the accumulation in the urban area. However, the price of rice has been rising again in recent days. The Rice Evaluation Council of this county has specially decided to increase the price of rice by two jiao from the 21st: top white eleven yuan two jiao, second white eleven yuan, and lower grade ten yuan.

Anhui

The Department of Finance, considering that this province is a rice-producing area, should make a special contribution during this extraordinary period to increase military food supplies. It has already issued an order to the local banks, branches, and agencies in the rice-producing areas of the province to follow the rice purchase method established by President Cheng Zhenji of the head office. From the date of the order, they should immediately purchase as much as possible locally of dry rice of the upper and middle colors that can be guaranteed not to produce insects and mold for six months. They should pack it properly in burlap bags and transport it to the provincial capital for transportation to the front lines. All purchase funds and other purchasing expenses should be advanced by the branches and agencies and offset from the head office's account. The local branch has already started large-scale procurement.

### Social Affairs Bureau Announces Temporary Enrollment Measures for Students in War Zones

Students from Unregistered Secondary Schools in War Zones May Also Use These Measures

The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, considering that the war in this city broke out suddenly and that many public and private secondary schools have fallen into the war zone, and that all students attending these schools are affected by the war and transportation is obstructed, making it impossible for many to continue their studies at their original schools as usual, has formulated temporary enrollment measures for students in secondary schools in the war zone in order to facilitate students' access to education and provide relief to those who have dropped out of school. The measures were announced and implemented yesterday. The original text of the measures is recorded below: ㊀ All students of public and registered private secondary schools of all grades who are unable to continue their studies at their original schools due to the war may temporarily enroll in equivalent grades of public or registered private equivalent schools. ㊁ When a public or registered private secondary school receives a student's request to temporarily enroll in another school, it should immediately fill out a temporary enrollment certificate, the form of which is as follows: Temporary Enrollment Certificate (attach student photo) Student □□□, age □, from □ Province □ County, studying in the □ grade of the □ course of the high (middle) school in the □ semester of this school. This semester's grades are passing (failing) and should be promoted (held back). This is to certify that he has requested temporary enrollment.

After the temporary enrollment is completed, the student's temporary enrollment grades will be transferred to the original school, and no documents need to be given to the temporary enrollment student. The student's original school, upon receiving the temporary enrollment grades transferred by the temporary enrollment school after the temporary enrollment student's temporary enrollment period expires, will determine whether to promote, hold back, or graduate the student. ㊄ Public and private secondary schools in this city that intend to accept temporary enrollment students should, in addition to handling matters in accordance with the third item, report the names of the temporary enrollment students, the names of their original schools, and the temporary enrollment grades to this bureau for review within one month after the start of school. ㊅ If a temporary enrollment student wishes to transfer to the school where he is temporarily enrolled, the school where he is temporarily enrolled should strictly examine him. If he is deemed qualified, he may submit the examination results to the competent education authority for approval to change him to a regular student. ㊆ Students from unregistered private secondary schools in the war zone may also use the temporary enrollment measures to temporarily enroll in public and registered private secondary schools. However, the temporary enrollment school, in addition to transferring the temporary enrollment grades to the original school, may not give any documents or request that he be changed to a regular student. ㊇ These measures will be suspended on the day the war ends.
