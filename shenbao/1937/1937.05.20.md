### National Defense Notes (7)

— Our Special Correspondent, Shudi

The Zhengtai Railway passes through Niangzi Pass, and the automobile road passes through Yanmen Pass. In terms of transportation facilities alone, it is not considered inconvenient; however, in the past, due to various political reasons, it was often obstructed. Now, the Tongpu Railway to the south has reached Yangmingbao in the north and Fenglingdu in the south. Once the Yellow River railway bridge is completed, it can be connected to the Longhai Line. After this, as long as there are no other reasons, transportation between Shanxi and the outside will become more frequent and convenient.

However, in the geographical environment of Shanxi, in addition to the natural conditions and transportation situation mentioned above, we should also pay attention to its geographical location. On its north, west, and south sides, the adjacent areas of other provinces are mostly desolate regions, and in terms of economy, there is not much interaction. The area with the most economic interaction with Shanxi is of course the Hebei Province to the east. In the future, the situation will be different. For the sake of consolidating national defense, whether militarily, politically, or economically, it is always necessary to pass through Shanxi and integrate Shanxi. Therefore, future exchanges will inevitably increase.

We have roughly covered the reasons for the geographical environment that separates Shanxi from the outside world. The reporter in Shanxi has also received countless confirmations from people in their own province.

"Why doesn't the mass movement in Shanxi unite with the outside?" I asked, for example.

"That? It's entirely due to geographical reasons, right?"—they would definitely answer like that.

Their meaning seems to focus on the terrain; in fact, within the so-called geographical environment, the political and economic aspects cannot be ignored.

However, all of this is ultimately a more static and superficial factor, which can only answer the question of "Why can't we see its full picture?" Now, we might as well tighten the question a bit: In recent years (especially in the last two years), we have been paying attention to the dynamics of Shanxi; however, even based on the things we have already noticed, why can't we still understand them?

For example, when the Red Army invaded Shanxi from northern Shaanxi between 1935 and 1936, we heard that the Shanxi authorities organized a "Public Justice Corps," and also heard that two slogans were put forward, called: "Sanction bad officials, bad gentry, and bad people," and "Support good officials, good gentry, and good people." But what kind of nature is this group? Are the so-called "bad officials, bad gentry, and bad people" the same as the general concepts of "corrupt officials, evil landlords, and local bullies"? Also, what about the "distribution according to labor" and "property certificates" that were proposed at the same time? Since the outbreak of the Suiyuan War last year, when national defense has been tight, the Shanxi authorities have put forward two slogans, namely: "Embrace the attitude of a weak country and defend the soil to resist the war," and "Break through the scope of the usual and accelerate the strengthening." There is also the "increase the budget method" that was proposed at the same time. What does all this entail? Since the beginning of this year, the great advantage of all aspects of the country has been to engage in the enrichment of material and spiritual national defense work. Therefore, in Shanxi, this year was designated as the "Year of Mass Awakening," and a "Sacrifice to Save the Country Alliance" was organized at the same time, and two slogans were put forward at the same time, namely: "Sacrifice yourself and don't allow others not to sacrifice," and "Don't be a traitor yourself and don't allow others to be a traitor." And as a concrete method of the slogan. "Those with money give money, and everyone contributes." What's going on? In the past two or three years, everyone has learned some of the measures and facilities in Shanxi from occasional reports, and they cannot help but worry, some doubt, and some even find it funny. As a result, everyone is the same: the more they pay attention, the less they understand.

The detailed content of all this will be reported later; here, I plan to first point out what is causing all these factors that are not easily understood by everyone: this is where the unique spirit of Shanxi lies. You can call this unique spirit "creative spirit," or you can call it "integrative spirit," or even "spirit of adapting to the environment." In short, its content is a combination of three aspects: the first aspect is to confirm and accept the new needs of the environment; the second aspect is to value the old traditions and retain them; the third aspect is that because the new and old are not compatible, the method is inevitably to create vigorously.

In recent years, all the measures and facilities in Shanxi can be grasped from these three bases. The examples are countless. Now, we might as well just cite one extremely well-known thing as an example.

When the Red Army invaded Shanxi from Shaanxi, one of the weaknesses they exploited was the poor official system in Shanxi; the Shanxi government immediately confirmed and accepted this shortcoming and the urgent need for improvement, and then put forward the slogan: "Sanction bad officials, bad gentry, and bad people," and "Support good officials, good gentry, and good people." However, how to sanction? How to support? The Shanxi authorities, in the two spirits of the rule of law and the rule of man, focused on the rule of man, so various organizations and various methods were produced with a unique tone. Although there are various other means to sanction "bad officials, bad gentry, and bad people," the method of exposing injustices still uses "criticism," "beating drums," and other methods that we used to see in the past. For the supervision of "good officials, good gentry, and good people," three slogans were also put forward, called: "Being a certain must be like a certain," "Doing something must be diligent," and "Saying something must be true."

As long as we know more about the facts, as long as we analyze a little bit, then we will definitely understand Shanxi, right? —I think.

### Anglo-Japanese Secret Struggle Over Siam (Part 1)

— Te

The Kra Canal Remains the Focus of Attention

Recently, Freeman's book "Will Siam Be the Pivot of Asia?" paid close attention to the possibility that Japan would provide funds to Siam to open the Kra Isthmus canal. Before long, responsible spokespersons declared that such rumors were groundless. However, as long as the Kra Isthmus is excavated, it will promote a large-scale war, so this matter is still a confusing issue, not a baseless fantasy of journalists. This was the impression I (the author of this article, Hese, refers to himself below) got when I visited Phraya Bahol, the powerful Prime Minister of Siam, the hero of several revolutions at the Baruska Fan Palace in Bangkok, to discuss the issue.

According to Phraya Bahol, if the major powers concerned with navigation in that part of the world, forming an international committee, are willing and able to guarantee the permanent neutrality of Siam, then Siam is prepared to cede the area of a neutral canal to the committee. From this point of view, if the environment is favorable, Siam does not seem to regard the opening of the canal as irrational and impractical, but Siam does not want its country to become a battlefield for the Anglo-Japanese war. But on the British side, whether the excavation of the Kra Isthmus into a convenient shipping canal is a rumor or has the possibility of becoming a reality, they always feel uneasy. The canal will pass through the Pakchan River, flow into the Bay of Bengal, cross the narrow Kra Isthmus, and reach the Gulf of Siam. It is of great strategic importance because it will become another gateway from the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean. If Japan once controls this canal, she will be able to threaten the center of the British Empire. But the public may not yet know that the southern end of Burma will become part of the north bank of the canal. The British have built an air station there at Victoria Point, overlooking the western entrance of the canal. The small island of Saint Matthew, which controls the entrance, is a British possession, so the canal is actually within the range of British artillery.

The convenience of the Kra Canal is that it shortens the trade route between Europe and the Far East or between India and the Far East by two to four days. This will obviously ruin the future of Singapore, because Singapore's development depends entirely on its position as the gateway between India and the Pacific. On the other hand, Bangkok or the port of the new canal will leap to become a world-class port, and Siam will be able to open up its hinterland and become a rich and powerful country. In the eyes of the Japanese, the convenience of the Kra Canal is not only shortening the voyage, so that Japanese goods can be transported to the vast market of India at cheaper freight. If Japan provides the funds for the excavation and makes this canal actually become Japan's road, then it also has strategic value.

Before we consider the possible consequences of this plan, we should explain that all rumors originate from misconceptions. People speculate that this project requires huge expenses, and Siam itself is unable to raise the funds and must rely on a powerful country for supply. This view is not correct. Because the Kra Isthmus is only twenty-five miles wide, and there are no mountain rocks in the middle that need to be blasted through with expensive machinery. The canal area is all very soft alluvial soil, and the water levels on both sides of the isthmus are the same, so there is no need to build water gates. In addition, Siamese wages are low, and even people can be forcibly conscripted to perform labor. Therefore, in terms of expenses, Siam is not worried about its financial strength in opening this canal, but relies on foreign aid. As for why it has not started construction so far, the reason is obviously because Britain now controls the western entrance of the future canal, and Siam therefore does not want to offend its strong neighbor.

Siam has long been within the sphere of British influence, and only recently has the situation suddenly changed. Siam's policies were decided by British advisors in the main departments of the government. King Prajadhipok of Siam was an autocratic monarch, and he maintained a firm pro-British attitude, so the British regarded him as the most stable guarantee for maintaining this political situation. In 1932, a violent coup occurred in Siam, changing the autocratic monarchy to a constitutional monarchy, and the friendship between Britain and Siam has since been exposed. Later, several violent coups occurred, and as a result, the Siamese King was uneasy in his position and jumped out of the political vortex and took refuge in Europe. It is still too early to say whether the Constitutional Nationalist Party, which won victory after several revolutions, has anti-British sentiments. But when I recently traveled to Siam, I knew that the Siamese King spent a lot of money every year to pay the salaries of the British advisors in front of him, and the people who bore heavy taxes complained about it. On the one hand, Britain's policy towards Siam was very wrong. When the Siamese King went to England in 1934, it is said that he asked the British government to send two gunboats to escort him back to the country, but the British government refused. In this, Britain lost a final opportunity to tie down Siam, so the Siamese King has been staying abroad and has not returned to his country. Britain's influence in Siam has since plummeted, and Japan has seized the opportunity to take the place of Britain's former leaders. The most important link between Siam and the British Empire, the Singapore Consulate General in Siam, was downgraded to an unimportant consulate in 1934 along with this development. Siam's relationship with Japan has become increasingly close. In March 1935, the Siamese government established new honorary consuls in Kobe and Nagoya. In the spring of 1936, Japan sent a business inspection group to Siam. The head of the ten merchants in the group was Yasukawa, the retired president of Mitsui Corporation. Soon, the Siamese government ordered a batch of railway materials from Mitsui Corporation. Mitsui Corporation has recently built a new building for its branch office in Bangkok. In the past, only three or four Japanese employees were employed in the company, but now it has increased to twenty.

### Talking About the Sino-US Call and the International Relations of the Far East

— Fu

The Sino-US radiotelephone ceremony was held at the International Hotel last night. Participants in the call included President Wang, Minister Que, Madame Chiang, Madame Kung, and US President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull and other important figures. After the success of this call, the two major countries across the Pacific Ocean, although separated by oceans, seemed to be close at hand. This is indeed an amazing achievement in transportation and is of great significance to the promotion of relations between China and the United States.

Although China and the United States are located on the east and west coasts of the Pacific Ocean, their relations have always been very friendly. Recently, due to the development of transportation, the relations between the two countries have become closer. After the formal opening of the Sino-US air route in late last month, the date from China to the United States has been reduced from three weeks to five days. The success of the Sino-US call last night made it possible for the people of the two countries to talk as if they were chatting in the same hall. This makes the relationship between China and the United States and other countries closer. Europeans have always referred to the area of China and Japan as the "Far East." But now, due to scientific progress and the development of transportation, the term "Far East" is no longer very applicable. Therefore, H.H. Tiltman wrote a book called "The Far East Is Not Far" last year, which is what it means.

The reason why the "Far East" has become "not far" is on the one hand due to scientific progress and the development of transportation. But on the other hand, it is also because of the importance of China's position on the international political stage. If China's position is not important, then even if science is very advanced and transportation is extremely developed, no one will pay attention to us. It is only because China has a large land and population and abundant products that it will attract the attention of various countries and apply the latest science to the Far East, so that transportation will become more and more developed. Therefore, today's China is no longer a closed-door China, but a China of the world.

Because China is a China of the world, we cannot underestimate international relations. Especially during this national crisis, we should earnestly support all friendly countries that sympathize with us and forge closer relations with them so that our national liberation movement can be completed as soon as possible. But this does not mean that we can completely rely on friendly countries without cheering ourselves up and working hard. We certainly cannot overestimate ourselves and stick to an isolated policy, ignoring the sympathy given by friendly countries. But we must never completely rely on others and hand over the entire national destiny to others. We must "rely on our own efforts" on the one hand, and also be good at using the international situation. Only with a "two-pronged approach" can the Chinese nation be liberated and become a strong and prosperous country in the Pacific.

### Japan’s Army and Navy Both Strongly Advocate Expanding Armaments

Emphasizing International Situation is Alarming, Promoting Unity and Vigorous Action Between the Military and the People

[Tokyo] The local governors' conference, now in its third day, convened today at the Kudan Military Hall from 1:30 PM. The Army Minister Sugiyama and Navy Minister Yonai, along with their respective Vice Ministers and Bureau Chiefs, as well as all local governors, attended. First, Army Minister Sugiyama gave instructions regarding the current trend of increasing armaments in various countries and the necessity of building a strong national defense. Navy Minister Yonai then spoke about the naval preparedness of the Empire in the first year without treaties, requesting the cooperation of local governors. Next, the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau Chief Kogo elaborated on the Army's views on strengthening national defense and reforming administrative affairs, and reported on the domestic and international situation. Following this, the Navy Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau Chief Toyoda reported on the naval trends of various countries, as well as the Empire's naval preparedness and determination in the era without treaties. After various earnest discussions, the meeting adjourned.

Army Minister Sugiyama stated in his speech that the current international situation tends to become increasingly critical. Although there were some anti-government elements acting in the Soviet Union in the past, the power of the state was not affected in any way, and the foundation remains solid. With the progress of the second five-year plan, war preparations have shown a major leap forward. Especially the expansion of military preparations in the Far East, such as the expansion of air force strength, the completion of the double-tracking of the Trans-Siberian Railway, and the advancement of the establishment of industrial zones for military needs in the Far East, make one feel that its positive intentions towards the Far East are not comparable to ordinary ones. On the other hand, looking at the trends in China, as a result of striving for a centralized government based on the "anti-Japanese banner," the substantial strengthening of armaments, and the construction of national defense projects, there is even an overconfidence in their national strength. Regarding the domestic situation in our country, whether in spirit or in material, there are points that make me and all of you feel worried, which is truly regrettable. In such a pressing domestic and international situation, in order to prevent national disasters before they happen and to ensure the eternal peace and prosperity of East Asia with Japan and Manchuria as the core, and to realize the ideals of our founding, we must, based on a proper understanding of the situation, unite from top to bottom, with the military and the people as one, overcome all difficulties, and make the comprehensive strength of the country leap forward, so as to eliminate the crises of the surrounding neighbors and promote the inevitable progress of internal reform. What I earnestly hope from all of you is to deeply understand the above-mentioned situation and make the best efforts. In addition, the Army Minister also sought the consideration and efforts of the local governors regarding the call-up of troops, the improvement of minor affairs, the improvement of the physical strength of young adults, and the encouragement of army second lieutenant candidates and volunteers.

Navy Minister Yonai said in his speech that, starting this year, the Empire has finally broken free from the unequal naval armaments limitation treaties. From now on, the Empire has removed the stigma of "naval power inferior to Europe and America" from the past, and has the freedom to develop naval armaments suitable to the national situation. From another perspective, this means that the Empire has reached an equal footing with Britain and the United States, which is of the utmost importance to the nation. As for whether this position can be secured and the Empire's mission can be accomplished, it all depends on the awareness and efforts of the people. Under the current situation where the surrounding environment does not allow for optimism, if our country slacks off in the strengthening of naval armaments for even one day, not only will the glorious imperial position be lost, but the so-called stabilizing force of East Asia will also be nominal and without substance, and the great cause of nurturing the State of Manchuria will not be achieved. However, even in the era without treaties, the Empire will naturally avoid unnecessary naval armaments competition. But the armament buildup necessary to fulfill the Empire's mission, even if it entails hardship, must be achieved. (Nineteenth day, Allied News Agency dispatch)

### Chinese Director of the London China Society Expresses Opinions on the Far Eastern Situation

Japan's Policies Towards China Endanger Britain's Commercial Position

[London] Zhang Shuli (transliteration), the Chinese director of the London China Society, published his opinion on the Far Eastern situation in The Times today, stating that Britain's commercial position in the Far East depends on the fate of the existence of the Chinese nation, and not on the future of Japan. This is because the policies adopted by Japan are gradually conquering China, reducing all commercial privileges of friendly nations in the Far East. Moreover, what is currently threatened is not only the opportunities of merchants, but whether they will be able to trade in China in the future. Therefore, the integrity of Chinese territory and its complete political and economic control is the only way to maintain British interests in China. And besides this, there is no other way between Britain and Japan to stabilize international relations in Asia or to provide more solid protection for American interests. (Central News Agency, nineteenth day, Reuters dispatch)

### The Success or Failure of the Pacific Cooperation Plan Depends on Japan

The Sino-Japanese Problem is Not Easily Solved, a Round Table Conference is Difficult to Achieve

[London] The Times today published an editorial criticizing the proposal by Australian Prime Minister Lyons for Pacific nations to conclude a non-aggression pact. It stated that since the Washington Treaty has expired, a new foundation for international relations in the Pacific must be sought. If possible, a stronger foundation should be sought. This situation is very clear. However, the success or failure of any plan along this line will largely depend on the spirit with which Japan is prepared to cooperate. In this regard, the current omens are very good. Japanese Foreign Minister Sato's speech to local governors on May 17 was mild in tone and reiterated the argument of friendship with Britain. This argument has been repeated in Tokyo recently, and London has repeatedly welcomed it. China is an important party with the most stake in it. If its rights and responsibilities as a sovereign nation are fully recognized, then China should not have any reason to be unwilling to participate. To make the organization of a non-aggression pact fully thorough, it seems indispensable to include the Soviet Union. However, for China, Russia, and Japan to hold a round table conference in a friendly neighborly manner, this matter does not seem to be something that can be spoken of today, but it cannot be concluded that it will never be possible. The factor that has a decisive force in the conspicuous solution of the Far Eastern question, as Japanese politicians have gradually prepared to acknowledge recently, is the nature of the relationship between the two major neighbors in the East. In short, it is Japan's goals in and for China. British and American public opinion is the same on this point. This is a sharp test. Although emotions are very powerful, this is not only an emotional event, because in reality, one cannot consider a system such as that proposed by Lyons unless there is a restoration of mutual trust between China and Japan. (Central News Agency, nineteenth day, Reuters dispatch)

[London] Australian Federal Prime Minister Lyons recently proposed at the British Imperial Conference that countries along the Pacific coast conclude a non-aggression pact, in other words, a kind of Pacific Locarno Pact. Observers here have commented that, given the current situation, such a convention is unlikely to be practical. There are two reasons: first, the United States will not agree to this plan until the issue of naval balance of power and the fortification of Pacific islands (according to Article 19 of the Washington Naval Treaty, Britain, the United States, and Japan shall maintain the status quo of the defensive works and existing naval bases on the islands in the Pacific Ocean belonging to their respective countries, and shall not add any more. The British government suggested to the United States and Japan in October of last year to conduct negotiations to extend the above article, but this matter has not yet been resolved) has been resolved; second, unless the major issues in the Pacific are resolved, it will be difficult for Britain, Japan, the United States, Australia, Russia, France, the Netherlands, and other countries with interests in the Pacific to reach a complete understanding. Among the so-called major issues in the Pacific, the trade competition between Britain and Japan and the Sino-Japanese problem are particularly thorny. Among them, the resolution of the latter problem is especially difficult, because Japan clearly opposes any mediation by other countries in the Sino-Japanese dispute. Since mediation by other countries is impossible, and it is so difficult for China and Japan and Japan and Russia to resolve their issues directly, is it possible to convene a round table conference of Pacific countries to resolve Pacific issues? This is even more doubtful. (Central News Agency, eighteenth day, Havas dispatch)

### The Japanese Political and Constitutional Parties' Movement to Overthrow the Cabinet

Jointly Issue a Declaration, Pointing Out the Lin Cabinet's Misgovernment

[Tokyo] The joint council of members of the Japanese Seiyukai and Minseito parties, with ten members from each party, held its first meeting at the Imperial Hotel this afternoon. Thus, the flames of the movement to overthrow the Lin cabinet by the two political parties have become increasingly fierce. The meeting passed three important resolutions: (1) to hold a joint rally for the two parties' movement to overthrow the cabinet on May 28, which all members of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives belonging to the two parties, as well as the leaders of the branches of the two parties in each district, must attend and participate in; (2) to establish a headquarters for overthrowing the cabinet in Tokyo; (3) to organize a cabinet overthrow committee. After the meeting, a joint declaration was issued, pointing out that the Lin cabinet disregards public opinion, tramples on public opinion, and has errors and selfishness in handling national affairs. The declaration also asserted that they cannot allow the Lin cabinet to exist for even one more day, and demanded the formation of a national unity cabinet. At the same time, a joint anti-Lin cabinet association organized by members of the House of Peers a few days ago also held a meeting today, deciding to issue a warning to the Prime Minister and expressing opposition to Lin's clinging to power. Prime Minister Lin, in view of the seriousness of the situation, after today's cabinet meeting, asked Agriculture Minister Yamazaki Tatsunosuke and Justice Minister Shiono Kihiko to stay behind temporarily, awaiting Finance Minister Yuki Toyotaro's return after reporting on financial affairs in the House of Representatives before holding a meeting. The four ministers then held a secret meeting for half an hour to discuss countermeasures, and as a result, they reached the conclusion that the government currently insists on its established policies and still holds power, awaiting the clear confirmation of the atmosphere in the House of Representatives after the convening of a special session of parliament, and that there is no other way to follow. It is rumored that during today's cabinet meeting, there was a discussion about the selection of full-time candidates for the ministries of education, railways, and colonial affairs, but because of differences of opinion among the cabinet members, the filling of the vacancies in the three ministries has, in fact, been abandoned. The Lin cabinet is suffering from fierce opposition from the outside, and internal disagreements, making it difficult to imagine the fate of the cabinet.

### Roosevelt's Judicial Reform Plan Rejected by Senate Committee

A Stalwart of the Conservative Faction in the Supreme Court Retires, Future Developments of this Case Attract Attention from All Parties

[Washington] The Senate Judiciary Committee today rejected President Roosevelt's federal judicial reform plan by a vote of 10 to 8. Yesterday, progressive Democratic Senator Wheeler said that ten members of the Judiciary Committee would vote against it, and today it was as he said. Wheeler also said that there are at least 50 votes against the bill in the Senate, which remains to be proven by the facts. Now that the Judiciary Committee has made this resolution, the President's proposal will either be greatly modified to seek a compromise, or it will be rejected in the Senate arena. At the same time, the public is also paying close attention to the sudden announcement of the retirement of Supreme Court Justice Van Devanter yesterday. For many years, Van Devanter has been a stalwart of the conservative faction in the Supreme Court and had long harbored the intention of retiring. However, because "New Deal" cases were coming one after another, he hesitated. In thirteen New Deal cases, Van Devanter took a position opposing the government in all of them. It is said that although Van Devanter is leaving the Supreme Court, he may still be appointed as a federal circuit judge according to law. After President Roosevelt received Van Devanter's letter of resignation, he immediately invited Van Devanter to meet. It is said that the President believes that Van Devanter's resignation indicates that his position has won one-sixth of the victory. Chief Justice Hughes of the Supreme Court expressed deep respect for Van Devanter. Other conservative justices, Sutherland and McReynolds, said that Van Devanter's resignation was a major loss to the court. Senator Wheeler believed that since Van Devanter had resigned, the President should withdraw his proposal. The President did not want to answer this point, but said that the issue of who will succeed him has not yet been decided. If the President appoints a liberal, then the balance between the old and new factions in the court for the past seven years will be broken. (Nineteenth day, National Telegram)

[Washington] The committee discussed this case for two hours. Various amendments and compromises, except for the amendment proposed by McCarran to permanently increase the number of Supreme Court justices to eleven, and other unimportant proposals, were all rejected. After the majority of opposing members and the minority of supporting members of the Judiciary Committee each provide their reports, this case will be submitted to the Senate in early June for debate. According to observers, unless the authorities take unexpected actions, the debate in the Senate will be merely a formality. (Central News Agency, eighteenth day, Reuters dispatch)

[Washington] Supreme Court Justice Van Devanter, who is 78 years old, has recently notified President Roosevelt that he will retire on June 2. According to President Roosevelt's bill to reform the Supreme Court, which he submitted to Congress a few days ago, Supreme Court justices over the age of 70 may be ordered to retire and new justices appointed. This bill is currently being reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee and will be put to a vote. Van Devanter's decision to retire at this time is noteworthy. According to Roosevelt's proposed bill, in addition to Van Devanter, there are five other Supreme Court justices who should retire because they are over the age of 70. One is Chief Justice Hughes, and the other four are Sutherland, McReynolds, Brandeis, and Butler. Van Devanter was appointed as a Supreme Court Justice by the late President Taft in 1910, serving for 26 years. In the Supreme Court, he is a justice who tends to the conservative faction. When the court ruled on President Roosevelt's various social reform bills, Van Devanter voted against them 12 times out of 13. The last time was against the Wagner Act.

Norfolk, Virginia, USA. The Foreign Trade Association is holding a China-US Trade Week here today. Mo, the Director of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, attended the speech, predicting that China will continue to purchase large quantities of goods and machinery from Europe and the United States to develop domestic construction, such as building railways, highways, airlines, opening electrical plants, textile factories, and mining, etc. If the environment permits, it will develop according to normal routes. In the years after this, China may become a major market for commerce and capital of European and American countries. China's own capital is also trusting the government for the first time in many years, and has been successively circulating in the market. As for the US trade with Japan, there is no hope for major development, because the development of Japanese industry is limited. (Eighteenth day, National Telegram)

### Britain, France, and Russia Form a Coordination to Maintain the Balance of Power in Central Europe

Preventing the Expansion of Italian and German Influence, Current Borders are Not to be Broken

[Paris] Britain, France, and Russia have today verbally agreed to jointly maintain the balance of power in Central Europe. It is understood that this coordination was formed entirely in preparation for Italy and Germany concluding a military alliance. The representatives of the three countries held a meeting in London at the time of the coronation of the British King, and decided on the policies that should be taken. Finally, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, French Prime Minister Blum, and Foreign Minister Delbos formed a verbal agreement here. Since German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini have intended to expand their influence in the Danube region, Britain, France, and Russia have advocated that the Central European relations created by the Treaty of Versailles should not be broken geographically, politically, or morally. France and Russia have agreed that the Franco-Russian alliance must strive to maintain it, and Britain also agrees that the German-Italian axis will be dangerous if not stopped. If another Locarno Treaty is concluded, France insists that it must not conflict with the Franco-Russian alliance, and must guarantee the independence of Eastern European countries, no different from Western European countries. The above-mentioned coordination is the result of the first conversation. Delbos still needs to talk to Belgian Prime Minister Janson, Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt, and Yugoslav Regent Prince Paul. France and Russia have agreed to maintain all existing treaties and support efforts to improve the Central European economy. It is said that the attitudes of the two countries are in line with the claims of the Church, Britain, and President Roosevelt. A French spokesperson claimed today that Britain and France have agreed on a plan to grant Central European countries "most-favored-nation" treatment, and that Britain's willingness to make economic concessions is due to its knowledge that President Roosevelt also supports this move in order to improve the world political situation. Observers believe that the new policies of Britain and France are a response to Austria's plea for help from other countries to resist German oppression.

### France and Russia Unswervingly Adhere to the Obligations of the Mutual Assistance Pact

Safeguarding Peace within the League of Nations Framework, Public Statement Issued After Talks in Paris

[Paris] Prime Minister Blum met with Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov this afternoon for talks. Foreign Minister Delbos was also present at the time. Afterwards, a public statement was issued, saying only that "the policies pursued by France and Russia are both aimed at maintaining overall peace and a collective security system. The two countries will also adhere to the mutual assistance pact concluded by the two countries within the framework of the League of Nations without wavering. The outcome of the talks has already clarified this point, and the authorities of the two countries are therefore very pleased." (Central News Agency, eighteenth day, Havas dispatch)

[Paris] France and the Soviet Union have now begun to seek new diplomatic ways to reconcile the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Agreement with the recently proposed New Locarno Treaty. French Foreign Minister Delbos and Foreign Commissioner Litvinov had lunch together today. Delbos reiterated that the French government has no intention of abandoning the Franco-Soviet Agreement, but in order to reduce Germany's resistance to joining the Western European Security Pact, the French government intends to appropriately restrict the Franco-Soviet Agreement. Officials here also stated that the Franco-Soviet Agreement was originally intended to create an "Eastern Locarno Pact." Hitler had been invited to join, but Germany believed that the agreement was an encirclement operation against Germany and insisted that if the agreement continued to exist, it would also refuse to join the new Western Locarno Pact. Therefore, the French government has a plan to find another way to break the deadlock. (Central News Agency, eighteenth day, Reuters dispatch)

[Paris] After French Prime Minister Blum and Foreign Minister Delbos held talks with Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov yesterday, they issued a public statement, stating that France and the Soviet Union should still adhere to the mutual assistance pact. The newspapers here therefore expressed satisfaction. The Petit Parisien reported, "This agreement is clear in its wording. It shows that the so-called comments by some Soviet commentators that the relationship between France and the Soviet Union is no longer as close as before are completely unfounded. Although the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact is durable, there is still room for other agreements to be compatible with it, especially the Western European Pact currently under discussion." L'Ordre reported, "This public statement, from any perspective, can be considered satisfactory. The political talks recently held in London seem to have confirmed the theory that peace is an indivisible whole, and the collective security system and the League of Nations Covenant will still be the basis of the diplomatic policies of various democratic countries." Paris Soir reported, "What position does the Soviet Union occupy in the international situation? This country has adopted a free and neutral policy, and Yugoslavia and Romania also have a tendency to waver. Therefore, the position of the Soviet Union in the international arena is becoming more important. The British and French must have the same feeling. Therefore, the negotiations conducted by Delbos and Litvinov are mutually related to the talks conducted by Delbos and Chamberlain (future British Prime Minister) in London."

### Austrian Foreign Minister Visits Paris in Return

[Paris] Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt, who represented his government at the coronation ceremony of the British King, has arrived here from London. (Central News Agency, eighteenth day, Havas dispatch)

[Paris] Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt arrived here today and will discuss with French Foreign Minister Delbos tomorrow the issue of France's guarantee to Austria if Austria's independence is threatened. It is also understood that during his stay here, Yugoslav Regent Prince Paul will also discuss the Austrian issue. (Eighteenth day, National Hai Tong Telegram)

[Paris] The Parisian newspapers, due to the arrival of the Austrian Foreign Minister, have cited the Central European issue and the Danube River basin issue as the subject of their comments. Le Petit Parisien stated that Austria is now increasingly feeling the need for good neighborly relations, so its relations with Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Yugoslavia have improved more than before. Le Matin stated that the purpose of the Austrian Foreign Minister's visit to France is to obtain France's guarantee. Paris Soir stated that Austria's closer cooperation with Hungary and Czechoslovakia is aimed at organizing an "anti-German" united front. Le Petit Journal stated that Schmidt's visit to France is to explain Austria's political and economic situation and explain Hodza's proposal. (Nineteenth day, National Hai Tong Telegram)

The Italian King plans to stay for four days and will participate in various welcome ceremonies, the most important of which is the army grand review tomorrow.

### Anglo-German Relations Gradually Approaching

The Outcome of Blomberg's Visit to England: Formal Negotiations Not Yet Timely

[London] After General Blomberg, the German Minister of Defense, came here to celebrate the King's coronation, he held talks with Prime Minister Baldwin and Foreign Secretary Eden. Consequently, there were external rumors that England and Germany might begin formal talks as soon as possible. Recently, according to sources from both England and Germany, the British authorities have no intention of starting negotiations with Germany immediately. Moreover, England and Germany hold quite different views regarding the nature of the negotiations. It is reported that General Blomberg mentioned the issue of Germany recovering its former colonies. The British authorities believe that this issue should be resolved in conjunction with various European issues and should not be handled separately. It is also reported that General Blomberg also mentioned the Spanish issue. Regarding this matter, after talking with Blomberg, the British authorities felt that Germany had decided not to interfere further in the Spanish Civil War and would recall some of the troops currently fighting in Spain. Britain firmly believes that mediation by various countries in the Spanish Civil War is necessary. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 18th)

Eden's Speech on the International Crisis: Stresses the Necessity of Reorganizing Armaments

[London] The British Imperial Conference, with the chief representatives of the United Kingdom and its dominions and colonies, is scheduled to hold a meeting at 5:00 PM today to discuss foreign policy issues. At that time, British Foreign Secretary Eden will deliver an important speech. Regarding this matter, British officials recently stated that the Foreign Secretary will point out the crisis of the international situation and the necessity of reorganizing armaments, and will firmly advocate that economic issues should be discussed only after various political issues have been resolved. The so-called international crisis mainly includes the following: 1) The situation in Spain; 2) The situation in the Mediterranean and Italy's ambitions; 3) Germany's demands regarding the recovery of its former colonies; 4) The situation in Central Europe, especially the relationship between Austria and Czechoslovakia; 5) The Pacific issue, where opinions will be expressed on the non-aggression pact proposed by Australian Prime Minister Lyons. Furthermore, this meeting is of a confidential nature, and the Foreign Secretary's speech will not be released. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 19th)

### Economic and Constitutional Issues Begin Group Discussions

[London] Since yesterday, the British Imperial Conference has entered a serious discussion period on commercial navigation, economic, and constitutional issues. Regarding the discussion of constitutional issues, it was resolved to organize a committee specializing in the discussion of various constitutional issues, with particular emphasis on the formulation of nationality laws. Currently, Canada, South Africa, and Southern Ireland have all promulgated relevant laws and regulations on this matter. As for the selection of members for the Constitutional Issues Discussion Committee, a meeting of the heads of delegations will be held at 10 Downing Street this afternoon to discuss diplomatic and defense issues, at which time a decision can be made. Commercial navigation issues are of great importance to the future of the Imperial Federation. Therefore, the Commercial Navigation Subcommittee expressed some initial views during its first meeting yesterday. However, the date of the second meeting has not yet been decided. It is expected that a wide-ranging discussion of the issue will precede the convening of the second meeting. Issues such as discrimination against national flags and national subsidies for commercial navigation in the Pacific and other regions will be discussed. The report of the previous Imperial Commercial Navigation Committee will also be re-examined, and it has been decided to adopt relevant data for reference by the delegations. Furthermore, the Economic Issues Committee also held a meeting yesterday, which was largely exploratory in nature. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 19th)

[London] The Economic Committee of the British Imperial Conference held a meeting today and began discussing the tariff policy of the British Empire and the issue of tariff reductions proposed by the United States. It is reported that during today's meeting, the British government maintained its original stance, stating that it is inappropriate to re-discuss the imperial reciprocal tariff system decided at the Ottawa Imperial Conference in 1933 at this time. However, some representatives of the autonomous colonies insisted that the issue of the Ottawa Imperial Tariff System should be thoroughly discussed in the Economic Committee. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 18th)

[London] The Imperial Conference established a special committee this morning to study various constitutional issues. This committee includes the chief representatives of the United Kingdom and its autonomous colonies, as well as several legal experts. The citizenship issue of citizens of the autonomous colonies is often one of the committee's research objectives. It is found that Canadian citizens currently enjoy dual citizenship. On the one hand, they are Canadian citizens, and on the other hand, they are protected by British consuls and British naval and land forces everywhere. It is reported that South African Prime Minister Hertzog proposed that this dual citizenship system should be promoted, and that all subjects under the rule of the British King, regardless of whether they are people of the autonomous colonies or colonies, should enjoy it equally. However, it is expected that the British government will submit a counter-proposal, arguing that if the people of the autonomous colonies want to be treated as British citizens and protected by the United States around the world, the amount of expenses borne by the autonomous colonies for British military expenditures and other expenses should be increased, and should not be borne mostly by the people of the British mainland.

### Postmaster General Explains Air Transport Development Plan

[London] Postmaster General Tryon hosted a banquet today on behalf of the government for the representatives attending the Imperial Conference and various personnel from overseas government agencies. Tryon mentioned imperial transportation, saying that according to the Imperial Air Mail Plan, new airships specially built for the Imperial sky routes will create a new era of development in the postal transportation business. The principle of British policy is that air transport must be regarded as a common form of transportation, not as a special one. In terms of postage, first-class mail sent from the United Kingdom will be charged three and a half pence per half ounce for ordinary letters, and one penny for postcards. In terms of time, air transport will be faster in the future than it is now, and its speed will increase with time. Air services in South Africa and East Africa can begin in about a month, and services to India and Malaya can be opened by the end of this year. He hopes that it can be extended to Australia by the beginning of next year. As for telephotography, the distance that can currently be reached is often around twenty-five miles, but one day it will be able to reach other parts of the empire.

### British Prime Minister Urges Young People

Protecting Democratic Governance Should Be Regarded as a Sacred Duty

[London] Today, British Prime Minister Baldwin addressed the Imperial Youth at Albert Hall, stating that in the next twenty-five years, the biggest problem in the world will be the issue of government. Therefore, young people should be interested in government and should regard protecting democratic politics as their sacred duty from the inside out. In some countries, the freedom of the individual has been almost completely stripped away, and Europe has re-entered a state of armed alert. Baldwin added, "The theory of monarchical theocracy is a thing of the past. We do not want to establish a national theocracy to replace it, because no nation is worthy of the worship of a free man." Baldwin did not say, "The path of human fraternity is often ridiculed, but the world will never have peace until human fraternity is recognized as unswerving wisdom."

### The British King is Scheduled to Review the Navy Today

### England and Turkey in Talks

Both Sides Agree on Cooperation for Peace in the Near East

[London] Turkish Prime Minister İsmet İnönü continued to hold lengthy talks with Eden today, discovering that England and Turkey agreed on most issues. However, it is pointed out here that this talk is not a formal negotiation, but merely an exchange of opinions on various important issues. It is also stated that both sides were satisfied with the results of the talks. The true nature of the talks is being kept silent. The "Star" reported that the maintenance of peace in the Mediterranean and the Near East, and the possibility of Italian aggression, were the themes of the talks. The newspaper said that England and Turkey were well aware that the British and Turkish interests in the region were complementary. Britain maintains a strong military force in the eastern Mediterranean, and Turkey's wartime military strength is also 1,000,000 men. In times of emergency, Turkish troops can serve as reinforcements for the British army in Egypt and Palestine, and the British Navy can dock in Turkish seaports.

### Calling on Both Sides of the Spanish War to Abolish Sky Bombing

The Non-Intervention Committee Has Passed It

[London] The Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Committee has now decided to request that both sides of the Spanish war abolish aerial bombing and adopt other humanitarian methods of warfare. At the same time, regarding other aspects of control, such as the use of the Spanish government's overseas deposits and people from treaty countries of non-intervention going to Spain to prolong and worsen the Spanish war, considerable intensified management trial methods have been put in place. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 19th)

[London] At a meeting of the subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee today, the Italian representative did not express any objection to the suggestion of advising both parties in the Spanish Civil War not to bomb undefended cities, which was beyond the expectations of the general public. Generally, the reasons for Italy adopting this compromising stance are nothing more than the following two points: first, the German delegation telegraphed to advise the Italian representative to adopt a compromising stance within the Adjustment Committee; second, the representatives of other countries have mostly agreed to submit for discussion the issue of prohibiting foreign propaganda personnel from entering Spain, so Italy's attitude has softened accordingly.

### New Prime Minister of Spain's Policy Declaration

Unified Military Command, Controlled Economic Life

Basque Region Supports New Cabinet⦿Valencia The new Prime Minister of Spain, Negrín, declared today that the special mission of the new government today is to "unify the command of military actions and control economic life." They expressed regret for the non-existence of trade union organizations. It is heard that the formation of this new cabinet has a tendency to turn to the right, and the Basques are particularly satisfied with it, because the Basques occupy three seats in the new cabinet. The Basques now feel that Valencia has realized the importance of defending Bilbao. Furthermore, the new cabinet maintains the Popular Front as before.

Regarding the war situation, the Nationalist army is attacking Amorebieta with all its strength. Yesterday, it was fiercely bombed by airplanes and artillery all day long. The flight team also dropped many bombs and incendiary bombs, completely destroying the city. Because the heights outside the city have been occupied by the Nationalist army, the government army cannot hold it to the death and has withdrawn from the city, but morale is high.

### Hungary Demands Military Equality

Italy Strongly Supports

Budapest The semi-official Italian agency, the Stefani News Agency, recently expressed its opinion on the issue of Hungary's rearmament, stating briefly, "Hungary's declaration stating the restoration of equal rights to armaments has long been expected by the general public. Now that Germany and Austria have both rearmed, and other countries are competing to reorganize and strengthen their armies regardless of Article 8 of the League of Nations Covenant on reducing armaments, under these circumstances, it is unreasonable to only ask Hungary to abide by the one-sided provisions contained in the European War Peace Treaty. Based on our guess, Hungary's defense has long been fully established, so the country's demand for rearmament is only of a spiritual and legal nature. Italian public opinion now believes that recognizing Hungary's equal rights is a necessary condition for creating a favorable environment for the peaceful cooperation of European countries." People generally believe that observing the expression of this opinion by the Stefani News Agency reveals that Hungary will take decisive steps on the matter of rearmament. Some quarters even believe that although Hungary has not explicitly declared the abolition of the European War Treaty with Hungary, it has in fact already reorganized its armaments. After Italian King Emmanuel III arrives here, the Hungarian government will hold a grand military parade on the 20th of this month to welcome him. This military parade will probably be a public display of Hungary's reorganization of armaments. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 18th)

### Inauguration Ceremony of Sino-American Wireless Telephone Held Last Night

Speech by Minister of Communications Yu Feipeng, attended by Acting President Wang, American Ambassador, and others

The Sino-American Wireless Telephone held a grand opening ceremony at the International Hotel on the second floor last night at 9:30 PM. Minister of Communications Yu Feipeng and Vice Minister Peng Xuepei personally presided over the event, which was a grand occasion. The details are recorded as follows:

Venue Arrangement

Arranged jointly by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, International Radio Station, and Broadcasting Station in recent days, the venue was magnificent and solemn, with everything needed. The national flags of China and the United States, the portraits of Sun Yat-sen and President Washington, and the portraits of Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, and President Roosevelt were hung in front of the venue, along with the Buddha-character logo of the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications. The national flags of various countries were hung on the top, and the walls were decorated with fresh flowers and colored lights. There were beautifully crafted Sino-American wireless towers made of candy and other exquisite items in the venue, too numerous to mention. The engineering and art showcased had profound significance. By about 9 PM,

Chinese and Foreign Guests

More than a thousand guests arrived in succession, including Acting President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Chonghui, American Ambassador to China Johnson, Madam Chiang Kai-shek Soong Mei-ling, Madam Kung Hsiang-hsi Soong Ai-ling, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council Soong Tzu-wen, Acting Mayor of Shanghai Yu Hongjun, American Consul in Shanghai Gauss, and leaders from diplomatic, financial, commercial, and engineering circles from China and the West, all accompanied by their wives, arrived at the venue one after another. Minister Yu, Vice Minister Peng, directors, section chiefs of the Ministry of Communications, and directors and engineers from the Shanghai telecommunications bureaus warmly received them and provided refreshments. At about 10 PM,

Minister's Speech

Minister Yu delivered an opening speech, saying, "Today is the opening ceremony of the Sino-American Wireless Telephone. I am extremely grateful and honored to have Acting President Wang, American Ambassador Johnson, Madam Chiang, Madam Kung, Mr. Soong Tzu-wen, Acting Mayor Yu of Shanghai, and all distinguished guests attend. Scientific progress is constantly advancing. Five years before the founding of the Republic of China (1906 AD), China and the United States first communicated using undersea cables through the Pacific Waterline Telegraph Company. At that time, it was already considered swift. In 1929 AD (18th year of the Republic of China), the Shanghai International Radio Station was established, using wireless radio to communicate with Manila. The following year, it communicated directly with San Francisco. Everyone was amazed by this remarkable progress. However, conveying meaning through text is ultimately not as convenient as language. With wireless telephone, people can talk to each other, exchange opinions immediately, without any barriers, saving a lot of time. It is truly a powerful tool for modern communication. The Ministry of Communications, in response to the needs of the times, after three years of preparation, the Sino-American wireless telephone communication has finally come to fruition today. I am deeply gratified. The Sino-American wireless telephone was originally scheduled for twice a day, day and night. However, because the nighttime trial communication results were very good, we will first open nighttime communication and continue to test to achieve daytime communication. From now on, the people of China and the United States, separated by vast oceans, can talk directly, as if meeting in the same room. This will not only provide convenience and comfort to overseas Chinese in both countries, but also facilitate communication for political, commercial, and cultural undertakings. I firmly believe that the diplomatic relations between the two countries will become closer from now on. This is the significance of my joy today. Therefore, I would like to offer a toast to everyone and wish you all good health." Subsequently, Director Bao of the Telegraph Bureau translated it into English and conveyed it to the foreign guests. Then, American Ambassador to China Johnson delivered a speech, using the Sino-American Wireless Telephone as an example, elaborating on the friendly relations between China and the United States in great detail.

Communication Ceremony

First, Director of the Telecommunications Department Wen Yuqing delivered a speech introducing the ceremony. Then, (1) Acting President Wang spoke with American Secretary of State Hull, (2, 3) Madam Chiang and Madam Kung spoke with First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, (4) Minister Yu spoke with Chairman of the U.S. Communications Commission, Bullitt, (5) American Secretary of State Hull spoke with American Ambassador to China Johnson, (6, 7) Acting President Wang and Mr. Soong spoke with Chinese Ambassador to the United States Shi Zhaoji, (8) Madam Kung spoke with the wife of Chinese Ambassador to the United States Shi Zhaoji, (9) Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Division of the U.S. State Department Hornbeck spoke with American Consul General in Shanghai Gauss, (10) Acting Mayor Yu spoke with Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Division of the U.S. State Department Hornbeck, (11) Vice Minister Peng spoke with Vice Chairman Miller of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. The speeches and the communication process between China and the United States were broadcast throughout the venue by loudspeakers and broadcast by the Ministry of Communications Broadcasting Station. The accuracy of the transmission and the clarity of the sound waves were praised and appreciated by everyone inside and outside the bureau.

Compilation of Congratulatory Messages

Acting President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Chonghui's message to American Secretary of State Hull: "Mr. Hull, it is an honor to exchange greetings with you on the wireless telephone today. The Sino-American aviation across the Pacific Ocean began just three weeks ago. From now on, what used to take weeks or months for ocean transportation will only take a few days. Modern science is flourishing, and now we have wireless telephone communication. Today, at the opening ceremony of Sino-American communication, people from China and the United States will not only be able to exchange goods and culture, but also engage in direct conversations. Confucius said, 'Within the four seas, all are brothers.' The universal love of our Chinese nation, with the help of this communication, will surely leave a deeper impression on the people of the world. As I just said, scientific development has shrunk the earth, and the relationship between countries is becoming increasingly close. I hope that in the future, ideas on race, religion, and politics will merge like a family. The friendly relations between China and the United States have always been harmonious. With this wireless telephone, the friendship between the two countries will definitely be further enhanced." American Secretary of State Hull's congratulatory message to Acting President Wang of the Executive Yuan of China: "Minister Wang, today our two countries are holding the opening ceremony of wireless telephone communication. Both Your Excellency and I are delighted to be part of this grand occasion. I would like to take this opportunity to extend my congratulations to Your Excellency. The communication between our two countries began in 1784 when a small boat carrying goods sailed to your country for the first time. The voyage from New York to Guangzhou took six months. At that time, the communication between our two countries relied solely on sailing ships. Recently, due to the flourishing of science and the rapid advancement of equipment, communication has developed accordingly. The exchange of goods, culture, and even language between countries, even across oceans, is no longer a concern. The progress of science has ultimately reduced the distance in the world, and countries, even if they are located in remote areas, can approach each other like neighbors. Today, Your Excellency and I, located on opposite sides of the two hemispheres, exchange congratulatory messages as if we were in the same city and talking to each other by telephone. The opening of wireless telephone between our two countries today marks a new era in communication between the two countries. I firmly believe that it will enhance the friendship between the people of the two countries and bring benefits to both of our countries." (2) Minister Yu of the Ministry of Communications' message to the Chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, translated: "To His Excellency Chairman Bullitt of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, on the occasion of the opening ceremony of the Sino-American Wireless Telephone, I extend my congratulations to Your Excellency and all members. When I visited your country two years ago, I was deeply impressed by the development of your country's communication industry. Under the guidance of Chairman Chiang in recent years, China has also made considerable progress in domestic and international communication. Today, I am delighted to see the telecommunications communication between China and the United States take a further step forward. Although wireless and submarine cable communications between China and the United States are convenient, the addition of this latest communication tool will surely make the friendship and business relations between the two countries closer. I wish Your Excellency success in this new venture." (3) Chairman Bullitt of the U.S. Communications Commission's congratulatory message to Minister Yu: "I would like to extend my congratulations to Minister of Communications Yu Feipeng. As Chairman of the U.S. Communications Commission, I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to your government and Your Excellency on the opening of this new era in international communication. Since Your Excellency took office as Minister of Communications of your country, you have made remarkable achievements in the construction of wireless communication between our two great countries. From now on, the telephones between your great Shanghai and our country can be connected to each other. This engineering success is truly unbelievable. Although our two countries are separated by six thousand miles across the Pacific Ocean, we can communicate with each other by telephone. Our intentions can be transmitted nine thousand miles away in an instant through the wireless communication network. The connection between the two sides of the Pacific Ocean relies entirely on the shortwave wireless stations in Shanghai and San Francisco. The opening of the wireless telephone between our two countries this time is a significant contribution to the cooperation between the two countries. Your country's government deserves praise for this great construction, and our country, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which is in charge of this great telephone line connecting the oceans, also deserves praise. International trade always relies on the convenience of transportation, and developing mutual understanding between the people of the two countries is enough to enhance the friendship between the two countries. Therefore, with the opening of this new circuit, we can foresee the increasing prosperity of commerce and the improvement of good neighborly relations between our two countries. Goodbye, and I wish Your Excellency prosperity." (4) Acting Mayor Yu's congratulatory message to Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Division of the U.S. State Department Hornbeck, "Dr. Hornbeck, thank you very much for your congratulations. On behalf of the Shanghai Municipal Government, I congratulate your country and Your Excellency. The friendship between China and the United States over the years is known to all and need not be repeated. Today, China and the United States officially began communication, and this is what we Orientals have been hoping for. This communication can connect any place in the United States to the Chinese wireless telephone. A new path can be opened for cooperation between China and the United States, and the relationship between the two sides will definitely be closer. China and the United States, with the convenience of wireless telephone communication, will also have considerable assistance for international trade. Wireless telephone communication can shorten the distance between the two sides, and space obstacles cannot prevent communication. Because of the opportunity to communicate, the two sides can understand each other better and have less separation. We should thank the efforts of all the organizers for the opening of Sino-American telephone communication today. The citizens of Shanghai wish your country prosperity and Your Excellency health." Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Division of the U.S. State Department Hornbeck's reply to Acting Mayor Yu's congratulatory message, "May I ask if Mayor Yu is well? It is a pleasure to celebrate with Your Excellency on this occasion. We are pleased to receive reports of the progress of your country's facilities in Shanghai in recent months. The commercial, shipping, and cultural undertakings of this great commercial port (referring to Shanghai) have attracted worldwide attention. I am sure that the service of telephone communication will benefit us greatly. I wish Your Excellency and your colleagues a bright future." (6) Vice Minister Peng of the Ministry of Communications' message to Vice Chairman Miller of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, translated: "To His Excellency Vice Chairman Miller of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, on the occasion of the opening of wireless telephone between our two countries today, I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to Your Excellency and your colleagues on behalf of the colleagues of the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and International Radio Station. In the past few months, your company has worked with us to establish this new circuit, and we are very grateful. I firmly believe that with this goodwill and spirit of cooperation, we will be able to make the wireless telephone business more prosperous and increase the benefits of our two countries. I wish you good health." (7) Vice Chairman Miller of the American Telegraph Company replied, "Vice Minister Peng, on the occasion of the Sino-American Communication Ceremony, I am delighted to hear the teachings of Your Excellency and all the gentlemen who participated in the ceremony in Shanghai. Our company congratulates your department on its success. This move will not only make China and the United States more friendly, but also bring the people of both sides closer together through this connection. With the consent of your department, I hereby announce the official opening of Sino-American telephone communication here. Thank you, Vice Minister Peng. Goodbye."

Madam Chiang's Talk

Madam Chiang spoke with First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, saying, "Science is truly omnipotent. We are talking across the Pacific Ocean as if we were in the same room. This is certainly ironclad proof that science can eliminate all distances between nations. However, science is now focusing more and more on eliminating nations themselves. Isn't that too bad? I often think about how women in our world should encourage scientists to find ways to maintain human life, instead of slaughtering humans in piles like in Spain now. Politicians in the world today seem to have no ability to maintain peace, and arms manufacturers are even more unwilling to see peace realized. Can't we women remedy this defect? I feel that if the rearmament of the world does not stop, the Second World War cannot be avoided. I say this, of course, with a feeling, because our country has been threatened by war for several years. Now I can reassure you that the air here is much clearer than before. If the situation can continue to improve, perhaps peace in the Far East can be maintained, or perhaps the era of international adherence to treaties has not passed after all. We Chinese women often pay attention to the many works you have done for the American people, and we find them meaningful and admirable. We hope that you can expand the scope of your work to mobilize women around the world to seek peace and maintain it forever. This is what Chinese women are willing to do. I had planned to go to the United States this spring to meet with you and talk, but unfortunately, I was prevented by something. Today, I have this opportunity to talk to you and personally tell you my own and Chinese women's blessings to you. I am really happy."

Madam Kung's Talk

Madam Kung had met Mrs. Roosevelt five years ago, so their conversation focused more on personal friendship. The original words were, "I am really happy to hear your voice on the phone. I didn't expect that we have been separated for five years, and science has created such amazing achievements. I really don't know what miracles will happen in another five years. My husband is now in London, and I often talk to him on the phone. His voice is very clear. You may find this news interesting. Now that we have the phone, people who are far away can talk like meeting in the same room. Of course, this will help the world unite in the future. This is the scientist making up for the failure of the politician. The world is waiting for the successful to make up for the failures and create the highest happiness for mankind. When Minister Kung returns to China, he plans to pass through the United States. Of course, he will come to visit you and the President. I hate not being able to go abroad with him. I often hear that you and the President are coming to China. I hope this news is true. If this really becomes a reality, I will be happy to see you. Even the Chinese people will definitely welcome you warmly. Because we have always maintained extremely close feelings towards the United States and the Roosevelt government, please convey the meaning of many people in China who love and admire the President to the President. They hope that his career will flourish and that his political health will be good. I wish you more blessings."

Thomson's Telegram of Congratulations

Mr. Thomson, manager of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, telegraphed Wen Yuqing, Director of the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications of our country yesterday to congratulate him, briefly saying, "Congratulations on the success of the Sino-American Communication, and thank you for your cooperation," etc.

Wang and Shi's Conversation

Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Chonghui spoke with former Ambassador to the United States Shi Zhaoji in Cantonese, greeting each other. Mr. Soong Tzu-wen was unable to attend due to temporary business, and Mr. Chen spoke with Ambassador Shi on his behalf. When Madam Kung spoke with Madam Shi, she spoke in the Shanghai dialect. Madam Shi said that she and Ambassador Shi would leave the United States for China in a few days. Madam Kung replied that she would sincerely welcome them upon their arrival in Shanghai.

Communication Situation

As soon as the communication ceremony was over, ordinary telephone calls were registered one after another. It was reported that those who were connected that night included Central Committee member Soong Tzu-wen calling the branch managers of the Bank of China and the Guangdong Bank in New York and San Francisco, and General Manager of the International Telegraph and Telephone Company, Peen, Chinese Ambassador to the United States in Washington calling Shi Siming, the son of Shi in Shanghai, and General Manager of the Shanghai Telephone Company, Baud, calling General Manager of the International Telephone and Telegraph Company, Peen, in New York several times. Later, because it was late, dozens of business telephone calls that had been registered by both parties but had not yet been connected were scheduled to be connected on the evening of the 20th. All the guests dispersed in joy.

Congratulatory Telegrams from Various Parties

(1) The Telegraph Bureau requests to forward to Minister Yu Qiaofeng, Brother, and Vice Minister Peng Haoxu, Brother, Jianjian.

### Acting President Wang Visited Ambassador Xu Yesterday

Xu Shiying, our ambassador to Japan, has been recovering well after receiving medical treatment in Shanghai for an ear ailment. However, because Mr. Xu has been working for the country for many years, he has accumulated quite a bit of fatigue. Although the doctor's examination showed that all parts of his body were in good health, he should still rest. Therefore, Mr. Xu plans to move to the suburbs of Shanghai within a few days to choose a place to rest, so as to avoid the complexity of all social engagements. He is expected to recover completely from his old illness after about two or three weeks of rest. Chairman Chiang sent Qian Dajun, director of the attendant's office, to Mr. Xu's residence to express his condolences a few days ago. Yesterday afternoon, Acting President Wang also personally visited Mr. Xu's residence to see him, urging him to take care of himself and talking for a long time before Wang took his leave. Ambassador Xu will leave for his post after he has rested and his body has fully recovered.

### The Chilean Commercial Delegation Holds a Symposium with the International Trade Association and Business Community Yesterday

Suggesting that the two governments promote trade relations; paid a visit to Acting Mayor Yu yesterday morning and toured the city; various organizations and groups hosted banquets twice yesterday afternoon and evening.

The Chilean commercial delegation returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou the night before last and began its social engagements in Shanghai yesterday. Yesterday morning, they paid a visit to Acting Mayor Yu, and at noon, they attended a banquet hosted by the Institute of International Affairs and other groups. In the afternoon, they held a symposium with the International Trade Association and the business community. In the evening, there was a public banquet held by the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and local associations. The details are as follows:

Visiting the Mayor

At 11:00 AM yesterday, the delegation, led by its head, Irasuzuli, and all members, drove to the Municipal Government to pay a visit to Acting Mayor Yu. Mr. Yu, accompanied by Secretary Tang Shixuan, received them. They had a pleasant conversation over champagne and refreshments. Subsequently, Secretary Tang accompanied them on a tour of the new construction projects in the city center. Mr. Yu also invited the delegation to attend a performance by the Xiaofei Chinese Music Society at the Lyceum Theatre on Route Huersiai at 9:15 PM, with Secretary Tang representing him in the reception.

Afternoon Social Gathering

The China International Trade Association, the Institute of International Affairs, and the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association jointly hosted a banquet for the Chilean Commercial Delegation at the International Hotel at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Attendees included the host and guests, delegation head Irasuzuli, all delegation members, Xu Xinliu, Mayor Yu, Deng Bingwen, Tang Shixuan, Zhou Chengzhang, Zhao Tiezhang, Zhu Xinong, Dai Baoliu, Ji Zejin, Jin Runxiang, Yu Xueyang, Zhang Huikang, Lin Kanghou, Zhu Shaoping, He Shangping, Cai Wuji, Dong XianGuang, Zhang Zuyin, Zhu Meixian, Gao Shiheng, Miao Zhongxiu, Huang Shenyin, Wang Xiaolai, and Cai Shengzi. During the banquet, Xu Xinliu delivered a welcoming speech, saying, "Today, on behalf of the China International Trade Association, the Institute of International Affairs, and the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association, I sincerely welcome the Chilean Commercial Delegation to China. The business relationship between China and Chile in the past has been relatively unimportant. According to the records of the Chinese Customs, in 1936, China's imports from Chile were only 84,590 yuan, and exports to Chile were 29,084 yuan, each accounting for a tiny fraction of China's total import and export trade. The small amount of trade between the two countries is evident. One of the most important reasons for the lack of development in trade between the two countries is the restriction of commodity economies on both sides. However, because the commodities that the two countries need from each other have substitutes from other countries, neither side seeks to promote trade, which is also an important reason for the lack of development in trade. In terms of commodities, we know that Chile's largest import in 1934 was textiles, accounting for about 14% of the total imports, followed by mineral oil, industrial oil, sugar, and tea, each accounting for 4% to 6%. Among these major Chilean imports, we are unable to supply some, such as chemicals, machinery, and mineral oil. However, we are fully capable of supplying Chile's needs for some major commodities, such as textiles, tea waste, and industrial oil. However, because this has not been emphasized in the past, in practice, in 1936, China's exports of textiles to Chile were only 21,650 yuan, and tea exports to Chile were only 1,788 yuan. In addition, there were peanuts, about 15,559 yuan, and eggs, 1,647 yuan. These numbers are very small, both in terms of value and in terms of their share of China's total exports. This phenomenon shows the backwardness of the past on the one hand and can predict the possibility of future development on the other. Secondly, in terms of the commodities exported by Chile, we know that Chile's largest exports are nitrate and copper, the latter accounting for about 37% of the total export value, and the former accounting for about 28%. The next largest is wool, accounting for more than 6%, followed by miscellaneous grains. Except for miscellaneous grains, these commodities are almost all industrial raw materials that China does not produce enough of and needs. Therefore, there is great potential for development. In short, in the current state, trade between China and Chile is very backward, and the main reason for this phenomenon is that trade between the two sides has not been emphasized. We firmly believe that as long as the people of the two countries, first, can have a considerable understanding of each other's commodities, and second, can gradually bring their own commodities closer to the people of the other country, we dare not specify how much the trade between the two countries will progress, but it will certainly not be comparable to the current situation. It is敢敢断言的. This time, Chile sent a delegation to China to investigate business, which can be said to be the beginning of the Chilean government's attention to business with China. In addition to expressing our warm welcome, we also celebrate the future of Sino-Chilean trade. The gentlemen of the delegation are all political and business leaders of Chile. We believe that you will be able to have a real understanding of a new China in a short few days and will be able to put forward constructive ideas for the development of Sino-Chilean business after returning home. I would like to propose a toast to your health." Then, delegation head Irasuzuli delivered a speech in response. The banquet ended happily at 1:00 PM.

Minutes of the Symposium

The delegation then held a symposium with the International Trade Association and the business community at the Hong Kong Road Banking Club at 3:00 PM to exchange views on the development of Sino-Chilean trade. Attendees included Xu Xinliu and Bei Songsun, directors of the International Trade Association, Miao Zhongxiu, Cai Xiuqing, Ji Zejin and Cai Yaohuai, representatives of the International Trade Bureau, Zhu Xinong, Director of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, Cai Wuji, Li Gan, specialist of the National Tariff Commission of the Ministry of Finance, He Shangping, Director of the Zhejiang Fertilizer Management Bureau, Zhang Zhikang, representative of the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association, Dai Baoliu, representative of the Institute of International Affairs, Yu Xueyang of Tianli Ammonium Products Factory, Cai Shengbai of Meya Silk Factory, Tang Shengfan of China Tea Company, and delegation head Irasuzuli and delegation members Feijiluo, Garcia, Fanlanruila, Miller, Gaorui Ai, and Saleno, totaling more than 20 people. Xu Xinliu and Irasuzuli co-chaired the meeting. First, Mr. Xu delivered a speech introducing the delegation. Then, Mr. Irasuzuli gave a speech, saying that the reason why trade between China and Chile had not been very developed in the past was because China could not purchase Chilean nitrate. Chile's domestic financial situation was not very good, and it could only purchase more from other countries if it could export more. Trade with various countries was in a deficit position. Therefore, there were three types of restrictions on the import of foreign goods. However, although it was also in a deficit position with China, it treated Chinese goods relatively favorably, and the restrictions were relatively loose. The nitrate produced in Chile was a natural fertilizer, which was very suitable for use in China. If China could buy more Chilean nitrate, then Chile could also buy more Chinese tea, etc. Then, He Shangping expressed his opinion, believing that Chilean fertilizer was not very suitable for rice cultivation in the southeastern provinces of China and could only be used in dry land. At the same time, because nitrate was one of the raw materials for military fire, the Chinese government restricted its import. The promotion of nitrate fertilizer involved government laws and regulations and must be discussed with the government. He suggested that this could be implemented by the two governments through unified control, with the government purchasing on behalf of the people and then reselling it to the people to avoid various difficulties. Delegation member Saleno stood up to argue, saying that Chilean nitrate was not only suitable for dry land, but could also be used in rice fields if scientific methods were used. Subsequently, Tang Shengfan, representing the China Tea Company, spoke, hoping that Chile could purchase more Chinese tea, saying that according to statistics from 1913 and 1934, trade between China and Chile in tea was only about 2,000 yuan per year, and China was actually in a deficit position. Saleno then presented figures to refute. Subsequently, Ji Zejin stood up to explain, saying that we do not need to argue about which country is in a deficit position in the figures, but we hope that trade between the two countries can develop mutually. Finally, delegation head Irasuzuli requested the formulation of a proposal to request the two governments to promote trade relations. It was decided that Miao Zhongxiu, Li Gan, and He Shangping would represent the Chinese side, and Garcia, Miller, and Saqiano would represent the Chilean side to draft a resolution. The resolution was amended and adopted on the spot and decided to be exchanged and "signed" today.

Public Banquet

At 8:00 PM yesterday, the delegation attended a banquet hosted by the local association of this city, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the China Industrial Federation, the Joint Association of Domestic Products Factories, and the International Trade Bureau. During the banquet, Cai Shengbai delivered a welcoming speech, saying, "Today, we are gathered here to sincerely welcome the Chilean Commercial Delegation to China. This kind of opportunity can promote the friendship between China and Chile, which is a business relationship. With the presence of guests from both sides in this grand hall, it is enough to prove the friendship and goodwill between the two countries. From the perspective of trade between the two countries, we believe that there is considerable potential for development. In 1936, the total value of Chile's exports to China was 84,590 yuan, while China's exports to Chile were only 29,084 yuan. Among Chile's export goods, the largest items are nitrate and copper. With the revitalization of our country's industry, there should be a great need for these goods. Therefore, if we can exchange the special products of the two countries with each other, the two countries will benefit from each other, and the development of commerce will be a hundred times greater than today. Because of the appropriate exchange of goods, the economic recommendations between China and Chile will be able to make greater progress. This time, Chile sent a delegation to China to investigate business, which shows that the Chilean government has paid attention to the business between China and Chile. In addition to expressing our warm welcome, we also wish the Chilean commercial future progress and wish the delegation a great mission." Then, delegation head Irasuzuli delivered a reply speech. Mr. Irasuzuli first thanked the various public groups for their warm reception, and then described the progress of China's construction undertakings. To develop Sino-Chilean business and increase trade volume, he hoped that China would buy more Chilean goods, and at the same time, Chile would also buy goods equivalent to China's purchases of Chilean goods, so as to maintain the mutual interests between the two countries.

Today's Visit

The delegation is scheduled to visit the No. 2 factory of Wing On Textile Company and Meya Silk Factory this morning. At 1:00 PM this afternoon, groups such as the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, and the Money Dealers' Association will host a public banquet for the delegation at the New Asia Hotel. At 3:00 PM, the delegation will visit the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Tianli Ammonium Products Factory. From 5:30 PM to 7:20 PM, the Chilean Chargé d'Affaires and Consul General to China, Hua Jia, will hold a tea party at the embassy on Route Mayersiai. At 8:00 PM in the evening, Acting Mayor Yu will host a banquet at the International Hotel. Tomorrow, the delegation will be free to sightsee. Tomorrow night at 11:00 PM, they will take a train to Beijing to pay a visit to our government authorities and present a letter of credence to Chairman Lin. After staying in Beijing for three days, they will leave Beijing on the morning of the 25th and go north to Tianjin and Beijing, and then return home.

### Lin Weicheng, General Manager of China National Aviation Corporation, Succeeds to the Post

Li Jingcong's resignation as General Manager of Eurasia is not true.

Dai Enji, director and general manager of China National Aviation Corporation, tendered his resignation, and the Ministry of Communications selected Lin Weicheng to succeed him. Mr. Lin came to Shanghai a few days ago to visit Mr. Dai and discuss the matter. He is scheduled to return to Beijing today for instructions and will take over the company in early next month. As for the report that Li Jingcong, general manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, also resigned at the same time, it is a false rumor. The details are as follows:

Lin Visits Dai to Discuss Handover

After the Ministry of Communications approved Dai Enji's resignation as director and general manager of China National Aviation Corporation, it selected Lin Weicheng, member of the Aviation Commission, to succeed him. Mr. Lin arrived in Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago and visited Mr. Dai at China National Aviation Corporation yesterday morning to discuss the handover matters. In addition to ordering the various departments to complete the closing, Mr. Dai also returned to visit Mr. Lin in the afternoon. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Mr. Lin at his residence yesterday. According to him, he was ordered to take over the position of China National Aviation Corporation and came to Shanghai to visit Mr. Dai. However, because the affairs in Beijing have not yet been completed, he must return to Beijing tomorrow to arrange everything. At the same time, he will ask the central government to come to Shanghai to take over the matter in about three weeks. Under Mr. Dai's years of planning and management, the business of China National Aviation Corporation has been very developed. He will always abide by the established plans and work hard to implement them in order to facilitate transportation and develop civil aviation. Mr. Lin graduated from the Chunni Aviation School in the United States and the Russian Army Aviation School. He has a wealth of knowledge and has served in the Chinese aviation industry for a long time after returning to China.

Li's Resignation is a False Rumor

As for the saying that Li Jingcong, general manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, also resigned at the same time, it is not true. According to Li's statement to reporters, it is a false rumor. It is also known that the company is actively carrying out the resumption of the entire Ping-Yue (Beijing-Guangdong) line and is seeking instructions from the Ministry. The line opened a few flights a year ago, but was suspended due to the flooding of the Hankou Airport. Only the Ping-Zheng (Beijing-Zhengzhou) section was opened, and it has now been extended to Hankou. As soon as the Ministry approves it, it will be extended to Guangzhou. Regarding the establishment of a station in Hong Kong, after Mr. Li's previous trip to Hong Kong for contact, there are no problems. The company is working hard to facilitate aviation between Europe and Asia. The resumption of the Ping-Yue line can increase its efforts for north-south transportation and assist the Ping-Yue Railway to provide convenience to the people. At the same time, it can also start the connection between Europe and Asia. It is also learned that the company has ordered another Ju52 large aircraft from Germany, which is scheduled to be driven from Berlin to China this morning and will arrive in Shanghai 27 days later.

### Three Banks Advance 300,000 Yuan for Disaster Relief

The disaster situation in Sichuan, Guizhou, Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces is very serious, and Special Envoy Kong is very concerned. He previously sent a telegram from London in the name of the Chairman of the Shanghai Charity Groups Joint Disaster Relief Association to Xu Keting, Deputy Director, to be forwarded to the Central China Traffic Three Banks, roughly saying that this year's drought in various provinces is extremely severe, and the Association intends to raise funds to relieve the victims. The wish to donate funds takes time, which is not timely. It is proposed to ask the Three Banks to advance 200,000 yuan, which will be repaid after the funds are raised. He also entrusted Deputy Director Xu and Secretary Kong Lingkan to contact the Three Banks and Du Yuesheng, Vice Chairman of the Charity Groups Joint Disaster Relief Association, to handle the matter. Kong Lei's original text has been seen in previous reports. It is known that the Three Banks have already advanced 300,000 yuan for disaster relief. The telegram from London was also forwarded by the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance to Du, Vice Chairman of the Association. It was also decided that the Charity Groups Joint Disaster Relief Association would be convened today (20th) to discuss how to distribute and raise donations in order to proceed. Special Envoy Kong is far away in a foreign country, and he is so concerned about disaster relief, which shows his concern for the suffering of the people.

### The American and German Ambassadors Come to Shanghai Together

The American Ambassador to China, Johnson, left Beijing by his own car yesterday, followed the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway to the Xihu Highway, and arrived in Shanghai in the evening, resting at the private residence of the American Consul General to Shanghai, Goff, on Anhe Temple Road. He came here specifically to participate in the Sino-American wireless telephone conversation ceremony last night and is scheduled to return to Beijing today. The German Ambassador to China, Doddman, came to Shanghai from Beijing last night to attend the 30th anniversary celebration of Tongji University this morning.

### The Municipal Government Establishes Various Exhibitions to Commemorate the 10th Anniversary of its Founding

An appropriation of 50,000 yuan to build the Machine Exhibition Hall

The Municipal Government will hold the 10th anniversary of its founding on July 7th this year, and at the same time, it will hold various exhibitions. Regarding the industrial exhibition, it will be organized by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. The Bureau has solicited various exhibits from all parties concerned in the city, divided into three categories: handicrafts, machinery, and safety industrial products. The exhibition halls have also been surveyed and determined. The handicraft exhibition hall will be selected in the stadium, the safety industrial products will be selected in the central primary school, and the machine exhibition hall will be built separately with an appropriation of 50,000 yuan from the Municipal Government.

### The Overseas Chinese Tourist Group from Semarang Returns to the South Today

The Overseas Chinese Tourist Group from Semarang returned to China last month and went to various places in Beijing, Tianjin, and Wuhan for inspection. The trip has been completed, and they arrived in Shanghai in batches the day before yesterday. They are scheduled to leave Shanghai on the Zhuhadet (sp?) ship of the Java Shipping Company at 8:00 AM this morning and go straight back to Semarang. According to a member of the group, the Central News Agency reporter said that the group went to various places in China for sightseeing and inspected various construction projects. The trip lasted for two months, and they were well-impressed everywhere they went. The rapid development of construction undertakings in various places and the unanimous support of the people for the central government made all the members of the group rejoice even more. There are 25 members of the group. When they arrived in Beijing, two members went to Japan for inspection. Therefore, 23 people will return to Southeast Asia from Shanghai. After returning to Semarang, they will tell the local overseas Chinese what they have gained from this trip. Overseas Chinese are very concerned about everything in China. Therefore, they will return to China in batches for sightseeing in the future.

### The Charity Disaster Relief Association Allocates 40,000 Yuan to be Remitted to Henan Province for Relief First

The Shanghai Charity Groups Joint Disaster Relief Association received a telegram from the Henan Provincial Relief Association yesterday, saying (title omitted) that according to Guan, Member Zisu's telegram, it is briefly stated that the official has been following the relief grain westward to Mianchi and southward to Xuchang in recent days and will report the rainfall and disaster situation in various counties he has personally seen as follows: (1) Disaster victims are constantly appearing along the Longhai Railway, either begging from people or taking a car south to eat. The situation of hunger is very pitiful, especially in Mianchi. When the relief grain car arrived at Yima Station, which belongs to Mianchi, at dawn, hundreds of women and children surrounded the car and asked for two or three packages to fill their hunger first. Some even said that they would unload the car by force. After the official's gentle persuasion and the county government's consultation with the examiners, they were advised to endure for a while. The disaster victims rushed to the district office in Changcun, two miles away from the station, and demanded immediate distribution. According to the district office's police report, there were more than a thousand disaster victims gathered at the district office, and an old woman fainted and died in front of the district office due to hunger. According to a vendor at the station, many people died of hunger every day in the villages in the Nanshan area. After the official distributed the relief grain one after another, they dispersed. (2) East of Xishui to Zheng County, the rainfall is relatively large. The official has seen that the farmland ploughed by farmers is free of dry yellow soil for several days. The rainfall in Xinyan West to Mianchi is only extremely small. Although sorghum and cotton have been planted, they still have no hope of rain in recent days. From Zhengzhou to Xuchang, sorghum seedlings have emerged, but they have no hope of autumn harvest because they have no rain, etc. According to Lin Jinqi, the magistrate of Luoning County, and the Tang Jianfang members, there have been repeated cases of selling wives and children and dying of hunger in recent days. The various matters stated are unbearable to hear. Although special funds have been allocated for emergency relief, it is a drop in the bucket and will not solve the problem. Please ask your association to find a way to provide relief as soon as possible. The Henan Provincial Relief Association respectfully asks, which is known that the association will convene a meeting of the Standing Committee at 4:00 PM on the 20th to discuss relief measures due to the urgent need for relief in the disaster area. It is also heard that the association first issued 40,000 yuan yesterday and remitted it to Henan for relief.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Briefly Discussed the Issue of Building Roads Beyond the Boundary Yesterday

No decision was made.

The Continental News reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council will slightly discuss the issue of building roads beyond the boundary again at the regular meeting this afternoon (19th). According to the opinion of the Shanghai Municipal Council staff, no decision will be made on this matter at today's meeting. The directors will only exchange opinions on how to solve the problem. The reason why the problem has not been resolved for a long time is that the Japanese Consul Yoshioka submitted a memorandum to the Shanghai Municipal Council, protesting the temporary agreement reached by the President of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Faithun, and Acting Mayor Yu to solve the problem. Although Yoshioka's proposal has not been published, it is heard that in addition to opposing the financial agreement on the problem, he also stated that the Japanese side is willing to expand the scope of the agreement to include taxation, telephone, police administration, and demarcation. The content of the Japanese side's proposal has been communicated to the directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council and recorded by the Shanghai Municipal Council and sent to the Shanghai Municipal Government. The Shanghai Municipal Council and the Shanghai Municipal Government have not yet held a meeting to discuss the matter. Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Council staff firmly denied the claim that the issue of building roads beyond the boundary has been submitted to the consular corps for discussion.

### Du Yuesheng Humbly Declines Birthday Celebrations

The Shenshi News reported that this year is Du Yuesheng's 50th birthday, and the directors of Fudan University took the lead in initiating birthday celebrations. However, the reporter saw Du's reply letter to the directors of Fudan University, declining the birthday celebrations, so he drove to visit Du at his residence. Du received the reporter. The reporter immediately asked why he firmly declined the birthday celebrations initiated by the directors of Fudan University. Du replied that he lost his education in his early years and always suffered from a lack of knowledge. He was always working hard. Although he received encouragement from all walks of life and made some contributions to the society, he asked himself that he had not made many contributions. The age of fifty has suddenly arrived, and he is ashamed and afraid to dare to say longevity. His humble intention has been detailed in his reply to the public letter of Fudan University, etc. The reporter left because Du was busy with public affairs.

### Yu Shang Two Hometown Associations Please Do Not Increase Salt Tax

Please Maintain the Old Tax Rate

The Shanghai Shangyu Fellow Association believes that the new salt law tax rate will be revised and the original tax rate will be increased. Also, changing kilograms to market pounds affects the livelihood of the people. Chen Jiufeng was specially approved to consult with the Yuyao Shanghai Fellow Association. As a result, the association and others jointly submitted a letter to the Executive Yuan Ministry of Finance requesting a delay. The original letter said, (Title omitted) that our county and other places are located by the sea and are salt-producing areas. Twenty years ago, the price per hundred pounds was only five or six cents. In recent years, one yuan of the national currency can only buy six or seven pounds. The high price increase has exceeded twenty or thirty times. However, the villagers have no place to buy salt, and the salt field people have no way to sell salt, resulting in years of fish and vegetables rotting in pain, which is greatly related to the livelihood of fishermen and farmers. It is heard that the new salt law is about to be revised, and there is a proposal to increase the salt tax every month. The salt tax rate is five yuan per hundred market pounds, and the fish and salt tax rate is two cents per hundred market pounds, etc. After reading this, we cannot help but be afraid. Salt is related to the livelihood of the entire nation, and fish and salt are also related to the burden of coastal fishermen. Even with salt production in Shangyu and Yuyao, which have not increased the tax rate, there is still a salt shortage, which will cause the fishing and farming sectors to stop fishing and planting. If the tax rate is increased again, the pain of the future cannot be fully expressed. The pain in other non-salt-producing areas must be even deeper, which can be imagined. Your ministry is isolated from the suffering of the people, and our association is more detailed because we suffer it ourselves. For this reason, we telegraphically report to your ministry for examination and approval, and we humbly ask you to handle it carefully so as not to harm the local area for public convenience. Shangyu Shanghai Fellow Association, Yuyao Shanghai Fellow Association, respectfully ask.

### Workers at the Second Meiya Factory Demand Fulfillment of Conditions

Factory Accepts All Seven Demands; Resumption of Work Began at 6 PM Last Night

The Second Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, located on Jiaotong Road (west of Gonghe Xin Road) in Zhabei, experienced a strike by its workers, along with silk weaving workers throughout the city, to demand improved treatment. The Social Affairs Bureau mediated three times and established compromise measures, instructing both labor and management to comply. However, the factory reportedly had not fulfilled all the conditions, leading the factory's workers to engage in a slowdown on the morning of the day before yesterday. Initial negotiations failed to yield results. Yesterday afternoon, workers from this factory, both male and female, held another meeting at the factory. In addition to the 300+ workers from this factory, approximately 1,000 male and female workers from other factories, including Tanjiaqiao Shixin, Fuxing, Jingmei, Far East, Meiya Ten, Rongcheng, Tongcheng, Chongyang, and Yuantai, also attended. Many more arrived to express their support. Xie Zhong, a service officer from the Zhongxing Road Police Station, and Xu Yuanlin, a patrol officer from the Taiyang Temple Police Station, recognizing the large crowd and fearing an accident, urgently reported to the Xinzha Police Sub-Bureau, which dispatched Inspector Meng with a large contingent of regular police to the scene to maintain order. Fortunately, the workers were well-behaved and elected representatives Wang Chunhui, Yang Botao, Liang Taiyue, Song Yuedan, Huang Zhaoting, and Jiang Buqing to engage in sincere discussions with factory representatives, including Factory Manager Li Peiyun. The following demands were made: (1) If the factory stops work for more than twelve hours due to warp or weft issues, the factory will provide each worker with a living allowance of 50 cents per day. According to the factory workers, since the last strike, only 50-60 of the 115 looms and their workers have had work, while 200+ workers have been idle, and they demand full resumption of work. (2) The 5% wage cut implemented last September due to the economic downturn should be restored, and full wages should now be paid. (3) The issue of maternity leave for female workers has been instructed by the Social Affairs Bureau to be implemented from April of this year, following Article 37 of Chapter 7 of the Factory Law, which stipulates that female workers should stop working for a total of eight weeks before and after childbirth. Female workers who have worked at the factory for more than six months will receive their full wages during the leave period; those who have worked for less than six months will receive a partial allowance. (4) If the factory stops work for repairs of looms or other equipment, each worker will receive a daily living allowance of 20 cents. (5) Workers who do not take leave within fifteen days will receive a bonus of 50 cents per pay period. (6) The yardstick should be converted to the municipal standard without discount. (7) Regarding the issue of board and lodging, the factory will immediately provide facilities. All of the above conditions were fully accepted by the factory, thus resolving the dispute. The workers, considering their demands a victory, set off firecrackers. The male and female workers who had come to express their support all retreated in orderly lines, and traffic resumed around 4 PM. It was also learned that during the meeting, male and female workers each held wooden sticks to maintain order, and police officers were stationed outside the gates to provide protection, preventing unauthorized individuals from entering, ensuring that the meeting was quite orderly. Normal work resumed at 6 PM last night.

### New Beijing Ship Workers Thank Yang Peng

Presenting Plaques

The "New Beijing" ship, a merchant vessel of the Taikoo Company operating on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, enjoys a flourishing business.

### Union Members Illegally Insult Workers

Related to Idle Workers at Shanghai East Factories: Police Transfer Criminal Case to Court for Scheduled Sentencing

Zhang Xianglin, from Yixing, Zhejiang, was a worker at the Jin (formerly Jinxing) Silk Weaving Factory at No. 36 Longshun Lane, Jianlin Road. After the factory experienced a strike and shutdown on March 16, Zhang secretly returned to the factory and worked privately. On the afternoon of the 12th of this month at 5:30 PM, he was lured to the Shanghai Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Union at No. 138 Jiren Road by fellow union members Wang Tongxing, Zhao Jinkang, Liu Hanmei, Si Baoliang, and Zhu Chengmei, where he was forced to kneel down. A piece of paper with the words "Zhang Xianglin Sells His Conscience, Jin Xin Factory Dog" was pasted on his chest, and a photograph was taken as punishment. He was detained for three and a half hours before being released. He reported the incident to the Yulin Road Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to the union and arrested Wang Tongxing and the other four, along with accomplices Wang Jihua and Du Meihe, a total of twenty-one people, and confiscated wooden sticks, pamphlets, documents, photographs, and other items. The First Special District Court has already arraigned and detained the suspects. As reported in this newspaper yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhong Qing specially convened a criminal labor court to review the case. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that among the large number of seized documents from the union, though there was nothing particularly important after inspection by the Chief Inspector's Office, Si Yao and Lou Zongfang, the chairman and executive member of the union, had instigated the work stoppages in several silk weaving factories in Pudong, which greatly affected public order. The Fourth District of Pudong is vast, with numerous silk factories, and the workers often used force to coerce others into work stoppages, deliberately disrupting order and violating criminal law. He requested prosecution. The victim, Zhang Xianglin, accused the defendants of forcing him to kneel down and photographing him with wooden sticks. Judge Zhong interrogated the defendants for a long time. After lengthy admonishments, they were returned to custody, and sentencing was scheduled for the 25th.

### The Citizens' Association Sends a Letter to the Police Bureau

Requesting Additional Police Force on Sichuan Road to Assist in Investigating and Arresting Organizations Selling Narcotics

According to Xin Xin News Agency, the 25th branch of the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District (North Sichuan Road) sent a letter to the City Police Bureau yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, this is to inform you that the North Sichuan Road area is an area of ​​extra-territorial roads, where many Japanese ronin and Koreans reside. These ronin, relying on force, secretly set up drug-selling organizations. The fog of drugs is pervasive, becoming a drug market. Recently, although the North Sichuan Road Police Branch has organized a drug-arresting team to step up investigations and arrests, but the ronin, due to their cunning plans, relying on force, and investigations and arrests are quite difficult. We believe that the anti-drug work is an important policy for our nation's rejuvenation. If they are allowed to do as they please, the entire ban will be completely destroyed by them. For the sake of the nation, and in order to step up arrests, we hereby request the Chief to quickly dispatch additional police force to assist in the investigation and handling of the case. Furthermore, those drug criminals who have already been arrested should be severely punished according to the law in order to warn against the future. We are extremely grateful." (The letter to the Citizens' General Association is the same and will not be repeated)

### The Dismembered Girl Case is Bizarre

The Head and Arms from Zhabei are Confirmed to Belong to the Same Body

Details of the tragic case of the dismembered girl that has attracted social attention have been published in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the Customs Water Patrol Police Station sent detectives on the afternoon of the previous day to take the recovered lower torso to the Nanshi Rescue Bureau to report to the local court for examination. Due to lack of time, it was changed to yesterday afternoon when Prosecutor Wang Jiamai was commissioned to lead personnel to the bureau to confirm that it was the same body as the head and arms found in Zhabei the other day. The bureau was instructed to collect the body first. Regarding the cause of the victim's death, because the case is bizarre and the truth is difficult to determine, all land and water agencies have been ordered to strictly investigate and arrest in order to solve the case as soon as possible.

### Danyang Representative Han Jingqi Talks About Ma Xiangbo's Birthday Celebration

Establishing the Danyang Xiangbo Library

The Danyang fellow villagers in Shanghai celebration delegation went to Beijing a few days ago to attend the 98th birthday celebration of Mr. Ma Xiangbo, the president of the association, and returned to Shanghai last night. According to Han Jingqi, the executive director of the association, the trip to Beijing was very impressive. Despite being 98 years old, Mr. Xiang's spirit and thoughts are unique and progressive, making him a role model for our younger generation. As for Mr. Xiang's daily life and diet, he is the same as before. The Beijing residence has beautiful flowers and trees, and the air is particularly good, which is enough for the elderly to recuperate. All of these can be comforting to the fellow villagers. This birthday celebration was also for the Xiangbo Library. There was some discussion with the honorary directors (Mr. Han is the executive director of the library). Our Danyang originally had a county library, but it was suspended due to poor management. The Education Bureau and the fellow villagers in Shanghai jointly planned to revive it. Last year, they visited Mr. Xiang and asked him to support various public welfare and cultural undertakings in his hometown. He generously donated all his books to start the initiative. After the colleagues withdrew and discussed, they all agreed that in order to promote Mr. Xiang's moral transformation in his hometown, the library should be named after Mr. Xiang. The board of directors was organized immediately to prepare for it. Under the leadership of Chairman Jiang Kesheng, it has been supported by various parties over the years. However, the fund books are still lacking. It is hoped that people from all walks of life who have a good relationship with Mr. Xiang will come to support the Xiangbo Library with the spirit of participating in the birthday celebration, so as to complete it as soon as possible and leave a lasting legacy for Mr. Xiang.

### Taishan Insurance Company Held a Shareholders' Meeting Yesterday

Taishan Insurance Co., Ltd. held its fifth shareholders' meeting yesterday. The chairman's report stated, "Dear shareholders, today is the fifth annual shareholders' meeting of our company. The company's financial statements and business report for the 25th year have been distributed to you. I hope you will have satisfactory impressions after reading them. The stability of the government's legal tender policy and the bumper harvest of agricultural products in the 25th year have increased the people's purchasing power, and the economic situation has gradually moved towards recovery. Unfortunately, the relationship between China and Japan is tense. After the Suiyuan War, the Xi'an Incident followed, which made the market unstable. Therefore, our company has adopted a cautious attitude in developing its business. Although the entrustment of agencies and the establishment of branches are in progress, we have tried our best to save expenses. Therefore, the total amount of premium income is 834,900.29 yuan, and the surplus is 86,093.14 yuan. In the fire insurance part, due to the price discount, it has been revised and implemented by the association, and the premium has been improved. Our company's business has increased significantly compared with the 24th year. Therefore, the premium reserve has also increased. After settlement, the surplus is 25,158.3 yuan. The water insurance part has also made considerable progress. Due to the increase in business and the reduction in compensation, the surplus is 12,766.46 yuan. The accident insurance business includes personal accident insurance, car insurance, glass insurance and various accident insurance. However, most of the business belongs to the personal accident insurance and car insurance. In terms of car insurance, due to the low premium and the high compensation rate in previous years, our company has dealt with it with a prudent policy. The income from personal accident insurance is not much different from that of the 24th year, but the compensation rate has increased slightly. However, the total surplus of the accident insurance department in this year is 12,691.43 yuan. As for the life insurance part, according to the general practice, the life insurance company cannot conclude a profit in the first few years of operation unless it encounters special luck and the compensation rate is reduced. Therefore, the life insurance part of our company did not have a profit last year. The amount of compensation paid is about the same as expected. Fortunately, the number of new agency offices and new business increased to 2,079,675.88 yuan last year. The effective amount insured at the end of the year was 4,551,652.19 yuan, and the life insurance premium also increased to 129,260.13 yuan. In terms of investment, the internal and external political situation was unstable in the first half of last year, so we could only wait and see, resulting in a huge amount of cash. In the second half of the year, the market situation improved, and we began to invest in succession. As a result of careful selection, all investments are very reliable. Calculated at the market price at the end of the year, the surplus is 10,055.08 yuan, which has been fully transferred to the investment depreciation reserve. The reserve funds for various insurances have been deposited in accordance with the usual practice. In addition to the legal reserve fund, the public reserve fund has reached a huge amount of 100,000 yuan. In order to consolidate the foundation of the company's life insurance department, another 15,000 yuan is set aside as life insurance premium. The board of directors believes that there was indeed a surplus last year, and proposes to distribute a dividend of 5%, and proposes to pay 10,000 yuan as remuneration for directors and supervisors and commissioners. The remuneration of directors and supervisors is actually small. The company's employees work diligently and are loyal to their duties, and they should also be shown some appreciation. This proposal is also approved by the shareholders. If the above-mentioned distribution plan proposed by the board of directors is approved by the shareholders, the accumulated balance will be 27,789.77 yuan.

### The Case of Conflict Between the Modern Old Woman and the Son-in-Law of the Kuang Family

The Plaintiff Requests a Judgment for Compensation of Losses. The Hearing Concluded Yesterday and the Judgment is Scheduled for the 24th.

Xu Xiujin, a modern old woman trusted by Kuang Zhongmou, the owner of the Penglai Market, was first the manager of the Shaoxing Opera Theater in Penglai Garden, and this year she also served as the manager of the Yingbin Hall Bookstore in the market, which caused Kuang Bao Wei, the son of Kuang, to be jealous and conflict with each other. Then Li Zhiliang helped Xu Xiujin beat Kuang and injured Wu Qinyan, a lawyer and the son-in-law of Kuang Zhongmou. Wu Qinyan filed a public prosecution against Li Zhiliang in the local court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Lu continued the trial. Li Zhiliang testified that he was 45 years old and from Wuxi. He was running a street in the yarn tape factory. Xu Xiujin is my boss. On April 17th, I went to the Kuang family company office on Yinggongci Road to sign. A total of two people went. We did not argue with Kuang Baowei. When I arrived at the Kuang family, Kuang Baowei was already wrestling with Xu Xiujin. There were about a dozen people. I did not do anything. At that time, Wu Qinyan helped Kuang Baowei beat Xu Xiujin. I went to persuade them to separate them. Xu Xiujin testified that she was 41 years old, from Shanghai, and was the manager of Fenglai Garden. Because Kuang Baowei ran around and insulted me, the reason was that I took over the Yingbin Hall as the manager, so he resented me. On April 17th, I was beaten by Kuang Baowei at the place of the big boss, Mr. Kuang. Wu Qinyan helped him beat me. Fortunately, Li Zhiliang came to persuade me, so I was also injured. Because Mr. Kuang advised me, I did not sue. Now there is a certificate personally written by Boss Kuang Zhongmou that I was injured (then presented to the court for inspection). However, Wu Qinyan is a lawyer, has wealth and power, bullies us poor people, and publishes my newspaper, and comes to Penglai Market every day to yell, saying that I am an old monster." After saying that, she cried loudly in court. At this point, Wang Weizhen, the agent lawyer of Wu Qinyan, immediately applied for an incidental civil suit, saying that the medical expenses were 146.1 yuan, and the business damage caused by the injury for two months was estimated at 300 yuan, and a total of 446.2 yuan was requested to be compensated for the loss. At this point, the court debate ended, and the judgment will be pronounced on the 24th. The defendant added a deposit of 100 yuan.

### The Postal Assistant is Accused of Embezzling Mail. The Trial Concluded.

The Defendant Called Two Postmen as Witnesses. The Debate Concluded Yesterday and a Judgment is Scheduled.

Luo Dezhong, a postal assistant at the Fujian Road Post Office, is suspected of embezzling a registered letter sent by Yunnan Huikang Company to Shen Zhuang on North Wuxi Road in Shanghai, which contained an aviation lottery ticket that had won 1,100 yuan. The police station filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court. The details of the two trials have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the case was continued in the Criminal Court 1 by Qian Hongye, the Criminal Court Chief of the Special Court 1. First, the witness Gao Zunyi turned himself in and testified that he was a colleague of Luo Dezhong, but the management of events was different. Whether the receipt for the Huikang letter was sent out was unknown. However, at about 9:20 in the morning, someone came to pick up the letter. It was unknown whether the letter taken was the lost letter in dispute in this case. Chen Canrui, the defense lawyer of the defendant Luo Dezhong, immediately presented two witnesses. One was postman No. 392 Dong Genfu, who could prove that he had seen postman Zhang Shiming send out the receipt, and the other was Qian Qinglan, the chief of the postman management, who could prove that Huikang Shenzhuang had lured and threatened Zhang Shiming, instructing him not to say that the receipt had been delivered. These two witnesses are extremely important and should be summoned by the court. The court then summoned Dong to the case, who testified that when the Huikang letter arrived at the post office, Zhang Shiming had taken out the Huikang letter. Because the mouth of the letter was damaged, he mentioned it to me. I instructed him to hand over the letter to the defendant. I did not know whether the receipt was sent out. Dai was then called to testify that on a certain Sunday after the incident, Zhang Shiming delivered a letter to the Huikang Company upstairs. One of the people in the Huikang Company said to Zhang, "You must not say that you have delivered the receipt. You must know that we are not easy to mess with." Zhang immediately returned to the office and reported to me, and I reported to Shen, the branch director. Wang Baohua, the postal inspector, testified that Dai had indeed reported this matter to us, and I had also reported to the Western Inspector, etc. The court, believing that the facts were clear, ordered the debate to begin. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi, based on the police's various investigations, believed that the defendant should be responsible for this case, so he requested that he be prosecuted according to the law. The lawyer Chen Tingrui defended that, apart from the defendant, Huikang Shenzhuang and the postman Zhang Shiming also had the possibility of committing crimes in this case. Before the criminal suspicion of the above-mentioned person was eliminated, how could it be forcibly inferred that it was committed by the defendant alone? Moreover, judging from the evidence in this case, the defendant has no suspicion of committing a crime, and he should be declared innocent. Judge Qian approved and declared the debate on this case concluded, and scheduled the judgment to be announced next Wednesday. The Postal Savings Bureau Established the New Transport Committee. After receiving the notice from the New Transport Association in this city, the Postal Savings Bureau set up the New Transport Committee. The General Affairs Department sent personnel to prepare for the establishment meeting at 5:00 PM yesterday. There were a total of seven members. Wang Zhijing was elected as the chairman, He Jingshan as the general affairs officer, Zhao Yingpo as the investigator, Zhang Cheng as the designer, and Feng Rongfu as the promoter. The remaining members were Hu Jianhua and Ye Hongshu. Jiang Ting, Ji Zhongyan, and Wang Lianshou were invited to be officers.

### The Tang Youqian Case Continues. The Murderer Resolutely Denies.

Another Major Criminal in the Case Was Arrested in Hankou. The End of This Case Still Seems to Be Pending.

Tang Youren, the former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, was assassinated by thugs in front of his private residence on Gansidong Road in the French Concession at 5:00 PM on December 25th of the 24th year. The murderers Liu Zhennan (from Hubei) and Qiu Jiyu have been arrested. After investigation by the French police, they were sent to the Second Special District Court, where the French police department filed a public prosecution for murder. The former criminal court chief Wu Gangxu and the current chief Cheng Liao Yuan have held trials nearly ten times. The defendants had previously confessed to carrying out the shooting and murder, but when they were transferred to the detention center for interrogation, they overturned their previous confessions and cried out for injustice and denied it. However, because the case is complicated and the investigation takes time, it has not been concluded. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Liao Yuan and Prosecutor Dong Qiming went to Criminal Court 1 to continue the trial. The French police department was represented by lawyer Fei Xizhen, and the lawyers Yu Zhongluo and Peng Xuan, who were appointed to defend the defendants, also arrived on time. The police department submitted the report of the police station's investigation that the two murderers and their accomplices lived in the Dongya, Dadong, and Yangzi Hotel three hotels on the day of Tang's murder, and two circulating books each from Yangzi and Dongya. The court first summoned the Western Inspector Geller (transliteration) of the police station in charge of this case to investigate the case and verify the gun and bullet wounds. After that, Liu Qiu and the two criminals were questioned, and they all denied living in the Dadong, Dongya, and Yangzi hotels. They claimed that the Chinese and Western police took us to see good rooms and told us to confess about the murder and anything related to the murder. We absolutely denied it. The official also summoned a witness. Because the case still needs to be investigated, he ordered that it be retried on a scheduled date. The defendants were still sent back to custody. According to the report, a major criminal in the case, Yang Yousheng, was arrested and is on trial in the case of the assassination of Yang Yongtai, chairman of Hubei Province. The end of this case is expected to be pending.

### Divorced Woman Accuses Ex-Husband of Fraud

The Ex-Husband Cannot Be Arrested. The Case Must Be Rescheduled for Investigation.

Chen Zongyu, a former clerk of the First Special District Local Court, and Wei Lanwu, the current recorder, were recently accused by Qi Huizhen, Chen's divorced wife, in the procuratorate of the court of having defrauded Yang Jifang, the owner of Puda Pharmacy, and Huang Huaisheng, the owner of Jinan Film Company. After Prosecutor Song Genshan held a trial investigation, Chen Zongyu was ordered to be released on bail, and Qi was ordered to point out the detention because Chen had not been summoned. A few days ago, after the procuratorate signed an arrest warrant, Qi led the bailiffs to arrest Chen at No. 32 Hengqing Lane, Beile Road. Wang Lanzhen, the woman living with Chen, said that Chen had not returned for three weeks, so he could not be arrested. Yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Song opened the 13th courtroom for further investigation. First, Gu Pengfei, the agent lawyer of Yang Jifang, was summoned, but Gu's testimony could not be answered earnestly because it had been a long time. However, he said that I was entrusted by Yang in writing because the checks issued by Yang were handed over to Chen Zongyu. Why did a third party, the Indian Hashira Singh, come out and claim it? Therefore, I issued a statement in the newspaper on his behalf. Then, Wei Suwu was summoned to the case by the court. According to the testimony, the matter of Huang Huaisheng was completely untrue. Qi's accusation was entirely based on the fact that Qi climbed up the relationship. When Chen Qi had a bad relationship, I mediated it at the Qiu's house on Daji Road in Ximen, but there was no result. At that time, Qi had even hugged me, or it may be because of this that she has a feud with me. Regarding this point, Qiu can be summoned to testify. Then, Prosecutor Song questioned Qi briefly and ordered a rescheduling for further investigation, and then adjourned the court.

### Liu Cuibao's Abortion Case is Judged

Liu Cuibao (20 years old), daughter of Liu Niu, a woman from Taicang at No. 9 Anshun Lane, Kangdi Road, French Concession, has been betrothed but not yet married. She was alone in the boudoir, but was seduced by the son of the second landlord, Wang Fei. Unexpectedly, she was pregnant for two months. Fearing that her fiancé would find out, it would be inconvenient. She discussed with Wang Fei and went to Ye Yu, a midwife at No. 197 Guangqi Road in the city, for an abortion. She paid 12 yuan and inserted a medicinal herb into her lower body. Blood clots fell out. Because the blood was not completely cleared, her mother found out and reported to the police to take her to the local court. Judge Lu ruled yesterday that Ye Yu should be sentenced to six months of imprisonment, Wang Fei should be fined 40 yuan, and Liu Cuibao should also be fined 40 yuan for listening to others to have an abortion, with a two-year suspended sentence.

### Inscription for the 30th Anniversary Publication of Tongji University

— Zhu Jiaju

Tongji University has been established for thirty years. Since I entered this school as a child, I have a slight understanding of the gains and losses of this school. I would like to briefly mention one or two things to inform the alumni and to tell the people of the country. In the thirty-third year of Guangxu (1907), Dr. Zhubao, a German overseas Chinese jeweler, founded Tongji Medical School on Baike Road in Shanghai, opposite Baolong Hospital. At that time, there were only a few Western-style houses, rented from the people. The house still exists today and has not changed its old appearance. Every time the car passes by, it evokes a sense of vicissitudes. Baolong Hospital was then called Tongji Hospital. In the winter of the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu (1908), Dr. Baolong passed away, and the hospital was renamed after him to commemorate him. Dr. Baolong was the leader of the German overseas Chinese doctors in Shanghai and the most prestigious foreign doctor in Shanghai. He was also wealthy, so he was able to independently establish a school. After Baolong's death, Dr. Fushabo succeeded him as the head. In the first year, he recruited six students who were proficient in English, which was the first grade of pre-medical studies. Duanfang, the governor-general of Liangjiang, recommended several students from the Nanjing Army to the school. At the same time, several self-funded students were also recruited, which was the first grade of the affiliated German school. During the second and third years of Xuantong (1910-1911), Duan continued to send fifteen students from the Army School and the Army Primary School. The Chinese Red Cross also sent ten students, and in addition, thirty to forty self-funded students were recruited. The number of students increased daily, so in that year, the first grade of the German school was divided into two classes, A and B. I was sixteen years old, and I had the ambition to be a good doctor rather than a good prime minister, and I admired the excellence of German medicine, so I entered the first grade in the summer of that year. At that time, the school system was three years for the German school, two years for pre-medical studies, and three years for medical school. In the first year of Xuantong (1909), land was acquired on Ya'erbei Road as the school site, which is now the site of the Sino-French National Institute of Technology. First, a lecture hall and two dormitories were built. At that time, the Chinese people already had faith in Western medicine, and they especially admired the excellence and development of German medicine. The name of Tongji Medical School rose day by day and developed year by year. It is no accident that we Chinese people admire German science and Tongji. In the second year of Xuantong (1910), the new building on Ya'erbei Road was completed, and in the autumn, it was moved to the new site, while the old site on Baike Road was used exclusively as the school building for medical school. In the third year of Xuantong (1911), preparations began to add an engineering school, and lecture halls and factories were added. It was completed in the autumn of the following year. I first participated in the Wuhan Revolution in March. When I returned east, it coincided with the establishment of the engineering school. I knew the meaning of saving the country through industry and the principle that revolution must be followed by construction, so I abandoned the revolutionary work and returned to school to devote myself to my studies. Therefore, after the summer vacation, I transferred to the engineering school. In that year, the school was also renamed Tongji German Medical and Engineering School. There were only six students in the first grade of the engineering school. The courses were extremely incomplete and extremely shallow. The factory was established because Mr. Belenz, the head of the engineering school, had worked hard to solicit donations of machines from the German industrial community when he was in Germany. They were shipped to the school one after another, and we were able to participate in the installation to gain practical experience. The scale of the factory was unmatched by any school in the country at that time. Although the overall curriculum was still inadequate, and there were few teachers and many talents were not suitable, such as the medical school teachers who focused on opening a practice and regarded teaching and research as a formality, it still failed to fully satisfy people. However, in all fairness, the school at that time was a more practical vocational school. The medical school had the prestigious Baolong Hospital, and the engineering school had a factory with relatively complete equipment. Students had more opportunities for practical training, and few schools at that time could match it. The German department was originally a secondary school, like the current affiliated senior high school. The training of language was quite emphasized at that time. It is believed that the teachers were not familiar with teaching methods, and they could not take into account the psychology of the students. I do not know the situation of other middle schools. Even the courses other than German were taught by unprepared people, and the level was shallow, which was not comparable to the slightly better Chinese-run middle schools at that time. After the first year of the Republic of China (1912), there were slight improvements year by year, but they were not thorough. Because the Chinese people had long admired it, the school's reputation continued to rise. Tuition fees were expensive and increased year by year, but the number of students still increased. By the sixth year of the Republic of China (1917), the total number of students in the school was more than 400. In the spring of that year, the French forcibly occupied the school because it was located in the French Concession's road construction area, citing the European War as an excuse. The teachers, staff, and students of the school were forced to leave the school, and there was a so-called re-establishment movement. The gentlemen of the Jiangsu Provincial Board of Education came forward to maintain it. I had just returned from studying in Germany a month before, and I stayed in Shanghai for a short time. I was slightly involved in the re-establishment because I admired German science. Although my country declared war on Germany in the summer of that year due to international relations, the school still used German and continued to hire German teachers as before. Except for the principal being Chinese, nothing else had changed. Since then, the Germans were able to get rid of the financial burden, and all the teachers in the school were still German. After the peace treaty was concluded, through the efforts of the teachers in the school, some books, instruments, and machinery were donated to the school from time to time by people from that country. At that time, the relationship between the school and the German side was only like this. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China (1923), influenced by the domestic movement to establish universities, the school was also renamed a university, and the German department was renamed the affiliated middle school. There was not much improvement in the content. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (1927), the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, and the Ministry of Education renamed the school National Tongji University, and the affiliated middle school was renamed the affiliated senior high school. The funding also increased, and all expenses were paid by the national treasury. Tuition fees were also reduced, comparable to other public universities. However, the internal administration and the authority of the Germans were still the same as before. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China (1929), Mr. Hu Chunzao took over as the principal and tried to reform, but he was unable to achieve his goals due to financial constraints and the environment. In the twenty-first year (1932), I led the Ministry of Education. Because Principal Hu resigned due to entering Sichuan, I appointed Dr. Weng Shuquan, the current principal, as his successor. I told him about the reorganization plan, still using German as the first foreign language, continuing to hire German professors, with Chinese professors as the main body, and only hiring Germans when necessary, and limiting their qualifications to university professors in their own country. The level of all teachers and the entire curriculum was also improved. At the same time, I first prepared to establish a science college to meet the university regulations of having at least three colleges. The engineering college added departments such as continental surveying, shipbuilding, and architecture. The medical and engineering colleges were expanded at the same time. The number of students was increased, and equipment was added. The housing and factories of the former Labor University were allocated to the school, and the school's affiliated mechanic school, which had been suspended, was restored and reorganized into the National Senior Industrial Vocational School. The school building was the old site of Labor University, with independent funding, affiliated to the university. The neighboring National Shanghai Medical College was also moved, and its school building was allocated to the school as the school building for the middle school department. The headquarters of the school building was now exclusively used by the university department. The school buildings of the two affiliated schools were separated, which was also convenient. The high school curriculum was adjusted in accordance with the regulations and standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education. Except for the German curriculum, all courses must be taught in the national language. High school teachers with excellent results and Chinese nationality were hired to teach. Next year, students will be able to participate in the joint entrance examination, and the number of classes and students will be increased. The two-year German remedial class was changed to a one-year class, and graduates from various high schools were admitted to receive remedial German, so that graduates from other high schools would have the opportunity to enter the school, and the number of classes and students was also increased to prepare for expanding the number of students in the university department. In the past, it was called a national university, but the number of students in the university department was small. The state allocated hundreds of thousands of yuan of funding each year, and only thirty to forty students graduated each year, which was too wasteful. Through the efforts of Principal Weng to reorganize, the above-mentioned reform plans have been implemented one by one. The atmosphere of the school is very different. The science college or the college of arts and sciences is now ready and will be established next semester. The engineering college has been greatly expanded, and the addition of departments has also been realized. The equipment of books and instruments has been increased. There have also been many improvements in the medical college. The municipal hospital established by the Shanghai Municipal Government has been allocated to the school as a teaching hospital. Zongliang Hospital is being prepared by the school. The opportunities for student internships are increasing day by day. The number of students in the university department was originally only 288, but now it is 550. It is expected to reach 700 next semester. The level of the affiliated high school has been improved. The general courses have been taught in the national language, which has been very effective. The results of each Shanghai Municipal Graduation Examination are very good, which is clear evidence. The old mechanic school had simple equipment and only thirty to forty students. Today's affiliated vocational school is used by students. The reason why we Chinese people have risen up and made efforts to achieve today's scale is due to the sympathy of the Chinese people for Germany and the belief in German science. The Germans who have made special contributions to the school include the founder, Mr. Baolong, and in the medical department, Mr. Fushabo, and in the engineering department, Mr. Belenz. Mr. Bei has made even more contributions, which our alumni must not forget. The number of graduates from the school in the past cannot be said to be large. The equipment in the school still needs to be improved. Looking around in the past ten years, many universities in the country have made great progress. The use of foreign teachers is only done when absolutely necessary. Not only have the internal affairs of various universities founded and maintained by various foreign churches been changed to be managed by Chinese people, but the number of foreign professors is also very small. This school is a national university. In addition to cultivating talents, it should also make efforts to cultivate domestic teachers. All my alumni must strive for the spirit of German research science, have the determination to catch up, encourage each other, and make progress endlessly. I hope for the good fortune of the school, and the country and the nation have something to rely on.

### Foreword to the 30th Anniversary Publication of Tongji University

— Zhang Qun

The establishment of modern education in our country has only been fifty years, and Tongji University has a history of thirty years. Compared with European universities that have existed for hundreds of years, it cannot be said to be long-standing; however, the difficulty of its creation and the greatness of its contribution are truly worthy of commemoration. Please allow me to briefly describe it: The thirty-year history of Tongji University can be roughly divided into three periods: The first is the period of German management, from four years before the founding of the Republic of China to the sixth year of the Republic of China (1917). During these ten years, it was a time of pioneering, and the scale was not yet fully prepared, but it had already become famous in the country with its medical and engineering departments. The second is the period of Chinese self-management, from the sixth year of the Republic of China. Due to the impact of the European War, the school was disbanded. Chinese people, because of its outstanding achievements and unwillingness to lose the opportunity for students to study, requested the government to jointly maintain it and renamed it Tongji Medical and Engineering Vocational School. It was upgraded to a university in the twelfth year of the Republic of China (1923), but at that time the funding was allocated from the national tax revenue of Jiangsu Province, and the highest administrative power of the school was controlled by the board of directors. It has not yet been officially named a national university. The third is the period of the national university, which was renamed National Tongji University in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (1927), and in the twenty-first year (1932) it encountered the January 28 Incident. Wusong, where the school was located, became a war zone. Although the school moved, education did not stop. In less than a year, it moved back to Wusong and expanded its operations. In summary, there are two spirits that have been consistently infused throughout these thirty years: one is the spirit of enterprise, and the other is the spirit of science. What is the spirit of enterprise? The predecessor of Tongji University was Tongji German Medical School, which was founded by the German Baolong. It was not much different from other cultural institutions established by foreigners in our country. However, it did not have any color, and it cultivated the youth of our country with the knowledge of helping the world and benefiting the group. Even if its motive was only to develop personal interests, it did not consider how to adapt to the needs of our country at first. However, the spirit of doing business for the sake of business is enough to inspire admiration. Over the past thirty years, all the principals, teachers, and staff have been rich in this spirit, which has enabled them to develop and flourish, forming today's brilliantly prepared Tongji University. What is the spirit of science? The medical and engineering departments are the foundation of all science education. Thirty years ago, there were few universities in the country that had medical and engineering departments. Tongji Medical School was the earliest to be founded, followed by the engineering department. Its pioneering work in science education in our country is truly indelible. To this day, talents in the medical and engineering departments who have served the society with reputation are mostly from this university, which is a clear and powerful verification of this scientific spirit. Because it has this spirit, it can overcome difficult environments, such as the closure of the school building in the sixth year of the Republic of China and the school site becoming a war zone in the twenty-first year, which were enough to shake the foundation, but it was ultimately able to maintain its survival, all thanks to this spirit. I was the president of the school in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China (1929) for a short time, but I had a spiritual connection with the teachers and students of the school, which has not waned to this day. The current president, Mr. Weng Shuquan, is a graduate of Tongji University, and he is able to carry forward this spirit. The scale of the school is becoming more and more perfect, and the future development is unlimited. However, our country today is weak and poor. Only medicine can cure weakness, and only industry can cure poverty. In the future, the great cause of restoration will depend on the spirit of enterprise and science, and there will be a need for medical and engineering talents. Tongji University will surely carry forward its thirty-year history to make great contributions to our country. On the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of Tongji University, I was asked to write an article, and I dare to briefly describe the difficulty of its creation and the greatness of its contribution to inform the people of the country; and I would like to work together with the teachers and students of the school to strive for the revival of the nation.

### The Outlook for Tongji University's Education

— Zhou Shang

Our school, since its founding, has now been thirty years old. Its system is based on that of German universities. However, every country has its own unique environment and needs. Therefore, while the school system can be emulated, the implementation methods and advancement goals should naturally change with the times. Only then can it suit the social environment, cultivate healthy youth, and meet the needs of the country. According to the current situation in our country, cultivating young people's special abilities is certainly important, but it is even more urgent to enable young people to cultivate their character and temper their physique to support their special abilities. After all, having only profound knowledge without noble character and a healthy body is still of no benefit to the country and society. I have always held a sincere desire for improvement of our school, hoping to adapt it to the education of the current extraordinary period, and I offer my humble opinions for discussion.

The mission of today's education is to encompass the training of youth in virtue, intelligence, physical fitness, and social skills, with moral education being the foremost priority. Our country has always been known as a land of propriety and righteousness. The so-called "studying to understand principles" emphasizes moral education. In the past, scholars and officials were able to encourage each other with integrity and regarded transforming customs as their duty. Descending to modern times, etiquette and righteousness have been lost, and customs have deteriorated day by day. Our strong and enduring nation has gradually become old and scattered. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, seeing the difficulties of the times, initiated the New Life Movement to revive the nation. The whole country followed suit, and the atmosphere changed for the better. In the future, the implementation of moral education in our school should take this as the standard, striving to socialize the school and discipline life, so that through long-term influence, the habit of being courteous and law-abiding can be cultivated, so that students will not fail to be the backbone of society, to enrich the vitality of the country. In the future, when they enter society, they will be able to fully exert their ability to serve society and influence the general working masses below the poverty line to jointly maintain order and stabilize social organization.

The tempering of young people's physique is particularly urgent at present. In this extraordinary period, without a healthy physique, how can one cope with extraordinary changes? Therefore, our school actively promotes physical education, ensuring that every student participates in sports. Every day, in addition to class time, they must be given sufficient time for exercise, allowing them to engage in training. In the future, we plan to actively promote extracurricular sports, such as mountain climbing and rowing. If these can be popularized, it will eliminate the weakness of scholars, revive the decline of the nation, and cultivate the perseverance to defend the country, resist the enemy, endure hardship, and withstand hard work.

In recent years, our school has added departments and expanded its scope rapidly, and the number of students has increased sharply, making the allocation of funds extremely difficult. In the next few years, it seems that the expansion of the scope should be temporarily suspended, and efforts should be focused on enriching the content. Although the various experimental museums in the school have already reached a considerable scale, the equipment in the medical and mechanical fields is already relatively complete, but the equipment in other departments still needs to be actively supplemented. This is hoped for with the assistance of various circles at home and abroad, and the efforts of colleagues, so that each specialty has a perfect research place, arousing students' interest in automatic research. I believe that the hope of our country's education today lies in students obtaining practical progress and eliminating empty academic pursuits. The so-called practical progress, in addition to including all scientific and technological progress, must also seek the youthful spirit and ideological development under the guidance of propriety and wisdom, so that after obtaining specialized skills, they can exert their abilities in a rational and orderly manner.

Students are the future pillars of the country. After graduation, they must serve the country and society. Therefore, the training of their group life is particularly important, ensuring that they strictly abide by discipline, obey guidance, and actively cultivate their public morality, reduce the expression of personal desires, and create good habits, making them comfortable with group life.

The goal of managing the school is as described above. As for the method of education, in terms of virtue and social skills, emphasis should be placed on persuasion and influence, avoiding extreme sanctions unless absolutely necessary. Therefore, individual counseling and collective conversations between teachers and students are particularly necessary. In this way, the boundaries between managers and students can be removed, and teachers and students can become friends, so that students' thoughts and actions and all measures of the school will not flow into extremism and rigidity.

The method of cultivating young people's intelligence should pay attention to the allocation of courses in various departments, the selection of teaching materials, and the method of teaching. In short, university education should be based on the principle of moving from breadth to depth. It is certainly undesirable for students to have knowledge confined to a corner. It is also inappropriate to have students conduct extensive research and increase class hours. The essential point is that each department of a university has its own characteristics, and each department within each college should have considerable coherence. The goal is not to create encyclopedic scholars, nor to create all kinds of specialized talents in the school, but to cultivate their basic knowledge, so that students can identify and integrate various sciences and obtain a higher vision, and can independently think and judge. Our country is in the midst of a national revival and urgent production and construction. This kind of talent is very urgent and needed. All departments of our school are practical subjects, and we should strive to create this kind of talent to meet the needs.

Our school's teaching method has always adopted the lecture system, without using narrowly defined books, but emphasizing notes and reference books, so as not to bind students' thinking. In the future, more attention should be paid to the development of students' thinking and the interest in automatic research. For various important subjects, it is planned to set up additional research hours, with professors and teaching assistants attending to enlighten students at any time and help them solve difficulties, so that students can gain a deeper understanding of what the professors have purchased. Therefore, the mission of professors will be even greater. All university professors, in addition to having both experience and knowledge, should be able to constantly innovate in lecturing, discussing, and criticizing. Therefore, traveling and inspecting during vacations to continue studying their knowledge is a necessary measure. Our school has already formulated regulations for full-time professors to go abroad for inspection, and those who have served for five years are entitled to a semester of leave to go abroad for inspection and research, and the daily life of professors should also be more stable, so that they can concentrate on education. All of this is to improve the effectiveness of education.

Although the above points are humble and have no high-level arguments, if we can follow this and make progress, it may also be adapted to the needs of our country's society and be of assistance in creating outstanding and healthy talents. Examining the achievements of our school in the past thirty years, no less than a thousand graduates from the medical and engineering departments have mostly served society with what they have learned and have won good reviews. From now on, we should be even more determined to improve, so that we can fulfill the functions of university education to train talents for the country. This article is just a brief outline. How to promote school affairs is still a matter for the common encouragement of colleagues and the timely guidance of people from all walks of life.

### Brief Description of the Research Halls and Practice Places of Various Colleges of Our School

Anatomy Hall

Built in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China (1928), the original classroom was not enough due to the increasing number of students year by year. At the same time, the anatomy practice room had to be expanded. Therefore, in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China (1936), a circular building was added to the south end of the hall and connected to the original hall. The right half of the bottom floor was used as a large anatomy practice room, which can accommodate more than 100 students for practice and can dissect more than 30 corpses at the same time. Microscope practice in the upper semester is also held in this room. The left half is used as a morgue. The corpses in the room are preserved with carbolic acid solution or alcohol. On the second floor, the left side is a library (currently with more than 800 books), a professor's office, and a teaching assistant and technician's studio. The right side is a large classroom (with 200 seats), and the rest is a specimen display room. The creation of the display room was established before the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China (1936) by Professor Ku Erci, the first director of this hall. Hundreds of specimens are displayed, made by various different methods. Among them, the most noteworthy are: transparent specimens with color injected into blood vessels, transparent specimens with bone stained, and visceral specimens impregnated with wax. There is also a storage room, collecting more than 300 wall charts used for teaching.

Physiology Hall

The Physiology Research Hall of National Tongji University was built from 1929 to 1931, and was first used in September 1931. In January 1932, it was severely destroyed by the Japanese. Thanks to President Weng's concern for reconstruction and re-equipment, all the damage was repaired after a short period of time.

The design of the Physiology Research Hall is suitable for 50 students in each grade. If divided into groups for practice, it can accommodate 100 people. Physiology and physiological chemistry are taught by the same professor, also imitating the practice of most universities in Germany in the past. This method is still used by a few universities in Germany. Although this kind of teaching also has many advantages, especially for beginners, physiological chemistry has always occupied a very large area in the field of physiological research. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to set up a special chair for physiological chemistry at Tongji University. This research hall was originally built according to this principle, and a place and equipment have been prepared for a professor of physiological chemistry to work fully. However, the funding for this part of the equipment is relatively tight and relatively simple.

Physiology is a course for the second year, fourth and fifth semesters of Tongji Medical College. In these two semesters, there are six hours of lectures, four to six hours of practice, and one hour of conversational experiments per week. The lectures are entirely in German. Although Chinese university students have a special linguistic talent, it is still more difficult, which must be taken into account. Because of language barriers, it is often necessary to repeat and explain in detail, so the six hours of physiology and physiological chemistry lectures per week in the two semesters do not feel too much. It is important to maintain constant contact between professors and students when teaching courses in foreign languages. Conversational experiments also provide a lot of benefits for this. The current semester's practice of four to six hours per week is equivalent to what is common in German universities.

As for the distribution of lectures, physiological chemistry is taught first in the first semester, followed by an overview of physiology. The second part of the first semester is devoted to lectures on metabolism physiology (in a broad sense). The other chapters of physiological monographs are all lectured in the first semester. The facilities for practice are based on the principle that all the theories taught in the lecture time are made clear and have a deeper impression by allowing students to engage in practical experiments; more difficult experiments are jointly instructed by professors and teaching assistants to each group of students. Special attention is paid to microscopic examination, so that students can get more concepts, which is contrary to the practice common in universities in Germany. To the extent possible, students are trained in various methods that can be practically applied in clinical practice in the future. All experiments are done by individual students or in groups. Because this practice divides students into two batches for classes in rotation, and there are two teaching assistants, each group usually has up to eight students.

Regarding the internal layout of the research hall (see map), to the extent possible, the rooms for teaching and the rooms dedicated to scientific research are separated as much as possible. The lowest floor is a large lecture hall (1) that can accommodate 110 students, equipped with projection equipment. Next to the large lecture hall are three rooms, one for preparing various experiments and devices for teaching aids (5), one for storing wall charts (9), and the other for a dark room (6) for various performances. There is also (1) an electroscope made of strings and an arrangement for photographic drawing. Under the large lecture hall is a hot water boiler (4). There is also a large room for a precision mechanical workshop (2), equipped with a lathe, a drilling machine, a milling machine, and other equipment needed for precision mechanical work. Many of the instruments in this hall, especially those needed for practice, are self-made or repaired by the workshop at any time. The workshop also has the responsibility of manufacturing and repairing models and instruments used by various research halls of the school. To the north of the workshop, there is another small animal breeding room. Opposite the preparation room is the janitor's room (7). Completely unconnected with the above rooms are three rooms (10, 11, 12) and an attached passage for an ethnological exhibition room, which displays many collections and photos, all about the non-Han ethnic groups in China. The collections and photos were collected by myself during my travels. I hope these things will become the foundation for a future ethnological research hall.

Part of the second floor is occupied by a large lecture hall that runs through two floors. The rest is mostly a practice room (13), where various physiological practices are held. In this practice room, there are 23 positions near the window, each position can be used by two students at the same time. Each student is equipped with a wooden frame, on which are placed various reagent bottles and other chemical working materials, a washing basin, two tap water switches, four gas switches, two electrical outlets, and a small cabinet to store various instruments. Whether doing chemical or microscopic experiments, the position is very spacious and without any constraints. On the narrower side of the practice room, there is a device for exhausting foul odors, a professor's working position, and a large washing basin. In addition, there are centrifuges and thermostatic heaters, all installed here. The center of the practice room is very spacious, suitable for various experimental works (such as experiments using blood pressure curve recorders), and can accommodate five groups of ten people each at the same time. When necessary, curtains can be used to divide the practice room into five small dark rooms for various optical experiments in physiology. With such equipment in the practice room, this relatively small position can accommodate a large number of students working with chemical, physical, vivisection, microscopic, and physiological optical experimental methods.

Next to the practice room are several small rooms: a curve paper smoking room (8), a storage room for chemical reagents, various solvents, glassware, and practice instruments (14), and a rinsing room (14A).

The third floor of the research hall includes the following rooms: (1) the director's laboratory (15), (2) the library, which is also the director's office, storing many instruments used for microscopic practice and optical applications (16), (3) the first teaching assistant's laboratory (14), (4) a large chemical laboratory (18), with a small room (balance room) (19) and an incineration room (20), (5) the second teaching assistant's laboratory (21), (6) a photographic dark room (22), (7 a dark room) (23), (8, 9) prepared for future operating rooms (24, 25), and (10) a rinsing room (26). In the corridor, there is also a suspended centrifuge, a battery charging rack, and a large balance.

Biology Hall

This hall was established on May 20th, 1935. The hall is located on the third floor of the College of Science, and is divided into: director's office, library, teaching assistant's research hall, microscope laboratory, biochemical laboratory, animal physiology laboratory, specimen making room, practice room (capacity for forty people), specimen display room, aquatic animal room (equipped with water storage device, reservoir, and air supply), dark room, and handyman room.

Each room is equipped with the latest furniture, and seats have electrical outlets, gas and water switches. The walls are painted with pleasing colors and hung with animal photos, mostly taken from Haeckel's Kunsuormen, der Natur.

The exhibition hall is approximately sixteen meters in length, with sufficient light. The arrangement is extremely attractive to visitors. There are whole animal specimens, skeletal specimens and organ specimens from each class of animal. The cabinet closest to the wall in the first room displays invertebrates: such as arachnids, myriapods, crustaceans, mollusks, echinoderms, worms, coelenterates, and sponges. The middle cabinet displays vertebrates: such as fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals. The second room is mostly for displaying vertebrates. In addition to prepared specimens, the central cabinet has large skeletal specimens. Those against the wall display mammals. There are prepared specimens of various birds and thousands of insect specimens produced in China. Those near the windows display soft furnishings, coral skeletons and various fossils. In addition, the cabinets on both sides, in the middle of the cabinets and behind the cabinets, are equipped with electric torches. Transparent specimens and various skeletons are clearly visible under the illumination of the front lines.

In addition, the library contains thousands of microscope slide specimens for student practice and research.

The work of this hall: The animal courses are as follows. Preliminary students are taught general zoology, classification zoology, general biology, genetics, especially the lectures and experiments on parasitic animals. After the establishment of the biology department of the College of Science in the next semester, pure biology courses will also be added. The research work focuses on experimental zoology and ecology problems. The results of various research have been published in other articles, which will not be repeated here.

### Hydraulic Testing Laboratory

The primary purpose of establishing this hall is purely for student experimentation. The intention and purpose are to have the following points:

1.  Students have a deep understanding of the impact of hydraulic power on rivers.

2.  Enable students to use buildings or models to control power.

3.  From the results of various experiments, determine the correct answer, because calculations alone cannot solve all hydraulic problems.

### When You Drink Water, Think of Its Source

— Huang Boqiao

Our alma mater, Tongji University, is thirty years old this year! Recalling when the university was first established, it was on Baike Road in the Shanghai Public Concession, only borrowing a three-story, three-bay Western-style house. Later, it built a larger school building in Baolong Road. Unexpectedly, the European War broke out, and the French Concession authorities confiscated the school building with lightning speed. That Baolong Road is now Albert Road, and that school building has now become the Sino-French Industrial Vocational School! I still remember very clearly the simple equipment in the initial period and the embarrassment when the French Concession authorities confiscated it. We must now admit the painstaking efforts of the school affairs负责人 in the past.

The confiscation of our alma mater by the French Concession authorities can be said to be the biggest blow to our alma mater. However, from then on, the national government was responsible for handling it, and school buildings were built in Wusong, which is more suitable for learning. After the end of the European War, our alma mater continued to receive assistance from the German government and the public, and gradually expanded. Now it has become one of the highest institutions of learning in our country. Perhaps that blow was actually the greatest luck. Seeing this bright and splendid school building, we cannot but admit the painstaking efforts of the previous school authorities in maintaining it.

I regard our alma mater as a person, who was born in poverty and suffered a lot in his early years. Now that he is thirty years old, he is a strong man, and it is time to make great achievements. However, a person will gradually become old in his adulthood. Even with good maintenance, he can only live to be seventy or eighty years old, or even about a hundred years old at most. A group, however, must not make this shallow plan. We always hope that our alma mater will coexist with the Chinese nation and share glory with the Republic of China. To achieve this long-term goal, there are of course many aspects involved. As far as our alma mater's students are concerned, we must all remember the source when we drink water, and protect our alma mater unanimously in the future. If our alma mater needs it, those of us who have money must contribute as much money as possible, those who have ideas must contribute as much ideas as possible, and those who have abilities must contribute as much abilities as possible. I still remember that when our alma mater was confiscated by the French Concession authorities, our students once ran around and shouted, and launched a school-saving movement. And got considerable results. Now there are 867 graduates of our alma mater, and the strength is particularly strong. We should continue this spirit, always have a love for the school, and be pioneers in protecting the school.

### Thirtieth Anniversary Address of the School

— Weng Zhilong

Our school has been established for thirty years. Over these thirty years, the surging tides of the times have been turbulent and overwhelming, shifting everything. Our school has also undergone repeated changes and developments to reach its present scale. I, Zhilong, was raised and grew up here. After returning from Germany, I have been serving here. At this thirtieth anniversary, my joy and excitement are beyond description! Deeply moved and earnestly concerned, I cannot help but express myself: In the past thirty years, our school has been renowned for medicine and engineering. Graduates have used their expertise to meet the needs of society. Their spirit of seeking truth from facts, enduring hardship, taking responsibility, and valuing accomplishments over personal gain has been widely praised. From now on, how can we continue to uphold this spirit and make it a distinctive characteristic of our school? This is one thing that Zhilong and my colleagues are diligently striving for day and night. Recently, the nation has been dedicating all its efforts to construction and national defense, both of which require technical talents. The pursuit of natural sciences is of utmost urgency. However, some students may become so engrossed in scientific pursuits that they forget the times they live in, while others may be so stimulated by the times that they forget their studies. Unfazed by the clamor, they often drift into apathy. With the national crisis at hand, excessive talk of fleeing south and cowardly reluctance to take action are enough to please those who seek advantage through opportunism. Furthermore, with conflicting opinions emerging daily, people follow their own paths, unsure whether to wear fine or coarse clothes, whether to learn to swim or to drown. How can we eliminate ambition, reject falsehood, and cultivate resolute fighters for the nation's future? This is another thing that Zhilong and my colleagues are diligently striving for day and night. Learning and thinking are equally important; this has been the case since ancient times. Without innovation, we will inevitably fall behind. Our country has benefited greatly from the world's scientific advancements, but our contributions to world science are rarely heard of. If we do not make efforts now, what hope is there for the future? Besides learning, how can we cultivate keen observation, meticulous analysis, and sound judgment to shoulder this mission? This is another thing that Zhilong and my colleagues are diligently striving for day and night. Learning values specialization and refinement, but it should also be applied effectively. Spending three years making a quiver is hardly praiseworthy, and spending a fortune on a prescription shows incompetence in grand strategy. The nation seeks to nurture talents, focusing on those who are significant and far-sighted. How can we ensure that they are not constrained by a narrow perspective but contribute to the overall picture? This is another thing that Zhilong and my colleagues are diligently striving for day and night. Our school was founded by Germans. Over the past thirty years, the Germans have generously supported our school. We deeply admire their scientific achievements, and we can also emulate their perseverance and dedication to overcoming hardships. I, Zhilong, based on what I believe in, and drawing on the strengths of others, have relied on the guidance of the government authorities since taking office. Graduates have made every effort to support us, and my colleagues at the school have worked tirelessly. In addition to the existing departments, the College of Science and the Department of Surveying in the College of Engineering have been established successively. Furthermore, we have jointly established a municipal hospital with the city's health bureau to facilitate the practical training of our medical students. In the meantime, the Ministry of Education, under Minister Wang, has approved funding for adding buildings and increasing equipment. The smooth cooperation with the Municipal Hospital is largely due to the assistance of former Mayor Wu of this city, Director Li of the Health Bureau, and many other gentlemen who care for our school. Recently, former school trustee Mr. Zhou Zongliang has agreed to jointly operate a hospital with our school, benefiting both society and the school. I am deeply grateful! The future is long, and those who travel a hundred miles are halfway there at ninety. May fellow countrymen and gentlemen not abandon us and offer good advice. This is not only the fortune of our school!

The amount of water in the testing equipment in the laboratory, like natural water, has a circulatory nature, but its scope is smaller. Water flowing out of a high storage tank with a capacity of 20 cubic meters passes through a long channel to a sedimentation tank, where all the accompanying sediment is deposited. It then flows through a measuring weir, where the amount of water can be measured at any time, and finally flows back to the low-water tank. A centrifugal pump pumps the water back to the high storage tank, thus the water flows in a continuous cycle.

The channel is 28 meters long and 2 meters wide, with a small riverbed and weirs and other structures. Students must personally test how to build spur dikes and longitudinal dikes in order to deepen the riverbed to achieve navigability, and test the shape of fixed weirs to minimize the destructive force of the water flow. For these tests, a photographic device is installed to capture various situations at any time, eliminating the need for time-consuming measurements. Finally, contour photography is performed, and the images are developed or enlarged in the laboratory's darkroom.

The measuring weir is not only for measuring the amount of water, but also for calculating the friction coefficient. This coefficient varies depending on the shape of the weir and is extremely important in various calculations.

We use a return channel to build a complete water lifting device, which can raise the water surface to three different heights through three different movable weirs. This type of movable weir is still rare in China. To allow students to understand the forms, advantages, and disadvantages of various weirs, the laboratory has needle-shaped, arch-shaped, and cylindrical weirs, all of which are very realistic. Students must use them personally. A water gate is built next to the weir to allow ships to pass through water surfaces of two different heights. The ship lock has several filling devices, and students can understand their usage through testing.

In addition, there is a small soil pressure box, which students use to observe the soil pressure on the wall. There is a new acoustic pressure gauge that can measure the actual pressure of the soil at depth. This type of test is currently being prepared.

In addition to this, there is also a full-size city street water pipe supply equipment, with live valve faucets and water meters, some of which are cut open.

### Shanghai Municipal Hospital (Tongji Cooperative Hospital)

### Electrical Engineering Testing Laboratory

This laboratory is located to the right of the factory and was completed at the same time as the school auditorium. It was largely destroyed in the January 28th Incident, and was only restored to its current appearance after being expanded and rebuilt.

Passing through the sports field, entering the laboratory from the east end, is the motor room. Practical training in heavy electrical engineering is conducted in this room. The room contains various motors and engines, as well as a complete set of DC and AC motor-generator units, managed from the distribution panel along the wall. During the experiment, after being instructed on the wiring, operation, and working characteristics of various motors, the students will operate on their own. The current experiment is to demonstrate the usual practice, such as the integral step work of three-phase AC motors, and the use of Leonard circuits to adjust the speed of the motor.

To the right of the motor room, there are two large rooms, which will be used as a weak current practice room and an electrical workshop in the future, but are currently temporarily borrowed by other lectures.

To the west of the motor room is the high-voltage electricity room, including a high-voltage test room and two high-voltage switchgear. It contains various high-voltage and ultra-high-pressure light tests, and tests the delay release on the oil switch to make the circuit open. Next to the high-voltage electricity room is the instrument room, which stores various instruments needed for explanation and practice. It also serves as a weak current and measurement practice room. It will also be used for testing measurement of light and telegraph equipment.

Next to the instrument room is an electrical engineering classroom that can accommodate 120 people. This room will be used for a test on the telephone, using an oscilloscope to convert the acoustic vibration formed by a person speaking into the microphone into a change in current, and at the same time observe the vibration of the human voice or its sound.

Turning back from the classroom through a dark room, there are tests on photography and optics, and a vacuum pump to show the application of various vacuum states in physics or industry.

### Part of the Biology Museum

### Machine Testing Laboratory

The machine testing laboratory is affiliated with the bellows mechanics and steam passing studies.

The machine testing laboratory is now equipped with multiple operable prime movers, with a total horsepower of 1,710 horsepower, and its attachments, various water pumps, air compressors, etc. Part of the prime movers and evaluation machines in this laboratory are used for teaching, and also supply water, electricity, and motive power to the entire school.

Since the reorganization of this laboratory after the January 28th Incident, the actual horsepower of the prime mover has increased by 1,374. Many instruments required for various machine tests and operations have also been added. These are now recorded in the monographs issued by various countries.

In the machine room of this laboratory, in addition to the power generation generator, the high shaft required by the factory connected to the machine room, and the electrical gate panel, the following machines are also installed.

One cold air injection diesel engine, three airless injection diesel engines, with a total horsepower of 270 horsepower.

Two single-cylinder (vertical, horizontal) steam engines, one vertical parallel double-cylinder steam engine, one small turbine, with a total horsepower of 160 horsepower.

Three automobile gasoline engines with a total of 130 horsepower.

One 450 horsepower single-row aircraft gasoline engine.

Various bellows pumps and turbine pumps.

Various air compressors (single-stage and double-stage) blowers.

One total condenser, the gas cutting degree of each steam engine can be input arbitrarily.

One ice making machine (for making ice for residential use in summer).

One lubricating oil cleaner.

Behind the machine room is the laboratory's steam boiler room, which houses a fire tube with superheater and a water tube boiler (the fire surface is 43 square meters each).

In addition, a boiler water softening device is installed, but it is not used because the water hardness here is not high. The scales for measuring coal weight and water weight during the evaporation test are also installed inside.

A 160-horsepower locomotive is in another room. It is equipped with the machinery and electrical appliances that a generator should have, and also has a high-speed regulator. This is necessary for a small-scale power plant (NeueldJIKulinke type). The significance of this prime mover room is to allow students to fully understand the steps and work that should be taken when starting, using, and managing it.

The open space next to the practice prime mover room is the aircraft engine test site. A 190-horsepower v-shaped Curllss machine has a rotatable eaves pulp pressed on the nose, and the fuselage is located on a pendulum frame to measure its horsepower. The horsepower measurement method of a 550-horsepower constellation BMW Hornel machine is the same as that of various airlines, and it is measured with a calibrated oar pulp. Lubricating oil, fuel, measurement, and other instruments required for management are placed in a small room next to the machine.

The classroom of the machine testing laboratory and a room behind it are used for small mechanical experiments. The test room is also connected to a model room, which houses a rich collection of models and drawings of bellows machines and boilers for students and visitors to refer to at any time.

The mechanical experiment hall covers an area of approximately 800 square meters, and as can be seen from the above report, it is distributed in various rooms.

The machine testing laboratory is equipped with various necessary instruments for operations, experiments, and examinations, such as dynamometers (including high-speed dynamometers), which can obtain ordinary, continuous, and open function charts, high-pressure measuring instruments to measure the pressure in the oil pipe during cylinder combustion, vibration measuring instruments (torque measuring instruments, vibration measuring instruments), mechanical and acoustic dynamometers, fuel analyzers, calorimeters (liquid and solid), etc.

The power generated by the prime mover during the experiment is consumed by a water vortex brake (Jnkers type and Krupp type), a pendulum generator, or an ordinary generator; (the electricity generated can be input into the water resistance). Smaller machines are consumed by ordinary brakes.

Charcoal and wood block gasifiers (using bamboo for gasification) are being designed.

The mechanical experiment course for mechanical engineering students is arranged in the last three semesters (three hours per week in the sixth semester, four hours per week in the seventh and eighth semesters). The programs it includes are:

Steam engine test (steam consumption), horsepower measurement practice, adjustment of inlet and outlet air mechanisms, operation management.

Steam vortex evaporation test

Total condenser test

Internal combustion engine test (adjustment mechanism), horsepower measurement, fuel measurement, indications during operation, identification of correct and incorrect operations, and installations.

Bellows pump, air compressor, blower, and turbine pump test, simple oil injection test and ventilation test,

Fuel and lubricating oil tests (heat, fuel point and ignition point, ash content, acid content, setting, weight, etc.).

Instructions on the use of fuel analyzers and other various instruments.

Vibration measurement and stress measurement either on operating machines or on specimens.

Starting this year, this laboratory will also provide trials for the attached senior vocational school of this school every afternoon of the week.

### Materials Testing Laboratory

### Practice Factory

The school's practice factory covers an area of 4,500 square meters and includes a woodworking shop, welding shop, casting shop, fitter shop, forging shop, quenching shop, machine shop, and masonry shop. The power comes from the machine testing laboratory. In addition to providing students with practical training, the factory also manufactures new equipment for various research halls in the school, teaching specimens, and wooden equipment in the school. It also manufactures lathes, planers, water pumps, vises, and other working machines for sale at any time.

First-year students of the College of Engineering start their practice in the factory on September 1st. The entire class is divided into several groups, and each group rotates through various workshops according to the procedures stipulated in the teaching syllabus. When practicing model woodworking, casting, fitting, forging, quenching, machine work, and welding, the mechanical practice instructor is responsible for guidance; the instructor inspects the student work in each workshop in turn during working hours. When practicing civil engineering, an assistant teacher from the civil engineering department guides under the direction of the professor. In addition, students must learn the preliminary work of common workers, and the electrical engineering assistant teacher guides under the direction of the professor. The practical topics are predetermined by the instructor. In order to increase students' interest in work, the practical work, in addition to those who learn preliminary techniques, is as practical as possible.

### Physiology Practice

### Materials Testing Laboratory

The school's materials testing laboratory covers an area of 500 square meters and is divided into four parts: steel strength testing, metal microscopy, reinforced concrete testing, and steel chemistry. The machines for steel strength testing include tensile machines that can also be used for bending and pressure testing, 20 tons and 50 tons each, a 6-ton tensile machine, notched impact machines of 75, 15, and 10 meter-kilograms each, a torsion machine, a continuous bending and torsion testing machine, a small continuous hammer sound machine, a hardness tester, a bending machine, a steel wire reciprocating bending machine, an iron anti-testing machine, and a screw press. The metal microscopy room has two photographic metal microscopes and one magnification photographic device, each with accessories. The machines for reinforced concrete testing include two pressure machines, one bending machine, two concrete mixing machines, two concrete tensile testing machines, and other testing accessories. The steel chemistry department can be used to chemically test the carbon, manganese, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus components in steel.

Fourth-year students of the College of Engineering practice material testing, and are divided into several groups at the beginning of the academic year. Each group of four people takes turns practicing about 30 testing topics. After each test, a test report is prepared based on the records and with reference to books.

### Surveying Hall

(Under Construction)

Surveying is the primary and first step in construction and development, especially the self-measurement must be started from surveying. The establishment of the surveying department of this school is to cultivate professional surveying technical personnel to serve the society. Recently, major German factories donated aerial surveying and geodetic surveying instruments, and those purchased by the school are also being shipped one after another. Therefore, a surveying department research hall is newly built next to the professors' residences to display various surveying instruments.

Construction of the surveying hall began in early May. It is three stories high and has an area of approximately 260 square meters. The steps wind around a pit, reaching a height of 20 meters. The pit is prepared for mining surveying, depth measurement, and the practical reading of underground points. A vertical measuring platform is erected directly from the cave, not attached to other buildings, so that the observation food is not affected by vibration. The first floor is equipped with a correction instrument and used for copying and washing photos. A light-proof revolving door leads to three dark rooms for easy access without affecting the work in the dark room. An inlay room, a drawing room, an instrument repair room, a writing room, and an assistant teacher's room are also located on the first floor. The instrument repair room also has a side door leading to the campus. Each floor has a large classroom, a topographic surveying food display room, and a professor's office. The third floor is the aerial surveying practice room, the storage room for maps and photos, the library, the reading room, the display room, and several workshops. Each floor has an iron door leading to the pit. Before the surveying hall is completed, all instruments are temporarily stored in the science college classroom.

Most of the instruments currently equipped in the surveying hall are similar to those of the Nanjing Surveying Bureau. The school has an educational agreement with the bureau. Students take courses at the school and practice at the Surveying Bureau, so as to cultivate specialized talents serving the surveying industry and promote China's geodetic surveying work.

### Hydraulic Machine Testing Laboratory (Under Construction)

Due to the late start of construction of this test hall, the internal installation could only begin near the anniversary, so all the equipment has not yet been properly installed. This hall is equipped with three hydraulic machines and pumps, all of which are self-made by the school's practice factory. All kinds of fluid dynamics, impeller shape, and cavitation erosion problems can be used for testing. The impellers of the hydraulic machine and a pump can be changed arbitrarily. Francis and Kaplan impellers of any shape and speed can be replaced, and their number can also be increased or decreased. The water flow in the wheel can be observed through light and dark rhythmic light. The amount of water is measured by a gap in the water tank. The horsepower generated by the hydraulic machine is completely consumed by a belt brake, as usual. The swing of the scale balance is used to adjust the speed. In addition, this hall also has an impact hydraulic machine for experimental needs, and a section of water pipe about 16 meters long to observe the problems of water flow passing through the water pipe. The water pipe can also be used to calibrate various water flow instruments. This hall has vacant land for future expansion. When expanding, it is planned to expand various water flow and air flow instruments as soon as possible, so one part has been ordered and one part is still being planned.

### Pathology and Pharmacology Research Hall

The hall is located in the city hospital base in the downtown area and is currently under construction.

### Overview of the National Tongji University Affiliated Senior Industrial Vocational School

In April of the 16th year of the Republic of China, the National Government was established in Nanjing and Beijing. Everything was waiting to be done. All kinds of administration was new. Following the late Premier's agricultural and industrial policies, it was planned to create a special school to cultivate talents to lead agriculture and industry, so as to start the revolution and construction. Therefore, Mr. Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng, Wu Jingheng, Zhang Jingjiang, Chu Minyi and other gentlemen proposed to build a Labor University. At that time, Shanghai Jiang and Chu had two model factories for vagrants. Due to losses, the school was closed. On May 9th, the Central Political Conference resolved to change the factory to a National Labor University. The Labor University was officially established.

In the summer of the 21st year, the Central Government ordered the closure of the university at the end of July due to the excessive losses of the university after the January 28th Shanghai War, which made it difficult to restore it. Therefore, the Ministry of Education sent Shu Zhendong, Dai Xia, and Yu Senwen as receiving committee members, and sent Section Chief Xie Shuying of the Higher Education Department to handle the receiving affairs together. The committee members arrived in Shanghai at the end of July and officially took over on August 1st. The reception lasted for a month before it was completed. After the reception of the Labor University was completed, the Ministry of Education hired Weng Zhilong, Zhou Shang, Cai Wuji, Kuang Songling, Pan Gongzhan, Pan Mingxin, Shen Yi, Huang Boqiao, Tang Ying and other nine people as members of the school property management committee by letter on September 16th, and appointed Weng Zhilong as the chairman and Tang Ying as the secretary. The meeting was officially established in Jiangwan on September 30th.

In May of the 22nd year, the Central Political Conference decided on the disposal method of the school property of the Labor University. All the houses and machines of the former Labor University College of Engineering and the real estate near Jiangwan were allocated to the National Tongji University for reception. And the Ministry of Education ordered to establish a senior vocational school. After receiving the order, the university established a preparatory committee. The president of the university hired the following people as committee members by letter:

Tang Ying Lin Geng Shi Bilu Situ Fu Zhou Shang

Huagena Liao Fujiun Lu Xiyan Xue Zhihao Zhao Da

Hessle

And appointed Tang Ying as the chairman and Hu Qinye as the clerk and general affairs officer. After the committee members planned in detail and discussed many times, they held two meetings in Wusong on June 19th and 21st to determine the budget for various expenses, various rules and regulations, and various course curricula of the attached school. The president was requested to review and decide,

The preparatory committee ended on August 1st. The president hired Tang Ying, a professor of the university, to concurrently serve as the director of the attached school, and Professor Xue Zhihao to concurrently serve as the director of the factory of the attached school. Under the direction of the president, they began to repair the houses, organize the machines, and add various equipment. Then they hired faculty and staff and recruited new students. The school officially opened on September 18th of the same year. The attached school was born then.

### Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Charity and Disaster Relief Association, 97 Renji Road

Appealing for the People of Henan, Sichuan, Gansu, and Guizhou Provinces Suffering from Disasters

It is found that the provinces of Yu (Henan), Shu (Sichuan), Qian (Guizhou), and Gan (Gansu) have suffered from severe drought from last summer to this spring. The land does not produce hair, and there is no water in the ditches. The people who are crying for help and waiting for relief are increasing day by day and becoming more and more miserable. Mr. Lu Bohong, director of the association, went to the disaster area to investigate and reported to Shanghai that the disaster victims were sleeping on the roadsides everywhere, and only a remnant of life was left from selling children and daughters. The miserable situation was frightening to hear. According to reports from the association's investigation personnel, Mr. Feng Yangshan and Zheng Shouchang, the famine victims have been filling their stomachs with wild grass and locust leaves, and now they are all scrambling to eat white mud, which leads to bloating, illness, and poisoning to death every day. It is not human life. The Association and the Chinese Lifesaving Society jointly handled relief affairs, allocated 61,500 yuan for relief funds, which has been carried out and distributed, and established reception centers in Luoyang and Zhengzhou. It also allocated 10,000 yuan to the Gansu Branch to engage in relief. As for the provinces of Shu and Qian, they are also handled by the branches, but the disaster area is vast and the disaster has lasted for a long time, so the small favors are not enough to spread. I hope that all the great philanthropists will be compassionate and generous, and donate them with great benevolence and righteousness to continue the remaining lives, and relieve the suffering of the people. I can't bear to wait for orders.

### Guide Impersonates College Student

— Zhu Xi

It was probably two or three weeks ago that I saw a news item about a dancing girl impersonating a student from Wu Ben Girls' Middle School. Although I didn't read the details carefully, I imagined it was nothing more than using the name of a female student to attract business.

Recently, there was also an incident involving a guide, Jiang Manli, "impersonating a student of Great China University in the hope of broadening publicity." After negotiations with Great China University, the guiding agency to which the guide belonged not only sent a formal letter of apology to Great China University but also published a notice in the newspaper to clarify the truth. This "impersonation" case, after costing three hours of advertising fees, naturally ended with "a sky full of stars, clouds scattered, and rain ceased." This is because Great China University proved that it had no female students working as guides, and the guiding agency also achieved a greater "publicity" effect through this "negotiation."

However, due to the frequency of such "impersonation" cases, I cannot help but feel deeply moved again! First, why do dancing girls and guides want to impersonate college students? In the world of sensual pleasures, education is worthless. The purpose of the dance patrons who go to dance halls and those who seek out guides is self-evident. So, what is the difference between a college student and an ordinary woman? However, it's not that simple. Those money-spending young masters indeed want to satisfy their desires through them, but they also need a novel stimulation. A dancing girl or guide impersonating a college student can use this to deliberately appear aloof or to evoke pity for a college student who has unfortunately fallen to such a state. In this way, in addition to "hoping for widespread publicity," they can also receive greater "benefits." It is a matter of "exchanging what I have for what they lack," making it a "fair trade."

Second: In the past, when a college student became a thief, the school immediately denied that it had such a student. Of course, the truth is impossible to know. Take Jiang Manli, for example. When she was making a name for herself in the entertainment world, her photos often appeared in books and magazines. We seemed to easily see "Miss Jiang Manli, a high-achieving student of Great China University, skilled in music, good at singing and dancing" and other "promotional" slogans. Moreover, she herself indeed claimed to be a student of Great China University, but no one ever "negotiated" with her. Originally, a college student working as a thief or guide after leaving school is not necessarily due to the corruption of the school's education. Perhaps it is also not the college student's own depravity. Yesterday, this publication had an article by Zhu Liying, "Working as a Guide for a Day," which stated, "Those with full bellies will never know the suffering of hunger. For money, humanity is forever separated into two different worlds!" That is the truth.

Thinking a bit more nervously, since guiding agencies were prohibited from publishing advertisements, it is said that the business of this "new industry" has also plummeted. So, they distribute flyers in hotels and inns, and publish disguised advertisements for rental of surplus houses. There are many different forms of this. Deliberately publicizing college students, the guides themselves, of course, are only "catering to patrons," as mentioned above. And on the guiding agencies' side, they may be prepared to publish apology advertisements to "promote business," which is also to be expected.

If the above assumption is not far from the truth, then "impersonation" will be endless, and "apologies" will be no less frequent. Those who want to lament something will have nothing to lament about. What else is there to say!

### The Sorrow of the Vitarricar People

— Tang Si

——One of the Travel Notes

The setting sun cast its light on the valley of Vitarricar, as red as fire. The valley was filled with enchanting laughter, reflecting the splendid evening sky. The forests sang softly in the gentle southern breeze. The valley at dusk exhaled the fragrance of mud and grass. The tiny gecko chirped softly, "gecko, gecko..." evoking memories of the gentle cradle of childhood dreams, as if intoxicated by fragrant and mellow wine.

Blood-like dusk, dream-like and beautiful valley of Vitarricar!

With strong strides, a line of people traveled from the warm south of Kotalcar to this Vitarricar. The mountain road was well-maintained, covered with unknown wildflowers. The green grass was also newly green and lovely. The hard stone road made feet that had walked on dirt and sand roads all day feel comfortable. How could one not feel a bit of tiredness?

"Er——du"

A sharp whistle cut through the air, shooting straight into the distant directions, circling in the atmosphere, sinking lower and lower.

The line of travelers stopped moving forward. On the slightly sloping grassland, we built our temporary home again. Happy conversations filled the valley. Someone was singing a love song of Kotalcar in a loud voice. Also, the iron nails of the tents were being hammered heavily, mixed with "Ah, ha! Ah, ha..." shouts. The valley was filled with noisy sounds.

Footsteps of "Da, da..." sounded on the mountain road.

Ah, the red, red Vitarricar people! They came, one after another, in a large group. They surrounded our temporary home.

"Come on, come together, don't be shy!" The white travelers smiled warmly and waved.

So, they all ran over lightly, bending down to look at the dirty white canvas, looking at the simple luggage in the tent, watching the struts one by one... whispering to each other, their bright eyes looked at us again and again, never tiring of watching, looking at one item after another, not wanting to leave.

It was night. The setting sun had long disappeared, and the splendid evening sky had turned to a thin, dark grey. The forests were blurred in the light mist. The tiny gecko no longer chirped, making people feel that the dream was deeper, the dream-like valley of Vitarricar.

We lit a fire! The firelight shone around the grassland, and the faces of the Vitarricar people looked even redder in the firelight.

"Ah, fire!" Who was it? (Which Vitarricar person was making such a loud call?) This call immediately resonated, loudly and clearly resounding throughout the valley.

"Please come over!"

Everyone sat down around the fire together.

The Kotalcar people in the south are passionate, and the Vitarricar people in the south are also full of enthusiasm. We immediately became familiar like old friends. The girls also started laughing and talking freely.

Someone ran down the mountain, and when they returned, they brought fresh coconuts, fresh green grapes...

We began our sumptuous dinner. Green grapes mixed with the local beer that the Kotalcar people gave us tasted very sweet! Drink, drink! We all got drunk.

A young, red-skinned Vitarricar girl with bright eyes, slender eyebrows, a well-defined nose, a small mouth, and white teeth fell into my arms. She was drunk, but she didn't laugh like the others. She was so silent.

"Ah, are you unhappy, girl?" I said in a low voice. "Southerners are always happy!" I stroked her hair, which gave off a sweet fragrance like wildflowers.

"The south is not a paradise either! Te A! (Dear) The southerners are ruled by white tiger wolves, they are slaves. Coconut trees are worthless, rubber trees cannot be sold, men can be unreasonably forced to work as road laborers, and women can be dragged into the houses of white people without resistance!" In her bright eyes, a flash of water appeared.

I helped her up and walked to the dark part of the valley. The valley was completely surrounded by darkness. The forests were laughing in the southern breeze. There were no stars or moon in the sky, a dark night.

We sat down on a rock in the valley. I looked at the distant, dark south.

"Tomorrow, will we still be in Vitarricar?" I muttered to myself in a low voice. Emotion gripped my heart.

"Are you leaving tomorrow?" A low sob was already in her soft voice.

"Maybe so!" The dark, distant south.

The firelight not far away dimmed down. The night of Vitarricar deepened.

"The sorrow of the Vitarricar people!"

I once thought about a seed carried by a bird from afar, unintentionally scattered on the land, nourished by rain and dew morning and evening, and irrigated by flowing water, then growing into flowers and grass, trees, and even lush pines. "This is so worthy of praise!"

### "The Moon in the Village"

— Lin Na

A Story of a Woman from Zamboanga

When the Spanish fleet occupied this rich island, the coastal tribes surrendered without resistance. Priests followed behind the armed forces, holding the Bible in one hand and raising the cross in the other, preaching to these barbaric slaves:

"Do not resist, accept civilization, this is God's will!"

Thus, the hands holding the cross and the scriptures were used to put chains on them and rob them of everything they had. The historical records of that time wrote: "Clerics enjoy everything: delicious food, tall and strong horses, beautiful women, all of which grow for them according to God's will..." But this civilization encountered fatal resistance in the inland Zamboanga tribe.

About twenty villages, before the invasion of the expeditionary army, unanimously used their poisoned arrows and swords to confront them on the vast grasslands. Priests sent scholars from among the natives, carrying crosses and scriptures, to explain God's will to them, but they were killed. Then, that night, there was a full-scale attack. The expeditionary army retreated hastily, many were killed, and the captured priests were led away with ropes through their nostrils. This angered the officers. According to God's will, they launched an unprecedentedly fierce attack. The natives were defeated and retreated into the deep forest.

The expeditionary army occupied their villages. In retaliation, during a celebratory feast, forty captives who had been searched out from the thatched huts died in a hail of bullets. Soldiers, like jackals, stretched out their noses, smelling in every thatched room, and there were pursuits and rapes of women everywhere. After three soldiers practiced their sacred rape in a thatched hut, one of them stabbed her lower body with a bayonet. Women who had their breasts cut off were often left groaning in the grass by the roadside, and even eleven- or twelve-year-old girls who had not yet fully developed were not spared.

The matter of fleeing into the deep forest was happening, and those who did not escape hid. But this atrocity gradually subsided, and women dared to appear outside the thatched huts again. Among them was a beautiful woman nicknamed "The Moon in the Village." After she had been raped by several officers, she suddenly developed a feeling of contempt for them. She had punched a drunken officer, but he only laughed it off. So she thought of the fate of the entire tribe, and of her dead husband. He was one of the forty sacrificed during the celebratory feast. With tear-filled eyes, she had personally watched him being shattered by bullets. When she was ordered to bend over and hold the officers' plump heads, she thought of him, the brave young man with curly hair who often stretched his mouth out to kiss her head involuntarily out of emotion. In the work of hunting wax, he was not a man but a lion. But this lion was killed, and she was now forced to sleep with the murderer. Painful tears covered her eyes again. Resentment grew in her heart.

One night, a revelation told her: "Revenge!" She jumped up and quietly walked away from the officer. The next day, she let her apron be worn in the newest fashion, with strings of wildflowers wrapped around her naked upper body, wandering outside the camp. The soldiers were seduced by her beautiful body and quietly left their comrades to follow her. She smiled at him like a prostitute, and frequently looked back.

When she brought her prey, who was staggering along for the sake of the anticipation of happiness, to an extremely desolate coconut grove, she suddenly stopped and began to untie her apron, completely turning herself into a beautiful nude statue of red copper.

She let him get complete satisfaction, and because of excessive fatigue he fell down. She stood up and stared at him with angry eyes.

"You are satisfied, you got what you wanted, then sleep happily forever here!" Without letting him move, she cut into his throat with a small knife, the short knife that her husband used to cut coconuts hidden here.

Half an hour later, someone saw her wandering around the barracks again.

This moon in the village used this method to illuminate the entire tribe.

### Sai Jinhua

— Chen Hezhi

Twenty-one

Sai Jinhua visited Waldersee that day. Waldersee expressed great welcome, inquiring about her situation since they parted. Sai Jinhua told him that her recent situation was very embarrassing. Waldersee expressed great sympathy, providing material and financial assistance, and told her that since the Allied forces had just arrived here, it was not easy to expedite various military supplies. He proposed that Sai Jinhua serve as a military supply officer. Sai Jinhua was also happy to help.

Whether it is a warm spring or a cold winter, my days pass away like this, silently. I sat at my desk once more, I picked up a pen, and I became like a prisoner awaiting punishment, feeling depressed and a sense of bewilderment.

Days are like an old, dark house. I live in this house. Just as I was complacent about this small world with nothing else, something came striding in.

I only remember that since last autumn, I casually moved my chair closer to the window to pass the dull days. I didn’t expect to get used to that kind of leisure.

So, a pointless seed was scattered in my life, growing lonely, absorbing the source of my life. I didn't intend for this, I had no time to irrigate it, but the seedlings were spreading, and blooming and falling lonely.

The days flowed slowly. The seasons belonged to the trees and flowers. From the falling of the poplars to the trembling of the sea, I endured the loneliness of the long years. And now, the flowering season is in full bloom, but I can only leave my house with a pale face, stumbling in the bustling city streets, wandering through crowded taverns, or just smoking a pipe, lingering in gloomy rooms.

I often pushed open the window and watched a person silently passing by the window. Every day, she always wore the same clean blue shirt. I only knew that her delicate hair was parted on both sides, with her temples drooping as if half-covering her ears, and her small footsteps scattered on the cinder road like white flower buds.

When that silent figure disappeared from the corner of the house, I slowly closed the window and retreated, falling back onto the bed as if I had lost something, and thinking wildly. My smoking frequency often increased in this way.

What is the use of that little nameless affection?

So I jumped up from the bed suddenly, smiling blankly and at a loss.

I felt that I was troubling myself for something. I vaguely mentioned it in letters to friends, and when the room was filled with cheerful laughter, I would also lead the conversation to a kind of ambiguous state, but when I was alone, I just turned pale and told myself some nonexistent words.

During the day, I sat down at the desk again. When I was working, I would suddenly feel inexplicably lost. I would contemplate, and then laugh for no reason from the contemplation. I felt that my usually orderly life was being disturbed by an external intruder, and a chaotic phenomenon was occurring. My time was no longer completely under my own control, but rather I was already under the constraints of time.

No matter what time it was, I would suddenly jump to the window and hurriedly push it open. What a trembling expectation I had! Only when I knew that I had been deceived by a meaningless rustling of leaves did I return to the table.

Only sometimes, I helplessly cut a piece of white paper and pasted it on the window glass, and vowed never to approach that bewitching window again: but these defenses were all temporary.

Tearing off that piece of white paper was often the next thing I did.

For a man, there is nothing more mysterious than the fantasy and pursuit of this pink shadow. This mystery transcends any concrete grasp. In concept, it seems to be a part of one's own self. It has already grown into a perennial flower, in a lonely life. And now, it is the season of full bloom.

I opened the curtain of the bookshelf, read so many books, one by one, but still could not make my reason strong, just as everyone had been weak.

I picked up the "Home of the Gentry" which I had just finished reading, and the stories of Lisa, Walna and all the characters in the book moved me once again.

I couldn't think of what kind of title I should give it.
