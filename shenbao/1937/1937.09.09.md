### 虬江 Wharf Full Day of Bloody Battle: Our Troops Firmly Defend the Military Industry Road Line

Enemy Casualties Exceed More Than Half, Annihilation Imminent / Enemy Communication Line Between Baoshan and Wusong Intercepted / Our Air Force Attacks Enemy, Inflicting Significant Threat

According to reports received at midnight, fierce battles occurred on all fronts yesterday. The enemy forces seemed to have launched a general offensive. However, our troops, while firmly defending their positions, seized every opportunity to launch counterattacks. Therefore, not only did the positions remain unchanged, but they also made considerable progress. The battle situations on each front can be summarized as follows: ㊀ The area with the most intense fighting was undoubtedly the Yangshupu district. Approximately one thousand enemy troops landed at the Qujiang Wharf and, under the cover of enemy naval artillery fire the night before, advanced to the city center. Our troops, in order to avoid the enemy's artillery fire, waited until they approached before launching a fierce counteroffensive. Yesterday, they drove the enemy back to the Qujiang Wharf three times. However, when our troops reached the wharf, the enemy ships immediately used machine-gun fire to sweep the area, making it impossible to gain a foothold. When our troops retreated, the enemy forces advanced again, but upon encountering our counterattacks, they collapsed again. By 6:00 PM yesterday, our troops were firmly defending the Military Industry Road line, attempting to suppress the remaining enemy troops on the riverbank in order to annihilate them. In total, after a day of fierce fighting, enemy casualties had exceeded at least more than half. The remaining enemy troops are absolutely no cause for concern. ㊁ The Baoshan area is still in fierce battle. Although the battalion of our troops trapped in the city has been cut off from external communication, officials firmly believe that this is due to a malfunction of the wireless equipment. These loyal and brave soldiers must still be fighting fiercely with the enemy. When the enemy forces advanced on Baoshan some days ago, this battalion of soldiers could have retreated calmly, but they were determined to defend the city with their lives, resolving to stand or fall with the city, showing a spirit of loyalty and bravery that is admirable. It is reported that our supporting troops, after flanking the enemy in that area, have implemented a central breakthrough strategy, cutting off the enemy's communication between Wusong and Baoshan. The remaining enemy troops in the northeast corner of Baoshan can be eliminated. ㊂ The remaining enemy troops in the Luodian area are still surrounded by our troops. The enemy forces once attempted to break out but were repelled by our forces. ㊃ In the Zhabei area, the enemy forces once attacked yesterday morning but were repelled. At around 10:00 PM last night, they attacked again. For a time, the sounds of artillery and machine guns filled the air, but our troops' positions remained as stable as Mount Tai. After a long and fierce battle, the enemy retreated again. ㊄ The enemy troops who crossed the Nansitang River via stealth landings in the Wenzaobang Zhanghuabang area were repelled by our troops, and there have been no changes as of late evening.

### Our Troops Charged into Qujiang Wharf Three Times Yesterday

Ultimately Unable to Gain a Foothold, Three Advances and Three Retreats / Our Troops Still Hold Military Industry Road as of Late Evening

In the Qujiang Wharf area, the enemy forces advanced rapidly after landing, once approaching the city center. When our large reinforcements from the south, north, and west launched a simultaneous counterattack, the enemy's advancing units immediately collapsed in disarray, and the two sides were locked in a stalemate between Wuquan Road and Military Industry Road.

According to the Central News Agency, the enemy at Qujiang Wharf forcibly landed on the 6th. Yesterday (the 7th), after our troops' intense offensive throughout the day, the enemy forces were forced back to the Military Industry Road area. Unexpectedly, a large number of enemy reinforcements landed to provide support the night before. Under the cover of enemy naval artillery fire, with armored vehicles as the vanguard, they launched a fierce counterattack towards the city center. Our troops used dense machine-gun fire and hand grenades to attack the enemy. The battle raged until around 11:00 PM. Ultimately, due to the intensity of the enemy's artillery fire and the armored vehicles' rampage, our troops, after making heroic sacrifices, were overrun by the enemy's left flank at Wangjiazhai and the right flank entering Wuquan Road. Then, before dawn yesterday morning, our rear troops also arrived to reinforce, joining forces to launch a fierce attack on the enemy. A heroic melee ensued. Our troops fixed bayonets and charged at the enemy, interspersing hand grenades to attack the enemy. All firearms were useless at this point, and the two sides were only fighting with flesh and blood. The enemy forces were unable to cope with this situation, and their lines were in disarray. Our loyal and brave soldiers charged through the enemy ranks, killing enemies like cutting hemp. The enemy forces abandoned their weapons in panic and fled, leaving corpses strewn along the way. Although our bayonets were stained red with blood, we still mustered our courage and pursued the enemy, taking advantage of the victory. By around 8:00 AM yesterday, our troops had reached Military Industry Road, and the enemy forces had retreated to the riverbank, in a state of utter disarray. The enemy in the Yangshupu area also launched an attack on our Yinxiangxiang area the night before, hoping to coordinate with the enemy in the Qujiang Wharf area to achieve a pincer attack. They were bravely repelled by our troops and did not succeed. At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, nine enemy planes bombed the Yinxiangxiang Racecourse area for two hours before leaving. Then, at around 8:00 AM and 12:00 PM, two enemy ships docked north of Lujiazui in the Huangpu River opened fire and bombarded our Yinxiangxiang area, but our troops suffered no damage.

After the enemy's attacks on Wusong and Shizilin failed, more than 5,000 reinforcements who had just arrived forcibly landed at Qujiang Wharf the night before. Our troops were forced to retreat slightly on the right flank due to the pressure from the enemy's artillery and aircraft and the armored vehicles' rampage. According to a certain police officer from the Jiangwan area who arrived in Shanghai yesterday, the enemy had been bombing and attacking the Qujiang Wharf line with aircraft and artillery since 6:00 PM the day before, as well as with mortars and machine-gun assaults. At the same time, more than a dozen armored vehicles were also cooperating in the operation. After a day and night of bloody fighting, our forward fortifications were almost completely destroyed, and we had no choice but to engage the enemy in hand-to-hand combat with bayonets. By around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, both sides had suffered great sacrifices. Enemy corpses were scattered everywhere, and the grasslands were stained red. At that time, our large rear units rushed to the front line and immediately joined the front lines to counterattack the enemy. Our soldiers bravely charged at the enemy with hand grenades, disregarding their own lives. The enemy was unable to withstand and collapsed towards the riverbank. We seized the opportunity to pursue them, but when we reached Military Industry Road, the enemy used dense artillery fire to cover their retreat. Because our troops had already reached their destination, they temporarily stopped to reorganize their lines. It is said that more than 2,000 enemy soldiers were killed by our troops' bayonets and knives. The number of enemy firearms abandoned was even more difficult to count. Three armored vehicles were also damaged by us, one of which was nearly captured by us. According to a senior military officer in command, the remaining enemy troops collapsing by the riverbank will be resolutely annihilated before this morning.

The enemy in the Qujiang Wharf area launched a fierce attack on us the night before, advancing to the city center. Our troops received reinforcements from the rear yesterday morning and joined forces to counterattack the enemy. By around 8:00 AM, our troops had defeated the enemy and reached Military Industry Road. The enemy forces retreated to the riverbank area near Qujiang Wharf. Our troops took advantage of the victory to pursue, crossing Military Industry Road and advancing. Yesterday afternoon, our troops charged into Qujiang Wharf three times, but because the terrain there was quite low, the enemy ships on the riverbank were able to fire dense machine-gun fire from a high position, and artillery bombardment was also added. Our troops, with no defensive fortifications, were unable to gain a foothold, resulting in three advances and three retreats. As of last night, our troops were still holding the Military Industry Road line, awaiting an opportunity to attack.

### Communication Cut Off with Baoshan Garrison

According to the Central News Agency, the battalion of our soldiers who were defending the city of Baoshan in isolation sent a radio message from the city at around 5:00 PM the day before (the 7th), stating that the entire battalion of soldiers had been fighting the enemy in isolation for 48 hours. Although casualties were heavy, morale was still very high, etc. Unexpectedly, this was the last message from our loyal and brave soldiers. After 6:00 PM, communication was cut off, and the situation in the city was unknown. It is reported that a small number of enemy troops entered the city from the northeast corner of Baoshan yesterday, but this has not yet been confirmed.

### Enemy Ships Bombarded Yuepu Yesterday

Our Pudong Artillery Positions Retaliated / Enemy Suffered Heavy Damage and Was in a State of Utter Disarray

According to official reports received from the front lines, the number of our troops stationed in Yuepu was originally not very large. Since the enemy forces attacked our Baoshan on the 6th, the artillery fire was fierce, causing the Baoshan troops to concentrate in Yuepu. Since the reinforcements rushed to Baoshan, at the same time, inadvertently, the strength of Yuepu's troops has also been greatly strengthened. Yesterday, from morning to noon, the enemy ships docked on the river surface launched a fierce attack on Yuepu. Our artillery also opened fire in retaliation. The enemy's army launched an attack on our positions under dense artillery fire. Our side, due to its strong forces, gave them a heavy blow, which was beyond the enemy's expectations, resulting in countless casualties and a state of utter defeat.

For several days, the enemy's attacks on our Yuepu have been met with fierce counterattacks by our troops, suffering heavy damage. They became enraged and ordered the enemy ships docked at Songkou to continuously bombard our Yuepu area with dense artillery fire from 1:00 PM yesterday, attempting to vent their anger. In order to retaliate, we also ordered the artillery positions on the Pudong side to bombard the enemy ships on the river surface and the enemy positions in Hongkou and Yangshupu with heavy artillery. The enemy suffered heavy losses from this attack and was in a state of utter disarray.

According to the China Eastern News Agency, at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, enemy ships bombarded our Yuepu positions with artillery. Our Pudong artillerymen, upon hearing the news, immediately retaliated with heavy artillery, targeting the enemy ships and enemy troops' base in the center of the Huangpu River where the artillery fire originated. The enemy ships were planning to use artillery fire to cover the enemy's army and attack our Yuepu, when suddenly artillery shells landed on the enemy ships from behind. The enemy was in a state of panic and did not know what to do, so they hurriedly retreated. Our western Pudong troops took advantage of the good opportunity provided by the Pudong artillery's assistance to bombard the enemy on the riverbank of Yuepu, causing the enemy to collapse and retreat to the riverbank. During the high tide last night, they tried to land again in secret, but our troops launched a fierce attack, resulting in more than 300 enemy deaths and injuries.

### Second Round of Reinforcements Achieved Nothing, Enemy Again Begs for Aid from Tokyo

Rumor that Matsui will be Replaced Due to Ineffective Command

It is reported that the two enemy divisions that were the second round of reinforcements have all joined the front lines. The enemy forces on all fronts in recent days have all been regular army troops. In total, the enemy's forces, excluding the naval landing force, include five army divisions, more than a thousand cavalrymen, more than 130 warships, and approximately 200 aircraft. However, after fierce battles in recent days, not only has there been no progress, but they have also suffered heavy blows from our troops, resulting in extremely heavy damage. Morale is extremely low and demoralized. Conversely, our troops' confidence has become even more resolute. It is reported that the enemy commander-in-chief Matsui, seeing that our troops' positions are as solid as a rock, and that the current forces will definitely not be able to achieve anything, has again begged for aid from Tokyo, requesting that another six army divisions be sent to Shanghai. The unit numbers that have been identified include the 3rd, 8th, 11th, and 19th Divisions. According to military experts, the enemy's forces sent to North China and Shanghai have reached almost the total number of regular army troops in the entire country. The later units are all composed of a mixture of regular army and reserve soldiers. Their strength is far inferior to that of the original regular army, and the Shanghai war zone is small, making it difficult to deploy them. Even if reinforcements are sent again, it will be difficult to achieve anything. According to a certain source, the Japanese military believes that since General Matsui arrived in Shanghai, he has been unable to slightly diminish the power of our army despite having strong forces, causing the prestige of the Japanese army to be swept away. They believe that he is ineffective in command and there is talk of replacing him. In addition, the enemy's air force has suffered extremely heavy losses since the start of the war. The enemy has also replaced the commander and sent a lieutenant general-level commander who has already arrived in Shanghai. In addition, two large squadrons of heavy bombers have been replenished and have also arrived in Shanghai.

### Unprecedented Tragedy at Songjiang Station: Enemy Bombs Refugee Train

Five Cars Destroyed, 700-800 Dead and Injured / Station's Overpass and Water Tower Completely Destroyed / Newspaper Vendors from the Daily Newspaper Association Also Killed

According to the Central News Agency, Japanese aircraft yesterday again carried out their inhumane, cruel, and barbaric atrocities, bombing a train full of refugees in Songjiang, causing flesh and blood to fly everywhere at the station, and corpses to pile up, which was unbearable to witness. At 10:10 AM yesterday, a train departing from Shanghai West Station, fully loaded with refugees, headed towards Hangzhou. At 12:20 PM, it arrived at Songjiang and stopped at the station. At that time, several Japanese planes flew overhead and dropped bombs. Five passenger cars were completely destroyed, including two second-class cars and three third-class passenger cars. For a time, the refugees inside the cars were unable to escape and all suffered this catastrophe. At least more than 300 people were bombed to death, and at least more than 400 people were injured. The station's overpass and water tower were also completely destroyed. After the enemy planes flew away, the station personnel were busy rescuing the injured and collecting corpses. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Japanese planes have repeatedly bombed our country's non-combatants and cultural institutions, and have always strongly defended their actions, claiming that it was due to military relations. However, the train that was bombed yesterday was obviously a train full of refugees from Shanghai to Hangzhou, and the misery of the attack was the most shocking and alarming. This kind of beastly behavior by the Japanese army will only arouse the world's anger and contempt.

According to the Central News Agency, of the ten passenger cars that departed from Shanghai to Hangzhou yesterday morning, when they arrived at Songjiang Station, half of them (five cars) were tragically bombed by Japanese planes. The number of dead and injured refugees reached more than 700 people. Zou Daxin, a newspaper vendor from the Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association, was also killed.

### Enemy Forces in Wusong and Baoshan Cut Off

Confirmed Information: The enemy forces in the Zhanghuabang, Wenzaobang, Wusong Town, and Paotaiwan areas along the river total no less than 5,000 men. Since being severely attacked by our troops, casualties have almost reached half. However, because enemy reinforcements have been continuously increasing, the enemy is still putting up stubborn resistance. The enemy in Baoshan some days ago came from Wusong via a roundabout route, relying on their reinforcements. However, our troops were prepared and gave them a head-on blow. The enemy was unable to withstand it and collapsed back to Wusong along the original route. Our troops took advantage of the victory to pursue, and by yesterday morning, it was learned that the enemy between Wusong Town and Paotaiwan had been surrounded by our troops on all sides. The enemy's communication line between Wusong and Baoshan has been cut off by us. At the same time, the remaining enemy forces along the Zhanghuabang and Wenzaobang rivers were also surrounded by us before dawn yesterday morning, cutting off the enemy's north-south communication lines (north to Wusong, south to Hujiang University). We are continuing to advance and pursue.

### Our Troops Hold Jing River in Luodian

Confirmed Information: In the Luodian area, the fighting between the two sides was extremely fierce on the day before (the 7th), with short-range engagements. There were six or seven bayonet and hand-to-hand combat charges. After several hours, although there were no changes in the positions, the casualties on both sides were extremely heavy. When the two sides were engaged in a bloody mixed battle, our certain battalion suddenly launched a fierce attack on the enemy at Changqiao from the XXZhai and XXZhai lines. As of yesterday morning, they were still confronting the enemy in that area near the Jing River. According to confirmed reports, the Shenjiawan Jiangzhai west head positions on the west side of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway have indeed been recovered by our troops. At that time, a unit of our troops flanked the enemy at Shuangcaodun, and the enemy collapsed towards the northeast. At the same time, our troops also dispatched a unit of reinforcements to attack towards the Chuansha River mouth. In this battle, the enemy suffered countless casualties. Our side lost five officers and more than sixty soldiers.

In the Luodian area, there was a fierce battle some days ago. In this battle, five junior officers and more than sixty soldiers of our army sacrificed their lives for the country, and the number of enemy casualties was even more than doubled. Yesterday, the enemy and we were in stalemate on both sides of the Jing River, and there were no changes in the front lines.

### Our Front Lines in Zhanghuabang Unchanged

The enemy forces in Zhanghuabang used aircraft and warships to launch a strong attack on us the night before, attempting to cover a large number of infantry troops to counterattack our army. At that time, the fighting was very fierce. The enemy forces once crossed the Nanchitang River. At the same time, the enemy forces also sent another unit to cross the river in two routes near Yantou Stone. Our front-line troops gave them a head-on blow, blocking their advance, and then transferred a large number of reinforcements from the rear, together with the original military strength, to launch a large-scale counterattack, advancing in a bloody battle. After several hours of fierce fighting, the enemy finally collapsed and retreated. Our troops still maintain the Nanchitang position.

The enemy in Zhanghuabang and Wenzaobang sneaked across the Nansitang River simultaneously in small rubber boats the day before, and were repelled by our troops. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. Yesterday, the enemy and we were still confronting each other across the river, and there were no changes in the front lines.

### Fierce Artillery Battles Between Enemy and Us Last Night

The enemy ships docked in the Huangpu River bombarded our Pudong again at 7:30 last night. The artillery positions in our Pudong immediately retaliated with heavy artillery. At the same time, the artillery positions in our Zhabei also opened fire and bombarded the enemy positions in Hongkou and Yangshupu. The enemy suffered heavy damage. The sound of artillery gradually subsided after about 30 minutes.

### Enemy Attacks in Zhabei Result in Heavy Casualties

The enemy forces in Zhabei have repeatedly harassed, and our side has already seen through their tricks and ignored them. When they thought they could take the opportunity to attack, our troops waited for them to approach before launching a sudden and heavy blow. The enemy forces were caught off guard and suffered heavy setbacks repeatedly. The enemy forces used the same old trick again the night before, but ultimately did not succeed and only suffered losses. In addition, the forces in the Yangshupu area are maintaining their original lines, and there have been no changes. After the enemy troops landing in Liuhe were repelled, there has been no movement in the past few days. In the Luodian area, our troops are still in strict encirclement.

According to the Central News Agency, the enemy forces who were stubbornly resisting in the Marine Corps barracks on North Sichuan Road launched an attack on our Baoshan Road this morning at 6:00 AM, taking cover under artillery fire. Our garrison calmly responded to the battle, and when they saw the enemy approaching, they swept them with machine guns and threw hand grenades from high places. The enemy forces repeatedly charged, but did not succeed and suffered heavy casualties. They quietly retreated at about 8:00 AM, and we did not pursue them.

### Our Air Force Attacks Enemy Positions

Enemy Positions Catch Fire and Suffer Heavy Damage / Enemy Ships Panic and Hastily Respond to the Battle

At 7:05 PM yesterday, two of our aircraft suddenly took off again in the fading twilight and flew towards the enemy positions in eastern Shanghai and the enemy ships in the Huangpu River to carry out bombing raids. At that time, our aircraft attacked in separate routes. One aircraft bombed and dropped ordnance on the Qujiang Wharf at the bottom of Yangshupu. One bomb exploded immediately, and the enemy forces, caught off guard, suffered heavy casualties. Another bomb hit the Minhua Sugar Factory, causing a fire to break out in a short time, which was very intense. It is said that the enemy forces had a large number of military supplies stored in the factory, which have all been reduced to ashes. At the same time, the other aircraft flew directly to the sky over the Huangpu River and bombed the enemy ships, dropping three bombs in succession, all of which were only a foot or so apart. The water waves splashed high for tens of feet. The enemy warships at the front were unaware until our aircraft dropped the first bomb, when they suddenly realized it. The ships hastily fired anti-aircraft guns into the sky, but our air force was unusually calm, ignoring the fire as if it were nothing, and continued to drop the second and third bombs. After completing their mission, they safely returned to their defense positions. However, at that time, the enemy warships' anti-aircraft guns fired like a string of pearls, firing no less than hundreds of shells, the sound of which shook far and wide. At about 0:40 this morning, a squadron of our air force took off in the dark, inspecting the enemy's movements along the Huangpu River to Songkou. However, the sound of our aircraft was low, and it was not discovered until it reached the enemy's warships. The enemy ships were thrown into great panic, and anti-aircraft guns, anti-aircraft machine guns, flares, signals, etc., created a sky full of stars, firing wildly and aimlessly. Before long, the sound of the aircraft faded away, and the enemy forces assumed that our aircraft had already passed. The guns and cannons also stopped, but unexpectedly, our air force had never left and remained hidden in the clouds. Waiting for the enemy to relax slightly, they suddenly came again, and the enemy ships on the river surface were thrown into turmoil. Our aircraft suddenly disappeared again. This happened several times, and the enemy ships were uneasy all night. It can be seen from the wasted ammunition and the cost that the enemy is deeply wary of the strong combat power of our air force.

### Japanese Planes Fire on the Taishan Steamer

[Guangzhou] According to returning guests from Hong Kong who were aboard the British merchant steamer Taishan, the ship was indeed fired upon by Japanese warships five times en route to the province on the 6th.

It still departed for the province at 8:30 AM. (8th Dispatch)

### Wang Jingwei Talks About National Salvation Bonds (Continued)

Therefore, our savings capacity cannot match that of any modern industrial country. However, with our more than 400 million people and our more than 4 million square miles of land, we must not underestimate ourselves. We must know that money is indeed money, but all goods are also money. This phenomenon is especially evident during wartime. The needs of the soldiers on the front lines and the needs of the people in the rear for sustenance and savings are, rather than being money for goods and coal, goods themselves. Except for a certain portion of military supplies that cannot but rely on money for purchase within a certain period, we have everything else. If reasonable control is implemented, we can surely supply them continuously without worrying about depletion. This idea has been revealed in the national salvation bond raising method. Article 3 clearly stipulates that the cash and goods raised are limited to the following types: ㊀ national currency or foreign currency, ㊁ raw gold and silver and other finished products, ㊂ negotiable securities (including domestic and foreign securities), ㊃ deposit slips, ㊄ real estate that is easy to liquidate, ㊅ goods and materials that can be liquidated at any time or directly applied. These regulations mean that in addition to money, all goods are also money, and all real estate and materials can be liquidated at any time and can also be directly applied. There used to be a popular saying that those with money should contribute money, and those with strength should contribute strength. Now we can add another sentence: those with strength should contribute strength, physical strength is also strength, and knowledge is also strength; those with money should contribute money, money is also money, and goods are also money. In this way, our path to national salvation is extraordinarily broad. We can say that all of our compatriots can buy national salvation bonds. I only have these few words to tell our compatriots about national salvation bonds: First, the enemy's invasion this time cannot be as effortless as before, and they must take out their capital. The more capital they take out, the easier their internal collapse and the easier the external invasion. The second sentence is that our resistance this time is prepared to completely exhaust the nation's mental and material strength. Taking out our capital is a matter of course, but the more capital we take out, the stronger our internal unity and the more hopeful our external assistance. In this way, all our compatriots are not only willing but also very happy to buy national salvation bonds, because this is fighting for the survival of the nation, and the result of this struggle is the survival of the nation. As for the repayment of principal and interest and the boundless profits, they are secondary. (6th Central News Agency) (End)

### Swiss Boy Angered by Japanese Aggression

Contributes All His Possessions to Help Our Military Expenses

[Geneva] A Swiss boy named Xuneida, who is only fourteen years old, recently contributed all his possessions, totaling twenty francs, to China to "purchase a machine gun" to resist Japanese aggression. He attached his donation to a letter to General Chiang Kai-shek, asking Hu Shize, the Chinese envoy to Switzerland, to convey it. Mr. Hu gladly agreed. Although Xuneida is still young, he has read several books about China and has always admired the Chinese people and culture. He also often pays attention to various developments in China in newspapers and is very interested. He has always longed to visit China in the future. The recent Japanese aggression against China has made him extremely angry, so he contributed all his savings to China to help resist the enemy. (8th Central News Agency)

### US Government Declares No Change in Far East Policy

The evacuation of overseas Chinese does not affect the fundamental policy. Still thinking of guaranteeing peace with Britain and France.

[Washington] Secretary of State Hull spoke to reporters today and declined to comment on a telegram from the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai requesting the government to clarify its Far East policy. However, he said that President Roosevelt's remarks on Block Island did not change the original policy of the US government. At the same time, officials were deeply dissatisfied with the rumors that the President's and Hull's remarks were inconsistent, because Hull only said that all overseas Chinese in Shanghai who are able to leave should go elsewhere as soon as possible. The US government has absolutely no intention of abandoning its rights and its overseas Chinese. The President's remarks did not indicate that the US Marine Corps should withdraw from Shanghai. Senior officials, in order to clarify the government's policy towards overseas Chinese, stated that the United States still intends to firmly maintain all its rights in China, but feels that the majority of overseas Chinese can be evacuated without conflicting with this policy in any way. The President does not advocate abandoning commerce in China, and his intention refers to the entire territory of China, not just Shanghai. The government cannot be responsible for the safety of overseas Chinese who are deep in the interior of China. Even those in Shanghai who are hit by stray bullets are difficult for the government to protect. The current situation in Shanghai is special. Although overseas Chinese have considerable protection, they also have considerable danger. Among them, there are quite a few who are willing to risk danger because they do not want to leave their relatives. However, those who generally serve in public utilities agencies are responsible for their duties, and should not leave lightly until all foreigners have to withdraw from Shanghai. (7th National Telegram)

[Washington] US officials recently stated that Secretary of State Hull issued a written statement on July 16, outlining the main principles for maintaining peace. The current US foreign policy is still guided by these principles, and there have been no changes in the Far East or other parts of the world. In short, regarding all international disputes, the US government has always hoped to resolve them peacefully and will do its best to persuade in order to achieve its goals and strive to avoid causing war. A senior official of the State Department recently stated, "The position adopted by the United States is fundamentally no different from the position of Britain and France. These countries are committed to the cause of peace, but they are unwilling to take any actions that could be considered provocative by other countries. All of this is the same as our country." According to Roosevelt's current avoidance of announcing that a state of war already exists between China and Japan, the reason is that the United States retains certain rights in China, which are determined by international treaties. This special situation is not covered by the Neutrality Act. If a state of war is now declared, the provisions of the Neutrality Act must be implemented, and the United States will inevitably abandon the above-mentioned rights. If so, it would be denying Hull's statement that existing international treaties should be respected, and would be subject to self-contradictory criticism. The State Department hopes that public opinion will understand this difficulty. Generally speaking, the State Department is now considering the difficult situation in which the United States and other peace-loving countries are in with a more realistic perspective, but it is also unwilling to be a pioneer of public opinion. (Central News Agency, 7th Havas Telegram)

[New York] The New York Times Washington dispatch reported that the State Department was very surprised to hear that the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai expressed panic after hearing the news that the US government was planning to withdraw its protection. Secretary of State Hull was unwilling to discuss the situation in detail, but said that there had been no change in US policy, nor was there any intention to change it. For protection, the government decided to maintain the current sailors stationed in Shanghai and dispatched a squadron of sailors from San Diego, California, to Shanghai to increase the strength of the troops stationed in Shanghai. Although President Roosevelt warned American overseas Chinese on Sunday that the government could not be responsible for staying in China, he simultaneously specifically stated that the army and navy troops and warships did not intend to withdraw at this time. As for the losses of American industries, the US government officially warned both China and Japan to bear responsibility for compensation. The compensation claim will be filed after the war ends. This is customary practice. The President's secretary stated today that the President did not want to criticize the request of the American overseas Chinese in Shanghai, and that all inquiries about this matter would be handled by the State Department. (Central News Agency, 8th Reuters)

Dalu Daily reported that the major American merchants in this city have decided to stay in Shanghai to protect their commercial interests, regardless of whether their government sponsors it or not, and will only be willing to leave Shanghai after the government makes another decision on an active policy. According to an investigation by Professor Li Mo of the University of Michigan, the total amount of American investment in China is US$155,112,778, making it the third largest investing country after Japan. Among them, those in Shanghai account for more than 60%. In addition, the property owned by American churches and charitable organizations in various parts of China also amounts to US$43,071,189, and the American people have purchased Chinese bonds, etc., amounting to US$41,711,346. The total of the three items is US$239,895,312. Furthermore, the private property owned by American overseas Chinese in Shanghai and other places is also huge and has not been included. Therefore, if the American people withdraw from China, all of these public and private properties cannot be protected. This is why the American overseas Chinese in this city are determined to firmly uphold their position, even if their personal safety is endangered, they will never abandon their interests and return to their country. Yesterday, when the spokesperson of the Chinese army met with news reporters, he also said that there is currently no need for the American overseas Chinese to leave Shanghai.

### Gu Weijun Goes to Geneva to Prepare to Attend the League of Nations

Hopes for US Cooperation to Stop Aggression. Gu's Wife Raises National Salvation Donations in Paris.

[Paris] Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun will depart for Geneva via Italy on Thursday to serve as the chief representative of China at the League of Nations Council meeting. He told Associated Press reporters today that if the United States can cooperate with the League of Nations in a timely manner, it will be able to prevent the expansion of the Sino-Japanese conflict in the Far East into a world war, and that if the United States can take such action, it will be celebrated by peace-loving countries around the world. Gu continued, what methods should be adopted under the League of Nations Covenant to limit Japan's aggressive actions and restore peace in the Far East? I am discussing this issue with the League of Nations. In short, the League of Nations must faithfully bear its inescapable obligations. The United States has always been a country that loves peace and opposes aggression, so if the United States can come forward to cooperate with the League of Nations, it will greatly influence world public opinion. Furthermore, all countries in the world are now entangled in issues related to their own vital interests, so their expectations for US cooperation are even more urgent. I still remember that after the September 18th Incident, although the United States was not a member of the League of Nations, it still cooperated closely with the League of Nations. For example, it first attended as an observer, then cooperated with the General Assembly, accepted the resolutions of the Lytton Investigation Team, and finally Gu expressed great interest in the opinions put forward by British and American experts to President Roosevelt as reported in today's newspaper. According to the opinions of these experts, if the United States can blockade the Panama Canal against Japan when Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant is implemented, and Britain can blockade Singapore against Japan, then Japan can be subdued in no more than four hours. (7th National Telegram)

[Geneva] The Geneva International Daily commented on the issue of the Chinese National Government appealing to the League of Nations regarding Japanese aggression from a rationale perspective, stating that it seems inappropriate for China to invoke Articles 10, 11, and 13 of the Covenant this time. Only Article 17 of the Covenant, or attaching Articles 10 and 13, is more appropriate. Article 17 of the Covenant stipulates the handling of disputes between member states and non-member states or between two non-member states. The newspaper continued that sanctions could be invoked when sanctions are implemented in the future, and according to the provisions of Article 17, paragraph 3, if Japan refuses to attend the League of Nations General Assembly, China will have sufficient reason to request the implementation of sanctions. (8th Central News Agency)

[Paris] The wife of Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to France, has now raised 26,000 francs, 161 gold pounds, and 500 US dollars here, which will be remitted to China for anti-Japanese military use. The donors are mostly American hotel owners and overseas Chinese and Americans in France. (7th National Telegram)

### Wang Zhengting Appeals to the United States

Relief to Our Refugees

[Washington] Wang Zhengting, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, declared today at a meeting with news reporters that the Japanese troops invading China were acting like robbers, and that China not only intended to repel these troops, but would also recover its lost territories. The ambassador made a formal appeal for the relief of the wounded and homeless refugees. The ambassador also said that China is willing to resolve all difficulties with Japan by any possible peaceful means, but will have to fight hard against the continued invasion of its territory. The ambassador concluded by saying that we deeply know that the China they are trying to conquer is only a small part of what Japanese soldiers dream of. They are thinking of creating a Pacific empire, which includes more than just China. If their wishes can be fulfilled, then all the land in the Pacific, the Philippines, Australia, and Hawaii, etc., will be included in their grasp. (Central News Agency, 7th Reuters)

[New York] Dr. Wang Zhengting, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, recently issued an appeal to the American people to donate money to help Chinese civilians who have been injured. Ambassador Wang also gave a speech to various newspapers stating that what Japan is doing now is to implement the plan proposed in Tanaka's Memorial in 1927 and to conquer the lands occupied or controlled by Western countries in the Far East. He also said that if Japan now stops its acts of aggression, China can still submit the relations between China and Japan for discussion or negotiate directly with Japan or through the League of Nations Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague, or be based on the Washington Nine-Power Treaty or the Paris Peace Pact. Finally, he said that China has no reason to formally declare war on Japan. (Central News Agency, 7th Havas Telegram)

### All News Agencies in Beijing Have Been Suspended

Not Allowed to Engage in External Activities

[Nanjing] The Central Propaganda Department issued a public notice on the 8th, stating that the Nanjing branch of the Dazhonghua News Agency, Dadao News Agency, China News Agency, China-Foreign News Agency, World News Agency, Guanghua News Agency, Duowen News Agency, Huazhong News Agency, Nanjing branch of the Dagong News Agency, Oriental News Agency, Jianguo News Agency, Shenzhou News Agency, Shishi News Agency, Shishi Telegraph News Agency Nanjing Branch, Zhizhong News Agency, New Northwest News Agency, Mengmao News Agency, Nanjing Border News Agency, Cheng Daily News Agency, and Daxia Evening News Agency, a total of 20 agencies, have all been suspended one after another. In addition, the Dalu News Agency had previously been ordered to change its name and apply for registration separately because its name was the same as that of the Dalu News Agency, which had already been deregistered. It is now found that it has also voluntarily suspended publication. All of these agencies should be ordered not to engage in external activities in any of their names before resuming publication. Furthermore, the Jiangnan News Agency, Xingzhong News Agency, Dacheng News Agency, Dasheng Daily News Agency, Jing Daily News Agency, and Nanjing Express News Agency, a total of six agencies, were issued and published without being approved for registration. It is now found that all of them have voluntarily suspended publication. The original application for registration of each of these agencies should be revoked, and they are not allowed to resume publication. In addition to sending separate letters to the Nanjing Special City Party Department, the Ministry of Interior will handle the matter separately. (8th Central News Agency)

### The Enemy Army Spends One Million Yuan Per Day on Ammunition in Shanghai Operations

Foreign Observers' Estimates Indicate Unfavorable Enemy Position

An Englishman who serves as a shipowner, Mr. X, who served as a naval officer during the European War and is now a captain in China, said that the Shanghai war has been going on for nearly a month. Japan has mobilized its army, navy, and air force to Shanghai, hoping to defeat the Chinese army in the shortest possible time. The Japanese, possessing a powerful navy, coupled with a large number of aircraft, are confident that the war can be quickly resolved. Unexpectedly, they encountered fierce resistance from the Chinese army. Although the Chinese army has suffered heavy losses, the Japanese army's losses are also almost equal to those of the Chinese army, which is truly beyond our expectations. It is estimated that there are already 120,000 Japanese army troops陆续調派to Shanghai. With such a large army, occupying a very narrow area, it has been unable to break through the Chinese army's encirclement line for more than ten days. Militarily, the Japanese army is already in a very unfavorable position. Even if some reinforcements arrive later, if the front line still cannot expand outward, it will only increase difficulties and offer few opportunities for development. We estimate that the Japanese army's operations have been uneconomical since the beginning of the war, especially the waste of ammunition, which is alarming. We roughly estimate that about 120 to 130 large and small warships and transport ships are concentrated in the Songhu area, accounting for more than half of the country's warships. The daily cost of coal, water, food, and supplies for the warships is at least 150,000 to 200,000 yuan. In addition, artillery fire is opened on the battlefield every day, regardless of accuracy, with some days seeing 1,000 to 2,000 shells fired. The ammunition expenditure is between 200,000 and 300,000 yuan. As for the bombs dropped by aircraft, an average of about 200 bombs are dropped per day, and the ammunition spent on anti-aircraft guns is also about 100,000 yuan per day. Furthermore, considering the army, the supply of 120,000 people and the feeding of warhorses, as well as the artillery fire on the battlefield, the daily expenditure is at least 350,000 to 400,000 yuan. This consumption, just in terms of military fire, already requires one million yuan per day. The various other expenditures are even more incalculable. The war has been going on for nearly a month now, and Japan's consumption of artillery fire will reach 30 million yuan. If this continues for a long time, will the costs of the navy, army, and air force not increase even further? As for the Chinese army, it cherishes artillery fire. Although we cannot estimate it, judging from the fact that the Japanese side fires ten or more shells while the Chinese army only responds with one or two, it is not difficult to imagine the difference in ammunition consumption between the two sides.

Current Commentary

### Measures to Deal with Enemy Atrocities

— Yu

Since the enemy army launched an unprovoked war and invaded our country's territory, although diplomatic relations between the two countries have not been officially severed, the enemy army has brutally killed our innocent people, bombed our cultural institutions, and blockaded our entire coastline. There is truly not a single means that is not illegal, unreasonable, and extremely vicious. For the sake of self-defense, for the sake of world justice, and for the sake of the future of resistance against the enemy, our country should adopt retaliatory measures against the enemy's atrocities under the conditions of international law, and strike the enemy.

According to international law, retaliatory measures can also be used to deal with unfriendly actions of other countries even before a war is declared. Retaliatory measures include Retorfions (retaliation in kind) and Reprisais (reprisals). The latter is especially appropriate to be carried out during this period. The so-called Reprisais are generally recognized by modern publicists, and the methods are roughly as follows: (1) Seizing the enemy country's public and private property within our country without compensation; (2) Suspending trade; (3) Expelling all enemy nationals from the country; (4) Abolishing all treaties concluded with the enemy country; (5) Declaring the revocation of special rights or preferential treatment enjoyed by enemy nationals; (6) Suspending the payment of interest on foreign debts owed to the enemy country, etc. All of these Reprisais actions are effective measures that we can currently adopt. Speaking of the first item, enemy investment is spread throughout China. Except for Tianjin, Beiping, and the eastern two provinces, which are under Japanese control and we cannot implement these measures, we should immediately confiscate or seize other investments, such as 125 million yen of investment in Shanghai, 100 million yen in various parts of Shandong, and several million yen in Hankou and various parts of South China, to the extent that we are able to do so. As for the first and second items, they are not practically problematic. As for the fifth and sixth items, we can take advantage of this period to implement them as soon as possible, so as to fundamentally invalidate all unequal treaties with the enemy country in the past.

Under normal circumstances, the purpose of requesting Reprisais is only to urge the other party to reflect and change its unfriendly actions. Of course, the current enemy is still harboring the delusion of making us 'kneel'. They will never reflect on our adoption of Reprisais actions. However, the enemy's atrocities against us are becoming increasingly serious. Now they are even disregarding the rights of neutral countries and indiscriminately searching the ships of third countries. At this time, in addition to military action, it is truly necessary to retaliate against them with a major blow without any scruples.

### British Cabinet Holds First Plenary Session After Summer Vacation

Official Awaits Formal Reply from Japan; Public Opinion Criticizes Japan for Lost Reputation

[London] Today's cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Chamberlain, was the first plenary session since July. Many issues were discussed, including the Mediterranean talks, the Far East issue, the procedures for the League of Nations meeting in Geneva, and Japan's interim reply regarding the incident of Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen's injury. (8th Central News Agency Reuter dispatch)

[London] All cabinet members staying in London will attend today's cabinet meeting. The meeting will focus on considering the overall situation in the Mediterranean and the Far East. Prime Minister Chamberlain returned to London from Scotland yesterday to attend the cabinet meeting. After returning to London, the Prime Minister held talks with several cabinet members, including Foreign Secretary Eden and Colonial Secretary Malcolm MacDonald. (8th Central News Agency Reuter dispatch)

[London] Although the Japanese government has sent an interim reply to the British government regarding the injury of British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British authorities will not express their views until they receive the final reply from the Japanese government. It is expected that the final reply will not be delayed for too long. However, it is heard that if the interim reply is the final word of the Japanese government, the British government will definitely not consider it satisfactory. (8th Central News Agency Reuter dispatch)

[London] The British cabinet will discuss tomorrow the 'interim' reply submitted by the Japanese government regarding the case of the attack on British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. British officials are extremely disappointed with this reply and believe that if the content of the official Japanese reply is no different from the interim reply, Britain will definitely express its dissatisfaction with Japan and will provide proof thereof. It is generally understood that the British cabinet will now continue to wait quietly for a week, but some left-leaning cabinet members advocate further negotiations with the Tokyo government to urge it to send the official reply as soon as possible. (7th Central News Agency Havas dispatch)

[London] The Times said in an editorial today that the future of British and other neutral countries' interests in the Far East is indeed bleak, like in the dead of winter. This biting cold has not been softened by the Japanese Navy Ministry's discussion of not interfering in the peaceful nature of commerce. In addition, there is a more urgent issue that the British cabinet should address, namely the Japanese government's interim reply to the British note. The British note demanded that the Japanese government provide full compensation for the injury to the British ambassador by a Japanese aircraft. The conclusion of the Japanese reply expresses the hope that the British authorities should notify the Japanese authorities in advance when entering dangerous areas so as to cooperate with the local Japanese authorities. This conclusion has broad and strange implications. Generally speaking, we can say that if it were not an interim reply, it would not have been satisfactory at all. (8th Central News Agency Reuter dispatch)

[London] The Daily Herald said in an article today that Japan had a reputation in the past, but it has gradually lost it. The Japanese government admitted that its officers injured the ambassador of a friendly country without any reason. In this situation, it is difficult to be in this position, but if you try to escape the difficulty with false words, it is like a cowardly schoolboy who commits a crime and makes an excuse. Its possible answer is 'Sir, I didn't do it.' This is truly despicable and shameless. (8th Central News Agency Reuter dispatch)

[London] The Financial Times today published a prominent article on the crisis of British interests in Chinese commerce, saying that if we are afraid of getting into trouble with Japan and let it carry out a thorough naval blockade, then we are actually helping to disintegrate the Chinese administrative organization, and what the Japanese, represented by warlords and industrial giants, want is a China that is forever under Japan's control, conforming to Japan's strategic economic ideals, and generating monetary gains for Japan's extensive and cheap goods.

[London] The Japanese blockade of the Chinese coast is currently under active consideration by the British government. The British government now deeply feels that Japan has no intention of interfering with British shipping. (8th Central News Agency Reuter dispatch)

### New York Securities Plunge Across the Board

Metallurgical Securities Are Especially Unfavorable

[New York] The situation in the Near East and Europe is currently unstable, and the New York Stock Exchange market is affected. Various stocks have fallen by three to twelve points, and have reached the lowest market price of the year.

### Mediterranean Conference to Open Tomorrow

British Foreign Secretary Eden to Be Elected Chairman; Soviet Russia Lodges Second Protest with Italy

[Geneva] The Mediterranean Conference is scheduled to hold its first meeting at 4:30 p.m. on Friday, the 10th, in the Nyon Town Hall. British Foreign Secretary Eden is likely to be elected chairman. As for the League of Nations Council meeting, it is scheduled to open in Geneva at 11:00 a.m. on the same day. (8th Central News Agency Havas)

[Rome] After Britain and France issued invitations yesterday regarding the Mediterranean Conference, the Italian government is currently consulting with the German government on whether to participate. Semi-official sources here recently stated that the note submitted by the Soviet Union yesterday has created a delicate situation. (7th Central News Agency Havas dispatch)

[Rome] This morning at 10:00 a.m., Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Gelfand delivered the first note regarding the sinking of a Soviet ship by a submarine to Foreign Minister Count Ciano. The note declared that the Soviet government considered the Italian government's reply to the first Soviet note unsatisfactory. The Soviet government now maintains its accusations against Italy and defends its original position. The Italian government immediately began to study this note after receiving it. (8th Central News Agency Havas dispatch)

[Moscow] The Soviet Union protested to Italy over the attack on a Mediterranean merchant ship by a submarine. Italy has already replied. The government stated today that the Soviet Union considered Italy's reply unsatisfactory, so it will demand compensation for losses and punishment of those responsible. It is thus possible that Moscow will file another protest. At the same time, the Soviet Union stated regarding the 12-nation Mediterranean conference that if other countries want the Soviet Union to attend, they must first recognize that the situation in the Mediterranean was created by Italy alone. This statement has already caused the conference to be foretold to fail. It is claimed that the Soviet Union can provide concrete evidence proving that the submarines that attacked the merchant ships of various countries were Italian submarines. At that time, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov may announce this evidence, so that countries will have no choice but to discuss the issue of Italy's responsibility. The Soviet Union has replied to the British and French ambassadors regarding the invitation to attend the conference, expressing its acceptance, but requesting that Germany should not participate, and that the Spanish government should be invited, because Germany is not a Mediterranean country. (8th National Dispatch)

[London] Britain and France, angered by the frequent attacks on merchant ships in the Mediterranean, have decided today to jointly use their navies, if necessary, to stop the threat of submarines. Even if Russia, Germany, and Italy disagree at the Mediterranean conference on Friday, they will try to get other countries to agree. Britain and France deeply feel that after the naval forces of the two countries are united, they can be free from attacks by other countries in the Mediterranean. Although Britain does not want to formally announce cooperation with France, it also believes that piracy-style actions must be stopped. It is reported that Britain will ask countries to support the anti-submarine plan already agreed upon by Britain and France. If other countries are willing to cooperate with Britain and France, they can implement it. (7th National Dispatch)

### Work of Russian Border Guards in the Last Ten Years

Detained a Total of 10,000 Spies; Conscription Begins in Kiev This Month

[Moscow] Pravda published an article detailing the work of the Soviet border guards, including some very interesting materials. Over the past ten years, the border troops under the Internal Affairs Committee have detained approximately 10,000 spies and accomplices, and have crushed dozens of bandits on the border, eliminating hundreds of bandit armies and special forces. In the Far East region alone, more than 150 White Russian bandit armies have been eliminated. In the past year and a half, a total of 394 border guards have been awarded medals of various levels for their heroic achievements, including 116 who received the Lenin Medal and the Red Banner of Labor Medal. In the past sixteen months, the border troops have detained 562 foreign spies. Pravda concluded by saying, 'The achievements of our border guards can foresee the amazing heroism that hundreds of millions of Soviet patriots will show when the enemy forces our people to arm themselves in self-defense.'

### Soviet Union Detains Japanese Gunboat

Sixteen Japanese and Korean People Aboard

[Moscow] A report from Poli states that on the 5th of this month, the Soviet border fleet detained a Japanese armed patrol boat named 'Osaka Maru'. The vessel, of approximately 150 tons, was detained while anchored in Soviet territorial waters, between Frueholm Island and the mouth of the Tyumen-Ula River, two and a quarter miles from shore. One machine gun, rifles, handguns, ammunition, etc. were found on board. During the initial interrogation of the captain, the translator stated that the ship was sent by the Governor-General of Korea in order to monitor the activities of Korean fishermen and to prevent them from entering Soviet territorial waters. This statement is obviously inconsistent with the facts, since there were dozens of Japanese and Korean fishing boats anchored at the place where the Osaka Maru was anchored, closer to the Soviet coast than the ship. This year, Japanese fishing boats have frequently entered Soviet territorial waters in large numbers, and most of the places they go to are not suitable for fishing. This fact is noteworthy, because the purpose of these Japanese fishing boats entering Soviet territory is clearly not for fishing. The Soviet Union has now detained several fishing boats for investigation, and the captains will be sent to court for trial later. (8th TASS dispatch)

He immediately took the destroyer "Gallant One" north that evening and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow afternoon to assume his duties as Acting Chargé d'Affaires. The acting period will last until Ambassador Xu recovers.

### Declaration of the China Taiwan Revolutionary Party

According to the Central News Agency, Taiwan has been lost for more than forty years. Millions of Chinese descendants are suffering under the brutal rule of the Japanese. People of ambition have raised the banner of righteousness and led the revolution. For decades, they have repeatedly stumbled and risen, never ceasing to fight. Now, the New York-based China Taiwan Revolutionary Party issued a declaration yesterday, the original text of which is as follows: In the Jiawu War, the Qing Dynasty was defeated and sought peace by ceding land. As a result, our Taiwan fell under the iron hooves of the brutal Japanese. Millions of compatriots were subjected to destruction, more brutal than tigers, with wailing everywhere and people unable to live. Alas, it is tragic! A dignified Chinese race is being harmed by foreigners, and refined attire and customs are being controlled by barbarians. How can we not feel heartbroken? People of ambition shouted loudly for the liberation of the nation and raised the banner of righteousness. However, due to the lack of support and exhaustion of strength, they repeatedly rose and stumbled, ultimately failing to succeed. Our compatriots have suffered and can no longer endure it. We, recognizing the sanctity of national freedom, the natural right to exercise civil rights, and the equitable distribution of people's livelihood, follow in the footsteps of our predecessors to eliminate the rule of the brutal Japanese imperialism, recover the lost territory, and free more than four million compatriots from the yoke of slaves. We seek revenge and restore the lost territory and governance to the motherland, restore the freedom of the nation, and display the bright and splendid dawn when we meet with our compatriots in our motherland. We express our innermost thoughts and hope that all our Chinese compatriots will understand.

### Rumors of Mass Relocation in Nanshi Are All Fabricated by Traitors

Police Bureau Has Arrested Several Perpetrators for Severe Punishment

For days, rumors have spread in Nanshi that the inspection authorities advised residents to temporarily relocate within three days. The rumors originated in the area of the Great and Small South Gates and the Lujiabang South Wharf. As a result, residents spread the rumors and moved away one after another. The pitiful fleeing crowds could not bring their clothes, packages, and utensils into the concession iron gates and walked out empty-handed to stay temporarily in hotels, suffering unbearable losses. As a result, Nanshi residents have left ten homes empty out of nine. The Municipal Police Bureau has been strictly investigating the origin of the rumors and has arrested several perpetrators who spread the rumors, who will be severely punished according to the law. A reporter inquired of a certain public official yesterday, who claimed that a few days ago, war refugees, in addition to fleeing to the concessions, mostly resided in Nanshi. At that time, the police force was focused on military affairs, so they did not have time to pay attention to and register the changes. Bloodthirsty traitors took advantage of the name of the refugees to live in Nanshi. Therefore, the police officers notified the landlords that all civilians who had moved from elsewhere, whether relatives or friends, should immediately report and register with reliable guarantees. Without guarantees, they would be required to leave within three days; otherwise, if suspected of being traitors, the second landlord would be held jointly liable, etc. A group of bandits, knowing that civilians' movable property was not allowed to be moved to the concessions, spread rumors so they could steal at night, and several cases have already occurred and have been handled. Now, they have been ordered to investigate the rumors and severely punish the perpetrators.

### Zhang Zhizhong's Reply to the Chamber of Commerce

Pledging Utmost Loyalty to Defend Our Territory

Zhang Zhizhong, Commander of the Nanjing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, telegraphed a reply to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, saying: "Your esteemed telegram has been received. Zhizhong is honored to accept the order to attack the Japanese invaders. I pledge my utmost loyalty to defend our territory. I am deeply moved and encouraged by your congratulations. I send this telegram to express my gratitude. I hope you will understand. Zhang Zhizhong bows with respect."

### Many Drawbacks and Few Benefits of Issuing Circulating Notes

Observations from Economic Experts

According to the Xin Xin News Agency, since the Ministry of Finance announced the measures to stabilize finances and approved the four supplementary measures of the Shanghai Silver and Money Trade Association, industries and businesses have gradually stabilized and achieved remarkable results. To increase market chips, organizations such as the Silk and Satin Trade Association have requested the issuance of commercial bills and circulating notes, which have been disapproved by the financial authorities. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency consulted economic experts on this issue. According to them, since the implementation of the currency reform policy in our country, the financial foundation has been solidified by the unified implementation nationwide. The Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China issue legal tender, and the reserves are guaranteed in accordance with the regulations. Therefore, the credit of legal tender is very solid. Recently, with the outbreak of the anti-Japanese war, the financial authorities immediately announced measures to stabilize finances and stabilize the market. On the one hand, the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China formed a joint discount and loan committee, set broad measures, accepted mortgages for loans as much as possible, and opened up inland discounts and loans to facilitate small loans and pawnshop deposits. This is a necessary facility for normal wartime finance. Its task is to protect financial institutions, conserve individual consumption, limit soaring prices, and prevent capital flight, and it is already gradually taking effect. There is no shortage of chips. As for issuing circulating notes, it is more harmful than beneficial. Its content is quite complicated. To put it simply, the result will be to undermine the stable and solid currency system policy. The prices of various commodities will inevitably change, so its impact on people's livelihood is extremely significant and must not be implemented. In fact, it is not necessary.

### Gas Pipe Explosion at the Water and Electricity Company

Situation Not Serious, Only an Elderly Woman Injured

According to the Central News Agency, at 11:50 AM yesterday, a loud explosion occurred at the Shanghai Water and Electricity Company on Yu Qiaqing Road in this city. At the time, the general public mistakenly thought that a shell had fallen into the concession. Later, according to reporters' inquiries, it was learned that it was due to the automatic rupture of a gas pipe inside the company. The cause of the explosion is currently unknown, and the company is investigating. It is reported that the company did not suffer any major losses. In addition to the damaged gas pipe being repaired and replaced with a new pipe, only two gas meters were damaged. No employees of the company were injured, and only one elderly woman was lightly injured in the face by flying debris.

### Jiangxi Provincial Government Remits 10,000 Yuan to Relieve Refugees

Shaanxi Provincial Government Actively Fundraises

The Joint Disaster Relief Association of various charitable organizations and the War Zone Refugee Relief Committee stated that the number of war zone refugees they have accommodated since the outbreak of the war often exceeds tens of thousands, requiring huge expenses. In addition to local planning, the committee has telegraphed various provincial and municipal governments to find ways to fundraise for relief. It has been learned that the Jiangxi Provincial Government has donated 10,000 yuan and remitted it to the committee to handle refugee affairs. In addition, the Shaanxi Provincial Government has also telegraphed a reply to the committee, stating that they are actively fundraising. As autumn is approaching and the weather is turning cold, refugees lack clothing, and it is hoped that people from all walks of life will continuously donate.

### National Salvation Donations Can Be Exchanged for Bonds

National Salvation Donations Will Soon Cease Collection; Please Exchange Temporary Receipts Promptly

According to the person in charge of the Anti-Enemy Support Association of All Circles, Guan Zhong, regarding National Salvation Donations: ㊀ According to the report on September 6, the association has collected a total of 1,119,173.59 yuan, savings passbooks of 11,182.67 yuan, securities of 252,465.20 yuan, and silver coins of 3,961 yuan. ㊁ The Ministry of Finance's issuance of National Salvation Bonds was originally proposed by the association. To concentrate efforts, the association will stop collecting National Salvation Donations from the 10th of this month. However, the association will still assist the government in recruiting National Salvation Bonds. ㊂ The National Salvation Donations collected by the association, in addition to being submitted to Chairman Chiang, were telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that donors be allowed to exchange National Salvation Donation receipts for National Salvation Bonds. The Ministry of Finance has replied by telegram approving the exchange. The telegram reads: "To the Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association of All Circles, the East telegram is received. The amount of National Salvation Donations you have raised is approaching one million, which shows that fundraisers and donors are all enthusiastic patriots and are worthy of commendation. Your request to exchange for National Salvation Bonds should be approved. Please contact the Fundraising Committee directly in addition to the letter. Special release, Ministry of Finance." The exchange procedures are being coordinated by Du Yuesheng, Director of the Fundraising Committee, and the Fundraising Association. ㊃ Before the official National Salvation Donation receipts were used, temporary receipts were printed and issued by the receiving agencies. A very small number of donors may not have exchanged the temporary receipts for official receipts. It is hoped that they will exchange them promptly with the original paying agencies to exchange them for National Salvation Bonds in the future.

### Garrison Headquarters Executes Traitor

### Xinheng Shelter Solicits Clothing, Bedding, and Food

The Xinheng Shelter and the Yiyuan Shelter have a total of more than 4,000 refugees. Due to the cold weather, there is an urgent need for clothing, quilts, food, and other items. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will donate generously, and the merit will be immeasurable. Please send all items to the Xinting Refugee Shelter, opposite the Great Light Theater at the intersection of Baek Road and Park Road.

### Postal Administration Bravely Handles Postal Services in the War Zone of Hongkou

Never Entrusted Any Japanese Organization to Deliver

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, postal services in the Hongkou district have also been disrupted. Our postal authorities, concerned about the Chinese and Japanese residents in the area, are still seeking a temporary solution in very difficult circumstances so that residents in the area will not have to stop receiving and sending mail. According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Postal Administration, since the outbreak of the 813 Shanghai War, the Japanese army has declared strict alert in the Hongkou district, preventing all pedestrians from coming and going freely. As a result, the staff of the Dongyouheng Road Post Office in the Hongkou district were also prevented from reaching the bureau and were unable to perform their duties. The Administration authorities expressed great concern about the residents of the area receiving and sending mail. Although they knew the difficulty of the situation, in order to avoid all kinds of troubles and to prevent postal services from being suspended in the area, they sent Japanese Deputy Postmaster General Kanezashi Kin'ichiro to be responsible for the bureau's business. Every morning, the Deputy Postmaster General led two staff members and one driver in a car to work at the bureau, and every evening they took the mail collected by the bureau to the Administration as usual for delivery. The postal authorities' spirit of service, which is not afraid of difficulties, is often admired by the general public, and is especially appreciated by all Chinese and Japanese residents in the area. The reporter asked whether the report in the Osaka Asahi Shimbun on September 1 that the Dongyouheng Road Post Office would entrust the postal delivery of mail to foreign countries to the Situation Committee organized by the Japanese side was accurate. The spokesperson denied the above-mentioned entrustment. According to him, the Administration has never entrusted anyone who is not related to the post office to handle the receiving and sending of mail. If the Japanese people's actions are true, they are obviously damaging the integrity of our country's postal service. The spokesperson solemnly stated that no matter how difficult the situation, the postal authorities will do their best to facilitate the delivery of civilian mail.

### Recent Work of the Professional Women's Association During the War

Since the Shanghai Chinese Professional Women's Association began its anti-Japanese activities in Shanghai on August 13, it has established a wartime work committee to engage in conscription, rescue, comfort, refugee relief, village mutual assistance, propaganda, investigation, and other work. Currently, the rescue group runs elementary and advanced rescue training classes, with more than 100 students. Many people have been sent to work at the Red Cross Hospital for Wounded Soldiers No. 2 and other places. The conscription group has also protected a large number of medicines and old clothes, which have been sent to various hospitals for wounded soldiers and refugee shelters for use. They have also raised funds to purchase cloth, which is used by the comfort and relief group to make clothes for wounded soldiers, and have made comfort bags and gas masks for the comfort branch. They are working very hard. Yesterday, the comfort group brought old clothes, towels, biscuits, medicines, etc. to the August 1st Refugee Ranch. They dispersed refugees, and the Yifu group has joined the Refugee Children's Education Service Corps and is stepping up preparations for national salvation dramas and songs to set off for propaganda at any time.

### Wanguo Shangtuan Chinese Team Soliciting Standing Team Members

The Chinese Team Association of the Wanguo Shangtuan of the Municipal Public Concession of this city yesterday issued a notice to all circles regarding the matter of adding standing team members. The association stated that since its establishment, it has been more than a year, and the current satisfactory achievements depend on the past achievements of the advanced members and the continued efforts of the later members. Since the January 28th Shanghai War, the municipal authorities, to expand the number of members and increase strength, have reorganized the entire country and divided it into battalions. The original proposal for the Chinese battalion is also in the plan. The entire battalion is divided into four teams. Currently, the first team has been compiled, but only one standing team is not yet complete. The team members practice square steps at noon, and it is easier to go out for defense work, but they must have a satisfactory certificate of more than three years to be qualified. Therefore, if any reserve members are interested in joining, regardless of age, they can report to the association office on Sanma Road to join the team, so as to increase the original number of personnel in the team and help with various easy tasks during the current defense. Once the situation improves in the future, when the authorities reiterate the original proposal, it will be easier to achieve the hope of completing the entire standing team.

### Students Studying in the United States Depart for Hong Kong to Transfer to the United States

A large number of students going abroad this year have been scheduled to depart today.

### Chaozhou Fellow Villagers Donate Medicines to North China

Many Fighting Troops in North China Desperately Need Full Relief from All Walks of Life

The Sino-Japanese War in North China is extremely fierce, and our front-line soldiers are fighting bravely against the enemy, and there are also heroic sacrifices. However, due to environmental factors, the rescue and medical supplies for the wounded soldiers are very lacking. It is reported that the Chaozhou Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai recently donated 15 boxes of various first-aid medicines to the 29th Army's office in Shanghai, which will be sent to the front line for application by the office within a few days. According to reports, there are many fighting troops on the Tianjin-Pukou, Beijing-Hankou, and Beijing-Ping lines, and it is hoped that the rear people can fully provide medical supplies.

### Urgently Seeking Practical Rescue Supplies

Hope All Circles Will Donate Actively

The Municipal Rescue Committee urgently needs ㊀ Cars, trucks, vans, ㊁ Practical items, blankets, tarpaulins, towels, gasoline, ㊂ Sanitary materials, gauze, cotton, bandage cloth, rubber cloth plaster, No. 2 and No. 3 tube-packed catgut sutures, and anesthetic chloroform. It is hoped that people from all walks of life who are willing to do what is right will actively donate to facilitate rescue.

The number of people going to and from the battlefield has not stopped in recent days, resulting in the occasional occurrence of cold and fever. To protect the front-line soldiers and prevent them, there is an urgent need for a large number of quinine medicines. It is still hoped that people from all walks of life who love the country will purchase and send them so that they can be transferred to the front to be used by the patriotic soldiers. In addition, a six-seater van is urgently needed. I also hope to donate generously. Please send the above two items to the Shanghai Local Association for transfer.

After Our Army Outflanked and Counterattacked from the Left and Right Wings, the Enemy Suffered Heavy Casualties and Retreated to Jungong Road to Reorganize. Last Night, Our Army Ordered a Full-Scale Offensive Against the Enemy, Charging and Engaging in Hand-to-Hand Combat. The Enemy, Unable to Withstand the Attack, Collapsed and Retreated to the Riverside. This Morning, Before Dawn, the Enemy, Relying on the Power of Enemy Warships, Aircraft, Artillery Fire, and Bombs, Attacked Our Forces Again. Their Advance Troops Reached the Vicinity of Chunjiang Road. Our Army Launched a Fierce Attack and Cleared the Enemy from Chunjiang Road. Currently, the Enemy and Our Forces are Confronting Each Other on Both Sides of the Qiujiang River. ㊁ The Stubborn Enemy in Luodian, Surrounded on Three Sides by Our Forces, Has Repeatedly Tried to Break Through Unsuccessfully. Last Night, Our Army Advanced Fiercely on Two Routes. One Route Reached Changqiao, Two Kilometers North of Luodian, and the Other Route Advanced from the Side to Fengjiazhai Wujiaqiao, One Kilometer North of Changqiao. ㊂ Yuepu Town Has Always Been Heavily Guarded by Our Forces. The Enemy Attempted Several Raids from Baoshan but Were Repelled Each Time. ㊃ In the Caojiazhai Area of the Yunzaobang, Artillery Battles Were Fierce This Morning.

Their Initial Intention Was to Attempt to Advance into Jiading to Develop the Sang Line, but Unexpectedly, They Were Fiercely Resisted by Our Army and Surrounded on Three Sides by Our Central Route and Left and Right Wings. They Are at a Loss for What to Do and Are in a Difficult Situation. Our Side Must Completely Eliminate the Remaining Enemy Before We Stop. ㊁ Although Baoshan County Seat Was Occupied by the Enemy, It Has No Great Strategic Significance Because Our Elite Troops Are Holding Firmly Less Than One Mile Outside the City, and the Right Wing Has Advanced to the Vicinity of Paotaiwan.

Our Army Has Cut Off This Line and Can Easily Control the Enemy's Fate. ㊂ Yuepu Town is Located Between Baoshan and Luodian and is a Thoroughfare Connecting the Two Places.

### The Enemy Advances Along Jungong Road Towards Our Forces

The enemy at the Qiujiang Wharf had designs on attacking our army's positions in the downtown area. Under the intense artillery fire of enemy warships and the charges of armored vehicles, their momentum was very rampant. Starting yesterday morning, our defending troops bravely launched a fierce attack, engaging in bloody hand-to-hand combat for a whole day and night, finally suppressing the enemy and forcing them to retreat towards Jungong Road. At the same time, a certain unit of our army advanced from the side along Wuquan Road, and the two sides夹击 (attacked from both sides). The enemy was still resisting stubbornly. At 5:00 AM this morning, enemy warships in the Huangpu River frequently attacked our positions in the downtown area. At the same time, a small group of enemy troops, estimated to be about four to five hundred, used five tanks to advance towards our army from Jungong Road, Guanyintang, and other places. At 7:00 AM this morning, the enemy's outposts reached the vicinity of Chunjiang Road, behind Lujia Guanyintang. Our defending troops of the □ brigade calmly responded to the battle, and when they were close, they rushed out of Yangjiazhai and launched a fierce attack on the enemy. Under the strafing of our machine guns, the hand grenades and mortar attacks, the stubborn enemy suffered heavy casualties, with few survivors.

The enemy who attacked the southern end of Zhoujiazhai last night has already been completely cleared by our army. Only a few remnants of the enemy remain in the direction of Heicunzhai and Shenjiazhai. In this battle, the enemy who were killed by our forces reached eight to nine hundred.

After 7:00 AM this morning, enemy troops were abnormally active in the direction of Wangjiazhai, and there were signs of moving in that direction, attempting to cross the river east of the Qiujiang Bridge. Our defending troops in that direction have been fully vigilant. At the same time, the Qiujiang Bridge has been destroyed by us, and it is difficult for the enemy to succeed. This morning, the downtown area and our left-wing positions were still engaged in heavy artillery duels. Currently, the enemy and our two armies are confronting each other on both banks of the Qiujiang River.

From 8:00 AM, the enemy at the Qiujiang Wharf launched a full-scale attack on our army's positions, but our army relied on a solid front to counterattack. As a result, although the enemy used heavy bombs and aircraft cover, they ultimately failed and retreated to their original positions. The battle continued until 8:30 PM. When the enemy was building defensive fortifications, the Guanjun took advantage of their unpreparedness and launched a valiant charge. At first, the enemy still asked our army for the "password," and our soldiers shouted, "Kill you!" The enemy was caught off guard and retreated in panic. The enemy suffered very heavy losses in this battle. This morning, before dawn, the enemy attempted to counterattack again but was repelled by us. At around 8:00 AM, our army also launched a brave counterattack, which was extremely fierce. The enemy suffered casualties of about several hundred people, and our side also inevitably suffered glorious sacrifices. As of the time of publication, the two sides are still engaged in fierce fighting. It is confirmed that our army has approached the riverside.

### Our Army Recaptures Key Areas in Luodian

We Advance Bravely Under Artillery Fire

On the Luodian front, after several days of fierce fighting, our army advanced very quickly. Our □ unit that attacked the enemy at Changqiao, after several charges and hand-to-hand combats last night, advanced bravely despite the enemy's intense artillery fire and recaptured Changqiao. It also advanced two kilometers north of Changqiao and completely recaptured key areas such as Wujiaqiao, Tanshiqiao, and Xiaojintang. At first, the enemy still tried to resist stubbornly, but under our army's fierce attack, they finally collapsed and retreated in a panic, abandoning countless guns and bullets. On the other hand, our army crossed the highway and advanced to Fengjiazhai, one kilometer north of Changqiao, echoing our army in the Wujiaqiao area and completing the connection. In the battle to recapture Changqiao last night, due to the brave advance of our army, one company commander, two platoon leaders, and a total of more than 160 soldiers were killed in action. The retreating enemy abandoned corpses all over the ground. The number of enemy annihilated should be more than seven or eight hundred.

### The Enemy Builds a Highway North of Luodian

Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Jiading. North of Luodian, the enemy has long built a motor road from Laomiao, northeast of Zhaoxing, to Xiaochuansha. In recent days, it has also extended the construction northwest from Laomiao, passing through Panjiaqiao and reaching Dingjiacun in Caowangmiao, and setting up an agency in Dingjiacun, seemingly attempting to advance westward. Our army is waiting in strict formation and will give them a head-on blow. The total length of this road is about ten kilometers. The construction is all done by local farmers, who are neatly arranged after the completion of the work and then annihilated by machine-gun fire in order to silence them. According to refugees who escaped from Xiaochuansha, a certain Wang, northeast of the grocery store, once served as an employee of a Japanese trading company and was the chairman of the local maintenance association when the area fell during the January 28 Incident. He willingly allowed himself to be used by the enemy. After the Shanghai War Agreement was concluded, he followed the enemy to Japan. This time, he came to Luodian again and became even more mad and frenzied, acting as a major traitor. Because he knew the local rivers and roads well, he assisted the enemy in designing their landing and invasion. Recently, he has gradually fortified defenses and stubbornly held on.

### Our Heroic Sacrifice in Baoshan City

This Kind of Spirit of Working to the Death for the Country is Enough to Show the Greatness of the National Soul

According to refugees who escaped from Baoshan City, from the 5th, the enemy used more than 30 warships and intense artillery fire to attack Baoshan City fiercely. At the same time, they used more than 10 tanks to cover the advance of the troops. Our army guarding the city □ battalion, under the bombs and artillery fire, was brave and unyielding. Even though they were surrounded, they still held firm in isolation and fought a bloody battle with the enemy for three days and nights. After our reinforcements arrived, it was a pity that the isolated army defending the city suffered too many casualties, and a part of the city wall had been destroyed by the enemy. By the evening of the 7th, the entire battalion of defending troops made a heroic sacrifice in fierce hand-to-hand combat. This kind of spirit of working to the death for the country is enough to show the greatness of our Chinese soul. It is enough for the people of the whole country to pay their respects. With this spirit, the final victory will surely belong to us.

### Fierce Fighting at Yunzaobang Yesterday

We Have Advanced to the Vicinity of Caojiazhai

On the Yunhua River, the fighting was fierce last night. Our right wing □ division has advanced to the vicinity of Caojiazhai in Yunzaobang, where extremely fierce bloody battles have taken place.

A Shout of Slaughter from Our Army. Telegrams Frequently Transmit Good News.

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) This newspaper's reporter went to the front line at Jiangwan □ at 7:00 PM last night to inspect. At that time, the two sides were engaged in fierce fighting, and the sound of guns and cannons was deafening. The reporter accompanied the □ commander to our army's first trench. All that could be heard was a shout of slaughter from our army. Bullets flew over the reporter's head. The reporter's blood was boiling, and he forgot the danger. Before long, a phone call came, saying that the enemy had collapsed and fled. The reporter lay in the trench for nearly an hour, then followed the □ commander to the □ headquarters to discuss the war and stayed overnight. This afternoon, he returned to the newspaper to report.

### The Enemy Attacks the Patriotic Girls' School Three Times

We Fiercely Repel the Enemy and Take the Opportunity to Advance, Seizing More Advantageous Positions

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The advantageous front lines seized by our army in Hongkou and Zhabei have recently, due to the focus of the war overflowing to the river defense, generally seem like deep trenches and high walls, with a firm and clear field, strictly taking a defensive posture. However, the enemy, because reinforcements have arrived and are crowded in a corner, as if there is no way out, is no different from trapping themselves in a dead end. They use aircraft and artillery to cover them, and repeatedly launch fierce counterattacks on our Baziqiao area front line, day and night. Last night, they attacked our Patriotic Girls' School three times, and the artillery fire was fierce as never before. The Patriotic Girls' School was also reduced to ashes. Our heroic soldiers, forced by the situation, used machine guns and hand grenades to fiercely repel the enemy and took the opportunity to advance, seizing more advantageous positions. This is indeed an unexpected gain.

### Enemy Aircraft Perpetrate Atrocities Again This Morning, Approximately 100 Civilians Killed or Injured

Flying to Southern Shanghai and Longhua to Drop Bombs, Destroying an Estimated 50 Civilian Houses

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) At around 9:00 AM today, enemy aircraft flew to southern Shanghai again to bomb it again. The Longzhang Paper Mill on Longhua Road was hit by four bombs, killing and injuring innocent citizens, reaching about 100 people. Tongren Fuyuantang urgently sent personnel to work, burying more than 30 corpses in total. More than a dozen corpses were collected by their families. The number of injured was large, and all were sent to hospitals by various charitable organizations. Also, at 2:10 PM, three enemy aircraft dropped four large bombs in the Gaochangmiao area, and the number of deaths and injuries is pending investigation. At around 7:20 AM this morning, enemy aircraft again carried out their inhuman, exterminationist, brutal and beastly acts, bombing innocent civilians of non-combatant personnel in the area outside Nanshi, Rihui Port, North Pier, and Longhua Road, dropping a total of more than a dozen bombs, destroying 50 civilian houses, and killing or injuring about 30 or 40 civilians. The details of the investigation are recorded below. At around 7:00 AM this morning, first, one enemy aircraft flew back and forth in the Nanshi urban area, then turned to Rihui Port and Longhua Road and flew low, immediately dropping a bomb. However, the residents there were all coolies and poor people. Seeing the enemy aircraft dropping bombs, they were terrified and fled in all directions. Then the enemy aircraft turned around and arrived again, and three enemy heavy bombers flew side by side, dropping eight bombs in succession. With a loud explosion, the houses there were bombed and collapsed, and the civilians were also killed and injured miserably. The Zhengnan South Goods Store at No. 935 and No. 937 Longhua Road immediately caught fire, and the fire was swirling and out of control. Later, it spread to Gengyuli, No. 933 Houtai.

### Enemy Aircraft Scatter Absurd Leaflets

Exhausted Tricks, Laboring in Vain

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) This morning, several enemy aircraft suddenly scattered a large number of leaflets over the Nanshi city walls and other places. There were about four kinds, and the content was absurd and ridiculous. Those who picked them up and read them all sneered. They thought they had exhausted their ability to provoke and threaten, and they felt proud of themselves, but we already knew that they were exhausted tricks, only showing that they were laboring in vain.

### Short Commentary

— Xiang

Adventure is something that people are unwilling to do and that everyone does not dare to do. Therefore, the saying goes, "Those who know fate do not stand under a dangerous wall." But when the surrounding environment is extremely bad and serious, you cannot help but take risks. If you reach a time when you should take risks, but you are unwilling to take risks, or dare not take risks, dangerous things will definitely become more and more pressing, and will eventually lead to the path of adventure. Otherwise, if you should take risks but are unwilling to take risks, or dare not take risks, you will eventually reach a point where you want to take risks but cannot. Therefore, those who can take risks for a time may be able to escape danger in the future. If you cannot or dare not take risks, you will inevitably be in danger and panic for the rest of your life, and there is no way to escape. The principle here is very easy to understand. If a country is under such severe environmental pressure, and still adopts prudence and conservatism, it should also think deeply about the reason.

### A Note to Friends Concerned About Relief Work (Part 1)

— Jiang Wuming

Originally, this piece shouldn’t have been written by me; it should have been written by the gentlemen in charge of relief work. However, in reality, they are presiding over an undertaking that inevitably involves some subjectivity, and they are constantly burdened with complex matters that require their diligent resolution and planning. Thus, it was deemed unnecessary to ask them to write this. Moreover, the war is not over, and the work is not finished, so the general report is not yet timely. However, given the current social mood, it's clear that people deeply care about today's relief efforts. Many are even picking up on minor incidents to criticize the relief authorities. These authorities, for the reasons mentioned above, cannot make a public statement at this time, creating a barrier of misunderstanding. If this continues, it will create considerable obstacles for the future of relief work. I work for an organization within the Shanghai Relief Center, and I am constantly hearing and seeing things. I believe I have a good understanding of the situation from all sides. I believe that with the long-term continuation of the war, even seemingly minor issues should not be kept silent any longer, leaving them to be pondered by friends concerned about relief work. Therefore, I dare to offer a more personal and, as I believe, accurate account.

Everyone remembers the vibrant atmosphere of public participation during the January 28th Shanghai Incident and believes that today's public work has undergone significant changes. Some even say that compared to the January 28th Incident, the current public work is not as good as before. Is this true? Some have pointed out the biggest difference between the January 28th Incident and now: during the former, it was merely a localized, spontaneous resistance by the Shanghai and Songhu troops, while today, it is a full-scale war of resistance launched under the planned command of the central government. Under different military and political conditions, the public's support and assistance in resisting the enemy naturally take different forms. During the January 28th Incident, spontaneous public support efforts were more prevalent, while controlled elements were fewer. Today, controlled elements significantly hinder the development of spontaneity. Thus, some, appreciating the progress in national military and political affairs, feel that today's public work seems disconnected and are greatly disappointed. I believe this conclusion is open to debate. I cannot speak for other areas of public work, but in terms of relief efforts, I can say without hesitation that although relief work today is moving towards control, even if this control has not reached a successful or perfect state, considerable gains have undoubtedly been made. Moreover, in terms of economic principles, statistics, and military-civilian exchanges, tangible results have been achieved.

Speaking only of the situation in Shanghai, the Shanghai Relief Committee and the Chinese Red Cross have a very close relationship, and their steps are all aimed at moving towards the centralized control of relief work. From this, they have developed a close relationship characterized by planning, budgeting, and step-by-step execution. During the 108 days of the Shanghai Incident, although the Red Cross and its affiliated organizations established over forty wounded soldier hospitals, the expenses exceeded one million yuan. Today, although the directly managed wounded soldier hospitals under the control of the Chinese Red Cross and the Shanghai Relief Committee are only a little less than twenty, and the number of contracted hospitals requiring subsidies from the organization is no less than twenty, the actual monthly expenditure, according to August statistics, does not exceed one hundred thousand yuan. Compared to the January 28th Incident, we cannot say that there was much waste during the latter, but I dare say that under the conditions of the central government's long-term resistance, this is the only comprehensive way to sustain it. At least, economic principles have been partially achieved. But regarding the current endeavors, anyone who participated in the relief work during the January 28th Incident cannot deny that today's medical equipment is superior to what it was before. If anyone thinks that today's comforts for wounded soldiers are not as good as before, or if they occasionally find something unsatisfactory and curse today's relief work, they have misunderstood the true premise of relief efforts and overlooked the future challenges of prolonged resistance.

Many patriotic individuals, driven by enthusiasm, cannot help but want to go to the front lines, and they are very eager to get work. They think that the only shortcut to the front lines is relief work, regardless of whether they have the skills or military knowledge. They say they are not afraid of hardship and want to serve the country. But when they encounter obstacles, they feel that those in charge of relief work are hateful because they do not grant them a chance to fulfill their wish. Some even say that the existing relief team members are not enough, that they lack courage, and that they let the wounded soldiers groan at the front without rescuing them. Why not let those of us who are not afraid to die go to rescue them? Because of the anxiety of these frustrated people, public opinion follows suit with criticism. Some even encourage a group of young people to take risks, believing that those in charge of relief work today only work at night and abandon the wounded soldiers who are suffering at the front during the day. They want a group of relief workers to risk their lives to rescue them. All of this stems from a misunderstanding of the actual situation of relief at the front. You need to know that the responsibility of a relief worker is not to go to the front line and work under intense fire. The responsibility of rescuing wounded soldiers at the front line rests with the medical teams. They are the ones who bandage or provide simple treatment to the wounded soldiers, and then the relief teams perform secondary inspections and treatments on them from the second line of defense, transporting the wounded soldiers to the rear. Because of this, our relief teams cannot work during the day, which does not mean that we are abandoning the wounded soldiers. The medical teams will take care of them. Assuming that the relief teams did work every day, and that there were qualified and courageous doctors who went to the front, they would not be able to perform major surgeries or provide meticulous treatment in peace, and they would not be able to transport the wounded soldiers to the rear. It would only make those brave doctors vulnerable. Not only would they not be able to save people, but they would also needlessly sacrifice technical talents who are prepared for long-term resistance. It would also make those medical teams seem redundant. Wouldn't that be empty talk? Moreover, those who abandon their normal occupations and insist on participating in patriotic actions without training or organization and join freely are like newly recruited soldiers, a disorganized mob. What achievements can be seen? At best, a few people will be sacrificed in vain, and a few lives will be lost for nothing.

Based on the above, some people may suspect that since we do not need passionate people to participate in relief work, then we will abandon it and let you people do it. This point of view is particularly dangerous. I said above that this Shanghai war of resistance is long-term, not temporary. What I said above is only to blame some enthusiastic friends for being too impatient. Recently, the Relief Committee passed a resolution: "The Relief Committee members, numbering over ×× people, have been working tirelessly outside for days and are likely to become ill. It is proposed to draw ×××× people from the registered trainees and assign them to work for adjustment." This clearly indicates that all registered personnel have the opportunity to serve, but only sooner or later. Seeing this fact, we know that impatience is useless. Relief work still depends on passionate young people to work, but we want to cultivate national strength and not sacrifice the lives of the nation too much. To adapt to the needs of long-term resistance, we will never tightly close the door of relief control and refuse and obstruct countless passionate young people!

### Yellow River Embankment Collapses at Zhengjia Temple, Putai, Shandong Province

Breach Reaches Over 1,500 Meters Wide, Guangrao, Shouguang, and Other Counties Become Disaster Areas

Jinan Correspondence: On August 28th, at 2:00 AM, the Yellow River's main current shifted south near Zheng Han Temple in Putai County, Shandong Province, eroding the embankment by over two meters wide, over twenty meters long, and over ten meters deep. The current was very rapid. By around 10:00 AM, the current became even more rapid, splitting the embankment in half for a length of over two hundred meters. Although a large number of burlap sacks were used for emergency repairs, and four new embankments were constructed, unexpectedly, at 1:00 AM on the 29th, the four embankments began to slide, and the embankment collapsed most severely, with a length of about twenty meters, the top of the embankment completely collapsed, and cracks were also seen on the river-facing slope. The total length of the collapsed embankment has reached over ninety meters, indicating a most urgent situation. Wang Kai Ru, the director of the Shandong River Defense Bureau, personally supervised the work and spared no effort to make emergency repairs in an attempt to salvage the situation and telegraphed the county heads of Zichuan, Qingcheng, Jiyang, Bin County, Guangrao, Lijin, and Huimin, requesting each to send 200,000 *jin* of civilian materials for emergency use day and night. Also, it is reported that since the evening of the 28th, new dangers have emerged on the south bank of the Zhengjia Temple embankment in Putai County. The water depth at the embankment's base is forty to fifty meters, and the main current is flowing sideways, causing the embankment to collapse fiercely and rapidly, unprecedented. Two or three days ago, it was heard that the top of the embankment had collapsed for over 2,000 meters. In recent days, Wang Kai Ru, director of the Shandong River Defense Bureau, Zhao Lu Ren, chief of the General Affairs Section, and Pan Yi Fen, chief of the Engineering Section, of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, have been supervising over ten thousand soldiers and civilians at the site, day and night, desperately defending the embankment (5,000 civilians from Putai, 2,000 civilians from Guangrao, and 1,000 civilians each from Boxing and Lijin). The Yellow River Conservancy Commission has also dispatched Director Liu Bing Zhong to personally supervise the emergency response. However, the emergency of the situation was unexpected. Emergency repairs were made with over ten sections of new embankments made from burlap sacks, but all efforts proved ineffective. Although materials were piled up like mountains and manpower was abundant, it was ultimately impossible for human effort to overcome nature. At 11:46 AM on the 31st, a breach finally occurred. The breach was approximately 1,500 meters wide, and the floodwaters rushed out, flowing eastward along the abandoned course of the Lingxun Wangjia Yuanquezi Liujuekou from the 17th year, heading towards the Yangjiao Gou Sea. Wherever it passed, fields and homes were submerged, and people drifted about. From the breach to the sea, it is over a hundred *hua li*, a vast expanse of water. The affected area includes the borders of Guangrao, Shouguang, Boxing, Putai, and Lijin counties. Fortunately, the area is mostly sandy terrain with fewer inhabitants, and the disaster may not be as severe as the previous ones. Wang Kai Ru, director of the Shandong River Defense Bureau, telegraphed the provincial government and the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to report the breach.

After receiving a summary report from the provincial government chairman Han Fu Ju, Civil Affairs Director Li Shu Chun and Zhang Shou Qian of the Provincial Assembly were dispatched to Zhoucun in a special train at 5:00 PM on the 21st and then transferred to a car to inspect the disaster situation at Zhengjia Temple and plan for the relief of disaster victims. The Provincial Relief Committee was also ordered to allocate 100,000 yuan to handle the urgent relief efforts. Furthermore, all civil servants in the province were ordered to deduct 20% of their salaries from next month for disaster relief. All relief measures will be based on the precedents set during the last breach, with disaster victims being transported to various counties for relief. On the same day, Han Fu telegraphed Chairman Chiang, Chairman Song of the National Economic Council, and Chairman Zhu of the Relief Committee, reporting the breach and the disaster situation and requesting an urgent allocation of 200,000 yuan to provide immediate relief to the refugees. Further reports on the direction of the floodwaters and follow-up arrangements will follow.

Regarding the flood situation on the first of this month, the head of the breach water flow reached Wenhua Tou, 45 *li* north of Boxing City, and Huangdian Township, 120 *li* from the city. It has reached Yantuan Town in the sixth district, 100 *li* north of Guangrao City, with a tendency to enter the sea through the lower reaches of the Xiaoqing River (2nd).

### Northern Hebei Faces Foreign Invasion While Southern Hebei Counties Suffer From Floods Again

Over Ten Counties Turn into Marshland, Affecting Over 100,000 People

Baoding Correspondence: Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the northern counties of Hebei Province have become military and bandit territories, and the people are living under constant artillery fire, suffering indescribable hardships. The central and southern counties are located in the rear, and although the pain and losses are relatively less, misfortune never comes singly. Since August, the rain has been continuous, often lasting for several days, causing mountain rivers to swell, and the rivers in the province have become torrential. The rivers overflow, causing flooding everywhere. Minor floods submerge fields, while major floods destroy homes and wash away everything. In particular, the southern counties of Hebei Province have suffered the most. Natural disasters and man-made disasters combine, leaving the people in despair. Those who do not die by fire perish in the water. It is truly tragic.

The Yellow River is the largest river in Hebei Province, located in the southernmost part of the province, flowing through Puyang, Dongming, and Changheng counties. Disasters frequently occur and are difficult to control. At the end of July, due to the impact of the earthquake, many leaks were discovered and were repaired by river workers. There were no major dangers. In early August, due to excessive rainfall, the upper reaches of Henan and Shaanxi flooded, and the river water poured in, making the northern bank extremely dangerous. The Lengzhai dams were flooded. The Yangqiu Dam in Puyang was flooded, and the northern section and the Shidong section of the embankment were under great pressure due to the impact of the Guanzhuang and Mengdi breaches. The various embankments in Hebei province are constantly sinking. The water level of the Nanyun River in the southeast of the province has risen to its highest level, and it is about to breach the embankment and flood the plains. The water depth in the center of the Qinghe River is 4.48 meters, and the height of the embankment above the water surface is only 0.66 meters. The situation is critical. In addition, the water levels of the Ziya, Beiyun, and Yongding rivers are also strained. The Hebei Provincial Government has established special river affairs bureaus to manage the repair and defense of these five major rivers. They are usually fully prepared for flood prevention and emergency response and cooperate with the county heads along the rivers to supervise the police officers, soldiers, and the river defense organizations formed by the public. They regularly patrol and guard the embankments and mobilize all forces to protect the dams. The defenses are very strong, so there have been no major disasters so far. The largest disasters in the past ten days have occurred in the Tuo, Yi, Zhang, Wei, and Li rivers. The basins of these rivers are all located in the southern counties of Hebei Province, where the water is usually calm, and there are few disasters. Therefore, there are no corresponding preparations for flood prevention and emergency response, and no special institutions are in charge. When the heavy rain poured in and caused mountain floods, the rivers breached and flooded everywhere. There was only panic and helplessness.

The Hutuo River flows through more than ten counties, including Anping, Raoyang, Lingxian, Jize, and Lixian in Hebei Province. The water is turbulent and constantly shifting. From August 3rd to 8th, there was continuous heavy rain, and mountain floods poured into the upper reaches. The downstream was silted up and could not bear the influx of water, causing the water level to rise sharply. The embankment northeast of Wu Maoying Village in Anping County was the first to breach in two places, each over ten meters long. The floodwater swept through the county, and four-fifths of the villages were surrounded by water. The ground water depth was four to five feet. Xin Ying and Mujiao were washed away. The roads in the county were completely destroyed. The four gates of the county town were also surrounded by water. The floodwaters flowed eastward, flooding the villages in the Dibei area of Yuyang County, and the fields were submerged. The fields in Diaojiao and other twenty villages in the west and east of the city were completely submerged. The dangerous works in Wanggang Village were breached by over ten feet. The southwest corner gate of the county town was sealed with sandbags to prevent minor problems. The traffic in the villages on the south bank was cut off. The floodwater bypassed the county town and flowed east into the territory of Cheng County. The county town was also surrounded by water. Most of the power poles were washed away. The floodwater flowed from the northwest bank of Shanxi Licun into Shanli Village in Jin County, reaching the county town, with a depth of four feet. Three breaches occurred on the south bank near Zhangjiazhuang, washing away countless people and livestock. Within the territory of Hejian County, the Hutuo River overflowed, washing away the foundation of the Ligang Town Road on the Hehan Su Road, with a water depth of three to four meters. In the territory of Shenze County, the water level of the Renshou irrigation channel, which is famous for its water conservancy, has increased to 1.2 *zhang*. The upstream of the South Gate has been washed away by four to five meters, the steel wire at the downstream has been broken, and the middle section of the dam has been destroyed by forty meters. The telephone lines of the north and south gates were cut off, and the situation was critical. In the county of Nanle, the water level of the Zhangnan River rose and reached the top of the embankment. Five breaches occurred at Zhangying, and seven or eight breaches occurred at Linzhang. The newly repaired embankments on both rivers were washed away due to the unsteady foundation. The water depth in the plains was three to five feet, and the new crops were submerged. The Dahanping Rain Highway was washed away for two to three *li*. In the counties of Renxian, Longping, and Nanhe, the Li River overflowed and washed away the dams. The sudden drop of mountain water in the upper reaches surrounded Nanli County. The Longyang River near Xingtai County overflowed, and over ninety villages and towns were affected. The water level was at its highest, reaching over ten feet deep. The Ximen Chenghu bridge has been washed away. In Jize County, the Zhuwei River rose by two to three feet, and a breach of thirty feet wide occurred in the old embankment to the east, flooding over twenty villages in the northeast. The remaining Shahe and Luohe Rivers are both dry rivers, but they also overflowed due to the water rise in the upper reaches, affecting eight villages in the west. In addition, the mountain water in Zanhuang County also poured down, and the Huai River, which has never been known to flood, has also overflowed, submerging fields and crops. There is no hope of harvesting.

In summary, the flood area in the provinces of Hebei has reached more than ten counties, the number of affected villages and towns is over 100,000, and the number of victims is no less than 100,000. The prefectural governments have telegraphed the special districts of the disaster areas to instruct them to devise measures to defend against the floods to prevent the disaster area from expanding, allocate provincial funds to relieve the disaster victims, and actively implement resettlement measures to prevent displacement. The special commissioners have received orders and are making efforts to carry out these tasks.

### During the War of Resistance, Relief and Production Should Be Considered Together

The Cixi Shanghai Association Telegraphed the Cixi County Government to Plan for the Establishment of Factories for the Poor

Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance in Shanghai, industry and commerce have been paralyzed. The number of displaced and unemployed merchants is more than a million. If charitable organizations only provide relief without finding ways to enable them to produce, then financial resources will decline day by day, manpower will be depleted, and the nation's vitality will be undermined, which is an obstacle to the War of Resistance. The government and gentry merchants in various places should establish factories for the poor in places with convenient transportation to settle unemployed refugees, so that they will not sit and wait for death and can increase productivity. The Cixi Shanghai Association telegraphed the county government yesterday (omitting the title): Since the August 13th Incident in Shanghai, the war zone compatriots have been displaced and have lost their homes. Witnessing the tragedy, our association, out of a sense of responsibility to protect our homeland, has planned to organize a relief committee, rented several trucks, and sent poor compatriots back to their hometowns from Shanghai free of charge. However, we believe that the compatriots who escaped from the war zone have lost their homes and properties, and their lives will be precarious after returning to their hometowns. If we do not find a way out for them, the strong will resort to taking risks, and the weak will become beggars, which will hinder the order of the rear. For this reason, we telegraphically request the chief magistrate to convene local wealthy gentry merchants to raise funds and establish factories for the poor in places with convenient water and land transportation to settle the unemployed compatriots in the war zone so that they will not sit and wait for death. The matter concerns the stability of the rear and the relief of compatriots. We urge you to do your best to plan. The telegraph cannot express our anxiety. (omitted below)
