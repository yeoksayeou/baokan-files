### Fierce Battle Between Yangxing and Liuhang: We Recover Our Original Positions

Our troops withdraw from Luodian and firmly defend the predetermined line. The enemy repeatedly attacks Xiangyin Road, suffers heavy losses, and retreats in defeat. The enemy attempts a surprise attack on Pudong from the lower reaches of the Huangpu River but fails again.

After our troops retreated to the first line of defense, the focus of the battle shifted to the line from Yong'an Bridge (between Yangxing and Liuhang) to Luodian. Our troops, according to the predetermined plan, stationed heavy troops and fortifications that were extremely strong. The battle situation on each road yesterday is described as follows: (1) Starting the day before yesterday, the enemy army used large numbers of aircraft to cover its fierce attack on our Yong'an Bridge. In the evening, the enemy army advanced to the area of Linjiazhai, Zhangzhai, and Xinzhai. After a fierce counterattack by our army, we recovered our original positions at dawn yesterday. (2) In Luodian, because our troops retreated to the first line of defense, the guard lines on both the left and right flanks were moved slightly backward. The enemy army then attacked in three routes with airplanes and artillery, setting fire to the town. Because our fortifications were destroyed, we were unable to defend it and instead firmly defended the predetermined line on the western outskirts of the town. (3) As for Xiangyin Road, the enemy army repeatedly attacked our positions at Qimei Road and Huangxing Road yesterday but was repelled by our army. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties. (4) In Pudong, the enemy's attempt to land had been planned for a long time, but after the entire army was wiped out in the Battle of Bailonggang, they were deeply wary and changed their strategy, planning to land from the lower reaches of the Huangpu River. Yesterday afternoon, several enemy ships sailed to places such as Maqiao, Duling, and Jingshenggang in the lower reaches of the Huangpu River, attempting to land, but all were repelled by our army.

### A Bloody Battle at Yong'an Bridge

Our troops roar with killing cries, and bayonets are stained red. The enemy soldiers retreat in panic, leaving corpses scattered everywhere.

On the north-south line parallel to the Panjingbang, east of Yangxing and north of Liuhang, with Yong'an Bridge as the center, enemy aircraft bombed the area the day before yesterday. At the same time, under the cover of the aircraft, the enemy army attacked our line, and the fierce battle reached its peak. In the evening, the enemy army advanced to the area of Linjiazhai, Zhangzhai, Xuzhai, and Xinzhai. At this time, reinforcements from the rear of our army arrived and launched a combined counterattack in the heavy rain. The enemy army was greatly alarmed, as the speed of our counterattack was beyond their expectations. Our army took advantage of the enemy's unstable footing to launch a fierce assault into the enemy's position, engaging in hand-to-hand combat in the muddy rain. The sound of killing shook the sky, and bayonets were stained red. The enemy army retreated in panic, leaving corpses scattered everywhere. Our army recovered its original position before dawn yesterday morning. As of last night, our army was still holding the line, and the enemy army did not dare to launch a full-scale attack.

### Our Troops Withdraw from Luodian Town

We firmly defend the predetermined line in the western suburbs.

According to the Central News Agency, for strategic reasons, our troops retreated to the first line of defense and moved the troops on both flanks of Luodian backward, but still firmly held the salient point of Luodian Town. After the enemy's siege was lifted, reinforcements were continuously added, concentrating elite troops of up to 6,000 men, and various heavy weapons were transported. After replenishment and deployment were completed, on the morning of the 13th, they first launched a concentrated bombardment with artillery and aircraft for a long time, and then used armored vehicles and other mechanized weapons to cover the infantry, attacking from Yuepu, occupying the area around the Binshan-Luodian highway as its center, and launching fierce attacks in three routes. Our army calmly responded to the battle, repelling them. In the evening, the enemy concentrated artillery fire and bombarded a point near Shulibridge. Our fortifications were destroyed, and the enemy took the opportunity to enter. Four tanks, followed by more than 800 soldiers, crossed the small river in Xiaojinzhai and attacked the east of Luodian. At the same time, another part of the enemy army fiercely attacked its north. Our army was determined to defend the land, relying on strong fortifications, bravely fought back, and jumped out of the trenches to engage in hand-to-hand combat many times, and finally severely defeated the enemy on the right flank. The day before yesterday, the enemy reorganized and came again, and a small unit finally broke through and entered, setting fire to the town. "The broken walls and ruins were again plundered. Because the fire spread very quickly, our army could no longer hold it and withdrew from the town to firmly defend the predetermined line in the western suburbs. In this battle, the enemy army suffered heavy losses, and our army also suffered considerable damage. At present, the battle in that area is still continuing.

### Yesterday, the Enemy on Xiangyin Road Repeatedly Attacked Our Positions but Failed

Until the evening, the enemy did not succeed.

### The Enemy in Hongkou Suddenly Tries to Make Trouble

The enemy in Hongkou, trapped for a month, now that our army has automatically withdrawn to the first line of defense and is moving in order, the enemy army thought there was an opportunity to take advantage of and suddenly tried to make trouble. The day before yesterday evening, several armored vehicles were used as a vanguard, followed by infantry, divided into two routes with the East Sports Association Road and Qimei Road as targets, and attacked northward, attempting to cut off the rear of our vanguard troops in the Yinxiang area. Our army had made preparations early and defended the original line of defense, unmoved. When they approached, we used machine guns and mortars to fiercely counterattack. After being attacked, the enemy lined up to confront us. Our army charged out of the trenches several times, one after another, and was unstoppable. After a fierce battle all night, the enemy made no progress and suffered heavy losses, so they retreated.

### The Enemy Launches a Surprise Attack on the Lower Reaches of Pudong

According to the Central News Agency, enemy ships anchored in the Huangpu River shelled Pudong from midnight to dawn yesterday, but because they were aimless, our army suffered no damage.

The enemy destroyer No. 21 sailed into the Huangpu River from Songkou yesterday morning and anchored at buoy No. 4. At 11:30 AM, more than 100 enemy soldiers suddenly disembarked from the destroyer No. 21 and took several motorboats, cruising on the river, seemingly attempting to land from Pudong again. However, our guard was tight, and if the enemy attacked, we would inflict heavy damage.

The enemy army repeatedly attempted to land from the Lujiazui area of Pudong but was repelled by our army and suffered heavy losses. The enemy then changed its strategy, attempting to land from the lower reaches of the Huangpu River. Yesterday afternoon, several enemy ships sailed to places such as Maqiao, Duling, and Jingshenggang in the lower reaches of the Huangpu River, attempting to land. When the enemy ships approached, our army immediately swept them with dense machine guns. The enemy army could not land and instead fired artillery at us to vent their anger. The landing attempt completely failed.

According to a Central News Agency report from Nanjing on the 15th, there is a place called Huangsha opposite Bailonggang in Chuansha, which is a sandy beach formed by waves, about seventy li long, with a population of about three or four hundred people. It is now occupied by the enemy army, who have closed it off as an airfield and completely massacred the residents of the beach, regardless of age, with no one spared. Also, the enemy in Shanghai-Songjiang, guided by traitors, searched for strong men, loaded them onto ships, and no one knows where they went. Also, when the enemy retreated from Beitang, they nailed more than a dozen of our wounded soldiers to the wall and shot them one by one. In Gujia Youche, a four-year-old girl was cut in half at the waist, and a fifty-year-old woman was raped and her lower body was cut. They are especially cruel to our refugees, searching and looting them before stabbing them to death with bayonets.

The Pudong District Red Cross Society has sent personnel to rescue and treat the injured.

At about 5:30 PM the night before last, enemy aircraft once again carried out large-scale, cruel, and tyrannical acts, randomly shooting and firing machine guns at our innocent civilians along the riverfront in Nanshi, the city, Pudong, and West Shanghai. For a time, bullets flew everywhere. A certain police officer, who happened to be on duty at his post opposite the Nanyang Inn on Minguo Road, Xiaodongmen, Nanshi, was tragically hit by a stray bullet, which entered through his eye socket and exited through the back of his head. The police officer was wounded and sought assistance, but died on the spot due to his serious injuries.

### The Municipal Party Department Decides on Commemorative Measures for September 18th

The whole city lowers the flag to half-mast and eats vegetarian food for one day, and conducts a spiritual national defense movement.

The sixth anniversary of "September 18th" is approaching in a blink of an eye. According to the commemorative principles set by the central government, the Shanghai Municipal Party Department has decided on the following commemorative measures for the city: (1) The whole city lowers the flag to half-mast. (2) All citizens of the city eat vegetarian food for one day, and the money saved is used to comfort the soldiers. (3) Advocate eating "Guangbing" (Note: "Guangbing" was the military food eaten by General Qi Jiguang's army during the Ming Dynasty's campaign against Japanese pirates. The military food of the soldiers fighting in Shanghai-Songjiang now is also an improved version of Guangbing, so eating Guangbing on the anniversary of "September 18th" can both commemorate Qi Jiguang and express the spirit of the people sharing the hardships of the soldiers. The Guangbing has now been notified by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to rush production for application by various food stores. It is hoped that in the future, a trend can be started and citizens will replace mooncakes with "Guangbing" during the Mid-Autumn Festival.) (4) All citizens of the city stand up in place and remain silent for three minutes at 12:00 noon on "September 18th." After the silence, they immediately raise their right hands and swear the following oath: "I swear to support the government with sincerity, obey the leader, sacrifice everything, and resist to the end." Before swearing, if there are multiple people gathered together, one person should be designated to lead the reading of the oath. For example, the head of the family in the family, the manager in the store, and the teacher in the school lead the reading. Also, pedestrians and vehicles on the road must stop at that time and immediately hold this ceremony. (5) Conduct a spiritual national defense movement: (A) During the period of resistance against the enemy, those who destroy the unified front of the entire nation's resistance will be regarded as traitors, and we swear not to coexist with them. (B) During the period of resistance against the enemy, those who have the strength but do not contribute it, and those who have money but do not contribute it, we will not recognize them as citizens of the Republic of China, and we swear to abandon them together with the people of the country. (C) During the period of resistance against the enemy, all troops of the Republic of China who do not participate in combat, or who participate but do not strive to fight, we will not recognize them as troops of the Republic of China, and we swear to abandon them together with the people of the country.

### Foreign Military Expert's Views on the Shanghai War

The Chinese army's terrain is unfavorable, but it fights bravely. The spirit of combat is far better than in the past.

Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency happened to meet a foreign military expert in a certain place. When talking about the Shanghai war, he greatly praised our army's orderly retreat to the predetermined first line of defense. He said that the Chinese army had already safely withdrawn in several places, and the Japanese side was still bombing with artillery. After discovering that the Chinese army had left its bombing destination, they slowly advanced cautiously to prevent landmine explosions. This alone shows that the Chinese army's advance and retreat are orderly, which is enough to impress people. He also believed that our army's retreat to a position with strong fortifications to defend was a favorable strategy. In the past month, the Chinese army fought on various lines, and it was extremely difficult to respond like interlocking gears. However, the Chinese army was still able to fight bravely against the massive Japanese naval artillery in this unfavorable terrain, inflicting extremely heavy damage on the Japanese army. This spirit is truly admirable. According to his observation, the first line of defense currently defended by the Chinese army is roughly similar to the position at the beginning of the January 28th Shanghai Incident, except that it is relatively longer. However, the quality, quantity, and fighting spirit of the Chinese army are far better than in the past, and the strength of the fortifications has also made significant progress. He does not believe that the Japanese army can achieve its goal of a quick victory.

### Our Representative Appeals to the League of Nations to Uphold Justice and Stop Aggression

Japanese actions endanger world peace, hoping to implement sanctions to punish them.

[Geneva] The chief representative of China, Gu Weijun, delivered a speech to the League of Nations today, requesting assistance to China in resisting Japanese aggression. Gu said that Japan is a threat to the treaty rights and commercial interests enjoyed by European and American countries in the East, saying that the Japanese government's purpose is not only political dominance and territorial conquest, but also to destroy the interests of various countries, and will eventually drive European and American countries out of the Far East. If a large part of China's land falls into the hands of the Japanese, then Japan will obtain a large amount of manpower and resources, and will further covet the rights and territories enjoyed by European and American countries in the South Pacific and the Pacific. In short, Japan will estimate to occupy 3 million square miles of China's land and drive 423 million people to form an invincible army to challenge the world. Gu then asked the League of Nations to invoke Articles 10, 11, and 17 of the Covenant to deal with it. Finally, or when invoking Article 16 of the Covenant to implement sanctions against Japan, and hoping to restore the 1932 Advisory Committee, and the United States participates. Gu finally said that even if the League of Nations cannot punish Japan, it is hoped that it can declare Japan an aggressor and not recognize Japan's illegal blockade of the Chinese coast, and condemn Japan's arbitrary killing of innocent civilians. (National Telegram on the 15th)

### The United States Calls on the World to Promote the Peace Movement

[Washington] The Washington Xiaoxing Daily today載稱 that the U.S. Secretary of State Hull submitted a peace movement document to the League of Nations, which proves that the United States intends to cooperate with the League of Nations to protect world peace. This move is clearly to once again call on world opinion to uphold the principles of maintaining international relations. As for the success or failure, it should be discussed separately. If the League of Nations takes organized action to restore peace, the United States is prepared to cooperate closely with it and give it sympathetic attention. This kind of hint from the United States welcomes the League of Nations to take stronger action, and the League of Nations should not misunderstand its true meaning. The newspaper then said that in 1932, the League of Nations was manipulated by the former British Foreign Secretary Simon, which led to the rejection of the proposal of the former US Secretary of State Stimson for British-American cooperation to制日, which is股鑒云.

### The Truth about the Japanese Coup, Which is Hidden in Every Possible Way, Has Gradually Been Revealed

A certain general was assassinated.

According to the Central News Agency, recently, various parties at home and abroad have spread that a coup d'état once occurred in Japan, but because the Japanese inspection of news is very strict, the truth has not been exposed. However, according to the Tokyo Chugai Business News on September 7, which recently arrived in Shanghai, the Q&A between the Seiyukai member Kawano Ichiro and the Minister of the Army Sugiyama at the general meeting of the House of Representatives budget on September 6 contains clues to the coup, and it can be seen that its nature is quite serious. The translation of the Q&A is as follows:

(Question) It is rumored that a certain general was assassinated, but the army authorities have not yet announced it. What is the truth and what is the army's attitude towards this matter? (Answer) This question will definitely be announced in the future, but it has not yet reached the time to announce it. What can be said is that the general has not yet been assassinated to death. As for the current situation, it is confidential and cannot be announced temporarily.

### The British Ship Refuses to Transport Coal to Japan: The Seamen's Union Thanks You

For the sake of world peace and happiness, we are willing to work together to eliminate this scum.

The crew of the British ship Sifan Lehu refused to transport coal to Japan to express their opposition to Japan's invasion of China, and all the information has been reported in the newspapers. Our China Seamen's Union expressed yesterday that the seamen of that country have this performance, which is very admirable, and specially telegraphed the entire crew of the ship to express their thanks. The original telegram is recorded as follows: To all the crew of the British ship Sifan Lehu in Hong Kong: Reading the Hong Kong telegram of the Central News Agency on the 11th, I learned that you have rejected代日人運煤返國 to oppose the violent Japanese invasion of our country, to彰公道 and 明是非. I am very威佩 from afar. The violent Japanese are横蛮, just like野獸. Since being惨遭敗北 in the all-out war against us, they have been恼羞成怒 and willfully横行. Not only do they bombard our bare-handed refugees and burn our cultural institutions, but they also deliberately摧殘 the lives and property of people from friendly countries. The横被轟炸 of the American Church Hospital in Nantong and the惨遭襲擊 of Your Ambassador Xu Gesen are obvious examples. If such an international公敵 and人類蟊賊 are not removed, it will be difficult to ensure world peace and happiness. It is尚望 to work together to eliminate this scum. I express my thanks with this telegram. I hope you understand, China Seamen's Union, with the cold seal of the dispatched office.

### Gu Weijun Painfully Recounts Japanese Atrocities

A Good Impression at the Assembly Earns Enthusiastic Applause

[Geneva] Today, the chief representative of China, Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to France, addressed the League of Nations General Assembly on the Sino-Japanese conflict. Consequently, the Chinese issue has become the focus of attention for all nations. Ambassador Gu stated that the Far Eastern question, due to its extremely serious situation, requires urgent action by the League of Nations. China has formally appealed to the League of Nations, citing Articles 10, 11, and 17 of the Covenant. It is now up to the Executive Yuan to decide whether to consider and take action itself, or to submit the issue to the General Assembly, or to the Sino-Japanese conflict advisory committee organized by the League of Nations after the Manchurian Incident. Gu continued, "For the past month or two, our country has endured Japan's military aggression. In order to achieve its political control and territorial conquest, Japan has dispatched over 300,000 troops, dozens of warships, and countless military aircraft to China. Japan's troops, armed with the sharpest weapons, have attacked and occupied Tianjin, Beiping, Nankou, Zhangjiakou, and other places in North China, and are now continuing to invade the interior of China. In the south of China, with the assistance of its powerful navy, the Japanese army is attempting to seize Shanghai. The Japanese navy has also illegally declared a complete blockade of the Chinese coast, and Japanese military aircraft are systematically bombing large and small cities and towns in thirteen provinces of China, some of which are located hundreds of miles inland. Although China feels all kinds of disadvantages, it has been forced to resist this renewed military aggression. Therefore, a fierce conflict has erupted between the aggressor who, without any scruples, wants to forcibly enforce his wishes with military force, and the self-defender who is determined to save the country and protect its people, and the fighting is still ongoing. Furthermore, because Japan is using the Shanghai International Settlement as a base for its military operations to attack the Chinese army, the lives and property of foreigners have suffered serious losses. Now, under the control of a cruel and ruthless military, Japan has openly used force as a tool of its policy and has unleashed its powerful war machine to seek control and conquest of China and the Asian continent. Japan's true purpose has become obvious after its reinforcements arrived and attacked not only Tianjin but also Beiping. Therefore, what must be known today is whether international law and treaty obligations can be perpetually violated with impunity, whether we recognize illegality as inevitable, and whether we will sit idly by and watch its claws spread, allowing it to destroy world peace and security without restraint. I feel that if we still value the treaties we have signed and the League of Nations Covenant that we solemnly declared to uphold, it may not be impossible to salvage the situation. The illegal blockade of the Chinese coast endangers the recognized rights of shipping and commerce and must be rejected, as it is the sharp edge of a wedge that encroaches on maritime freedom. The European situation is in fact not unrelated to the Far Eastern situation. This is the natural result of the failure to fulfill covenant obligations when the Manchurian crisis was brought before the League of Nations. Is the principle of collective security contained in the Covenant accepted by all of us without question? It is the only logical and solid foundation for any organized system of world peace. The hope of eliminating the Far Eastern disaster and consolidating peace in the Pacific and Europe rests on our solemn collective fulfillment of our obligations under the Covenant and other treaties to which we are parties." After Dr. Gu Weijun's speech, no one else took the floor, so the assembly was adjourned. Chairman Aga Khan declared that if no speaker requests a meeting tomorrow, a plenary session will not be held. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 15th)

[Geneva] After the chief representative of China, Gu Weijun, delivered a speech at the League of Nations General Assembly this morning, an unusually enthusiastic impression was created within the assembly hall. Not only was there thunderous applause when Gu stepped down from the podium after finishing his speech, but the listeners also applauded greatly after the interpreters translated it into French. This was unprecedented in the League of Nations conference hall. The three key points that the delegations of various countries paid the most attention to in Mr. Gu's speech were: ① China asks all countries to take action, not only to save China but also to protect the interests of all countries in the Far East. ② What China asks of the League of Nations is only the condemnation of Japan's blockade of the Chinese coast by the League of Nations, in addition to moral support. ③ The Chinese side believes that Western countries must act in concert with the United States. The reason why Mr. Gu suggested submitting this issue to the Advisory Committee (of which the United States is also a member) established by the League of Nations General Assembly on February 24, 1933, is precisely for this reason.

### Japan, Italy, and Germany Conclude Tripartite Agreement

Implications of a Military Alliance - Russian Newspapers Reveal Information

[Moscow] The meaning of the rumored imminent conclusion of the Italo-Japanese agreement is being widely discussed in local newspapers. The Pravda stated that a military alliance between the two countries is a foregone conclusion, adding that the alliance is directed against Britain. "What Tokyo hopes for is that Britain will be deeply drawn into the vortex of the Mediterranean, while Rome wants to transplant its attention from the Far East." The newspaper anticipates that a tripartite agreement will be concluded between Germany, Italy, and Japan, and states that the alliance between Italy and Japan proves the joint response of peaceful nations to attempt collective defense of peace and security, and the Nyon Agreement has indicated the possibility of such a collective defense organization.

### US Prohibits Government Ships from Transporting Munitions to China and Japan

This Action Should Not Be Regarded as Invoking the Neutrality Act - Most Japanese Munitions Purchased from Canada

[Washington] President Roosevelt today ordered the prohibition of government ships from transporting munitions to China and Japan. As for other American merchant ships that attempt to transport munitions to China and Japan, the risks should be borne by the merchants themselves. According to the announcement of this order by the President, it was made after careful consultation with Secretary of State Hull and the Chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission, but this order should not be regarded as an invocation of the Neutrality Act. The policy of the United States is still subject to temporary dramatic changes. (National News Agency, 14th)

[Washington] President Roosevelt's announcement of this order is purely to satisfy the wishes of a faction within the country that strongly advocates the implementation of the Neutrality Act. However, the President is trying to delay the invocation of this law, so this announcement is not out of Roosevelt's original intention. The Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Wang Zhengting, refused to comment on this before receiving instructions from Nanjing. (National News Agency, 14th)

⊙Ottawa The National Executive Committee of the Canadian Cooperative Society Federation issued a statement today stating that Canada's economy is now rapidly becoming part of the Japanese war machine. Canada should urgently implement the Neutrality Act regarding the Sino-Japanese war, and stated that Canada's trade with Japan has greatly increased compared to a year ago. The Japanese militarists are now increasingly dependent on Canada for military supplies. The Canadian government should prohibit the transportation of war materials to Japan.

### Japan Attempts to Shirk Responsibility for the British Ambassador's Bombing

[London] British well-informed sources recently announced that the formal reply that the Japanese government will submit regarding the attack on British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, will be roughly the same as the country's interim reply earlier this month (i.e., expressing regret and stating that the results of the investigation did not prove that the perpetrators were Japanese Air Force personnel). The British government will refuse to accept the three demands previously made by Britain. What attitude the British government will take after receiving the reply has not yet been decided. According to reports, the government is still considering withdrawing the ambassador to Japan, but certain cabinet members believe that this move is sufficient to cause difficulties and express opposition. Therefore, the method of dealing with it will be decided after Foreign Secretary Eden and Prime Minister Chamberlain consult. (Havas, Central News Agency, 14th)

### American Exporters Temporarily Withdraw from the Chinese Market

Trade with Japan Also Sharply Reduced

[New York] After insurance companies announced the cancellation of cargo insurance to China and Hong Kong, it was recently learned that 90% of the trading companies exporting to China have now temporarily withdrawn from the Chinese market and are seeking other areas of business. Since the start of the Sino-Japanese conflict, trade with Japan has been greatly reduced, but this is mostly due to Japan's own restrictions. Many representatives of American exporting companies have now left Japan and gone to Southeast Asia, hoping to seize the business that originally belonged to Japan. At the same time, they will investigate the markets in India, South Africa, the Straits Settlements, and Java. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 15th)

### Ma Yinchu Talks About Food Control

[Nanjing] A reporter visited Hangzhou and returned to Beijing to talk about meeting Ma Yinchu in Hangzhou. According to Ma, free competition and free prices are not applicable in extraordinary times, and government control should arise accordingly. For example, the new Dahua Theater, which was opened in Chengdu after the National Theater, would normally be fine. However, in times of war, if someone has funds and wants to invest in businesses that are not very necessary for the war, the government can order them to stop. Indirectly, social idle funds can be used to purchase National Salvation Bonds to fill military needs. In extraordinary times, raising military expenses is the most important thing, and the government can control them. The government has the priority to use idle funds. Regarding the way to control food and food prices, Ma said that for arable land in the country that is not cultivated, the government should force the owners to cultivate it. Otherwise, it will be handed over to the government to cultivate, which can not only increase food but also relieve unemployment. On the one hand, land rent should be reduced so that farmers can increase. (Special Dispatch, 15th)

### North China Daily News Comments on the Likely Protraction of the Shanghai Battle

The Perseverance of the Chinese Troops is Admirable; Resistance in Shanghai is Relevant to the Overall War Situation

The North China Daily News published an editorial yesterday titled 'The First Act,' stating roughly that the fighting around Shanghai, with the Chinese troops retreating to the Luodian, Liuhang, Dachang, and Zhabei lines, seems to have concluded its first act. This is different from the January 28th Incident, as there has not been a full retreat to locations quite far from Shanghai. The Chinese troops' battles to halt the Japanese advance have clearly come at a heavy price. Although the Chinese troops lacked artillery support in the battle, and the aerial reconnaissance was also insufficient to resist the Japanese naval guns and seaplanes, their infantry and machine gunners fought for a month, and their perseverance is truly admirable. Generally speaking, if the Chinese troops in the Shanghai area can minimize casualties to the greatest extent possible, it will be extremely beneficial to the war effort. This seems to be a very reasonable argument. Once the Chinese troops can avoid the Japanese naval guns, their defense will surely become even stronger. Therefore, it is not surprising that the current lines are not intended for all-out defense if the Chinese troops want to resist for a long time. However, it is useless to speculate about the war situation until there is clearer evidence of the will of both sides. It is regrettable that the short four weeks of fighting have caused tremendous losses of life and property, and even more sadly, the war zone itself has become a wasteland. Shanghai has once again experienced the enormity of the cost of two modern armies engaging in hostile activities, and the end is still far off. The Japanese invading army is now steadily increasing its forces, and the fighting on the edge of the International Settlement may therefore become more intense. In the coming period, new changes in the overall situation may gradually stabilize the situation along the Huangpu River, but the great battle of Shanghai is unlikely to lose its urgency in the short term. Furthermore, the people of Shanghai, while fulfilling their responsibilities, should not ignore the vast scope of this war, which is far greater than the January 28th Incident. The great battle in North China was expected, and Guangzhou was also subjected to naval bombardment after air raids. Although Japan has not declared war on China, it is wreaking havoc along the coast and inland. This seems to be merely a continuation of expressing the value of Japanese friendship. All ports except Qingdao have also been blockaded by the Japanese navy. Therefore, from the Humen Forts in the south to Zhangjiakou in the north, a prairie fire has broken out. Shanghai is only part of this great catastrophe. The Chinese high command regards the resistance around Shanghai as an important factor in the overall war situation. This decision is due to the trend of various activities by the Japanese in Shanghai after the January 28th Incident. This fact cannot be ignored when estimating the possibilities of the future. At present, neither side has won a victory that can determine the success or failure of the entire war in the north, south, and central China, so it is generally believed that the war is likely to be prolonged. Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's statement that the war will extend to 1938 can be considered far-reaching. Therefore, both China and Japan, and anyone related to the Far East, are concerned about the future. Even peace-loving observers find it difficult to confidently conclude how unconscious this obedience to the command of warmongering is. Konoe also said that he would whip China until it knelt down and asked the world to stand by and watch Japan's educational actions. The result of this brutality seems to only increase the resentment of the other party and inflict a tragic reward on the leaders of evil, yet no one seems to dare to offer Konoe a piece of loyal advice. It is frightening to think about. Konoe accused the Chinese government of encouraging anti-Japanese sentiments and wanting to foster friendship with China. Does he sincerely believe that the bombs dropped by Japan in various major cities in China are true envoys of friendship, or are they spreaders of anti-Japanese sentiments? Although the Chinese troops' equipment is inferior to that of the Japanese troops, their courage is not diminished in the slightest. The Japanese troops' advance through the enemy's brave lines, no matter what victory they may gain, gives the world today an impression that Japan is a violent, muddled, and cramped aggressor.

### All Sectors Enthusiastically Subscribe to National Salvation Bonds, Labor and Management Cooperate

Commercial Press Adds 100,000 Yuan Subscription; Lawyers Association Subscribes 130,000 Yuan; Accountants Team Has Already Exceeded Quota

Commercial Press

The Commercial Press has suffered two national disasters in the past five years. The losses in the January 28th Incident were extremely heavy. Thanks to the planning of the authorities and the efforts of its colleagues, it has fortunately recovered its original state in the past five years. However, before long, it suffered again in the August 13th Incident. The direct and indirect losses suffered were also very large. The authorities of the press are working hard, as in the situation after the January 28th Incident, on the one hand preserving the cultural undertaking, and on the other hand maintaining the livelihood of its colleagues. In the midst of hardship and difficulty, they still do not forget the national salvation undertaking. They spare no effort in promoting national salvation bonds. The company and its colleagues have already jointly purchased 150,000 yuan. Their announcement and measures are attached below.

To the public: The government has issued 500 million yuan in national salvation bonds for long-term resistance. All of our citizens have the obligation to do their best to subscribe. Now, all public and private organizations, both groups and individuals, are enthusiastically contributing, either purchasing as much as they can or subscribing according to a percentage of their salaries. Our company and its colleagues are enthusiastic about saving the country and do not want to lag behind. Although they have suffered significant losses due to the war and are struggling to maintain themselves, they still勉力contributed 50,000 yuan to national salvation donations a few days ago, to express their intention to serve the country. Now that national salvation bonds have been issued, it is proposed to go a step further and do our best to subscribe. In addition to converting the 50,000 yuan in national salvation donations that have already been raised into national salvation bonds, the company and all its colleagues will add another 100,000 yuan in national salvation bonds, for a total of 150,000 yuan. The measures are outlined below.

Commercial Press Company and Colleagues Jointly Purchasing 150,000 Yuan in National Salvation Bonds Method: ㊀ The company and all its colleagues will jointly purchase 150,000 yuan in national salvation bonds. In addition to converting the previous 50,000 yuan in national salvation donations, the company will add 50,000 yuan, and all colleagues will add 50,000 yuan. ㊁ The 50,000 yuan added by the company, plus the previous 25,000 yuan in national salvation donations, for a total of 75,000 yuan, will be allocated continuously at 5% of the cash revenue from the Shanghai issuing office's business and the cash remitted by the branches, starting from August 1st of this year, until this amount is satisfied. ㊂ The 50,000 yuan added by the colleagues, plus the previous 25,000 yuan in national salvation donations, for a total of 75,000 yuan, will be deducted from half of the regular holiday allowance of colleagues in the general and branch offices at the end of this year, except for 25,000 yuan that has already been deducted from the long-term savings interest of colleagues. Another 15,000 yuan will be specially added by the company's general manager, assistant manager, and above the deputy section chief of the general office, and above the deputy manager of the branch office. The aforementioned added amount can be withdrawn from long-term savings. Those without long-term savings can pay in equal installments over seven months. ㊃ National salvation bond certificates will be issued in denominations of 5 yuan as the lowest unit. If the total of long-term savings interest and holiday allowance deducted from colleagues is less than 5 yuan, the principal and interest stored in the colleague's long-term savings should be deducted to make up the full 5 yuan. Those without long-term savings will have their holiday allowance deducted to make up the full 5 yuan. If it is already full 5 yuan and there is still an odd number, the personnel department will notify each person after calculation. If they wish to make it up to 10 yuan, the amount made up will be deducted from each person's long-term savings. If there are no long-term savings or they do not wish to make it up, the odd number will be donated for the use of rescuing wounded soldiers and refugees. The rest is similar. ㊄ After the national salvation bond certificates are received, the company will distribute them to the colleagues who subscribed. ㊅ The total amount of 150,000 yuan jointly subscribed by the company and its colleagues, except for the 10,000 yuan that has already been remitted in August, will be remitted by the company to the receiving bank in seven months, 20,000 yuan per month, from the end of September in the 16th year to the end of March in the 27th year. If there is a surplus, it will be remitted in the last month.

### Ministry of Finance to Correct Cash-Only Tax Collection

Ministry of Finance Restricts Cash Withdrawals Very Strictly; Hubei Province Requested Flexibility in Check Payments Early On

Xin Sheng She says that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce recently believed that the Ministry of Finance's Tax Affairs Department's requirement that Da Zhonghua Match Company pay taxes in cash was difficult to justify. Regardless of the measures to stabilize finance in this extraordinary period, it fundamentally undermines the law. A special telegram was sent to the Ministry of Finance to strictly order correction. The details can be found in the newspapers of September 11. The reporter believes that this matter is of great importance, so he specially consulted a financier to ask for his opinion. According to him, although this matter on the surface seems to be only a question of whether the tax collection agency is enforcing the law, in this extraordinary period, all parties should act according to the plans set by the government, fulfill their responsibilities, and strive to comply. Although the motive of the Tax Affairs Department's restriction of cash payments for tax collection is unknown, as mentioned in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's telegram, the restriction of cash withdrawals is a plan of the Ministry of Finance to stabilize finances, and merchants and the public should pay taxes with checks according to the Ministry's order. In addition, at the beginning of the Shanghai battle, the Ministry of Finance stipulated strict restrictions on cash withdrawals for general depositors in order to stabilize the overall financial situation. Even if companies and firms issued salaries to employees, or needed to withdraw cash due to special circumstances, they had to first state the actual needs, clarify the purpose, and submit a written application. After the bank verified it, it was forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for approval. The application form must also state "If it is found that there is any falsehood, I am willing to be punished by the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Interference with National Currency," etc. It can be seen that after the implementation of measures to stabilize finances, the people's withdrawal of cash has been subject to absolutely strict restrictions, so how can they obtain cash to pay taxes? Furthermore, after the announcement of measures to stabilize finances, the Hubei Provincial Government did not reject merchants and the public paying taxes with checks and requested flexibility. For checks received by the collection agency, regardless of the amount, it was requested to be allowed to go to the bank for exchange to take care of both sides. The Ministry of Finance believed that tax collection and expenditure should be flexible and issued a circular to comply with it in August of this year. Now, the Tax Affairs Department's need to collect cash does not seem very reasonable. In this long-term war of resistance, the nation's economic organization should strive for stability. Factories in dangerous areas should make every effort to move goods and machinery to safe areas, leaving more vitality for the country is to increase the strength of resistance. Tax collection agencies should also consider the situation and make changes accordingly. If it is not intentional tax evasion, but capital-rich and担保工 has a guarantee of industrial and commercial factories, they should be particularly considerate, allowing a longer period. Since the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for correction, it is expected that this matter can be handled flexibly.

### Comfort Association Seeks Cotton Vests

The Goal is to Hope for 40,000 People to Participate in General Mobilization

Hand-sewn clothes are a beautiful story in ancient times. The heart of sharing the same hatred and enemy is the great frustration of the Chinese nation. At this time, the north wind is gradually getting cold, and the soldiers are suffering from the cold. All my sisters in the boudoir are thinking of the soldiers. The Shanghai Comfort Association has learned from this, so it has launched the initiative to seek cotton vests for soldiers. Assuming that each person can make one cotton vest in two days, then with 40,000 people participating in consistent work within ten days, it will not be difficult to collect 200,000 in time. The collection methods are specified as follows: ㊀ The soldiers who are fighting against the war in bathing, both in North China and Songhu, should be mindful, so the vests are pre-set to one million pieces. The first time, 200,000 pieces will be collected first, which will be appropriately distributed to the front. The deadline is from September 18 to September 28, for a total of ten days. ㊁ Invite women's groups to take the lead and encourage each group to make or solicit a number of pieces, which can be sent by the group in the name of the association. ㊂ The wartime service group of the city's Boy Scouts promotes all or part of the task of soliciting donations from all sectors and distinguishes its achievements for reward. ㊃ If there are those who wish to donate cloth cotton but have no manpower, they can ask the relief association to send refugee work to the Shanghai Comfort Association. The wages are paid by the donors. ㊄ Newspapers and radio stations should widely persuade and report the number of pieces received daily. ㊅ From now on, those who wish to donate vests within the time limit can contact the Shanghai Comfort Association Solicitation Group on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Fellow Association on Yu Qiaqing Road. Also, the Cotton Fabric Industry Association has donated 30,000 pieces of cloth for cotton vests alone. Cotton has been solicited from the Cotton Association, and the wages are donated by Mr. 杜月笙.

### Director Pan Talks About Wartime Education Issues

Should Emulate the Spirit of the French People; Stringed Instruments Did Not Cease During the Franco-Prussian War

Central News Agency says that it has been more than a month since the outbreak of the War of Resistance in this city. Now the schools have reached the opening period, but many schools have either fallen into the war zone or are hindered by the environment, and many have been suspended invisibly. The reporter specially visited Director Pan of the Social Bureau yesterday to inquire about everything. Director Pan received him and issued a statement saying, Regarding the education issue in this city, the bureau is currently planning in a unified manner. In the past, because many schools were attached to refugee shelters or wounded soldier hospitals, it was difficult to end them temporarily, so the notice was issued to extend the opening date. Now it can be gradually vacated, so within the possible range, it is hoped that primary and secondary schools will find ways to open first. As for universities or specialized schools, it is best if they can still open in Shanghai. Otherwise, we plan to ask the Ministry of Education to provide subsidies to designate the relocation to the inland. In short, although this city is located on the front line of the War of Resistance, education is the foundation of the country, and we must ensure that it does not stop due to the War of Resistance. We should emulate the spirit of the French people during the Franco-Prussian War. Even though the army was under the city of Paris, the schools were still in class, which is in line with the purpose of the long-term War of Resistance.

### Our Troops Retake Luodian Town at Midnight

Last night, taking advantage of the rain, we counter-attacked, and the enemy retreated in disarray. At dawn, the enemy massed reinforcements for another assault. We met them head-on with a fierce counterattack, and the bloody battle continued until noon.

The focus of the battle remains in the Luodian area. After our troops withdrew from Luodian Town on the 13th, they firmly defended the designated defensive line on the western outskirts. At 8 PM last night, our fresh troops arrived and launched a fierce counterattack on the enemy in Luodian Town from three directions. The enemy responded in haste. Because of the rain and muddy roads, our troops, wearing straw sandals, moved lightly and nimbly, while the enemy's leather shoes were heavy and cumbersome, making their movements faltering. In the ensuing melee, countless enemies were killed. By midnight, our troops had retaken Luodian Town, and the enemy retreated in disarray with heavy losses. At dawn this morning, the enemy gathered a large number of reinforcements and launched another assault on our Luodian Town defensive line. We immediately relied on the enemy's existing defensive works to calmly and firmly defend our position. Under the cover of aircraft and artillery, the enemy repeatedly charged close to our defensive line, but were met with a head-on counterattack, leaving corpses strewn across the field. However, the enemy reinforcements continued to arrive, making an all-out effort to seize the position. For a time, the artillery fire was intense. Our various units also concentrated their forces to respond and launched the fiercest of bloody battles, which had not stopped by noon today. East of Luodian, our troops originally firmly defended the area of Wudoujing, Xiaoqianzhai, and Shulibridge. Because it was an exposed position, it has now been withdrawn to areas such as Nanbeitangkou, where they are firmly defending along the river. At the same time, our troops in Gujiage are also defending the Henan position, confronting the enemy across the river. From north of Yong'an Bridge to the line of Cunqiansi and Gujiage, we are holding the original defensive line. The enemy has launched several assaults, all of which have been repelled. In addition, the artillery battle was fierce on the Jiangwan Zhabei defensive line. The enemy's infantry and cavalry units have launched several assaults, but our defenses are solid and immovable. Many enemy ships have gathered in the Liuhaxiaochuanshakou area, seemingly preparing to land.

According to a report from the front this morning by the Central News Agency, many enemy ships are anchored on the river near Liuhaxiaochuanshakou, seemingly preparing to land.

### Killing Enemies like Hemp in the Rain

Our Troops Achieve a Great Victory in Recapturing Luodian - Seizing Countless Enemy Supplies

Due to strategic considerations, our troops retreated to the first line of defense. In the Luodian area, our troops on both flanks also moved back slightly. The new defensive line has been completely deployed. Yesterday evening, taking advantage of the enemy's respite, our left-wing troops, unexpectedly, advanced suddenly in the rain and launched a fierce counterattack on the enemy in Luodian. The enemy, who had just entered Luodian and had not yet gained a foothold, were caught off guard by this heavy blow and fled in panic. Killing enemies like hemp in the rain, our troops, using machine guns and grenades, charged forward fiercely. Both sides engaged in a melee, fighting hard for every inch of ground. The enemy's losses were particularly heavy. Until midnight last night, the Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attack and withdrew from Luodian. We seized countless enemy supplies. After recapturing the town, our troops relied on the enemy's fortifications to defend it tightly. At dawn this morning, enemy reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce counterattack. In addition to melee combat, artillery fire filled the sky. As of noon today, the battle was still raging.

On the morning of the 14th, our troops began a counterattack on the enemy's defensive positions north of Luodian with two columns of troops, using intense artillery fire to cover our troops' advance. At midnight that day, they advanced to the west of Zhangjiayan, Hongjiazhai, Lijiazhai, and Dingjialou, successively recapturing the key locations. The enemy stubbornly resisted, deploying a dense network of fire to prevent our troops from advancing. Our troops made every effort to use the enemy's defensive works, advancing step by step. Yesterday morning, the enemy launched a counterattack with 2,000 troops, attempting to retake the position, but were met with a head-on attack by our troops. The enemy collapsed in disarray. Our troops seized an enemy 22nd Regiment flag and countless military supplies. Last night, the enemy attacked again, and the fierce battle continued until this morning.

### Confrontation Across the River at Shulibridge

Once Forced the Enemy to Retreat on the Morning of the 14th - Changed the Defensive Line and Held Firm Due to Exposed Position

The enemy troops launched a fierce attack on Luodian, attempting to complete the connection between Yuepu and Luodian. For the past three days, they have been attacking our Chen position at Shulibridge, east of Luodian. On the 13th and 14th, both sides charged and engaged in melee combat, advancing and retreating repeatedly in a bloody and unrelenting battle. On the morning of the 14th, our troops suddenly launched a fierce counterattack, once forcing the enemy to retreat. However, in the afternoon of that day, the enemy advanced with more than ten tanks covering their infantry. At the same time, they bombarded Shulibridge with intense artillery fire. Our troops fought bravely and resisted for three hours. Our troops considered that the Shulibridge position was too exposed and difficult to defend, so they changed the defensive line to the riverbank between Gujiage and Xiaoxianzhai, confronting the enemy across the river.

### Fierce Battle at Zhudian Still Deadlocked

The Enemy Attacks Again and Again, Suffering Heavy Casualties - We Hold Firm and the Two Armies Face Each Other

While the enemy's central force launched a fierce attack on Shulibridge, their left flank, with a force of about one column, launched a flank attack on our right-wing position along the Changdi west of Xinzhen, crossing Xiaojinzhai and attacking our Zhudian position via Dongzhaixiang and Xizhaixiang. Our troops rose up to meet them, displaying unparalleled bravery, fighting one against a hundred. They used machine guns and mortars to fiercely attack the invading enemy. The enemy troops suffered heavy casualties and retreated after being unable to withstand the attack.

At dawn yesterday morning, enemy reinforcements arrived again and attacked Zhudian. Fierce fighting broke out in Nanbeitangkou and the surrounding area, continuing throughout the day. The fighting was even fiercer last night. Our troops held firm and refused to retreat. As of this morning, the two armies were still locked in a stalemate at Zhudian.

### Intense Artillery Fire at Yong'an Bridge

The Enemy Hopes to Destroy Our Defensive Position - Tanks Are Ineffective Due to the Rain

In the Yong'an Bridge area, the enemy attempted to attack with tanks. Although there was continuous fighting for days, our troops fought bravely, and the enemy was never able to approach our defensive position. Yesterday, the enemy concentrated its artillery fire, launching a dense and fierce barrage, hoping to destroy our defensive position. The artillery fire was intense, and did not stop until late at night. Our rear artillery units also returned fire. The damage to our defensive position was minimal. Yesterday morning, the enemy also bombarded Gujiage Nanbeitangkou with heavy artillery, attempting to cover their infantry's advance, but due to the rain and muddy roads, the tanks were unable to move and were completely ineffective. The enemy troops stopped in front of our defensive position, not daring to advance further.

### Artillery Battle Raged All Day at Baziqiao

The Enemy's Attack on Chizhi University Was Repelled - The Enemy's Bridges at Baziqiao Were Destroyed by Us

For the past two days, the enemy in the Jiangwan Road area has been harassing our defensive position from time to time. After the enemy at the Patriotic Girls' School was repelled on the 14th, there was also fierce fighting in the Shuidian Road area at dawn yesterday morning. The enemy at Baziqiao frequently bombarded our defensive position with heavy artillery, totaling more than a thousand rounds. A small detachment of enemy troops, estimated to be four or five hundred men, launched a fierce attack on our Chizhi University. Our defending troops at that location immediately launched a fierce counterattack, and the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and retreated. In the northeast area of Baziqiao, the enemy dispatched engineers to repair the nearby bridges, attempting to advance. Our troops discovered this and immediately dispatched units to search the area. The enemy engineers retreated in haste, and the constructed fortifications were completely destroyed by our troops. Due to the rain, there was less enemy aircraft activity in the Jiangwan Dachan area.

### The Enemy's Attack on Liuhang Was Repelled by Us

Seizing Light Machine Guns, Rifles, Etc. - Few of the Several Hundred Enemy Troops Survived

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) There was a fierce battle in the Liuhang area at 8 PM last night. The location was about three li north of Liuhang. An enemy battalion launched a night attack. At first, there was no sound at all. They groped their way in the dark. When they approached our Chen position, they were discovered by our outposts, who opened fire. The enemy then lay down and stopped advancing. Our garrison immediately opened fire with rifles and machine guns, and prepared to attack with bayonets. The enemy knew that we were prepared, and dared not risk advancing. They responded with mortar fire, supporting the attack for about half an hour. Our troops leaped out of the trenches, charging fiercely from the middle, while the left and right flanks also quickly caught up, taking a position to encircle the enemy. The enemy then fled back. When they were chased to a distance of three or four hundred meters, an enemy company was surrounded by us and could not escape. The rest fled in the distance. Our company commander shouted for them to surrender. The enemy stubbornly refused, and then fired with machine guns. Before long, they were completely annihilated. More than a hundred rifles and five light machine guns were all seized. This was a complete victory for us. We then calmly withdrew to our Chen position and returned to our unit to await orders. Three of us were admitted to the hospital for treatment this morning." This battle is enough to show the bravery of our troops.

### Our Troops are Fully Prepared in Pudong

If the Enemy Attacks, They Will Be Resolutely and Fiercely Attacked

The Japanese troops are planning to attack our defensive position in Pudong, but have not yet taken any active action. In recent days, although some armed motorboats have raided various ports at times, it is only a guerilla strategy. Therefore, once they are swept by our machine guns, they will quickly flee and dare not linger. At present, although the situation in Pudong is on the verge of a major war due to the Japanese army's adoption of various necessary measures, the surface is still very calm. According to general observations, the enemy's attempt to occupy Pudong has never been forgotten. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the large amount of coal stored in the old Sanjing, new Sanjing, new Sanling, and old Baidu Nisshin Osaka and other various warehouses in Pudong has been under our control, which has made it difficult for Japanese warships to obtain fuel. Therefore, attacking Pudong is quite urgent, because the Japanese ships in the Huangpu River are threatened by our artillery fire. As for their attack goal, it is said to be in the Chunjiang Wharf area, which may not be credible, because there are many foreign factories in that area, such as the British Yizhong Tobacco Factory, Longmao Warehouse, Lunchang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and Xiangsheng Iron Factory, which occupy a very large area. If the Japanese army ignores everything and forcibly wants to land in that area, then tens of millions of foreign properties will be reduced to ashes. Therefore, the enemy's repeated raids on Chunjiang Wharf are also a strategic action. However, our army is also aware of the importance of Pudong and has made absolutely full preparations. If the enemy attacks, we will resolutely and fiercely attack. The entire Pudong line is still very quiet. This morning at 2:00 AM, there was only a brief artillery battle. At 8:00 AM, there was only a renewed artillery battle, with no fierce action. At 9:00 AM, an enemy plane circled over Laiyidu, dropped two bombs, and swept with machine guns, leaving after an hour.

According to the Central News Agency, four enemy planes began to spy on Pudong in the faint light of dawn, circling for a long time. They swept with machine guns and dropped more than a dozen small bombs in Lujiazui, Yangjiadu, Dongjiadu, and other places, and then flew away around 10:00 AM.

### The Retreating Troops Defeated the Enemy in One Battle

Killing More Than 30 Enemies and Wounding 4 or 5 - Seizing Machine Guns, Rifles, and Military Supplies

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) After our army retreated to the first line of defense, the vanguard troops of the □□□ Division stationed near the downtown area were ordered to hold their position and retreat slowly. Mr. Wang, who was wounded last night, came to Shanghai. A reporter interviewed him at a certain place, listening to his account of the magnificent last battle at the original position, which is worth recording. Mr. Wang said, "At dawn on the 14th, our army had already reorganized its troops and moved to a new position. The points occupied by our eight platoons were ordered by the commander to be moved only after three hours before leaving the defensive line. At this time, the enemy's artillery fire was fierce, averaging two cannons per minute. We were bombarded with bullets raining down all around us. This lasted for about an hour before the artillery fire stopped. More than a hundred enemy troops attacked forward, about a hundred meters away. We fired intensively with rifles and threw hand grenades, and we saw dozens of people fall one after another. The rest retreated in panic, probably because the enemy was timid and thought that our army was prepared and still dared not risk advancing. At that time, three of us were also wounded. The remaining × people took the opportunity to come out of the trenches to search and saw 35 enemy corpses. Except for four or five seriously wounded, the rest were all dead. We seized two machine guns, 28 rifles, and many other military supplies. So, we calmly and unhurriedly withdrew from the Chen position after the time limit arrived, returned to the team, and waited for orders. Three of us were able to be admitted to the hospital for treatment this morning." This battle shows the bravery of our troops.

### Our Troops Hold the Houjiamuqiao Defensive Position

Only Two Japanese Among the Fifteen Prisoners

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) At Houjiamuqiao, several miles northeast of Miaohang, the defensive position held by our company has remained unmoved since the outbreak of the war. Previously, Cao Ping once relied on this stronghold to rush to the Huangpu River, but unfortunately failed due to the pressure of the enemy's aircraft and artillery, so he retreated to the original position. Now, although most of our main defensive line has been moved to the first line of defense, the Houjiamuqiao defensive position is still being firmly defended because its situation is extremely important. Since the enemy boastfully declared the order to attack Nanhuaing before the 15th of this month, the enemy has been attacking with all their strength from the 10th until last night, and the artillery fire has not stopped. The river course in that area is curved, and the defensive line is tortuous. The enemy and our troops are facing each other across the river, and laughter can be heard when they are close to each other, and the distance is only a few dozen meters even when they are far apart. However, compared to the defensive lines of the two sides, the enemy troops are subject to greater side fire, so their losses are also greater. The night before, the enemy crossed the river bay and were captured by us. Among the fifteen prisoners, only two were Japanese, and the rest were our compatriots from the Northeast who were forced to come here, saying that they had long had the intention of turning against the enemy, but had no opportunity. They were always properly sent to the rear to show preferential treatment.

### Forcing Residents to Carry Munitions

Residents of Hongkou and Hudong Under Enemy Violence

According to the Central News Agency, in order to replenish its military strength, the enemy has been transporting military supplies and ammunition to Shanghai by enemy transport ships in recent days. They are now mostly unloaded at Shunshan Merchants' North Warehouse, Middle Warehouse, Osaka, and Huangpu wharves and warehouses. However, because there is a great shortage of porters, they have forcibly forced some residents of Hongkou and Yangshupu to carry them. If they are used improperly, they will be shot or even killed. Therefore, there have been many Chinese people at various wharves in recent days who have been forced to help transport the materials under the supervision of the enemy army, especially at Shushan Wharf. This is also why the enemy suddenly banned residents of the Shanghai East District from leaving. Alas, our people are suffering.

### Our Troops Have the Upper Hand on the Zhejiang Seafront, Jinpu, and Pinghan Lines

Fierce Fighting Between the Two Armies in the Jiyuji Station Area - Our Troops in Gu'an Are Fighting a Bloody Battle with the Enemy - Fierce Battle at Heilongguan Lasted for Two Days and Nights

[Jinan] Lu Xi, the battle last night, our army has a great advantage. The battle is two or three miles away from Jinan. According to the afternoon telegram, the artillery fire in the Yu Jizhan area is very fierce. White smoke can be seen in Yaoguantun Gu. The enemy fired more than 30 shots, and the battle is in full swing. An enemy plane flew early to Zhuanhe Cangxian Panxian to conduct reconnaissance. In the afternoon, it flew back and forth over the Jin Yao Guanguan Tun between the lines between Yufuhe Songjiaqiaokoumen. On the 15th, at 3:00 AM, Shelong was rushing to close the air and do post-disaster engineering. Kong Xiangrong inspected along the Yellow River and scheduled to visit Zhengjia Temple Koumen after the 16th. At 6:00 PM, it was reported that I had recovered Yu Jizhan and captured the prisoners on Yu Ji Street. There were only more than 700 Japanese soldiers, (Special Telegram on the 15th)

[Baoding] 5,000 enemies landed on the Yongding River within the Gu'an territory on the 15th, with the most intense artillery fire and aircraft cover. Although most of my regiment was martyred, they still used all their courage to fight the enemy. Now they have opened a battle line in Gongcun, west of Gu'an City. My soldiers are determined to die for their country, and they are fighting the enemy with their blood and bravery. The fierce battle raged all day on the 15th, and there was still no time to rest when the telegram was sent. At Heilongguan on the right wing of Pinghan, the enemy again reinforced their troops on the 15th. Our troops fought a bloody battle against the enemy. After two days and nights of fierce fighting on the 14th and 15th, we have gained an advantage. Also, enemy aircraft flew three times over the Pinghan Line and dropped bombs on the 15th. The major stations of Liangxiangnan Baodingbei were all bombed. (Special Telegram on the 15th)

### The League of Nations Administrative Council Deals with the Sino-Japanese Dispute

Discussed at 4:00 PM Today - Japanese Observer Submits Documents

[Geneva] Regarding the complaint filed by China, the League of Nations Administrative Council is scheduled to be submitted for discussion at 4:00 PM tomorrow afternoon. According to a visit by a Havas News Agency reporter, the Administrative Council will at that time act in accordance with Article 3, Paragraph 3 of the League of Nations Covenant, (When the Assembly is in session, it may deal with any event within the scope of the League of Nations or relating to world peace,) transfer the complaint filed by China to the League of Nations Assembly, and entrust the Sino-Japanese Question Advisory Committee, which was established by the League of Nations Provisional Assembly on February 24, 1933, to handle it. The committee will resume its work and will be attended by the United States and the permanent member states of the Administrative Council, namely, England, France, and the Soviet Union. In addition, the complaint filed by China is based on Articles 10, 11, and 17 of the League of Nations Covenant, among which Articles 11 and 17 will probably be avoided, because (1) Article 11 has the meaning of recognizing that a state of war already exists between China and Japan, or it may promote the United States to implement the Neutrality Act, which is very unfavorable to China, (2) According to the provisions of Article 17, it is bound to invite Japan to assume the obligations of the member states of the League of Nations and negotiate a peaceful solution, which the country will definitely refuse, (Central News Agency, Havas Radio, 15th)

[Geneva] Dr. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China attending the League of Nations, gave a speech at the National Assembly yesterday, expounding the situation in the Far East that requires urgent response with perseverance and calmness. His words have aroused deep impressions from all walks of life in the League of Nations. In his conclusion, Dr. Gu Chen said that there are three things that the League of Nations can do: (1) The League of Nations Administrative Council itself considers and acts, (2) Formally submit this issue to the League of Nations Assembly, (3) Submit this matter to the Advisory Committee established in 1933 to handle Sino-Japanese disputes. It is expected that the League of Nations will probably adopt the third strategy. The Chinese government's own expectations for the actions of the League of Nations seem to lie in this. The Administrative Council can handle this in its early meeting. The Advisory Committee consists of 23 countries and still exists. The Soviet Union is a member of the Administrative Council and will naturally occupy a seat on this committee. This is almost inevitable. This Advisory Committee will ask Japan to explain its reasons without forcing Japan to accept any obligations of the League of Nations.

### Brief Comments

— Xiang

The current society is definitely not a society of individualism. The current country is definitely not a country of the Monroe Doctrine era. Natural disasters are prevalent. The country has generations. The meaning of mutual assistance. Has been the same since ancient times. It is because neither individuals nor countries can exist independently of the world. The current world situation is so serious because of one mistake: the self-interest concept was too deep in the past, and everything was based on its own interests, ignoring public justice and humanity. Second, because of the affair, it could not be decisive and decisive, and I still hoped for the safety and comfort of the event. It is sitting on these two ends and being broken by the militarists one by one, forming this irreparable phenomenon. The former car has overturned. Lai Zhen is coming. Previous events are teachers and can be learned from. As the saying goes, "If you do things smoothly, will you travel thousands of miles and help others? Or would you rather leave the country and see the army?" Those who can distinguish the advantages and disadvantages must be there.

### A Painful Memory (4)

— By Our Special Correspondent, Uncle Di

㊃ Concerning General Song Zheyuan and the 29th Army

At this critical juncture for the nation's survival, our primary concern is the success or failure of the overall situation, not the merits or demerits of any single individual. After the loss of Beiping and Tianjin, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's declaration of not investigating Song's merits or demerits can be considered the most righteous and forceful. However, since the emergence of the special situation in Hebei and Chahar, Song has consistently been the key figure bearing the heavy responsibility on one side. Moreover, the recent fall of Beiping and Tianjin falls within his purview of responsibility. Therefore, his personal merits, demerits, wisdom, and folly have become a matter of public concern.

We must understand that since assuming leadership of Hebei and Chahar, Song has played the role of an unfortunate protagonist in a tragicomedy this past year. Nominally, he was the highest authority of two provinces and two cities. In reality, twenty counties in Hebei Province were lost, six counties in northern Chahar were lost, and two puppet organizations stood in opposition to him. On the Japanese side, he was regarded as one of the potential puppet candidates for the future, and he was constantly threatened with expulsion to force him to "clarify his position." The petty traitors, on one hand, outwardly served him with utmost obsequiousness, instigating him to oppose the central government so that they could carry out some clandestine activities under his cover. On the other hand, relying on Japanese power, they often fooled him, secretly carrying out preparations to replace him. These wealthy and corrupt elements wanted to use him as a shield for restoring Confucian classics, while in the eyes of some radical youth, he had become a potential quasi-traitor. What pained him most was that his subordinates, because of the instigation of petty traitors, showed a tendency to gradually deviate from him.

Two years ago, he was a distinctly anti-Japanese national hero; now he is a general guilty of losing territory and forfeiting rights. His subordinates are alienated from him, the people suspect him. Looking back, they must truly feel the gulf between heaven and earth.

Dealing with such a complex and difficult situation in North China was not something that someone like Song, who came from a military background, could handle. In the past two years, the predicament and deception he has encountered deserve our sympathy in some respects. No need to mention things far away, for example, not long before the fall of Beiping and Tianjin, when Song was returning to Beiping from Tianjin, the traitors colluded with the Japanese and actually planted a bomb on the road his special train was passing. Fortunately, it exploded after his train had passed, otherwise, he would have followed in Zhang Zuolin's footsteps. Also, for example, when the battle of Fengtai broke out, when Song went out of the city for inspection, traitors in Beiping, such as Qi Xieyuan and Zhang Bi, and Pan Yugui openly held a meeting, planning to refuse his return to Beiping. In Tianjin, when he visited Xiangyue, he was clearly expressing condolences for the death of Tashiro, but Chen Juesheng, the translator, actually translated it as an apology for the Lugouqiao Incident. As a result, Xiangyue thought that his facial expressions showed no sincerity of apology, and he suffered a round of ridicule. Until the end, he was deceived by Zhang Zizhong's feigned repentance, and Zhang suddenly betrayed him, forcing him to flee Beiping in the middle of the night. Even many senior officials, such as Deng Zhexi, had no idea in advance. The embarrassing situation can be imagined.

As for the evaluation of Song, we should not make a general conclusion even now. We should look at his future actions before making a judgment.

Regarding the 29th Army, the outside world already knows two points: 1. Anti-Japanese sentiment is very high – especially among lower-level officers and soldiers. 2. It is not a modern army. These two points are completely true. For example, in this battle in the Beiping-Tianjin area, these two advantages and disadvantages were fully revealed. Regarding the former, the spirit of the Dare-to-Die Squad at Lugouqiao fighting hard, the bloody battle of a battalion in Langfang, especially the sacrifice of more than two thousand people in Nanyuan, can truly move heaven and earth and make ghosts cry. An officer told me:

"As soon as the battle starts, the brothers all want to rush out of the trenches and can't be stopped at all."

Regarding the latter, such as the lack of defensive fortifications, the lack of heavy weapons, the absence of mechanized units, etc., are enough to show that it is not a modern army. In the past two years, the four provinces and cities of Hebei, Chahar, Beiping, and Tianjin had a monthly income of nearly four million yuan, which was used only for the large-scale expansion of the army. There was no progress in terms of weapons and equipment. The worst thing is that not only has the material aspect failed to modernize, but they fundamentally doubt the importance of modernization itself. Although they sometimes can't stand the enemy's mechanical pressure and suffer miserable defeats, they are unwilling to abandon the prejudice that courage is more important than weapons. The defect of such a non-modernized mindset is a more serious problem than the defect of non-modernized equipment. In the battle to seize the bridge at Lugouqiao, our Dare-to-Die Squad achieved great results in hand-to-hand combat. However, in the subsequent battles of Langfang and Fengtai, the enemy used aircraft for reconnaissance, used signals and radio for command, and fought with various heavy weapons. Our army could not see the other side's troops at all. The Dare-to-Die Squad could not have infinite courage, and there was no way to engage in hand-to-hand combat.

However, in this anti-Japanese war in Beiping and Tianjin, the reason why the 29th Army suffered a total defeat and had to withdraw from Beiping and Tianjin was not purely due to the inferiority of weapons, which made it impossible to defend. We should not be overly superstitious about weapons. The 29th Army, which defended Lugouqiao, had only one or two regiments, and they were able to support for two or three weeks. Until the night of the 28th, the total number of people lost by the entire 29th Army was only fifteen or sixteen thousand. With the 29th Army, which was known as 150,000 and actually had 120,000 capable of fighting, it was absolutely not at the point of disintegration at this time. And the reason why it collapsed like soup pouring out of a pot is something that everyone finds very incomprehensible. Here, the reporter wants to point out two points: 1. Improper command, 2. Internal disagreement.

The 29th Army is a very traditional army, and it is fundamentally difficult for anyone other than the old figures from the Northwest Army era to gain a foothold. The lack of command and staff talent is very alarming. The only staff talent is Qin Decun, who graduated from the Army University. However, since being provoked by petty traitors and labeled with "Central Clique" and "Anti-Japanese Faction" and other such titles, Qin's position as the mayor of Beiping has been shaken, and his words are no longer trusted by Song. Other than him, Fu Zhan Kui and Xu Tingyao are relatively inferior. Besides them, it can be said that there is no fourth. Most of the 29th Army came from the military ranks, and their courage in battle is first-class. However, in terms of command, the major defects shown this time almost made it impossible for it to fight against the Japanese modern army. They always dealt with things piecemeal and never used the entire function of the army to make achievements in strategy. When such a disastrous situation occurred on the 28th, no one in the 29th Army, including Song, could come up with another plan to support it. Therefore, there was only retreat.

The biggest fatal injury of the 29th Army's collapse this time, of course, still lies in its internal disunity. Qin Decun and Feng Zhi'an were the main war faction, Zhang Zizhong and a few pro-Japanese elements were the main peace faction, and Liu Ruming and Zhao Dengyu had no preconceived notions. In addition, coupled with Song Zheyuan's indecisiveness and the provocation of petty traitors, a situation of collapse had already formed long before the major defeat on the 28th. Someone would advise Song, why keep Zhang Zizhong in Beiping and not let him return to Tianjin and hand over the army to Lu Zhonglin for command. Then, why not formally dismiss him and replace him with Lu Zhonglin? However, Song did not have such courage. It was not until the night of the 28th that Zhang Zizhong's attitude suddenly changed, that he had to flee in a hurry. This is a hidden danger that Song fostered.

This reporter, who fled from Beiping and Tianjin to the south this time... has encountered such questions many times: "Is Song Zheyuan good or bad? Is the 29th Army a good army or a bad army?"

In fact, I think this is asking too generally. The general situation, I have roughly described above. If you want to answer in general, then I think it is okay to say this: If you simply let him lead troops, then Mr. Song Zheyuan is still a good officer. As for the 29th Army, if it is modernized, then it is indeed a good army of the country.

The heavy responsibility of the four provinces and cities of Hebei, Chahar, Beiping, and Tianjin fell on Song and the 29th Army under a special situation. Being able to endure the harsh environment for two years without falling into decline and being able to maintain territorial sovereignty for two years without change can be considered as having completed their mission. As for their inability to support this very serious situation, it was originally expected by us and should not be criticized too harshly. However, from the beginning of this incident until the fall of Beiping and Tianjin, during this period, the central government had instructions on good strategies several times, but they never complied, resulting in an unmanageable situation. This is a painful thing and also the fault of Song and the authorities of the 29th Army. The past is gone, may they strive for the future to win the final good evaluation of the people.
