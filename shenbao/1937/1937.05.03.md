### Bandit-Puppet Activities in Chahar Province Surge Again

Troop Increase at Nanhaoqian in Shangdu, Spying on Suiyuan East's Xinghe Area, etc.
Ueda to Inspect Jiabusi Soon
It is Said that Zuo Yi Returned to Suiyuan from Pingdiquan

[Guihua] Chahar bandit-puppet troop movements are reportedly still frequent recently. According to a certain general, besides having redeployed one division of elite troops towards Shangdu, the bandit-puppets have also increased the number of infantry regiments by two in the Nanhaoqian area. Together with the two regiments of Mongolian cavalry originally stationed there, they now have a total force of four regiments. Furthermore, they have added many radio stations in the Shangdu Nanhaoqian area. Their intentions seem to be to spy on Xinghe and other areas in the eastern part of our Suiyuan province. Our forward-line national troops have undergone rest and training in recent days, and their strength has doubled. It will be extremely difficult for the bandit-puppets to succeed. It is also rumored that the bandit-puppets recently appointed Wang Ying, Liu Guitang, and Xia Ziming to separately lead teams of bandits. When necessary, they will be sent to Chahar North and Suiyuan East to join the bandit gangs in attacking our territory. Moreover, An Hualing, seeing the increasingly tense situation in Suiyuan East, decided to return to Suiyuan East in three days to reorganize his troops. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 2nd)

[Zhangjiakou] Recently, Chahar puppet troops often form groups of dozens and sneak into the border villages of Suiyuan East to loot horses and property, resembling their past provocations before attacking Suiyuan.

A certain party is expanding the Duolun airfield on a large scale, and the work is intense. Furthermore, poppies have been planted everywhere in northern Chahar. Those limited to fifteen mu are planting one mu, and those with more land can plant as they please, implementing a policy of poisoning. (Special dispatch from the 2nd)

Now, the government of my country has decided to set up a position of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in your country and ordered me to serve as the first envoy. I am deeply willing to do my best to develop the cultural and economic relations between our two countries, because although the two countries are far apart, we should strive to communicate in terms of cultural ideas, and it is especially necessary to promote business relations in international common life. It is hoped that your Excellency Mr. Chairman and the government of your country will give assistance so that I can fulfill my duties in this famous country. "Chairman's Reply" Your Excellency Mr. Envoy, your Excellency the Envoy came in person with the credentials of the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Finland to China, issued by the President of your country. I am very happy to accept it. The decision of your government to send an Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to be stationed in this country is enough to show the great intention to promote the friendship between our two countries. I am especially pleased that your Excellency the Envoy has been honored to be the first envoy to come to this country.

[Nanjing] Jiang Baocheng, head of the Guizhou branch of the China Foreign Famine Relief Committee, arrived in Nanjing representing various public bodies of Guizhou to report the disaster situation to central government departments and seek assistance. According to him, Guizhou Province has unfortunately suffered a severe drought since last summer, with no rainfall to this day. The Nanming River, which has never dried up in thousands of years, has now become a natural, uneven road. Drinking water is severely difficult to obtain in various counties, with each load costing four or five dimes, and a single vegetable stem costing a dime, but even then, they are impossible to buy. The poor initially ate fern roots and tree bark, but recently they have been substituting it with white clay, also known as Guanyin powder. Those who eat it swell up and die within a few days. The various tragic situations are too numerous to describe. The Central Government has already issued 100,000 yuan for urgent relief and sent personnel to distribute it, but the disaster area has spread to more than sixty counties, affecting over three million people. This is a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem. It is hoped that the central authorities and national charitable organizations will continue to provide relief; otherwise, in a few months, the seven million people may face utter extinction.

### On the National Defense Line (I)

—Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Shudi

㊀ Introduction

Without mincing words, there are some hostile relations between China and Japan, at least in the current situation. To put it bluntly, our current main relationship with Japan consists of only two words: "national defense." Only on this concrete basis can there be so-called "normal diplomacy," and only then can there be so-called "coexistence and co-prosperity" and "friendship," etc. Recalling when the Shanghai Armistice Agreement was signed in the 21st year, the Japanese side spared no effort in haggling over the term "hostile"; however, in addition to the fact that the three northeastern provinces had already been occupied, what followed was the outbreak of the war in the passes of the Great Wall, with the Japanese taking advantage of China's internal and external crises and pursuing us all the way to the city of Peiping and Tianjin. The ancient old capital spent its days of panic under the sound of cannons and planes. In this way. There followed the Tanggu Armistice Agreement in the summer of the 22nd year. Since then, Peiping and Tianjin have become the front line of our national defense, and the territory north of the Yellow River has been completely exposed to the enemy's iron hooves. In those two or three years, our material and spiritual losses were difficult to calculate quantitatively. However, we did get something in return in a passive way. What was the price?

A. The mentality of complacency has been shattered: B. The future relationship between China and Japan will be entirely built on the comparison of strength. The deduction is: ㊀ Not relying on the League of Nations, ㊁ Not engaging in empty talk about friendship. In the past two or three years, the hard work of the whole country and the calls overflowing in the hearts of men, women and children all over the country have been:

㊀ Do everything possible to engage in economic and national defense construction,

㊁ Gritting our teeth and engaging in the movement of peaceful unification.

Hard work and cries, in these two or three years, have gone through countless twists and turns. Its achievements, one by one, have concrete facts placed before us. It is inconvenient to describe them in detail here, and there is no need to be complacent. We can simply report one sentence to the readers: The reason why we were able to stop the Suiyuan Anti-Japanese War last year under the circumstances of our victory and the defection of the puppet army, and allow us to regain our self-confidence and raise our international prestige, is that it was a little effect of our national hard work and cries over the past two or three years. The enemy's estimation of us is extremely accurate!

At the same time as our preparation, the so-called "specialization" movement carried out by the Japanese in North China in the past two or three years, the so-called "anti-communist agreement" proposed to our government, and all kinds of sabotage and intimidation work there, had the ultimate purpose of trying to cut off our roots before we had stood firm; but the Suiyuan War last year, at least before the enemy had cut off our roots, we finally stood firm! From then on, we showed a strong "national defense" in North China.

Now let's explain the term "national defense line." Strictly speaking, before the Suiyuan Anti-Japanese War, on the surface, we could not talk about any "national defense"; but in reality, we had no so-called national defense "line" in North China in particular. The enemy's piece of paper could force us to withdraw our troops. As long as the ronin sneaked in, the traitors and villains in that area immediately flocked together, causing the political and social institutions to completely change their colors. As a result, the enemy's garrison in Peiping and Tianjin increased significantly. The puppet regimes of "Jidong" and "Chabei" appeared one after another. In the morning, our front line of national defense was in Peiping and Tianjin, but by night, it might have reached the line between Baoding and Cangzhou. In the morning, our front line of national defense was in Chabei, Suidong, and Jinbei, but by night, it might have reached the southern part of Shanxi and Ningli. As far as the situation at that time was concerned, those of us engaged in the news business, of course, understood the government's and local authorities' determination to defend the country better than the general readers; but at that time, if we were to clearly draw the outline of a national defense "line," it would have been quite difficult. What was especially painful for us was to see the loss of self-confidence of the compatriots who lived in the forefront of the national defense at that time, and on the contrary, a large number of traitors appeared. The reporter certainly knew when the sounds of cannons shook Peiping and Tianjin in the 22nd year that some compatriots were preparing to welcome the enemy's flag. And in the 24th year, when the "Jidong" puppet organization appeared, I saw a large number of compatriots flocking to it. (Among them, there were people with high knowledge, and even friends of the reporter personally and from all walks of life in Peiping and Tianjin.) When Guyuan and even "Chabei" were lost, the reporter personally saw the soldiers who resisted alone in the local area, and finally ran out of ammunition and supplies, escaping to the inland area in despair and complaining. All in all, we felt that the future was shrouded in darkness! When the darkness was heavy, a group of relatively clear-headed people were, of course, gritting their teeth and engaging in hard work and cries; but those compatriots who did not understand showed complacency, decadence, and even willingly became traitors. This is exactly what Mr. Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Committee, called in the welcoming meeting for all sectors of Suiyuan: "A very painful phenomenon!" In the dark of night, where was there any national defense "line" to speak of!

However, the Suiyuan War finally broke out—this, on the one hand, was naturally a declaration of the determination of the government and local authorities, and provided a concrete explanation for the "determination to make the final sacrifice" repeatedly emphasized by the central government; on the other hand, it also aroused the self-confidence of the compatriots across the country, and promoted the defection of a large number of people whose conscience had not been extinguished. To sum up, this is certainly the starting point of our national revival. However, just in terms of the Suiyuan War itself, one of its greatest effects was: to use its light to break through the darkness and illuminate the following clear front "line" of our national defense in North China. That is, the maximum extent of our concession.

This front line of national defense is as follows: Starting from Tianjin, along the Beining Line to Peiping, north to Juyongguan along the Ping-Sui Line; entering the territory of Chahar, along the Great Wall, passing through Yanqing, Yicheng, Dushikou, and Longguan. To Zhangjiakou; along the Ping-Sui Road to Yanggao, in northern Shanxi: north to Xinghe, Jining, and Taolin in eastern Suiyuan, to Wuchuan, Baotou, Wuyuan, Linhe, and all the way to Ningxia.

On November 24th of last year, Bailing Temple was recovered, followed by the recovery of the Great Temple. The light of these two battles once again pointed out to us in North China, in a hazy way, the second "line" of national defense. That second "line" is as follows: From the border line between the Ulanchab League in Suiyuan and the Xilingol League in Chahar, passing through the central part of Chahar; going south, along the border between Rehe and Chahar, to Gubeikou: going east, along the Great Wall to Shanhaiguan.

Combining the performances of all aspects inside and outside since the Suiyuan War, we have dared to clearly determine that for the front line of national defense, our whole country has made the greatest determination and firmly defended it. From the enemy's point of view, if they want to cross this "line" by one step, then they must exchange it for a higher sacrifice and loss; from our point of view, if this "line" is abandoned by one more step, then unless our whole country has reached the end of its rope. As for the completion of the second "line," it is the urgent cry of our whole country; in order to complete it, we put the two major principles of recovering "Chabei" and "Jidong" on the current work. If this "line" is not completed for one day, North China will not be able to rest easy for one day; and the diplomatic relations between China and Japan will not be able to enter the normal track for one day, and will eventually remain in a hostile state.

Therefore, it occurs to us that compatriots all over the country must unanimously keep the following two questions in mind: Under what conditions is the tenacity of our national defense's first "line" of defense? Second, it follows from this: In the near future, can our national defense's front line be moved to the second "line"?

I, the reporter, am also one of the people who have the above two questions and are eager to find answers; this time, at the dispatch of this newspaper, I personally ran to the front of the national defense and made a rough investigation on all aspects, so as to report to the readers. However, what I regret is that some places could not be seen due to various relationships, some places could not be fully investigated due to various restrictions, some places I personally saw, but could not, and could not report to everyone; some places, although they could be reported, but for the sake of caution, I only took the side comprehensive method; ... ... All this is the suffering that we have to endure in this extraordinary period.

What is the overall impression? Here, I would like to borrow the words "Don't worry!" which have been repeatedly repeated to me by the authorities of the three provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shanxi, as well as people from all walks of life on the front line, and report them to the readers first.

When I wrote this "Introduction," I had already completed the process of investigation, and the investigation note was about to be completed. I am writing this out and publishing it at the front. The order of my journey this time was from Chahar to Suiyuan to Shanxi; but in the order of publication of the investigation note, it was from Shanxi to Suiyuan to Chahar.

### Educating Youth to Know Their Motherland

— Feng Youlan

The summer vacation for schools is approaching again. What methods can be used to provide students with an education during the summer vacation that they cannot obtain in the classroom or laboratory at school?

We currently place too much emphasis on tangible education. For example, teaching students to read, conduct experiments, and listen to lectures are all forms of tangible education. While tangible education is undoubtedly essential, the concept of education is not limited to this. There is also a type of education called intangible education. This type of education does not rely on students reading or listening to lectures, but instead uses other methods to subtly influence and transform students, allowing them to correct their faults and improve themselves without realizing it. Education regarding knowledge must necessarily rely on tangible education, but as for education regarding morality, relying solely on tangible education may not be effective. “The people are transformed by music and beauty.” This is an old saying, but it is a truth. Strictly speaking, we cannot simply “teach” people to be moral; we must also “transform” them to be moral. The education that young students receive at school on a daily basis is mostly tangible education; during the summer vacation, we should provide them with opportunities to receive a little of the intangible education that they cannot receive at school on a daily basis.

Patriotism is a virtue. To teach a person to be patriotic, it is not only necessary to teach them that they should be patriotic, but also to cultivate a patriotic character in them. Teaching people that they should be patriotic can be done through tangible education. We can teach them to memorize many patriotic maxims and tell them many patriotic stories. However, whether relying solely on these can cultivate a patriotic character in them is a question. Character must be “cultivated.” Throughout history, we have seen many people who have read the Four Books and Five Classics fluently, but later became rebellious and treacherous officials. In terms of their knowledge, did they not know that they should be loyal ministers and filial sons? However, they only had that knowledge but not the character of loyal ministers and filial sons, so when they reached a critical juncture, they did things that they knew they should not do.

If we want to teach our youth to be patriotic, the best way is to directly place the lovable aspects of their country before their eyes, teaching them to truly see the lovableness of their country. The current Chinese people have too little knowledge of China. They may have been to New York and London, but not to Nanjing and Beijing. They may have been to Rome and Athens, but not to Xi'an and Luoyang. They may have traveled all over the famous mountains of Europe and America, but not climbed Mount Tai or Mount Hua. In this situation, how can we teach them not to say that everything foreign is better than everything Chinese? How can we teach them to spontaneously develop a love and protection for China from the depths of their hearts, unable to restrain themselves?

From these perspectives, I think our government should, when schools have their summer vacations, assemble many trains to allow students from various places to travel to various places to see. It would be best if it were completely free, but if it cannot be completely free, only a nominal fare should be charged. Furthermore, various experts should be dispatched to lead them, explaining what they see to them at any time. Let them go to Henan and Shaanxi, and teach them to imagine the prosperity of the Shang, Zhou, Han, and Tang dynasties. Let them go to Shandong and see the hometowns of Confucius and Mencius. Let them go to various places south of the Yangtze River to see the current construction of the government. When they arrive at a place and see something inspiring, let them sing at will, and let them cry at will.

Originally, some schools had so-called graduation trip subsidies for graduating students. However, many people thought that the so-called graduation trip was just to let students play around in various places. Schools could not take money to let them play, so many schools, following orders from above, abolished these subsidies. Those who hold this view really do not know the importance of intangible education. There are also people who believe that although visiting and traveling to various places is beneficial to students, these benefits should be bought by the students themselves and should not be given free of charge by the government. This view completely regards students as the sons of their fathers, rather than recognizing that students are not only the sons of their fathers but also the citizens of the country. They are citizens of the country, and the country should educate them. In the past, we said that the court supported scholars; now, the country should support scholars.

If we can get the majority of young students to visit the mausoleums of Qin Shihuang and Emperor Wu of Han once, the impact on the spirit of the youth will be better than sending many special envoys to sweep ethnic tombs. If we can get the majority of young people to visit the hometown of Confucius once, the impact on the spirit of the youth will be better than holding many Ding sacrifices. If we can get the majority of young people to actually see the government's efforts and achievements in construction, the impact on the spirit of the youth will be better than many propaganda from the official propaganda department.

Regarding the latter point mentioned above, we have facts to prove it. We all acknowledge that the education sector is much more stable now than it was last year. Since the beginning of the spring semester of this year, we have not heard of any so-called student movements. In schools, we also do not see any so-called left-wing and right-wing disputes among students. We only see schools teaching step by step, and we only see students studying diligently in a disciplined manner. If we compare the situation in schools this spring with that of last autumn and winter, there is almost a world of difference. Judging from the situation in schools, since the beginning of 1937, we have almost entered a new world. Why are we able to have such a good situation? The main reason can be said to be that the youth are gradually recognizing the government's internal and external efforts and achievements. Facts speak louder than words, and factual achievements placed before one's eyes have a more moving power than an unknown amount of propaganda in words and writing. The current situation in the education sector is a concrete proof. If we can use the methods mentioned above to better showcase all the efforts and achievements of the current government, it will definitely have a better impact on the youth.

The Ping-Sui Railway has had a Northwest Inspection Tour organization during the spring vacation for the past two or three years. Participants travel from Beiping to Suiyuan Baotou, taking a total of five or six days. During these five or six days, all round-trip tickets, food, lodging, and tour guide fees total only 20 yuan. This year, Ziling Temple was also added. Because the price is cheap, many people go. On the one hand, it is very uneconomical for the Railway Bureau to do this kind of losing business, but from the perspective of national defense and education, this method has great significance. We hope that the government and various railway bureaus will pay great attention to this type of method.

### The Liberal and Seiyukai Parties Win a Great Victory in the Japanese General Election

Occupying 80% of the 466 Seats, the Rapid Advance of the Social Mass Party is Extremely Noteworthy

[Tokyo] The final results of the Japanese general election: of the 466 seats in the Diet, the number of seats obtained by each party is as follows: the Liberal Party occupies 179 seats, the Seiyukai 175 seats, the Social Mass Party 37 seats, the Showa Society 19 seats, the Toho Society 11 seats, the Kokumin Domei 11 seats, other small factions 9 seats, and independent parties 25 seats. However, the position occupied by each party can be estimated according to the proportion of seats already won. The Liberal Party, the Seiyukai, and the Social Mass Party, the anti-government parties, together obtained 85% of the total number of seats. The almost unanimous disgust of the Japanese people for the current cabinet has been exposed without reservation.

Furthermore, the astonishing victory of the Social Mass Party and the disastrous defeat of the Showa Society and the Kokumin Domei form a noteworthy contrast in the results of this election. This morning, executives of the Seiyukai, the Liberal Party, and the Social Mass Party declared that if the Hayashi cabinet disregards the decision of the people and remains in power until the special session of the Diet at the end of August, they will not hesitate to pass a vote of no confidence at the beginning of the special session. At the same time, the Liberal and Seiyukai parties will continue to cooperate firmly to guard against the government's attempts to divide them. In fact, the current political crisis has no other way out except for the following three: ㊀ the entire cabinet resigns; ㊁ the Diet is dissolved again; ㊂ compromise. Many people feel that the Hayashi cabinet will not resign at least before the special session of the Diet is convened. If a vote of no confidence is indeed proposed, it will order the dissolution of the Diet and then immediately submit its resignation. However, there are still quite a few observers who tend to feel that a final compromise is not impossible. Prime Minister Hayashi held an important discussion with Shigenobu in the palace on the 1st regarding the government's attitude after the election results were fully revealed. It is said that an important statement will be made regarding this attitude after a final decision is made at a temporary cabinet meeting. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)

[Tokyo] A characteristic of yesterday's general election was that although the weather was good, there were many abstentions. According to figures released by the Ministry of Home Affairs, out of 13,938,456 voters nationwide, excluding the Ryukyu Islands, only 10,235,664 people voted. Therefore, the number of abstentions reached 3,702,792, accounting for 26.5% of the voters, an increase of 5.2% compared to the general election last year. The average abstention rate in rural areas was 34.7%, compared to 26.4% last year; the abstention rate in agricultural areas was 22.6%, compared to 19% last year; the abstention rate in Tokyo was 37.8%, compared to 26.8% last year; the abstention rate in Osaka was 64.3%, compared to 35.6% last year. According to Home Minister Kawahara's statement today, the increase in abstentions is due to the fact that the public treats the campaign speeches of political parties as abstract discussions and is unwilling to discuss concrete policies, which has gradually led to indifference. However, the opinions of political party leaders differ from this. According to the secretary-general of the Seiyukai, the public's indifference to the election is due to the government's unconstitutional dissolution of the Diet. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 1st)

### The Japanese Government Will Issue a Statement

Carefully Considering Its Attitude to Cope with the Political Situation

[Tokyo] The vote counting in the general election is scheduled to be completed on the 2nd. The government plans to decide on its attitude toward the new phase of the political situation at a cabinet meeting on the 3rd, and will issue a statement to the public both domestically and abroad on the same day. Chief Cabinet Secretary Ohashi visited Prime Minister Hayashi at 10:00 a.m. today, holding talks for three hours and deciding on the main points of the statement, which will be used as a basis to produce a statement for formal consultation with the cabinet. In particular, it hopes that newly elected Diet members will have a proper understanding of the situation and emphasizes that the government should work with these virtuous people to overcome the difficulties of the times. The discussions were all about the understanding of the situation and did not touch on policy issues. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)

[Tokyo] The new phase of the political situation has been completed with the Liberal and Seiyukai parties, which advocate anti-government policies, obtaining a majority. The government plans to issue a statement on the 3rd, and at the same time discuss the policies to be adopted for the future political situation and the special session of the Diet. Since the previous dissolution of the Diet was to morally correct the political parties' understanding of the situation, the result of the election shows that it would be meaningless for the current cabinet to hastily resign. Even if the political situation remains unchanged, any party, regardless of its affiliation, should cooperate with it and share the responsibility of dealing with the situation as long as there is a shared understanding. Prime Minister Hayashi strongly hopes that the newly elected Diet members will resolve to make proposals at the special session of the Diet that embody the current cabinet's unique policies. This point will be specially discussed with cabinet members at the cabinet meeting on the 3rd to prepare for coping with the future political situation. First, the issues of supplementing cabinet members and determining new policies must be decided in advance. At the latest, the supplement to cabinet members must be completed by the middle of this month, and then efforts must be made to concretize the new policies. Therefore, the political situation is aimed at the special session of the Diet, and the degree of tension will soon increase. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)

### Ambassador Kawagoe Returns to Tokyo

With Important Proposals for Adjusting Sino-Japanese Relations

[Tokyo] Japanese Ambassador to China Kawagoe returned to Tokyo on the 1st at 9:00 p.m. from Kobe. According to what he said to people in the car:

Sino-Japanese relations are encountering the most important opportunity in both countries. At this time, the Japanese side should determine concrete policies. The Chinese side has fully expressed its agreement with Foreign Minister Sato's abstract China policy stated in the Diet. In short, what form should be used to concretize it seems to be the focus of attention and expectation. The Chinese side must wait for Japan's specific plan to determine its attitude towards Sino-Japanese cooperation. Since these difficult Sino-Japanese relations cannot be resolved so simply, I feel that there is no need to rush to a solution. The ambassador is scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Sato on the afternoon of the 3rd to report in detail on the Chinese side's attitude towards Japan, the activities of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the actual situation, and then make important recommendations on future China policy. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)

[Tokyo] Ambassador Kawagoe returned to Kobe on the 30th aboard the Japanese ship Hakozaki Maru. He immediately gave a frank talk to reporters regarding the future relationship between China and Japan. He said that we should not be too pessimistic about Sino-Japanese relations. The atmosphere in Nanjing is not particularly bad. It is true that Sino-Japanese cooperation cannot be realized immediately, but we ourselves should establish a certain goal and then proceed. The adjustment of relations cannot be successful according to the wishes of one side. It is only possible after both sides have reached a consensus. I do not believe that the Nanjing government regards economic cooperation as completely impossible before the political issues are resolved. Regarding the East Hebei issue, Ambassador Kawagoe said that East Hebei is China's own problem. I think China's wish is to dissolve East Hebei so that it is not an independent organization. Since Sino-Japanese relations should be improved in general, Japan should assist as China hopes to achieve this improvement. Therefore, if the abolition of the East Hebei organization is beneficial to the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations in general, it should be dissolved. In short, if we still think that if Japan takes a step back, China will show arrogance one step further, and therefore Japan should not compromise, then the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations will not be possible. Kawagoe concluded by saying that the spirit of anti-Japanese resistance is undoubtedly the driving force for China's unification, but China should not be regarded as Japan's enemy, because on the one hand, China still admires Meiji Restoration Japan, and on the other hand, Japan does not intend to declare war on China. In short, I think fairness should be the key to our future policy towards China. Finally, Kawagoe expressed his regret for not being able to realize the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations during his tenure. As for whether he will resign in the future, he will decide after discussing with Foreign Minister Sato Naotake. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 1st)

[Tokyo] Ambassador to China Kawagoe returned home to report on his work and arrived in Kyoto today. Speaking of Sino-Japanese relations, he said that they can be adjusted with time. He also said that if it does not hinder Japan's interests, Anglo-Japanese cooperation in China is not impossible. Kawagoe continued to mention the East Hebei issue, saying that Japan cannot participate in the resolution of this issue and can only provide assistance. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 1st)

### Japanese Right-Wing Groups Criticize the Weakness of Diplomacy Towards China

Opposing the Abolition of the East Hebei Puppet Organization, the Tokyo Newspaper is also Spare No Effort in Promoting It

[Tokyo] According to the Yamato Shimbun today, more than fifty Japanese patriotic groups, including the Greater Japan Production Party, the Greater Transformation Society, the National Policy Society, and the Tsurunaki Society New Club, etc., expressed their indignation at the weakness of the Kasumigaseki policy and decided to launch a campaign to support the existence of the East Hebei puppet organization. A meeting of representatives of the aforementioned groups was held on April 30, at which it was decided that ㊀ North China and Japan-Manchukuo should be integrated to carry out economic aggression and liberate the local peasants, so as to establish the basis for cooperation between Far Eastern countries; ㊁ seek the support of the national masses for the sound development of the East Hebei organization, because it is the only comrade when Japan is now realizing its greatest hope in North China; ㊂ the "defeated diplomacy" towards China should be abandoned, and an independent diplomacy towards China must be established. Yesterday, the Asahi Shimbun also followed the example of the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun and published a large-format supplement to promote East Hebei. At the same time, the Miyako Shimbun and the Tokyo Shimbun continued to publicize their opposition to the abolition of East Hebei, with almost no difference in content or even wording, which was obviously from the same source. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 1st)

### Japan Attempts to Restore Anglo-Japanese Cooperation in the Far East

The Plan for the China Issue Contains Four Items, Shigeru Yoshida Inquires About the British Government's Attitude

[Washington] It was learned today from reliable sources that diplomats from various Asian countries plan to secretly conduct activities to adjust Far Eastern relations and stabilize the economies of Far Eastern countries, especially taking advantage of the coronation ceremony of the British King. Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Yoshida Shigeru is conducting exploratory talks in London. Philippine President Quezon passed through Europe and may discuss the issue of the permanent neutrality of the Philippine Islands after their independence from the United States with diplomatic circles in various European countries. Britain has been regarded as the main country to promote the neutrality treaty of the Philippine Islands. Japanese representatives here have stated that if the United States abandons the Philippine Islands as its naval and military base, Japan is willing to guarantee the neutrality of the Philippine Islands. (Guomin News Agency dispatch on the 30th)

[London] The diplomatic correspondent of the Times Weekly Special Edition recently declared that Japan now wants to restore the policy of Anglo-Japanese cooperation in the Far East. If the political situation in the country does not change after the results of the House of Representatives election are announced, then Ambassador to the United Kingdom Yoshida Shigeru plans to start negotiations with the British government. The plan proposed by Japan can be divided into four items: ㊀ Japan is willing to respect China's territorial integrity; ㊁ Britain recognizes the importance of all of Japan's interests in northern China, without necessarily recognizing "European countries"; ㊂ Britain, Japan, the United States, and France will jointly lend funds to China; ㊃ China and Japan will establish a friendship treaty. However, the British government will inevitably hesitate and consider the aggressive policy of a section of Japanese warlords towards China before it is abandoned. "And one thing is now absolutely certain is that Britain will not take any action in the Far East unless it obtains the consent of the United States, especially the support of the United States." As for Anglo-Japanese business relations, they have been improved since Japan established business agreements with Australia, India, and Burma, and a Japanese economic survey mission is scheduled to arrive in London in early August.

In addition, the Electra aviation field near the city of Logroño (east of the city of Burgos), which was established by the rebellious army, currently has 40 German and Italian aircraft stationed there. The rebel airfield in Vitoria also has 70 foreign aircraft stationed there. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 2nd)

[London] Bilbao, Spain, claimed that 1,500 German troops had recently arrived at the port of San Sebastián, Spain. Berlin has firmly denied this, considering it to be a complete fabrication from beginning to end. However, the Bilbao report further stated that when the German troops arrived in San Sebastián, the local authorities suddenly issued an air raid warning, causing the public to run into their houses to avoid being seen before the German troops landed. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 2nd)

⊙ Hendaye Government warships today also took the offensive together with the army, bombarding the ports under the control of the rebellious army in the Bay of Biscay, such as Lequeitio and San Sebastián, to contain the rebellious army attacking Bilbao. (Guomin News Agency dispatch on the 1st)

⊙ Port of Bilbao Yesterday, the Nationalists advanced towards the vicinity of the Port of Guernica, north of this port. The government army resisted bravely, and armed fishing boats fired artillery to coordinate and inflict heavy casualties. At the same time, those attacking the Monastery of San Martín were attacked by the government army's bombing squad, but retreated due to the arrival of Nationalist aircraft for support. In short, after the government army bravely resisted in this area, morale has been greatly boosted. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 2nd)

⊙ City of Vitoria (Havas dispatch on the 2nd) The Nationalists continued to make progress on the Basque front yesterday, immediately occupying nine villages and towns, including the port of Bermeo (the port through which most of the Port of Bilbao's food supply is imported), and camping at Cape Machichaco. Cape Machichaco is the gateway to the Port of Bilbao and is in a very important position. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 2nd)

### Evacuation of Women and Children Begins in Bilbao

Assisted by British and French Navies

⊙Bordeaux, France - Several thousand refugees from the port of Bilbao have been transported by several British destroyers and the French light cruiser "Somme" and are expected to arrive in batches in this port today and tomorrow. The authorities are now taking various measures to find food and lodging for the refugees. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 1st)

[London] Non-combatants in Bilbao are about to begin leaving the country. Nine British ships anchored in the port of Bilbao, most of which broke through the Nationalist blockade to reach the port, have agreed to load as many women and children as possible and transport them to Saint-Jean-de-Luz in France. Approximately five thousand women and children will be transported to that location, and then transported by British and French warships to Bayonne. According to sources in London, the Basque authorities will arrange for the refugees to board the ships and will not be responsible for protecting the ships within the three-mile limit. Outside the three-mile limit, British warships will escort the ships to French ports. It is reported that the Nationalist leader Franco does not want to hinder the departure of refugees and has never interfered with ships leaving Spanish ports. The British Consul in Bilbao has informed the Basque authorities that Britain will protect any ship, regardless of nationality, that departs from Bilbao carrying non-combatants. This method of escorting refugees is fully in line with Britain's policy of non-intervention. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 1st)

### German Foreign Minister Visits Rome

[Rome] German Foreign Minister Neurath is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow to meet with Foreign Minister Ciano for talks. According to responsible sources, the German and Italian diplomatic authorities will discuss the situation in Central Europe and the relations between Germany, Italy, Britain, and France. Regarding the situation in Spain, German Aviation Minister General Göring has already had contact with Prime Minister Mussolini. This time, Neurath and Ciano will only supplement the discussions. In summary, the frequent contacts between German and Italian leaders demonstrate the solidity of the political axis between Germany and Italy, but no new agreements are planned at this time.

[Paris] L'Intransigeant newspaper recently reported that the French government lodged a strong protest with the Romanian government regarding the agreement between Italy and Romania, and the Romanian government has abandoned the agreement.

### London Streetcar Strike

Streetcars are Crowded, Pedestrians Complain Bitterly

[London] The mediation of the dispute in the London bus industry has failed. The drivers went on strike last night, and all buses stopped running after 11 p.m. This is the result of the drivers' demand for a seven-and-a-half-hour workday being rejected. The London Transport Board has 5,000 buses operating on 200 routes, carrying as many as 5.75 million passengers daily. The inconvenience to the public caused by today's stoppage is conceivable. With the coronation ceremony of the British monarch about to take place, and spectators gradually gathering in London, the inconvenience of transportation is particularly distressing. However, buses from London to the surrounding countryside are temporarily operating as usual. Before the strike took effect, Labour Minister Brown asked Transport Workers Union Chairman Bevin whether the strike could be postponed. Bevin replied that it could not, but special convenience could be given for emergency events such as sending patients to hospitals. He hopes to organize a private motorcade to handle it. There are 25,000 strikers. After the buses return to the factory, the workers will wash and wrap them as usual, as if they have been stored for a long time. After midnight, the strikers gathered in a coffee shop near the factory for a meeting, and the order was very good. Police patrolled outside the depot, but there were no riots.

Police had to maintain order at every streetcar stop, and underground trains were also crowded. Many people fainted from the heat and being squeezed.

### British Miners Also Brewing a General Strike

[London] The Miners' Federation held a national representative conference last night and decided to implement a national miners' strike on May 22. The purpose of this move is to force employers to recognize the Nottinghamshire Miners' Union and the right of miners in places like Harworth to join the union. Employers at the Harworth Colliery recently refused to negotiate with local unions that have joined the Miners' Federation. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 1st)

The 170 million people of the Soviet Union, regardless of their regions, work together with one heart and one mind to engage in the construction led by the Communist Party. All difficulties are eliminated and succeeded. Everyone is an architect of the socialist social institution." Speaking of the current international situation, he said, "Fascism is the enemy of workers and peasants. Its cruelty and violence are unparalleled. A brilliant world will become a cruel Shura field. Why is it not fascism that is the cause of it? Only the Red Army can prevent fascism, and it is not allowed to trample. If our country makes the world a slaughterhouse again, those who want to destroy all mankind and carry out aggressive actions often say that the Red Army is preparing to invade. This is completely wrong. It is important to know that the Red Army is not established to invade other countries, but to thoroughly eradicate the aggressor countries.

### Germany Celebrates National Day

Hitler's Speech Urges National Unity

[Berlin] German leader Hitler today, in celebration of the National Day, reviewed a parade of one million workers and government officials on a five-mile-long avenue in the city, and then delivered a speech to workers across the country via radio. He began by discussing Germany's economic problems, declaring that Germany is restricted by nature, and the land it occupies is not enough to supply its own survival. Therefore, German labor must make up for this natural deficiency with its own capabilities. In other words, it is necessary to unite into a solid society to jointly plan the issue of people's livelihood. He continued, but all plans, such as the Four-Year Plan, will be difficult to succeed if the public does not trust and support the designers. If they can give trust and support, then wages, market prices, and currency circulation will be very easy to increase. At the same time, he also advocated increasing the standard of living by increasing production. Although this work is difficult, the principle is very glorious. He continued that the socialist system and democratic restrictions are all based on the same principle of "survival of the fittest," and rewards are calculated based on ability and achievement. He himself was not a general, but an ordinary soldier. At the same time, several farmers from a few years ago are now provincial governors. Finally, Hitler declared that only a united country can fulfill its mission. Therefore, there is no so-called stage confrontation in the country, and all are working towards the same goal. He believes that those who are generally skeptical or attacking National Socialism will certainly be able to express their trust in the future. (National News Agency Hai Tong Electric on the 1st)

Celebration Situation at the Embassy in China

[Nanjing] German expatriates in Beijing held a celebration today to commemorate German National Day and the symbol of the National Socialist Party in power. Dr. Todtmann, the German Ambassador to China, delivered the opening speech, and at 11:00 am, he hosted a reception for the diplomatic corps, ministers of the National Government, and first-class figures from the administrative and educational circles of the capital. Among those who attended were the British, American, and Russian ambassadors and diplomatic representatives from other countries, important party and government figures, presidents of the Central and Jinling Universities, and other leading figures. At 4:00 pm, the German Embassy held another celebration. In his speech, Todtmann solemnly stated the process of the creation of the new Germany and discussed the situation of mass revolutionary movements in various countries in the 19th century, which evolved into the terrorism of anarchism during the European War. In opposition to this, there was the advocacy of a centralized system. This kind of advocacy was first put into practice by Hitler, so Hitler was the first European politician to combine the socialist views and the principles of the centralized government system into one. This success has added a different color to human society. Todtmann continued that he is convinced that the current democratic political system will gradually evolve and accept the ideas of the National Socialist revolution. Finally, Todtmann spoke freely about the general misconceptions about National Socialism, saying that National Socialism does not divide the world into two opposing camps of so-called "democracy" and "dictatorship."

### Draft Constitution of the Irish Free State Published

Restoring the Two-House System, Changing the Country's Name to "Éire"

⊙Dublin - The draft constitution of the Irish Free State was published here today. It stipulates that the future name of the Free State will be "Éire," which is a completely independent country.

(National News on the 1st)

[London] According to the new constitution, Ireland will sever the final connection with Britain in the future and lay the foundation for an independent republic. There are two notable points in the new constitution: first, Ireland will no longer support the King of England as the King, and it will not be necessary to consult the King's will to independently move and choose its political system and independently decide its external status; second, the Irish national territory should include all of Northern Ireland. British figures believe that this provision must be accepted by Northern Ireland, i.e., the Province of Ulster, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain (Northern Ireland and England, Scotland, and Wales are part of the United Kingdom). It is impossible at present (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 1st)

### Xiamen Rice Merchants Strike Entirely

Disputes Arise from the Revision of New Regulations by the Electric Company - Rice Merchants Petition the City Government to Charge Fees According to Old Regulations

Xiamen Correspondence: Due to a dispute over electricity prices between rice merchants and rice milling businesses and the electric company in Xiamen, resulting in cut-off wires and power outages, all rice merchants in the city went on strike on the 30th. The Xiamen Electric Power Company submitted last winter to the Central Construction Committee for approval to revise its business regulations, which were implemented on March 1 of this year. Under the old regulations, regardless of the number of lamps or the size of the meter, the base usage was uniformly five degrees per month, with electricity priced at 24 cents per degree. Under the new regulations, the electricity price has not increased, but the minimum base usage for a 3-ampere meter is six degrees per month, and the size of the meter is determined by the number of lamps, with a base usage of two degrees per ampere. The same principle applies to other sizes. Under the old regulations, regardless of the horsepower of the electric motor or the amount of electricity used, the price was uniformly five cents per degree, with a base usage of 25 degrees per month per horsepower. However, in practice, the usage was calculated based on actual consumption without any base usage restrictions. The new regulations stipulate a base usage of 15 degrees per month per horsepower, which is strictly enforced. The electricity price is divided into four tiers: 9 cents per degree for the first 50 degrees used per horsepower per month, 7.5 cents per degree for the next 100 degrees used (50 to 150 degrees), 6 cents per degree for the next 150 degrees used (150 to 300 degrees), and 5 cents per degree for usage exceeding 300 degrees. The electricity price for motors exceeding 50 horsepower can be negotiated separately. After the new regulations were announced, electricity users protested en masse. The Xiamen Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the city government to forward to the provincial government and the Central Construction Committee requesting correction. On April 10, the provincial government approved the charging of fees according to the new regulations. On April 15, the Construction Committee approved that the so-called correction should not be discussed, and ordered the city government to issue a notice requiring users to pay according to the new regulations. In this city, rice milling businesses are the majority of electricity users. They refused to pay according to the new regulations and sent a letter to the company proposing to negotiate a solution. The company stated that it could not be changed because it had been approved by the Construction Committee. On April 20, it sent a letter to the rice milling businesses, giving them a week to pay the electricity bill for March, otherwise the electricity would be cut off. On April 27, the electricity was first cut off to the Changyiyuan and Xinsheng rice mills. The rice milling businesses' negotiations were unsuccessful. On April 29, all rice milling factories in the city went on strike and stopped buying and selling. The Xianghu Rice Company, which is a major purchaser of rice from Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Wuhu and sells it to rice milling businesses, who then refine it and wholesale it to rice shops, has had its supply cut off due to the strike of the rice milling businesses. On the 30th, over 200 rice shops in the city also went on strike, posting signs in front of their doors stating "The electric company is relying on its power and acting unreasonably, cutting off electricity. This shop has little rice in stock and is temporarily closed for petitioning." At 11:00 a.m., over 300 representatives of the rice industry in the city, carrying banners that read "The Xiamen Rice Industry Association is protesting the unreasonable price increase by the electric company," went to the city government to petition, demanding that the company temporarily charge electricity fees according to the old regulations and immediately reconnect the electricity. Mayor Li Shilin replied that the new electricity fee regulations had been approved by the competent authorities and that the city government was not in a position to sanction them. He said that the rice merchants' strike was related to the people's food supply and was a major issue, and that they should resume business as usual to prevent the turmoil from spreading. He stated that the city government would convene the electric company and rice milling businesses to mediate. In the afternoon, the Bureau of Public Works notified Zhang Zhensheng, the managing director of the company, to come to the city government for consultation, but Zhang declined due to other matters, and the mediation could not proceed. At 8:00 p.m., the Rice Industry Association held an emergency meeting and decided: (1) to continue the strike today and petition the Chamber of Commerce for assistance, and (2) to order the rice mills that had their electricity cut off to restore power. The Chamber of Commerce immediately sent a telegram to the Construction Committee, the provincial government, and the Construction Department, stating that the Xiamen Municipal Government should be ordered to order the company to restore power to the rice mills that had their electricity cut off in order to prioritize the people's food supply, and that the electricity prices and base usage could be discussed at length. It also sent a letter to the electric company stating that the case was being followed in accordance with the Construction Committee's approved order. Both sides have taken extreme positions. The Xiamen Chamber of Commerce, based on the petition of all electricity users in the city, decided at a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees on the 29th that the Construction Committee's instructions on the case of the electric company's change of business regulations were ambiguous and that the Chamber of Commerce would protest on the basis of reason and would appeal to the Executive Yuan. (May 1)

### Full Text of the Verdict on the Assassination of Wang Jingwei and Song Ziwen (Continued)

Furthermore, Wang Renshan provided extremely detailed descriptions of the residences of the defendants and Wang Yaqiao, and stated that No. 10 Yongxing Street was initially inhabited by Wang Yaqiao, and later moved to by the defendant Yu Likui. It can be seen that Wang Renshan's claims of frequent meetings with the defendants and knowledge of their affairs are not fabrications. As for his description of the organization of the Chenguang News Agency and the individuals holding positions within it, it is in complete agreement with the testimony of Li Zhi, the Deputy Director of the Supervisory Department of the Capital Police Department, in the Hong Kong court. Moreover, the lease agreement between Chenguang News Agency and its landlord, as well as the registration forms submitted to the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau and the Special Municipality Party Department, were all nominally the responsibility of Hua Kezhi, using the alias Hu Yunqing. The defendant He Poguang was also listed as a guarantor and editor on the same agreement. This has also been verified by Li Zhi to be true. Therefore, Wang Renshan's testimony is sufficiently credible and not without reasonable basis.

If it is argued that Wang Renshan's testimony regarding the defendants Yu Lichan, Zhou Shiping, Hu Dahai, Zhang Yuhua, etc., meeting with Wang Yaqiao in Hong Kong is entirely false, such as the instruction given by Sun Fengming of the Qiongya Chamber of Commerce in March of the 24th year of the Republic (1935) and the reports given by Hua Kezhi at Yu Likui's residence on Chenghe Road on November 7th and 8th of the same year.  Since the testimony of Wang Renshan's father, Gong Xiangquan, and Ma Tang, a waiter at the Guangzhou Dongya Hotel in Hong Kong, is sufficient to prove that his words are not true, it is impossible to adopt them as credible evidence. However, Wang Renshan made a slight error in the date of the report from Hua Kezhi, which occurred on November 7th and 8th. This alone cannot serve as strong evidence to overturn his entire testimony. It has been verified that the defendant Yu Likui traveled to Guangzhou on November 7th of the 24th year of the Republic (1935) and resided in room 604 on the sixth floor of the Dongya Hotel, arriving at the hotel at 7:00 AM on the 7th and departing at 4:00 PM on the 11th, as evidenced by the testimony of witness Ma Tang and the submitted bills and registers. However, Wang Renshan stated in this court, "I saw Yu Likui, that's correct, but I may have misremembered the date. Now I recall that Hua Kezhi went to Hong Kong a few days before the 7th or 8th," which does not mean that the entire event is false. Therefore, after repeated questioning, he did not change his statement, so the veracity of that statement is not difficult to determine. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that Wang Renshan's testimony in this section is completely wrong, it can only prove that the defendants did not take any action after the assassination of President Wang, and cannot be used to presume that everything he said before is untrue. Wang Renshan's testimony can still be admitted as evidence.

As for his claim regarding Sun Fengming of the Qiongya Chamber of Commerce, according to Wang Biquan's testimony, "During the New Year of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), I was in Guangzhou until the 20th day of the first month (referring to the lunar calendar) when I returned to Hong Kong. From that time until the end of February, I was always in the Chamber of Commerce and rarely went out. I usually spent my time in the Chamber and did not go out after dinner at 5 o'clock. I don't remember my son (referring to Wang Renshan) meeting with Wang Yaqiao and the fugitive criminals (referring to the defendants Yu Likui, Zhang Yuhua, etc.) in the Chamber of Commerce. My son's testimony is not accurate," etc. However, when questioned by Wang Renshan, he claimed, "The Chamber of Commerce is not his (referring to Wang Biquan) personal property. He is afraid of questions from the merchants, so he denies it. In reality, the meeting was held in the Qiongya Chamber of Commerce," etc. It can be seen that the meeting between Yu Likui, Zhang Yuhua, etc., and Wang Yaqiao at the Qiongya Chamber of Commerce was not imaginary. It is merely that Wang Biquan wanted to preserve the reputation of the Chamber of Commerce and had to make such a statement. Moreover, in March of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the defendant Zhang Yuhua did bring Sun Fengming and Guo Huizhong to Hong Kong to meet with Hua Kezhi and go to the fourth floor of the Qiongya Chamber of Commerce to see Wang Yaqiao. Furthermore, Zhang Yuhua and Guo Huizhong have confessed one after another that this was not without precedent, which is undoubtedly clear. (To be continued)

### Suzhou

Exhumation for Autopsy in a Homicide Case

Yan Xu's daughter, Da Nan (also known as Yan Yang), from Huguan Township, was 22 years old. Four years ago, she married Yang Ronggen, a fellow villager, through a matchmaker. She had already given birth to a son, who was three years old. Unexpectedly, on the 19th of last month, Yan Yang suddenly died violently and was hastily coffined. Her mother, Yan Xu, learned that her daughter had bled from the corners of her mouth and that her face and other parts of her body were bruised after her death. It was rumored that she had been abused to death by her husband and mother-in-law. She specifically came to the city the other day to report to the District Procuratorate, requesting an exhumation for an autopsy to seek justice for the deceased. On the 1st, the District Procuratorate sent personnel to the village to exhume the body for an autopsy. As a result, it was confirmed that she had died from injuries sustained before her death. Her husband, Yang Ronggen, and others were brought to the court for questioning.

Shop Assistant Commits Suicide After Being Dismissed

Tong Rongyuan, a 28-year-old native of Zhenjiang, lived at No. 56 Xueshi Street in the city. He used to work as a shop assistant at the Dahua Hat Shop in the West Central Market, earning a monthly salary of nine yuan. On March 11th of this year, he was dismissed by Zhu Yaoquan, the assistant manager of the shop, because Tong liked to gamble and had repeatedly refused to listen to warnings. After being stimulated by this, Tong took a bottle of wine, cigarettes, and dried mustard greens to the top of the North Temple Pagoda at 11:00 AM today (the 2nd) and jumped to his death after a frenzy of drinking. He immediately suffered a fractured skull and legs. He was sent to the hospital for treatment, but it was too late, and he died. According to what he said before his death, he was forced to do this because of the oppression of the assistant manager. There were also three pairs of suicide notes addressed to his family and relatives, with similar content.

Investigation of Malfeasance and Extortion in Tax Collection

Wang Junshi, a cadre of the Seventh District Farmers' Association, stated that land tax is a national tax and a major source of revenue for the treasury. Its source comes directly from landowners and indirectly from tenant farmers or self-cultivating farmers. The malfeasance and extortion of general tax collectors and village heads are extremely illegal. He filed a petition with the County Farmers' Association, which was forwarded to the County Government, requesting a strict investigation and prohibition. After receiving the petition, County Magistrate Long issued a public notice yesterday (2nd) strictly prohibiting such activities. Afterwards, village heads and tax collectors in various districts must not engage in the aforementioned malfeasance and extortion when collecting land taxes. If they deliberately violate this order, once discovered or reported, they will be severely punished and not tolerated.

The Enthusiasm for Holding Incense Parades

Chairman's Report

Chairman Zhou Xuexiang reported: "Representatives, comrades, today is the International Labor Day, already the 51st anniversary. Many representatives and comrades have come to participate in the meeting, and I am very excited. I think you all must have the same excitement. Today, I would like to briefly report on the significance of the commemorative meeting. On October 7, 1884, an international and national labor conference was convened in Chicago, USA. Many proposals were discussed. Among them, the most important labor issue was the slogan of the 'three eights system,' demanding that the government implement it, and it was decided to hold a demonstration on May 1, 1886. They prepared sufficient forces and united the labor front. On May 1, 1886, this grand demonstration was indeed held. The so-called three eights system—eight hours of work, eight hours of education, and eight hours of rest—was resolutely requested from the government at the same time. However, the government and the capitalists of the United States at that time not only refused to allow it, but also suppressed the workers and destroyed the labor movement. Unfortunately, many workers were sacrificed, creating a bloody tragedy. As for the workers' side, although they went through sacrifice and bloodshed, they continued to struggle without losing heart, hoping to achieve victory. Every year on May 1st, they continued to hold demonstrations. This movement later influenced various European countries, which also held labor demonstrations on May 1st, similarly demanding the implementation of the three eights system. After many sacrifices and bloodshed, this International Labor Day finally received the sympathy of the governments of European and American countries, which recognized the three eights system and allowed May 1st each year as a commemorative day for labor, with the provision of a day off with pay. This commemoration can be said to be a victory obtained after many difficulties and sacrifices, through continuous and resolute requests to the government. Since obtaining this victory, they have worked very hard, their technology has gradually improved, and production has increased every year. On the one hand, they have also strived to study, improve labor knowledge, increase labor status, and seek labor liberation. These are all the results of efforts after May 1st. It is not only worthy of commemoration by the workers of Europe and America, but also worthy of commemoration by the workers of the whole world. However, the occurrence of a commemoration must have its historical background and its significance for the times. Why did May 1st not occur in Asia, Europe, and other places, but in the United States, influencing Europe? At that time, the industries of European and American countries were very developed, and the power of capitalists was very strong. They controlled all the power of production and distribution and treated workers very harshly. Especially in the United States, which was a newly emerging industrial country, a great economic panic occurred, and the number of unemployed workers increased. The suffering of workers was more serious than that of European workers. The living environment of workers became increasingly harsh. This is why the May 1st Labor Day demonstration inevitably broke out in the United States. When we think back to this great movement experienced by workers in European and American countries, we feel that the labor problem in China is more serious than that of workers in European and American countries. Social and economic panic, rural bankruptcy, and the economic power of capitalist imperialists have manipulated China's finance and established large-scale factories in China. Because tariffs cannot be self-reliant, foreign goods are dumped into China, a country with backward production, as much as possible. What we feel most painful is the problem of smuggling. Under these circumstances, how can China's industry develop? Industry is the fundamental problem of China. Without industrial development, it is impossible to solve the suffering of workers and to relieve labor unemployment. Now, our workers not only cannot achieve the eight-hour work system, but also have no work to do even if they demand twelve hours of work. This is because our industry has been monopolized by capitalist imperialists. Our factories cannot develop soundly, and the lack of industrial development directly and indirectly affects the workers. Therefore, to solve China's labor problem, we have no choice but to 'rely on our own efforts.' The meaning of self-reliance is to rely on our own strength to develop China's industry and liberate the suffering of workers. The first step in self-reliance is to achieve labor-capital coordination. Both capital and labor must have great awareness and be able to understand each other. Not only must we consider the suffering of the workers, but also the entire industrial problem of China. The second step is to work hard according to the National Economic Construction Movement instructed by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to revive China's economy. Our workers should take responsibility according to these two steps, share the same boat with the capital, and concentrate the power of the government and the people to save China's industry and jointly support the development of Chinese industry to liberate the suffering of workers. Therefore, we are holding a commemorative meeting here today, and everyone must unite, eliminate class struggle under the leadership of national salvation and consolidate the national front, complete national construction, and revive the Chinese nation. Finally, I wish everyone joint efforts."

Lu's Admonition

"Everyone, today is the 'May 1st' Labor Day. I am very honored to have been sent by the City Party Department to attend the commemorative meeting held by the General Labor Union. The chairman has already explained the historical facts of 'May 1st.' This kind of valuable and meaningful historical action of workers using their own power to strive for liberation should be solemnly commemorated and deeply understood by our labor community. Before 'May 1st,' the life of workers was like that of cattle and horses, very painful. Their labor was completely exploited by the capitalists. The workers could not bear it anymore, so they took this kind of heroic action. After many struggles, they were able to achieve the three eights system, the goal of eight hours of work, eight hours of education, and eight hours of rest. This kind of success is purely based on the workers themselves being trained and organized. At present, the mode of production is more advanced than in the 19th century. Some industrially advanced countries have implemented a six-hour work system. Although working hours have been reduced, production has greatly increased compared to before. Looking back at Chinese workers, they generally work twelve hours, and the suffering of their lives and the poor treatment they receive is worse than in any other country. Some people say that Chinese workers can emulate the martyrs of 'May 1st' to strive for welfare. This is ignorant of the Chinese environment. There are no capitalists in China now, and the suffering of Chinese workers is not oppressed by capitalists, but by the political and economic oppression of the powers. China's labor problem is a part of the entire country and cannot be solved alone. Therefore, upholding the interests of the country should be the major premise, and personal interests should not be the only consideration. Otherwise, it will not only harm oneself, but also harm the nation and the country. The Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee this year declared that the government has given pertinent instructions on this, and has spoken in detail about eradicating class struggle and protecting national industry. I think everyone has a deep understanding. I personally think that Chinese workers should follow the instructions of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, 'One person does the work of two people, and two people eat the food of one person,' to make production developed and the economy prosperous. If so, the national strength will be enriched, the country will be strong, foreign aggression can be relaxed, and life can be peaceful. At the same time, I hope that everyone will convey this kind of intention to the workers throughout the city, so that they can understand and obey the government and the intentions of our party."

### Railway Engineering Exhibition Opens Yesterday

The Railway Engineering Exhibition, jointly organized by the Nanjing Engineering Reference Library and the Shanghai Municipal Museum, opened yesterday. The day before, Mr. Yuan Tongli, the director of the Engineering Reference Library, and Mr. Hu Zhaochun, the director of the Municipal Museum, hosted guests from all walks of life, including Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Railways (represented by Director Xie Fencheng), the Mayor of Shanghai (represented by Councilor Lin Zifeng), Director Huang Boqiao of the Two-Roads Administration, and hundreds of Chinese and foreign guests. It was originally planned that Mr. Ye Gongchuo, the former Minister of Railways, would preside, but he was unable to attend due to illness. Director Hu acted as chairman in his place. First, Mr. Hu reported on the significance of the museum's continuous special exhibitions, stating that the museum has already held exhibitions on museums from around the world, ancient jade and porcelain exhibitions, and exhibitions on the customs of the Li and Miao peoples of Hainan Island. This is the fourth exhibition, and it is the most grand and meaningful, and it should be beneficial to the country's construction projects. The fifth special exhibition is planned to be an exhibition on freshwater organisms, and the sixth may be an exhibition on Shanghai opera. Next, Councilor Lin gave a speech on behalf of the Mayor, elaborating on the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings on railway construction and hoping that people from all walks of life could use this exhibition to help realize the late Premier's teachings. Next, Director Xie of the Ministry of Railways reported on the central government's five-year railway construction plan, which plans to build more than 80 kilometers of railways within five years to complete the southwest and southeast transportation lines, which are essential for industry and national defense. Next, Director Huang of the Two-Roads Administration gave a speech, explaining the significance of the railway engineering exhibition in great detail, stating that he had previously been ordered by the central government to spend half a year and tens of thousands of dollars to investigate railway construction in Europe, and he had gained a lot of knowledge. However, one person's knowledge is limited. This time, the directors of the Engineering Reference Library and the Municipal Museum collected so much material for public viewing, which is more than going abroad to investigate. Director Xie just reported on the central government's five-year railway construction plan, which can now be used to arouse public sympathy through this exhibition. Railway construction in our country can be said to be 50 years behind Europe and the United States. Now that the central government has a plan to build more than 8,000 kilometers of railways, what it wants to build is the most modern. This exhibition has collected the latest European and American railway engineering, which is of great significance. We really admire it. Afterwards, Director Yuan gave a speech, stating that general libraries often only pay attention to books and not to pictures. The trend of modern education has shifted from school education to automatic education, so pictures are very important, which is even more needed in engineering libraries. However, looking at pictures is not as good as looking at real objects, and looking at real objects requires museums. Schools, libraries, and museums are actually three in one. The Nanjing Engineering Reference Library has held special exhibitions on aviation, radio, and scientific instruments. This is also the fourth time. Now that we have received enthusiastic support from all walks of life and heard about the central government's five-year railway plan, we are very fortunate. Since the central government has a plan, academic institutions can provide as much material as possible. The central government's plan and academic institutions can actually work together. Yesterday was Sunday, the weather was sunny and warm, and people from all walks of life went to visit, especially engineering students from various universities. For the sake of popularization, the museum only charged five cents for admission.

It is also heard that at 10:00 am one day, Dr. Monroe, accompanied by Mr. Ren Hongjun, the president of Sichuan University, visited the museum in the rain. Mr. Hu Zhaochun and Mr. Chen Duanzhi of the museum received them and discussed educational and museum operational issues in detail. Mr. Monroe and Mr. Ren expressed their satisfaction with the museum. After 12:00 pm, they left the museum and went to the Zhongshan Hospital and the Science Society for banquets.

### Ye Chucang and Shao Lizi Hosted a Banquet for Leaders from All Walks of Life Yesterday Afternoon

To Prepare for the Celebration of Mr. Du Yuesheng's 50th Birthday, the Funds for the Celebration Will Be Used to Build a Science Museum at Fudan University

Mr. Du Yuesheng, a leader in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles and the president of the local association, is usually enthusiastic about public welfare and is highly respected by local people. Mr. Du has been a member of the board of directors of Fudan University for many years and has provided a great deal of support for the development of the university. This year, August marks Mr. Du's 50th birthday, and it also coincides with the university's plan to expand its campus and build new school buildings on the shores of Taihu Lake in Wuxi. Therefore, the university's board of directors decided to initiate preparations for the celebration and suggest to Mr. Du that the funds for the celebration be used to build a Yuesheng Science Museum on the new campus to leave a lasting memory of Mr. Du. The construction cost is estimated to be more than 100,000 yuan. Yesterday at noon, Mr. Ye Chucang and Mr. Shao Lizi, both members of the university's board of directors, came to Shanghai from Beijing specifically for this matter to invite leaders from all walks of life and Mr. Du's relatives and friends to a banquet at the International Hotel to discuss the preparations for Mr. Du's birthday. Those who attended included Sun Ke, Li Shizeng, Yu Hongjun, Yu Qiaqing, Zhou Zuomin, Song Hanzhang, Ye Yuhu, Hu Bijang, Xu Xinliu, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Fu Xiaoan, Wen Lanting, Wu Yunzhai, Hu Xiyuan, Pan Gongbi, Wang Boqi, Niao Yinliang, Yan Duhe, Guan Ji'an, Zhao Qunhao, Wu Kaixian, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Peihuang, Cai Jinjun, Shen Qia, Li Ting'an, Zhou Yongneng, Ji Zhangjian, Ye Zhuotang, Wang Yiting, Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Zuoting, Ye Fuxiao, Qin Runqing, Chen Xing, Jin Zongcheng, Guo Shun, Liu Zhilu, Zhang Shouyong, Zhao Jinqing, Li Denghui, Zhu Shaoping, Guo Zhongliang, Tang Shichang, Zhang Shichuan, Liu Zhanen, Jiang Yiping, Xu Xiaochu, Xi Yushu, Zhou Yueran, Zhuang Ruiwu, Cai Futang, Mao Heyuan, Wu Yingsun, Shao Zuolong, Pu Xianyuan, Zhang Kechang, Gu Xinyi, Xu Jiqing, Tang Youwei, Ye Jichun, Chen Dazai, Fu Ruiquan, Lu Yuequan, Jing Qiankun, Lu Jingshi, Shen Zhenhua, Mao Zhixiang, Gui Baoquan, Luo Qinghua, Wang Yansong, Zhang Fayao, Zhang Weiru, Pang Jingzhou, Zhu Douwen, Fu Pinggui, Yao Yinpeng, Xu Yefu, Chen Jicheng, Wu Jiangfeng, E Sen, Mao Yun, Wu Nanxuan, Zhang Yousan, Yin Yiwen, Jin Tongyin, etc. First, Mr. Ye Chucang delivered a speech, stating that he and Mr. Shao Lizi were representing the board of directors of Fudan University to invite everyone to this banquet. Fudan University's success today is due to the support of revolutionary pioneers and leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai, especially Mr. Du, a member of the board of directors, who has contributed the most. This year marks Mr. Du's 50th birthday, and it also coincides with the university's acquisition of more than 1,000 acres of land in Wuxi with the support of Mr. Wu Zhihui and Mr. Niu Tiesheng, members of the Central Committee, where new school buildings are planned to be built. Therefore, we are initiating the construction of the Yuesheng Science Museum to commemorate him forever. We hope that leaders from all walks of life will support this. If there are surplus funds beyond the construction of the Yuesheng Science Museum, we will seek Mr. Du's consent to subsidize other social and cultural undertakings. Next, Mr. Shao Lizi gave a speech, stating that last year, people from all walks of life across the country donated planes to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for his birthday, which benefited the country greatly and set a model for birthday celebrations. This year is Mr. Du's birthday, and using the funds for the celebration to promote education saves resources and promotes public welfare, which is similar to donating planes for a birthday celebration. He hoped that leaders from all walks of life would work together to make this event a success. Next, Mr. Sun Ke, the president of the Legislative Yuan and a member of the university's board of directors, gave a speech, stating that Mr. Du is enthusiastic about social undertakings and has made outstanding achievements. Our university has a history of several decades and is renowned both domestically and internationally. Now, using the funds for the celebration to build the Yuesheng Science Museum to last for a long time is truly a win-win situation. We hope that all sectors of society will support this. Then, Mr. Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, gave a speech, stating that Mr. Du has strongly supported Fudan University. Recently, Mr. Wu Zhihui has also been very enthusiastic in helping Fudan University raise funds for 1,000 acres of land in Wuxi. Mr. Wu has long had the idea of developing the Taihu Lake area, and Mr. Du's construction of the Science Museum on the shores of Taihu Lake fits this idea well. Next year is Mr. Wu's 70th birthday, and we hope that we can celebrate his birthday in the same way, which will make the lake and mountains even more beautiful. Then, Acting Mayor Yu Hongjun gave a speech, stating that Mr. Du is a leader who is enthusiastic about public welfare, and Fudan University is a well-known institution of higher learning in Southeast China. I, on behalf of the municipal government, will do my best to support the school's plan to celebrate Mr. Du's birthday. I also hope that everyone present today will be initiators. Then, Mr. Yu Qiaqing gave a speech, stating that he felt very happy to attend this grand banquet. He especially agreed that commemorating celebrities at a well-known university. Then, Mr. Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, stating that he fully supports the idea of celebrating Mr. Du's birthday by building the Fudan Science Museum. He also hoped that the funds for the celebration would be used in a concentrated manner so that the Fudan Science Museum could become a permanent memorial with a grand scale. Finally, Mr. Qian Xinzhi, the acting president of Fudan University, gave a thank-you speech and announced the list of initiators and organizers for Mr. Du's birthday celebration. The guests and hosts parted happily.

### The Jiangnan Shipyard Trade Union Celebrated Its Tenth Anniversary

The Ninth Executive and Supervisory Committee Takes Office

The Jiangnan Shipyard Trade Union of the Navy Department held its tenth anniversary celebration at Bansong Garden at 9:00 am on the first of this month. The ninth executive and supervisory committee also took office at the same time. Representatives from all sectors of the party, government, and military in the city attended. The details of the afternoon's entertainment conference are as follows:

Declaration of Commemoration

This association was established on May 1, 1927, and has now been around for ten years. In this process, this association has been under the leadership of the party department of this shipyard and the supervision of the instructor. For the past ten years, we have been of one heart and mind, working together in harmony. This is due to the dedication of the executive and supervisory members in the past, but also to the collective efforts of all comrades. The past directors and deputy directors have all adhered to Premier Sun Yat-sen's principle of caring for workers, and have gradually undertaken all undertakings that are beneficial to workers. The most prominent of these are the expansion of the workers' children's school, the cultivation of young talents, and after graduation, those who are unable to learn are allowed to enter the factory to study. In addition, the apprentices' training institute was established, and applied science was taught in the apprentices' night school to achieve the effect of both work and study. In view of the fact that the workers of this shipyard have served for many years and have considerable achievements, special retirement support regulations have been promulgated to stabilize the lives of elderly workers, and a savings subsidy system has been established to cultivate the habit of thrift. This is indeed the reason why more than a thousand workers in our shipyard are grateful and cannot help but express their feelings. However, in recent years, the national crisis has been pressing, and naval construction is urgent. All of our comrades must devote themselves to the research of craftsmanship, and each one should use their own ideas to refine and ponder, remove the unnecessary and retain the essence, and take the good and make up for the shortcomings, so as to jointly seek the advancement of art and jointly plan the development of this shipyard. We look forward to the day when the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy will become a model factory in the country, so as not to fail the government's predetermined great national defense plan, which is what we all earnestly pray for. Now that we are celebrating the tenth anniversary of the establishment of this association, we would like to share some brief thoughts for encouragement. We hope that the heads of various agencies and comrades who care for this association will give us guidance at any time.

Inauguration of the Executive and Supervisory Committee

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Establishes a Committee to Adjust Seafarer Services

In order to adjust the services of seafarers, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has specially organized a committee to adjust the services of seafarers, and appointed Deputy Manager Shen Zhongyi as chairman. The committee members are the directors of various departments: Zhang Dingzhi, Wang Xiangchen, Zeng Guangqing, Chen Shaoji, and senior officers of various ships: Teng Shibiao, Chen Jinyu, Huang Hongqian, Ye Jintai, Zhou Hong, Yin, Fang Gencai, Yu Shunbin, Chen Guoxiong, Qian Xiangshan, Xin Lifu, Chen Tingxun, and Yan Yi. Their task is to investigate the qualifications of the crew members of various ships, obtain detailed records, and conduct assessments based on the records. According to the results of the assessment, reasonable promotions will be made, and various regulations regarding the services of the staff will be revised. The bureau has ordered the committee to be established within a time limit, and all crew members are informed that they can contribute their opinions to the committee as much as possible.

### Import Surtax on Foreign Rice Cannot Be Waived

Reply from the Ministry of Finance to the Guangdong Provincial Government

According to Xin Xin News Agency, the Ministry of Finance replied to the Guangdong Provincial Government's request to waive the dredged river surtax on imported foreign rice and grain during the semi-tax credit period, stating that goods that are exempt from tax or on credit are not exempt from surtax. The reason is that the surtax is mostly collected for special funds to be used for dredging rivers and repairing dikes. The tax rate is light, and if all tax-exempt or credit goods are exempted from the surtax, it will directly affect the collection of surtax and indirectly affect the operation of business. Therefore, regardless of tax-exempt military supplies or other credit goods, the surtax is collected. Moreover, the dredged river surtax collected by the Guangdong Customs was originally requested by the Guangdong Provincial Government and submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry for approval to be implemented. The Ministry previously approved the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs and the Fourth Route Army Headquarters' request to exempt tax-exempt military supplies from this surtax, and has requested that they be taxed separately. Therefore, it is not appropriate to create a precedent for tax exemption for foreign rice and grain that are allowed tax exemption and credit in Guangdong, which is inconsistent with the original intention of the Guangdong Provincial Government to levy the surtax. This reply is for the Guangdong Provincial Government to check and follow.

### Fujian Associations Appeal for Rescue from the Plague in Southern Fujian

Various Fujian associations in Shanghai, in view of the prevalence of the plague and the large number of deaths in the southern part of the province, have initiated the organization of the Southern Fujian Plague Prevention and Rescue Committee, and recommended Xiao Bichuan and Wang Pingnan to go to Beijing to petition the central authorities to find ways to eradicate the plague as soon as possible. They sent a letter to all sectors of society in the city yesterday, requesting donations of plague injection medicine, rodenticides, and other medicines. The direct approach to eradicating the plague in southern Fujian has been around for more than 40 years. Of those infected, only a handful survive, and the number of deaths is close to seven million. The disasters of the world, such as floods, droughts, famines, wars, and bandits, are not as cruel as this. This spring, the plague is spreading even more, with deaths everywhere. Hundreds of millions of survivors are living in constant fear. The severity of the plague and the extent of its spread are unprecedented. If it is not eradicated quickly, we are afraid that we will all perish. Jin, Hui, Xing'an, Quan, and Zhang associations and other groups in Shanghai, in view of this, have initiated the organization of the Southern Fujian Plague Prevention and Rescue Committee, and invited various charitable organizations to participate in joint prevention and rescue. We hope that people from all walks of life will sympathize with the victims in the plague area, show compassion, and donate various medicines such as plague injection medicine, rodenticides, and disinfectants to the association at Tai Xin Li No. Xin Kai He Road, this city, so that they can be sent to the plague area for rescue. This is a great public service.

### Two Organizations Meet to Discuss Sichuan Disaster Relief

Heavy Rains in Sichuan Counties Bring Joy to the People

A certain entity here received a telegram on May 2nd from Cao Zhongzhi, an inspector from the Ministry of Finance, who departed from Guangyuan. The telegram stated that on the 29th, he departed from Chengdu to inspect the disaster in northern Sichuan, spending the night in Zitong. On the 30th, he arrived in Jiange and went to the countryside to inspect the disaster. Wheat and peas were withered and dry, and people were gathering wild vegetables and grass roots to eat. Seven or eight hundred disaster victims surrounded him, and he only dispersed them by giving each person one dime from his salary. That night, Zhaohua, Guangyuan, and Jiange experienced rainfall that did not stop all night, with a depth of about five or six inches, the heaviest rain in a year. On the morning of the 1st, he traveled from Jiange to Guangyuan via Zhaohua. Along the way, farmers were busily planting yellow and green beans and corn in the fields. The Jialing River had already risen, and it was predicted that the upstream areas would also receive beneficial rainfall.

Furthermore, a telegram received on May 1st from Guan Jiyu, a special envoy from Sichuan Province, stated that it began raining here at 4:00 PM on the 30th and had not stopped as of the time of the telegram. It was reported that counties along the road from Chengdu to Chongqing also received rain at the same time, bringing great joy to officials and civilians alike.

The Sichuan Disaster Relief Association held its third meeting at the Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association at 3:00 PM on the 1st. More than sixty people attended, including Mei Xinru, Xiao Quan, Chen Yuejiang, Li Qingfan, Lei Yuji, Yang Dequan, Tang Dean, Lu Feng, Cong Chongcun, Fan Jiaqu, Liu Bingyi, Zhang Shulin, Tai Zhoucun, Zuo Boming, Zheng Yushu, Pu Fengming, Tang Jinbai, Li Xunfu, and Gui Ronghua. Tang Dean chaired the meeting, and Yang Zehuan served as the recorder. First, the chairman reported on the representatives' trip to Beijing. On this occasion, Xiang Yuren, Li Qingfan, and Dean went to Beijing to report on the situation of the Shanghai Sichuan Disaster Relief Association. Together with the Nanjing Sichuan Disaster Relief Association, they agreed on the following: (1) Requesting the central government to issue disaster relief bonds, with the amount determined to be 20 million. (2) Since the disaster relief associations in Beijing and Shanghai both have offices, to facilitate mutual communication between the two offices, executive directors should be elected from the vice presidents of this association to ensure comprehensive coordination. They also visited President Dai Jitao to discuss that the issuance of bonds should use provincial funds as a foundation. The foundation designated by Liu Xiang was a national tax, which was legally inappropriate. It was also reported that the Executive Yuan and the financial authorities were very concerned about the unprecedented drought in Sichuan Province and expressed their support for issuing bonds for disaster relief. However, the foundation should be designated from provincial taxes as collateral. The Director of the Sichuan Provincial Finance Department, Liu Hangchen, has already negotiated with the central government on another method for the bond fund, so the issuance of bonds is no longer a problem. This association only urges its early realization for work relief. They expressed great support for the election of executive directors from the vice presidents of this association. Immediately, Xiang Yuren, Wu Daquan, Xu Keting, Zhang Yuejun, Lu Hanqun, and Zou Yulin were elected as executive directors. In case of important special matters, the executive directors will handle them. Regarding Shanghai, it is planned to thank various charitable organizations and the financial community after the date is determined, and all chairmen and vice-chairmen will attend. The following important matters were immediately resolved: (1) Chairman Zhu Qinglan telegraphed this association to remit 10,000 yuan to Chongqing to set up porridge kitchens. It was resolved to allocate the funds as requested, with 5,000 yuan each coming from the Da Gong Bao and Juxingcheng, which are collecting donations on behalf of this association, totaling 10,000 yuan, to be remitted to the designated commercial bank. The Da Gong Bao and Juxingcheng were instructed to take note. (2) A telegram from Wanxian requested relief for the fire disaster in that county. It was resolved to forward the original telegram to the Nanjing Relief Association and the Sichuan Provincial Relief Association for verification.

The Education and Culture Circle Fundraising Committee of the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association held its first fundraising meeting at the Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association at 2:00 PM on the 1st. More than thirty people attended, including Liu Jieao, Lu Jizeng, Wu Qi, Tang Jinbai, Xiao Yanbin, Chen Yuejiang, Guo Deying, Gui Yingfen, Tang Yuanyu, Liu Guozhang, Guo Jianshi, Zhang Peiqiong, Yu Congzhen, and Wang Zuozhou. Tang Jinbai chaired the meeting, and Gui Rongfen served as the recorder. First, the chairman reported on (1) the recent situation of the Sichuan disaster and the organization of the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association, as well as the methods for raising funds and providing relief; (2) each school's Sichuan fellow-provincial association should send one representative to attend the meetings of this circle; (3) Sichuan students in each school should immediately initiate disaster relief movements; (4) all expenses incurred in fundraising will be covered by their own donations; (5) the fundraising period starts from today and ends at the end of this month. The following important matters were discussed: (1) Creating a map of Sichuan Province divided by counties, to be posted in various cultural institutions, with markings indicating the severity of the disaster in each county to draw attention from all circles. (2) Broadcasting and lecturing on the actual situation of the disaster. (3) Writing to the Central Film Studio to produce newsreels of the Sichuan disaster. (4) Writing to the Shanghai Boy Scout Headquarters to request the city's boy scouts to collect donations for one day for the Sichuan disaster to provide relief to the disaster victims. (5) Telegramming the Sichuan Provincial Government again to maintain the original plan for study abroad expenses.

### Chamber of Commerce Explains Stamp Duty on Receiving Slips

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Transportation Industry Association yesterday, explaining the stamp duty on receiving slips, saying: "In reply to your letter of the 30th of this month, regarding whether stamp duty should be affixed to the receiving slips issued by your company's warehouse, with a sample attached for interpretation, etc., this chamber has investigated that these receiving slips are for goods entrusted to your company for transportation by customers. After the warehouse counts and receives the goods, it issues these slips to the customer's delivery person. This is entirely to prove the rights and obligations between the client and the entrusted party, and it is not an internal document as mentioned in your letter. Although it is claimed that these receiving slips can be exchanged for bills of lading and are marked with 'invalid after the next day,' according to the Ministry of Finance's document on April 23rd of last year for the China Express Company case, Tax No. 9305, to this chamber, which stated, 'Slips issued for receiving money or rented goods belong to the nature of receipts for money or rented goods. Slips issued by merchants entrusted to handle transportation of rented goods as proof of collection belong to the nature of bills of lading. The uses of the two are different and should be affixed with stamp duty separately.' Therefore, although these receiving slips can be used to exchange for formal bills of lading, they still cannot be regarded as substitutes for bills of lading and still retain their independent nature as receipts for goods. According to the Ministry's approval, this is very clear. The effectiveness of these receiving slips is very short, but cash-paid bills such as hotel and restaurant bills, etc., also have very short effectiveness. Therefore, this cannot be considered an argument that no stamp duty is required."

### Wang Cheng Ying Hosts Philanthropists

### Feixindun Discusses Peaceful Dissolution of Shantytowns

Not Wanting to See the Five-Booklet Tragedy Again, Willing to Sacrifice More Than 60,000 Yuan

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that Feixindun, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, told a representative of the Greater Shanghai Evening Post this morning (May 1st) that the Municipal Council is willing to peacefully dissolve the Yangshupu shantytowns and does not want to see bloodshed or loss of life as a result. Even sacrificing 70,000 yuan to subsidize the shantytowns is acceptable. The Municipal Council met with 22 representatives of the shantytowns yesterday and agreed to subsidize each household with 14 yuan for demolition costs. A total of 476 households will require more than 66,000 yuan. The demolition is scheduled to begin on May 6th, and all materials, etc., must be moved out by the 8th. The representative of the Greater Shanghai Evening Post asked what would be done if the remaining 5,000 shantytowns in the concession requested subsidies based on precedent. Feixindun replied that he did not want to see the Five-Booklet case again, and since those people had lost their homes, it would be appropriate to provide some assistance from the perspective of ordinary humanity and ethics. He said that the shantytowns must clean up their addresses on their own. If they still have not done so by May 8th, then Jimson, the director of the Public Works Department, said that the subsidy of 14 yuan would be forfeited. According to the method agreed upon yesterday, the money will be issued on May 10th.

### Jiangsu Province Small-Scale Loan Office Expands Business Scope

### New Method for Saving Machine Oil

Using the "Luber-finer" Oil Refiner

China's construction has advanced rapidly in recent years, with highways reaching all directions. As a result, the number of automobiles has increased sharply, and industry has also progressed, with more factories being built and the demand for various internal combustion engines gradually increasing. However, no matter what type of automobile or internal combustion engine is used, the machine oil will inevitably become cloudy and lose its original lubricating ability after prolonged use. If it is not changed for a long time, it will directly damage the machine itself, indirectly reduce the machine's capacity, and increase repair costs. Therefore, the consumption of machine oil is increasing day by day, becoming almost an unavoidable fact. According to a research report by American oil experts, although machine oil has been used for a long time, its essence does not decay. The reason why it loses its lubricating ability is that external dust, carbon, and fine metal particles gradually mix in. Chemically, the carbon contained in the oil oxidizes and synthesizes into acid when heated, which can erode various parts of the machine. Furthermore, unstable oils in the oil can gradually decompose and mix with the above-mentioned impurities to form a thick, dark, and turbid substance that obscures the machine and completely isolates the machine body from the machine oil. Therefore, old machine oil not only cannot fulfill its lubricating function but can also erode the machine, making it easy to damage. A report from the American Automobile Chamber of Commerce stated that 80% of the reasons for automobile damage are due to unclean machine oil. The essence of machine oil does not decay, but it can still be used if the impurities are filtered out. This kind of machine oil refining business has had some success in European and American countries for the past 22 years since 1914. However, the greatest success is the Luber-finer oil refiner of the American Bliss Company. The world's machine oil refining experts have 26 inventions regarding machine oil refining methods. Most of the refining plants of the major American oil factories are planned by him. After the completion of large-scale oil refining projects, Bliss saw that the machine oil used on automobiles and various internal combustion engines often had to be discarded and replaced, which was too uneconomical. However, the owners and manufacturers of various vehicles are scattered in all directions, and in fact, they cannot transport a small amount of used oil to the oil factory for refining. Therefore, a most convenient automatic oil refiner is installed on automobiles and internal combustion engines so that all impurities in the oil are filtered out at any time, so that the machine oil can always be kept pure and does not need to be changed. Therefore, although the appearance of the Luber-finer is extremely convenient, its function is no different from a miniature machine oil refining plant. The most obvious benefits after installing the Luber-finer are: (1) The oil is pure and does not decay over time, saving replacement costs; (2) The machine body is not easily damaged, saving repair costs; (3) The engine capacity is strengthened, saving fuel costs.

### Gasoline Starts a Fire, A Family Dies Tragically

Skin Flayed, Flesh Torn, Hair All Gone - The Catastrophe of the Dong Qingfu Family

Dong Qingfu, a native of Ningbo, was 35 years old. He lived in the guest room of Building No. 3, Yanqing Lane, Pudong Police Station Road. He made a living by doing laundry. At 9:00 PM on the 30th, Dong had received a large batch of sailor uniforms from a warship during the day and needed to wash them with gasoline, so he prepared half a bottle of gasoline and put it in the room. At that time, Dong had just finished eating and drinking and went to bed to sleep, but he still had a cigarette butt in his mouth. In a daze, he threw it on the ground. The sparks touched the gasoline and caught fire, breaking the bottle and spreading the flames in all directions, burning the bed curtains. Dong woke up and tried to escape, but in a panic, he couldn't find the door. His wife, Lin, and his six-year-old daughter, Jinlan, his four-year-old son, Jingen, and his four-month-old daughter, Yinlan, were all sound asleep. They were awakened in a panic and cried out in alarm as their bodies caught fire. At that time, the other residents of the folk house had not yet gone to bed. Hearing the alarm, they urgently knocked open the door and used well water to extinguish the fire. The police officers from the Pudong Branch and the fire trucks from the Pudong District Fire Brigade had all arrived and rescued the five people separately and sent them to the Pudong Hospital for treatment. Because the injuries were all critical, the branch director, Zhang Mingqin, consulted with doctors Xu and Qian to provide careful treatment. However, the pain suffered by the five people was so severe that their skin was flayed, their flesh torn, and all their hair was gone. At that time, there was a scene of crying and misery in the hospital. In the end, due to the severity of their injuries, the four-year-old child and Dong himself died one after another at midnight the day before yesterday. Lin was swollen all over and died at around 0:00 PM yesterday, following them. The six-year-old daughter was still unconscious last night and was in extremely critical condition. Only the infant, with a burnt right hand and right ear, was able to drink milk powder. After the tragedy occurred, the viewers were all saddened. Now, Dong's brother and Lin's mother's family are jointly preparing coffins to collect the remains of the three dead.

### The Circumstances of the Bad Check Scam Involving the Xinguang Underwear Company

Someone Claiming to be a Shop Assistant from Yu Tianshun in Hangzhou Used a Postdated Check to Purchase Goods and Pocket the Change

The Xinguang Standard Underwear Company, located at No. 13, Xiaoyou Lane, Gujia Lane, 26 Luban Road, French Concession, reported to the French Police that the Huaqiao Sock Factory in Baxianqiao had counterfeited its registered trademark. The police seized 281 pieces of counterfeit underwear and counterfeit trademarks and detained Zhang Chulin, the manager of Huaqiao, for prosecution in the Second Special Court. Xinguang Underwear Company also filed an incidental civil suit, requesting the recovery of losses of 5,675 yuan. As a result, Zhang Chulin was fined 400 yuan.

Incidental Civil Suit

Transferred to the Civil Court for trial, Zhang refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, which was rejected. The civil suit part is now subject to an independent lawsuit filed by Ji Guangchi, the manager of Xinguang Underwear Company, against Zhang, and is still under trial. The above circumstances have been reported in the press repeatedly. Recently, Xinguang Underwear Company encountered a bad check scam. On the 22nd of last month, a man named Hu Jiren, claiming to be a shop assistant from Yu Tianshun in Sanyuanfang, Hangzhou, about 40 years old and speaking with a Shaoxing accent, came to Xinguang Underwear Company to purchase goods. A staff member,

Surnamed Li, Received Him

And selected more than a dozen dozens of various underwear, priced at 509 yuan and 6 jiao. He paid with a check from Hangzhou Yu Tianshun's main store to the Shanghai Yongda Bank for 600 yuan, dated April 28. As the Xinguang accountant was out, Hu instructed them to send the change of 90 yuan and 4 jiao, in the form of a check dated April 30, to Room 181 of the Asia Hotel on Sanma Road. All goods were to be sent to Shen Da on Aidoa Road after the check had cleared.

Forwarding Company

To be shipped to Hangzhou. Li Long, an employee of Xinguang Underwear Company, believing that Hu was a sincere first-time customer, issued a receipt for the 600-yuan check and handed it to Hu. That evening, the accountant returned and issued a check dated April 30 for 90 yuan and 4 jiao from the Zhafei Road branch of the Continental Bank, and sent someone to the Asia Hotel on Sanma Road to give it to Hu. On April 28, Xinguang Underwear Company submitted the Yongda Bank check to the Zhafei Road branch of the Continental Bank for

Collection and Deposit

Unexpectedly, that afternoon, they received a telephone call from the Continental Bank branch notifying them that the check had been returned, and that Hangzhou Yu Tianshun had no dealings with Yongda Bank. Xinguang immediately stopped payment on the check dated the 30th by telephone. After the Continental Bank checked the account, it was found that the check had been cashed by someone at the Jiujiang Road head office on the 24th of the same month. The date on the check was the 20th of April. Upon closer inspection, the date on the check had been altered with chemicals. At this point, Xinguang Underwear Company

Realized They Had Been Scammed

Fortunately, the goods had not been shipped, and the loss was light. They immediately reported the information to the French Police and requested an investigation. The police found that the Huaan Department Store at 666 Zhafei Road had also been scammed out of 137 yuan using the same method on May 25 of last year. All the stamps were exactly the same. This was the second time. The precinct has ordered all detectives to strictly investigate the swindler and bring him to justice.

### A Kidnapping and Extortion Case is Uncovered in the Kidnapping of Mao Zhikang

The Extortion Letter Was Cut, Pasted, and Assembled; Most of the Defendants Confessed to Living

At No. 9 Rugao Road. Mao Zhaodong (also known as Shengyuan), whose sixteen-year-old son, Zhikang, was lured away by bandits at noon on the 4th of last month, along with a fourteen-year-old boy named Qian Sandi, were tricked into a flat in the vicinity of Qianlai Temple, in the southeast of Nanhui County. The two children were hidden in an underground hole. Nine letters were sent to Mao's father, demanding a ransom of 10,000 yuan, or Mao's son would be killed. Subsequently, Shao Jingfan, a Chinese detective from the Jiaxing Road police station, along with detectives Xu Yongyuan, Chen Ruisheng, Liu Longchao, etc., cracked the case and apprehended the kidnappers Mei Fufu from Pudong, Wang Jinlin and Yang Zhitian from Haiyan, Pan Binsheng from Changzhou, and the suspect Qian Rongsheng (Mei's maternal uncle), the landlord of the house, and five others. The circumstances of Mao's son's kidnapping were quite peculiar, resembling a theatrical play. The criminals were escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Details have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhong Qing specially opened Criminal Court No. 1 for preliminary examination. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated that during the adjournment, it was discovered that the defendants Mei Fufu and Pan Binsheng had written two threatening letters to Gu Qin, the widow of Ningbo, at No. 142 Rugao Road, on January 9 and 12 of last year, extorting 2,000 yuan. The second letter contained a Mauser pistol and half a spent bullet, threatening her life. The bullet was called "a celestial elixir; if you don't give it, please drink it," and so on. Around 2 p.m. on the 13th of the same month, someone was sent to the Xian Shi rooftop theater to make contact, wearing a suit and carrying a hot water bottle as a sign. Ms. Gu, upon receiving the information, reported to the police station and borrowed Chinese and foreign detectives to go to the theater, but they were unable to apprehend anyone. Ms. Gu knew that Mei Fufu was her neighbor, and Mei once falsely claimed to Ms. Gu that he could mediate in the threatening letter matter. Ms. Gu didn't know that it was him who did it and claimed that she had reported it to the police station. It was found that the two defendants, Mei and Pan, were spying at the theater at the time, and upon seeing Ms. Gu with the detectives, they dared not negotiate and fled. The two threatening letters were written by Mei and Pan at several fortune-telling stalls, each writing a few sentences, then cutting them out with scissors and pasting them together to form sentences, making it difficult to verify the handwriting. The plan devised by Mei and Pan was unique, comparable to the kidnapping case. Several months later, Mei borrowed another 200 yuan from Ms. Gu. Regarding the kidnapping case, the police also retrieved a sheathed sword-style bayonet, which Mei and Pan were carrying while impersonating soldiers, along with the two threatening letters, from the Nanhui Police Bureau and submitted them for inspection. Subsequently, Gu Qin, the woman from Ningbo, and the two kidnapped children, Mao and Qian, testified about the events (details omitted). When questioned, Mei Fufu confessed that he had wanted to create a magic troupe to go to the Northwest, but the plan failed, so he resorted to this tactic. Wang Jinlin and Yang Zhitian both claimed to be plasterers, and Mei's father was an architect, so they knew each other. They wrote letters to Chang'an and invited Shen to come. The remaining confessions were evasive. Pan Baosheng also confessed that he was helping Mei. The blind man Qian Rongsheng insisted that he knew nothing about the kidnapping and asked for leniency. Judge Zhong ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and await a scheduled sentencing.

### A Record of the Grand Opening Ceremony of the Golden Grand Theater

More than 1,000 Guests Attended, including Yu Qiaqing; Meng Xiaodong and Others Cut the Ribbon; Du Yuesheng Unveiled the Plaque

The Golden Grand Theater in Baxianqiao, this city, was recently taken over by the prominent Mr. Jin Tingsun, who has thoroughly renovated it. The entire renovation was completed and the grand opening ceremony was held at 4 p.m. on the previous (1st) day. More than 1,000 guests from all walks of life attended, including Huang Jinrong, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, Gao Xinbao, Sun Meitang, Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Shankun, Lu Jingshi, Zhang Binghui, Wang Shaoqi, Wang Zhinan, Xie Baosheng, and famous actors such as Shang Xiaoyun and Li Wanchun. After the ceremony was performed according to etiquette, Meng Xiaodong, Lu Sujuan, Chan Eyoon, and three ladies cut the ribbon, and Mr. Du Yuesheng unveiled the plaque. Then Mr. Du delivered the opening speech, expressing his admiration for the theater's abolition of programs and thorough innovation, creating a new era for Peking opera. Guests Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, and others then gave speeches, praising the theater. Finally, the owner of the theater, Mr. Jin Tingsun, delivered a thank-you speech, hoping that all sectors would give more guidance to revive China's inherent art and promote national essence. The ceremony ended at 5:30 p.m. It was heard that the theater was packed with patrons that evening, and ticket sales were particularly enthusiastic.

### The Lawyers' Association Strives to Abolish Consular Jurisdiction

Sending Letters to Various Associations, Requesting Unified Advocacy

The Lawyers' Association of the Republic of China, regarding the issue of abolishing consular jurisdiction, after a resolution by the Standing Committee, appointed Liu Luming, the director of the association, to collect materials on the harm of consular jurisdiction to China, translate them into Chinese and English declarations, and send them to the legal circles of various countries around the world to seek their sympathy and assistance.

### The Case of Handwriting Identification: Wei Zhiqiu is Transferred to Wu County for Investigation

Lawyer Shen Xiaoxiang is Fortunate to be Acquitted; Shanghai Courts Decline to Prosecute Twice

Lawyer Shen Xiaoxiang, a native of Fujian, has been practicing law in Shanghai for five years. Che Lisheng, a rickshaw merchant in Zhabei, was accused of exploitative usury and acquitted by the local court. Unexpectedly, after the court's judgment in the case, it received an anonymous letter of attack from someone named Hua De, falsely accusing the judge of accepting a bribe of 1,500 yuan. President Lu sent the late Chief Clerk Xuan Maohe to investigate, and summoned the parties and witnesses to the concluded case, as well as the lawyer, to the court to compare handwriting. They mistakenly identified the letter as written by Shen Xiaoxiang and transferred it for investigation. Shen Xiaoxiang immediately stated that the letter was written by Wei Zhiqiu, the president of the Tiantian Service Agency and principal of the Lixiao Elementary School, located at No. 53 Yuqing Lane, Gonghe Road, and his relative Zhao Lanzhi, who was the plaintiff against Che Lisheng. His handwriting must be Wei Zhiqiu's. The former prosecutor, Li, submitted Shen Xiaoxiang's handwriting to calligrapher Wang Xishen for identification, but it was found to be the same. As a result, Shen Xiaoxiang was prosecuted. When Judge Yi Jun heard the case, Shen requested another identification, but it was denied. He was sentenced to one year of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of civil rights. Shen refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Jiangsu Higher Court. Huang Bingdao, the presiding judge of the Fourth Criminal Court, along with Judges Li Yue and Wang Shicheng, and Prosecutor Zhu Jun, heard the case. They believed that the evidence presented by Shen Xiaoxiang against Wei Zhiqiu was highly suspicious. Therefore, they secretly sent the handwriting evidence left by Wei to the Forensic Institute of the Ministry of Judicial Administration for identification. On February 4 of this year, the identification results confirmed that Wei Zhiqiu's handwriting had as many as six special strokes that were similar to the original defamatory letter. This was due to the natural habits developed during personal writing. Therefore, after the retrial on April 9 of this year, at Shen Xiaoxiang's request, Chan Zhiqiuzhi was transferred to the High Procuratorate for detention. At the same time, Shen Xiaoxian was acquitted, redressing the injustice. As the first instance of Wei Zhiqiu's crime fell under the jurisdiction of the local court, and the Shanghai local court had twice declined to prosecute Wei, the High Court instructed the Wu County local court's procuratorate to take charge of the investigation.

### Wang Ziping Specialized in Stealing Clothes from Dance Halls, Implicating Pawnshop Manager

Pawning Five Overcoats in One Hour; His Western Attire Prevented Suspicion

Wang Ziping, a young man from Ningbo (21 years old), had recently gone to various dance halls, such as the Datong, International, and Yangzi, to steal the overcoats, hats, scarves, and gloves of the dancers for pawning. He was apprehended by Cao Qishan, a Chinese detective from the Old Gate Police Station, and sentenced to two years of imprisonment by the First Special Court. The police found that the clothes stolen by Wang had been pawned at the Jiyuan Pawnshop at No. 144 Wusong Road. On the morning of March 28, between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m., he pawned five overcoats, three hats, three scarves, and two pairs of gloves at the pawnshop in two trips within an hour. The pawnshop accepted all of them. Suspecting intentional acceptance of stolen goods, they submitted a request to the First Special District Court, which issued a summons. Yesterday, the manager of the pawnshop, Zhao Dexing, was summoned to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Zhang Shizhu, the police lawyer, prosecuted him for receiving stolen goods under Article 349 of the Criminal Code. Zhao argued that when Wang came to pawn the clothes, he was wearing Western attire and did not look like a thief. Moreover, there was no record of the stolen items in the police's loss reports, so he did not suspect him of being a thief and accepted the pawn. Therefore, he should not be held responsible for receiving stolen goods. Lawyer Ting Sunzu also defended him. Judge Ye Shengchao verified the confessions and concluded the debate on the case, scheduling a sentencing date.

### The Xinghua Noodle Company Held a Shareholders' Meeting Yesterday

### Postal Knowledge Q&A

(Twenty-Two)

Q: Mr. Xu Lemin from Nanjing asks: ⑴ Can texts written or printed with carbon paper be sent as printed matter with the appropriate postage? ⑵ If the purchase orders, stamps, money orders, etc. that are mailed do not have handwritten documents attached, can they be sent as registered printed matter without paying for registered mail?

A: ⑴ Texts printed with carbon paper can be sent as printed matter if twenty or more copies are mailed to the post office at the same time, and the texts are always the same; otherwise, they should be charged as letters. ⑵ It is not possible to answer what kind of style the so-called book buyers are because the letter has not been explained. You can bring the original list to the nearby post office for inquiries. Stamps that have not been cancelled, except those affixed to the envelope or packaging and included in the mail as postage for the recipient, must be charged as letters regardless of whether they are registered or not. The same applies to money orders. If it is a postal money order, it should be sealed and mailed in a registered letter.

Q: I have a fountain pen that I want to mail to another place to ask a friend to repair it. Can I send it as a sample? What are the detailed procedures?

A: The samples stipulated in the postal regulations refer to the products produced or sold by factories or businesses, and are only accepted as samples without a selling price. The goods ordered by factories or businesses from customers and any items mailed by individuals, regardless of the quantity, shall not be accepted as samples. The fountain pen you want to send is not a sample from a factory or business, so it cannot be regarded as a sample and should be mailed as a parcel or small package. Small parcels are small items that are sent together with letters and can be sent to the same place as letters. Since the volume of the fountain pen is small, it is more cost-effective to send it as a small parcel. The main points of the sending procedure are described as follows: depending on the distance of the journey, refer to the method of packing parcels, use a thick cardboard box or a small book box for packing, and indicate the words "small package" on the package. Pay a fee of five cents for every 100 grams, and affix enough postage, starting at least from 30 cents. (If it is to or from Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, the fee should be doubled. For Xinjiang, the fee is the same as for letters.) If you want to register, express register, or send it by airmail, you should pay the additional fee separately.

The maximum weight of each small package is one kilogram, and its dimensions shall not exceed 60 centimeters in length, and the sum of length, width, and thickness shall be 90 centimeters. If it is packed in a roll, the sum of twice the diameter and its length shall be limited to 100 centimeters, and its length shall not exceed 80 centimeters. It can be sent to all parts of the country.

### Ji Yunqing's Grand Celebration

Mr. Wei Yunqing, a prominent figure in Shanghai, is a man of great virtue and high age, and is happy to do good deeds. In his early years, he served in the military and political circles and made great achievements. He usually helps people solve problems and can be compared with Lu Lian. He is admired by all, and people are grateful. Mr. Wei is chivalrous by nature and has more than three thousand disciples. Today (May 3rd, the 23rd day of the third lunar month) is Mr. Wei's 70th birthday. At first, Mr. Wei, witnessing the difficulties of the times, did not want to open the wine and celebrate a waste of material resources. However, how can we celebrate the birthday of a person who has contributed to society and has reached the age of seventy? Therefore, friends Xue Dubi, Wu Peifu, Song Zheyuan, Jiao Yitang, Huang Jinrong, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Xiaolai, etc. initiated a birthday celebration, which was scheduled to be held at the Jade Buddha Temple on Binlang Road this afternoon, with a vegetarian banquet prepared, and drinks. Mr. Wei declined firmly, but was unsuccessful, and decided to move the birthday ceremony to Putuoshan Road, not only for the convenience of travel, but also to have a good reputation. Therefore, the traffic on Binlang Road was heavy and it was extremely grand for a while.

### Ancient Cannon Dug Up from the Shoal Outside Wusongkou

Found 30 Feet Underwater; Recovered by the Jianshe Dredger; The Shoal Dredging Project is Extremely Smooth; The Chief Engineer Retires and Returns to England

A cannon was recently dredged up from the shoal outside Wusongkou by the Jianshe dredger of the River Conservancy Bureau. The dredging of the shoal is progressing very smoothly. A reporter from Datong News Agency explored and recorded the following information from the bureau:

Ancient Cannon Dug Up from the Shoal

The Jianshe No. 6 dredger of the River Conservancy Bureau was carrying out dredging work at the shoal outside Wusongkou last Tuesday afternoon when it dredged up a cannon from a depth of 30 feet below the surface of the water. The cannon is 7 feet 2 inches long, the diameter of the cannon belly is 13.5 inches, the diameter of the muzzle is 4 inches, and it weighs 1,400 pounds. The old crew (McMuricb (British)) reported the discovery of the cannon to the bureau, and the cannon is currently stored on the Jianshe dredger.

Dredging Progresses Smoothly

Since the bureau began a large-scale dredging project at the shoal, the progress has been very smooth. About 2 million cubic yards of soil have been dredged up. However, the shoal is located in the waterway and must avoid passing ships during dredging at night, which is very dangerous. Therefore, the work is still limited to daytime. Regarding the second large dredger, after it was still contracted to the German Xue Gao Company, the bureau has sent engineer Smith from the dredging engineering department to Germany to supervise the work. It is expected to be completed by the end of next year.

Mr. Chester Retires and Returns to China

After the bureau's engineer Dr. Chester was approved to be replaced by engineer Xue Zhuobin (Engineer Hua Lai had been invited to fill the position), he was scheduled to return to England on the British company's mail ship Ranpura on the 11th of this month. All the staff of the bureau felt sad about his retirement after serving the bureau for more than 20 years. A public banquet will be held in the next few days to see him off.

### The Jianghai Bank Held an Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting Yesterday

### Dancer Arrested for Smoking Opium

Spirit flagging, she fell to the ground. The high heels of her shoes also broke off.

Zhang Juzhen, stage name Hai Jianren, a dancer in the Peach Blossom River dance troupe in the Great World, is thirty years old. Skilled in makeup, she looks like a beautiful young woman in her twenties. With a delicate face and slender figure, she is popular with dance patrons and earns a good living. However, she is addicted to opium. At 4 PM the day before yesterday, she went with her younger sister, Wang Xiuying, to an opium den run by Li Haizhou, a Nanjing native, in a room on the second floor at No. 30 Mikebao Road, Ba Xianqiao, in the French Concession, to indulge in opium. While they were inhaling the smoke, Chinese and Western detectives from the French Concession Police raided the den. The owner, Li Haizhou, was out, so his wife, Li Wangshi, and Zhang Juzhen and Wang Xiuying were all arrested. Opium paraphernalia including a lamp and one pipe and three opium bowls were confiscated and taken back to the police station. The next day, they were sent to the First Criminal Division of the Special Court. Judge Chen Shuoying interrogated them. The lawyer from the Police Department prosecuted them according to the law. The defendants stubbornly denied smoking opium. The court ordered the defendants to be detained for a medical examination to determine if they were addicted to opium, and the trial was postponed. When Zhang Juzhen was brought out of the detention room, she looked haggard and exhausted because she had been detained day and night. Her body was weak and her high-heeled leather shoes could not support her, so she slipped and fell to the ground. The high heels of both shoes broke off at the same time, causing the audience to laugh. The bailiffs stopped them. It is hoped that all men and women of the same race will quit opium addiction as soon as possible to avoid legal sanctions and suffering.

Discussion

### Thoughts Inspired by "Declining Birthday Celebrations"

— Meng Ruo

It's quite a coincidence that several important figures in our party and country have reached significant birthdays in the past six months. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday just passed, followed by Chairman Lin's 70th birthday. Now it's President Yu's 60th birthday. In the past, the whole country celebrated Chairman Chiang's birthday by donating airplanes. On Chairman Lin's birthday, the National Government presented a gift of 200,000 yuan as a scholarship fund to leave a lasting memory. These are all very meaningful and different from ordinary birthday celebrations. For President Yu's birthday, various parties were also planning to hold celebrations. Judging from Mr. Yu's qualifications as a founding member of the party and country, he deserves to be praised by everyone. However, President Yu is very modest and vehemently declined, believing that at this time of national crisis, when we should be striving for development, both economic resources and time are insufficient. He resolutely cannot waste them on meaningless birthday celebrations. This is enough to show Mr. Yu's character.

Moreover, I feel that President Yu's refusal to celebrate his birthday contains two good lessons that others can emulate. This can be seen from Mr. Yu's conversation with the central reporters. Mr. Yu said, "If this trend starts, I, as the president of the Yuan, celebrate my birthday today, and then the ministers, vice-ministers, directors, and provincial governors and chairmen will also celebrate their birthdays tomorrow. This cycle of celebrations will never end, causing suffering for the general staff who live on salaries. After giving gifts to their superiors, there is almost nothing left for them to live on. How can they be motivated and focus on serving the country?" In our officialdom, some superiors are often heard celebrating birthdays. Fifty or seventy, of course, must be celebrated, but even twenty or forty are often celebrated with great fanfare. In this way, the superiors naturally receive both benefits, while the subordinates inevitably groan inwardly. Therefore, President Yu's refusal to celebrate his birthday is setting an example, which is worthy of our praise.

Mr. Yu went on to say, "As for those who celebrate my birthday with words, of course, they are full of flattering words, which are nauseating to look at. What is the use of this for us revolutionaries?" This view is also very transcendent. All birthday wishes in writing are going to be full of flattering words, especially from subordinates to superiors, who must praise them excessively. When important figures celebrate their birthdays, various parties compete to offer birthday greetings, all doing their best to flatter them. If the person being praised is a person of noble character and great achievements, they can be worthy of it. But if they are corrupt and occupy positions without merit, it is simply like deliberately mocking them, and it is not just nauseating to look at. For example, Yin Rugeng, the traitor, was guilty of heinous crimes, as everyone knew. He recently celebrated his fortieth birthday, and some people sent him birthday greetings that were also full of flattering words. It is clear that President Yu's unwillingness to have people offer flattering words is also a unique expression.

Therefore, those who admire Mr. Yu should accept Mr. Yu's wishes from now on, "I hope that all friendly comrades will be loyal to their duties, be honest and dedicated, and contribute to the country's development, which is better than giving me gifts and words."

### Life in the Shipyard

— Wu Qi

— Notes from Hong Kong

One Sunday evening, I was returning from bathing in "Lai Chi Kok" and passed through Queen's Road when I unexpectedly ran into Zhao Cheng, whom I hadn't seen for more than six years and whose whereabouts were unknown. His appearance almost shocked me. He was as thin as a bundle of firewood, with a face full of stubble, as if he had just been released from prison. Judging from his dress, I knew he was working. His clothes, face, and arms were all covered in grease. Before I could ask, he told me that he was a "shipyard worker."

We went into a teahouse. He was still the same taciturn person, with sharp, shining eyes always pondering something. After sitting down and drinking tea, he told me in detail about the hardships and sufferings he had encountered since we last met. Some of the situations made me shudder! Made me shed tears! But he said sternly, "Lao Wu! Do you think my experiences are too tragic? Don't think that way! When the suffering is over, the sweetness will come! I haven't shed a tear or sighed in all these years! I only know to overcome all difficulties and move forward!" A series of words grabbed my heart like sharp claws. Then he began to tell me about the lives of the shipyard workers.

"Let me first talk about the lives of those coolies: work starts at seven o'clock every morning, with non-stop carrying, lifting, moving, and transporting. Until noon, when their stomachs are empty and flat, they are allowed to go out to eat. Including eating and resting, they only have one hour. As soon as the time is up, they have to rush back to the hellish factory to continue bleeding and sweating. Everything in the factory, even the air, is ugly and cruel. They work until their backs ache, their legs hurt, and their heads are dizzy before they can endure until the 'end of work.' They drag their accumulated fatigue from the day out of the factory and go back to rest. Every day is like this. They have to obediently follow the instructions of the foreman and endure his manipulation and bullying. Because almost all of these factory coolies have family burdens.

## Page 20

If they don't work for a day or two, they will go hungry. The foreman saw this move clearly and seized on the weakness to deal with these poor coolies even more harshly. Therefore, he bought many 'piglets' to be his loyal slaves. The coolies who are the foreman's 'piglets' are afraid of not having work, so for the sake of their wives, children, and the elderly, they have to give the foreman five cents a day as a 'kickback' and be 'piglets.' Sometimes, when the foreman orders them to carry something, he tells thirty coolies to carry it, but he only sends twenty people. As a result, the wages of ten coolies flow into the foreman's pocket effortlessly. Think about how they live? They have wives and children, all of whom are opening their mouths asking him for food, but their blood is being sucked dry by others, and their children and wives are gnawing on their bones!

I should also tell you about the lives of the 'lathe' workers and the 'grinding' workers. I am a 'grinding' worker. People who do these two jobs have to go through five years of apprenticeship. During the five years, they are beaten and scolded by the master. If everything is recorded without omission, it will become a refined work. In the first year, the master gives you one cent and five cents a month. You endure hardship and bitterness for five years. When you are a fully trained apprentice, you have to respectfully offer thirty-five yuan to the foreman in the machine room for 'tea money.' Only then can you get the foreman's permission to be a 'piglet' under him. If you don't spend this 'tea money,' then don't think about having a job. But giving 'tea money' is not the end. You also have to obey the condition of 'kickback.' Their daily wage is one dollar and twenty-three cents, and the 'kickback' starts from here. The amount of the deduction is generally one-third. My wage is one dollar and forty cents a day, but after deducting one 'kickback,' I only have ninety cents left. What can I do? I deeply understand what suffering is and understand where our suffering comes from!"

I was moved by his narration and couldn't say a word. Looking at his thin face and those eyes that hid countless angers, I felt a kind of shame! But I didn't know how to comfort him at all? I simply couldn't find words and sentences in my mind to comfort him.

### Song of Famine

— Mo Wenming

When he stepped out of the black gate of the prison, he had a dispirited mood.

He had been sentenced to imprisonment for some minor thefts, detained in prison, and after serving his term, he was released again. This was already the third time.

His hair, which had not been washed for three months, was long and disheveled, scattered behind his head. His complexion appeared even paler than before, and his gaze was slow and dull, ghostlike in the warm sunlight of April. He took off his worn-out coat, which was full of small holes and oil stains, and carefully pinched the lice.

He was always so kind, and he never cursed the misfortune that fate had given him. It seemed that he was born to be like this, and he did not want to blame heaven. He let the days pass in loneliness and suffering, and he still smiled.

"Who shouldn't have a period of misfortune?"

He was an absolute fatalist.

The prison left a beautiful impression on him. It was just like his home. He often thought this way. If he hadn't had any food for three days, he would go back to his "old home."

The prison was indeed not a bad place. Here, you don't have to worry about starving to death, and you don't have to calculate other living needs. Every day there are three meals of yellow rice, and it doesn't cost money. Although being confined in this cage seems uncomfortable, what does that matter? Where else in the world is there a more lovable place?

In front of the iron bars, there are "friends" with guns guarding you all day long. The prison is a paradise for homeless vagrants! ...

He recalled, a wisp of happy smile hanging on his cheek. He became sad again for his unwarranted release.

He began to stroll lazily onto Xiafei Road.

This was a busy city street, with many food shops on both sides of the road. The shop windows displayed those exquisite Western pastries, waving to him as if inviting him on purpose, and he felt a little hungry. Yes, it had been a full eight hours since morning that he had not eaten a piece of bread.

He looked at them greedily, swallowing the faint saliva in his mouth. He thought, the taste of that purple chocolate-like cream cake must be good, right? But he couldn't get these. He felt in the pocket of his coat, and there was only one cent left inside.

He shook his head in disappointment and walked to a pancake stall at the corner, where he ate his dinner proudly.

But how could a thin pancake satisfy him? He was not a city boy with a stomach ailment! So he thought of his old profession. He began to stand on the street and beg from every passerby in a miserable voice.

In this world, apart from someone occasionally dropping a cent out of curiosity or disgust, who really gives with compassion? He tried his best to endure every contemptuous gaze, but no one threw down half a cent.

This made him angry, and the hunger in his stomach forced him to solve this physiological need urgently. He thought of the simplest and most powerful method. In this situation, of course, there was no room for rational consideration. He rushed madly towards a French gentleman walking towards him.

The French gentleman almost fell down when he was bumped into, and in that brief moment, he quickly snatched the gold pocket watch hanging from the gentleman's inner pocket. He ran into the cross street with the same swift steps.

Of course, things were not so simple. The French gentleman shouted wildly, and the standing police officer chased after him like a hunting dog, and he was caught again.

He was sent to his "home" for the fourth time.
