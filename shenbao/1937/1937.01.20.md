[Xuzhou] Recently, people from Shaanxi Province have said that Xi'an is filled with red terror. According to statistics from the Public Security Bureau, more than 3,000 households have moved out.

Regarding the path to resolving the Shaanxi Incident, a large number of Red Bandits have joined Yang Hucheng's troops and are moving east. The front line is feeling the pressure, but no conflict has occurred. The sound of gunfire east of Chishui was due to a local misunderstanding between Yang and Zhang's troops. The Central Army is only adopting a monitoring and containment stance. All parties are still working to prevent the situation from deteriorating. Wang Shuchang visited Mo Dehui and Liu Zhe on the afternoon of the 19th and talked for an hour.

(19th Reuters Dispatch)

[Nanjing] According to transportation circles, although most of the foreign nationals in Xi'an have safely escaped to Tongguan by bus, not all of them have arrived.

Recently, the situation in Guanzhong has been chaotic, and military movements have been frequent, their intention to sell out the nation and subvert the country is obvious. They are insane, isolated from humanity, and truly resented by both gods and men and intolerable by heaven and earth. The Central Government has an inescapable duty to rectify discipline and uphold the foundation of the country and should no longer tolerate and accommodate them. They should resolutely make a decision, promptly issue an order to suppress the rebels, and fully quell the rebellion, and Zhang Xueliang should be immediately and publicly punished as a warning to those who endanger the country and stir up trouble. If any of our citizens have a breath left, we vow to be the central government's backing to exterminate the ugly elements. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Fellow Northeasterners Residing in Beiping and Tianjin Issue a Letter to the Northeastern Soldiers

"Unite and Obey the Central Government or Surrender a Unit to the Central Government"

[Nanjing] Fellow Northeasterners residing in Beiping and Tianjin believe that the internal situation in Shaanxi is complicated, with the Qin Army rebelling and the Communists infiltrating, which has a significant impact on the future of the country and the nation. They have recently issued a tearful letter to the Northeastern soldiers, containing over a hundred words filled with tears and sincere emotion. The following is an excerpt of the key points: ㊀ Being Used by the Communists Will Only Lead to Sacrifice: The Communists are insidious, treacherous, ruthless, and inhumane. To date, how many thousands of good people and military officers have been killed? You may be used temporarily at the beginning, but you will inevitably suffer a brutal massacre in an instant. If you continue to obey the Central Government, even if you are not rewarded, you will not suffer this disaster. Even if you are dissatisfied with your treatment, you will not be slaughtered without resistance. Which is better, please consider carefully. ㊁ The Communists are at the End of Their Rope: Do Not Join Them Now: Although there is an opportunity to take advantage of in Shaanxi, it is only a brief resurgence. If you are tempted at this time, it will not be worth it. Observe that the central government's unification is already established and international power is gradually increasing. If you do this, wouldn't you be abandoning the light for darkness, preferring death over life? Which is better, please consider carefully. ㊂ The Southeast of Shaanxi and Gansu Provinces is Blocked, While the Northwest is Dangerous: Throughout history, heroes and great bandits who have risen up there have never been able to maintain their position permanently or have met their demise sooner or later. The Communists cannot even establish themselves in southern Jiangxi, let alone in Shaanxi and Gansu. Among you, there are many who know military affairs and surely understand this. This is something that even the unwise can understand. Please consider carefully. ㊃ Gathering of Heroes Will Inevitably Lead to Defeat: Today, there are the Qin Army, the Communists, and you in Shaanxi. Who dares to trust each other? Who would not engage in secret calculations? Engage in intrigues. What will happen if the Northeast Army, the Qin Army, and the Communists join forces? Moreover, each unit is divided into two or more factions. What will happen then? Ask yourself, what are Yang Hucheng and Sun Weiru like? What is the situation with the 17th Route Army and the Garrison Brigade? What is the situation with Zhu Mao and the two Xus? What about the Southern Communists, the Northern Communists, the Old Communists, and the New Communists? Even within the Northeast Army, can they be united? This is impossible. Fellow Northeasterners, we are truly worried about you and do not know how to ensure your safety. Please consider carefully. What has been said above only concerns a corner of Shaanxi and Gansu. The danger is already this great. If we consider the will of the people of the whole country and the full strength of the Central Government, there is nothing that is not dangerous. Because the bandit leaders who have not received military education cannot fight hard battles with regular troops, and the officers who come from the ranks cannot fight hard battles with regular troops either. Most of you have received considerable military education and can calculate all of this one by one. It is truly chilling. However, in our view, it is only a matter of your thoughts. Not only can you turn danger into safety, but you can also turn misfortune into blessing. If you are thinking of your ancestors' graves, your parents, your wives, your children, your country, your nation, your homeland, then the four words "correcting the wrong" sum it all up. It is also possible to unite and obey the Central Government or surrender a unit to the Central Government, to take the head of the Communist bandits and kill them to avenge the hundreds of thousands of compatriots, or to capture the arrogant and fierce generals in Qin and present them. He who knows the times is a great man. A true man should not live in this world without taking advantage of opportunities and acting righteously and for profit. Do a successful about-face and become famous! (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)

### Japanese Economic Encroachment on China

Plan to Use Gengzi Indemnity Surplus Funds to Invest in the Development of Roads and Mines in North China

[Tokyo] The Japanese government held an extraordinary cabinet meeting on the 18th and decided that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would submit a revised legal bill on the special accounting law for cultural undertakings in China to the parliament. The purpose of the revision is to expand the scope of use of the special accounting reserve for cultural undertakings in China in order to invest capital in railways and other economic construction in North China. The scope of use of the existing 36 million yuan in the special accounting reserve for cultural undertakings in China, which comes from the Gengzi Indemnity, is limited to purchasing public prices or depositing funds in the Ministry of Savings. However, the most recent interest rate reduction has caused various inconveniences. Therefore, the purpose of removing these inconveniences is to invest in profitable and reliable undertakings or bonds, regardless of their type. The method of use will be formally decided by the Committee on Cultural Undertakings in China. However, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' policy, the first method of investment will be to purchase the Treasury bonds of the Chinese Shantung Railway, which are currently held by the Ministry of Finance, for 25 million yuan, in order to promote the future development of economic cooperation in North China centered on the railway. Also, if necessary, the remaining 11 million yuan of the reserve funds will be invested in railways, mines, and other undertakings. If this revised legal bill is passed by parliament and the investment plan can be realized, then the Jinshi Railway, which cannot be started due to lack of capital, can be started, and the Longyan Iron Mine can also be developed, which will be very beneficial for economic cooperation between China and Japan in North China.

Commentary

### Lessons from the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Express Accident

— Dou

Recently, the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway express train, en route from Hong Kong to the province, suddenly caught fire near Shilong. Three passenger cars were completely destroyed, resulting in over a hundred casualties. This is truly a major misfortune for railway travel and a tragedy rarely seen in recent times. Since the disaster occurred, it has caused a stir far and wide. Some mourn the irreparable loss of life, while others groan in pain from the torment of injuries. The image of grief is self-evident. Even those who did not directly experience the calamity are unable to remain indifferent to this sudden disaster, based on the principle of human mutual assistance and the response of heartfelt sympathy. For the sake of learning from the past and preventing future occurrences, we are eager to have a thorough discussion to draw attention from all parties. Presuming to express our views, we dare not refrain from speaking frankly.

The train is a convenient tool for shortening time and space and is a necessary pursuit for us. In today's world of frequent human interaction, its usefulness is increasingly appreciated. While the convenience it provides is great, the inherent risks it carries are also numerous. These range from minor incidents like running over people to major ones like derailments and capsizing. There is also the possibility of sudden occurrences like bandit attacks or collisions between trains. According to statistics from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau, there were as many as 320 deaths and injuries in train accidents in the 24th year [of the Republic]. Furthermore, looking at train accidents within the past year alone, there have been incidents such as the axle shearing of a freight train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the derailment of a freight train on the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway, collisions between locomotives, collisions between two trains on the Longhai Railway, the derailment of a troop train on the Datong-Puzhou Railway, and the negligence of freight trains. In particular, the train collision cases on the Tianjin-Pukou and Guangdong-Hankou Railways caused a great sensation. In Germany, in 1889, there was one accidental death out of 11 million passengers nationwide. From 1930 to 1932, a total of 15 million passengers were carried, with only three deaths. Furthermore, the emergence of other relief methods is sufficient to curb all difficulties. Germany is a scientifically advanced country, and its rapid progress is truly incomparable to that of our country. However, this proves that the safety of railway transportation ultimately depends on human effort. This is something we should deeply consider and strive to improve.

Regarding the issue of train safety, the Ministry of Railways has long issued orders to all railways to pay attention. The equipment of the train, the examination of employees, and the investigation of duties are all included in the list of concerns. According to reports, the recent Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway tragedy originated from the explosion of chemical products in the washroom, and the train was not equipped with an alarm system, making it impossible to warn the driver in time. This allowed the fire to spread and become unstoppable. If there had been a thorough inspection beforehand, the chemical products would not have been allowed to be placed carelessly in the washroom. If the train had comprehensive equipment, the train could have been stopped for firefighting, preventing passengers from being affected. It must be understood that negligence is not comparable to a train collision. Rescue efforts can be exhausted. How could such serious consequences as the tragic death of 77 people and the burns of 35 people be brought about? The disaster of repeating the same mistake can no longer be undone in the past. The plan to fix the sheepfold should be alerted in the future. How to strive for the training of personnel is the responsibility of the authorities to earnestly plan its rectification.

### British and German Ambassadors to Italy Return Home on Important Missions

Studying the Italian-German Plan for Spain. Solving European problems by excluding Russia.

[Rome] Important diplomatic actions are now underway in secret. The British Ambassador to Italy, Drummond, and the German Ambassador to Italy, Hassel, departed separately for London and Berlin, carrying a plan agreed upon by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Aviation Minister Göring to resolve the Spanish question. Future developments are noteworthy. (National Telegram, 19th)

[Paris] Mrs. Tabouis, a diplomatic correspondent for L'Œuvre, recently published an article on the talks between Germany and Italy and the Spanish Civil War. The article stated, "During their meeting in Rome, German Aviation Minister General Göring and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini drafted a plan proposing that Britain, Germany, and Italy hold talks, and that the Spanish Civil War be discussed first. Then, the issues of security guarantees, the redistribution of raw materials and colonies, and financial and economic issues would be brought up for discussion in sequence. If Britain expresses its agreement, France should be invited to participate in the talks. Once France accepts, Poland should be invited to join as well. However, under no circumstances should the Soviet Union be included. It is expected that British Ambassador to Italy Sir Drummond will submit an informal report to the British government in the coming days." Mrs. Tabouis also stated that, regarding the Spanish question, certain quarters in Britain urgently hope that Britain, Germany, and Italy will issue a joint declaration stating that only a government composed of moderates in Spain can be recognized by these countries. If so, other countries could join Britain, Germany, and Italy in formulating a procedure for pacifying the situation in Spain, and then convene an international conference to implement this plan.

### Results of Italian-German Talks as Reported by the German Press

A united front established in spirit. The two countries' diplomacy will advance side by side.

[Berlin] The Hamburger Fremdenblatt recently published an article on the talks between German Aviation Minister General Göring and the Italian authorities. The article, which was clearly inspired by semi-official sources, stated in part: "As a result of the talks between the two heads of state, a united front has been established in spirit. It is certainly true that Göring's trip to Italy was of a private nature. However, it can be asserted that his trip has brought the diplomatic policies of Italy and Germany into alignment, and has laid the foundation for this alignment in spirit. As Italian Prime Minister Mussolini stated to a reporter from the Deutsche Nationalzeitung on the 16th of this month, 'Since we know that Bolshevism is the only danger threatening our culture and life, we cannot help but feel that the European countries have a need to unite to deal with it.' This shows that the German National Socialist Party's accusations against the Soviet Union at the Nuremberg Congress in September of last year were well-received by the Italian authorities. Italy and Germany, seeing that communism threatens to attack European countries from a starting point in Spain, are therefore approaching each other in a friendly spirit. As for Britain, the axis formed by Italy and Germany does not conflict with the British-Italian Mediterranean Agreement. Although Britain is currently continuing to recognize the Valencia government in Spain, it must be considered that if a Soviet republic is established in Spain, or if the Catalan Autonomous Region becomes a red republic, Italy will never be able to compromise."

### 250,000 Dead in the Spanish Civil War

Over 70,000 Foreign Soldiers Fighting. Italian Ship Seized, French Ship Nearly Bombed.

[Paris] Le Juste Observateur estimated today that the Spanish Civil War has lasted 26 weeks. In the first six months, at least 250,000 people have died, and property losses are nearly half of the national wealth. The entire national agricultural, industrial, and commercial sector sacrifices approximately 100,000 pesetas per week due to the civil war. To date, approximately 1,200 French citizens have died on the Spanish battlefield. The number of Russians, Germans, and Italians killed is also equal. (National Telegram, 18th)

[London] According to recent estimates here, there are currently over 40,000 foreign soldiers participating in the Spanish Civil War on the government side, and approximately 32,000 on the Nationalist side. There are fewer than 1,000 Russians, almost all of whom are technicians. The exact number of French volunteers in Spain is not yet known, but rumors suggest as many as 20,000. The remaining foreign nationals assisting the Spanish government in the war include Germans and Italians dissatisfied with their own countries' politics, and there are also approximately 1,000 British citizens, most of whom have not received military training. There are a total of 12,000 Germans and 20,000 Italians among the volunteers in the Nationalist army, most of whom have received training. (Reuters Telegram, 18th)

### Monitoring the Shipment of Military Supplies to Spain

Spanish Government and Rebels Submit Replies to Britain Separately

[London] Today, both the Spanish government and the Nationalist forces have replied to the British government's plan, proposed by the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War, to monitor the shipment of military supplies into Spain. The Spanish government does not object to the principle of monitoring but states that the plan does not provide for complete monitoring of the ports controlled by the rebels. The Nationalist forces' reply indicates that the plan is unacceptable, and claims that thousands of French volunteers are currently crossing the border into Spanish territory. The Non-Intervention Committee is now considering a new plan, which is expected to include the issues of volunteers and war materials. The new plan, unlike the current proposal, will not require acceptance by both sides to be implemented. (Reuters, 19th)

### Catalonia Economic Plan

Dealing with Property, Suspending Rent Payments

Barcelona: The Finance Minister of the Autonomous Government of Catalonia, Mr. Dai Laital, has recently drafted a large-scale economic recovery plan, which proposes the following: ⑴ Establishment of a "Responsibility Committee" which, when deemed appropriate, can seize, requisition, or confiscate people's property.

Those around the President also said that he is very optimistic about the future of the war. (Havas, 19th)

### Nazi Party Activities in Hungary

Propagating Anti-Soviet and Anti-Czech Sentiments

Hungarian Capital: The propaganda machine of the German Nazi Party has recently intensified its activities within Hungary, fiercely attacking the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia without reservation. The Nazi Party has also printed a large number of leaflets in Hamburg, Germany, which are being distributed throughout Hungary by Hungarian landowners and agents of the Nazi Party's correspondence newspaper. The newspaper "Hungarian News," a publication of the new German faction, published an editorial stating, "We must purify national thought so that it is not misled by the works of Lewis, Wells, Thomasson (these three are famous independent writers from England, America, and Germany). Therefore, some enthusiastic young people have volunteered to distribute leaflets in various places in order to correct customs." The "People's News" published a speech by Mussolini, stating, "Democratic thought is sufficient to create the core of the Bolshevik Party. Therefore, all works of liberalism and democracy must be eliminated." (Havas, 19th)

### French Authorities Rushing to Produce Gas Masks

### Roosevelt to Be Inaugurated Today for Another Term as President

To Announce Future Policy Directions, Broadcast Worldwide by Radio

[Washington] Of the 30 million people preparing to attend President Roosevelt's inauguration ceremony on Wednesday, thousands have already arrived in Washington in the rain. Hotel room rates in the capital are expensive, with single rooms now costing at least $10 per night, but those who have come are happy to pay the price and do not mind. The grandstand in Congress Square, which can accommodate 50,000 people, has been completed. President Roosevelt will be sworn in on the steps of Congress and will deliver a speech announcing the major policy directions for the next four years. The speech will be broadcast worldwide by radio.

Like President Roosevelt, Jackson was elected for consecutive terms. A viewing box with glass surrounds has been set up in front of the stand. President Roosevelt will receive salutes from tens of thousands of Marines and Navy personnel. Their parade past the stand will take three hours to complete. (Reuters, 18th)

### British Parliament Reconvenes with Many Bills

Preparing to Build Large Warships

[London] Parliament reconvened today after the Christmas recess with many bills to consider. After the meeting began, the Colonial Secretary, Malcolm MacDonald, first reported on his recent talks with the head of the government of the Irish Free State, Eamon de Valera. It is said that the two sides agreed that the trade agreement signed between Britain and the Irish Free State at the beginning of last year would remain in effect. The result of this conversation was that no formal negotiations were conducted. It is expected that this meeting will take a great deal of time to consider all financial needs. Naval experts believe that in addition to building several small warships this year, three new battleships and seven cruisers will also be built. Parliament will also discuss expanding the air force budget and improving the army's treatment and expenses in order to encourage people to enlist. Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain will propose issuing national defense bonds to fund the purchase of new military equipment, but maintaining national defense spending will come from national taxes, so raising the income tax to five shillings is unavoidable. Parliament will also set civil list expenses for the royal family. Each time a new monarch ascends the throne, this will be enacted. In addition, there is also a special area bill to expand the powers of police officers, as well as a bill to encourage the construction of new industries in distressed areas. This issue will be comprehensively planned in response to the demands of Conservative MPs. At the last meeting, the Conservative Party criticized the current method, which caused public alarm. It is the general opinion that the government still enjoys its former prestige in Parliament. (Reuters, 19th)

### British Secretary of War Said to Be Resigning

Due to Failure to Meet Enlistment Quotas

[London] Parliamentary sources believe that the Secretary of War, Duff Cooper, may resign in the shortest possible time because he has failed to meet the quota for recruiting new soldiers. It is said that during the constitutional dispute caused by King Edward VIII's marriage, Duff Cooper's stance of vigorously supporting the King went against the Prime Minister Baldwin's wishes, and his position was once shaken. (Havas, 19th)

[London] The Secretary of War, Duff Cooper, recently gave a speech at a banquet at the Constitutional Club, stating, "The government has no intention of implementing mandatory conscription in peacetime because we do not need a large standing army to defend our territory. What we need is only a small number of specialized troops sufficient for the defense of the Empire." (Havas, 18th)

### British Secretary of Commerce Counters US Remarks

Redistribution of Colonies Not Welcomed by Britain

[New York] The British Secretary of Commerce, Runciman, arrived here from his country today and stated to the press, "The policy pursued by Britain is to ensure the security of all countries in the world. We will never use commercial bribery towards aggressor nations in order to achieve appeasement in the economic field." When reporters asked what was meant by "aggressor nations," he declined to elaborate but stated, "Even if Germany's former colonies were restored to it, it would never open a new era of prosperity for its economy." As for resolving general European problems by redistributing colonies, this is also not welcomed by Britain. His conclusion was, "We will never give commercial benefits to any country as a bribe to avoid making trouble for us." Runciman also stated that he was not carrying any mission on this trip. The above remarks were made only in his capacity as a member of the British Parliament and a member of the Cabinet on leave. (Havas, 18th)

[San Francisco] The leader of the International Longshoremen's Association today rejected the conditions offered by management to resolve the labor dispute and proposed an alternative plan, requesting the renewal of the arbitration agreement established after the 1934 strike, but with the following three revisions: ⑴ Wages increased from 95 cents per hour to one dollar. ⑵ Increase wages for "checkers." ⑶ Prioritize the hiring of union members. If the management accepts, the union will seek the opinions of its members. The management immediately held a meeting to discuss the case and then announced that it could not accept it. As a result, the Pacific Coast labor dispute has again reached an impasse. (National Press, 18th)

### League of Nations Administrative Council to Hold Regular Meeting Tomorrow

Gu Weijun Assumes the Chairmanship, Feels Great Responsibility

[Paris] The League of Nations Administrative Council is scheduled to hold a regular meeting on the 21st of this month. The position of chairman is rotated according to the first letter of the names of the member states. This year, it should be assumed by the Chinese representative, Ambassador to France Gu Weijun. Gu Weijun departed from here for Geneva this afternoon. Before leaving, he issued a statement to the Havas News Agency, stating, "I am very honored to be the Chairman of the Administrative Council this time, and the responsibility is extremely important, for two reasons. The topics to be discussed at this regular meeting of the Administrative Council include the issue of the Free City of Danzig, the issue of the Turkish minorities in the cities of Syria and Antioch, and the issue of refugee relief in the Spanish Civil War, all of which are very important. This is the first reason. Many great politicians from various countries will attend this meeting, such as French Foreign Minister Delbos, British Foreign Secretary Eden, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler, Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü Aras, Polish Foreign Minister Beck, etc. This is the second reason. Although the various issues raised at this Administrative Council meeting are not directly related to China, I am very honored to be the chairman, both for the country I represent and for myself. As far as the cause of the League of Nations is concerned, although it has experienced difficulties that are disappointing, we should still maintain our inherent belief in the League of Nations in principle. All the great achievements of human civilization cannot be achieved overnight, but often require great hardships and setbacks before the final victory is achieved. The League of Nations is the same. Moreover, the Chinese people are concerned about all attempts to save peace in Europe. If war unfortunately breaks out in Europe, it will inevitably cause a reaction in the Far East immediately, especially given the current situation in China." (Havas, 18th)

Mexico City: Mexico joined the League of Nations on September 8, 1931. In 1932, it notified its withdrawal due to financial difficulties, but then withdrew the notification and remained a member state. Now that the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting is approaching, in order to show its loyalty to the League of Nations, the Mexican government is about to appoint Mr. Castillo, the former envoy to the Dominican Republic, as a special plenipotentiary representative to the League of Nations.

### New York Silver Market Leaders Advocate Repealing the Silver Purchase Act

Members of Congress Rise Up in Opposition

[Washington] The New York silver market leader, Handy & Harman Company, published a silver review suggesting that the United States repeal the Silver Purchase Act of 1934. Members of Congress rose up in opposition today. Nevada Congressman Scrugham said that this is the private prejudice of silver merchants. Utah Congressman Murdock also said that the Silver Purchase Act is part of the US monetary policy. If it has not been successful, it is due to the Treasury Department's poor implementation. Congressman Robinson of that state also said that members of Congress from the western states will unanimously oppose the repeal of the law because the price of silver has increased as a result, which has greatly benefited the western states.

[Tokyo] The Tokyo Military Court has recently thoroughly investigated those with indirect and background relations to the February 26th Incident and is currently deliberating carefully. According to the Army Ministry at 1:58 PM on the 19th, the currently serving officers and some civilians who have been convicted in the case are announced as follows:

Lieutenant Colonel Masui Sokichi sentenced to three years of imprisonment, Captain Suganami Saburo five years, Captains Okura Eiichi and Suematsu Taihei each four years, Lieutenant Shimura Rikujo three years, Lieutenant Shiki Takato one year and six months, Reserve Army Major General Saito Liu sentenced to five years. The above persons were sentenced for the crime of using rebellion in accordance with Articles 30 and 29 of the Army Criminal Code.

Reserve Army Infantry Second Lieutenant Koshimura Sutejiro sentenced to two years of imprisonment, Fukui Ko and Machida Senzo each three years, Miyamoto Masamoto one year and six months, Kato Harumi two years (suspended for four years), Miyamoto Seizo and Sugita Shogo each one and a half years.

The above persons were sentenced for the crime of rebellion in accordance with Article 25, Paragraph 2 of the Army Criminal Code and Article 65, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. In addition, two persons were fined for violating the Publication Law. Thirteen persons were acquitted.

Summary of the Facts of the Crime

⑴ Masui Sokichi: After graduating from the Army University in November of the 13th year of Taisho (1924), while serving in the central part of the Army, he came into contact with young reformist officers. He originally opposed direct action, but believed that the current situation could not be changed by legal means, and direct action would inevitably occur in the military or civilian sectors. At that time, he would also step forward to engage in it. When the Aizawa Incident occurred in August of the 10th year of Showa (1935), he attacked so-called privileged classes such as senior statesmen and zaibatsu, praised Colonel Aizawa's actions, and dared to engage in extreme debates, promoting the so-called Meiji Restoration. When the February 26th Incident broke out, Lieutenant Colonel Masui was quite surprised when rebellious generals such as Muranaka Koji occupied key locations in the capital, believing that there was no other way but to resolve the situation satisfactorily. At 3:00 PM on February 26th, he personally went to the residence of the Minister of the Army to meet with Muranaka and others, listened to their hopes and opinions, and conveyed them to the military officers. At 9:00 PM that day, he asked the military councilors who had gathered at the official residence to accommodate the hopes of the rebellious generals and deal with their troops to a certain extent, rather than simply suppressing them, and strongly advocated that they should be handled well. Furthermore, under the plan to organize a strong reformist cabinet the next day, he made requests and wrote proposals to the martial law staff. On the 28th, upon hearing the rebel army's declaration that they would continue to maintain the occupied areas until the restoration was realized, he conveyed the intentions of the rebel army to some of the military councilors and the vice chief of staff and the vice minister of the army, and expressed sympathy for the handling of the rebels in order to resolve the situation, explaining his specific policies. In essence, he wanted to provide the rebels with military benefits.

⑵ Suganami Saburo: When Muranaka and others were investigated on suspicion of conspiracy in November of the 9th year of Showa (1934), he immediately gathered his comrades to discuss countermeasures. When the Aizawa Incident occurred, he also conspired with his comrades in the public trial to carry out their long-cherished ambition and tried to collect campaign funds, giving Muranaka and others several thousand yuan to use for promotional campaigns. When the February 26th Incident broke out, he was determined to put the rebel army in an advantageous position. On the 29th, Lieutenant Shiki of the 13th Kumamoto Regiment went to Kagoshima at his behest to discuss how to respond with friends and persuaded his comrades to resolve to carry out their plans, giving him 45 yuan in travel expenses to return to Kumamoto to benefit the rebellion. Therefore, he should be considered as writing about and giving military benefits.

⑶ Saito Ryu: After being demoted to the reserve force in March of the 5th year of Showa (1930), he served as a director of the Meirin Association. On February 20th of the 11th year of Showa (1936), Kurihara told him that direct action would begin soon, resolving to carry out the Showa Restoration and asked him to raise funds. He then intended to help the rebel actions of the military personnel and urgently tried to raise funds, giving Kurihara 1,000 yuan in cash on the 21st to serve as funds for the rebellion. On the morning of the 26th, Kurihara asked him to come forward, negotiate with the higher authorities, and work hard to resolve the situation. He then put on his military uniform and went to the Prime Minister's residence to express his condolences to the rebels. He also went to the residence of the Minister of the Army to ask the Minister of the Army to respect the claims of the young officers and find a way to handle the situation well. He also told the Vice Minister of the Army of the resolution of the officers, requesting that he find a way to handle the situation well. He was a supporter of the rebels' claims, etc. (Domei News, 19th)

### Bukharin Dismissed from Government Newspaper in Russia

Suspected of Counter-Revolutionary Case

[Moscow] It was officially announced today that Bukharin has been dismissed from his position as editor of the Soviet Russian Central Executive Committee's mouthpiece newspaper. It is heard that Mr. Bukharin's downfall is due to the fact that last August someone attempted to implicate him in the conspiracy to assassinate Stalin. Although the authorities investigated and proved his innocence, the suspicion could not be completely dispelled. As to whether Bukharin will be interrogated with Mr. Radek, the former editor of Pravda, it is not yet known. It is reported that when Zinoviev, Kamenev, and other fourteen counter-revolutionary leaders were tried last summer, the names of Bukharin and Radek were mentioned repeatedly. (Reuters, 19th)

### Reorganization of the Hubei Provincial Government Established, Huang Shaohong and Others Sworn into Office

Mr. Huang Published Five Guidelines for Governing Hubei

Hankou Communication: The new Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, Huang Shaohong, arrived in Hubei on the 15th. At 10:00 AM on the 16th, he held a swearing-in ceremony with Meng Guangpeng, Director of Civil Affairs; Jia Shiyi, Director of Finance; Wu Ting𩗺, Director of Construction; Zhou Tianfang, Director of Education; Lu Zhu, Committee Member and Secretary-General; Yang Kuiyi, Committee Member; and Wu Guozhen. Only Committee Member Fan Xiji was unable to attend because he was supervising work on the remote embankment. He Chengjun was sent by the Central Party Department of the Executive Yuan to supervise the oath in advance. Chairman He presented the seal and delivered a speech. Peng Guojun, Special Commissioner of the Provincial Party Department, Gao Yihan, Supervisor of Hunan and Hubei, Wang Xinggong, President of Wuhan University, and gentry Fang Benren delivered speeches one after another. Mr. Huang replied with a speech, outlining five points for his administrative policy: First, I personally believe that the political tasks undertaken are equivalent to the tasks undertaken on the battlefield. Taking office today is the same as going to the battlefield. We must first have the greatest determination, because Hubei is located in a crucial area. If there is no sufficient determination, it will be difficult to seek its governance. What is determination? It is to be loyal to one's duties. Second, we plan to pay attention to promoting national defense education in the future. At present, the country attaches great importance to education, but local public education still lacks practical results. Therefore, the current task should be to make the general public aware of the dangers of the country's situation, cultivate a clear national concept and a strong fighting consciousness, be able to understand things, distinguish right from wrong, and be able to fight against all unrealistic theories and evil forces. In this way, we can save ourselves and seek the eternal survival of the country and the nation. Hubei's education in the future will require it to be in line with the current extraordinary era. In other words, it is necessary to implement national defense education during extraordinary times, so that the people of the province have national defense thinking and national defense knowledge to cope with all current crises. Third, there is the issue of public security. The promotion of all political plans is based on local stability as a prerequisite. If public security is poor, all political construction is empty talk. When it comes to public security, of course the army bears the most direct responsibility. At present, the army responsible for local public security includes the national army and the security team. However, the national army is not stationed in a fixed area, nor does it have a fixed time, and it is frequently transferred. Therefore, the army that actually bears the responsibility for local public security is still the security team of each province. There are as many as 18 security teams in Hubei, and the annual military expenditure is more than 4 million yuan. With such a large army and huge amount of money, if it still cannot bear the responsibility for public security in the entire province of Hubei, it is a shame for the Hubei security team. Therefore, in the future, the public security of Hubei will be hoped to be borne by the Hubei security team. At the same time, in order to enable it to bear this responsibility, the Hubei security team will be given a necessary reorganization. Fourth, there is the issue of water conservancy in Hubei. The floods in Hubei have caused great harm. Almost more than half of the counties in the province are prone to floods. Hubei has been suffering from droughts and banditry for many years, almost all of which stem from floods. Therefore, the issue of water control is an urgent task for Hubei's future administration. Fifth, there is the issue of finance. The financial foundation of Hubei is not very stable. Most of the province's budget relies on subsidies from the central government. The central government's subsidies are based on special tax revenues, which are very unsound. Finance is the foundation for political advancement, so reorganizing finance is the most important thing. However, when it comes to reorganizing Hubei's finances, it is necessary to first reorganize the province's land tax. Hubei has a vast area, and the existing land tax burden is extremely light. This does not mean that land tax should be increased, but that land tax that is not taxed should be reorganized. If the above-mentioned important policies are not fully implemented, then everything else will be out of the question. Of course, we must concentrate all our efforts to implement national economic construction in the future. The economy is the center of modern politics. Hubei, where the countryside is declining, especially needs to be rescued by economic construction. For example, the promotion of agriculture, the improvement of cooperative undertakings, and the improvement of rural finance all need to be implemented step by step. Today, I will just briefly report my personal determination and the direction of future administration to Supervisor He and all the guests. I hope you will give as much guidance and help as possible, and I hope that all colleagues will do their best in accordance with this policy, and I hope that the people of the province will supervise and encourage them from the sidelines. After the speech, the ceremony was announced to be over. (January 16)

### Lianghuai Salt Transport Office Rectifies Salt Affairs on the Anhui and Henan Shores

Regulating Production and Sales, Planning Supply, Cracking Down on Infringement of Sales, Maintaining Tax Revenue

Bengbu Communication: The Anhui and Henan shores are the largest sales shores for Huai salt outside the Yangtze River shores, with annual sales of more than 1.6 million dan and tax revenue of no less than 10 million yuan. The area covers 21 counties in northern Anhui and 16 counties in eastern and southern Henan. The tax procedures are as follows: the regular tax is collected on-site by the Lianghuai Salt Affairs Inspection Office, and the surtax is collected locally by the Bengbu, Xiba, Sanhejian, and Zhumadian tax offices. The agency responsible for salt affairs administration is the Lianghuai Salt Transport Office. The agency responsible for inspection, tax collection, weighing, and release is the Lianghuai Salt Affairs Inspection Office. In recent years, in order to unify authority and improve efficiency, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Lianghuai Salt Transport Envoy to also serve as the manager of the Salt Affairs Inspection Office to comprehensively manage administrative tax collection affairs. Here is a record of its rectification of salt affairs:

Old Counties on the Shores, Added Counties

The Anhui and Henan shores are the Huai salt administrative transportation and sales area mixed between northern Anhui, eastern Henan, and southern Henan. Northern Anhui originally had 19 counties. Due to changes in county governance, the sales shores are roughly the same, but the number of counties has increased accordingly. Although Yingshan has been劃歸划歸管轄，仍然劃歸管轄，仍然皖豫岸內，原來仍然仍然個縣，為盯貽定遠個縣，為盯貽定遠貽個縣，為盯貽定遠個縣，為盯貽定遠個縣，為盯貽定遠個縣，為盯貽定遠個縣，為盯貽定遠個縣，為盯貽定遠個縣，為盯貽定遠五河泗縣，靈璧靈璧，鳳陽，鳳陽，懷遠，蒙城，渦陽，毫縣，鳳台，壽縣縣，潁上，阜陽，太和，霍邱，霍邱霍邱霍山山山山山，嗣添新設之嘉山，嗣添新設之嘉山山，嗣添新設之嘉山，嗣添新設之嘉山山山山山山，計二十一縣，豫境添設經扶縣，加之原來固始，商城，潢川，光山，息縣，羅山，信陽，信陽，新蔡，上蔡，汝寗，正陽，西平，遂平，確山十四縣，計十五縣，皖豫岸全岸共計三十七縣，均為自由販運區域。

Regulating Supply and Demand, Recruiting Merchants to Transport Salt

Huai north originally for salt production area. In recent years production increased day by day. Each field accumulated. Anhui and Henan shore thirty-seven counties, in recent years due to social and economic increasingly decline. People salt buying ability to compare difference. Therefore sales sluggish. Supply over demand. Gradually taxed heart tax reduce influence national treasury greatly minister. Lianghuai salt transport makes concurrently Lianghuai salt affairs inspection office manager Yao Yuanlun, have see and this. Special in planning Huai salt Changping storehouse case within. Stipulate each shore adds to transport to store salt and pay tax method. Merchants enlist amount undertake do. As for adjust supply and demand plan. Report by Ministry of Finance approved. Anhui and Henan shore also in its row. Anhui north and Henan Ru guang such as fifteen counties. One time each adds to transport 400,000 Dan. All is top first pay tax. At first although after transport merchants beautiful show dissent. End with local authorities insist very strength. Situation in will do. And admit transport salt of merchant. Comeback actively pay tax. Successively release transport new salt. New policy then implement unimpeded. As understand Bengbu. Mingguang. Guzhen. Sanbu. Last year already adds to transport ten more million Dan. Henan RugGuang such as fifteen counties merchant place transport new tax salt. Also will near two more million Dan. All is along with system inserts to sell. Not transport then successively release transport.

Improving Transportation, Reducing Freight Rates

Huai salt is sold in Anhui boats, transported from the Salt River to Xiba, and then from Xiba to Wuhe, Lantai, and Bengbu, and then distributed to various counties. However, in autumn and winter when the water is low, it is necessary to go from Xiba to Gaoliangjian. Sailing ships cannot travel, so ox carts or small carts are used to transport them to ships going out of the lake. Therefore, merchants often apply for sea transportation, transported by轮船to Pukou, and then by train to Bengbu. In recent years, salt from the Anhui and Henan shores has mostly been loaded at Dapu or Xinpu, passed through Xuzhou, and then transported to Bengbu, making Bengbu a hub for train-sea-river salt transportation. Those sold in the 15 counties of Henan such as RugGuang are mostly loaded by車at Dapu or Xinpu, transported to Zhengzhou, and then transferred to Zhumadian or Xinyang. Recently, because車transportation costs more, sea transport has been changed to export, arriving at Wusong and entering the Yangtze River, directly to Hankou, and then transferred by車to Xinyang or Zhumadian for unloading, which is more economical. The authorities are now concentrating the salt market after the arrival of車-sea-帆 transport, and are urging merchants to make full use of modern transportation才transportation tools, such as highway汽車 Huaihe small rounds to transport in separate ways, not only the freight rates are reduced, but also the time is saved.

Cracking Down on Infringement of Sales, Maintaining Tax Revenue

The Anhui and Henan shores transport and sell top-quality salt produced in Taiping, Zhongzheng, and Daxinwei in northern Huai, with an annual amount of more than 1.6 million dan, accounting for 30% of the salt released from the four fields in northern Huai. Each dan is taxed with a regular tax (that is, field tax) of 4 yuan, a central surtax of 2 yuan, and a JianTuo fee of 0.1 yuan, which is higher than the tax rate on neighboring shores. Therefore, infringement of sales by neighboring salts is unavoidable, especially in the past year, the infringement of sales by light-tax salts from the six shores of Jiangsu was very serious. The six shores are Huaiyin, Huai'an, Siyang, Su County, Suining, and Pi County, because they belong to the near-field area, so the salt tax rate is lighter, which is the so-called light-tax salt. Since there is infringement of sales, the shore sales are affected, and the tax revenue is also sharply reduced. For example, in the 24th year, the Bengbu Salt Affairs Tax Collection Office collected more than 2.6 million yuan in surtax, while in the 25th year, it only collected more than 2.4 million yuan. The authorities have tried their best to crack down on and prevent the infringement of sales by light-tax salts in order to maintain tax revenue. Last year, the captured illegal salt amounted to 617 dan, all of which were confiscated. After active crackdown, the trend of infringement of sales on the Anhui and Henan shores may be reduced, and the salt sales and taxes in the 26th year are also expected to increase. (18th)

### Wuxi Chamber of Commerce's Views on the Collection of Income Tax

Four Practical Issues Raised, Personnel Sent to Shanghai to Participate in Research

Wuxi Communication: The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in order to study various practical issues in the collection of income tax, sent a letter to chambers of commerce in various places to recommend representatives to hold an income tax research meeting from the 20th to the 25th. In addition to recommending Qian Sunqing, Jiang Zhongliang, and Li Bosen to participate in the meeting in Shanghai, the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce also raised four opinions based on the actual situation: ㊀ The account books used in commerce are mostly old-fashioned bookkeeping, which has long become a habit. If you want to change suddenly, there will inevitably be many difficulties. In recent years, Jiangsu Province has vigorously implemented the accounting system, and all agencies have uniformly switched to new-style bookkeeping, and the printing paper has suddenly increased several times. However, merchants in the interior, especially small and medium-sized ones, seek profits and seek profits. It is difficult to do this with nuclear costs. According to Article 24 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax, the income declarer should submit a property catalog, a profit calculation statement, a balance sheet, or other account books and documents sufficient to prove his income amount at the time of declaration. It is also known that the commercial account books should be listened to according to their habits and should not be changed suddenly, so as not to hinder the progress of tax collection. ㊁ According to Category 3 of Article 1 of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax, the interest income from deposits is similar to the current accounts in merchants. It seems that it should not be directly regarded as a deposit. Merchants' operating capital often waxes and wanes with time. The current accounts are also often in debt, but they are only used for turnover. It is not a loan nature. It is different from fixed deposits, which do have interest income. Now that merchants have to collect business income, the current accounts, even if there is occasional interest, will still be taxed at the same time in the future, and the tax revenue is very small. The current accounts of merchants should not be compared with fixed deposits, and the interest income should be calculated separately, which is double taxation. ㊂ Since the development of banks, floating capital has entered the city, resulting in tighter silver roots and more depression in the interior. The commerce in various parts of Jiangsu Province is related to the Shanghai market. Foreign economic aggression also takes Shanghai as its base camp. If income is suddenly levied in the interior, and the interest income of foreign banks cannot be handled uniformly, merchants' capital will inevitably escape to foreign banks. Although there are strict laws and severe penalties, it is only to drive away the雀. It is proposed that the government should contact all foreign banks to settle the matter. Before it can be handled uniformly, it should not be collected suddenly, so as to leave some room for the national economy. ㊃ According to Article 15 of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax, an examination committee should be established to regulate officials' standards, which is beneficial to tax collection. Now that income tax has been collected, the organizational regulations of the examination committee have not been drafted. If there is any disagreement in the future, what will be decided? The Ministry of Finance should draft organizational regulations to facilitate taxation and should not be treated as a pending case. The above four items have been sent to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for public research yesterday to avoid hindering and facilitating implementation.

### Taicang Teacher Saves Out-of-School Students

In order to promote education and save out-of-school elementary school students, the Provincial Taicang Normal School has specially recruited 20 students for the junior high school remedial class this semester. The expenses of the class are borne by the students themselves, so each semester needs to pay 59 yuan. Other benefits are the same as other students.

### Kunshan Plans to Widen Huanshan Road

The Huanshan Road in this county was built by the Education Bureau in the 23rd year, but it is all dirt road, less than three meters wide. The county government decided to widen and pave the stone road to make it strong, taking advantage of the reputation of Ma'anshan as a scenic spot. Personnel will be sent next month to measure and estimate, and construction will start in March. It is expected that it will be completed in June.

### Sun, Chen, Feng, and Others Said to be Withdrawing from the Port Team

Indicated Unwillingness to Go to Hong Kong and Participate in the Second Trial

The annual Hong Kong-Shanghai Port Football Match has been scheduled to be held in Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year. The Shanghai Westerners Football Club is selecting representatives. The first trial was held last Sunday, and the result was quite unsatisfactory. The second trial has been scheduled for this Sunday (24th). The trial list has been seen in yesterday's newspaper. Of the six Chinese team members selected last time, only half of them got the chance to play. The rest, Jia, Li, and Chen (Zhenxiang), have been abandoned, and the relationship between the club and the Eastern China will become worse. According to the reporter of Guoguang News Agency, Sun, Chen, and Feng have formally expressed their unwillingness to participate in the port team and the second trial. Therefore, the Shanghai Port representative team this year will become an all-Westerner situation. However, with the overall withdrawal of the Chinese team members, the club is even more stretched for personnel allocation, and its strength will be greatly affected. It is also learned that the club has decided that the maximum number of representatives for this local team is 18. It has notified Hong Kong to change it to 17 people in order to save expenses. However, according to the usual practice, one manager should be sent, so some people advocate that Gaxu, the captain who does not attend the game, should also serve as the manager, because Gaxu is very familiar with Hong Kong, and can also serve as a reserve member for the mainstay. In addition to Gaxu, there is really no suitable person for the captaincy in the Shanghai team.

The Exchange Rate of Copper Coins Is Difficult to Recover; The Reason Lies in Buying and Melting Them Down; Investing 1,000 Legal Tender Can Yield a Gross Profit of About 70 Yuan

Recently, the exchange rate of copper coins has shrunk sharply. At first, the general psychology thought that the situation affected the rates but would soon return to normal. Who would have thought that the news is now calm, but the exchange rate of copper coins is still only around 2,900 articles. Although this is due to the year-end relations, there are various major reasons behind the scenes. According to the author's vision, the future is difficult to recover. Since the implementation of legal tender, of course, the old copper coins are recycled, recast, and the new currency is realized. Over time, the old copper coins in the market will inevitably decrease, but the key is not only this. It is because someone is speculating on copper coins and profiting from them. The speculators' procedures are also very simple, but it is more difficult to recruit a principal. Today, times have changed, the form and weight, the psychology of the people, the gradual increase in the price of copper, and the factory's emphasis on raw materials have made a part of the people take speculative measures to gain a small profit. Accumulating less makes more, and the surplus is also considerable, and the exchange rate of copper coins is difficult to recover because of this. Now, let me state one of the speculative methods as follows:

Try to exchange for 2,900 articles of copper coins from the smoke exchange industry with one yuan of legal currency. The types of copper coins are very complicated, but only two types can be distinguished by quality: thick and thin. According to the current situation, the ratio of thick purple copper coins to thin copper coins is about 7 to 3. Suppose someone exchanges 1,000 yuan of legal currency for 29 million articles of copper coins (including 30% thin copper coins) and takes out the thin copper coins, which is about 8.7 million articles, and then exchanges them for thick purple copper coins (about a discount loss of one cent per legal tender, which generally requires about four exchanges to complete), then the loss of legal tender is 5 yuan, 6 jiao, and 2.5 fen. The cost is 1,005 yuan, 6 jiao, and 2.5 fen. However, the previous 8.7 million articles of thin copper coins have now been exchanged for thick copper coins. The ratio of the weight of thin copper coins to thick copper coins is about 80%. Then the weight of the 8.7 million articles of thick copper coins is equal to 10.875 million articles. Plus the original 20.3 million articles of thick copper coins, it is equal to 31.175 million articles. The ordinary copper factory's purchase price is about 3 jiao and 4.5 fen per thousand articles of copper coins (the market price of one yuan of legal tender exchanges for 2,900 articles of copper coins). Then the copper coins of this person are 31.179 million articles, and selling them to the copper factory can get 1,075 yuan and 5 jiao of legal tender, minus the principal of 1,005 yuan and 6 jiao and a half, and a gross profit of about 70,000 yuan can be obtained. This is just a general situation, and the speculators' means and methods can make people unpredictable.

### Securities

Spot Goods Cashed Out Recently; Public Bonds Continue Downward Trend

Yesterday, the trend in the public bond market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange continued to decline. Market sentiment was also quite weak. Both long and short positions were actively engaged in swap transactions. However, due to a certain major player continuing to sell off large quantities of spot goods recently, the supply and demand of chips on the surface was uneven, and market prices tended to fall again. Retail investors were still buying, so the market situation in the afternoon was slightly firmer. At the opening yesterday morning, the market situation was extremely weak. No. 47 on behalf of a certain financial giant specializing in collecting Category C short-term bonds, while selling off Category E, D, and other four types. Retail investors were quite keen to buy, so the market price only rose by five cents for Category C bonds, while the rest fell by one to four dimes. In the second session, No. 47 continued to see large-scale selling of Category E and C bonds, while No. 50 and 72 were eagerly buying.

The comparative table of their rise and fall, high and low, is as follows:

### Yarn and Cotton

Yarn Sales are Stagnant; Trading in Futures Yarn is Especially Lacking

Even Though Grade Three Yarn Has Risen: It Only Brought Up the Market by Several Dimes

The yarn market is mediocre and the atmosphere is stable. As the final accounting period is approaching, yarn sales are stagnant. Customers and brokers have no intention of taking action. Therefore, people's minds are idle, and neither the long nor short positions intend to move. Therefore, transactions are very rare, and market prices lack significant changes. As for the long position, they still do not give up on tightening the February futures. However, a part of them are exclusively selling February futures. The future is difficult to predict. In short, the fundamental problem is actual demand.

Spot Yarn Alone is Small in February Futures; Spot Yarn Pre-Market Opening, Short-Term Sales are High, Long-Term are Ordinary

After the first session, it was heard that Tian Gu Grade One Yarn had risen by four yuan this month. In addition, long-term prices rose by two yuan. Market sentiment turned firm, and floating shorts slightly covered. Market prices rebounded by a few dimes, but the transaction volume in the field was very scarce, and the fluctuation was not large. The results of spot yarn for each month rose by three, four, or five dimes compared with the closing price of the previous day. At the afternoon opening, Grade Three Yarn's telegram said that the price rose again by three or four yuan, and the market atmosphere rose again by several dimes, but the transaction was still lacking. Before long, it was heard that the transaction of spot yarn was less than 500 bales. The market re-entered a state of fatigue. However, Osaka's Grade Three Yarn closed higher again, rising by four yuan to nine yuan six dimes compared with the previous day. The results of spot yarn in March rose by two dimes compared with the morning closing price, and the February and April futures fell by three or five dimes. It was found that 1,100 bales were sold: Ju Yu 750 bales, Zhen Da 610 bales, Da Chang 700 bales, Jin Chang 500 bales, Geng Feng 410 bales, Heng Yi 350 bales, and Fu Kang 350 bales. The purchases were: He Xing 950 bales, Yuan Yi 450 bales, Run Kang 650 bales, Ren Feng 500 bales, Yong Chang 700 bales, and Tong He 800 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices of the day are listed on the left.

Spot Yarn Selling Price Drops by One Yuan; Spot Yarn Sales Market is Quiet

It was found that the total number of bales purchased by various brokers throughout the day was only 438 bales, and the single price dropped by one yuan. The purchase amount of each broker is listed below.

Cotton Market is Almost at a Standstill

The cotton market does not break away from the situation of market makers. The overall trend has nothing to do with honor or disgrace. The market is in a state of scatteredness. The price difference throughout the day is only between one and two dimes, which shows that people's minds are lazy. At the same time, spot cotton transactions are stagnant and factory stomachs are blocked.

Fluctuation Range of Spot Cotton Becomes Narrower; Spot Cotton Pre-Market Opening, Each Month is Flat and Weak, the Market is Unusually Dispersed, and There is Absolutely No Sign of Revival

Although American cotton rose by one or two pounds, Indian cotton fell sharply by two or three rupees. Therefore, people's minds were ordinary, and buying and selling in the market was especially lacking. However, Osaka's Grade Three Cotton rose by three, four, or six dimes. Scattered shorts slightly covered, rebounding by five cents. The results for each month rose by five cents compared with the closing price of the previous day. At the afternoon opening, although the telegram of Grade Three Cotton said that the price rose again, the market was still deserted. There was very little fluctuation after the first session, and the market state felt more dull. The results for near-month contracts fell by one dime compared with the morning closing price, and far-month contracts did not move. It was found that Yu Da sold 3,300 piculs, Feng Tai 2,100 piculs, Tai Chang 1,900 piculs, Yi Chang 1,900 piculs, Run Kang 1,200 piculs, Chang He 2,400 piculs, Ming De 900 piculs, Yuan Da 900 piculs, Geng Feng 900 piculs, and Zhen Da 900 piculs.

Indian Cotton Farmers Continue to Sell Enthusiastically

Yesterday, American cotton opened because Liverpool's telegrams were not good, the automobile strike was unfavorable, longs closed out, and cotton farmers sold off excrement. Each month fell by three to seven pounds. Before the problem of borrowing money for cotton was resolved, merchants mostly took a wait-and-see attitude. Later, there was a need for a large number of colleagues in near-month contracts, but there was still a lack of new accounts. At the same time, there were some swaps, and some bought October futures to offset the sale of September futures of dried oil. The footing of low-grade spot cotton was relatively soft, and the short positions covered when attacking. Colleagues bought at eye prices, and the trend was very firm. It is estimated that spot goods rose by one pound, and futures fell by one pound to rise by two pounds. British cotton spot goods fell by four points, and futures fell by one point. Indian cotton was initially weak due to short positions selling off, and then rebounded due to local factories buying, and finally weakened again due to cotton farmers cashing out. It is estimated that Pingguo fell by 1.5 to 2.5 rupees, Aomula fell by 2 to 2.5 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 1.75 to 2 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 18th).

According to the Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for the 19th was: Bairoxi was 227.5 rupees, Aomula was 204 rupees, and Pingguoer was 179.25 rupees, all rising by 1 rupee.

Hankou Cotton Exports are Quite Smooth

Cloth Transactions Have Turned Stagnant

Hankou Express News: The cotton market in this city is still stable, and there are sources of coarse and fine velvet in the production area. The sales market is strongest for the Shanghai brokers and exporters. Yuhua Yarn Factory and Japanese firms, Nisshin, and Toyo Cotton Foreign Company also purchased, so the paths for all parties are still not stagnant. The total transaction volume converted to city weights is 6,058 piculs, and another 8,000 catties. The selling price has increased by one or two dimes compared with the previous price. Also, since the new year, the customer stomachs of cotton cloth have been fatigued. Besides occasional sporadic transactions in colored and fine cloth, there are very few inquiries for coarse cloth. The price of cloth has fallen by five cents to several dimes per bolt due to the weak price of yarn.

### Grain

Actual Sales are Stagnant; Flour Plummets by Eight or Nine Cents

Yesterday, the flour market opened in the morning, and each month showed a consistent and miserable slump. As for the quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago was slightly better by 48 cents, while Canada fell by about two dimes. After the opening price, the people's minds were still stable because there was still little foreign wheat entering or leaving. However, because this month is close to delivery, actual sales are still stagnant, resulting in floating longs outside the industry, which have been discarded and cannot be discarded, so they have to be gradually sold off. Therefore, people's minds are very weak, and the market is falling sharply, and there is no way to save it. After all, speculation longs and customer transactions are different. One can draw profits, and the other is purely for the purpose of making profits, and did not consider the sales market at the beginning. Until the afternoon opening, the degree of decline in the market became even more violent. The opening price in January and February actually fell by one dime compared to the previous day and stopped. Fortunately, the people's minds in March were more stable and did not reach the limit. Therefore, by the second session, the former abandoners had risen to resist the trap, and the long side gradually prolonged their last gasp, slightly better near the minimum. According to speculation in the industry, it is believed that if actual sales are not active, the market will still be difficult to stand still.

The standard for this month will be auctioned until the 25th, and delivery will be handled from the 26th.

Heavy Snow in the North Road; Wheat Prices Plummet

The Most Violent Long-Term Price Reached One Dime and Seven Cents

Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, each month saw a violent slump. As for the quoted price of foreign wheat, the trend was still difficult to revive. In the near-term, since flour sales were not moving, wheat could not be surprisingly expensive. Those with goods were thinking of selling them. As for the long-term months, due to heavy snow in the north road, there was a sign of a bumper year. Therefore, most people's minds had generally softened. Therefore, after the opening price, transactions in near-term and far-term were very few, and prices fell by five, six, or seven cents. Until the afternoon opening, due to the heavy slump in the flour market, the people's minds outside the industry were also unable to support it, and they sold off one after another. Therefore, the market turned sharply downwards again, and the downward trend was very violent. It is estimated that near-term contracts fell by eight cents, and far-term contracts fell by one dime and four cents to one dime and seven cents. The spot wheat market has stagnated and has not seen any transactions because the factory stomachs have stopped and the standards have plummeted. The standard for this month will be stopped until the 25th, and delivery will be handled from the 26th.

Dalian Soybean Telegram Reports a Fall

Local Bean Prices Become Flat; Foreign Companies' Sesame Still Maintain

Soybeans: Yesterday, under the frequent falls in Dalian, the soybean market situation, people's minds were uniformly softened. Transactions in the market were unusually deserted. Northeastern soybeans and train soybeans were not opened in bags. Only 500 bags of Hankou Zha soybeans, 600 bags of Late soybeans, 250 bags of Jiujiang Winter soybeans, 200 bags of Late soybeans, and 42 bags of Chongming Sand Yellow soybeans were opened. Prices fell by four or five cents.

Sesame: Foreign companies' sesame was handled by the Central Trust Bureau, 750 tons, and the selling price was maintained. The original plate was 15 yuan and one dime and a half. If the subsequent situation is as greedy as handling the stomach, the market may fall.

Guest Yuan Rice Alone Rises by a Dime

Yesterday, the de-hulling of the guest Xian rice was still sluggish, and the market continued to fall. Only Yuan rice from Shantou and this street inquired. There were still nearly 2,000 bags of transactions in the unified market, and the market price saw a step-by-step increase of a dime. Other coarse grain Xian rice all returned to cut by four or five cents to nearly a dime. In fact, because the end-of-year collection is approaching, the guests intend to stop, and Guangdong has recently had contacts with Hunan rice and foreign rice, which is even more of a wait-and-see attitude. Yesterday, in addition to Yuan rice, only Quanzhou took 400 bags, Shantou took 100 bags, and Guangdong brokers took 249 bags. The rest were all handled by this street. The total number of transactions throughout the day was about 3,000 bags.

Hexia Rice is Excellent in the North City

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of more than 30 Dongyuan brokers arrived, with a total of 6,230 stones of goods. The sales market on this street was even more deserted than before, and the bag stomachs were also lax. Only Qingdao brokers handled more than 1,000 bags of Bo Dao, which made it even more difficult for the market to revive. The Bo Dao market was unchanged, but the situation was stable with a soft trend. Hou Geng was still lingering and did not enter the store. The price fell by another five cents. Du Yangjian also dropped by a dime due to the higher price. Yin Yuan also followed down by a few cents.

(Zhabei) Yesterday, there were 34 Hexia sources. The stomachs of the goods in the market were damp and cloudy. The stomachs of the stores were still quite bad. The market shape of Bai Geng was stable. The price of Bo Dao was excellent and the price of Early Dao was also tightened. The prices of Yin Bian Yuan and various Xian rice were not much up or down.

### Piece Goods

Coarse Cloth Market Becomes Active Again

Although the domestic and foreign cotton yarn market situation lacked good signs yesterday, domestic cotton cloth business has been rising and falling. The actual sales momentum in this quiet settlement period is already not weak. Moreover, the price of fine yarn is very firm, and futures are especially high. Printed goods and cloth have lively customer traffic. Recently, various dyeing factories continue to sell short. Colored cloth, seeing that white goods are gradually softening, temporarily adopt a wait-and-see attitude and refuse to resist entering, resulting in increasingly light actual sales of white goods. The market price falls again and again, gradually arousing buying intentions. Currently, factory prices are still firm, but the stock of goods in the market has suddenly become short. Various dyeing factories and cloth shops are rushing to resist replenishment. The market voice is rebounding due to short covering, with each bolt rising by five cents. Transactions are becoming lively. Coarse cloth is also becoming active because spot sales are gradually becoming lively. The Yangtze River brokers and Guangdong brokers search for 11-pound and 13-pound coarse cloth. Mainland brokers and this street search for 9-pound coarse cloth. The Yihe Factory's products in the market are becoming tense again. The factory price for heavy-weight 16-pound goods is very high. Colleagues and military uniform brokers continue to place orders. The four-month futures of 14-pound coarse cloth Hengfeng Factory opened 600 pieces, which is said to be the reason for the military clothing industry. Therefore, the coarse cloth market has become active again. The momentum of printed goods and dyed cloth is also good, and the market price is generally stable.

### North-South Goods

Golden Needle Vegetables Have Activity in Guangdong and Fujian

Golden needle vegetables have recently had activity from Guangdong and Fujian brokers, and market sentiment has turned low.

Overseas Silk Prices Have All Seen a Miserable Fall

—The Shanghai Market Plate is Still Relatively Stable

It is estimated that the special prices of New York Japanese silk at 83 cents and 75 cents and Huasi all fell by five cents. The exchange sold at a price of 8.5 cents for near-term contracts and 6.5 cents for far-term contracts, which is equivalent to a decrease of 33 yuan, 3 dimes and 2 cents per load in the Shanghai market. The Lyon silk market was stagnant and did not move. Yokohama spot goods fell by 33 yuan, and far-term contracts fell by 21 yuan. The Shanghai silk market saw a slight opening yesterday.

African Tea Sales Are Gradually Becoming Active

The sales of African green tea had become stagnant due to the tense relations between Germany and France. In the past two days, the situation has become slightly more active. Yihua, Xiehe, and other firms in this city, as well as Huacha Company, etc., have sent telegrams to sell the remaining Zhenmei green tea on the market due to the low price. And because the end of the general accounting period is approaching, they are paying for the goods that were transacted in the previous two months. It is said that Jinlong, Baolong, and other firms, as well as Caiye Trading Company, will ship more than 3,000 boxes of green tea to Africa this week.

Special Feature

### Wartime Finance

— Xi Dongshu

The expansion of credit, the rise in material prices, and the consumption of public prices are all sufficient to increase the government's burden on wartime finance. It is better to increase taxes in a simple and direct way, because if the government's purchasing power is reduced, the use of human and material resources will be in an unfavorable position. High prices cause farmers to feel extreme pain in their lives. Not to mention, it is better to add taxes than to borrow debt, which has been generally recognized by economists. Some people say that war is not only for the survival of the people of the present day, but also for the benefit of the people of future generations. It is better to give debt first and let future generations share a part of the burden. How do you know that modern warfare is a constant cycle? Future generations may have their burdens. It is impossible to push the burden of modern economy to future generations. Moreover, those who hold public bonds have not made any sacrifices during the war, and they are sitting idly by and eating their profits, which creates an unfair burden on the economy. Public bonds are just a temporary substitute for taxes. The destination of public bonds is ultimately taxes. If debt is raised to pay for war expenses, it must be accompanied by an increase in tax revenue, so that it is sufficient to pay the interest on the public debt and a part of the debt principal, otherwise the government's credit will be shaken, so that public bonds cannot be issued in the future, which is tantamount to shooting oneself in the foot. Therefore, the sound method of planning wartime finance is to increase taxes to a high degree, so that they cannot be increased any more, and use public bonds to meet the urgent needs of the temporary and make up for the insufficient amount, so that the issuance of public bonds is limited to the lowest amount possible within the possible range. When former British Prime Minister Lloyd George submitted a tax increase bill to the National Assembly in November 1914, he stated, "The tax rate should be increased during wartime, and then lowered when peace is restored. This method is easier, because the patriotic hearts of the general public spontaneously arise during the war, and they do not hesitate to sacrifice everything." During the European War, Britain always tried its best to increase taxes to pay for war expenses. The proportion of taxes in its war expenses was the largest compared to all the belligerent countries in Europe. Later, the United States also paid the same attention to taxes. Therefore, it was easy for Britain and the United States to restore their finances and economies to normal after the war. Germany did not increase taxes from the beginning, and completely paid for war expenses with public bonds, hoping to be compensated by the enemy countries after victory. It was not until the third year after the start of the war that it decided to increase taxes. France also leaned towards the path of public bonds. Although it was victorious in the war, the post-war finances were unusually chaotic. It took a long period of consolidation before it entered the right track. Germany need not be mentioned. We have the lessons of the past, and we should make a decision to increase taxes at this time of being prepared for a rainy day, and prepare for the collection of considerable direct taxes. According to the British wartime direct taxes, the war tax was 73 percent. During the American war, direct taxes accounted for 79 percent of the war tax, which shows the importance of the status of direct taxes. At this time, we should quickly set up direct tax institutions, in order to achieve rapid results in the future. Now I will briefly describe the various direct taxes that can be used during wartime.

(1) Income tax. This tax has been implemented in various countries around the world for a long time, and it is indeed the most reasonable tax. Fortunately, the government has decided to adopt it. It is true that the legislator Chen Changheng said (1) The scope of income tax is wide, which is suitable for the principle of tax proliferation. (2) Income tax determines the differential tax amount according to the size of the people's ability to bear, which is suitable for the principle of tax fairness. (3) The income is rich, which is suitable for the principle of tax richness. (4) Income tax is levied based on the people's actual income, which is suitable for the principle of a sure tax. (5) Income tax is flexible, and countries often consider it to be suitable for regulating national revenue and expenditure. Brother pro-tax, for the flexibility of income tax, is extremely important during wartime. During the European War, the highest income tax in Britain was 10 shillings and 6 pence for every 20 shillings. The highest peak of income tax in the United States reached 77 percent. This type of flexible direct tax is most suitable for the needs of finance in extraordinary times. (To be continued)

### Various Circles Telegraph the Central Government to Punish Zhang and Yang

Chinese Seamen and Representatives from Various Organizations: Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, a joint meeting was held in the meeting room of the Special Party Department of the Chinese Seamen. A unanimous resolution was made to telegraph the central government requesting a clear order for punishment. At the same time, a telegram was sent to Yang as a final word of sincere advice. The original telegram is as follows: ⑴ Respectfully to the Nanjing Central Executive Committee: In the recent Xi'an Incident, the Central Government, with a magnanimous heart, originally intended to preserve national strength and give Yu Yang and others a chance to reform themselves. They should have been grateful and repaid the country with loyalty, atoning for their past transgressions. Unexpectedly, their wolfish ambitions remain unrepentant. Recently, they have colluded with the Red bandits to harm the country. Their rebellious actions are evident, and the law is unforgiving. We humbly request a clear order for punishment to curb the chaos and uphold the law. We send this urgent telegram with utmost sincerity, humbly requesting your consideration. Chinese Seamen, Chinese Ships, Wireless Telegraphers Public Welfare Association, Chinese Maritime Navigators Federation, Chinese Marine Engineers Federation, Chinese Customs Wheel Pilots Association, Chinese Yangtze River Pilots Association, Maritime United Righteousness Society, Merchants Ship United Benefit Society, North Jun'an Sailors Association, South Jun'an Sailors Joint Benevolent Society, Yan Ying Nan Society, Yan Ying Tong Xing Society, Maritime Helmsmen Carpenters Mutual Aid Association, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Tallymen's Association, New Taikoo Tallymen's Club, Shan Zheng Trade Association, Jardine Matheson Tallymen's Club, Yan Ying General Society, China Merchants Bureau Jun'an Association, Maritime Safety Travel Association, Outer Port Tallymen Mutual Assistance Association, Little Yangtze River Club, Jardine Matheson Rear Cabin Benefit Society, Sanbei Hongan Mutual Assistance Association, and other twenty-four organizations, respectfully inquire and stamp. ⑵ To Mr. Yang Hucheng of Xi'an and Mr. Yu Xuezhong of Lanzhou, for your consideration: The telegram has been sent. The Central Government's handling of the Shaanxi Incident has been compromising and extremely tolerant. If you truly have a conscience, you should turn over a new leaf, be grateful, and repay the country. However, according to rumors, you have actually colluded with the Red bandits, reorganized the militia, constructed fortifications, requisitioned civilian labor, and actively engaged in war preparations, disregarding the Central Government's orders and the people's sincere advice. This is akin to recklessly challenging danger and heading towards your own demise. We urge you to pull back from the precipice, repent sincerely, and not cause pain to your loved ones and joy to your enemies. We offer this sincere advice once again, hoping for your wise consideration. Chinese Seamen, Chinese Ships, Wireless Telegraphers Public Welfare Association, and other twenty-four organizations, respectfully inquire and stamp.

Both Railway Workers' Unions: In a telegram to the Central Government, they stated: Respectfully to the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Military Council: In our previous telegram, we requested the suppression of rebels and the completion of unification, humbly requesting your consideration. We believe that the Central Government's handling of the special Xi'an Incident was solely aimed at preserving national strength, protecting the soldiers, and showing painstaking consideration and tolerance. Zhang Xueliang, Yang Hucheng, Yu Xuezhong, and others should have been deeply grateful, obeyed orders, reported to the Central Government with gratitude, and thanked the people for their expectations, striving to make achievements to cover up their past mistakes. However, recently, they have shown no remorse. Zhang Xueliang deceitfully conceals his intentions and dares to secretly instigate his subordinates to create disturbances. Yang Hucheng, Yu Xuezhong, and others dare to occupy the Northwest, collude with the Red bandits, and mobilize troops, plotting rebellion. Their rebellious actions are evident and cannot be tolerated. Military and administrative governance must have discipline. Disobeying orders and resisting with arms should be severely punished. Zhang Xueliang's early loss of power and humiliation of the country are already unforgivable. Now that he has intensified his actions, he should be publicly executed as a warning. We send this special telegram to the Council and the Departments, requesting the swift punishment of Zhang Xueliang and a clear order to punish Yang Hucheng and his cohorts, suppressing the rebels and eliminating the bandits. The so-called nurturing should be sufficient to leave a legacy of trouble. A single spark can start a prairie fire. It is impossible to grant further leniency, which would lead to misleading the country and harming the people. We send this urgent telegram in apprehension, humbly requesting your consideration. Railway Workers' Unions directly under the Ministry of Railways, Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) and Huhangyong (Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo) Railways, respectfully stamp.

City Farmers' Association: Together with the district branches, they telegraphed the Central Government, stating: Respectfully to the Nanjing Central Executive Committee, the National Government, and the Military Council: At a time when the soldiers defending the border are bravely fighting the enemy and triumphant news is frequently reported, coinciding with the joyous occasion of victory for the people, unfortunately, the Xi'an Incident occurred. Our Central Government, with a magnanimous heart, and Chairman Chiang's great spirit, continue to make peaceful decisions regarding the aftermath of the Shaanxi Incident, hoping for a change of heart from the misguided. All those with a conscience should repent and serve the Party and the country to atone for their past transgressions. Who knew that Yang Hucheng of Xi'an and Yu Xuezhong of Lanzhou would propagate fallacies, stubbornly resist, disregard the Central Government's policies, treat the nation's destiny and people's lives like worn-out shoes, harbor evil intentions, and undermine unity? Their rebellious actions are already clearly exposed and cannot be tolerated any further, lest they leave future troubles. Therefore, we telegraphically request your Council (Government) to swiftly issue an order for punishment, eliminate the source of the disaster, eradicate the great evil, and restore discipline. We send this urgent telegram with utmost anticipation. Shanghai City Farmers' Association and the Farmers' Associations of South Shanghai, North Shanghai, Gao Hang, Jiangwan, Gaoqiao, Wusong, Fahua, Chan Jing, Pudong, Yangsi, Yangjing, Yinxiang, Yinhang, Pusong, Pengpu, and other districts, respectfully inquire and stamp. (Da Gong She)

City Education Association: The Professors and Writers Association and the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Social Science Society, and other three organizations, urgently telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government yesterday, requesting severe punishment for Zhang Xueliang to uphold discipline and swiftly dispatch troops to punish the rebels Yang and Yu. The text of the telegram is recorded as follows: Respectfully to Chairman Chiang, Vice-Chairman of the Central Party Headquarters, and Chairman Wang of the Central Political Council, and Chairman Lin of the National Government in Nanjing: Since the occurrence of the Xi'an Incident, the people of the whole country have been filled with grief and indignation. Regarding the rebel Zhang Xueliang, everyone believes that even ten thousand deaths are not enough to atone for his crimes. Subsequently, the rebel Zhang respectfully escorted Chairman Chiang back to Nanjing and awaited punishment at the national gate. The people of the whole country generally advocated for public execution to uphold the national law. Considering the rebel Zhang's crimes throughout his life, when he established a feudal separatist regime outside Shanhaiguan, he deserved death; when he failed to resist on September 18th and lost four provinces, he deserved death; this time, he committed a great outrage by detaining the commander-in-chief, deserving death. There are many reasons for him to deserve death. However, our Central Government repeatedly showed tolerance, hoping that he would reform himself. When he established a separatist regime outside Shanhaiguan, he was appeased with an envoy and favored with the position of military and political chief of the Northeast. After losing the Northeast, he was sent to Europe and America to study. Upon his return, he was entrusted with the important task of suppressing bandits in the Northwest. This time, he colluded with the Reds, rebelled, and detained the commander-in-chief. The people of the whole country wanted to eat his flesh and sleep on his skin. However, his sentence was first reduced by ten years and then he was granted a special pardon. The Central Government's treatment of the rebel Zhang can be described as infinitely generous. What reason could there be to oppose such kindness? If the rebel Zhang had the slightest conscience, he should have slit his throat to apologize to the people of the country. How could he still shamelessly live in this world today? Now, the rebel Zhang not only has no remorse but is also plotting and scheming to secretly instigate war. He has instructed Yang and Yu to rebel in the Northwest and coerced the officers and soldiers of the Northeast to obey the Central Government and act in unison, reaching a point of madness beyond redemption. If we show any more leniency, it would be tantamount to fostering evil and tearing our own entrails. Therefore, we request that you, the leaders, make a decisive decision and swiftly execute him publicly as a warning. The rebels Yang and Yu have not appreciated the Central Government's kindness in removing them from their posts but retaining them, and they are willing to be Zhang Xueliang's henchmen, rebelling to the end. We urge you to swiftly dispatch troops to suppress them as soon as possible. Otherwise, they will become a source of trouble, and the flames of the Reds will inevitably reignite in the Northwest, making it impossible to discuss resisting aggression and saving the country. The situation is urgent, and we cannot choose our words carefully. We respectfully request your adoption of our suggestions. The nation and its people will be fortunate. The Shanghai City Education Association, the Shanghai Professors and Writers Association, and the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Social Science Society, respectfully inquire and stamp.

### The Guangxi Inspection Delegation Departed for Hangzhou Yesterday Afternoon

Delegation Leader Zhang Renmin Issues a Written Statement: Expressing Gratitude for the Hospitality and Praising the Efforts to Rebuild

The Guangxi Domestic Inspection Delegation visited various cultural institutions and factories in Shanghai and attended banquets hosted by various circles. Having completed their tasks, they departed by train for Hangzhou at 1:40 PM yesterday. Delegation leader Zhang Renmin issued a written statement before leaving, detailing the situation as follows:

Farewell from All Circles: The delegation attended a banquet hosted by Pang Tianjue, manager of the Hua'an Hequn Life Insurance Company, at 8:30 AM yesterday. Subsequently, at 1:40 PM, they went to the North Railway Station to board the train for Hangzhou. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, representatives Zhou Yongneng and Li Dachao, Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Secretary Wang Zhinan, Chairman Chen Guangfu of the Bankers' Association, representatives Zhou Sizhong, Hu Xiyuan and Wang Zhisheng of the Chinese General Chamber of Industry, and others went to see them off. The Garrison Headquarters also sent a military band to play music at the station. The delegation prepared several gilded copies of "A Glimpse of Guangxi" and distributed them to leaders from various circles in Shanghai.

Future Itinerary: After arriving in Hangzhou, the delegation will stay for three or four days and then proceed to Jiaxing, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, and the capital, to pay respects to the central authorities. In Nanjing, they will wait for the Third Plenary Session to conclude before going to Jinan, Qingdao, Tianjin, Beijing, Taiyuan, and Suiyuan for inspection. Then, they will go to Hankou and return to Guangxi via the Yuehan Railway to Guangdong. The estimated duration is more than two months. China Travel Service has specially assigned Chen Ligang to provide hospitality along the way.

Written Statement: Delegation leader Zhang Renmin issued a written statement on the train, stating that the delegation members were warmly welcomed by the local military and political leaders, business circles, and various sectors during their visit to Shanghai. They were not only treated to lavish banquets but also enlightened. Furthermore, they were grateful to the Chinese General Chamber of Industry for dispatching Mr. Wang Zhisheng to guide them in observing various industrial, commercial, and cultural constructions, which benefited the delegation members immensely. They also felt that the strength of the country and the nation primarily requires the prosperity of the national economy, which can consolidate and perfect all military and national defense. Moreover, the current economic warfare is even more important than military warfare. Fortunately, the people of all circles in Shanghai can support each other and strive to improve. In this extremely depressed situation, they can still work hard and strive for recovery. It is a pity that the time was too short to listen to their teachings thoroughly. Moreover, due to the hurried departure for Hangzhou, they were unable to bid farewell to everyone in person, which they deeply regretted. If there is an opportunity in the future, they will come to Shanghai again for a long discussion.

### The National Medicine and Pharmaceutical Circles Welcomed Director Jiao Yesterday

In the evening, Director Jiao hosted a banquet for the medical, pharmaceutical, and ginseng industries to exchange opinions on the construction of the National Medicine Hall and its funding.

The Shanghai Branch of the National Medicine Hall, the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry Association, the Medicinal Materials Industry Association, the Chinese National Medicine Association, the Shenzhou Medical Association, the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Chinese Medical College, the New China Medical College, and others, jointly organized a general meeting of all members of the national medicine, pharmaceutical, and ginseng circles in the city yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the auditorium of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Yu Qiaqing Road to welcome Mr. Jiao Yitang, Director of the Central National Medicine Hall. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. In the evening, Director Jiao hosted a banquet at the New Asia Hotel for leaders of the national medicine, pharmaceutical, and ginseng circles in Shanghai to exchange opinions on the construction of the National Medicine Hall and its funding. The details are as follows:

Meeting Staff: The presidium of the general meeting consisted of Du Yuesheng, Fang Jiaobo, Mao Zijian, Shen Zhongfang, Gu Weichuan, Shi Jiqun, and Ding Jiwan. Jin Changyuan served as the master of ceremonies, Jiang Yuanfang as the recorder, and Chen Chuxiang, Zhu Hegao, Huang Baozhong, Dong Bowei, Gao Ziwen, Dai Dafu, Shen Xiangpu, He Yunsheng, and Yu Tongfang as the receptionists.

Chairman's Speech: After the formal ceremonies, the chairman, Du Yuesheng Shen Zhongfang, delivered a welcoming speech, briefly stating that Director Jiao of the Central National Medicine Hall has spared no effort in safeguarding our country's medicine and pharmaceuticals. Last year, the government promulgated the Regulations on Traditional Chinese Medicine, giving our country's medicine and pharmaceuticals a legal basis. While drinking water, one should think of its source, which is all thanks to Director Jiao. We, the comrades, are extremely grateful to Director Jiao. Today, in order to make our country's medicine and pharmaceuticals manifest in reality, Director Jiao is building a National Hospital in the capital, with a grand vision and significant results. Due to limited funding, Director Jiao has taken the time to come to Shanghai to discuss with our medical and pharmaceutical circles. I believe that our medical and pharmaceutical circles will actively donate to this grand undertaking to ensure its successful completion. Yuesheng Zhongfang and others are delighted to have the opportunity to listen to his great insights. We have jointly organized this general meeting of representatives from all sectors of the national medicine and pharmaceutical industries in the city to welcome Director Jiao and express our sincere admiration. I respectfully present these few words for your consideration.

Director Jiao's Instructions: Next, Director Jiao delivered instructions, briefly stating that our country's medical and pharmaceutical industry has a long history. In order to preserve the national essence and improve the national medical industry, the Central Government has established the Central National Medicine Hall and plans to establish branches in various regions. The Legislative Yuan has also passed the Regulations on Traditional Chinese Medicine, giving the national medical industry a legal basis. Medicine is a way to protect the health of the nation. The national medical industry is trusted by the majority of our people and has its own indelible advantages. Although it has been attacked by the Western medical community recently, observing the Western medical community, those from Europe, America, and Japan each practice their own techniques and have their own theories. It is questionable whether they can replace traditional Chinese medicine. However, our national medical community should remain calm and not feel discouraged by attacks. We should thoroughly research the national medicine that has been passed down for thousands of years and adopt the strengths of medicine from various countries to supplement the shortcomings of national medicine. There are more than two million practitioners of national medicine throughout the country. If they can unite and study diligently, they will surely achieve great results. Currently, public associations have been organized in various regions of the national medicine and pharmaceutical industries, which is a manifestation of unity. The establishment of schools and national medicine halls also demonstrates the spirit of research in our country's medicine. In the future, we should use scientific methods to improve the national medical industry, and the future of national medicine will definitely be bright.

Mr. Fang's Reply: After Director Jiao delivered his instructions, Mr. Fang Jiaobo gave a reply, briefly stating that Director Jiao's enthusiasm for the national medical industry has allowed the national medical industry to regain its momentum and flourish amidst various slanders, which is deeply appreciated by our medical and pharmaceutical circles. Today, Director Jiao has personally come to provide guidance, and we should follow Director Jiao's teachings, work hard, and express our gratitude. Subsequently, Gong Xingqi, Shang Jianqing, Mao Zijian, and others successively delivered speeches. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM.

Director Jiao's Banquet: Director Jiao hosted a banquet at the New Asia Hotel at 6:00 PM yesterday for leaders of the national medicine, pharmaceutical, and ginseng industries in the city, with dozens of attendees including Shen Zhongfang, Gao Ziwen, Gong Xingzhai, and Ding Jiwan. During the banquet, they exchanged opinions on the fundraising for the construction of the National Medicine Hall. Those invited expressed their willingness to do their utmost to assist in promoting its early completion. Director Jiao had been away from Nanjing for a long time and had important official duties awaiting him in Nanjing, so he returned to Nanjing by train last night.

### The President Wilson Resumes Service as the First Ship to the Far East

The American Sailors' Strike Partially Resolved: Departing from San Francisco on the 23rd

Since the American sailors' strike, all the mail ships and cargo ships of the American China Line of this port, including the Dollar Steamship Lines, the American Mail Line, and the Pacific Steamship Company, have completely ceased service. Since the departure of the Dollar Lines McKinley President, the last ship to arrive in Shanghai on November 13th of last year, more than two months have passed. The huge losses suffered by the various shipping companies are immeasurable. Two weeks ago, a private telegram was received here from the United States stating that the stoker and steward departments of the sailors had reached an agreement with the employers on the terms of resumption of work. However, there was no further news. Until yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, the Dollar Steamship Lines in this port received an urgent telegram from the American head office stating that a part of the sailors' strike had been resolved. The company's President Wilson will be the first ship to resume service to the Pacific and sail back to Shanghai. The ship is scheduled to depart directly from San Francisco this Saturday (the 23rd).

### The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Held a Board Meeting Yesterday

Mr. Zeng Yangfu, Chairman of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday.

### The Spanish Consulate General is Not Listed in the Directory

The Continental Daily reported that the name of the Spanish Consulate General in the 1937 Shanghai Directory was missing, indicating that the Spanish Civil War is still ongoing. The Spanish Consulate General in Shanghai is located at 1449 Avenue Joffre, which is now closed and uninhabited. Consul General Ferreiro resigned several months ago, followed by Vice Consul La Roche Quiaca a few weeks later. The only staff member who has not resigned is Counselor Victoriano Jing Jingshu, who is currently ill and unable to work. According to Spanish expatriates in Shanghai, it is unlikely that the civil war in their country will end in the short term, so the consulate in Shanghai cannot be reopened for the time being. The situation of the Western expatriates in China from various countries is quite difficult due to the lack of diplomatic representation.

### French Concession Chinese Medicine Stores Strike: Declarations of Support from Businesses in Both Districts

Guild Asks for Negotiations and Sends Letters to Various Organizations; Emergency Meeting Held Yesterday to Discuss Response Measures

The Chinese medicine businesses in the French Concession of this city, due to the French Municipal Council cutting off water and electricity and forcibly collecting medicine tax, triggered a strike by all businesses in the area the day before yesterday. There is no hope of resumption of business at this time. In addition to requesting the authorities to negotiate and sending letters to various organizations to explain the truth and request assistance, the Pharmaceutical Industry Association also convened an emergency meeting of representatives of the city's businesses yesterday afternoon. Many assistance measures were decided upon at the meeting. All businesses in the city and the First Special District also issued declarations of support. Details are as follows:

Firm Determination to Support the Strike

More than eighty Chinese medicine stores in the French Concession of this city, due to the French Municipal Council's implementation of cutting off water and electricity and forcibly collecting the "Chinese Medicine Retail Sales Regulations Tax," launched a full strike at 3 pm the day before yesterday. According to reporter investigations, Daren Tang, Guang Sheng Tang, Taishan Tang, and four or five other companies have had their water and electricity cut off. The remaining pharmacies are mostly striking in support with a very firm attitude. If the Municipal Council does not restore water and electricity to the cut-off establishments first, resumption of operations cannot be expected. The Municipal Council continued to send personnel to various pharmacies yesterday, tearing off the strike notices posted on the doors and prohibiting them from being posted again, claiming that they were disrupting public order. However, it had no effect. The advertising sign in front of Tian Ji Tang on Avenue Edward VII was destroyed as a result, and a worker from Da De Sheng store was also arrested for posting notices. There were no other indications. The order of each business is excellent, adhering to the association's advice. Businesses in the city and the First Special District are equally indignant at this high-pressure policy of the French authorities and have issued declarations of support. According to reporter investigations, if the French Municipal Council shows no sign of realizing its error, they will not hesitate to strike in response, to achieve the goal of abolishing the harsh taxes.

Guild Held Emergency Meeting Yesterday

Since the strike broke out, the Pharmaceutical Industry Association reported the facts and requested negotiation to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Second Special District Citizens' Association also sent letters making the same request. Furthermore, at 4 pm yesterday, representatives of all businesses in the city were convened to hold an emergency meeting at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association. More than 300 people attended, including He Yuanming, a representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Yuan Hongjun, a representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Jiao Yitang, the director of the Central National Medical Hall, and representatives of the industry. The meeting was chaired by Gao Zhiwen. First, the chairman reported in detail on the negotiations with the French Municipal Council regarding this case, and the painful situation of being forced to strike. Then, representatives from the Party Headquarters, Director Jiao, and others delivered speeches, all hoping for an appropriate resolution soon, and asked all businesses to maintain order in the inevitable situation. Then, the conference passed the following resolutions: (1) No resumption of business until water and electricity are restored; (2) Refuse to pay all taxes before the incident is resolved; (3) Request all industry groups in the French Concession to unanimously support; (4) If necessary, businesses throughout the city will strike in support; (5) Request Party and government agencies to seriously negotiate with the French authorities regarding the barbaric act of cutting off water and electricity; (6) Request the press and various organizations to uphold justice and provide assistance; (7) Request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Taxpayers' Association to seriously negotiate with the French authorities; (8) Organize a maintenance team to maintain order during the strike to prevent villains from mixing in and causing trouble; (9) All measures are subject to the association's orders and must not be acted upon freely; (10) Measures to maintain stores with cut-off water and electricity: rent gasoline lamps, provide food and water; (11) Restore electricity unconditionally and demand compensation for business losses; (12) The French authorities should guarantee that the same act of cutting off water and electricity will not happen again in the future; (13) Issue a declaration of support from all businesses in the city and the First Special District to the businesses in the French Concession.

Request Authorities to Seriously Negotiate

The Chinese Medicine Industry Association submitted separate requests to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning, requesting serious negotiations. The original request stated: The French Municipal Council's cutting off water and electricity has triggered a serious situation of full strike, and we implore you to negotiate seriously. The French Municipal Council's attempt to force Chinese medicine stores to pay harsh taxes by cutting off water and electricity has already been reported to your association and bureau, and we implore you to quickly forward a letter to stop it. Fortunately, the deadline of the 12th has passed, and the problem can be resolved through proper channels. Unexpectedly, at 3 pm yesterday, the water and electricity of Daren Tang and Guang Sheng Tang and other Chinese medicine stores in Baxianqiao were suddenly cut off, and the strike of all businesses in the area was triggered within an hour. It is clear that cutting off water and electricity is a hegemonic means to coerce our tax-paying Chinese, and the desire to exploit them is the Municipal Council's only method. Our tax-paying Chinese have suffered much from their poison. Now, for the sake of self-defense, for the sake of fighting for dignity, and even more for the sake of seeking welfare for all tax-paying Chinese in the area, all businesses in the area are willing to endure the greatest pain and cooperate to silently observe the situation, fearing that it will expand. In addition to submitting reports and requesting assistance from all sectors, we have attached a copy of the medicine sales regulations and a translated copy of the French Municipal Council's reply, requesting your association and bureau to seriously negotiate to avoid expansion and protect business.

Declarations of Support from Businesses in Both Districts

All Chinese medicine businesses in the city and the First Special District of this city jointly issued a declaration yesterday afternoon, expressing support. The original text reads: It is our belief that the addition of new taxes must have a legal basis, and should especially carefully consider whether it is feasible in reality. Going against the tide will only cause trouble. At this time of increasingly severe commercial depression, if the French Municipal Council truly wants to maintain the remaining prosperity within its district, it should properly support and assist it to recover. How can it bear to oppress each other with harsh taxes, accelerating the rate of collapse? Instead, it reveals a ferocious face, using the cutting off of water and electricity as a tool to fulfill its desire to exploit every drop of marrow, obliterating reason and defiling civilization. Nothing is more egregious than this. Our businesses in the entire French Concession, under unreasonable oppression, with the consciousness of self-defense and maintaining dignity, resolutely make the greatest determination and carry out the most painful strike. We, the businesses in this district, in addition to sympathizing with them, are filled with indignation. In addition to urging the Industry Association to strongly protest, we will make practical preparations and pledge to be their backing. We hereby declare this, hoping for public consideration.

Send Letters to Various Organizations to Uphold Justice

The association also sent letters to the Local Association, the Municipal Education Association, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Fishermen's Association, the Municipal Women's Association, the Municipal Defense Committee, the First Special District Citizens' Federation, the United Federation of Teachers at All Levels, various industry associations, and various fellow-provincial associations, requesting them to uphold justice. An excerpt from the original letter reads: It is our belief that the French Concession authorities' treatment of tax-paying Chinese is extremely harsh, abusing their authority and cutting off water and electricity. Those who have experienced it mostly turn pale at the mention of it, and all with blood and vigor gnash their teeth. This time, our members in the French Concession, driven by righteous indignation, are willing to strike to deal with the situation. The success or failure, and the gains or losses, are inextricably linked to the future interests of all tax-paying Chinese in the area. We are hereby sending a special letter to you, respectfully requesting you to examine this and uphold justice, and we sincerely ask for your guidance to correct our shortcomings.

### Zhou Jue Scheduled to Host Diplomats from Various Countries

Also Scheduled to Host Leaders from All Sectors

Zhou Jue, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, has scheduled a tea party to be held at the new building of the office at 6 Difeng Road from 5 pm to 7 pm on the afternoon of the 22nd of this month to foster relationships with ambassadors, ministers, and consuls-general from various countries stationed in Shanghai.

### Tea Farmer Representatives from Anhui Come to Shanghai to Request

Assistance in Developing the Tea Industry

Taiping County, Anhui Province, has always been a tea-producing area. Due to adherence to traditional methods of cultivation and the inflexibility of the rural economy, the excellent famous product (tea leaves) has been buried and unheard of, and the livelihoods of tea farmers have declined day by day. Now, after deliberations by all tea farmers, they are trying to improve the production methods for the purpose of promotion. In order to seek economic assistance and develop foreign trade, Sun Fuxian and Xu Maoqing have been specially sent as

Representatives of the Tea Farmers to Come to Shanghai to Request the China National Products Maintenance Association of this city to forward their request to the National Economic Council to approve the designation of a bank to set up a temporary office in Taiping County, and to introduce them to participate in the registration of the Tea Industry Control Committee and the International Trade Bureau. Sun and Xu arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and brought a letter to the China National Products Maintenance Association for request. The association sent Secretary Sun Zheng to meet them. He decided to forward all the points raised by the tea farmers in the county. The original letter is recorded as follows: Respectfully, we have learned that Taiping County in southern Anhui has always been a tea-producing area. In past years, due to rural bankruptcy, the inflexibility of the economy, and the manufacturing process

Adhering to Traditional Methods and the lack of publicity, the excellent famous tea has been buried and unheard of. This year, agricultural production is abundant and the economy is improving. In addition to the original tea mountains, a large number of new areas have recently been developed. The output is expected to increase. More than 70 rural cooperative organizations have been established, and loans of about 80,000 yuan have been issued. The countryside can be remedied, and the future development can be expected. However, due to economic reasons, it is a pity that it cannot be sold throughout the country and the development of foreign trade is hampered. Now, after deliberations by all tea farmers, at this time when the National Government is working hard to promote national products, we plan to imitate the Qimen black tea method, trying to

Improve the Production Process in order to promote sales. Therefore, Sun Fuxian and Xu Maoqing have been specially sent as representatives of all tea farmers in Taiping County to come to Shanghai to earnestly request your association to introduce them to participate in the registration of the Tea Industry Control Committee and the International Trade Bureau, and to request you to forward this to the National Economic Committee, allowing a designated bank to set up a temporary office in Taiping County to provide assistance nearby, supervise the purchase, and issue loans against the goods in accordance with regulations, and collect documents to benefit the operation and benefit the countryside. It is a matter of promoting the special products of the country, and we implore you to approve the request and to help the rural public welfare. This is to the China National Products Maintenance Association, from all the tea farmers of Taiping County, Anhui Province.

Thousands of Employees Petition for Relief

Xin Sheng She reports that the routes under the state-run China Merchants Inland River Steamship Bureau include 23 routes such as Shenhu, Shenhang, and Shensu, with a total of about 40 small ships and company ships.

After deliberation, Chen Meisi, Xia Tongzhang, Shen Jingyi, Shen Gendi and others were elected to submit a document to the Social Affairs Bureau at 2 pm in the afternoon, requesting relief to avoid unemployment of workers. Zhu Guilin, a mediator from the Third Section, received them and promised to forward the request to the director for approval. The representatives were satisfied and returned at about 4 o'clock. At the same time, they submitted a request to General Manager Cai of the General Bureau, requesting the Ministry of Communications to revoke the order to suspend operations, and explained their opinions.

Rong Zongjing, a giant in the industry, published his opinions on planting cotton in Hainan, saying that China is a country based on agriculture, with rice and wheat occupying an important position in agricultural production, followed by mulberry, and then cotton. Since the rise of the textile industry, the Chinese have begun to pay attention to cotton planting, but the output is limited, and most of the raw materials are supplied from abroad, resulting in a huge drain. In recent years, the government has been reviving the countryside,

Promoting Domestic Products and Cotton Planting has made rapid progress. Last year's output broke the previous record. However, raw materials above 60 counts are still lacking. The climate and soil are closely related to agricultural production. For example, in Shandong, Henan, and Shaanxi, although the spread of cotton seeds has yielded abundant harvests, the climate and soil are mostly suitable for coarse species, not for fine species. Given the vastness of our country's land, the place with the climate and soil suitable for fine species and capable of producing a large amount is Hainan. Hainan is the hometown of Chairman Song of the Bank of China. All that Song has gained from this inspection has been fully disclosed in the newspapers, and his development plan is far-sighted and extremely admirable. I (Rong) run a yarn factory and feel that planting

Cotton is the Lifeblood of Yarn Factories. Considering Hainan's climate and soil, after cultivating Egyptian sea island cotton, our country's fine yarn raw materials will absolutely not be a problem. I have been hesitant about this matter for a long time, and I did not have the opportunity to speak until now. A few years ago, there was a You Xiyin in Wuxi, who was extremely honest and had a special interest in agriculture. He personally went to Hainan to try planting cotton, and the results were excellent. According to him, planting in January and harvesting flowers in June, without encountering wind and rain, the boll is as big as a peach, the fiber is one and three-tenths to one and seven-tenths of an inch, and can be spun into 80-count fine yarn. Each plant can be three or four feet high, like a clump of trees, and does not wither in winter, and can continue for two or three years, but does not produce flowers and fruits, as You said. Unfortunately, at that time, due to economic and personnel reasons, no one helped him and he could not continue his research. Now that Song has the determination to develop Hainan, planting cotton seems to be an urgent task. I think this matter is important and should be presided over by the Cotton Control Association, dispatching

Experts for On-the-Spot Investigation and practical implementation. First, start with propaganda to make local farmers aware that the benefits of planting cotton are better than any other agricultural product. On the one hand, organize cooperatives, concentrate economic talents, from purchasing seeds to harvesting, and concentrate all attention, increase credit, and expand. Take advantage of the weather and make the most of the land. The annual output of 1.5 million bales, Chinese factories 60 counts or more,

Raw Material Supply is More than Enough and Exports can be Greatly Increased. It can be exported and compete with cotton-producing countries in the world. Moreover, harvesting flowers in June is the time when the new and old are not connected. The acquisition of this new cotton is a world-leading move. If it is handled properly, the results can be controlled. Today, European and American countries are competing to plant cotton, and powerful countries are rich in cotton production. Just like our country, this year's cotton production has increased, and the rural business has a clear recovery. The relationship between cotton planting and the national fortune is such that the Chinese should pay attention to it. Before the flood in the 20th year of the Republic of China, I purchased 200 tons of cotton seeds and transported them to various provinces of Shandong, Henan, and Shaanxi for planting, and achieved results in rural areas and commerce. If cotton planting is implemented in Hainan, its benefits will be many times greater.

### Shanghai Municipal Council to Discuss Opinions on Employees Today

May Make Some Revisions

The China Mail reports that the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council will meet tomorrow (20th) to accept the criticisms of the Municipal Council's employees on the economic plan. There may be important revisions to this plan. Members of the Employees' Union and many personnel of the Police Department have expressed their opinions on this plan. However, the Police Department's comments and suggestions will be submitted to the Board of Directors later. Chief Inspector Major Joly had asked the Police Department personnel to express their opinions, but Joly is currently on sick leave, staying in Hong Kong and will return to Shanghai before the end of the month, so it will be submitted to the Board of Directors after he arrives in Shanghai. Joly is currently in Hong Kong studying this economic issue. When the report of the Special Economic Committee of the Municipal Council was published last year, the affected employees were asked to express their opinions. Many people believe that the Board of Directors may make some revisions due to the opposition of the employees. It is expected that the situation of the economic plan at this meeting will be published in detail to reassure the public.

### President Yamamoto of the Japan Kaizo-sha Returns to Japan Today

Yamamoto Sanetohiko, president of the Japan Kaizo-sha, came to China this time for sightseeing and visited leaders from all walks of life in Beijing and Shanghai to discuss the fundamental adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations. It has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that he visited President Kong of the Central Bank with Mr. Matsumoto Shigeharu, president of the Shanghai Allied News Agency, the day before yesterday, and had a pleasant conversation. Kong specially hosted a banquet for Yamamoto, who is known as an independent and liberal commentator, and has a deep understanding of the stability and consolidation of the political foundation and the efforts to promote economic construction of the new China. He also wrote an inscription for the Kaizo magazine to encourage the Japanese authorities and civil leaders to eliminate the major obstacles to Sino-Japanese friendship. It is heard that Yamamoto has scheduled to return to Japan on the afternoon of the 20th (today) on the Haruna Maru. The following is a farewell poem from Shou Yicheng to Yamamoto: The Book of Changes says, "When a gentleman dwells in his chamber and his words are good, they are responded to from a thousand miles away, how much more so those who are near." It also says, "That which stirs the world is preserved in words, transformation and wealth are preserved in change, and promotion and action are preserved in communication." President Yamamoto, with the authority of the press, is planning the fundamental adjustment of the national relations between China and Japan. His enthusiasm and insight are deeply admired. Now, as we cherish the farewell, I write a few lines to leave a lasting impression. Written on January 19, 26th year of the Republic of China, Yicheng Duo Jingwei respectfully.

### Eurasia Corporation's Business Report for Last Year

The Eurasia Aviation Corporation is a Sino-German joint venture with a current capital of 9 million yuan. Its scheduled routes total over 4,600 kilometers. The total flight mileage for last year was over 910,000 kilometers. The number of passengers, calculated up to the end of November, reached over 5,000, an increase of approximately 40% compared to 1935. This surge in business is attributed to the company's widespread adoption of large aircraft, which have provided stable and fast flights. The company released its business report for last year yesterday, and excerpts are recorded below:

Business Overview: The Ministry of Communications, with the aim of realizing air transport between Europe and Asia, entered into the Eurasia Airmail Contract with Deutsche Lufthansa A.G. in 1930. The Ministry of Communications invested 2 million yuan (now increased to 6 million yuan), and Lufthansa invested 1 million yuan (now increased to 3 million yuan) to establish the Eurasia Aviation Corporation in accordance with the laws of the Republic of China. The purpose was to prepare for an air route from Shanghai to Berlin. The implementation plan was to start with domestic routes within China, starting from Shanghai and gradually extending to the Sino-Russian border, and then directly to Berlin. The contract originally stipulated the following routes: 1. From Shanghai via Nanjing, Tianjin, Beiping, and Manzhouli, through Asian Russia to Europe. 2. Or from Shanghai via Nanjing, Tianjin, Beiping, and a Chinese border city other than Kulun, through Asian Russia to Europe. 3. Or from Shanghai via Nanjing, Gansu, and the Chinese border of Xinjiang, through Asian Russia to Europe. The company was established in February 1931. After considerable active preparation, regular flights began in May of the same year on the first route mentioned above, between Shanghai and Manzhouli. Unfortunately, before April could be completed, the operations were interrupted by the Manchurian Incident. After the Manchurian Incident, the company immediately engaged in the operation of the third route. This route was characterized by interlocking mountains, vast deserts, harsh climate, and sparsely populated areas. The construction of airfields, the building of houses, and the organization of telecommunications, transportation, oil storage, and the replacement of machine parts were extremely difficult. However, regular flights on the 2,000-kilometer section from Shanghai to Lanzhou began in April 1932. By June 1933, the route had officially reached Dihua. Unfortunately, from September of the same year, the section from Lanzhou to Dihua was interrupted again due to international political obstacles within Xinjiang. After encountering two international obstacles, the company actively engaged in the development of domestic routes on one hand to make adjustments and quietly await the change in the political situation in Xinjiang. On the other hand, it sought other routes to reach Europe via the southwestern border of China through southern Asia. However, for three years, the resumption of flights in Xinjiang remained temporarily impossible, and the passage through southern Asia was also in the research stage due to the complexity of the international situation and could not be realized immediately. Therefore, the company's current operations are still temporarily focused on domestic routes.

Current Status of Routes: Although the company's international routes have not yet been opened, the domestic routes operated in China over the past five or six years have seen considerable development. Except for the Shanghai-Xinjiang route from Shanghai to the Russian border, which could only continue to operate to Lanzhou from October 1933 due to the inability to pass through Xinjiang, the Ping-Yue (Beiping to Guangzhou) route was added in May 1934, the Lan-Bao (Lanzhou to Baotou) route was completed in November of the same year, and the Shan-Rong (Shaanxi to Chengdu) route was opened in September 1935. All the above routes have continued to operate without interruption. However, the Ping-Yue route only operated the section from Beiping to Zhengzhou from July 1935. At the end of 1935, the Ministry of Communications ordered the company to plan and operate the Jing-Dian (Nanjing to Yunnan) route, with the aim of reaching Kunming. As a result of the test flights in February of this year, it was decided to extend the Shan-Rong route to Kunming, and it officially opened to traffic on April 1 of last year, designated as the Shaan-Dian route. After the Xi'an Incident, Xi'an and Lanzhou were temporarily unable to operate. From December 15, 1936, in compliance with the order of the Ministry of Communications, before the Shaanxi issue was completely resolved, the company's routes, except for Xi'an and Lanzhou, continued to operate as usual, and Taiyuan was added as a stop.

Equipment Improvements: 1. The company constantly improved and expanded the airfields. In addition to installing lighting equipment at Shanghai Airport for safe night flights, a huge aircraft hangar was built at Shanghai Longhua Airport, which was completed in June of last year, costing a total of 150,000 yuan. The hangar can simultaneously store three large aircraft and is equipped with a repair shop, telecommunications room, staff offices, and exquisitely decorated reception rooms. Its meticulous design, beautiful layout, and grand exterior are unparalleled in the Far East. Moreover, the company's routes mostly traveled to the northwestern frontier, where the journeys are long and difficult, and land transportation is extremely challenging. Without detailed planning in advance, it would be difficult for the company's business to develop. Fuel is the most important factor. Therefore, for flight safety, the company spent a lot of money to build three huge underground oil tanks in Xi'an, each with a capacity of 50 tons. According to the current fuel consumption of all aircraft, the oil stored in Xi'an alone is sufficient for five months. Therefore, the company has no fear of running out of fuel on the northwestern route. 2. Telecommunications equipment: Before 1936, both aircraft and land were equipped with long-wave radios, as long waves are more stable and accurate than short waves. However, the range of long waves is not as far as short waves, and they are easily disturbed by static electricity. Most of the company's routes are in the northwest, where the climate is very harsh, and the distance between stations is very long. For flight safety, short-wave radios were added to both aircraft and land stations. In this way, the advantages of both long and short waves can be fully utilized, and the disadvantages can be eliminated. In addition, four meteorological radio stations were added between Chengdu and Kunming, and between Xi'an and Lanzhou. Therefore, last year, no flights were delayed due to weather obstacles. As of the end of last year, the company had the following radio stations: 1. Shanghai 2. Nanjing 3. Zhengzhou 4. Guanyintang 5. Xi'an 6. Fengxiang 7. Hanzhong 8. Lanzhou 9. Jingning 10. Suzhou 11. Anxi 12. Ningxia 13. Baotou 14. Chengdu 15. Yibin 16. Guanghan 17. Guangyuan 18. Kunming 19. Xuanwei 20. Beiping 21. Hankou 22. Taiyuan. Furthermore, large aircraft are equipped with a homing beacon (i.e., the aircraft can independently determine its destination), which is faster and more accurate than ground-based radio direction finding (i.e., the ground-based radio direction finding station determines the direction and informs the aircraft). The device can use local broadcasts and radio stations for direction finding. The direction finding method uses hearing or vision to distinguish direction and only requires a simple switch, so it is extremely fast and convenient. 3. The aircraft used by the company at the beginning of its operations in 1931 were only Junkers F13 and W33. By March 1933, when the Shanghai-Xinjiang route was fully opened, the Junkers W34 began to be used on the western section of the Shanghai-Xinjiang route to adapt to the terrain and climate of the northwest. However, the above aircraft were not very large, and the passenger and cargo capacity was limited, and the equipment was not perfect. The company, in view of the increase in business and the increase in passengers and cargo each month, and the gradual extension and expansion of the routes, successively added several Junkers Ju52 large aircraft, which were deployed on various routes. By the end of last year, all of the company's routes were flown entirely by large aircraft.

Business Overview: In order to enhance the confidence of general passengers in air travel and the development of business, the company entered into a contract with Allianz und Stuttgarter Verein Versicherungs A.G. of Germany to establish accident insurance for ordinary air passengers. This insurance covers all passengers, whether paying, free, or discounted. The main compensation conditions are: A. Death: 10,000 yuan, Chinese legal tender; B. Total disability: 10,000 yuan; C. If injured and completely unable to work for a short period of time, a maximum of 10 yuan per day will be paid for recuperation. This insurance is completely handled by the company on behalf of the passengers free of charge, and passengers do not have to pay any insurance premiums in addition to the standard fare, and can enjoy the right to this accident compensation. This system is still a pioneering concept in our country and is a unique advantage of the company. 2. The company's most important mission is to facilitate air transport between Europe and Asia. However, it is regrettable that it has not been fully unblocked due to special circumstances. The domestic routes currently operated by the company are all in the border areas of China, which are relatively backward in culture and commerce, mostly plateau mountainous areas or desert areas, with extremely harsh terrain and climate. The company has been operating here for five or six years, and it has been able to achieve continuous progress in its business. The cargo figures have shown a significant and steady increase in each year, especially the rate of increase this year, which is more significant than in previous years. A table is listed below for comparison:

The figures marked with × only include statistics up to November 1936. The figures for December were not included due to the urgency of time.

Future Plans: The company's future business development, in addition to restoring the Ping-Yue route in the short term, will also strive to realize international airmail. The Ping-Yue route currently only operates between Beiping and Zhengzhou. With the full opening of the Yuehan Railway last year, the development of passenger and cargo transportation can be expected in the future. Therefore, the company plans to extend the route from Zhengzhou to Hankou first, and has submitted it to the Ministry of Communications for approval. Once approved and the plan is ready, it can be realized in the shortest time. The Shanghai-Xinjiang route can reach the Russian border, and the journey from Shanghai to Berlin, Germany, will only take a maximum of five days. This can be proved by the fact that the company's three Junkers W34 flew from Berlin to Shanghai three times in September 1933. If another route is taken from Shanghai via Myanmar and India to Berlin, it will only take seven or eight days. This can be proved by the fact that the Ju52 large aircraft came to Shanghai several times in September 1934 and August-September 1935. The company hopes to live up to the expectations of the society and people at home and abroad, and will continue to work hard to seek the resumption of the full Shanghai-Xinjiang route, so as to promote the realization of international airmail transport arriving in five days between Europe and Asia. However, the situation in Xinjiang is special, and it is difficult to realize it in the short term. However, the company also intends to use Shanghai-Yunnan as a basis to seek the possibility of a route directly from Kunming to Myanmar and India to reach the European continent. This still depends on the support of the government authorities and the cooperation of the public, so as to promote it.

### Thief Held Up with Fake Gun, Captured with Four Gunshot Wounds

Chinese Constable Hit by Stray Bullet on Forehead

Xie Deyan, an employee of the Bank of China, residing at No. 25 Baden Terrace, Tongfu Road, was suddenly approached by a robber, Tao Boliang (also known as Ah Bao, 44 years old, from Shaoxing), alone at 2:30 PM the day before yesterday. Tao broke into Xie's house through the back door, pulled out a pistol (it was found that the gun was fake, except for the iron pipe as the muzzle, the rest was made of black-coated glutinous rice flour), and threatened the maid to be quiet, watching her in the kitchen. Since Tao was alone, he abandoned the maid and went upstairs to rob. The maid, seeing the robber go upstairs, went out to report to the Sikh constable, who relayed the message to the Chengdu Road Police Station, and also called No. 3026 Chinese constable. Unexpectedly, Tao, having robbed 26 yuan in small change and carrying a fake handgun, was escaping from the back door. The constable took preemptive action, drew his pistol, fired one shot, and hit Tao's leg, causing him to fall to the ground. Just as the Chinese constable was about to arrest him, constables No. 2452, No. 2242, and No. 3082 from the Xinzha Police Station arrived, each raising their pistols and firing seven or eight shots. As a result, Tao was shot four times in both legs, and Chinese constable No. 3026 was also hit in the forehead by a stray bullet. At that time, Chinese detective Feng Baishun and detectives Xia Shikui and Ting Yutang, dispatched by the police station, also arrived, and took the injured Chinese constable and Tao in a car to the Municipal Council Hospital for treatment. They also investigated the scene of the incident, seized a fake handgun, stolen goods of 26 yuan in small change, four bullets, and seven shell casings, and brought them to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Yesterday morning, Tao Boliang was in the hospital due to his injuries, so only the case file and evidence were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station lawyer, Li Zhishan, filed a lawsuit according to Article 328 of the Criminal Law, and stated the above circumstances, requesting a postponement. The judge changed the date, postponing the hearing for 14 days until the defendant recovers from his injuries.

### Ye Kaixin Sues Du Yufei

Jointly Operated Women's Physical Education School - Recovering Overdue Payments

Ye Kaixin, styled Jingqiu, a historical figure in the history of the Republic of China and a strong general of the Hunan Army, although holding the position of General Counselor of the Military Senate after being relieved of his duties as the commander of the 44th Army, it was a leisure position. During the heyday of law colleges in Shanghai where he once stayed as a recluse, Ye, in response to the trend of the times, founded Jiangnan College at the Jin Situ Temple on Kangnuo Road in western Shanghai, and served as the chairman of the board of directors. Guo Wei, a Shanghai lawyer, once served as the president of the college. It had not been open for three years when it was ordered to close by the Ministry due to poor enrollment and performance. Ye then jointly operated the China Women's Physical Education Teacher Training School with Du Yufei. Now Ye Kaixin has entrusted his outstanding Jiangnan graduate, lawyer Wang Liwu, to sue Du Yufei in the local court to recover: (1) 26,843 yuan in overdue payments, plus interest at 1.5% per month from June 1, 1935, until the date of execution; (2) Confirmation of liability for compensation for damages; (3) An order to hand over the accounts of the China Women's Physical Education Special School under his management for liquidation. The facts stated in the complaint state that Du Yufei entered into a contract with the plaintiff on March 4, 1935, to jointly operate the China Women's Physical Education Teacher Training School, using the buildings and all movable property (including equipment and books) built on the leased land of Jiangnan College as advertised, valued at 80,000 yuan. Due to the joint operation relationship between the two parties, the defendant should pay the plaintiff 40,000 yuan in national currency. However, because it was not easy for the defendant to raise the money at one time, the defendant and the plaintiff agreed on a method of paying in installments. Unexpectedly, the defendant only paid the plaintiff 13,157 yuan successively. Thereafter, all agreements were breached. A total of 26,843 yuan is still owed to the plaintiff, which has not been paid off. Repeated demands have been made, but with repeated delays, hence the lawsuit for the above requests. Judge Yuan opened the court yesterday morning. Ye Kaixin was absent, and the attorney appeared on his behalf, stating that the plaintiff was 49 years old and from Hunan, residing at No. 4 Taiping Bridge, Nanjing, and stated the circumstances of the lawsuit. The defendant was also absent, and was represented by lawyer Cai Xiaobai, who stated in court that the China Women's Physical Education Teacher Training School could not be opened because the term "specialty" (專門) did not comply with the regulations and was rejected. Therefore, there was no partnership nature, and there was no compensation to be made and no facts of payment owed. Because it could not be opened, the defendant hung up the old sign of the China Women's Physical Education School, which he had run for 20 or 30 years. Therefore, there was no relationship with the plaintiff whatsoever, and could only be considered a school building sub-leasing relationship. Moreover, Ye owed money to the construction company for building Jiangnan College, which has already been judged. Lawyer Wu Kaisheng sent a letter notifying that if there was a debt, payments should be stopped. At the same time, the plaintiff mortgaged the school building to the Salt Industry Bank, and also sent a letter notifying the reservation of creditor's rights. Therefore, it is fundamentally impossible to file a lawsuit against the defendant. At this point, the court debate was adjourned for further hearing.

### Root Brother in Headless Box Corpse Case Completely Reverses Previous Confessions on Appeal

Everything Stated Previously is Completely False - Closing of Hearing Declared, Sentencing Scheduled

The Legal Department of the Public Concession Municipal Council, dissatisfied with the acquittal of Lin Gendi (female), Mao Agen, and Jiang Yuanying in the headless box corpse case by the First Special District Court, filed an appeal, which has been investigated in a court session by the Second Branch of the High Court. The circumstances have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the Criminal Court of the Second Branch of the High Court, headed by presiding judge Yu Hua, accompanied by judges Nie and Xiao and prosecutor Lin, continued the hearing in the first criminal court. Mao Agen's lawyer and Feng Shuhua, the lawyer appointed by the court to defend Lin Gendi and Jiang Yuanying, appeared in court. First, police lawyer Gan Jingxian stated the reasons for the appeal (which have been reported previously and are omitted). Then, Lin Gendi, who had always admitted to killing Caiying with Mao Agen and Jiang Yuanying, suddenly recanted, claiming that his confessions regarding the killing of Caiying were completely false, and that he had been forced to make them due to torture. He did not know Caiying at all, had never met her, and had never been to No. 1 Cunfu Lane. The court immediately asked that since this was not the case, why did he say he had killed someone in front of a trolleybus in front of the cigarette shop on Carter Road before the case was solved. Lin also denied this, and in short, overturned all previous confessions, repeatedly claiming innocence. Mao Agen and Jiang Yuanying still consistently maintained their previous claims, firmly denying everything. Then the court ordered Ye Kuiyu, the head of Cunfu Lane, to be brought to court, who also claimed that there was no Caiying living in house number three in the lane. Presiding judge Yu then ordered the start of the debate. First, police lawyer Gan debated, requesting the original judgment to be set aside and Lin et al. to be punished with the crimes they deserved. Then, lawyer Fan Gang defended Mao Agen, stating briefly that the police's appeal was completely based on Lin Gendi's confession. Now that Lin has completely reversed his previous confession, their appeal has no basis at all. Even based on Lin's previous confession, it does not correspond with the facts, such as the contradiction between the dates, and the claim that when he went to kill Caiying, he saw Caiying covered with a quilt lying on the bed. How could anyone be covered with a quilt in ninety-degree weather? Moreover, the investigation of household registration in the Chinese area is very strict. How could anyone dare to sublet a house privately? Furthermore, the appellants all claimed that the confessions were obtained through torture. Therefore, the appellant's appeal has no reason and should be dismissed. Finally, lawyer Feng debated briefly. Presiding judge Yu then declared the hearing closed and scheduled the judgment to be announced at 2 PM on the 26th.

### Heavy Rain Causes Car Collision

Driver Injured

Yesterday morning at around 1:40, a service car with license plate number 12524, driven by car driver Zhu Wanzhang (21 years old, from Ningbo) of the World Automobile Company at 397 Edward Road, was traveling south on Gordon Road near the intersection of Connaught Road in western Shanghai when it collided with a public bus with license plate number 15138 (carrying workers returning from Yangshupu), driven by Xu Jinshou, 36 years old, from Tongzhou, traveling west. Due to the heavy rain, it was difficult to distinguish clearly, resulting in the collision of the two cars. As a result, the service car of the World Company was damaged, with the front glass water tank mudguard broken, and the car driver Zhu Wanzhang had a broken left chest bone, a very serious injury. The public bus driver Xu Jinshou also suffered abrasions to his left arm. After the accident, Chinese constable No. 2309 from the Gordon Road Police Station arrived and took both injured parties to Shijiang Hospital for treatment.

### Public Concession Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to Municipal Council

Requesting No Increase in Taxes

The Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, in response to a letter from the City Federation stating that the Municipal Council is considering increasing taxes, sends a special letter to stop it. Dear Sir, we received a letter from the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, stating that the executive committee members Liu Zhongying, Ge Futian, and Gu Yucang have jointly written a letter stating that, having read in the newspaper that the Public Concession authorities are planning to increase the municipal tax by 2% from this year onwards to supplement funds, they are extremely shocked. They state that, affected by the economic downturn in recent years, the market has declined to its extreme. Industrial, commercial, and residential households are already feeling overwhelmed by the existing rents and taxes. If they are to be subjected to more heavy taxation, they will be driven to the brink of ruin, and the future will be unbearable. The social security will also be adversely affected. We cannot remain silent. We request your association to consider the suffering of the taxpayers at this time when the Municipal Council is undecided, argue reasonably, negotiate to stop it, etc. This has been submitted to the fourteenth executive committee meeting for discussion, and it was unanimously agreed that, given the current economic downturn, if the concession authorities were to have this plan, this policy of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs would inevitably make the economic situation of the citizens more difficult, and the various industrial and commercial sectors would fall into an unimaginable state. The concession authorities should pay close attention. We hereby send a special letter requesting your association to consider the difficulties of the times, forward a letter to the Municipal Council to fundamentally revoke the proposed tax increase. The citizens would be fortunate, and the industry and commerce would be fortunate. Due to the meeting, the market situation and the social economic capacity, those with some common sense should be able to know it, without waiting for an explanation to your bureau. Moreover, in order to cope with this very tight period, we should request your bureau to pay attention to the frugality suggestions of our association years ago, and actively adopt them, especially to completely eliminate the "outdated" exchange rate subsidies, so that 1.7 million yuan can be saved in a year. Please do not continue to use irresponsible remarks such as "an extra yuan is added to a 100-yuan rent, and four yuan is added to a 200-yuan rent" (the North-China Daily News printed it as five yuan) to "be generous at the expense of others," and cause public panic. This is addressed to Mr. Fei, the General Manager of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council.

At the same time, the reply letter to the City Federation says: In reply to your letter of January 12, regarding the proposed tax increase by the Public Concession Municipal Council. Upon investigation, Chief Director An Nuode has often spoken about this issue, and it is not the first time. However, this year it is more concrete, saying "only two yuan will be added per month for a rent of one hundred yuan, and four yuan will be added for two hundred yuan" (the North-China Daily News reported it as five yuan, it is unknown who is wrong.) In addition to this, there are no concrete proposals. It is thought that the directors of the bureau are not as diligent as us, otherwise, the fable of King Atum would have been completely forgotten. In addition to a special letter to the bureau, please find enclosed for your information. This is addressed to the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Introduces Domestic Export Products

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday received a letter from Mr. J. L. Lipson of New York, USA, which says: Dear Sir, I have extensive research on botanical medicinal materials. I would like to know the names and addresses of Chinese and foreign firms in your country that specialize in importing ginseng. I can open and send official prices and possibly contact importers in your country for everything, which is what I hope for. At the same time, I am also engaged in the import business, and I am very willing to represent Chinese merchants in my country to operate the import of various goods, which I am most interested in. I work as an agent for customers on a commission basis, and I am very willing to accept commissions from first-class firms in your country. Respectfully, the goods he listed include various volatile oil spices and spice seed plant medicinal materials. Also, the Dutch shipping company Hai Chang Foreign Company also sent a letter introducing ephedra and other items.

### County-Wide Re-Investigation of Opium Addiction Reveals Fifty-Seven Offenders

Chenghuang Temple to be Used as Temporary Detention Center

The Shanghai County Government attaches great importance to the thorough eradication of opium addiction in this county-wide re-investigation of opium, and therefore, is handling the situation with severity. Since its implementation this month, the Anti-Opium Section Chief Shen Jiaqi, together with Public Safety Bureau Chief Yin Xiongfei, have been traveling to various townships in the first, second, and third districts of Puxi to conduct house-to-house re-investigations. A total of fifty-seven opium addicts have been apprehended, and those who privately sell and smoke opium have not been spared. Furthermore, starting yesterday, investigations were conducted in the fourth and fifth districts of Pudong. From the 18th, a county-wide mobilization for re-investigation will commence. On the other hand, County Magistrate Li Zhifu has noted that the number of opium addicts detained is steadily increasing. Since the county has no prison, and the detention center is extremely small, in addition to requesting the Songjiang Third District Special Office to approve a location for accommodating convicted criminals, and expanding the detention center, it is planned to use the Chenghuang Temple as a temporary detention facility.

### General Strike by All Workers at Ruirong Factory Yesterday, Then Work Resumed

According to the Dagong News Agency, the British-owned Ruirong Shipyard on Yangshupu Road in Eastern Shanghai has two factories, new and old, employing a total of over 700 workers, and is organized as the Fourth District Shipbuilding Workers Union. In the past, the union had agreements with the factory regarding labor and compensation conditions, which had been in place for many years. Recently, due to the factory's announcement of reorganization in 1935, the factory sent a letter to the union on December 18 of last year declaring the cancellation of the signed labor conditions. Upon hearing the news, all the workers panicked and the union negotiated several times but without result. Therefore, at around 7:00 AM yesterday, all the workers entered the factory, but except for a small number of junior workers who continued to work as usual, the remaining 500 or more workers declared a joint strike to urge the factory to understand. The order was very good and they waited for the authorities to mediate according to the law.

Party and Government Mediation: The labor side sent representatives to the Party and government agencies and the General Labor Union to petition for assistance. After receiving the report, the authorities sent Lu Yinchu from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zhu Jintao from the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhou Xuexiang from the General Labor Union, together with a translator, to the factory to mediate. The Associate Manager of the British United Shipyards, Ai Mu, received them. As a result of the mediation, it was decided that: (1) Regarding the new compensation conditions set by the factory, the Associate Manager will be responsible for urging the board of directors to respond within two weeks. (2) After the labor conditions are drafted, they will be submitted to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau for review and publication in accordance with Chinese factory regulations. (3) Before the new conditions are published, regarding the workers' work, the previously determined 15 days of work per month will now be changed to 12 days of work out of every 28 days by the Associate Manager.

Persuading Resumption of Work: After the representatives of the Party and government agencies reached a mediation decision, they convened all the workers in the open space of the factory to speak and report on the content of the mediation, persuading the workers to immediately resume work. The workers of the factory, to show their compliance with the orders of the superior authorities, expressed their absolute support for the decisions. At around 10:00 AM, they all entered the factory and resumed work. The order was very good.

### Sanxing Tobacco Factory Ceases Operations and Dissolves, Workers Petition Yesterday

Upon hearing the news, all 400 or more workers panicked. At 2:00 PM yesterday, they sent Shao Acai and others to petition the Social Affairs Bureau, stating their opinions and requesting that the dissolution of the company be prevented to avoid the unemployment of hundreds of workers. The mediator of the Third Section, Zhu Guilin, received them and promised to forward the petition to the director for review. They then went to the Municipal Party Headquarters to make a similar petition. Zhang Sheng, the General Manager of the Civil Affairs Section, received them and promised to handle it together with the Social Affairs Bureau.

### Boatman Dies from Coal Gas Poisoning

Yan Atong, a 43-year-old native of Pudong, had been working as a second mate on the Shuntai Company's No. 10 iron barge. The night before last, the boat was docked at Qichang Stack pier in Yongdong for the night. Yan burned coal briquettes for warmth because of the cold weather and fell asleep. The next morning, he was discovered by someone to have been poisoned by coal gas and was unconscious. Shanhaiguan Water Patrol Police Hua Detective Shen Changshan rushed him to Yangshupu Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment, but he died at 2:00 PM.

### Worker Chops Foreman Due to Debt Dispute

Ji Erbao, a 47-year-old native of Nantong, resided at 70 Chengping Lane, Linping Road, north of Xinchan. He worked as a foreman at the Rihua Paint Company. Recently, he had a debt dispute with worker Shen Shan Hong (a 30-year-old native of Nantong residing in Dongjiazhai). Shen harbored a grudge and lured Ji to a rural area in Dongjiazhai at around 7:00 PM last night, where he used a pre-prepared ax to violently chop Ji's head twice. The skull was fractured about three inches, and blood flowed profusely. Ji fell to the ground in pain, and Shen abandoned the ax and fled. After the incident, someone discovered it and reported it to the police, who rushed Ji to the hospital for treatment. The fugitive suspect Shen Shan Hong is currently being actively pursued.

### Key Defendant in Shao Wenbin Case Accuses Western Detective of Dereliction of Duty and Bribery

And Also Letting Go of Key Defendants in the Case - Interrogation Ordered Yesterday Pending Investigation

Zhang Bingrong, a native of Ningbo (aged 35, nicknamed "Little Ningbo"), the murderer in the case of the assassination of Hua Hui King Shao Wenbin on Wagao Road in the French Concession on the night of July 28, 1933, was arrested by the French police and sent to court for prosecution. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and is currently serving his sentence in the Second Prison under the jurisdiction of Beixinjing. Recently, the French police arrested two key defendants in the case, Wang Shilong and Qian A Jin, and brought them to Zhang for questioning. Due to Wang and Qian's dissatisfaction with the verdict and their appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court, Zhang was required to testify and has not yet been sent back, and is temporarily detained in the Second Special District Prison. Now, Zhang has filed a petition with the Second Special Court Criminal Division, accusing the Twelfth Western Detective of the French Police Department of dereliction of duty and accepting bribes, letting go of the key defendant Chen Shuang'er, and requesting an investigation and arrest. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Sun Pengxian of the Second Criminal Court ordered Zhang to be brought in for questioning. Zhang claimed that he did not participate in the killing of Shao Wenbin and was wrongly convicted. This time, because Wang Shilong was arrested, the French police came to bring me to testify. On November 3, I was brought to the police station, but was not interrogated. It was not until the 21st that I was brought out. The Twelfth Western Detective beat me twice without asking the reason, causing me to be injured and vomit blood. I felt very unwilling. I also reported the address of Chen Shuang'er, a person related to the murder case, and asked them to arrest him, but they delayed the arrest, allowing Chen to escape. I request an investigation to seek justice. I asked if the Western Detective who beat you was French or Russian. He replied that he said two sentences to me in Chinese and was probably French. The court ordered an investigation and review, and ordered Zhang to be sent to the forensic doctor for treatment before being sent back to prison. It was also announced that if it was found that a Frenchman had beaten you, you could not sue here and should file a lawsuit with the French Consulate. The court adjourned.

### Two Defendants in Tang Youren Assassination Case Still Confess to Murder

Tang's Sister, Meishu, Did Not Appear Yesterday - Court Ordered Rescheduled Hearing on the 26th

Tang Youren, the former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs from Hunan, was shot and killed by assassins in front of his private residence in Gancun, Gansidong Road in the French Concession of this city on the evening of December 25, 1935. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau and the Public Concession Police successively arrested Liu Zhennan and Qiu Jiyu, the perpetrators who carried out the shooting. The French Police Department transferred them to the court for interrogation and detention for a month before completing the investigation. The Police Department's lawyer filed a public prosecution against the two defendants based on Article 271, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law for the crime of murder. The case was repeatedly heard by Wang Gangxu, the former presiding judge of the Second Special Court Criminal Division. The two defendants admitted to the killing of Tang with their accomplices who were still at large, but because the case still needed investigation, witnesses needed to be summoned for questioning, and defense lawyers needed to be appointed, the hearing was adjourned to a later date. This matter has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning,

Another Hearing Was Scheduled: Presiding Judge Chen Daqi of the First Criminal Court ordered Liu and Qiu to be brought to the case. After questioning their ages and hometowns, he declared a renewed hearing. First, Fei Xizhen, the lawyer from the Police Department, stated the case and the articles of the indictment. Then, the detectives reported on the investigation process of arresting the defendants. When questioned, Liu and Qiu still confessed to the shooting and killing of Tang Youren. Then, the witness Zheng Ma, the maid employed by the Tang family, testified, "That day, I was playing with the four-year-old young master on the fourth floor when I suddenly heard

Gunshots Outside: I didn't pay attention until I heard crying downstairs. I went downstairs to the second floor and saw the master (referring to Tang Youren) collapsed inside the door, barely breathing and unable to speak. I didn't see what was happening outside," and so on. Detective Zuo Qihong reported that Tang's sister, Tang Meishu, did not plan to appear in court to testify today because she was unable to come. After reviewing the situation, the court ordered the hearing to be rescheduled for the 26th, and the two defendants were returned to custody.

### Another Accomplice in Jingyun Building Robbery Arrested

Discovered During Handgun Inspection - The Robbers Have Committed Many Other Robberies

During the morning of last New Year's Eve, Liu Jingde's office in the Jingyun Building on Beijing Road was broken into and robbed, resulting in a tragic struggle to capture the robbers. Subsequently, after investigations by Chinese and Western detectives from the patrol police station, Wang Jinsheng, Deng Shaoch臣, Yu Fengsen, and eighteen others related to the case were arrested and sent to the First Special Court for detention. The details were reported in this newspaper. Previously, detective of the Chengdu Road police station, Shan Zhaoxian and Wang Buchang, learned that several bandits were planning to commit crimes in the area of the Huishi police station, but

They Must Pass Through: The intersection of Longmen Road and Race Course Road. They went to wait and at 3:30 PM in the afternoon, as expected, the bandits Chen Rongsheng (also known as Xiaojiangbei, Ye A Da, Ye Baozi), a native of Jiangbei, Chen Lianjin, a native of Shandong, and An Ziwen, came. They rushed forward and arrested Chen and the other three, found a gun and three bullets on Chen, and took them back to the police station. Hua Detective Chief Shang Wu of the Huishi police station also arrested a Jiangbei native, Han Xiaolong. Han has

Special Influence: In the Hongkou area, with many followers, specializing in supplying arms to bandits, and has been imprisoned many times. He was recently released last month for the same offense. The Chengdu Road police station sent the seized gun to the Firearms Inspection Office for inspection, and it was discovered that the gun was the one used to resist arrest during the Jingyun Building case. Because the Jingyun Building case has been accepted by the patrol police station, the two Chens, An, and Han

Were Sent Together: To the Central Police Station. Chief Detective Zhang Mingde, Detectives Jiang Shangpei, Wu Yaozu, and others investigated. Wang Jinsheng, who had already been arrested, identified Chen Rongsheng as the one who went to the Jingyun Building to rob and resist arrest at the time. They were immediately arrested and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the process, saying that the defendants in this case, in addition to the Jingyun Building case, had also committed

Many Other Robberies: And the investigation was quite difficult. Therefore, he requested a postponement to investigate and interrogate them together with Wang Jinsheng and others. When questioned, Chen Rongsheng only admitted to the names Ye A Da and Xiaojiangbei, and denied having the names Chen Rongsheng and Ye Baozi. After Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confession, he ordered all of them to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing to be held together with Wang Jinsheng and others. Also, the women Lu Xu Xiuzhen and Xu Honglin, who were arrested at 8 Xiaopi Road in Nanshi, were found by the police to be unrelated, so yesterday morning, lawyer Ru Baoyi asked the First Special Court to stop the detention, and Judge Feng approved, ordering the release of Ms. Lu and Xu.

### Unlicensed Opium Smokers Should Be Sent to the Garrison Command

Since Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu began handling anti-drug matters on January 1 of this year, it has been quite serious. Anyone involved in the manufacturing, trafficking, or smoking of potent drugs will be punished according to the anti-drug regulations without any leniency, so that those addicted to these drugs are afraid to try them for fear of punishment. Recently, he again instructed the Municipal Police Bureau that all opium smokers arrested by the various sub-bureaus without licenses, regardless of whether they are smoking, should be sent to the headquarters for interrogation and punishment and should not be disposed of without authorization. It is said that Director Cai has already notified the responsible departments and various sub-bureaus to comply.

### Candle Industry Announces to the Trade

The Shanghai Candle Industry Association stated that since Yuanfengrun Lin Ji was giving away gifts, and advice based on industry rules was ineffective, the association, in addition to petitioning the Social Affairs Bureau for assistance, also announced to the trade for self-encouragement. The declaration stated, "The candle industry has been declining for years and has reached its limit. Although this is due to the economic downturn, the huge sacrifices caused by giveaways between each other are also a major reason. Last year, to seek a remedy, the entire industry agreed to abolish giveaways, and at the same time, the union jointly provided practical assistance. The outline of the agreement was approved by the Social Affairs Bureau in October and repeatedly published in newspapers and sent to everyone for compliance. Since the rectification, considerable results have been seen, and everyone said that the industry's turnaround is promising. On January 6, Dongxinqiao Yuanfengrun Lin Ji Candle Shop opened, and it was rumored beforehand that the shop had giveaways prepared. Representatives were immediately sent to send a letter to politely stop them, but it was not satisfactory. Yin Sheng and others felt that their sincerity was not trusted, and sent letters separately to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Mr. Yu Qiaqing to find ways to mediate. Who knew that the shopkeeper agreed to change the ten days of giveaways to three days, but the person in charge of the shop continued to give away gifts, causing neighboring businesses, who Yin Sheng and others had tried their best to dissuade from starting competition, to be unbearable. However, Yin Sheng and others still considered the entire industry, and proceeded patiently without slacking off, asking the government and begging well-known people. Everything that could be done to avert this imminent crisis was done wholeheartedly. But as of last night, hope was exhausted, industry rules lost their effectiveness, the agreement was equivalent to a blank sheet of paper, and the corruption was imminent. Although Yin Sheng and others are foolish merchants, the reason why they reluctantly supported it was that they thought the laws and regulations were enough to follow. If this is the case, how can they continue to procrastinate? Moreover, eliminating annual customs is the key to the industry's annual business, and time is of the essence today. Yin Sheng and others cannot afford to delay any longer. Therefore, this announcement is made to state the process. All of our industry, in this environment, has no choice but to adapt to changes and seek survival. Alas, years of effort have been wasted in one day, and the five inner organs are devastated, what more can be said? But as long as there is a breath, we will continue to proceed. We hope for your understanding. Yin Sheng and other members of the Shanghai Candle Industry Association pay their respects."

國貨 專 刋

### 小 貢獻 本刊 今後 使命

— 仰 菴

告 讀者 與 國貨 界

本 刋 和 讀者 相見 已 歷 四年，於 提倡 宣揚 國貨 之 職責，未敢 一日 稍 弛，幸 荷 讀者 之 見稱，與 國貨 界 之 推重，吾人 改進 刋物 之 心志，與 國貨 界 希望 改進 其 出品，有 同樣 之 急切，蓋 一言一語，在在 足 繫 國貨 界 之 運命，與 推動 各方 愛用 國貨 之 力量。目下 國貨 界 之 情狀，已 由 逆勢 而 趨於 好轉 之 途徑，國貨 界 之 生機 蓬勃，即 爲 國貨 界 之 氣象 發展。吾人 於 慶幸 之 餘，益 願 奮 其 力量，以 自 効 於 國貨 界，而 盡 促進 鼓吹 之 微力，爲 更進 一歩 之 貢獻。

今後 本 刋 貢獻 於 國貨 界 之 責任，既 巨 且 重，其 需要 國貨 界 之 指示 與 合作，更 殷 且 切。吾人 將 如何 充實 其 內容，增多 其 資料，擴大 其 服務 範圍，以 副 大衆 之 期望。兹 就 吾人 之 願望，略 爲 陳述，希望 讀者 諸君 與 國貨 工業界 進 而 教 之。

（一）國貨 界 關心 本 刋 之 切 與 擁護 本 刋 之 誠意，最近 益 爲 明顯，馳 書 策 勉，郵電 問詢，殷殷 以 擴大 本利 服務 相 鼓勵，有 指定 以 廣告 刋 入 本 刋 者，本 刋 以 限於 篇幅，廣告 地位，雖 力事 擴展，但 一期 之中，未能 儘量 容納，極 爲 抱歉。甚 願 此後 分期 宣揚，以 資 普 徧，務使 廣告 效力，遍及 各 廠，此其一。

（二）本 刋 願 爲 國貨 工業界 公開 之 刋物，任何 一 廠 出品，苟 爲 國産 而 有 採用 之 價值 者，吾人 樂 予 表揚，以 介紹 於 愛用 國貨 之 同志，此外 讀者 倘以 國貨 問題，有所 垂詢，或 發表 意見，討論 事件 等等，吾人 願 竭 所 知，儘量 答復 與 刋 載，此其二。

（三）吳鐵城 市長 與 潘公展 局長，居 本市 服用 國貨 領導 之 地位；慨然 以 第一流 國貨 推薦 於 邦人，並 親 爲 題字，以 示 鄭重。其 熱忱 與 美意，尤 堪 欽敬。深 願 出品 廠家，益 自 砥礪，以 毋負 此 第一流 之 美稱，此其三。

（四）本 刋 爲 適應 讀者 與 國貨 界 請求 起見，於 留出 篇幅 二分之一 爲 推薦 優良 國貨 以外，其餘 二分之一，悉數 刋 載 文字，以 實際 訪問，或 參觀 資料，作 忠實 與 真確 之 記述，浮泛 之 議論，膚淺 之 見解，以及 敷衍 空虚 之 文字，一概 謝絶。幸 讀者 與 投稿 諸君子 今後 注意 於 真實 二字，俾 本 刋 聲價，更可 增重 於 國內，此其四。

（五）本 刋 文字 方面，既 力求 精采，而 廣告 方面，更 打破 呆板 機械 之 方式，方 以 新 耳目。今 得 本報 孫道勝 君 出 其餘力，力事 精進，以 副 各方 之 熱望，同時 於 撰述 編排，力求 改善，庶 第一流 國貨 之 推薦，可以 深入 民間，惹起 全國 注意，此其五。

本 刋 今後 致力 之 點 如此，願 循 此徑，懸的 以 趨，今年 之 本 刋，或可 與 國貨 界 之 展布，同開 一 新 紀錄 乎？

### 怎樣 使 民衆 信仰 國貨？

— 國 維

自從 民元 以來，貿易 入 超•一年 增加 一年，目前 入 超額，已達 每年 數萬 萬元 之 鉅；若 長此以往，則 再 隔 一 二十 年 後，入 超額 將 增加 至 百萬 萬 或 千萬 萬 的 數目，試想 我們 中國，有 多大的 財力，能 負起 這樣 重 漏 巵 的 擔負 呢？那時 中國，卽 使 不 被 人 用 武力 併吞，也 勢必 生 貧血症 而 自 亡。所以 現在 國內 有識之士，都 感覺到 提倡 國貨 實 是 救國 圖 存 基本 的 要務，但是 提倡 國貨，話可 很 容易 講，而 事實上 卻 很 難 實行，大 原因 是 因為 外貨 在 華 勢力 的 龐大，和 大多數 民衆 對於 國貨 缺乏 信 抑 的 緣故，所以 我們 要 提倡 國貨，必 先 把 障礙 國貨 發達 的 病源 去掉，就是 說 ㊀ 要 縮小 或 至 絕滅 外貨 在 華 勢力，㊁ 要 使 民衆 對於 國貨 生 信仰 心。至於 要 講到 怎樣 縮小 外貨 勢力，這是 政府 的 事，姑且 撇開 不談，我們 要 研究 的 是 怎樣 使 民衆 對於 國貨 生 信仰 心？以 作者 的 意思，應 照 下列 兩法 進行；茲 分別 寫在 後面，以 供 國貨 界 同人 的 參考。

一 積極 宣傳：在 現代 工商業 競爭 中，宣傳 是 佔有 很 重要 的 地位，國貨 要 和 外貨 競爭，也 自然 要 借重 宣傳 的 力量，宣傳 的 功用 可 使 民衆 對於 國貨 多 一層 認識，誘導 民衆 走上 對於 國貨 生 信仰 的 途徑，宣傳 的 方法 可分：㊀ 時常 舉行 國貨 展覽會；㊁ 發行 大量 刊物 介紹 各種 國貨 和 討論 如何 改善 國貨 等，並 要求 國內 報章 雜誌 對於 國貨 廣告 與 以 優待；㊂ 歡迎 個人 或 團體 至 國貨 廠家 參觀 並 將 有 價值 國貨 製造 情形，攝成 影片，時 往 學校，公園，舟車 等 公共 塲 所 開 映：㊃ 雖在 窮鄉僻巷 之 處，時常 須 派人 携帶 國貨 樣品 去 作 宣傳 等 工作。

二 務求 出品 精良，價格 低廉：若 宣傳 得法，民衆 對於 國貨 更有 想 相當 認識。若 再加 國貨 能 有 優良 的 品質 糧 低廉 的 價格，那麼 民衆 的 信仰 心 自然 發生了，反之 若是 宣傳 很 得法，而 品質 低劣 或 價值 過 昂貴，那麼 非但 民衆 對於 國貨 永遠 不 生 信仰，並且 反而 增加 他們 對於 外貨 的 信仰 力，這是 最 危險 不過 的 了。

總之，我們 要 希望 提倡 國貨，必 先 博得 民衆 的 信仰 心。有了 信仰 心，民衆 便 自然 樂用 國貨 外貨 也 自然 歛跡。國家，社會，民族 的 經濟 前途 方才 有 光明 的 一日。

### 勞資 合作 與 國貨 前途

— 孟 昭

我 記得 王雲五 先生 曾經 演說 過 “勞資 雙方 如 水泥 與 鋼骨，不可 分離 的，雙方 合作，為 事業 而 奮 鬬，前途 繼 有 光明 的 路 的。” 筆者 服務 工廠 七八年 來 觀察 和 體味，覺得 王 先生 的 話 是 金科玉律，一些 不錯 的。可是 近 幾天 來，國貨 工廠，如—華商 紗廠—勞方 忽因 要求 增加 工資，而 接 一連 二 的 發生 罷工 情事，這是 何等 愚昧 的 舉動！誠然：物價 的 騰貴，生活 的 壓迫—在 勞工 立 塲 上 說：出賣 汗血，所得 工資，不足以 維持 高度 的 生活，是 相當 地 艱苦 的，然而 在 資方 立 塲 上 說，歷年 能 在 不景氣 巨浪 裏，掙扎 過來 的，到 現在 獲得 復興 機會，稍稍 抬頭 的，也 不過 失之東隅，未必 能 全 收 桑 楡，僅僅 是 挖肉補瘡 而已！所以在 事實 擺 作 眼前 的 洋貨 侵略 未曾 消滅，洋貨 心理 未曾 打倒 的 時候，勞資 更 其要 步驟 一致 的 團結 起來，不容 分裂！罷工 是 自殺 的 行為，萬萬 不可 輕易 登 生 的，如果 勞方 有 合理 的 環境 上 的 要求，不妨 一面 工作，一面 請願，鎮靜 而 不 暴躁，守 秩序！守 紀律，資方 自然 解衣推食，有 衡情 的 補救 辦法 的，生產 不 間斷，攸關於 國貨 的 光明 前途，是非 淺鮮 的，薛光前 先生，在 復旦大學 演講 “意大利” 民族 的 能夠 復興！原因 是 在 ㊀ 嚴密 的 經濟 組織，㊁ 崇高 的 青年 訓練，關於 第一點，他說 “…… 譬如 紡織 一項，” 內部 可 分為 地質，選種，棉花，紡紗，織部，染料 等。工程師，機器 商，跟 消費者，都 打成 一片，…… 不合 標準 需要 時，他們 都 可 源源本本 的 去 推求 和 改進…… 調和 勞資 一項，在 一九二七年 也 公布 了 勞動 章，規定 工人 不准 罷工，工廠 不得 關閉，一切 糾紛，都 由 公會 調解…… 頓 使 國家 的 經濟 組織 也 鞏固 起來……“（見 十一月 八日 新聞報 茶話 欄）然則 勞資 合作，直接 關乎 國貨 工廠 的 本身，間接 更 關乎 國家 經濟 組織 的 健全，真是 何等 重大 啊！

### Review and Reflection

— Thin Qiu

— Am I to be considered Chinese? How quickly time passes!

The Shanghai Citizen's Use of National Products Year is about to bid farewell to us! As this Citizen's Use of National Products Year draws to a close, every compatriot should review and reflect on the work they have done to promote national products over the past year.

Let's start with the individual. We should think: Did we actually practice promoting and using national products this year? How much foreign goods did we buy this year? Were the foreign goods we bought necessary? Was there no national product that could replace them? If not, are we worthy of our compatriots? Are we worthy of our country? Then, from the individual, think of the family; from the family, think of the country. Conduct a detailed review and reflection on this year's national products movement.

Indeed, there is much to be gratified about in this year's Citizen's Use of National Products Year. Things like the invention of various national products, the improvement of various national products, and the enthusiastic use of national products by patriotic compatriots are all very gratifying to us. But what makes us sad is that the leakage [of money to foreign goods] is still in the hundreds of millions, especially for all kinds of consumables, entertainment products, and cosmetics. Things like shark fins and sea cucumbers, wireless radios, perfumes and powders, cold cream, snow powder, cosmetic jewelry, and tobacco and alcohol all have huge leakages. In the Year of National Products, there is still this phenomenon, which is truly a disgrace to the citizens of the Republic of China! Therefore, I hope that compatriots will carefully reflect on this. I remember that in the Capital's National Products Promotion Movement, there was such a slogan: Chinese people must use Chinese goods! Not using Chinese goods means not being Chinese. So, I dare to ask readers to think about it: Am I Chinese? Fellow compatriots! The national crisis is getting worse every day. Foreign aggression is becoming increasingly urgent. If we do not work practically to promote national products under these severe conditions, but continue to only sing high-sounding tunes, then the future of China can truly be described with the old saying "national demise is imminent"! I would like to request everyone here to make a great determination after reviewing and reflecting, and immediately start promoting national products.

### Visiting Families and Visiting Factories

— Wang Shu

This year, the Shanghai National Products Movement Joint Association is conducting two very meaningful tasks: One is to send female interviewers to visit housewives in various residential areas, carrying samples, and conducting on-the-spot promotion; the other is to send male interviewers to visit various national product factories to conduct practical investigations into production conditions. These two are of great significance in communicating the voices of both producers and consumers.

However, whether the work of the interviewers can proceed smoothly depends on the assistance of various parties. According to reports on the work of the female interviewers, it is known that a small number of housewives do not understand the meaning of the interview, and therefore there are perfunctory, disgust, refusal, and other obstacles. However, in general, all aspects, especially the opinion of the newspapers, have provided them with a lot of assistance, so their work is much more convenient than those visiting factories. As for the work of male interviewers, although it has not been reported in the newspapers, it is said that the difficulties they feel when visiting factories are even greater than those of the female interviewers. The crux of their problem is that they cannot obtain the understanding of the factory owners. Sometimes they are not allowed to visit smoothly, and even after the visit, they can only get a superficial outline. The factory owners are unwilling to clearly indicate all the actual production and sales conditions and economic situation. For the factory owners, of course, they have their reasons, but it is undeniable that they do not understand the mission of the interviewers, just like a few housewives.

In theory, visiting families and factories is equally important. The former can clarify the intentions of consumers and serve as a reference for improving production, while the latter can know the production situation of the factory and serve as a research on promotion skills and technology. The two complement each other and progress together, and there is no room for bias. However, all parties, especially national product factories that have a direct relationship, have many misunderstandings about the interviewers, and this attitude needs to be corrected. We should enable the work of the interviewers to proceed smoothly, because this is the most practical way to communicate the voices of production and sales.

### The Nanyang Islands and the National Products Market

— Shadow

The Nanyang Islands referred to here only include the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, the Malay Federation, Borneo, Annam, Myanmar, etc. According to recent surveys, there are as many as 6,155,000 overseas Chinese scattered on the various islands. Because most of the overseas Chinese are patriotic and willing to buy goods from their motherland, the Nanyang Islands are indeed a great market for national products. According to China's foreign trade statistics in recent years, exports to the Nanyang Islands are the largest. It can be seen that there is a vast market for national products there, and Chinese national product factories want national products to develop overseas. The first step should be to pay attention to finding ways to promote the sales of national products in the Nanyang Islands.

In recent years, the Nanyang region has attracted close attention from all countries in the world because of its fertile land and dense population, and is regarded as a great market. They try their best to export goods there for promotion. As a result, in the market of the Nanyang Islands, goods from various countries in the East and the West can be seen, and the competition between each other is also very fierce. This shows how important the commercial status of the Nanyang Islands is, and it is something we cannot ignore. Therefore, we hope that under the guidance of the authorities, national product factories can do their best to promote the national product market in Nanyang.

It is said that the annual import and export statistics of the above-mentioned islands reached 2,500,000,000 yuan for imports and 1,500,000,000 yuan for exports during the heyday. Since the entire world began to experience an economic downturn, the import and export statistics in Nanyang in recent years have also ranged from 900,000,000 yuan to 1,200,000,000 yuan. In this figure, China has also accounted for a lot in recent years, especially the national products exported by China, which are increasing year by year. From this, it can be seen that if national product factories can continue to find ways to promote the national product market in Nanyang in the future, then the future will certainly have considerable development.

It is undeniable that in recent years, because the entire world is experiencing an economic downturn, all countries have strongly resisted imported goods. For this reason, China, in European and American countries, can only supply a few raw materials, and all national product exports cannot occupy any position. Therefore, from the current environment, if you want national products to develop overseas, you can only first find a way out in Nanyang and seek development, and then further seek the market of various countries there.

As for the various methods we should adopt to promote the national product market in Nanyang, this is of course also a problem to be studied. In my opinion, in addition to studying the trade system, commodity substance, and strong assistance from bankers in the Nanyang market to enable national product factories to strongly promote sales in Nanyang; seeking contact with overseas Chinese merchants in Nanyang, often holding national product exhibitions overseas, and devoting efforts to various publicity efforts are all extremely important. In particular, it is hoped that the factory sector will select the best national products and transport them to Nanyang. If they are greedy for high profits and mix inferior goods into Nanyang, then the result will be the loss of confidence of overseas Chinese and even the loss of the entire national product market in Nanyang, which is a point that cannot be ignored!

### First-Class National Products

— Natural

In the past, there was a first-class cabinet, and now there are first-class national products. The so-called "first-class" means that the reputation is well-deserved, the most famous, the most valuable, the most worthy of adoption, and worthy of being in a leading position among general national products. It is not easy to obtain the reputation of being first-class for the same national product and the same product. It must take countless spirit, use countless power, undergo countless studies, and go through countless improvements. The knowledge, technology, and improvement efforts required in this process are unknown. After that, it can enjoy this good reputation, which is not accidental, let alone borrowed. It must be that the reputation is consistent with reality, and that it gains people's belief, then it can live in it without shame and use it without embarrassment. If the industrial sector wants to treat itself as first-class, everyone should encourage and motivate themselves with this, and if all national products can be labeled as first-class in the future, how can we imagine the progress of the national product industry at this time? It is up to people to make things happen, let us encourage each other.

Spring and Autumn

### War

— (Xiao Bai)

War is cruel and tragic.

War will destroy human civilization, destroy all material construction in society, turn lively cities into ruins, turn great buildings into ashes, and even cause the loss of life of thousands upon thousands of men, women, old and young.

However, the current world is being wholly plunged into the brewing of war and infighting, and a strong gunpowder smell has already filled the entire globe.

There are many ambitious people who are already displaying their power, openly or semi-openly slaughtering us weak, but in their mouths, they are singing the tune of "conquering barbarism, spreading civilization, and promoting royalism."

Therefore, we must never forget that only war for the survival of the motherland is the greatest and most glorious war of mankind, and only this war can enable mankind to rebuild the "temple of peace."

### Life

— Chen Liang

My house has only a door, no windows, and because I am afraid that the children will break in and make noise, even the door is closed. As for air and light, it is needless to say. Whether it is day or night, I always have to turn on the electric light, and my work and life are solved under the glaring electric light. When I rest, it is in the evening. I stroll on the street and see the sun. Although I feel more relaxed, what is presented in front of my eyes is still a picture of life. It often makes me come back with a depressed heart. One evening, I went out as usual. There were many people surrounding the entrance of a Chinese medicine store, and the children were especially energetic. Suddenly, a bird flew out of the crowd. It just flew to the ridge of the roof, and then flew back into the crowd. Because it went from darkness to a bright place, its eyes were a little dizzy. I couldn't see clearly what the bird was flying up and down. I squeezed up intentionally or unintentionally, and then I understood.

A middle-aged man wearing a melon-skin hat was standing in the crowd. His face was thin and dark, and his face was dull, probably not very proud. The palms of his hands were holding the pair of flying birds. His right hand pinched two bone pellets, and he kept waving his gestures to the bird. He threw a pellet into the air, and the bird swooped to the ground. He then threw the second pellet, and the bird held both pellets and flew back to the middle-aged man's hand and spat them out. Then he took out a few grains of shell from his pocket, and it bowed its head and pecked. Everyone watched with fascination, praising the bird's agility.

But I didn't have the intention to praise. This is a microcosm of life. The bird struggled to fly up and down, being driven by people, for only a few grains of grain. This trick was played four or five times, and the middle-aged man glanced at the crowd and said, "Whoever likes this bird can sell it cheaply. I'm embarrassed to play with it. Otherwise, I won't let it to others after I've practiced it myself. Who wants it, two silver dollars." He held the pair of birds in front of everyone.

There is another aspect of life in it. His words declare that he is not here to play tricks for people to watch, not a young master who is leisurely and boasting about his playthings in front of others. He hopes to obtain "two silver dollars" to fill his "embarrassment." However, what the crowd gave him was disappointment, disappointment. As for myself, even if I had two silver dollars, my house is not a place to raise birds and play with birds. Alas, life!

### Mo Xing

— Truth

After the cold north wind blows, women with coats put on their winter coats early, wrapping themselves in a posture that adapts to winter. Among them, the posture shown by wearing a black lamb fur style coat inside out seems to have a deeper impression on me.

I am not against women wearing black lamb fur coats; but every time I see a slender woman wrapped in that black lamb fur coat, I can't help but think of "Mo Xing"!

"Mo Xing" is the beloved dog of the German Moloch. He is completely different from the general foreign wolfhound. His figure is slightly taller than our country's Pekingese. And the fur on his whole body is simply like a black sheep. Many people will always associate it with the same spirit as the girl wearing a black lamb fur. Because Mo Dian not only has fur that is cute, but also has a gentle and docile spirit, which is obviously different from the general foreign hunting dogs with an outstanding posture. We all think this is a rare thing.

Mo Xing's owner spent several thousand yuan last year to transport him from Berlin to Nanjing. They usually spend day and night together, inseparable. When the weather is warm in summer, Mo and his fur are not very suitable for the hot sun. For the sake of cherishing him, the owner often asks a professional barber to cut his long hair. The price of each trimming is three yuan and five angles.

Mo Xing squatting on the ground can be counted as like a two-year-old child. He has no tail, and his head is covered with fluffy curly hair, which is even more beautiful. Every time I see Mo Xing, I always think of a woman wearing a black lamb fur coat; at the same time, every time I see a petite woman wearing a black lamb fur coat, I will never forget "Mo Xing"!

### The Secret of Pigeons

— Li Dabai

How can pigeons fly home from a long distance? This is a very common question, a very simple question. Anyone can answer this question.

The general answer is this:

Because the pigeon's eyes are particularly sharp, and its recognition and memory are extremely strong, so after being tamed, no matter how far it is placed, it can always fly back.

This explanation is the most common and is recognized by most people. At first glance, it seems very right and very reasonable. Therefore, anyone who buys pigeons must first choose the eyes of the pigeons. Good eyes are good pigeons, and bad eyes are bad pigeons. Pigeon keepers also distinguish the value of pigeons by the quality of their eyes. They cherish the ones with the best eyes the most.

In fact, this is only half the reason. The quality of the eyes can certainly determine the quality of the pigeons. However, this is only enough to determine the strength of the pigeon's memory and recognition.

Suppose you take a pigeon raised in Shanghai to Nanjing and release it. At such a long distance, its small eyes cannot see the scenery of Shanghai no matter what. No matter how clearly it recognizes the place where it was raised and how firmly it remembers it, it cannot recognize it hundreds of miles away. Therefore, some people think that pigeons must have other skills to fly home from such a long distance.

This is a secret of pigeons that no one can know.

Regarding the secret of pigeons, many scientists are very interested and are trying to study it intently. However, for many years, they have not been able to study it.

Now, some scientists have discovered that pigeons' bodies can generate a kind of radio wave. They believe that the semicircular grooves on the pigeons' ears, like radio receivers, can receive radio waves within a considerable distance. Based on this radio wave, the pigeon can fly home from that invisible distance.

And some scientists are studying pigeon's radio waves.

### The Teahouse Keeper of Suzhou

— De Lin

Since the teahouse is a good place for leisure, all kinds of typical people flock to it. After spending a dozen or so copper coins, you can drink a pot of fragrant tea to your heart's content. In addition to drinking tea, they hold a water pipe in their hands, light paper rolls, and smoke, which can further enhance their eloquence. Which family's snacks are long, which family's snacks are short, which family's wine tastes good, which family's wine tastes bad, which family's girl is pretty, which family's girl is beautiful, and they sometimes talk about national affairs there, but they are all irrelevant.

However, some teahouse keepers have side jobs, which is to raise birds in cages. Every morning and afternoon, they take the birds in the cages to their keeper's tea party. It is really leisurely. In the lonely and desolate back streets and alleys, the birds chirp and clamor with him, relieving his boredom on the road.

That's it. Tell the keepers, do you know that China is now suffering from the threat of foreign races, and the border is full of gunshots and gunpowder? The soldiers on the front line are fighting the enemy with their blood and flesh, risking their lives, so you must not be allowed to live on parasitically in a drunken dream. You must know that you are human beings, and life has a mission. Don't forget your mission. (End)

### The Mated Mandarin Ducks

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Episode 10 (Yellow Flowers Add Sorrow to Autumn Heart, Silk Handkerchief Expresses Tenderness, Strange Words Cast Errors)

Then he thought of the piece of paper he had left last time, perhaps he had some intention again. While thinking about this, he also saw the corner of the flower silk handkerchief exposed in the center drawer. After Aunt Liu left, he opened the drawer, and saw only the white silk handkerchief, with red and blue plaid flowers on it. He guessed that it was a woman's thing, and the very strong fragrance told him. Then he saw the note under the handkerchief very clearly. He picked it up and read it twice, and at first he didn't understand what it meant. Later, after thinking carefully, it was clear that he had seen the piece of paper he had written. What did it have to do with it? Why did he leave a handkerchief with such tender feelings? He probably still remembered the words on the note. The last sentence was where he expressed his attitude. He had said that he admired the person I admired, but he had never said a word to him. Didn't he think that it had nothing to do with him? He misunderstood himself, and he couldn't blame anyone. If others knew about it, it would inevitably cause trouble. Especially Jiang Menglan couldn't hear this news, and the friendship between each other would be completely ruined. But this misunderstanding was inconvenient to explain to Youmei. If he told him, wouldn't he be very embarrassed? Now he was hoping that he would help him to communicate with Menglan, and he had also joined this love network. This news could not let him know again. Otherwise, things would be more chaotic. Guoqi got such a piece of paper and a handkerchief, but it added a lot of trouble. Moreover, he lacked the courage to speak to women. If he continued to misunderstand day by day, what would he do in the future, if he continued to write letters like Menglan? Moreover, he could come to his house. Could he just tell him to his face that he didn't love him? Not only could he not bear to say it, but he was also embarrassed to say it. Moreover, he had this misunderstanding, and he might come more often, and I was afraid that his mother would also think things were suspicious. He thought about it for most of the day, but couldn't come up with a solution. The next day, he wanted to go out to avoid him, but he thought he couldn't avoid him, and he couldn't explain what he had misunderstood. He wanted to leave a letter in the drawer and let him read it himself? He thought again that after he read the letter, he would think that he was playing tricks on him and he would be angry? He couldn't solve this problem like yesterday. But this day passed completely, and Youmei never came. Finally, Guoqi prepared a lot of things to say to him, but it was all in vain. (125)

### Rao Song

— (Shen Li)

The cannon激奔thunder sword leaf霜, clustered cars woven troops wear helmets, ten thousand voices sing together 同仇 sentence,縱die 沙場 bones also fragrant.

Thousands of iron cavalry kicked ice over, the snow sea clamored and the waves surged, rushed into the battle to争先 sword slashing, the enemy's shadow in his eyes was no more.

The battle clouds were as dark as ink and pressed low on the sky, chasing the north and shouting slogans in unison, the rat-like sons fled and darted nimbly,床fully trampled into mud by horses' hooves.

Chopped straw filled the troughs and the Wan horses were fat, snowflakes flew over the desert head, and repeated turns and thrusts had no front enemy, vowing not to return without drinking the Yellow Dragon.

The majestic flags and drums crossed the Liao River, and another report came that the partial division had created the White Wave, and when I got up in the morning, the ink flowers stained the shield nose, clearly there were many victory books last night.

The comrades are now whipping north, writing about the remaining beacon smoke in several places, and rushing cars for half a day to gallop thousands of miles, half-binding the famous king to offer before the tent.

The armor and weapons stood 森森, chasing lightning and galloping, shining like fire like a lion's army, the generals examined hundreds of roads, and it was time to plow the court and sweep the holes.

The majestic lion roared to produce wind, sweeping away the evil spear at a glance, one word now asks the mad captives, who is the master of East Asia. (But pay)

### Tokyo Takarazuka Dance Spectacle

— Ji Yun

Before the European War, the Japanese, who were stingy even to eat a bowl of noodles in a Chinese restaurant, have changed greatly in recent years. The theater screen has been doing good business for several years. Taking Tokyo's Takarazuka as an example, it is enough to show that the Japanese have made a fortune and are far from what they used to be.

The main base of the Takarazuka Revue was originally in the suburbs of Osaka. Since the establishment of a music and dance theater in Tokyo, the business has been booming and has not declined to this day. The theatrical program is changed once a month, and it can always be full. The better seats in the center must be reserved on the day, so the drama that starts at 6:00 p.m. has long lines formed as early as 8:00 or 9:00 a.m. The seats in front must be purchased five or six days in advance. At the beginning and end of the performance, the door is full of spectators who want to see the real faces of the actors. Takarazuka is a public performance of a dance school, and all the students are girls. Logically, Takarazuka enthusiasts should be men, but the opposite is true. Japanese modern girls who are Europeanized are called Takarazuka faction "Takarazuka Party", and they are all infatuated with Takarazuka stars. It is said that countless girls have died for Kazuko Hara. At least two-thirds of the seats in Takarazuka are women, and the most noticeable is a group of female students wearing uniforms.

Except for Sundays and holidays, there is only one performance a day, which is the slogan of the founder of Takarazuka, "Entertainment does not hinder business." The price ranges from half a yuan to two yuan, which is very suitable for the taste of the middle class. Therefore, middle school students can save their weekly allowance and enjoy themselves once. The Takarazuka building has only four floors. The top floor is a cafeteria and shop, which is attached with a library and a small theater for children, which is composed of paintings and loudspeakers. After the main musical is over, there is a 30-minute break. The audience can go out to rest, buy things, smoke, or drink tea at will. It remedies the disadvantage of sitting and listening to the construction of the scenery. However, the rest area must be large enough to accommodate them. Each floor has an exhibition to attract the audience, and also serves as an advertisement.

Performing old-style Japanese dramas is also improved to become musicals. However, the narration and acting still do not escape the old-style drama. The new-style song and dance are completely influenced by European and American song and dance movies, and are completely Europeanized. In the Japanese used, English is still mixed from time to time. The script is also based on foreign masterpieces, so even the names of the characters in the play are in Western languages. Although the architecture is not very gorgeous, the singing is very clear. The costumes, decorations, electric lights, and scenery are all top-notch. The number of actors is also large, and there are often fifty or sixty dancers and singers, which is unique in East Asia. However, there is still no improvement or creation in the song and dance itself. This is the result of excessively catering to the psychology of the audience.

Audiences on the third floor can rent a telescope, which is convenient for many people with nearsightedness. If you unfortunately encounter rain on the way home, you can also rent an umbrella to go home, which shows the thoughtfulness of the design. Japanese people often despise the American people's love of singing, dancing, wine, and women, but they have forgotten that they have also embarked on the road of enjoyment.

### The Shaanxi Rebellion is Not Difficult to Resolve Peacefully

— I

Since Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek escaped from danger in the Xi'an Incident and returned to Nanjing safely, people generally speculated that the aftermath problem would be easily solved and no other problems would occur. Unexpectedly, although Zhang Xueliang came to Nanjing with Generalissimo Chiang, Yang Hucheng defied orders with his troops, entrenched himself, and has continued for more than ten days. The situation is serious, and there is no hope of a peaceful resolution. This is really beyond our expectations.

However, in my opinion, this matter is not difficult to resolve smoothly. There are two reasons: ㊀ In Shaanxi, assuming the situation is serious and there is absolute ambition, it must have been more difficult for Generalissimo Chiang to escape from danger. Now that Generalissimo Chiang has arrived in Nanjing safely and is recuperating, Yang Hucheng's defiance of the central government's orders and his turmoil has made this behavior seem inconsistent with what came before. Therefore, I expect it to be easy to resolve, firstly. ㊁ What is the current situation in our country? Although Bailingmiao has been conquered, the situation on the border of Suiyuan is still very serious. As a soldier, Yang Hucheng must understand the responsibility of defending the country. Now, Yang Hucheng is not only not resisting the enemy, but also trying to disrupt the rear, which is not only intolerable by his own conscience, but also cannot be forgiven by the people of the country.

Therefore, what is the purpose of Yang Hucheng's rise in the Northwest? Although it is still unknown, I only hope that the central government will be generous, explain the great righteousness, and clarify the advantages and disadvantages, so that these simple-minded soldiers will suddenly realize and obey obediently. Then, our country's strength will not only not be lost at all, but will also be able to make them serve on the frontier and redeem their past mistakes. This is what the people of our country are praying for.

In the event that the central government explains the great righteousness and clarifies the blessings and misfortunes, but they still cling to their evil ways and resist the order to the end, then these domineering and unteachable soldiers have been abandoned by the people of the country, and it will be easy for the national army to suppress them. It is just a matter of time. Therefore, I hope that this matter will be resolved as soon as possible. In the event of a delay, this kind of army will take risks, be used by the Communist Party, or collude with foreign races, and it will be more difficult to eradicate them.

### On the Dock

— Ping Jun

After the ×× class small steamer left, the dock became deserted.

The small steamer sailed in the middle of the river, laboriously towing two civilian boats, sticking out its narrow chest, and dividing the tender and beautiful river surface. Thus, the calm river water was stirred up with two tiny waves, spreading one by one, and finally, it slammed the weak and annoyed waves against the embankment, but the cold face of the embankment made it fail. Again and again, they retreated with tears-like white foam.

... Gradually, even the blurred shadow of the ferry disappeared.

I was thinking intently that every victim should use a powerful and solid resistance to inflict the shame of frustration on his opponent...

Lin Fugang, with a pipe (old gun), walked over from the intersection with the clumsy steps of a mother duck.

"Are you thinking of throwing yourself into the river, you bastard?" He showed a mouthful of tobacco-stained teeth, each tooth corroded by poison, and the seams were still full of dirty black traces of quinine.

I turned my head to face the river while feeling nauseous and said:

"Death is not a fact that can be avoided. Chronic suicide is not necessarily wiser than acute suicide. Moreover, putting precious life on worthless waste, it seems that 'the meaning of man' is definitely not that simple."

His liver-colored cheeks turned red•——Purple with red, it is another kind of charm. However, I think his blushing is definitely not because of shame. A person who knows shame will not have his spirit going downhill.

"It's bad luck to meet you, a 'rebellious guy', brother. Lao Bao told you that you are very dangerous,...um, very dangerous...it's easy to offend friends! A person will lonely end his life." While speaking, his emotions were very anxious, often saying repetitive words, a bit stuttering. "Do you think loneliness is terrible?"

"What do you mean by what you said?" I felt strange about Lin's pipe's question.

"I said that I'm afraid there are only two of us Cantonese here." He shrugged his thin shoulders and said with a cordial smile.

"Could it be that the locals will eat people?——Even if they eat people, they have to pick the ones with meat."

"Damn you 'light bulb' (a guy who doesn't know what's going on)..." He showed his black teeth again.

So, I laughed victoriously.

The river is now flowing slowly, as if it has felt that all struggles that disregard oneself are superfluous and futile. Quietly, it makes a light and subtle, sigh-like low singing.

The ancient city wall lazily stretches its embrace, inside which stands a pagoda that once had glorious days in history. The red light of the late afternoon sun is staring at the top of the pagoda. ...

All the noise of the ancient city is now silent.

I leaned my body leaning against the railing on the dock a little, I thought, maybe this way I can hear the river's melancholy sigh.

But, Lin Fugang shook my back with his thin, bone-thin palm. And then continued slowly:

"Look, how free and happy that thing is, flying without any worries..."

At this time, a vigorous and steady goshawk is circling

## Page 20

circling around the top of the tower. Under the intimidation of the goshawk's emphasized arrogance, the ancient tower drooped its head decadently. Moreover, against the huge and dark shadow of the city wall, a kind of sadness in the late afternoon easily rises from people's hearts.

On the dock, the passengers catching the last boat gradually gathered a few more. Three vagrant soldiers leaned against the railing and chatted loudly. One of them, short and with a fierce light in his eyes, spat a mouthful of phlegm on the river and said:

"×× Town is really a good place."

"………Three years, um………I have been away from that place for a full..." The soldier with a parrot-like face answered dreamily.

Suddenly, a beautiful and flirtatious face appeared in the crowd.

Lin's pipe's eyes chased after it.

"That guy is not a good road, I have seen too much of it here on the dock. Once, before getting on the boat, she was whispering in the ear of an old man, and the last time I went to ×× town, I saw her again with a man she didn't know when boarding the boat. They started chatting at first, and when they went ashore, they went arm in arm (meaning walking arm in arm)."

"A prostitute?" Lin's pipe asked me back. Then: "Damn it, the people of Jiangnan have no wife to tie their hair when they are alive, and no burial place when they die——"

"Some of the women in ×× Town have prostitute-like behaviors." I said.

"Under a sound social system, the existence of prostitutes can be considered a shameful thing!"

Lin Fugang slightly raised his head and said in a deep tone.

I turned my eyes again to the goshawk circling around the top of the tower. The vast and boundless dark blue sky sets off a lively, free, and happy black shadow. How I yearn for and love it. So, I sighed.

### Anecdotes from the Back Building

— Nie Jun

The son of the family in the back building died after being ill for more than ten days. The husband is a casual carpenter. He goes to the foreman's house every day to ask about business. He has a day's work to do only when the foreman takes over a "contract" or other foremen lack manpower. Recently, the foreman has taken over a "contract" to build an ancestral hall. It is said that it is a descendant of a wealthy gentleman who is building a very grand and magnificent ancestral temple for his ancestors. Everything is designed by experts and skilled workers, and it is expected to be completed in six months. This business is more beneficial than building a house, because a house is for living people, and in addition to the beautiful appearance, it must also be considered strong and durable. Building an ancestral hall is not like this. The content can be increased or decreased at will, as long as the appearance is magnificent. That's what the descendants originally meant. If the newly built ancestral hall adds a scenic spot to the local area, it will be satisfactory! The foreman can indeed sit back and eat for several years on this business. Those casual workers seem to see the benefits, and there is no need to worry about whether there will be work to do tomorrow for six months. What they fear most is running to the foreman's house every day for nothing.

The casual carpenter in the back building had a son a month ago. He already has five daughters, but the son is the first. Usually, when there is no work to do, the carpenter often gets drunk and scolds people. He doesn't complain about not having work to do, but scolds his wife as a "white tiger spirit", saying that she has been unlucky since she entered the door, and that she has raised those "money-losing goods" one after another. The woman seems to be used to this. She always rushes to do things and doesn't say a word, or she simply doesn't listen; because we who live in the front building know what he is going to say as long as the craftsman gets drunk.

After raising a son, there was a period of quiet. Even if there was no work to do, he would hug the child, quite like a father. My wife once said with emotion: I don't know when it will be possible to break the habit of valuing men over women in China? Not to mention the rich, they are afraid that so much money will be wasted after death. Just like the carpenter who is so poor that he scolds his wife as a white tiger spirit when he has no work to do, he also values his son so much. It seems that he has food to eat when he has a son!

My wife's emotion was fulfilled. A month after giving birth to a son, the craftsman had six months of work to do. Now he is drinking again, naturally drunk every time, but he praised his wife's belly for being good: "When the time comes, good luck comes, raising a son brings ingots!" A son really dominates the joys and sorrows of their family, although the wife still doesn't say a word; she now has more things to do with the child.

However, good times do not last long, and this situation only lasted for more than a month. The precious son fell ill, and it looked very dangerous. He cried all day long, and he also asked a doctor. The doctor didn't know what he said, but after four or five days, the back building was almost like a fire, with loud crying and shouting, and even the neighbors secretly came to the back door to ask. The carpenter was probably eager to love his son, or he was planning to raise money to treat his son, and he didn't want to go to work even if he had a good job. That rough voice stayed in the back building as if it was a clown on the stage. He would shut his mouth and not say a word even if his wife scolded him a few times.

The son finally died after being ill for more than ten days. It was not dawn when he died. I heard clearly that the back building burned a few small clothes. The couple was silent and did not say a word. The oldest "money-losing goods" was crying for her brother, but she was crying very sadly.

At noon, the carpenter invited a friend to carry the small coffin out. I just met him at the alley, and he walked as fast as usual, as if the one who died was not his son.

The back building is quiet again, they are all recalling that nightmare! The next day, the husband went to work, but that was really bad news. Another carpenter had replaced him in his job. The foreman's reason was also very sufficient. They signed a contract to deliver the goods within a time limit. If you don't come to do it, he will do it.

Naturally, the "white tiger spirit" broke out again, and the sound of a glass thing being smashed was heard. This time, the wife replied: "Poverty is always poverty in life. The white tiger spirit also gave you a son. Can you afford it, you poor ghost, really never ending debt collectors!"

A "money-losing goods" suddenly cried out in a hoarse voice, probably because the woman grabbed her to vent her anger.

Movies

### Soviet Documentary "Abyssinia"

The war to seize colonies that took place in Abyssinia was carried out in the name of "spreading civilization", but the brutal lessons of airplanes and cannons will never be forgotten by the invaded.

And the film "Abyssinia" is an even better memorandum.

This film was shot by the Soviet Film News Factory special correspondent accompanying the army of Abyssinia on the front line. It fully explains what the fascists called "spreading civilization", exposes the true face of the invaders, and records the cruelty of conquering the natives of the colony. And from the correct point of view, the film repeatedly shows how the invaded used all their strength to resist the enemy as much as possible, not to submit, not to fear difficulties, and to fight for the independence of their motherland.

This Soviet documentary will be shown publicly at the Shanghai Grand Theater.

### Interview with "Amateur Actors"

Performing at the Carlton starting the 24th of this month

Almost every day is an all-nighter. They and she are not tired at all and don't want to rest. The whole house is about to be torn down and burned by their passionate spirits.

Upstairs and downstairs, they are doing their final rehearsals. Shen Xiling stands solemnly like a military instructor, staring intently at each actor and shouting sternly: "All ready!" The air is so tense. Li Lin begins to feel emotional, his voice sounding like he's about to cry. "Not enough, not enough emotion! The sound must be audible at least fifty rows of seats away!" Shen Xiling shouts like this, and Zhao Dan says from the side: "Z. G."

So, they do it again.

Here are Junli and Lan Ping, Lü Ban and Ye Luxi, they are two couples of joy and sorrow. As soon as Lan Ping sees Junli, she almost cries. As for Lü Ban, he is holding a guitar, dressed in Cossack attire, and singing Russian-style songs in a drawn-out voice. His lover Ye Luxi arrives, and he immediately embraces her, "Haha!" Lü Ban laughs again, showing a triumphant look.

The director, Zhang Min, sits silently on the side, calmly observing everyone's movements and postures.

That's another room, with a group of young people, they are planning the editing of the commemorative special issue, developing photos, and drawing posters, so busy that they don't have a moment to stop.

Tang Na and Yi Ming are also busy distributing paper to everyone to sign and write a commemorative message for this performance, because it will be published in the commemorative special issue.

Yuan Muzhi: Theater is my maiden home, and film is my husband's home. I haven't returned since marrying two years ago. I can't stay for long in this busy schedule, so I'll wait for spring. (General meaning)

Zheng Junli – Now we need a big thunderstorm.

Zhao Dan – I give my life to the stage.

Lan Ping – I want to be Desha, not Katerina.

Ouyang Yuqian – One performance is one performance.

There are also witty remarks from many other actors such as Shen Xiling, Ying Yin, Shu Xiuwen, Lü Ban, Wei Heling, Gu Er'yi, Shi Chao, Wu Mei, etc., which will be explored and published in detail later.

This large-scale performance is being run by them with collective effort. The commemorative special issue of the performance is about to be published, and the content is very exciting and rich, with ten pages of copperplate illustrations, finely printed photos of all the actors and stills from the play. The text is written by Zhao Jingshen, Lini, Linna, Chen Baichen, Huangmei, Shen Xiling, Tong Min, Ying Yunwei, Song Zhi'de, Ouyang Yuqian, etc., as well as commemorative messages from all the actors.

Automobile Special Issue

### New 1937 Studebaker Arrives in Shanghai

— Fu

New 1937 Studebaker automobile. It has now arrived by sea. The Yuantong Automobile Company, Studebaker dealer at No. 1 Mu Bu Yabei Road, is currently unboxing it. It will soon be displayed in the showroom for public viewing. In terms of basic aspects, the new car does not have much difference compared to the 1936 model. However, in terms of aesthetics, safety, economy, and utility, the various new inventions and features of the new car have reached their peak, truly surpassing previous products. The new car is divided into two groups: the President series and the Commander series. The great progress in mechanical engineering of the President series is numerous. Among them, the automatic shift selection is the most remarkable. It can be used at any speed above 35 miles per hour.

The special rear axle is another significant feature of the Studebaker President and Commander series new cars. Its gear design is between helical bevel gears and worm gears, making it the most effective gear combination. Because the new car is equipped with this type of rear axle, the rear floor of the car can be lower without sacrificing ground clearance. The floor near the car door is three and sixteen-hundredths inches lower, greatly increasing the height of the door without increasing the overall height of the car. One of the reasons why the interior of the new car is spacious and comfortable, making it easy to get in and out, is the use of this type of rear axle.

The new-style double-drop frame is another advancement of the 1937 Studebaker. Its strength and solidity are even greater than the 1936 model. The new shock absorbers on the new car are integrated with the chassis, unlike ordinary ones that are merely an additional accessory. The new shock absorbers are not nailed to the frame, nor are they connected to the axles, making them so-called direct-acting. Their structure is extremely compact, and automatic temperature controllers, etc., are all included.

In terms of driving management, the new Studebaker is handy and easy to operate, something that older models could not hope to achieve. The reason for this is that the new car is equipped with the latest dual-rod steering wheel. This compound steering wheel has an excellent design and a simple structure. It makes parking and turning more convenient, and it also allows for easier control over the speed of the car, allowing drivers to fully enjoy the pleasure of driving. Its mechanical strength and resistance to road shocks have been greatly increased, and its lifespan has also been extended due to the reduced need for frequent inspections.

The generator equipped on the Studebaker President series new car is equipped with an automatic current and voltage regulator, so the battery can be fully charged regardless of the car's speed, and there is no risk of overcharging under any driving conditions. All new cars, whether President series or Commander series, are equipped with Fuller's oil and motor purifiers, so the oil generally does not need to be changed except for seasonal changes. The well-known Studebaker choke has been further improved and simplified, making it easier than before to perform timely inspections. The new choke has three calibration methods that can be adjusted according to the different carbon content of the motor fuel. This adjustment method is not only mastered by any repairman, but any driver can easily understand and master it in three to five minutes.

The 1937 Studebaker Commander series new car is equipped with rubber-insulated free joints, so its drive is smooth and the moving parts are not subject to corrosion, and there is no need for lubrication. The fact that the Studebaker new car is extremely smooth and quiet at high speeds is greatly related to this device. All new cars are also equipped with special starter clutches, so even in the cold winter, it is very easy to start. Once cranked, it can naturally continue until the engine starts.

Another change in the chassis of the new car is the position of the parking brake lever, which is located just below the dashboard on the left side of the steering wheel. It is more convenient for the driver to operate directly. As for the floor of the front compartment, clutter is eliminated and the space is wider, making it extremely convenient to enter and exit from the left door. Furthermore, both Studebaker series new cars are equipped with new-style harmonic gears, making shifting effortless and very flexible. Other features, such as automatic hill hold, which was first created by Studebaker last year as a safety feature, are still used on the 1927 series new cars. The engines of the new cars have been improved, making them more refined due to the reforms to the main bearings, engine rubber brackets, and crankshaft balance, so their smoothness and quietness are beyond what has been achieved in the past.

▲A car assembled from leftover parts. A man named Peng Pulaisidong in Huichi Tai, Gansas State, USA, used the leftover parts from 25 cars damaged in car accident cases to assemble the car in the left picture. These 25 damaged cars sacrificed the lives of 37 people. Some parts of this pieced-together car came from cars used by bandits and destroyed during police chases.

▲British cars modify windshields. The British Department of Transportation stipulates that from January 1st, all windshields or front windows of cars should be replaced with safety glass to reduce danger. This regulation does not apply to the front windows of the upper level of double-decker buses. The Department of Transportation's regulations regarding the use of safety glass require that all new cars manufactured after January 1, 1932, must have windshields and front windows made of safety glass. However, for cars already in use, there is a mandatory deadline of January 1, 1937, to replace them. According to estimates by the Automobile Manufacturers Association, approximately 300,000 privately owned cars and 200,000 freight cars currently in use are not equipped with safety glass. Therefore, after this regulation is implemented next month, 500,000 car owners will be affected. However, it is said that the installation procedure for this type of glass is quite fast, requiring only a few hours. The price is approximately £2 to £3.

▲Nuffield donates funds to build a church. Over the years, the expansion of the British Morris car factory has led to a gradual increase in the population of Cowley Village, where the workers live. When the Morris factory was first established, its population was only over 200. Today, it has jumped to 25,000. The original church in the area was sufficient when there were few residents. However, today, due to the large number of listeners, it cannot accommodate everyone on Sundays. Many latecomers are turned away. Lord Nuffield, the owner of Morris, has donated £35,000 to build two more large-scale churches.

▲Estimated freight car production. According to Mr. Baike, the sales director of the Freight Car and Commercial Vehicle Communication Group of the Chrysler Automobile Company, the total number of freight cars produced and sold in the United States this year will reach 830,000, an increase of 20% compared to 1936. Mr. Baike also said that the production volume in the last three months of 1935 was 180,000 units. If this number is increased by 20%, the production volume for the same quarter this year could reach 216,000 units. Adding this number to the already estimated 618,000 units, the freight car volume for the entire year could reach approximately 834,000 units. Isn't 830,000 units more than enough?

▲Hettison's amazing exhibition. At the auto show held in New York this time, Hettison and Toula Ping had two amazing exhibitions that were highly praised by visitors. They were called "Indoor Driving" and "Self-Talking Car." For the first item, a huge glass movie screen was set up indoors. Visitors sitting in front of this screen would see the scenery of the road reflected on the screen, as if they were driving in the suburbs. At this time, the "driver" could use the "movie" to change gears according to the different road scenes.

The second item, "Automatic Speaking Car," when visitors stepped into this car, they would hear a voice coming from somewhere in the car. However, the tone was directed at them. And sometimes it could call the visitor's name, and then explain the features of the new car in great detail. The guests did not feel that it was verbose.

▲Factories rush to manufacture new cars day and night. After the New York Auto Show closed, factories rushed to deliver orders. Therefore, around mid-November, factories began working day and night in order to meet the market demand in time. Buick's production has reached its highest production capacity due to the urgent need for retail sales. The factory's production volume for December has been set at 28,000 units. Friday, December 6th, saw a total production volume of 1,333 units, of which 1,061 were domestic orders. In addition, there were still 56,123 outstanding orders. According to Buick CEO, Koudishi, the estimated production volume for Buick in 1937 is 247,000 units. Chevrolet new cars are also being manufactured because of the high market demand. In mid-November, the daily production of cars had already increased fivefold to 5,000 units. However, because it was not enough to meet the demand, it was further increased to 6,000 units per day. Nash new cars have received 24,000 orders after being exhibited at the New York Auto Show and other places for two days. Since then, the number of orders has continued to increase. The factory is also rushing to manufacture cars in order to adapt to the environment.

▲Chevrolet wins first choice again. According to the regulations of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, at each auto show, the manufacturer whose products have the greatest value in terms of sales has the priority to choose the venue first. At this year's New York Auto Show, this right was again won by Chevrolet. This is because the Chevrolet model for this year has sold 1,125,000 units, and it has once again won the first choice. Chevrolet has been the manufacturer with the largest annual car sales for the seventh time in the past ten years.

Automobile driving safety campaigns are receiving a great deal of attention from municipal authorities in Europe and the United States. The city of Chicago in the United States has recently established two automobile driving experiment grounds specifically for teaching the public safe automobile driving techniques. The equipment in each is very complete. Furthermore, many senior schools are now making automobile driving methods a required course. As shown in the picture, this is one corner of the classroom. The students' desks are all shaped like driving steering wheels.

### Detroit City Orders Ford Large Long-Distance Buses

The Detroit city street railway recently ordered 500 Ford V-8 city buses from the Ford Motor Company. Purchasing so many buses at once is truly the first large order of its kind in the entire United States.

The delivery deadline is within ninety days, with the last of these 500 vehicles being handed over to the railway company next spring. These vehicles are new-style buses that can accommodate 25 people, designed by the Ford Motor Company in consultation with Detroit Street Railway engineers. The aim is to provide a most modern vehicle for low-cost, high-speed operation in the city's most congested traffic areas.

The railway company's management has had a total of 331 Ford V-8 buses running on Detroit's busiest roads for the past two years. The large-scale purchase of new-style buses this time was decided after careful inspection of the past. The mileage of the existing Ford V-8 buses is increasing day by day and month by month, with the total monthly mileage exceeding one million miles. The first bus has already traveled more than 120,000 miles.

Detroit is the center of the entire diamond car industry, so this transaction is a practical compliment to the manufacturers of Ford cars and trucks.
