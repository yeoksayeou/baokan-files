### Fierce Battle in the Suburbs of Wuxi, Our Troops Firmly Defend the Key Fortress of Wangyin

Changxing is in Peril, Our Reinforcements Gather to Block the Enemy Tightly, Xiaoshi and Hailin Remain Unchanged, Yixing is Safe

Regarding the war situation on various fronts yesterday, the main forces of both sides are still on both sides of Taihu Lake and north of it. The situations in Changxing and Wuxi are both extremely urgent. The news obtained by this newspaper from various sources is recorded as follows: ㊀ The Japanese army has been fiercely attacking Wuxi on two routes for days, attempting to break through the Jiangyin-Wuxi line. One route is advancing along the Changshu-Wuxi-Shanghai Highway, and the other is attacking from the front of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway line. Because our army's defense on the railway line is solid, Zhoujingxiang has been gained and lost multiple times. The fighting on the highway line is particularly fierce. Our army's position in Dongting Town was once breached, and a small detachment of Japanese troops advanced to the suburbs of the North Gate. There is also a rumor that they have broken into the city, but it has not been verified. A unprecedented fierce battle has already occurred in the suburbs of the North Gate, and our army is making heroic sacrifices. Japanese artillery is bombarding the city fiercely, and a major fire has broken out. On the front of the railway line, our army is still holding the east of the station and the west of Zhoujingxiang. A large number of our fresh troops have gone to the front line to reinforce. The Jiangyin Fortress remains unshaken. Our troops in Duanshan continue to exchange heavy artillery fire with Japanese warships, and the artillery battle is extremely fierce. Even if there is a change in Wuxi, our army's line of Jiangyin and Wujin remains extremely solid. ㊁ After our army moved west from Wuxing on the south bank of Taihu Lake, the Japanese army's attack on Changxing became very urgent. Fierce battles are unfolding on the highway line. Although the situation in Changxing is very critical, it is still under our army's firm defense. Our army is occupying the high ground on both sides of the highway, relying on its solidity to defend. The battle is currently taking place in the area of Hengshan and Lushan. Our rear fresh troops have rushed to join the front line to meet the enemy, so the Yixing area is still safe to this day. On the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, due to the impact of Wuxing, our troops in Tongxiang have retreated slightly. East of Shimen and Chongde, the two armies are currently engaged in fierce fighting in Shuotou Town. The Xiaoshi-Hailin line has not changed and remains a strong line of defense in a straight line with the Changxing line.

[Nanjing] This morning, six Japanese planes bombed Danyang. At 2:00 PM, Zhenjiang was also attacked. The extent of the damage in both places is currently unknown. According to Chinese sources, the Japanese planes were driven away by Chinese aircraft. (Reuters, 27th)

### Japanese Artillery Bombards the Coast of Jingjiang

Our left wing, the Chengjin line, firmly defends the Jiangyin Fort. The Japanese army's all-out attack from the sea, land, and air has lasted for five days and nights. Yesterday, a portion of the Japanese warships anchored in the Yangtze River shifted their artillery fire to the north bank, fiercely bombarding the Jingjiang coastal area, causing the situation in Jingjiang to become quite critical. Currently, all residents of Jingjiang City have been evacuated. Large numbers of Japanese planes have been bombing the area for days, causing heavy damage to civilian houses. Traffic from Nantong Tianshenggang to Jingjiang has almost been cut off. Although there are still a few small cars and rickshaws that can pass, the fare for each trip is as high as ten or more yuan, and the journey is very dangerous. If the Japanese army lands in Jingjiang, it will soon advance on Qinxing, Yangzhou, and Chaoshuang, threatening the rear of Zhenjiang. Therefore, our army has made strict defenses in that area.

### Isolated Troops Defend Wuxing City to the Death

On the Wuxing side of the south bank of Taihu Lake, our army has painfully retreated and moved west due to being attacked from the flanks. It is gathering fresh troops to try to counterattack. Currently, there are still three regiments of isolated troops in Wuxing City, firmly defending the Zhongshan Hall, Security Headquarters, Sanyuan Cave Mansion, Wang Family Ancestral Hall, Jade Emperor Palace, and Clothing Guild Hall, fighting bravely. The three regimental commanders, Tao Fengwei, Xu Junruo, and Tao Jianfang, have sent out wireless telegrams stating that they will only withdraw after inflicting considerable losses on the Japanese army and after that place becomes impossible to defend.

### Japanese Army Supplies are Transported Busily

Yesterday, Japanese transport ships Mexico Maru, Yoshino Maru, and Tamatsu Maru, etc., arrived from Japan and successively entered the Huangpu River at 9:00 AM, berthing at Osaka Wharf and Huangpu Wharf. Each ship also carried a batch of reinforcements dispatched from that country to Shanghai, totaling about 1,700 to 1,800 men, all army soldiers wearing yellow woolen uniforms. They disembarked at those two wharves at that time. Subsequently, a communications and telecommunications ship named "Okinawa Maru" was also transferred to Shanghai for military use. At the same time, four freighters, including the Keijin Maru and Kaihei Maru, etc., continued to enter the port. Each ship also transported a large number of military equipment, ammunition, bamboo rafts, and mechanized canvas bridges, rubber dinghies, etc., to Shanghai. The ships then berthed at the Zhongzhan and Huazhan of the Shaoshang Bureau and immediately began unloading the military supplies and military materials they had brought. That night, the ships would carry wounded soldiers back to their country. All the bridges, bamboo rafts, and sampans that were transported will be transferred to the front line for use in the area where rivers are prevalent.

Yesterday, six or seven small steamships flying Japanese flags towed barges, fully loaded with soldiers, about a thousand men, and also loaded with a large amount of military food, vegetables, and miscellaneous items, heading west along the Suzhou River to the front line.

Yesterday at 9:30 AM, a Japanese motorboat in the Huangpu River, towed two large barges, full of Tibetan bags, wooden boxes, bullets, and rations, etc., passed through the Waibaidu Bridge and headed west on the Suzhou River. Before long, another motorboat of the same type, also towing two fire barges and a small empty boat, while the large barges were full of Japanese naval landing force soldiers, about two or three hundred men, and many other equipment and military supplies. The small empty boat at the end seemed to be prepared to transport the towed people to the front line by small empty boats, all speeding west along the Suzhou River.

### Foreigners Believe That the Establishment of a Safe Zone in Nanjing is Increasingly Urgent

Civilian Casualties Would Be Extremely Heavy Once Attacked, Most Shops in Nanjing are Now Closed, English侨 Residential Houses are Pasted with Chinese and English Strips

[Nanjing] Most of the shops in Nanjing are closed, and the shopkeepers are also in trouble. Only a few shops selling food have not closed, but the stock is gradually decreasing, and what remains are expensive canned foods and foreign wines that are sold at a premium. Taiping Road, the main shopping district in Nanjing, now presents a desolate appearance. Usually, pedestrians and vehicles are constantly flowing, but now it is almost an empty street. Goods are piled up on the Jiangbian wharf in Xiaguan, and refugees are also gathering here, all wanting to take a boat upstream as soon as possible. Armed police officers, in order to facilitate loading goods onto the ship, do not allow refugees to crowd onto the ship. Today, there was no air raid alarm heard here. (Reuters, 27th)

[Nanjing] The doors of the residential houses of English nationals in Nanjing are now all affixed with strips printed in Chinese and English, stating that this is English property and others must not interfere, etc. (Reuters, 27th)

[Nanjing] The fate of the plan to establish a safe zone in Nanjing is still uncertain. Priests and other foreigners here all believe that this issue is becoming increasingly urgent because if the Japanese army succeeds in peeking into Wuhu, the rear route of Nanjing will be cut off. Once Nanjing is isolated and attacked, civilian lives may be lost extremely heavily. Although many residents of Nanjing have left the country, observers estimate that there are still 300,000 people. Ordinary means of transportation can transport 10,000 residents out of the city every day, and many people can cross the river to other suitable places. However, if the safe zone can be realized, it can accommodate 200,000 refugees. Although the Chinese authorities have said that they will not fight in the city, if the retreating army is forced into the city, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no war and the destruction of Nanjing.

### Japanese Warships Occupy Gaolan Island, Zhongshan, Along the Coast of Guangdong

Nearby Small Islands are Also in Imminent Danger

Guangzhou Correspondence: Japanese warships have recently been increasing along the coast of Guangdong Province. The cruiser outside Humen sailed to Hebao Island on the 14th to replenish food and returned to the Dashan Pass waters outside Humen on the 16th, monitoring our ships entering the Pearl River Estuary. There have recently been two Japanese warships in the Chaoyang waters and four Japanese warships in the Aotou waters of Huiyang. The Japanese warships in Chaoyang sent several small boats full of Japanese sailors straight to Guanao Market on the 12th of the month, attempting to land, but were met by our defense forces. The Japanese ships turned away when they saw that we were prepared. It is heard that the Japanese soldiers intended to steal across Guanao in an attempt to contain our Chaoshan defense forces. The Japanese warships in the Aotou waters are very erratic. Although they have repeatedly tried to land in the Dapeng Bay area, they are afraid of being intercepted by our defense forces and have not dared to act yet. On the 17th, they first sent two planes to Reconnoiter over Pinghai, Longgang, and Huiyang to explore the reality of our defenses. Tangjiawan, Zhongshan County, is adjacent to Lingdingyang, with a very long coastline. The islands are scattered like stars, with supplies. The Japanese warships have long regarded it as a must-contend place. As soon as the Japanese fleet went south, it first occupied Hebao Island opposite the bay, engaged in the development of a land-based airfield to serve as an air force base to control Guangdong and Hong Kong. On the 7th of this month, Tangjiawan added seven or eight Japanese warships and then sent ships to explore the islands, occupying those that were considered usable for military purposes. After the exploration, Gaolan Island in the sixth district of Zhongshan County was found to be the most suitable. The island is isolated in the sea, and the ground has small hills that can block the sea breeze. The island is quite densely populated, with about several villages and more than a hundred shops and residential houses. Most of the residents are engaged in fishing. Therefore, on the 10th, the Japanese warships sent five small steamships full of about 300 sailors, covered by a warship, to Gaolan Island and forcibly landed at about 6:00 AM. The residents of the island were awakened from their dreams by the sound of guns and cannons. The local militia, about dozens of people, immediately took up arms to block and attack. (There is no army stationed there.) For a time, the sound of guns and cannons was dense. More than 30 Japanese sailors were killed, and the militia also suffered many casualties. In the end, they were outnumbered and were landed. The Japanese soldiers invaded Gaolan Island, immediately replenished and killed the militiamen in each township, and set up camps near the small hills. On the one hand, they issued announcements to try to buy people's hearts and sent people to preach, and on the other hand, they sent technicians to survey and map the nearby terrain and waterways. The initial landing force was only more than a hundred people, but it then increased to more than three hundred people, actively engaging in occupying the nearby small islands. Gaolan Island is connected to Qiao Island and Shizi Bay south of Tangjiawan. To the left is Sanzao Island in the seventh district of Zhongshan County, and further in is Macau's Nanzin Island. To the right are Nanshui Island and Hebao Island. Among them, all the wealthy on Sanzao and Nanshui Islands have already fled, and the fishermen have also stopped going to sea. (November 18th)

### Suzhou Creek's Inland Water Ferries All Towed Away by the Japanese Yesterday

Twelve Vessels, Including the Li'an, Were Towed Away; Each Vessel Cost an Average of 10,000 Yuan

According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, since our troops retreated from Shanghai's west, inland water transportation between the city and other regions has been cut off. Recently, a Portuguese businessman emerged and organized the Deqi Inland Water Shipping Company, buying up the remaining vessels in Shanghai from various shipping bureaus along Suzhou Creek. They planned to first open the Shanghai-Pudong route, and then gradually extend to the interior, in order to facilitate passenger and cargo transport. Negotiations with the docked vessels were completed, and they had all changed to fly the Portuguese flag. Unexpectedly, yesterday at around 3:00 PM, the Japanese suddenly dispatched several motorboats and towed away all the small steamships from various shipping bureaus. According to the reporter's investigation, those towed away included the Li'an and Li'ning from the Lixing Shipping Bureau; the Shenxing and Liting from the Huanjiang Shipping Bureau; the Yuanfeng from the Yuantong Shipping Bureau; the Xinhaozhou from the Lixing Company; the Public Works Department's garbage boat Tailong; three small diesel boats; and another vessel named Huatong, for a total of twelve vessels. Each vessel cost around 10,000 yuan. It is reported that various inland water shipping bureaus originally had no fewer than a hundred vessels, but most of them were stranded in the interior after the outbreak of war. Now they have been completely towed away. It is also reported that when the Japanese sent boats into Suzhou Creek yesterday, they had two small boats loaded with white rice, which they scattered along the way to the poor boatmen docked on both sides of Suzhou Creek, and then towed away the small steamships of various shipping bureaus.

### The Cost of Living in This City Has Risen Sharply

The National Tariff Commission Announces a 23% Increase in September

According to the National Tariff Commission, the cost of living index in this city rose sharply in September of this year, increasing by about 23% compared to before the war. The details are recorded below:

Reasons for the Increase

The index for September was 147.7, a further increase of 9.7% compared to the 134.6 in August. Compared with the pre-war index of 120.0 in July, it increased by about 23%. The increase in the index for that month was mainly due to the continued rise in market prices of coal briquettes, cigarettes, matches, and meat. As for the main foods, white rice and wheat flour, they have tended to stabilize. The reasons are: (1) At the time of the outbreak of the war, there was inevitably panic in the market, but after a month, people's minds gradually stabilized, and most shops have reopened one after another; (2) The population has decreased due to the successive relocation and dispersal of citizens and refugees from the war zone; (3) A portion of the households have sufficient food reserves, and there is no need to seek outside help for the time being; (4) Setting a maximum price for rice has provided considerable restraint for those who hoard and speculate, and the authorities in the two concessions have also made many efforts to maintain transportation and supply food, and adjusted them separately.

Comparison of Categories

Compared with August, all indexes continued to rise except for clothing and rent. The increase in fuel was particularly large, with an index of 178.9, an increase of 18.9% compared to 150.5 in August. Spot coal briquettes are extremely scarce, with a price of three yuan per dan, an increase of 64% compared to 1.675 yuan in August. Matches are also scarce and prices have risen, while the price of firewood is the same as in August. The food index was 141.4, a further increase of 10.0% compared to 128.5 in August, of which white rice, wheat flour, and vegetables rose slightly. The miscellaneous goods index was 184.1, an increase of 10% compared to 166.2 in August, due to the increase in the price of cigarettes and soap.

### Estimated Losses in the Shipping Industry During Wartime

Ship Value of 30 Million Yuan; 60,000 People Unemployed

Since the outbreak of the war, the losses in China's shipping industry have been enormous. According to people familiar with the shipping industry, since the beginning of the war, the direct losses of Chinese merchant ships that have been confirmed amount to 75 Jianghai ships, with a total ship value of approximately 22.2 million yuan in national currency. Sixteen ships that were leased to Japan in advance and temporarily confiscated by them were lost, with a value of approximately 5 million yuan. Unconfirmed losses are not counted. The suspension of duties of various ship crews and the dismissal of sailors have also led to the stagnation of the dock and warehouse industries. In Shanghai alone, the number of people in the shipping industry who have lost their jobs due to the war (including workers in docks, warehouses, and barges) is at least 60,000.

### Order in the City is Gradually Improving

However, All Industries Remain Extremely Bleak; Some Sandbags Have Been Removed

Recently, thanks to the efforts of the concession authorities in planning and the assistance of all relevant parties, order in the city has gradually improved. Currently, in the northern district of the Public Concession, except for the area east of North Sichuan Road and south of Waibaidu Bridge, which is still not open, the rest of the area east of North Xizang Road, north of Suzhou Road, and to Avenue Edward VII and Avenue du Roi Albert, most of those who had taken refuge on the south bank of Suzhou Creek have now moved back. The number of pedestrians on the streets is increasing day by day, and shops have also reopened one after another to meet the market demand. Daily necessities are available, but there are two things that residents in the area find difficult and are eager to resolve: the small number of rice selling places and the fact that some households have had their water cut off by the company due to the landlord's failure to pay water bills, and have not yet been restored. As for the situation in the two concessions south of Suzhou Creek, most shops have long since resumed normal business. However, due to the extreme reduction in the purchasing power of citizens during this extraordinary period, the business situation is extremely bleak. In other respects, many entertainment venues such as cinemas, theaters, and dance halls have also resumed business. As for the barricades such as sandbags and barbed wire that the concession authorities had previously installed to guard the safety of the concession, in various places bordering the Chinese territory, and also had the same installations in various important government offices, it is now learned that the concession authorities have decided to first remove some of them within the concession that are not important and affect traffic. For example, the sandbags at the southern end of Tianhou Palace Bridge at the intersection of Henan Road and Beijing Road were removed yesterday. It is reported that the concession authorities are concerned about the serious unemployment situation within the concession, and are planning to promote production work to ensure the peace and order of the public.

### The 400 Million People of China Cannot Be Subdued by Cannons

A Famous German Scholar's Broadcast Speech; Roosevelt Continues to Strive for Peace; The Catholic Church in Lyon Condemns the Aggression

[Berlin] Professor He Xifu, a famous geographer at the University of Munich who has spent many years in the Far East and has a deep understanding of the Far East, gave an important radio speech today, stating that Japanese leaders still do not believe that the conflict in the Far East can be resolved by cannons, or that another Chinese government can replace the current government led by General Chiang Kai-shek. It must be understood that a country of 480 million people cannot be subdued by the rumble of cannons. Therefore, although the politicians and militarists around the Japanese Emperor have put forward certain harsh demands and opposed what they consider to be unfair interference, they also feel that they have failed to create the impression of a victor. There is no boundary that can divide China into north and south, and a second Chinese government will not be able to guarantee peace any more than the Chiang Kai-shek government. His conclusion stated that the sky in northwestern China is obviously becoming more and more blood red, and it is imaginable what an impossible thing it is to subject China to non-Chinese rule for a long time. (Haitong Telegraph, 26th)

[Washington] When President Roosevelt met with reporters today, he was asked what policy the United States would adopt when the Nine-Power Treaty Conference adjourned tonight. President Roosevelt replied that he was determined to continue to work for peace. (Reuters, 26th)

⊙Lyon, France The Spiritual Association founded by the Catholic Church here, whose members are mostly intellectuals, recently passed a resolution at a meeting opposing the Japanese invasion of China, and strongly condemning Japan's destruction of Chinese hospitals, schools, and churches, and the massacre of non-combatants. The resolution also stated, "We unreservedly oppose this kind of reckless act of war. As for the Chinese people fighting for freedom, this is exactly the same as our will." (Havas, 27th)

[London] People in Nottinghamshire held a mass meeting today to support the National Cabinet. Sir John Simon, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, also attended in person and gave a speech on the British political, economic, and diplomatic situation. When he talked about the situation in the Far East, he only said, "Britain is extremely concerned about maintaining peace in the Far East, but since the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, peace still seems to be out of sight." (Havas, 26th)

[Geneva] The Chinese League of Nations Association recently sent a telegram to the International Association of League of Nations Associations here, stating, "This association agrees with the various principles put forward in the declaration of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. It should request the countries concerned to provide effective assistance to China on the one hand, and sever economic relations with the aggressor country on the other hand. The League of Nations and the Nine-Power Treaty Conference should also continue to actively work together to deal with armed aggression through collective action. The Chinese government has now moved to Chongqing due to strategic reasons in order to continue the war of resistance. In short, the future of the Far East and world peace have become seriously related, and it is hoped that all countries will plan for it as soon as possible." (Havas, 26th)

[London] The Chinese Propaganda Committee held a meeting here last night. Mr. Blanc, the secretary of the London Clergy Association, spoke, strongly praising the spirit of perseverance shown by the Chinese people in dealing with the Japanese invasion, and said that even if China loses, it will eventually revive and become a great nation. Miss Gu Weijun, the daughter of the Chinese ambassador to France, also spoke at the scene, saying that China must resist aggression, but the Chinese people have no hatred for the Japanese people. Yao Zhangnong, a Chinese opera writer, said that the Chinese people are determined to resist the war until the Japanese troops completely withdraw from Chinese territory. (Reuters, 27th)

⊙Brussels Before leaving Brussels, Gu Weijun, the Chinese representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, met with a representative of the Haitong News Agency and said that if the world wants to maintain peace in the Far East, greater consideration should be given to providing material assistance to China. China still hopes that the signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty will fulfill their obligations, and he also understands the difficulties faced by various countries. As for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, although it lacks concrete results, it is not completely ineffective, because the conference has officially informed the world that China is on the side of justice and reason. Once this point is clarified, the issue of material assistance can be easily resolved. Regarding the mediation by a third country, Gu stated that this kind of mediation can only be based on the Nine-Power Treaty and carried out at the conference, because the right and wrong of the Far East issue are determined according to this treaty. Since Japan has violated the treaty, it is the natural obligation of the signatory countries not to help Japan with military supplies, but to help China in accordance with the provisions of the treaty. Regarding the fact that the League of Nations will hold a meeting to discuss the situation in the Far East, Gu clearly stated that China welcomes this discussion in Geneva. Finally, Gu refuted the predictions of Japan's final victory. China is now fulfilling its obligations and fighting for peace in the Far East, and hopes that other countries will also adopt the same means to fulfill their obligations. (Haitong Telegraph, 27th)

### Konoe Talks Announcing War and Peace Policies

The Current Situation is a Stage; Subsequent Military Plans Are Kept Secret

[Tokyo] Prime Minister Konoe told reporters today that if the Nanjing government and Chairman Chiang change their policy towards Japan and negotiate with the Japanese government, Japan is prepared to respond. However, if the Nanjing government decides to resist Japan for a long time, Japan is also prepared to accept its challenge. As for subsequent military plans, he has not heard of them, because the cabinet and the general headquarters have only held one joint meeting. But even if he had heard of them, it would not be convenient to announce them. In the eyes of ordinary people, the current state of the war against China can be regarded as the end of one stage, but in his opinion, General Matsui, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in Shanghai, is correct in saying that the Japanese army can attack not only Nanjing and Hankou, but also Chongqing. As for Japan's fundamental policy towards China, there is no change, that is, it requires China to reconsider and abandon its anti-Japanese policy and cooperate with Japan. (Reuters, 27th)

[Tokyo] Asahi Shimbun today published Prime Minister Konoe's remarks to Japanese reporters, saying that Japan may need to use force against the Shanghai Public Concession, and everything now depends on the third parties concerned. He also said that we are now waiting for Shandong to fall into our hands naturally. Judging from the current situation, if China resists for a long time, an independent political situation will arise in North China and other places. This is very possible. Konoe also said that we have decided not to declare war, but if time changes, it may be necessary to declare war, which is also unknown. The Nine-Power Treaty is an excuse for other countries to interfere in Far Eastern affairs. Japan intends to propose amending or abolishing this treaty at an appropriate time. Japan made it clear a few years ago that it would not allow Europe and the United States to interfere in the Far East, so we should have taken steps to amend or abolish the treaty long ago. Konoe finally said that the Soviet Union has not taken any active anti-Japanese actions so far. (Reuters, 27th)

### Roosevelt Plans to Revitalize Commerce

Preparing to Amend Tariffs; Isolationists Are Very Active

⊙Kansas City The American Legion today announced that it is distributing 500,000 petitions nationwide, seeking 25 million signatures, to petition Congress and President Roosevelt to "adopt and implement various policies to avoid the United States being involved in the vortex of war." According to these people, "We know that members of Congress generally want to avoid war, but we still want to make the members of Congress pay more attention when discussing certain bills related to international events, and no longer allow the US government to have the obligation to send troops to foreign countries." (Guomin Telegraph, 26th)

[Washington] President Roosevelt is now trying his best to revitalize domestic commerce. He instructed Congress tonight to amend commercial tariffs and ordered government agencies to purchase equipment worth 145,000,000 yuan as soon as possible. According to Congressman Vincent, it is difficult to predict when the new tariff bill will be drafted. Congress is now working hard to submit it for discussion at this special meeting. (Guomin Telegraph, 26th)

[Washington] President Roosevelt told reporters today that he would amend tariffs as soon as Congress was ready. He also said that he had now sent letters to government agencies, instructing them to budget for the needs of supplies within the current fiscal year. Although the government cannot purchase as much as possible in the next month or two, this move should encourage industry. On Sunday, he will submit a message to Congress on housing, and on Tuesday, he will send another message, advocating reducing the federal government's annual appropriation for road construction. (Reuters, 26th)

[Washington] Regarding the reform of the current tax system, some members of Congress have proposed bills to amend the industrial and commercial profit tax. The proposals were submitted to the Finance Committee of the Senate for discussion, and it was immediately decided to retain its amendments proposed to the subcommittee and also decided to postpone the discussion. In this way, the attempt to submit this bill for a vote within the current session of Congress has almost been declared a failure. It has been found that business people originally believed that the amendment of the profit tax rate was extremely important. They will inevitably express dissatisfaction with this decision of the Finance Committee of the House of Representatives, and the current strained relationship between the business community and the government, which was hoped to be eased, will not be able to be improved. However, President Roosevelt recently had a conversation with the general manager of a large electric company, and the general manager of the company has agreed to allocate 100,000,000 US dollars in the next two years to improve equipment. This is the initial success of the president's urging of various companies to increase improvement expenses to revitalize the market. Regarding this matter, the government had previously formulated a large-scale plan to utilize water power. Once implemented, the business of various electric companies would inevitably be affected. Therefore, these companies cut back on various improvement expenses in order to see what the detailed situation of this plan was. At the same time, President Roosevelt also asked these companies to reduce electricity charges, and misunderstandings arose between the two parties. However, since the president had talks with the authorities of these companies, there seems to be room for a compromise. (Havas, 26th)

### Former Cuban President Arrested in New York

[New York] Former Cuban President Machado has recently been arrested here by the authorities, because of the Cuban government's extradition request. Machado is accused of murder and embezzlement of public funds. It has been found that Machado was hailed as the fifth president of Cuba in 1925, and was re-elected in 1929, but not long after, his colleagues rebelled, and Machado fled in a hurry and lived in the United States.

### Hungary Does Not Participate in the Anti-Communist Pact

Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Visit Berlin and Return Home

[Berlin] The talks between Hungarian Prime Minister Darányi and Foreign Minister Kánya and the German authorities have ended today. Officials here expressed satisfaction with the results of the talks, believing that although Hungary refused to participate in the anti-communist pact between Italy, Germany, and Japan, Hungary and Germany have long had a tacit understanding on preventing Bolshevism within their respective countries. Regarding this point, well-informed German sources also said that there are two reasons why the Hungarian authorities refused to participate in the anti-communist pact: (1) This move would cause doubts and various difficulties internationally, which the Hungarian government is eager to avoid; (2) Hungary is willing to wait for other major countries to join this pact before considering it. In addition, Hungary and Germany seem to have reached a compromise on Hungary's request to revise the Treaty of Trianon in order to restore equal rights to armaments, that is, Germany unconditionally supports it. Regarding economic issues, Germany has agreed to increase the purchase of Hungarian iron, alumina, grains, and vegetable oilseeds, and supply Hungary with chemical industrial products, machinery, and other manufactured goods. Regarding the issue of German minorities in Hungary, the Hungarian authorities have agreed to improve their treatment, and Germany has expressed satisfaction as a result, and has provided assurances regarding the activities of German National Socialist Party members in Hungary, stating that it will no longer protect them. (Havas, 26th)

Capital of Hungary Prime Minister Darányi, who had recently traveled to Berlin with Foreign Minister Kánya to visit, has now returned here and immediately declared that Germany and Hungary's interests are more aligned than ever today. Rumors that misunderstandings have occurred between the two countries are exaggerated. Germany and Hungary now intend to cooperate on various issues related to the two countries, and as in the past, they will proceed in a friendly spirit, and the policy of strengthening the friendship between Germany and Hungary should also proceed in this way to achieve satisfactory results. (Havas, 27th)

[Berlin] The Deutsche Diplomatisch-Politische Korrespondenz, which represents the views of the German Foreign Ministry, recently discussed the visit of Hungarian cabinet members to Germany and the effect of this visit on German-Hungarian friendship, strongly stating that Germany has no intention of dominating Central Europe. Not only do the German people not have this idea, but the German people have always been able to deeply respect the inalienable rights of other countries. This fact can be proved by the German-Hungarian relationship and the consolidation of their friendship, and it can also prove that Germany has no desire to be in the leading position in Central Europe. The newspaper continued, the result of the visit of Hungarian Prime Minister Darányi and Foreign Minister Kánya to Germany proves that German-Hungarian friendship is built on the same interests. Therefore, it is natural for the two countries to exchange opinions on all political issues at any time. Because the common goal of Germany and Hungary is the natural harmony between the two nations enjoying the same rights. (Haitong Telegraph, 26th)

### French and Italian Discord

A Word from the French Minister of the Navy; Italian Newspapers Launch a Major Attack

[Paris] Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Rayroux recently met with Italian Chargé d'Affaires Berlucchi. It is reported that Italian newspapers have recently been attacking the speech given by French Minister of the Navy Campinchi at Toulon. The discussion between Rayroux and Berlucchi today was probably related to this matter. (Havas, 27th)

[Rome] Regarding the speech given by French Minister of the Navy Campinchi at Toulon on the 23rd of last month, after it was fiercely attacked by the Italian Il Giornale d'Italia yesterday, although the French Navy has stated that there was no such speech, the attacks by Italian newspapers have not diminished. The Fascist Il Lavoro Fascista stated that France is now preparing for war. If that country regards Italy as an enemy, it must know that Italy is a formidable enemy. Il Popolo d'Italia fiercely attacked Campinchi personally. (Havas, 26th)

[Rome] Newspapers here are demanding the resignation of French Minister of the Navy Campinchi to apologize to Italy, saying that Campinchi gave an anti-Italian speech to French sailors in Toulon on October 22, including that France could launch an offensive from the French island of Corsica in the Mediterranean Sea and force the fascists to submit. Although Campinchi has denied making this statement, Italian newspapers still do not believe it. An Italian journalist recently published an article in Paris advocating Franco-Italian reconciliation, but this article was confiscated, and the journalist also left Paris. As a result, accusations from the Italian side arose again, and demands for the French Minister of the Navy to resign followed one after another. At the same time, the French Navy has issued a statement refuting the records of Minister Campinchi's remarks in Italian newspapers, saying that Campinchi's speech was published in French newspapers at the time and had no international nature. (Reuters, 27th)

### Franco-Polish Relations

All Circles in Poland Welcome the French Foreign Minister's Visit

⊙Warsaw All circles in Poland are very satisfied that French Foreign Minister Delbos will come here in the near future. The general public believes that the French Foreign Minister's visit has no specific purpose, and is only to exchange views within the normal scope of the Franco-Polish alliance, and to discuss the general trend of various existing international issues with Polish people. The Polish Mail stated that Poland's foreign policy takes close cooperation with the major democratic countries of Western Europe as its main guideline. After the French Foreign Minister's visit to Poland, it will enable Poland to gain a foothold politically in Western Europe and allow Poland to occupy a considerable position. As for rumors that Bak, the Polish Foreign Minister, will go to Berlin after Delbos's visit to Poland, this statement has been denied by responsible officials. (Havas, 27th)

### New Developments Brewing in the European Situation

A Major Key is the Anglo-French Conversation, Japan Does Not Abandon Trusteeship of Islands

[Tokyo] The Colonial Ministry today released an article stating that regardless of any changes in the international situation, the Japanese government will never relinquish its trusteeship over South Pacific islands. This is a settled policy of the Japanese government and has been repeatedly stated since Japan withdrew from the League of Nations. Recently, there have been various rumors and speculations about the future status of the trustee islands, all of which are without any factual basis. (Reuters, 27th)

[London] Regarding Germany's request to restore its old colonies, after Lord Halifax, British Lord Privy Seal, held talks with German Führer Hitler, the British and French authorities will hold talks to discuss the matter. Some people in political circles here believe that the final result may be a special conference to revise the clauses in the Treaty of Versailles regarding the distribution of German colonies. Others say that what the British and French authorities should discuss is whether Germany's request to restore its old colonies can be considered, or whether only an open-door policy should be adopted towards Germany within these colonies. If the discussion results in a decision to consider Germany's request, then the countries of Central Europe, including Czechoslovakia, must be included in the negotiations, because the entrustment of Germany's old colonies to certain countries for governance is based on the Treaty of Versailles, and the countries of Central Europe are all signatories to the treaty. It is generally believed that Czechoslovakia may express acceptance, but only on the condition that Germany formally recognizes the territorial integrity of Czechoslovakia. Observers believe that if Germany and Czechoslovakia can adopt this procedure, then in the future, Germany and the countries of Central Europe can freely conclude agreements and establish new relations with each other, and various current economic difficulties can be resolved, the impact of which is self-evident. People in British diplomatic circles believe that, for the time being, Britain only intends to propose a plan that, on the one hand, adopts an open-door policy towards Germany within its old colonies, and on the other hand, provides financial assistance to Germany to purchase raw materials, but does not necessarily consider returning the colonies to Germany. (Havas, 26th)

[London] Regarding the talks conducted by British Lord Privy Seal Lord Halifax in Berlin, well-informed sources here recently declared that the British authorities had informed the French government of the content of the talks, first orally by Foreign Secretary Eden to the French Ambassador to Britain, Corbin, and later by the British Ambassador to France, Sir Eric Phipps, in a note delivered to the French Foreign Ministry. After French Premier Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos arrive here within days, the British and French authorities must thoroughly discuss the matter. In addition, the British authorities have also orally notified the various British Dominions. Among them, the Union of South Africa, as the mandated territory of German Southwest Africa, naturally agrees with Germany's request to reclaim its old colonies, but if future negotiations are limited to purely economic issues, then the Union may agree to implement an open-door policy in Southwest Africa to benefit Germany. (Havas, 26th)

[London] Regarding the upcoming talks between French Premier Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos and Britain, various newspapers here have recently commented extensively. Among them, the Liberal Party's "Star" stated that this move will promote early and meaningful negotiations between Britain and Germany. Although the British government is now prepared to reconcile with Germany, it must still maintain its friendship with France, because the amicable relationship between Britain and France is regarded as an indelible traditional spirit in Britain. The "Economist" weekly stated that Chautemps and Delbos' visit is reassuring, indicating that Britain and France will oppose any demands made by Germany if Germany is not prepared to participate in a collective security system in exchange. (Havas, 26th)

### Random Notes from Lieshan

— Feng Lieshan

On a Steamer

Because the reporter was eager to return to the country this time, I couldn't buy a cabin on an Italian or German mail ship on short notice, so I ended up taking a British mail ship. After boarding, I realized that things were not going well. It turned out that almost all the passengers on the ship were British people who had served in the colonies in the Far East. Although I have become accustomed to British life in recent years, in addition to liking British-style breakfast, I have also learned a bit of the gentlemanly attitude of "always waiting for others to speak first," but this time I really feel a little overwhelmed. Ordinary British people do have a habit of not talking much, but they are still a polite nation. At the very least, they would never embarrass people in person. For example, they are not used to "shaking hands" with people, but greetings such as "Hello," "Good morning," and "Good evening" are often on their lips. In British social circles, dullness seems inevitable, but an unsettling phenomenon is not easily seen. The British people who have been to the colonies are obviously different. If they have not forgotten all the greetings such as "Good morning" and "Good evening," at the very least, because they are not used often, they are too lazy to say them.

According to the opinion of a Chinese worker on the ship, the shipping authorities have been particularly preferential to the reporter personally. The best proof is that my seat in the dining room is with British passengers. In fact, their kindness has implicated me. In the first one or two weeks, I had to put on a serious face almost every day, and at the same time, I had to listen to words that I didn't need to hear.

The knowledge of this group of passengers about the Far East problem is not as good as that of a German exporter. The problems of the wives are even more wonderful, such as "Does China also have an army?" So we asked back, "If China didn't have an army, how could the current Sino-Japanese war have happened?" They naturally fell silent after hearing this. The gentlemen's observation is that China's biggest weakness is still internal war. I told them that the Chinese people are now awakened, and "Chinese people don't fight Chinese people" is the foundation of this all-out war of resistance. As a result, they are still half-convinced.

A senior staff member on the ship reported the war news he heard to us every day. He is a good person, but the news he brought is always unfavorable to China. One day, the reporter couldn't bear it anymore and asked him why he always gave us this unfortunate news when British newspapers often published news that was favorable to China. Later, he automatically cancelled this obligatory errand.

It wasn't until after Penang that this group of passengers read the English newspapers in Southeast Asia that their attitude changed. They felt that during their five or six months of vacation, China had become another world. One wife said to the reporter that she really didn't expect the Chinese soldiers to be so brave.

The Captain

Although the captain is a middle-aged British man, he has a very straightforward temperament, probably because he is used to life at sea. He has the air of saying whatever he wants to say. He is an opponent of the existence of newspapers. In addition to the reporter, there is also a reporter from the English "Malay Mail" among the passengers. One day, he explained to the British reporter why he opposed newspapers. He said: "There is nothing wrong in the world. With newspapers, things become more and more troublesome. News reporters are people who are afraid that the world will not be in chaos..."

The British reporter was stunned. He asked if the captain didn't read the newspaper?

"Read the newspaper?" The captain said loudly, "No, I never read the newspaper. The newspaper is an agency that manufactures rumors."

This authentic gentlemanly British reporter also felt that this problem was not easy to deal with. He said, "Are the news in the newspapers unreliable? Are we reporters all lying and fabricating things out of thin air? ...I'm afraid sir is not very attentive to current affairs..."

"Not attentive to current affairs?" The captain was a little excited: "I listen to the radio every day, and I understand everything that happens internationally. In fact, newspapers are useless, aren't they? Everything in the newspapers is on the radio?"

The captain's argument, which opposes the news in newspapers but supports the news on radio broadcasts, is naturally a contradiction, but his attitude was very firm when he spoke, making the British reporter embarrassed. I was sitting too far away to interrupt.

This captain also had a different view on the Sino-Japanese War.

He, like other passengers, looked down on the Chinese people's resistance. He once predicted to the reporter that the Sino-Japanese War would end within a week or two. He said that Japan would estimate the area north of the Yangtze River within a week or two, and that the whole problem would be solved immediately after Japan achieved this goal.

The reporter asked him at the time whether this was his personal opinion or Britain's hope. He replied: "Japan doesn't want to occupy all of China!"

After arriving in Penang, even a captain with such a strong subjective view changed his mind about the achievements of our army's resistance. He chatted with a British passenger behind his back, saying: "I didn't expect the Chinese army to be so brave."

As soon as the steamer sailed past Penang, the ship almost became another world. The captain asked the reporter: "Mr. Feng? What's the news?" The reporter replied: "Captain, the Chinese soldiers are fighting well!"

The captain smiled: "Ah, really good."

### The Holocaust of Burning in the South City

Affected Refugee Areas, Fortunately Extinguished Immediately, Executing Thieves to Curb Robbery

After our military police withdrew from the South City, flames spread everywhere and burned everywhere. At first, this was considered a common occurrence in war, but unexpectedly, fires have continued to break out in various places in recent days, without any respite. Some say that thieves deliberately set fires after looting, while others say that unscrupulous people set fires to vent their anger after failing to extort money. Everyone says something different, and it is also impossible to move freely, which is quite strange. Yesterday afternoon, the 16th Bund and the Lao Ximen area continued to be burned. The Minli Girls' High School on Wenmiao Road has been burned down, and the Municipal Zoo has also been affected. A small number of houses with party-related colors in the Public Education Center (i.e., the old Confucian Temple) have been destroyed. In the fire in the Xiaodongmen area of the 16th Bund, sparks flew into the refugee area, but fortunately, the rescue was effective and no disaster occurred. The houses in the South City that have not been burned down are nailed with wooden bars by the Japanese military headquarters and sealed with seals, stating that no unauthorized entry is allowed and that there should be no more looting. Now, the robbery in the South City area has been curbed. More than a dozen people were arrested the day before yesterday and executed in unison. An old man surnamed Lu passed by the Haichao Temple and witnessed the execution of three thieves.

The flames in the South City are now intensifying. Even the refugee area has been affected, causing fires in several places. Although the French Concession authorities sent fire trucks to extinguish the fire, the fire was so fierce that it was ineffective. As a result, the fires on Wenmiao Road, Xinbeimen, Tangjia Road, Penglai Market, Xiaonanmen, Lao Ximen, and Qingnian Street burned day and night. The intensity of the fire is unprecedented. As a result, the South City is ablaze, and the small number of houses remaining in the embers have almost been assimilated into nothing.

Also, it was reported that from 1:00 PM yesterday, fires broke out in five places in Nan City, Xiaoximen North, Wenmiao Road, Menghua Street, and Ximennei Zhaojia Road, Jumen Road, Fangxie Road, and Lujiabang, etc. The fire in Menghua Street was the most intense. Until late at night, it was still flying in fierce flames.

### Recent Situation in Chuansha, Pudong

Someone from Heqing Town, Chuansha, Pudong, came to Shanghai to talk about it. The county seat of Chuansha is now maintained by the business community itself. The security aspect is entrusted to the militia. The stores are open as usual. A small number of Japanese troops once came to the county for inspection and then withdrew, expressing that they would not advise the local area. In the towns and villages north of the county, such as Xiaowan, Dawan, Xijia Lukou, Caojia Lukou, Gujia Lukou, and Xujiaqiao, the people have formed self-defense forces, under the guidance of legitimate local people, so they can be loyal to their duties, making it difficult for bandits to be active. When the war first started in Bailonggang on the coast, Japanese warships shelled it three times, firing seventy or eighty shells. The farthest point where the shells landed was only between Zhongxutang and Guoxutang. There were only a few thatched houses in the area, so the damage was minimal. After our army withdrew, they went to the port to observe and saw that the trenches of our army were still there, all built on the Xiaobai Road area on the south bank of Bailonggang. The trench line extended for about several miles, meandering and winding, and was extremely solid, so it was extremely difficult for the Japanese army to attack and land at that time. The section of the Shanghai-Chuansha small train railway from Qingning Temple to Jinjiaqiao has been dismantled. The section from Jinjiaqiao to Zhujiaqiao is still open as usual. The scheduled train times are 8:00 AM from Zhujiaqiao and 11:00 AM from Jinjiaqiao. In the afternoon, it departs from Zhujiaqiao at 2:00 PM and returns from Jinjiaqiao at 4:00 PM. There are two round trips every morning and afternoon. Because of the congestion of passengers and goods, there is sufficient time in the morning, so the time can be maintained. However, when it departs from Zhujiaqiao in the afternoon, it arrives at Jinjiaqiao at about 5:00 PM, causing the 4:00 PM train to be off schedule and return to Zhujiaqiao, usually at 8:00 PM.

### Fire Breaks Out Again in Pudong

Destroying Fifty to Sixty Houses

A fire broke out again at Laobaidu, Pudong, at two o'clock in the afternoon yesterday. The streets there are crisscrossed and have always been a prosperous area, so the flames spread in all directions and were very fierce. The thick smoke rushed high into the sky and could be seen from as far away as Puxi. The fire burned until about 5:00 PM in the evening and has not yet been extinguished. About fifty to sixty houses have been destroyed.

### Britain Negotiates with the Japanese Government on Customs Issues

Any Changes Must Be Discussed First, The United States and France Take the Same Action, British Newspapers Publish Strong Comments

[London] Official circles announced today that the British government has instructed its ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, to clearly state to the Japanese government that any measures regarding Chinese customs must be discussed with the British government first. In addition to the British government, the United States and France are also concerned about the debt secured by tariffs, so the three countries have been constantly discussing and contacting each other on this issue. When French Premier Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos meet with British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Eden on Monday to discuss the general international situation, they will definitely discuss the status of Shanghai. (Reuters, 27th)

[London] British diplomatic circles recently declared, "The British government has instructed the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, to ensure that the Japanese government fully understands and has no doubt that if there are any changes to the Chinese customs system, the British government requires that it must be consulted with the British government first." Well-informed sources added, "The governments of the United States and France are also very concerned about the Chinese customs issue, and negotiations are currently underway between London, Paris, and Washington. However, the necessary measures deemed necessary by each country will be decided separately by the United Kingdom, France, and the United States." In addition, the British government is also extremely concerned about Japan's intention to control Shanghai's postal and radio communications. Although people generally do not believe that the British government has negotiated with the Japanese government on this issue, it is believed that the British government has requested the British authorities in Shanghai to submit a full and detailed report on this issue. (Havas, 27th)

[London] The "Daily Telegraph" diplomatic reporter said that in recent days, the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have been discussing the new situation in Shanghai. When French Premier Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos visit London at the end of this week, they will enable countries to quickly reach agreement on the issue of jointly negotiating with Japan to protect the rights stipulated in the international treaties concluded by the countries with the Chinese government. (Reuters, 27th)

[London] The "Daily Telegraph" published an editorial today entitled "Closing the Doors of Shanghai," stating that the question of whether Japan's policy is controlled by the battlefield or comes from Tokyo has now been resolved, and it is known that the commander who wins on the battlefield actually holds the power. General Matsui's methods have been applying increasing pressure to the legitimate administrative organs of Shanghai in the past week. Protests may not be able to curb Japan's current behavior, and legal considerations may not be fully applicable to Shanghai's immediate future. However, Britain's strong protest will definitely have value, and the value will be even greater if other countries follow suit. Japan's political strategy is to create a de facto extraordinary situation and not allow it to be temporarily released, so that this extraordinary situation can be perpetuated. Therefore, if strong negotiations are not made at this time, there will be no doubt that Shanghai will be occupied by the Japanese army. Looking at Japan's behavior in Manchuria and Hebei, we can see that Japan is determined to prevent China from trading with countries other than Japan. Japan is now using force to seize the position of the legitimate administrative organs of Shanghai in the name of clearing out saboteurs, but in fact, Shanghai has never been suspected of communist tendencies. In the future, the business of Western countries will be completely excluded from China's largest port, and the name it is borrowing is nothing more than anti-communism. It is time to pay attention to this fact before the doors of Shanghai are closed. (Reuters, 27th)

### German Minister of Economics Schacht Resigns

Deputy Minister of Propaganda Fink Succeeds, German Newspapers Say He Does Not Want Economic Isolation

[Berlin] According to reliable sources, the stability of the German currency will not be affected by the change of cabinet members. However, General Göring's position is now becoming increasingly firm. Dr. Schacht has always been dissatisfied with the Four-Year Plan, which is why he has repeatedly requested to resign. In the future, the importance of the Ministry of Economics will be less than that of the Four-Year Plan. German industrialists have recently been forced to invest huge sums of money to manufacture things that can only be regarded as laboratory experiments, in the hope of producing substitutes for expensive raw materials abroad. Industrialists feel bitter. (Reuters, 27th)

[Berlin] Führer Hitler's letter of thanks to Dr. Schacht has been published today. Schacht has now resigned from the position of Minister of Economics and continues to serve as the President of the National Bank. Yesterday, he was also appointed as a Minister without Portfolio. Hitler's letter of thanks stated that since July 30, 1934, when German Minister of Economics Schmidt-de died of illness, you have taken on this position. Since you took office, you have made outstanding contributions to the new Germany. Therefore, your repeated requests to resign have not been approved. However, since you have presided over the implementation of the duties of the Minister of Economics and the Four-Year Plan, you have repeatedly requested to resign due to the heavy workload. I had to consider it and temporarily allowed you to get rid of the duties of the Minister of Economics. I would like to express my gratitude to you for your outstanding achievements for the country, and I hope that in the future, with the qualifications of the President of the National Bank, your extraordinary talents, and tireless spirit, you will be able to provide many years of facilities and contributions to Germany and me. I now appoint you as a Minister without Portfolio and allow you to continue to serve the motherland. (Haitong, 26th)

[Berlin] Minister of Economics and President of the Central Bank Dr. Schacht has recently resigned from the position of Minister of Economics. This matter has been rumored for a long time, but it was only realized today. According to a government press release, "Führer Hitler has accepted Schacht's request to resign as Minister of Economics and has appointed him as a Minister without Portfolio due to his contribution to the country. The position of Minister of Economics left by Schacht will be temporarily held concurrently by General Göring, the dictator of the Four-Year Economic Plan, so that Deputy Minister of Propaganda Fink can formally succeed him on January 15 of next year. In addition, the Führer also sent a letter to Schacht, briefly stating, "The scope of the Four-Year Economic Plan is expanding day by day. Today, it is necessary to merge the Ministry of Economics with the Administrative Bureau of the Four-Year Economic Plan. Since you have decided to resign from the Ministry of Economics, I will now grant you permission." (Havas, 26th)

[Berlin] The official here issued an order last night appointing Deputy Minister of Propaganda Fink as Minister of Economics, and transferring Director of the NSDAP Information Office Dietrich as Deputy Minister of Propaganda and Director of the Information Department. At the same time, Hank, the original counselor of the Ministry of Propaganda, was promoted to Deputy Minister of Propaganda. The three of them are all core members of the NSDAP who have been appointed to important government positions. Fink served as an economic reporter for the "Berlin Financial Daily" from 1912 to 1930. He was later recruited by Hitler to serve as an economic expert and Chairman of the NSDAP Economic Policy Committee. At the beginning of the NSDAP's administration, Hitler appointed Fink as Director of the Information Office. When the Ministry of Propaganda was established, he was appointed as Deputy Minister of Propaganda. Dietrich also came from the press. Before the NSDAP's administration, he served as an investigator for the Chamber of Commerce. In 1934, he was appointed as Director of the NSDAP Information Office. He is now in his forties. Hank has been a long-time colleague of Propaganda Minister Goebbels. When Goebbels was the leader of the Berlin NSDAP branch in 1926, Hank followed Goebbels without interruption. Later, he served as a third-class secretary in the Ministry of Propaganda and was promoted repeatedly, all in a step-by-step manner. He is now thirty-four years old. (Haitong, 27th)

[Berlin] This morning, all the newspapers here unanimously published the news of Fink's appointment as Minister of Economics in large characters, and strongly emphasized the importance of this appointment to the Four-Year Plan. The "Berlin Daily" stated that foreign commentators will definitely regard Fink's appointment as Minister of Economics as a further entry of Germany's economic life into a wartime basis. However, we can already anticipate this kind of comment and answer it in advance. The Four-Year Plan is not based on an isolationist policy and has nothing to do with warmongering ambitions. We just don't want to have a shortage of raw materials in a military state again. We do not want isolated self-sufficiency, but we want to be a member of international trade. But in international trade, there must be freedom of choice, and not necessarily so. Regarding the qualifications of the new minister, the newspaper praised Fink as the German economic authority who is most able to think calmly and handle complex matters with extraordinary perseverance. It is believed that he will be able to cope with all industries with both leniency and strictness and complete the task of a Minister of Economics. The newspaper also pointed out that changes in the German cabinet are not like those in other countries. They must be changed for important political and economic reasons. (Haitong, 27th)

[Berlin] Regarding the resignation of Dr. Schacht, President of the German Central Bank, from the concurrent position of Minister of Economics, the reason is that Schacht's powers were subject to various restrictions, making it difficult for him to assume the position of national economic authority, which led to this. Although Führer Hitler repeatedly tried to persuade him to stay, it was ultimately ineffective. The reason why this matter was kept secret in the past was because the time was not ripe and international public opinion had to be taken into account. Now that Schacht has resigned, and the qualifications of his successor, Fink, are difficult to compete with General Göring, the dictator of the Four-Year Economic Plan, General Göring will therefore enjoy extremely broad powers and may in fact be the national economic dictator. Although it is believable that General Göring will complete the Four-Year Plan, that is, the economic self-sufficiency plan, by having the German people tighten their belts, the Führer has appointed Schacht as a Minister without Portfolio and praised him in a letter, and has also hired him as a private consultant, which shows that he still takes into account the opinions of moderates. (Havas, 27th)

### Goering's Speech on Germany's Status

Forcefully Claims Man-Made Materials Can Occupy World Market

Hamburg – German Air Force Minister General Goering delivered a speech here today to 25,000 people, stating that Germany is now again respected by the world and is a great power worthy of alliance. The steel axis moves from Central Europe to Rome, and now extends to Tokyo. This is a better axis of peace, far surpassing the empty talkers of the League of Nations gathered in Geneva. We want peace, we do not want to take what belongs to others, but the nations of the world must now listen more carefully to Germany’s demands. This is inevitable. We have the same rights as other countries. We do not want to stop demanding colonies. We will eventually succeed. This will not be due to the goodwill of others, but to our own strength. Goering then discussed Germany’s Four-Year Plan, saying that the raw materials that other countries force Germany to produce itself are not substitutes like during the European War, but completely new materials, such as man-made dyes and fertilizers. What the world once ridiculed will eventually conquer the world market. (Reuters, 27th)

[Berlin] According to today’s official announcement, starting from January 1st of this year, the import tax on all rubber goods, previously 125 marks, will be increased to 160 marks. The rubber import tax was just implemented on May 13th of this year, with the aim of promoting the production of German man-made rubber and subsidizing the establishment of man-made rubber factories. This tax can be adjusted according to the price fluctuations of rubber raw materials, and may be abolished when the required funds are available. (Reuters, 26th)

[Berlin] The German government has decided to excavate a canal next year, called the “Hansa” Canal, which will directly connect the Ruhr province, mining area, and industrial area to the Baltic Sea. The entire project is expected to take six years to complete. The first section, from the port of Bremen to the port of Hamburg, will cost approximately 140,000,000 marks. Once completed, the coal produced in the Ruhr province can be quickly transported to the Baltic coast and compete with British coal. (Havas, 27th)

### Eight Italian Communists Sentenced to Death

### Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Sponsors Transportation and Purchase of Fresh Pork

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, yesterday, in order to support the Fresh Pork Industry Association in transporting and purchasing fresh pork to Shanghai, sent a letter to the Nantong Garrison Headquarters, which reads: Sirs, According to a letter from the Fresh Pork Industry Association in this city, this Association previously chartered special ships directly to Nantong to load fresh pork for the meat consumption of citizens in the Shanghai concessions, and requested your Association to forward a letter to the Nantong Garrison Headquarters for certification of clearance. The first batch of fresh pork purchased, transported by the Maher Company’s Maher steamer, one Jardine Matheson tugboat, and two iron barges, totaling over 2,000 head of fresh pork, was imported on the 23rd of this month, and the price of meat has slightly decreased, but supply and demand are still not balanced. In order to continue to regulate surpluses and deficits and balance meat prices in this city, this Association intends to charter another Jardine Matheson tugboat and two iron barges to transport fresh pork from Nantong, in order to bring the city's meat prices to normal levels and ease the burden on the people. In addition to the safety issue at the Wusongkou, which we still request the Municipal Council to safeguard, regarding the Nantong garrison, we intend to request your Association to prepare a letter and hand it over to this Association for certification. Furthermore, given the special situation in Shanghai, this Association has received reports that some non-industry people also want to charter foreign merchant ships to transport pork, but this Association has no way to investigate where it will be sold after arriving in Shanghai, fearing that it may lead to abuses. We propose that your Association prepare a letter to the Nantong Garrison Headquarters stating that if Shanghai sends special ships to Jiangbei to transport pork, it must have certification documents from your Association or this Association before it can be released, in order to prevent abuses. Correspondingly, we request you to investigate and grant approval. The Association has investigated that the said Association's second employment of a foreign Jardine Matheson tugboat and two iron barges to transport fresh pork from Nantong is for the purpose of continuing to supply meat to Shanghai, which is the responsibility of the said Association to handle, and is considered appropriate. Therefore, we specially continue the previous case, requesting your Headquarters to allow the said ships to berth and load/unload at Tianshenggang to facilitate market sales. In the future, if Shanghai opens special ships to transport pork to various Jiangbei counties, please also rely on the certification documents of this Association or the said Association, in order to be cautious. This is our utmost request, and we hope to receive a reply.

### Concession Property Tax Revenue Sharply Decreases Due to the War

Both Chinese and Western Styles Inside and Outside the Concession Significantly Decreased Compared to the Same Period Last Year

According to the Municipal Council's tax report, the property tax revenue in the Public Concession has been deeply affected by the war. In October of last year, the revenue from Western-style houses within the concession reached over 501,200 yuan, while the revenue for the same month this year was only over 386,400 yuan. As for the property tax on Western-style houses outside the concession, the revenue in October of last year was over 45,600 yuan, while the revenue for the same month this year was only over 40,300 yuan.

As for Chinese-style houses within the concession, the revenue in October of last year was over 2,300 yuan, while the revenue for the same month this year was only over 900 yuan. The decline is significant in all cases.

### Chinese Red Cross Society to Organize Education for Refugee Children

Seeking Empty Five-Pound Biscuit Tins and Used Copybooks or Sketch Pads

The International Relief Committee of the Chinese Red Cross Society is actively organizing education for refugees. Due to the large number of refugee children, desks, chairs, and school supplies are difficult to purchase. Therefore, it is planned to collect empty biscuit tins of five pounds or more for refugee children to use as chairs and for storing items. Used and leftover notebook paper and sketch pads that can be used for refugee children's schoolwork are also needed. The above items are often regarded as waste in households, and the Association's idea of utilizing waste is something that kind-hearted people are happy to help with. If you have such items, you can send them directly to the North Sichuan Road and the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge, the YWCA on Jing'an Temple Road, or the Hu Mansion at 31 Xinhua Garden, Yuyuan Road, and the Chen Mansion at 1 Meiliyuan, Daxilu Road for collection.

### Nanshi Refugee Area Divided into Nine Zones After Improvement to Promote Work

Each Zone to Have a Zone Chief Appointed by the Office; Resident Refugees Selected to Undertake Various Tasks; Refugees Still Lack Clothing and Bedding in the Severe Cold

Since the International Relief Committee and various charitable organizations have made every effort to improve the Nanshi refugee area, everything has become more perfect. In order to facilitate the progress of the work, it has been decided after consultation to divide it into nine zones and work separately. A zone chief will be assigned by the office, and several people will be selected from the residents and refugees in each zone to be responsible for managing cleanliness, supplies, and other matters within the zone. The division of areas is investigated as follows: ㊀ Zone 1: East of Danfeng Road, South of Fuyou Road, West of Minguo Road, North of Fangbang Road; ㊁ Zone 2: East of Anren Street, South of Minguo Road, West of Danfeng Road, North of Wutong Street; ㊂ Zone 3: East of Zhangchuan Road Jiuxiaochang Road, South of Minguo Road, West of Anren Street, North of Fangbang Road; ㊃ Zone 4: East of Panjia Street Houjiabang, South of Minguo Road, West of Zhangchuan Road Jiuxiaochang Road, North of Fangbang Road; ㊄ Zone 5: East of Yanhai Road, South of Minguo Road, West of Houjiabang, North of Fangbang Road; ㊅ Zone 6: East of Shizi Street Jiucang Street, South of Minguo Road, West of Yanhai Road, North of Fangbang Road; ㊆ Zone 7: East of Luxiangyuan Street, South of Minguo Road, West of Shizi Street, North of Fangbang Road; ㊇ Zone 8: East of Qinglian Street, South of Minguo Road, West of Luxiangyuan Street, North of Fangbang Road; ㊈ Zone 9: Southeast of Minguo Road, West of Qinglian Street, North of Fangbang Road. The above nine zones have been delineated, and work is now beginning.

Daily Deaths of Street Refugees Increase

The total number of refugees wandering the streets and lanes is no less than twenty to thirty thousand. They are suffering unspeakable hardships because they have nowhere to be accommodated and are exposed to the elements. Although various organizations in this city have discussed and devised ways to provide relief and resettlement, it has not yet been put into practice. The Shanghai West Union Benefit Association has learned that tens of thousands of refugees are wandering the streets, and the number of deaths due to starvation and disease is increasing daily. In addition to distributing large quantities of clothing and food, the Association has specially hired the traditional Chinese medicine doctor Tao Shaoqing to provide free medical treatment daily, benefiting the refugees. Surgery and free medication are also provided. The Association has issued 2,000 medical treatment vouchers. Refugees with illnesses can go to the Association to receive vouchers for medical treatment. At the same time, we hope that enthusiastic philanthropists from all walks of life will donate as much as possible for medical expenses to facilitate the work. The merit is immeasurable. You can notify by phone 35627 or send to the Association on Gordon Road.

Sick Refugees Sent to Clinics for Treatment

The charitable organization Disaster Relief Association in this city has specially established a clinic on Qipu Road to treat sick refugees, so that sick refugees can be treated at the clinic. Since its establishment, the number of refugees treated by the clinic has been very large. The Association, in view of the fact that refugees in various shelters are often suffering from illnesses, has notified all shelters that if refugees develop illnesses, they should be sent to the clinic for treatment immediately to value life.

Guangdong Refugees Lack Clothing and Bedding

According to the person in charge of the Guangdong Fellow Provincial Association in Shanghai, this Association previously sent 175 refugees, including 50 children, back to their hometowns on the Shandong cargo ship, and 254 people, including 41 children, on the Suzhou cargo ship, totaling 429 people. As for the more than 8,000 refugees in the three shelters of this Association, they still eat two meals of rice every day. Yesterday, the Municipal Council allocated 156 bags of Saigon rice, which is estimated to last for ten days. In the future, this Association will continue to purchase 1,000 bags. However, the weather is cold, and the refugees lack cotton clothing and bedding. In addition to making efforts to solicit donations from fellow provincials, this Association still hopes that people from all walks of life will generously donate to help.

Charitable Joint Association Sends Refugees

The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Relief War Zone Refugee Committee, in view of the severe cold weather in recent days and the fact that cotton clothing has not yet been fully distributed to the refugees in various shelters, has earnestly appealed to all sectors of society to donate as much old clothes and cotton wadding as possible. Furthermore, this Association dispatched more than 200 refugees to Tongzhou at 5:00 AM yesterday morning on the Taikoo Company's Wuhu ship, and more than 400 refugees to Tongzhou at 5:00 AM this morning on the Jardine Matheson Company's Pinghe ship, for transfer back to their hometowns.

Ningbo Refugees Sheltered in Ningbo

The Ningbo Fellow Provincial Association in Shanghai, after closing the Shanghai shelter, still has more than 500 fellow provincial refugees who have no homes to return to. They have now been sent to Ningbo and are being sheltered at the Baiyi Temple there. Yesterday, the Association also sent Mr. Wu Xingfang, carrying relief food and cotton clothing to Ningbo for distribution and assistance. All food and miscellaneous expenses in Ningbo are still borne and supplied by the Association.

### Children's Welfare Association Investigates: 200,000 Refugees in Nanshi Refugee Area Awaiting Relief

80,000 Refugee Children, Most Without Cotton Clothing and Bedding; About 50 Die of Cold and Starvation Every Day

The China Children's Welfare Association is actively rescuing disaster-stricken children and sparing no effort. Recently, in addition to expanding the number of people it can accommodate, the Association sent staff members Zhao Jian and Xu Zuo to the refugee area to investigate the total number of refugees. After several days of efforts, it was estimated that there are a total of 118 large and small shelters in the urban area, sheltering more than 88,000 refugees. More than 38,000 households have registered for bread relief, and more than 60,000 have not registered. There are approximately 3,000 refugees who have not yet been sheltered and are exposed to the elements. The total number of refugees is no less than 200,000, including approximately 30,000 children aged one to four and approximately 50,000 children aged four to fourteen. About one-third of them do not have cotton clothing or bedding. In recent days, they have been suffering from hunger and cold, and the scene is extremely tragic. On average, about 50 people die of cold and starvation every day, half of whom are adults and half of whom are children. The number is truly alarming.

### Various Grain Organizations Purchase Zhejiang Province National Rice

Approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, totaling 300,000 Dan; Rice Merchants Association Negotiates to Improve Retail Method; Ban on Rice Shops Secretly Raising Prices and Selling in Whole Bags

After the Public Concession Municipal Council and the China Southern Rice Industry Company cooperated to purchase foreign rice and transport it to Shanghai to regulate the people's food supply, the fourth batch of 30,000 bags has been loaded onto the Zhejiang cargo ship and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tonight. Various grain organizations have purchased 300,000 dan of national rice from Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo in Zhejiang Province, which has been approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Government. The details are as follows:

Continued Transport to Shanghai

The first, second, and third batches of foreign rice ordered from Saigon by the French Dafu Foreign Firm have arrived in Shanghai and are being sold at retail. The fourth batch of 30,000 bags, loaded onto the Zhejiang cargo ship of the British Taikoo Steamboat Company, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 5:00 PM today and will berth at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. The Public Concession Municipal Council and the China Southern Rice Industry Company have continued to order a large amount of foreign rice from Saigon to transport to Shanghai to regulate the people's food supply. It is also heard that more rice will be transported to Shanghai at the beginning of next month, so the people's food supply should not be difficult.

Improve Retail Sales

In order to regulate the people's food supply through retail sales, the Rice Merchants Association stipulates that each household can purchase rice up to a maximum of one yuan in national currency. Now, because there are too many people queuing, in addition to improving the retail sales method and issuing numbers for sale according to the order of purchase, the chairman of the Association, Zhang Nianxuan, is also negotiating with the Public Concession Municipal Council and the French Concession Municipal Council on concrete ways to improve retail sales and is requesting assistance from the two concession authorities. Once concrete methods have been agreed upon, they will be announced and implemented.

Prevent Cheating

The Public Concession and French Concession authorities received a tip that a small number of rice shops, after receiving foreign rice, are not handling retail sales in accordance with the regulations of the Rice Merchants Association and are secretly raising prices to sell in whole bags. In order to clarify the truth, staff have been dispatched to secretly investigate the numbers and addresses of the 500 rice shops handling retail sales to see if the rice received is being completely sold at retail. If it is found that anyone is not handling sales in accordance with the retail sales method, they will be strictly investigated.

Purchase National Rice

A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned yesterday from the grain industry that members of the Bean and Rice Industry and Miscellaneous Grain Industry Associations are purchasing national rice from Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo in Zhejiang Province, 100,000 dan from each place, totaling 300,000 dan, in order to regulate the food supply for Shanghai citizens. With the certification of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the approval of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and with the assistance of the Public Concession Municipal Council, staff have been dispatched to purchase it and will load it onto foreign ships for transport to Shanghai for sale at a fair price.

### Foreigners Allowed to Collect Items for Five Days

First Hongkou, then Yangshupu; First Obtain a Certificate from the Japanese Consulate

According to the Shen Shi News Agency, as the weather is gradually getting colder, consuls from various countries in this city have repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese military authorities to request the opening of the Hongkou and Yangshupu districts so that foreigners can go to collect clothing and various utensils. It has now been approved by the Japanese side. It is scheduled to be open for five days from yesterday to the first of next month, allowing foreigners to enter. It is also scheduled to open the Hongkou district for these two days, today and tomorrow, and then open the Yangshupu and Huishan districts from the 29th to the first of next month. Anyone going to collect items must first obtain a permit from the Japanese consulate before they can go with the permit. However, Chinese people are still not allowed at all. Starting at 9:00 AM this morning, foreigners went to the area from the Waibaidu Bridge.

### Another Group of Overseas Chinese Returning from Japan Arrives in Shanghai

Carrying a Letter from the Overseas Chinese Relief Association; Fourteen Men and Women Today [sic]

The French postal ship Aramis arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying fourteen Chinese overseas Chinese from Kobe, who were taken care of by a certain fellow provincial organization in this city. They will be sent back to their hometowns today. Here is an account of their situation:

Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

The French postal ship Aramis arrived in Shanghai at 7:00 AM yesterday. The ship carried fourteen Chinese overseas Chinese (the 17th batch) from Kobe, most of whom are from Zhejiang. After the overseas Chinese arrived at the port, they were received by a member of a certain fellow provincial organization in this city and sent to hotels to be temporarily settled. They are scheduled to be sent back to their hometowns today so that they can return to their hometowns early.

Please Take Care of Them

When the overseas Chinese left Japan, the Relief Committee for Poor Overseas Chinese under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Consulate in Yokohama specially prepared a letter to a certain fellow provincial organization in Shanghai. The letter reads: Sirs, There are now fourteen Chinese overseas Chinese from Zhejiang and other provinces, including He Yuanshan, who are returning to their hometowns from Shanghai via the French postal ship Aramis from Kobe on the 24th of this month. At that time, please take care of them to the extent possible so that they can travel quickly. We will be very grateful for your kindness.

### German Peace Ship Once Detained for Smuggling Rice

Released Yesterday Morning and Arrived in Shanghai That Evening; Allowed to Sail to Ningbo as Usual at 3:00 PM Today

The Chinese and Italian Shipping Company's German Peace ship resumed its Shanghai-Ningbo route. The second voyage departed from Ningbo at 2:00 PM on the 25th. Due to excessive passenger congestion, cargo transportation was suspended. It was originally scheduled to depart from Ningbo to Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 26th. Suddenly, an incident of smuggling 1,000 bags of rice for export was discovered. The city defense commander detained the ship for investigation, so it did not depart that day. According to a reporter's inquiry with the company, the ship has now sailed from Ningbo to Shanghai as usual yesterday morning and entered the port at 6:00 PM last night, berthing at the Jinliyuan Wharf. This is the truth about the rumors that the ship was detained in Ningbo. The ship was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai for the third voyage to Ningbo at 3:00 PM yesterday, but it has been delayed by one day and is now scheduled to depart at 3:00 PM today.

### Relief Committee Encourages the Purchase of National Salvation Bonds

The Relief Committee in this city sent a letter to all members yesterday, requesting them to purchase National Salvation Bonds. The original letter reads: Sirs, This Association is responsible for relief matters in the entire city. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Resistance War, it has been leading its subordinates diligently, day and night. For the past three months, the work has been arduous. Fortunately, with the assistance of all sectors of society, we have been able to accomplish our work. We are very grateful. Now, the relief expenses are extremely tight and difficult to sustain. Therefore, a fundraising committee meeting was convened on the 17th of this month to seek fundraising methods. It was decided to obtain 100,000 yuan of National Salvation Bonds from the International Committee of the Red Cross and send letters to enthusiastic people to subscribe separately so that they can be used for investment. We have long admired your reputation and strong patriotism. The promotion of bonds will surely require much effort. We only hope that those who have purchased bonds from banks or other institutions in the past will please change to purchasing from this Association in the future. Both will fulfill their national duties and contribute to the important task of relief. This Association respectfully leads all the wounded soldiers to express our sincere gratitude.

### Four Traffic News from Pudong

Since the opening of ferry services by various foreign shipping companies to maintain transportation between the east and west banks of the Huangpu River, there are a total of three ferry terminals in Pudong: Jiajiajiao, Donggou, and Gaoqiao, for passengers to board and disembark. In recent days, due to the crowding of passengers, business has been quite prosperous. Unexpectedly, one ferry terminal, Jiajiajiao, was suddenly blocked, so after 10:00 AM yesterday, a large number of passengers who wanted to land there were temporarily blocked in the Huangpu River. Then they folded to the nearby Kaiping Bureau and Meifu wharves, but they could not land either. As a result, they were all taken back to Shanghai, and each passenger was refunded two cents. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, Donggou also refused to allow ferries to dock at the same time, with no way to accommodate them. At this point, transportation between the east and west banks of the Huangpu River has become even more inconvenient.

### Government Reorganization in Six Provinces

— Advisable

During this war, our country had several strategic locations that could have been defended but were not. After investigation, the main reason was the unsound political structure. Local officials and baojia organizations in various provinces shouldered the important responsibility of resisting the war. They often fully exposed their original weaknesses. In most of the areas that suffered from the war, political work was either disconnected from military affairs or hindered the progress of military affairs. We don't have to complain about the government today for this unfortunate phenomenon, because the government authorities are correcting the past mistakes in politics one by one. Moreover, adapting to the political conditions of modern warfare, it is gradually maturing in the process of resisting the war.

The recent reorganization of the governments of the six provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi is a sign that the government authorities intend to adapt to the situation of long-term resistance and to refresh the political structure. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the war is developing. The other four provinces are important rear areas for mobilizing manpower and material resources. Of course, the local governments of these six provinces must be strengthened for militarization. The newly appointed provincial chairmen are mostly capable military talents. Among them, Gu Zhutong and Zhang Zhizhong have especially made outstanding achievements in this war. As for the other newly appointed provincial committee members, most of them can also be called capable. After this reorganization, the political structure of the six provinces may be able to avoid all the weaknesses exposed in the early stage of the resistance and expand the people's assistance to the military. This is what we sincerely hope for.

### Market Fluctuations and Respite for Foreign Exchange

Overseas Cables Show Improvement in British and American Exchange Rates; Wheat Orders Surge with Active Settlements

The local foreign exchange market, after trending tightly downward last week, has fortunately seen some respite due to improved British and American exchange rates via overseas cables.  Coupled with end-of-month factors and some swap transactions, the US dollar has gradually rebounded to 29.625 yuan.  Even Citibank and other banks are unloading their holdings.  Subsequently, the Central Bank supplied shillings, which helped to ease the pound sterling exchange rate to 1 shilling and 2 1/4 pence.  From Thursday, local food anxieties intensified.  Flour inventories dwindled, leading to a surge in wheat orders and active settlements. The US dollar subsequently tightened again to around 29.5625 yuan.  Sinfeng, Fuhsin, Tongfu and other flour mills actively settled their accounts.  By yesterday's close, the spot price for pound sterling was 1 shilling and 2 1/4 pence.  November futures were at 2.1875, and December futures were at 1 shilling and 1.90625 pence.  Spot US dollar was at 29.59375 yuan. November futures were at the same price, and December futures were at 28.9375 yuan. The Central Bank's official rates remained at Customs Gold Unit 2.261, pound sterling at 1 shilling and 2 1/2 pence, US dollar at 30 yuan, French franc at 8.90, and German mark at 74.5 yuan.  HSBC's rates were pound sterling at 1 shilling and 2 1/4 pence, US dollar at 29.25 yuan, Hong Kong dollar at 94, German mark at 72.25, and French franc at 8.50. Overall, while this week's foreign exchange market has been extremely volatile, it has generally moved away from a state of panic.

### Robbers Kill Brother and Sister with Guns

Escape from Luodian to Shanghai; Bandits Driven by Greed

Wang A'gen, 35 years old, a resident of Luodian, taking advantage of the height of the battle of Luodian, along with his father and sister, Tao Wang (25 years old) sold all the cattle and miscellaneous items in their home, obtaining over 300 yuan in national currency, and escaped to Shanghai.  They lodged with friends at the Jin Situ Temple on Jessfield Road in western Shanghai. To their dismay, at around 6 PM yesterday, three robbers, all armed with handguns, suddenly arrived and robbed the Wang family of the 300 yuan that was the lifeblood of their existence, taking it from under the pillow of Wang's elderly father.  At that moment, A'gen and his sister, Tao Wang, in desperation, chased after the robbers and embraced two of them, shouting for help.  One of the robbers, seeing his accomplice restrained, opened fire on the Wang siblings, shooting A'gen in the temple and his sister in the mouth, the bullet exiting the back of her head.  Both died instantly.  Their bodies were taken to the hospital by car and then transferred to the morgue for autopsy.

### Swift Resolution of Robbery on Route A Lueger

French Police Detectives Arrest Six Male and Female Robbers

Chen Guangzu, a native of Jiaxing, residing at No. 35, Sanxin Lane, Route A Lueger, in the French Concession, was visited by three male and one female robbers at around 7 AM on the 26th (day before yesterday).  Using the pretext of inquiring about a letter, they forced their way inside. They drew handguns, forbidding anyone from making a sound, and went upstairs into the rooms, ransacking chests and cabinets.  They stole cash, clothing, and other items valued at over 500 yuan before fleeing with the stolen goods.  The victim immediately reported the incident to the French police and requested an investigation.  Around 5 PM that afternoon, Detective Inspectors Jiang Futian and Li Xianyang of the French Police received a tip that the robbers in the case were hiding at No. 76, Hongfu Lane, No. 66, Xin Zha Road, in the Public Concession.  They immediately led detectives Yao Zhupo, Shen Jinshu, and officers Bu Zhenglong, Tao Ronglin, Dai Rongyan, Weng Huanzhang, Lu Dongliang, and others, along with Chinese and Western detectives from the Public Concession, to the address.  They arrested the robbers Jin Mingquan (21 years old, from Songjiang), Xue Gengsheng (26 years old, from Changzhou), Xu A'er (32 years old, from Jiaxing), and female robbers Chen Sanmei (27 years old, from Zhenjiang) and Huang Li (54 years old, from Changzhou). In a rattan basket in Li's home, they found a Mauser pistol and stolen goods such as gold watches and silver ingots. They then proceeded to No. 520 Kangding Road, where they arrested another accomplice, Jiang Zhizhong (29 years old, from Changzhou), and brought them all back to the French Police Station. Yesterday, they were all transferred to the First Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court. Judge Liao presided over the hearing, and the Police Department's lawyers Yao Zhaodi and Chen Ming presented the case, requesting a postponement for further investigation. Detective Tao Ronglin then reported on the progress of the case, stating that Jin had been sentenced to one and a half years for theft, and Xue had been sentenced to eight months, also for theft.  Due to the outbreak of war, they were released from Caohejing Prison and then formed a gang to commit robberies. According to their confessions, Chen Rongsheng initiated the plan. When Jin and Xue robbed the victim's home, they wore old copper washbasins as hats. Seeing that the victim's home had two new copper washbasin hats and a camel hair coat, they discarded their own old hats, each wearing one of the victim's new felt hats and putting on the camel hair coat. The two copper washbasin hats and camel hair coat, which were the subject of the case, were all the victim's stolen goods. A gold watch and silver ingots were found on the female robber Chen Sanmei, which were also stolen goods. According to her confession, she has intimate relations with Jin Mingquan, who asked her to go with him, saying he would recommend her to a factory for work, instructing her to go with him to commit the robbery. Jiang Zhizhong also admitted to participating in the robbery. Chen Rongsheng gave him the Mauser pistol, and after the robbery, he put it in the rattan basket and left it at Huang Li's home. The court verified the report, questioned the defendants, and then ordered a postponement for further hearing on December 8th at 9 AM. The defendants were remanded into custody.

### Directors of Two Relief Centers Sentenced to Five Years for Embezzling Food

Li Rensheng, Director of the Xinhang Relief Center; Gao Shuqing, Director of the Hengfeng Relief Center

Li Rensheng, a Ningbo native who served as the director of the Xinhang Relief Center, under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association, was previously reported for embezzling food intended for refugees, totaling fifty bags of white rice, and selling them to the Sanmao Rice Store at No. 359 Shanhai Pass Road for a price of 669 yuan. After being reported, Chief Detective Huang Fusen of the General Patrol Bureau arrested Li. Lawyers Zhang Shizhu and Jiang Baolian of the Police Department charged Li with embezzlement in the Special No. 1 Court. At the same time, Li Biao (also known as Li Junliang), the person in charge of the Sanmao Rice Store, was also prosecuted for receiving stolen goods. After the interrogation was concluded, Judge Meng Tingke held a court session yesterday morning and announced the judgment. The main text of the judgment stated that Li Rensheng, with the continuous intention of illegally possessing property, embezzled items held for public welfare, and was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, along with a fine of 1,000 yuan. If the fine is converted to labor service, it will be calculated at a rate of 1,000 yuan for six months of labor. Li Biao was found not guilty. Just as this case was coming to an end, the Putuo Road Police Station delivered a completely identical case yesterday morning. It involved Gao Shuqing, a Hangzhou native, 46 years old, who had previously served in the military as a deputy regimental commander. He had now retired. After the Shanghai war, Gao was appointed by the Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association on August 26 as the director of the Hengfeng Relief Center at the intersection of Kangding Road and Rue Massenet in the French Concession. The center was very large, capable of accommodating more than 2,000 refugees, and the consumption of food was also enormous. Recently, due to the shortage of white rice, the General Association switched to issuing flour, which was made into steamed buns for distribution. On the 17th and 21st of this month, Gao requested the supply department to issue a large amount of flour. However, after receiving the flour, Gao embezzled a portion of it and entrusted Li Hongbin, a staff member of the Catholic Church at No. 370 Datong Road, to sell it on his behalf. On the 17th, there were 20 bags, and on the 21st, there were 50 bags, each sold for only 3.25 yuan. At the time, Gao told Li that the flour was entrusted by the factory for sale and did not say that it was obtained through embezzlement, so Li did not suspect anything. On the 24th, Gao obtained vouchers from the Relief Association and retrieved 200 bags of flour from the Yufo Temple warehouse on Penang Road, which were transported to the Hengfeng Relief Center by truck. While passing the Catholic Church, Gao suddenly unloaded 60 bags and entrusted Li to sell them on his behalf. Father Yuan of the church suspected something because the current market price was over 4.5 yuan per bag, but Gao's flour was particularly cheap. He began to investigate, and Yu Xiangqin, the director of the negotiation department of the Relief Association, also found out. Yesterday afternoon, when Gao went to the church to collect the money, it was reported to the Putuo Road Police Station. Detective Chen Xianrong arrested Gao. The remaining 45 bags of the 6,000 bags of flour had not yet been sold, and the proceeds from the 15 bags that had been sold, amounting to 50.22 yuan, were transferred to the police station along with the flour by the church. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. Lawyer Qian Xunjiu of the Police Department presented the case, prosecuting under Article 336 of the Criminal Code. He stated that Gao's behavior was extremely vile and completely inexcusable, requesting that he be severely punished according to the law to serve as a warning to others. When questioned, Gao completely denied the charges. After Judge Su Xiefen questioned him, Gao was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, along with a fine of 3,000 yuan and deprivation of civil rights for five years. The stolen goods and the proceeds from their sale were returned to the original owners.
