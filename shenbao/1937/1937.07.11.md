If the situation continues to escalate, Japan should be held responsible. (Central News Agency, 11:55 AM, 11th)

[Beiping] At 1:15 AM on the 11th, Japanese troops began a second bombardment of Lugou Bridge. Our troops resisted bravely, and the fighting was fierce. The Japanese troops have now retreated.

Over 2,000 troops from the North China Garrison in the Yuhuangmiao, Qinhuangdao, and Nanda Temple areas have also been ordered to assemble, and because the Beining Railway did not allocate vehicles, they have requisitioned vehicles from the pseudo-Fengshan Railway Bureau, intending to wait for orders to move inward. At 6:00 AM on the 10th, artillery from the Suzuki Regiment of the Japanese garrison in Li Mingzhuang, Tianjin, and machine gun squads from the Kayashima Regiment, traveled in dozens of heavy trucks and rushed east to Fengtai and then to Lugou Bridge to reinforce the troops. It is reported that the Kwantung Army has a tough attitude and tends to support the North China Garrison in expanding the situation. The situation in North China has become serious, and the Lugou Bridge incident cannot be resolved as quickly as expected. On the 10th, the Tianjin Japanese Army Headquarters hosted reporters from Tianjin and other places and gave a detailed explanation of the Lugou Bridge battle situation, but did not mention withdrawing troops. According to observations by foreign reporters, the Japanese attitude may be due to the excessive number of casualties among their troops, and they intend to retaliate, turning to a reckless mentality.

Our authorities have stated that they are willing to resolve the matter peacefully throughout, and even though negotiations are unable to proceed, they are determined to make the greatest effort. If it is absolutely necessary, they will have to fulfill their duty to defend the country and deal with the situation. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)

### Japanese Troops Did Not Retreat but Fired on Us

[Beiping] After the Chinese and Japanese troops at Lugou Bridge withdrew simultaneously on the 9th, our troops withdrew to designated locations. However, more than 200 Japanese troops remained near the railway tracks near Lugou Bridge. The Japanese Provisional Headquarters claimed that the bodies of two Japanese soldiers killed in the battle had not been found and that they had to search for them there. Despite repeated negotiations with our side, they ignored us. As a result, a misunderstanding occurred once again at around 9:00 PM on the 9th, and the troops opened machine gun fire on us. This was the faint sound of gunfire heard in the southwest corner of Beiping that night. After our side persuaded them to stop, they stopped. We are still urging them to withdraw from Lugou Bridge as soon as possible to prevent any eventuality. The security of Wanping City has been completely assigned to the security team, and they have begun to maintain order. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)

### Reinforcements for the Japanese Army Arrive from the East in a Steady Stream

[Beiping] After twenty-four hours of tranquility, Japanese troops reappeared in Wanping tonight and began to surround the city. Fierce fighting has broken out between Chinese and Japanese troops, and the situation in North China has suddenly become tense again. This unexpected change has led the Chinese authorities to close all the city gates of Beiping again. Prior to this, there was a half-hour of fierce fighting in the Wanping area, and the sound of artillery could be heard in Beiping. It is said that the Japanese troops heading to Wanping are 600 troops stationed in Fengtai, four tanks, and twenty-seven field guns, as well as a detachment from the pseudo-autonomous region of eastern Hebei. Sandbags and other obstacles have now been placed at all strategic locations in Beiping, and traffic has been stopped at 8:00 PM, with only trucks full of Chinese soldiers leaving the city.

It is rumored that Japanese troops are dismantling roads in Fengtai to obstruct military action. The Japanese army claims that the Chinese army has reoccupied Wanping, so they are attacking fiercely. Tonight, official sources claimed that the Japanese army wants to use Wanping as its military concentration point, and the Chinese army is determined to resist and not allow the Japanese army to occupy the city. The Chinese army has indeed withdrawn according to the agreed-upon method yesterday in order to avoid conflict, but it has not abandoned its right to garrison the city. A Japanese spokesman here tonight said that the Japanese army is creating a situation in Wanping that will prevent such conflicts from recurring, but the spokesman was unwilling to elaborate on what this meant.

### A Report on the Inspection of Wanping City

Japanese Troops Have Not Withdrawn From Wulidian. Detailed Account of the Course of the Conflict.

[Beiping] This reporter went to Lugou Bridge again on the morning of the 10th and arrived at Guang'anmen at 7:00 AM. The gate was half-open, and vegetable vendors and peddlers, due to the two-day traffic disruption, took this opportunity to enter the city, so the pedestrians were particularly crowded. At 7:20 AM, I arrived at Wulidian. Looking at the Japanese army encampment on the Ping-Han Railway tracks, I learned that more than 200 Japanese troops had not withdrawn from the Lugou Bridge area. Some Japanese soldiers were still erecting artillery positions on the high ground, aiming at the Lugou stone bridge and the railway culvert. Japanese soldiers were questioning pedestrians, but they were not very obstructive. Just behind the culvert is Wanping County, and the east gate is still tightly closed, making it impossible to pass through. Only the west gate is half-open, and pedestrians can enter and leave after being interrogated. There are a total of 150 security guards in the city, led by Captain Jia, who, together with County Police Officer Bai Rongguang, are responsible for maintaining order. The general situation is still quite calm, but the shops have not yet opened, and the residents' doors are tightly closed. Everything is still. As for the defense, because our army has withdrawn to the west of the bridge and the Japanese troops who have not withdrawn have set up a temporary headquarters next to the railway tracks only one or two hundred meters away, vigilance cannot be relaxed. According to Wanping County Police Officer Bai Rongguang, after the conflict occurred in the late night of the 7th, the Japanese side sent us a note on the 8th, demanding that everyone from the county magistrate down to the common people withdraw completely before 6:00 AM in order to take over the city. At that time, County Magistrate Wang could not contact his superiors by telephone or telegram, and he only discussed the matter all day with me (Bai claimed) and Battalion Commander Jin, but they were unable to reach a result. The Japanese army had already opened fire, and their target was entirely the county government because the county government roof had a flagpole, which could be used as a standard for their firing. Therefore, the county government was hit by four artillery shells at the same time, and the county magistrate's bedroom, large reception room, and the third section office were destroyed. Later, when the flagpole was removed, the target of the artillery fire was suddenly lost, and it fell mostly on civilian houses. In total, the Japanese army bombarded Wanping County three times: once after 3:00 AM on the night of the 7th, once after 10:00 AM on the morning of the 8th, and once after 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, firing more than 200 artillery shells in total. The exact number of our casualties is still unknown, but more than sixty corpses have been collected and transported to the Changxindian Cemetery for burial. Approximately one hundred and twenty wounded have also been transported to temporary hospitals for treatment. The exact number of Japanese casualties is unknown, but it is not much different from ours. The dead have been transported to Fengtai or Tianjin. From this point of view, this battle cannot be said to be not fierce. After parting with Bai, this reporter went to various streets and alleys for a rough inspection. Because the handover had just begun, the security was still tight, so I could not be completely free. Moreover, it had just stopped raining, and the roads were muddy. Except for the patrols of the security team, there were very few pedestrians coming and going, and the scene was bleak, which only increased anger. Furthermore, because all losses are still being investigated and the people have just recovered from their shock, they are unwilling to chat with outsiders, so it is quite difficult to investigate. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)

[Beiping] A team of about fifty Japanese soldiers is stationed half a mile east of Wanping City, using the railway embankment as cover, while about three hundred soldiers of the 29th Army are stationed on the opposite bank of the Yongding River, defending the western end of Lugou Bridge. The rest have retreated towards Changxindian. This morning, several foreign officials and journalists were stopped and interrogated by Japanese soldiers near Wanping. After declaring that they were not carrying cameras, they were allowed to proceed. Upon reaching Wanping, the traces of artillery fire on the city walls were clearly visible, especially on the east gate, which was hit by Japanese artillery fire on both the fourth and fifth days of the week. About fifty artillery shells landed in the city, and half of the administrative offices were destroyed by the bombing. Fortunately, the people in the office had evacuated a quarter of an hour earlier. The office and a nearby hotel were also hit by Japanese artillery fire. Examining the shell fragments, it can be seen that the artillery used by the Japanese army was 37 mm to 3 inches in caliber. During the fighting on the fourth and fifth days of the week, the 29th Army had 2,000 dead, 20 seriously wounded, and 50 slightly wounded. The Japanese army suffered 10 dead, 2 missing, and 22 wounded. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 10th)

### Anglo-Japanese Negotiations

— Zhang Zhongfu

Before the September 18th Incident, the relationship between Great Britain and Japan was excellent. For the past thirty years, the protection of British interests in the Far East and the Pacific has largely relied on alliances or understandings with Japan. After the September 18th Incident, the British government initially expressed goodwill towards Japan, and then adopted a policy of waiting and seeing. It was not until after the winter of 1934 that the British government had to change its policy in the Far East due to Japan's continuous advancement, and adopted the method of using strength to force Japan to comply. Thus, on one hand, it strengthened the defense of the British Empire in the Far East, and on the other hand, it cooperated with the United States, reached a compromise with Russia, and actively assisted China.

Because Britain's current interests require peace, and because Britain's interests in the Far East require the preservation of China's territorial integrity and the Open Door policy, while also hoping that the problems between China and Japan can be resolved peacefully, Britain is willing to negotiate with Japan and reach a compromise, and also hopes that China and Japan can also reach a compromise. From Britain's standpoint, Anglo-Japanese negotiations are a policy that the British government has long decided on, and there is nothing surprising about it.

As for Japan, since the September 18th Incident, the powerful figures in Japan have believed that the time for Japan to carry out its continental policy has matured, and Japan can do whatever it wants in China without having to worry about opposition from other countries. However, the evolution of the situation has made Japan feel that its past observations were wrong. The reaction to the radical policies adopted by Japan after the September 18th Incident has placed Japan in an isolated position. China's gradual unification, Russia's strengthening of its military preparations in the Far East, the United States' naval construction plan, and Britain's recent active measures over the past thirty months have made Japan unable to advance or retreat. The pro-advancement faction in Japan wants to break this situation, which is why there was the German-Japanese agreement last winter. On the surface, the German-Japanese agreement seems to be beneficial to Japan and can make Japan no longer isolated. However, in essence, the German-Japanese agreement is at least temporarily of no help to Japan. The alliance of fascist countries has instead promoted closer cooperation and determination and preparation for confrontation among Britain, France, the the United States, and other countries. The result of the German-Japanese agreement has not enabled Japan to immediately break through the obstacles encountered by Japan's radical policies.

Because Japan currently lacks the strength to break through the obstacles encountered by Japan's radical policies, Japan's continental policy still cannot be implemented immediately and cannot do whatever it wants in China without having to worry about opposition from other countries, Japan has to change its foreign policy. On one hand, it declared to China that although Japan will not abandon its so-called Hirota Three Principles, it does not want them to be realized immediately at this time. On the other hand, it temporarily abandoned its claim to independently dominate East Asia to Britain, the United States, and other countries and is willing to negotiate with these countries on the China issue, but at the same time, it is working hard to prepare for a major war to await changes in the world's international situation. From Japan's standpoint, Anglo-Japanese negotiations are a compromise policy when Japan currently cannot break through the obstacles encountered by Japan's radical policies.

When it comes to the claims of Britain and Japan regarding China in this negotiation, it is not difficult for us to speculate. In theory, Britain's claim is naturally China's territorial integrity and the Open Door policy in order to protect American interests in China. However, in fact, Britain will naturally not completely disregard Japan's standpoint. The important interests of the United States are concentrated in Central China and South China. For North China, Britain may allow Japan to obtain greater economic interests in fact, but in law, Japan must recognize China's territorial integrity and the Open Door policy. For the four northeastern provinces, Britain may recognize the fact, but China, the the United States, and the League of Nations must recognize it at the same time. As for the issue of the Open Door policy within the four northeastern provinces, Britain's attitude will depend on Japan's business attitude towards Britain and Japan.

As for Japan's claim regarding the China issue in this negotiation, according to my personal observation, Japan's claim is naturally: to recognize the current situation in the four northeastern provinces and to recognize Japan's superior position in North China. However, in fact, since Japan is willing to condescend and negotiate with Britain on the China issue, Japan also cannot completely disregard Britain's standpoint. With regard to Central China and South China, Japan's current strength cannot reach it, so it should not cause major disputes. With regard to North China and the four northeastern provinces, to what extent will Japan retreat? It is impossible to say at this time, which naturally depends on how the international situation and other issues between Britain and Japan are resolved in the future. Generally speaking, for the four northeastern provinces, Japan will insist on maintaining the status quo. As for the Open Door principle within the four northeastern provinces, the puppet state issue, and Japan's request to recognize Japan's superior position in North China, Japan will use it as a bargaining chip for negotiation and make relative concessions.

This Anglo-Japanese negotiation is of course not limited to the China issue, and its impact is of course not limited to Britain and Japan. If this Anglo-Japanese negotiation can continue, we should regard it as a part of the entire world peace negotiation and as the starting point of peace negotiations among countries in the Pacific. The success or failure of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations will affect the entire world's international politics and the relations among countries in the Pacific.

Since the nature of this Anglo-Japanese negotiation is so important and its relationship with China is so close, our government should not only adopt a passive attitude, merely declaring that the Anglo-Japanese negotiations must respect China's territorial integrity, must respect China's opinions, and must obtain China's consent. We should put forward concrete claims and actively engage in diplomatic activities. Our government should at least maintain close contact with the British government during the Anglo-Japanese negotiations to find out the progress of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the China issue and express our country's views on this issue at any time to eliminate understandings that are unfavorable to our country. Opposing an unapproved plan is easier than overturning an approved plan. If we must wait until the Anglo-Japanese understanding has been established before expressing our disagreement, then our country will be in an unfavorable position at that time, and diplomatic progress will be more difficult. I wonder if our diplomatic authorities also think so?

### Anglo-Japanese Business Negotiations Mostly Inconclusive

Only Agreed to Close Cooperation in the Future - Group Discussions Still in Progress

[London] The Federation of British Industries recently issued a public statement regarding its discussions with the Japanese Economic Survey Group, stating, "There are many issues discussed by both parties, among which the most important are ⑴ the issue of restrictions on Japanese goods in most markets of the British Empire, ⑵ whether various industries in Britain and Japan can enter into agreements to cooperate, ⑶ issues of commercial notes and registration regulations. During the discussions, the Japanese representatives pointed out that Japanese cotton textiles are generally subject to unfair and discriminatory treatment in most British dominions. In addition, some dominion governments are restricting most of Japan's trade through their own independent actions, but regardless of how restricted, Japan's export trade volume continues to increase. The British and Japanese sides subsequently agreed that industrial organizations of the two countries should cooperate closely to lay the foundation for entering into agreements for various industries of both sides. The industrial federations of the two countries should be responsible for liaison work so that any industry on either side will not conflict with its counterpart. Both parties also agreed that the industrial federations of the two countries should find ways to exchange information on the scope of industrial sales markets at any time so that it will be easier to implement when an agreement is reached in the future. As for the issue of developing commerce in East Asian countries, both parties believe that the prospect of British and Japanese cooperation there is very broad. Group discussions between both parties are still ongoing, and if necessary, a plenary meeting will be held again at the end of this month." (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 9th)

Soviet and Swedish Foreign Ministers - Toast Each Other for Peace

[Moscow] Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov hosted a banquet for Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler this evening and gave a speech, saying that there are currently two forces in the world, one fighting for peace and the other working for war. Compared with the two, the former is far less determined, strong, and united than the latter. The only way to proceed now is to consolidate various peace potentials. What are the peace potentials? The programs of the League of Nations, mutual assistance pacts, collective security systems, and the principle that peace is indivisible. The conclusion is to advocate strengthening the League of Nations and various peace forces. Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler then gave a reply, saying that although Sweden has not been without disappointment with the League of Nations in the past, it will continue to carry out the strategy of League of Nations cooperation within the scope of the League of Nations in the future.

### China and the U.S. Establish a Gold and Silver Exchange Agreement

Purchasing Gold and Storing It in America to Stabilize Finance - Another Step Forward in Cooperation Between the Two Countries

[Washington] The negotiations between U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau and Chinese Finance Minister H.H. Kung have concluded, and a joint communiqué was issued today stating: "The governments of China and the the United States have now reached an agreement whereby the Chinese government will purchase a large amount of gold from the U.S. Treasury Department. In order to assist the Chinese government in accumulating gold reserves, the U.S. government will also continue to purchase silver from the Chinese government in accordance with the Silver Purchase Act of 1934. The U.S. government will also expand the measures by which the Central Bank of China purchases U.S. dollars to stabilize foreign exchange, under conditions that protect the interests of both countries." The gold purchased by China will still be stored in the the United States for China's financial stabilization plan. Morgenthau also explained that this agreement signifies a closer financial relationship between the two countries and has indirect benefits for the Anglo-American-French monetary agreement. Minister Kung stated that China does not lack foreign exchange but wishes to have more gold than silver in its reserve amounts. It does not matter where these reserves are stored, so it is willing to store the purchased gold in New York. Kung also stated that China's legal tender is backed by 60% cash and 40% treasury bonds. Neither he nor Secretary Morgenthau were willing to announce the total amount of gold purchased to avoid speculation and affecting world gold prices. Morgenthau and Kung then explained the results of last year's U.S. purchase of silver from China, stating: "This matter has benefited both countries due to the agreement reached between the Chinese and U.S. governments last year and is very satisfactory. We are particularly pleased that our cooperation has taken another step forward. Since the implementation of China's currency reform plan and financial stabilization policy, remarkable achievements have been made. Trade between China and the the United States has also seen great development, with the the United States being China's largest trading partner. All of this is welcome to us." Secretary Morgenthau finally expressed his deep gratitude to the Chinese government and people for sending Minister Kung to the the United States in person to negotiate, resulting in today's achievements. Kung finally told reporters that it would be easy for China to borrow from abroad if it wanted to. When asked if the gold purchased by China from the the United States was a loan, Kung replied that this gold was for reserve purposes and that China could seek elsewhere if it wanted to borrow. The discussions with the the United States have now concluded, but he will stay in Washington for one more day tomorrow. Kung today accompanied Chinese Ambassador to the the United States Wang Zhengting to Mount Vernon to lay a wreath at Washington's tomb and bow three times before visiting Washington's former residence and gardens. (National Telegraph of the 9th)

[Washington] Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced that the gold that the the United States should sell comes from two sources: one is the original gold in the the United States that has been nationalized by the Treasury Department, and the other is the excess gold imported into the the United States from foreign countries. Financial circles in the the United States welcomed the new agreement between China and the the United States, saying that the U.S. Treasury has a lot of gold reserves, and some of them cannot be produced, which can be alleviated in the future.

### H.H. Kung Visits Washington's Former Residence

Says Great Men Should Be Close to Nature - Citibank Authorities Invite Kung on a Boat Trip

[Washington] Chinese Finance Minister H.H. Kung told Associated Press reporters after visiting Washington's former residence today: "This trip has moved me very much. I think that great men must be close to nature so that they can stay away from the bustling secular life and be close to the Creator." The Director of the Far East Division of the U.S. State Department, Hornbeck, invited Minister Kung and Ambassador Wang and his daughter to an informal banquet at the Congressional Country Club tonight. (National Telegraph of the 10th)

[Washington] An interesting incident occurred when Chinese Finance Minister H.H. Kung spoke with reporters at the U.S. Treasury Department today, which is enough to demonstrate the calmness of the Chinese people. During the interview, a photographer's flash bulb suddenly exploded with a loud noise, and glass shards scattered everywhere. Miss Clowes, the secretary of U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, was startled and turned pale. However, Minister Kung remained calm and composed like Confucius, and without saying a word, he used his hand to remove the glass shards from Miss Clowes' chair and Secretary Morgenthau's desk. Reporters from various newspapers praised this as a good story. (National Telegraph of the 9th)

### Joint Declaration by Chinese and American Finance Ministers

[Washington] After the final talks between Dr. H.H. Kung, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of China, and US Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. yesterday, both parties issued a joint declaration to the press, stating that the monetary cooperation established in May 1936 between representatives of the US Treasury and the Chinese Ministry of Finance has greatly contributed to the smooth implementation of China's new currency system. This has benefited both the Chinese domestic economy and US trade. We can now announce that the monetary cooperation between China and the United States will be further advanced to continue the understanding reached a year ago. We believe that the monetary policy pursued by the Chinese National Government is not only based on a sound foundation but also an important step towards the goal of global currency stability. To increase our efforts to achieve this goal and to maintain cooperation in currency reform and currency stabilization, and in accordance with our silver purchase policy, we have resolutely expressed our willingness to purchase a large amount of silver from the Central Bank of China under mutually acceptable conditions, and to enable the Central Bank of China to obtain US dollars to stabilize the currency under conditions that protect the interests of both China and the United States. We firmly believe that the new plan for currency reform adopted by the Chinese government and the measures agreed upon with the United States are sufficient to guarantee the stability of the Chinese currency and thereby promote the improvement and prosperity of China's national economy. Both parties have agreed that the Chinese government will purchase a large amount of gold from the United States to help the Chinese government increase its gold reserves, and in accordance with the US Silver Purchase Act of 1934, the US Treasury will continue to purchase silver from the Chinese government. The US Treasury also intends to expand the scope of the measures previously agreed upon, namely, the conditions under which the Central Bank of China can obtain US dollars to stabilize its currency while protecting the interests of both China and the United States. The Finance Ministers of China and the United States are deeply satisfied with the results that benefit both countries. This result is due to the understanding reached between the two countries last year. Both China and the United States are especially pleased to announce further cooperation between the two countries. The reform of China's currency system and the stability of its currency have been a great success. Consequently, China's trade with other countries, especially with the United States, which ranks first in China's international trade, has increased. The current talks have come to an end. The US Treasury Secretary is sincerely pleased to have had the opportunity to personally contact the Chinese Finance Minister and discuss the promotion of the well-being of both countries. It is reported that during the Sino-American talks, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Wang Zhengting, the Director of the Bureau of International Trade, Guo Bingwen, and experts from the US Treasury Department were present.

### Palestine

Report Submitted to the League of Nations

[Geneva] The Secretariat of the League of Nations has received the report of the Palestine Question Committee from the British government and has been asked to make arrangements so that the Permanent Mandates Commission can meet on July 30 to discuss the recommendations in the report to change the terms of the Palestine Mandate. Therefore, the Secretariat has asked the Council members to send written statements before July 15 stating whether they agree that the Permanent Mandates Commission should issue a temporary opinion and that the issue should be returned to the Mandates Commission for discussion after the Council meets in September, without any obstacles. Before the report is submitted to the Mandates Commission, both houses of the British Parliament will likely debate it. As it stands, the majority of members of the House of Commons support the plan to divide Palestine into three parts. Although the details will certainly be debated fiercely, many see this as the only practical solution to the problem. (Reuters dispatch, 9th, Central News Agency)

Jerusalem Today, some people interviewed King Abdullah of Transjordan, asking for his opinion on the British Committee's report. Abdullah said that the recommendations in the report are the best solution to the Palestine issue under the current circumstances. It is understood that Abdullah is one of the four Arab kings, the other three being the King of Saudi Arabia, King Ghazi of Iraq, and Imam of Yemen. It is also understood that the report recommends that Arab land in Palestine should be merged with Transjordan as far as possible. (Reuters dispatch, 9th, Central News Agency)

### Signing of the Franco-German Trade Agreement

Trade Based on Most-Favored-Nation Status Effective Next Month with a Term of Two Years

[Paris] The Franco-German trade negotiations, which have been going on for several months, have recently been declared concluded, and both parties have reached a trade agreement. Its contents are: ⑴ The trade agreement is based on the most-favored-nation clause. ⑵ The goods price settlement agreement will abolish the current barter system and replace it with the usual international method. Regarding this point, the number of French exports to Germany has been small in the past due to Germany's large debt on goods prices, but it can now be restored to its original state. In addition, France and Germany will organize a joint committee to hold regular meetings so that the goods price settlement method can be kept in balance and there will be no more arrears. As for the principal and interest of the Dawes and Young loans, they should still be paid in accordance with the current methods. (It is noted that Germany has reduced the interest rate on the Dawes loan from 7.5% to 5%, and plans to reduce the interest rate on the Young loan from 5% to 4.5%). Furthermore, a solution has also been agreed upon for the problem of the transfer of French claims against Germany. The above two agreements will take effect on August 1st, with a valid period of two years. (Havas dispatch, 10th, Central News Agency)

[Paris] The Franco-German trade treaty was signed today at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs by French Foreign Minister Delbos and Ambassador Welczek. The treaty will take effect on August 1st for a term of two years. After the new treaty is signed, the trade agreement signed in 1934 will be declared invalid. The new treaty includes a list of goods enjoying customs privileges in the trade between the two countries, as well as most-favored-nation treatment clauses. There are also regulations regarding the quota of German goods imported into France. The treaty restores the situation before 1934. As for German imports from France, Germany will receive a large supply of raw materials. Under the goods agreement, the exchange of French iron ore and German cork, as well as France's supply of colonial timber to Germany, are specifically noted. The relations between other French colonies and Germany will also be resolved based on most-favored-nation treatment. As for repayments, they will be based on foreign currency.

### France Decides to Abolish Border Monitoring of Spain

But Contraband Will Still Not Be Allowed Through The UK Continues to Mediate with Various Countries

[Paris] Official circles have recently announced that the French government will notify the London Adjustment Committee on the 12th of this month that the current international monitoring measures at the French-Spanish border should be terminated from the 13th. However, all items prohibited by the Adjustment Committee will still not be allowed to be transported to Spain. In addition, the obligations accepted by France in accordance with the Non-Intervention Agreement will remain in effect. It is noted that this method is temporary in nature and will be revoked once the conditions proposed by French representative Couve de Murville at the plenary meeting of the Adjustment Committee yesterday are met. (Havas dispatch, 10th, Central News Agency)

[London] After the British government accepted the entrustment of the Adjustment Committee to find a compromise solution between the British and French monitoring plans and the German and Italian counter-proposals, Foreign Secretary Eden has separately ordered British envoys stationed in various European countries to immediately inquire about the opinions of the governments of those countries. At the same time, Foreign Secretary Eden will also hold talks with the envoys of various countries stationed in the UK. It is generally known that the purpose of the UK's inquiry is to first reach an agreement on the issue of the withdrawal of volunteers from various countries, and then it is hoped that other issues can be resolved through compromise. Afterwards, it is planned to apply to both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War, so that each party will allow international monitors to carry out their duties in Spanish ports. If this method cannot become a reality, then another maritime monitoring plan may be proposed, and neutral countries will be invited to participate. (Havas dispatch, 9th, Central News Agency)

### Non-Intervention Committee Asks UK to Continue Mediation

Debate Between French, Russian, German and Italian Representatives UK Representative Also Makes Blunt Remarks

[London] The maritime monitoring plan of the Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War has reached a stalemate because Germany and Italy withdrew, leaving a void, and Germany and Italy opposed the filling of the void by the British and French navies. The committee has now entrusted the UK to take on the responsibility of mediation. Today, the plenary meeting of the Non-Intervention Committee passed the Dutch Minister's proposal to entrust the Chairman of the Committee, Plymouth, to find a way to break the current stalemate. During the meeting, the French Ambassador stated that if the balance of the monitoring plan could not be maintained for a long time, France would stop the international monitoring in the Pyrenees region. However, no applicable mediation method has yet been proposed. While the UK and France insisted on their original positions, Germany and Italy insisted on granting the rights of belligerents to the Spanish Nationalist forces and issued extremely harsh comments to the British government. Chairman Plymouth stated at the meeting today that the UK found it difficult to accept the criticisms from the outside world, because if all countries could abide by the letter and spirit of the Non-Intervention Agreement as consistently as the UK, then the situation in Spain today would not be like this. Therefore, the failure of the four countries to cooperate today is not the fault of the UK. The urgent task at present is how to re-establish the second line of defense in the monitoring plan. Furthermore, the withdrawal of volunteers is very important in the eyes of Europe and the world. If this matter cannot be resolved, then the resolution of the Spanish question will also be almost impossible. Plymouth also said that almost none of the speeches by the representatives of the various countries were constructive. If any country can propose a method that is more practical than the new British and French plan, the UK would be willing to consider it. However, as it stands, if a spirit of cooperation cannot be achieved, then a resolution will also be impossible. But if the UK takes on the responsibility of mediation, then speed is of the essence. The representatives of Germany, Italy and France each declared that they would continue to maintain the attitude they had expressed. The Soviet Ambassador declared his support for the British and French position, while the Portuguese Ambassador said that the Portuguese government was willing to respect any satisfactory resolution. Following the unanimous approval of the General Assembly, the UK was asked to take on the responsibility of mediation. Mr. Plymouth said that the British government deeply understood the seriousness of the current situation, so if a good outcome was to be achieved in this matter, all related countries must provide the maximum possible cooperation. Finally, it was decided to convene another meeting at the earliest possible date next week so that the results of the British government's efforts could be reported to the General Assembly. Furthermore, London believes that the negotiations have not broken down, and now the good results of the meeting far exceeded what was expected at the beginning of the meeting. (Reuters dispatch, 9th, Central News Agency)

[London] The delegations of various countries believe that the atmosphere was once tense after the speech delivered by the Italian representative Grandi this morning, but now the situation has greatly improved. According to the previous telegram, the first part of Grandi's speech has been detailed, and the last part mentioned the issue of the withdrawal of volunteers from various countries, saying that the withdrawal of volunteers may not shorten the Spanish Civil War, and the Italian government is not willing to let its people, who have sacrificed their lives for their beliefs, abandon them. He concluded by saying that Italy is determined to limit the scope of the Spanish Civil War and not allow it to expand, and will uphold the policy of non-intervention. Subsequently, the Portuguese representative Monteiro spoke, saying that if the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War could recognize them as belligerents, it would greatly enhance the effectiveness of the non-intervention measures. The Soviet representative Maisky then spoke, firmly rejecting the counter-proposals put forward by Germany and Italy and fully supporting the British and French monitoring plan, and said that the Spanish maritime monitoring plan was the main factor in the non-intervention measures. "In summary, the Spanish Civil War is a disguised war by Germany and Italy against the legitimate government of Spain." Subsequently, the German representative Ribbentrop delivered a speech, fiercely criticizing the attitude adopted by the Soviet Union and involving the role of the Comintern before and after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Regarding the British and French monitoring plan, he said that since his country did not recognize the Spanish Nationalist government, the plan lacked the spirit of neutrality. As for the argument that recognizing the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War as belligerents would only benefit the Nationalist forces, it was also inaccurate. "Furthermore, the Adjustment Committee should not handle the issue of the Spanish Civil War with preconceived notions, favoring one side and hating the other." He concluded by saying that Germany and Italy do not want a communist regime to be established in Spain, and few other countries would support it. Subsequently, the representatives of other countries successively expressed their opinions, all supporting the plans proposed by the UK and France, but at the same time hoping to find a way to satisfy all the countries concerned. The British representative, Lord Plymouth, spoke last, refuting the German and Italian representatives' claim that the UK was biased, and also said that the British and French monitoring plan advocated that neutral personnel should board monitoring warships to inspect them. This was to ensure the faithful implementation of the monitoring measures. As for the proposal put forward by Germany and Italy to recognize the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War as belligerents, it could not be used to replace the monitoring plan, so the UK was not in a position to accept it. The UK agreed with the French position. (Havas dispatch, 9th, Central News Agency)

### Hitler Convenes Meeting

Göring and Neurath Were Both Called to Participate

[Berlin] Political figures here are taking a reserved attitude towards the results of yesterday's plenary meeting of the London Adjustment Committee and are unwilling to comment. Hitler has decided to convene an emergency meeting in Berchtesgaden today, which will be attended by Air Minister Göring and Foreign Minister Neurath. It is noted that Hitler always announces his important decisions on Saturdays and Sundays, and today is also Saturday, so it is not known whether a major historical event will occur. Although Hitler's aides have denied this, it should be known that Hitler has never been willing to adopt the opinions of his aides. It is noted that yesterday the chairman of the London Adjustment Committee, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Sir Plymouth, issued a statement publicly opposing the counter-proposals put forward by Germany and Italy. The UK is eager for the Spanish issue to be resolved quickly on the basis of the British and French understanding. Although the German representative, Ambassador to the UK Ribbentrop, issued a statement at the meeting, it was still rejected. Furthermore, the news about the Adjustment Committee meeting published in today's newspapers, in which the statement made by Plymouth was all censored, only stated that the German representative Ribbentrop "vehemently refuted" the Soviet representative Maisky. The implication is that if the Soviet representative attends the Adjustment Committee again, Hitler will threaten to withdraw from the Adjustment Committee, which is quite noteworthy.

[Berlin] The Führer Hitler has convened Air Minister General Göring and Foreign Minister Neurath to hold important talks in Berchtesgaden tomorrow. General Göring was originally scheduled to deliver a speech in Stuttgart tomorrow, but it has now been canceled. German political figures said that the foreign newspapers' sensational speculations about the talks between Führer Hitler and Göring, Neurath, etc. are all untrue. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)

[London] The German official news agency published an article stating that, according to the authorities, Foreign Minister Neurath's current reporting to London would be of no benefit. It is noted that British Prime Minister Chamberlain said in a speech in London a few days ago that he deeply regretted that the changes in the overall situation had caused Neurath to postpone his visit to the UK, and hoped that there would be an opportunity in the future for both parties to discuss and bring their opinions closer together. The news agency published the above after the British Prime Minister's speech. (Reuters dispatch, 9th, Central News Agency)

### Lansbury Visits Italian Prime Minister

Wearing a White Belt with "Peace" Written on It

[Rome] British Labour MP Lansbury, who had previously visited US President Roosevelt, German Führer Hitler, and politicians from France and the Scandinavian countries to conduct private talks on the "economic causes" of war, arrived here yesterday to pay his respects to Prime Minister Mussolini. The meeting lasted three quarters of an hour before it ended. He also made a statement to the newspapers, saying that the most important thing discussed was his proposal to convene a defense conference to study the economic methods to solve political difficulties. He will also visit the Prime Minister again on Monday or Tuesday. When asked whether the impression he got after meeting with Mussolini was the same as after visiting the German Führer Hitler, he said "The two are completely different." (Havas dispatch, 9th, Central News Agency)

[Rome] British Labour MP Lansbury arrived in Rome today and was immediately received by Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Count Ciano. The three held talks in English for forty-five minutes. It is noted that Mr. Lansbury traveled a long distance in the hot weather, and immediately after arriving in Rome, he drove to the Venice Palace. Mr. Lansbury was wearing a white belt with the word "Peace" written on it and was holding a felt hat. He was led up the Guan stairs and into the marble grand hall to meet with Mr. Mussolini. Upon arriving there, infantrymen with skulls and crossbones painted on their chests drew their swords and saluted. Mr. Lansbury served as Minister of Labour in the MacDonald Labour Cabinet from June 1929 to August 1931. (Reuters dispatch, 9th, Central News Agency)

### Japanese Troops' Surprise Attack on Wanping: The Course of Events

Japanese troops requested to enter the city late at night to search for a missing soldier; our troops immediately and sternly refused due to its unreasonableness; Japanese troops attacked several times and reinforced Fengtai.

Tianjin Dispatch, Morning of the 8th: The 29th Army stationed at Lugouqiao in Wanping was suddenly attacked by Japanese troops. The situation became extremely serious for a time. The causes and effects of the incident are described below.

Remote Cause of the Incident

Since the 29th Army was unreasonably forced by Japanese troops to withdraw from Fengtai last year, it has been stationed on the banks of the Yongding River in Wanping County. One battalion and three companies of infantry from Feng Zhi'an's 37th Division are stationed inside and outside the city. The area is more than 30 li from Beiping, 7 li from Fengtai, and about 3 li from Lugouqiao. It is located at the intersection of the Pinghan, Pingsui, and Beining railways, and occupies a strategic position. The Japanese troops stationed in Fengtai have repeatedly demanded that the authorities withdraw the troops stationed there and cede Changxindian because Commander Feng's troops are stationed there. Our side immediately refused. Last winter, in order to expand the Fengtai barracks and increase the number of troops stationed there, the Japanese side planned to build a military fortress between Lugouqiao, Changxindian, and Wanping County, to serve as a strategic point for the troops stationed in Fengtai and to facilitate monitoring of our troops stationed in Wanping and along the Yongding River. Later, due to public opposition, people requested the authorities to negotiate and stop this plan. The Japanese side's wishes were not fulfilled. However, the Japanese side never stopped dreaming of realizing this plan.

Pretext for the Conflict

In the past week, the Japanese troops stationed in Fengtai, the troops of Kaita and Ichiki, two major detachments of cavalry and infantry, have been conducting exercises and demonstrations near Lugouqiao every day. Our troops have been tolerant and have not engaged them. On the evening of the 7th, one company of Kaita's troops again conducted night combat exercises at Lugouqiao. After the exercise, a roll call revealed that one outpost cavalryman was missing. According to the Japanese side's subsequent statement, they suddenly heard a gunshot from inside Wanping County. Using this as a pretext, they claimed that the troops stationed in Wanping County had fired at Japanese soldiers, and that the missing soldier had been killed by our side. Therefore, they requested to enter the city for a search. Our troops refused because it was midnight and all the residents were asleep, fearing that a disturbance would disrupt public order. Matsui, the head of the Japanese military intelligence agency stationed in Beiping, based on Kaita's report, telephoned Qin Dechun, requesting him to order Wanping County to open the city gates. He also replied with the aforementioned reasons. Subsequently, Matsui telephoned Qin again, saying that if the Japanese troops were not allowed to enter the city, they would send an armed guard team into the city. At the same time, the Wanping County garrison and the commissioner's office also telephoned Qin, reporting that the Japanese troops had increased to four or five hundred and were encircling Wanping County, hoping for a quick negotiation to stop the attack. Qin then notified Matsui, requesting that he quickly send personnel to assist the Jicha Council to send people to investigate and dissuade. Matsui then sent his deputy agency chief Terahira, the commander of the First Infantry Regiment stationed in Beiping, Kurumaguch, the Japanese military advisor to the Jicha Council, Sakurai, the Wanping commissioner Wang Lengqi, the Jicha Committee Councilor Lin Gengyu, the Jicha Transportation Committee Councilor Sun Yongye, and others to the scene of the incident by car.

Large-Scale Encirclement and Attack

After Terahira arrived, he abandoned his investigation mission and, on behalf of Kaita, reiterated the previous demands. While they were arguing, gunfire suddenly erupted at the east gate, and cannon fire began at the west gate, mixed with machine gun fire. Our defending troops initially tried their best to remain calm. However, seeing that the pressure from the other side was gradually increasing and the artillery fire was becoming denser, they bravely resisted. The two sides fought until about nine o'clock, when the gunfire began to subside. About one platoon of our troops stationed near the Dragon King Temple at Lugouqiao failed to retreat and were disarmed by the Japanese troops. After the conflict subsided slightly, our side inspected the casualties and found that there were more than 20 dead and wounded. The Japanese side had more than 10 dead and wounded, including a squad leader. At this time, the authorities in both Beiping and Tianjin had learned of the incident and contacted each other by telephone, ordering their respective troops to stop the attack. However, the Japanese troops lay down in skirmish lines in the bushes on the banks of the Shuiding River, waiting for an opportunity. Mutaguchi demanded that our troops stationed in Wanping immediately withdraw, and that the troops on the banks of the Yongding River must also withdraw. We refused. At 11:30, the negotiations still yielded no results, and the conflict resumed. However, it stopped shortly afterwards, and negotiations continued. The Japanese side's demands remained the same. However, they had already stated that the missing soldier had returned to the team and stopped talking about the 29th Army shooting their soldiers. They only acknowledged that the 29th Army had engaged in anti-Japanese behavior and must withdraw. We insisted that the Japanese troops must return to their original defense positions before other matters could be discussed. The negotiations ultimately broke down. At 3:00 PM, the conflict broke out again. It stopped again at 3:30 PM. Mutaguchi then issued an ultimatum to Wang Lengqi and the troops stationed in Wanping City, demanding that they withdraw by 6:00 PM, or they would launch a large-scale attack. We ignored the ultimatum. Until 6:00 PM, the Japanese side did not take much action. At around 8:00 PM, gunfire resumed. The situation afterwards was unclear. It was reported that Zhang Zizhong had rushed to the scene of the incident by car at 10:00 PM to investigate and planned to find a way to prevent the escalation of the situation.

Japanese Troops Reinforce

After receiving the report, the Japanese Army Headquarters stationed in Tianjin convened an emergency meeting at 6:00 AM on the 8th. Since Tashiro was ill, Hashimoto took over as chairman and invited senior officers to discuss the matter. They then sent the first section chief Wachi and staff officer Adachi to Beiping by car to negotiate with Qin Dechun in cooperation with Matsui. At the same time, more than 300 Japanese infantry soldiers drove to Wanping in heavy-duty trucks to reinforce the troops. More than 50 logistical troops then requisitioned a special train on the Beining Railway at about 1:00 PM to transport a large number of weapons and ammunition to Fengtai for transfer to the front. They later planned to send more troops and requisitioned a train on the Beining Railway. The railway refused. Director Chen Juesheng also ordered all railway staff that, under these circumstances, they could not allocate trains for the Japanese side. Therefore, as of the evening of the 8th, no more Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin had been dispatched. There are currently more than 1,000 Japanese troops stationed in Fengtai, more than 1,000 in Tongzhou, and more than 800 in Beiping. Our troops stationed in Beiping, Tongzhou, Lugouqiao, and Changxindian amount to approximately two brigades and three regiments. The Japanese brigade commander Kawabe is currently in Fengtai, and the regimental commander Mutaguchi is outside Wanping City. This situation of confrontation and conflict seemed to have intensified into the night. The Japanese Army Department stationed in Tianjin was still holding a meeting at Haiguang Temple at midnight.

Traffic Situation

On the morning of the 8th, long-distance telephone communication between Beiping and Tianjin was interrupted once, but it was restored at 6:00 AM. However, due to the excessive number of callers throughout the day, it was difficult to transmit messages. The passenger trains on the Beining Railway from Beiping to Tianjin were not obstructed in the morning. However, the third, fifth, and third trains of the third day were delayed by about an hour because the 29th Army was inspecting travelers near Yongdingmen to prevent spies from taking the opportunity to infiltrate and cause disturbances. After 9:00 AM, it was reported that a section of the railway tracks near Fengtai had been deliberately dismantled by our troops to prevent enemy troops from attacking. The passenger trains from Tianjin to Beiping, except for one that arrived in Beiping at 2:00 PM, all arrived in Huangcun first, waiting for a telephone call from Fengtai to confirm that there were no obstacles before proceeding. However, upon reaching Fengtai, they were prevented from entering Beiping City by the front line and were all turned back from Fengtai. Passengers did not disembark. At 8:00 PM on the evening of the 8th, Beiping was placed under martial law. Feng Zhi'an, Shao Wenkai, and Chen Jiyan were appointed as deputy commanders of martial law. All city gates were closed, leaving only Zhengyangmen open for entry and exit. The inspection of pedestrians was very strict. After Song Zheyuan received the news in Leling, in addition to reporting to the central government, he ordered Men Zhizhong, the chairman of the Jicha Construction Committee who was going to see him, to return to Beiping at noon on the 8th to convey his intentions to Qin Dechun and others. At that time, senior officers of the 29th Army, Zhang Zizhong and Feng Zhi'an, were in Beiping presiding over everything. Although the atmosphere was extremely tense between Tianjin and Beiping, people were not agitated.

Japanese Troops Demonstrate

At 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, more than 30 armored vehicles, more than 10 tanks, and hundreds of infantry and artillery soldiers from the Japanese Army stationed in Tianjin were divided into two groups and paraded along Dajing Road in Hebei, Tianjin, and Jintang Road in the Special No. 2 District. The road surface was damaged by the tanks. The parade lasted for a while before returning to camp. At noon, three Japanese military aircraft converted from Huitong circled over the city of Tianjin, and soon flew along the Beining Railway towards Fengtai. From the attitude of the Japanese Army Headquarters here, it is clear that the Japanese side is eager to occupy the area and has the ambition to do so. However, the 29th Army's serious attitude and fierce resistance were far beyond the Japanese side's expectations. (8th)

### Suzhou

Commencement of Reconstruction of the Four City Gates

The city's road expansion plan is being actively promoted. The Lou, Qi, Pan, and Wu four city gates will be reconstructed starting on the 10th and will be completed in approximately three months. The widening of Hulong Street, Lindun Road, and Qimen Road, the main roads, is scheduled to begin on the 11th. Additionally, 13 bridges of various sizes are scheduled to be reconstructed simultaneously on the 21st, using steel and concrete. The buildings on both sides of the main roads must be demolished and vacated by the 15th.

Parricide Case Occurs in Suzhou Village

Zhang Bingchu, a farmer from Dazhaiji Village, Jinshu, Suzhou Township, died suddenly on June 27th. At the time, the deceased's sons, Renjun and Junwan, and the deceased's younger brother, Zhang Huichu, all claimed that he had died by hanging and did not report it for investigation. After the burial, rumors spread in the village that he had been murdered by his two sons and brother. Therefore, the local police station detained Zhang Huichu, Zhang Renjun, and Zhang Junwan and sent them to the city for interrogation by the district procuratorate. On the 10th, the police dispatched officers to transport the coffin to the city. Prosecutor Zhang and inspector Xuan Fang opened the coffin outside the North Gate in the afternoon to examine the body. The examination revealed that there were many wounds on the body. The coroner's report was filled out and submitted for further investigation.

### Wuxi

Further Details on the Gunfight Between Police and Bandits

Following the tragic gunfight and bloodshed between police and bandits that occurred at Renshou Lane, Gongyun Bridge, on the afternoon of the 7th, the injured were sent to Tongren and Xiongdi hospitals for treatment. According to the bandit Zhang Songda, the shooting of police officer Ni Abing and others was accidental. The bandit is now in critical condition and may develop peritonitis, putting his life in danger. The four people who were injured by the bandits, Ni Abing, Liu Changfa, Wang Taoshi, and Wu Zhongyi, are in better condition and should recover without major complications. The four suspects arrested by the county police bureau, Wang Heshang, Gao Asan, Zou Qiaoyun, and Wang Agen, have been taken into custody for investigation.

Wheat Boat Robbed in Wuxi

Yu Jifeng Rice Shop in Gaoshengzhen, Yixing, hired a barge owned by Jiang Rushan on the 6th of this month, loaded with 180 dan of wheat, to be transported to Yuanchang Rice Shop in Sanliqiao, Wuxi, for unloading. As it was getting late when they arrived at the Beixinqiao area near Luoshe, Wuxi, they anchored there for the night. They continued sailing at 4:00 AM the next morning. Unexpectedly, when they reached Gaomingqiao, more than 30 li from the city, they were suddenly attacked by a pirate ship. More than a dozen pirates, each wielding a broadsword, jumped onto the wheat boat, tied up Jiang Rushan and his son with ropes, and forbade them from making any noise. They ransacked the boat at will. After about an hour, they escaped with the loot towards Changzhou. After the incident, it was discovered that more than 70 dan of wheat had been robbed, resulting in a loss of more than 600 yuan. On the 9th, Jiang Rushan, the boat owner, reported the incident to the county police bureau, requesting the arrest of the robbers and the recovery of the stolen goods.

### Taizhou

Linhai Wheat Exports

In Linhai City, merchants are buying up all available wheat, regardless of quantity, causing the price of wheat to rise. It is reported that the wheat buyers are reselling to a certain party. In the past three or four days, approximately 4,000 bags of wheat have been loaded and exported. There has been a lot of rain this summer, which has damaged the early rice crop. The large-scale export of wheat is causing concern about the food supply for the people.

### Huaiyin

Planning to Build a New Electric Light Plant

The electric light plant established by the Jiangsu Construction Department in Huaiyin is operating very successfully. Because the original plant site has no room for expansion, a new plant is being planned in Zhongzhou under Qingjiang Dam. A staff member has been sent to Shanghai to negotiate for larger machinery that can supply more than 10,000 light bulbs to meet the demand. It is reported that the new plant site has been leveled, and the construction project has been contracted to Lu Shengji for 22,000 yuan. The funds will be provided by the province, and construction is scheduled to begin in late June and be completed by the end of November this year.

### Zhenjiang

Transfer of County Police Officers for Training

The Jiangsu Provincial Police Academy's current class of police officers and cadets is about to graduate. It is reported that the Department of Civil Affairs will transfer existing police officers from various counties to the province for training, in accordance with the department's order. No new police officer students will be recruited. The cadet class will also transfer existing senior police officers from various counties to the province for training.

### How to Mobilize Down to the Countryside to Build Rural Areas (Continued)

— Wu Tiecheng

(Speech given at the joint meeting of various Guangdong Provincial Government agencies to discuss the mobilization of rural construction on June 28th)

Elementary school principals and teachers can provide nearby guidance to the township head in handling all township affairs, serving as consultants and guides for the township head and the township office. They can also help with the literacy campaign. The security team can help the township head organize the Baojia system and train the young men, so that the security team can become integrated with the rural community. To achieve this goal, I think that after the young men complete their three-month training, they should be incorporated into the security team for in-service training. After one year, they should be discharged and become a reserve force. This will not only ensure that the young men's training is effective, but also create a close relationship between the security team and the local community. At the same time, it will also lay the groundwork for the implementation of the conscription system. Secondly, Guangdong has many barren mountains. Guangdong is not only experiencing a rice shortage, but also a serious fuel problem. We in Guangdong only know how to cut down trees and do not know how to plant them. If this continues, we will eventually run out of fuel. If we do not plan for this early, it will be terrible in the future. Therefore, the afforestation movement is also a major urgent task in Guangdong. Afforestation can not only solve Guangdong's fuel problem, but also prevent droughts and floods. Now that the Guangdong Provincial Paper Mill is about to start production, it will need a lot of wood every day after it starts production. Therefore, this problem is a very serious one. We must plan for it in advance. Therefore, our government is now preparing to create a provincial-level afforestation plan for all localities. We need what kind of wood, and we will plant what kind of forest throughout the province. After the plan is drafted, we will implement this work. We also want our security team to participate directly. Currently, we have 41 security teams in the province, totaling nearly 20,000 people, distributed throughout the province. In addition to retaining a portion to maintain local autonomy, the rest can be rotated out to do some local business, such as training young men, reclaiming wasteland for afforestation, and helping the people build simple flood control projects, etc.

As I just said, I want to use the schools in each county as the center of our rural construction movement. But we are afraid that there are many villages in each county that do not have schools, or even if they do, they are poorly organized and the knowledge and abilities of the principals and teachers are very shallow, which is not enough to take on this responsibility. There are originally 13,998 townships and 784 towns in Guangdong Province. Now we are abolishing the district system and changing it to a joint township autonomy system. After the joint township autonomy system is changed, all townships will be reduced in size. As a result of the reduction, from 13,998 townships, there will be 4,846 townships, and from 748 towns, there will be 263 towns. One township is a small unit. Guangdong has 4,846 townships, which means there are 4,846 units. Averaging 97 counties, each county has an average of more than 400 townships. In other words, a county government has to command more than 400 units. If there is no organization in the unit, or the organization is not sound, if there is a very sound school in this unit at this time, this school can serve as a consultant and guide for a town or township. However, according to the investigation by the Education Department, not all counties, towns, and townships have schools. Even if there are schools, they are very simple and cannot afford this important task. Therefore, I came up with a remedial measure. This remedial measure is that I want to recruit students who have passed the junior high school level in this province, train them for six months, nine months, or one year (the length of time will be determined based on the amount of courses), and instill in them various necessary simple knowledge and skills, such as local self-government cooperation, afforestation, water conservancy, and military training. It is planned to recruit 500 to 1,000 people. After completing the training, they will be assigned to various counties to serve. Each person must be responsible for completing several tasks in a few months, or holding them in stages. Assuming each stage is one month, in the first three months, they must lead the villagers to organize the township office. In the second three months, they must organize the Baojia system in each township, or organize the cooperative. We will give him a specific job and ask him to complete it in stages. If we can have schools as the center, security teams to participate, and supplement rural construction workers, and assign them to each county and township in the province to help us work together, we may be able to achieve considerable results in the rural construction movement within three years and cultivate the foundation of the rural economy. If we can achieve results, the people will definitely be very happy and follow us in our efforts. If we continue like this, ten years later, the rural construction movement in Guangdong Province will definitely be able to show some achievements.

The problem I am raising today is indeed a very important and urgent one. Now that the funding is secured and the plan is about to be drafted, the current problem lies only in the people, that is, how to mobilize them. This problem is how to use people, how to train them, and how to organize them. Therefore, I am raising this problem today, and I am also providing my personal opinions for your reference. I hope that you will discuss it in detail and jointly formulate a plan so that the rural construction movement in Guangdong Province can achieve good results because of the promotion of capable personnel. (End)

### Messages from Lushan Amidst the Thorough Investigation of the Yarn Exchange Case

Yu Zhiqing said it should not be expanded, but there should be results. The staff sent by the Ministry of Industry to Shanghai to investigate have returned to Nanjing to report.

Kuling Dispatch

Central News Agency, Kuling, 10th: After the speculation wave in the Shanghai yarn market occurred, the government and society paid close attention to it. Shanghai business leaders Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, and Mu Ouchu were summoned to Lushan one after another. The reporter interviewed Mr. Mu and Mr. Yu separately. According to Mr. Yu, the current business situation in Shanghai is that it is not easy for businessmen to pay 100,000 or 80,000 in cash. The checks in this speculation wave are as high as hundreds of thousands or millions. Without great strength, how could this be achieved? In this time of national crisis, this type of situation should not be expanded, but the investigation should not be without results. According to Mr. Mu, the manipulators of this yarn wave are not the bulls but the bears. His personal position is related to the broker, and the broker is related to the client, so it is impossible to investigate clearly. After arriving in Lushan on the morning of the 10th, Yu Qiaqing was received by Chairman Chiang at 11:00, who inquired about the situation of the yarn exchange speculation wave. Mr. Yu reported in detail and asked for instructions on everything. He left the mountain at noon to Xunn, took a boat to return to Shanghai.

Shanghai News

The Ministry of Industry's thorough investigation of the Shanghai Yarn Exchange speculation wave was handled by Minister Wu himself, leading his staff to Shanghai. The case has now been submitted to the court for investigation. In addition to Minister Wu, who has already returned to Nanjing to report to President Chiang, Councilor Chen Yu and General Affairs Director Yan Shenyu, who came with him, also returned to Nanjing yesterday afternoon to report. Kuang Yunwen, the first section chief of the Department of Commerce, is scheduled to return to Nanjing today. According to Chief Kuang yesterday, he was ordered to come to Shanghai to investigate the yarn exchange speculation wave because of his relationship with the responsible section. The case has been transferred to the court for handling according to law. He personally did not want to make any external statements. However, today (10th) I read in the newspaper that Vice Minister Zou's conversation with Mu Ouchu included Mu's reply that "Chief Kuang stated in court that there was no evidence against Wu Shenglin." According to the investigation results of the Ministry, all have been transferred to the court one after another. During the first court hearing, I attended and prepared a written statement. I don't know what Chairman Mu is referring to.

Minister of Finance Zou Lin and Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang paid a visit to President Chiang on the 6th to report on the Shanghai Yarn Exchange speculation wave and ask for instructions on everything.

### Shanghai North Health Center Opened Yesterday

Mayor Yu's wife cut the ribbon. Hu Hongji's bronze statue unveiled.

The Shanghai North Health Center of the Municipal Health Bureau held its opening ceremony at its location on Qingyun Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. At the same time, the bronze statue of former Health Bureau Director Hu Hongji, which was built inside the center, was also unveiled. The ceremony was very grand. Details are as follows:

Opening Ceremony

The center held its opening ceremony yesterday. Acting Mayor Yu, Xu Fu, Shen Yi, and Wang Xiaolai from the Chamber of Commerce (represented by Cao Zhigong), Yan Fuqing from the Red Cross Society, Pang Jingzhou, Weng Zhilong, the director of the Municipal Hospital, Yang Dean from the New Life Movement, Xu Xiaochu from the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, and more than 100 other people were present. Director Li and Center Director You Jihua and all the staff welcomed them at the scene. The opening ceremony began with Mrs. Acting Mayor Yu cutting the ribbon, followed by the chairman's opening speech, Director Li's report on the internal organization, and the unveiling of former Director Hu's bronze statue, which was built on the first floor of the center. Acting Mayor Yu removed the national flag covering the statue, and everyone bowed to express their respect. Finally, Director Li led the guests on a tour of the center, and the ceremony ended.

Chairman's Speech

Chairman and Acting Mayor Yu delivered an opening speech, stating that the Municipal Health Bureau originally planned to establish health centers in 17 districts throughout the city in order to promote health work throughout the city. However, due to the high cost and the lack of funds in the city treasury, it had to adopt a gradual approach. The Gaogiao and Wusong districts were established in the 18th year, the Hongwan district was established in November of the 22nd year, the Shanghai South district was established in January of the 23rd year, and the Shanghai North district covers a vast area with a dense population, with the largest number of working-class people. After the Songhu war disaster, various municipal affairs urgently need construction in order to achieve recovery. Health facilities such as epidemic prevention and health care are particularly urgent. Therefore, despite the extreme financial difficulties, a committee was established to organize and plan the construction. After years of effort and assistance from all walks of life, it was finally realized. Today, we are holding the opening ceremony, and we are very honored to have the guidance from all walks of life. At the same time, Mr. Hu Hongji, the former director, made outstanding contributions to the Health Bureau. Therefore, a bronze statue was specially built in the office building today. The unveiling ceremony is also held today for people to admire and remember.

Li's Report

Director Li Tingan then reported that, although the construction of the Shanghai North Health Center is limited by funding, the scale is not very large, but the building structure and internal equipment were carefully planned by the Public Works Bureau and adopted the latest styles. This office began its work in November last year. Internally, it is divided into four sections: the first section is responsible for documents, accounting, general affairs, drug delivery management, and health education; the second section is responsible for cleaning, sanitation, general hygiene, and meat inspection; the third section is responsible for maternal and child health, school health, and labor health; and the fourth section is responsible for life statistics, epidemic prevention and treatment, and a clinic is attached. This is the general situation of the organization. I hope that all sectors of society will give our colleagues in the bureau guidance and encouragement at any time.

Public Bathhouse

The center also has a public bathhouse to meet the needs of the common people. According to the bathhouse rules, the opening hours are from 3:00 PM to 8:00 PM every day. The fee is extremely low, 4 cents for men and 8 cents for women. Towels are self-provided, so there is no risk of spreading various diseases. In addition, the number of patients diagnosed by the center has reached 300 to 400 per day recently, and the number of citizens contacting or requesting matters from the center is increasing every day, which shows that the public has paid close attention to the center.

### Qin Dechun Cables Shanghai Denying Reorganization of Hebei-Chahar Political Council

Reply to Li Guang'an, Representative of the 29th Army stationed in Shanghai

The Central News Agency reports that due to the fact that Song Zheyuan, member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, is currently recuperating in Leling, rumors have spread that the Hebei-Chahar Political Council will be reorganized. Li Guang'an, representative of the 29th Army stationed in Shanghai, specifically cabled Qin Dechun, Mayor of Beiping, on the 7th to inquire about the truth. A reply was received on the 9th, stating that it was purely a rumor. The original telegram stated: "To Brother Li Guang'an, Representative of the 29th Army in Shanghai, Your telegram of the [date] has been received. Regarding the rumors circulating about the reorganization of the Hebei-Chahar political situation, they are purely rumors and have no basis. I hereby reply by telegram.

### Wu Tiecheng Responds Favorably to Moving Monument Funds to Support Border Defense

Shanghai citizen Yan Esheng, along with former Mayors Zhang Dingfan, Zhang Qun, and Wu Tiecheng, requested that the Shanghai citizens abandon the proposal to build a Tang Yin monument and instead use the funds to save the nation. It is now reported that Wu Tiecheng has replied favorably. The original letter stated: "To Mr. Esheng, I arrived in Shanghai on the 4th, but due to the press of affairs and the diagnosis and treatment of dental ailments and a physical examination, I was occupied all day and unable to pay my respects immediately. I have now received your letter and am delighted to read its contents. I have been involved in Shanghai's municipal affairs for nearly six years and have accomplished little, and I feel remorseful. I previously heard that there were plans to raise funds to build a Tang Yin monument, but I strongly opposed it because I felt that I was unworthy. Later, I heard that it was changed to commemorate the four mayors, and I did not want to interfere in a matter that did not concern me. I now think of a better plan, which is to inject funds into border defense, to seek peace of mind for all. This is what I deeply desire. In addition to forwarding your views to the relevant parties and requesting that they be adopted immediately, I am also conveying my thoughts. I wish you peace. Wu Tiecheng, respectfully, July 9th."

### Representatives of Borderland Chieftains of Southwestern Ethnic Minorities Issue Declaration on Petition

Hoping for Sincere Unity to Defend the Border, Letter Sent to Petitioning Chieftains to Inquire About the Original Intention

The Central News Agency reports that Gao Yuzhu, representative of the borderland chieftains of southwestern ethnic minorities, and Yu Jiecai, representative of the petitioning people, have been petitioning in Beijing since last year. The result has been very satisfactory after a year. They were originally planning to pack their bags and return to the south within days. However, suddenly there were nine people, including Li Zongbo, representative of the Lijiang Muli Tusi in Yunnan, stationed in Yunnan, who telegraphed the Central Government, denying that the petitioning event had occurred. The representatives believe that this matter concerns their personal reputation and has a significant impact on the happiness of the Yi and Miao people and the future of unity among all ethnic groups in the entire country. In order to prevent the outside world from misunderstanding the truth, in addition to specifically presenting the process to the Central Government and requesting punishment for the troublemakers, they also issued a declaration. The following is a special excerpt:

Respectfully submitted, It has been reported that nine people, including Li Zongbo, representative of the Lijiang Muli Tusi in Yunnan, stationed in Yunnan, are jealous of the representatives' successful petition in Beijing and the sympathy and attention of the Chinese people. They are even unwilling to consider the overall situation and are being exploited by others to falsely telegraph the Central Government, clarifying their denial, intending to provoke discord and with sinister motives, which is extremely sad. Our Central Government cherishes the suffering of the Yi and Miao people in the southwestern borderland and will surely discern the truth and handle this perverse behavior, regardless of the distance. The representatives need not discuss this matter. However, considering the tens of millions of Yi and Miao people in the southwestern borderland, located in the border areas of Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Xikang provinces, where transportation is blocked, culture is backward, the government's reach is limited, and the Chinese people regard them as uncivilized, they are suffering from foreign aggression to the extreme. The representatives, standing as borderland Yi Tusi, have made righteous appeals and have spared no effort in running around for years to rescue them. The year before last, Chairman Jiang visited the southwest, and the Yi and Miao people deeply felt his kindness. The Tusi from various borderland areas were inspired by this and became more eager for governance. Therefore, they sent representatives to Beijing to petition, sincerely supporting the Central Government, requesting support for development, improving culture, and improving living conditions, hoping to unite sincerely with all ethnic groups in the country, defend the border, and revitalize the national ethnicity. The purpose is upright and the actions are open and aboveboard. From beginning to end, they have not borrowed the name of any agency, organization, or any local official, nor have they been directed or funded by any party. As evidenced by the petition documents signed and sealed by the Tusi from various borderland areas when the representatives first arrived in Beijing, it is clear that Pillar's family has received national favor for generations, succeeding as the Beisheng Tusi. Her late father, while alive, represented the 21 Tusi along the border, seeking the welfare of the border people. Wang Zhu inherited her father's ambition and did not feel discouraged because she was a weak woman. She dared not lag behind in going to justice. This time, she risked dangers to plead for the people. The sacrifice for the nation is the way to repay the country. Looking back on the past year, everything she has stated is from the perspective of the entire southwestern borderland issue, seeking the welfare of all the Yi and Miao people, and there is absolutely no selfishness. The Central Government has been planning and managing the southwestern borderland Yi and Miao issue as a whole, and there is no need for a general representative in name. If it is considered that the representatives came to Beijing to petition without the approval of the Yunnan Provincial Government, which is illegal, then the petitioning Tusi who signed and sealed the documents this time are from Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Xikang provinces, so it is impossible to submit them to the record one by one. There are differences in interests, and it is difficult to reach a consensus of opinions, which may cause obstacles and delay the opportunity. Moreover, the people of a democratic country have the right to express their opinions on national affairs as long as they do not intend to deprive public power, and freedom of speech cannot be restricted by anyone. The representatives were born as border people, stated border affairs, and the Central Government had the right to adopt and review them. The upper order was followed and each had their own responsibilities. What is the point of arguing about being responsible or irresponsible? Now that the petition has ended, the Central Government is planning and managing the southwestern borderland Yi and Miao issue. Many Chinese people have a deep understanding of this issue and are enthusiastically developing it. The representatives have been ordered to return to the south and will follow the policy shown by the Central Government and do their best to handle the propaganda, investigation, and educational work. All Yi and Miao people should strive to improve themselves, eliminate the past bad habits of self-seclusion, and strive to move forward. However, Li Zongbo and others are trying to satisfy their own selfish desires and deliberately obstructing and sabotaging, which is to attack the representatives, that is, to oppose the Central Government's intentions and prevent the development of the Chinese people. The representatives are fighting for the borderland Yi and Miao people, and they do not care about their personal gains or losses, but the impact on the overall situation and the future happiness of the Yi and Miao people is a source of infinite grief. Li Zongbo and others have different opinions on this petition, so why didn't they make a statement when the Central Government initially sent the full text of the petition to the relevant provincial governments for review? Even if it is said that the names of these people are not listed in the petition, it is known that the area of Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Xikang is vast, there are many Tusi, and the situation is complicated, so it is difficult to sign and seal one by one, which is not allowed by the facts. However, if the petitioning opinions are correct, signing or not cannot be required to be perfect. Moreover, during the period when the representatives petitioned in Beijing, they submitted the petitioning situation to the Party Departments of Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Xikang, and Hunan provinces for review, and were instructed to review and approve them by the governments of Guizhou, Hunan, and Sichuan provinces. There are no omissions in the procedures. If there is anything untrue or incomplete, it should be remedied at that time. Now that things have passed, there is nothing to criticize. Suddenly there is this regressive and absurd telegram, which is nothing less than deliberately showing weakness and giving people an opportunity to take advantage of it. Also, the Tusi listed in the telegram are half relatives and friends of the representatives, and their interests are consistent. It is impossible to have this unconscious and presumptuous behavior. It is inevitable that Li Zongbo and others are falsely accusing. It has been verified that Li Zongbo claims to be a representative of the Muli Tusi, but Muli is under the jurisdiction of the Sichuan Provincial Government. Why is he stationed in Kunming instead of Chengdu? The Muli Tusi also sent representatives to Beijing to petition, and the representatives also provided a lot of assistance to them. It is also known that Li Zongbo is listed among the nine people in the telegram. Even if it is assumed to be true, can these few people represent all the Tusi in Yunnan and deny the petitioning actions of the representatives over the past year, or are all the Tusi Yi and Miao in the southwest completely unwilling to accept this petition and oppose the Central Government's intentions? All of these require the Central Government to thoroughly investigate. In short, the words and deeds of the representatives over the years have been understood by all parties, and the right and wrong of public opinion are in the hearts of the people. It cannot be far-fetched. The representatives have made efforts and do not seek merit, but only seek no faults. If the Central Government considers the representatives' petition to be illegal and guilty, please issue a strict order for punishment to warn the representatives. Otherwise, the Central Government should thoroughly investigate the crimes of Li Zongbo and others. It is the good fortune of the southwestern borderland Yi and Miao, and the future of the country depends on it. In addition to separately telegraphing the Central Government and the authorities of the southwestern provinces to request strict inspection and handling to show fairness, and to sending letters to the petitioning Tusi to inquire about the original intention and make corrections on their own, we pray for your understanding and are extremely grateful. This declaration is hereby made. Southwestern Yi and Miao Borderland Tusi Representative Gao Yuzhu, Southwestern Ethnic Minorities Petitioning People's Representative Yu Jiecai, July 8.

### Various Circles' Meeting to Purchase Aircraft for Birthday Celebration to Hold Final Meeting Today

Meeting to Be Held at the YMCA at 4 PM

On October 30th of last year, celebrating Commander-in-Chief Jiang's 50th birthday, various agencies, organizations, and schools in this city, considering that General Jiang has carried on the work of the Premier and has devoted himself to the revolution over the years, creating the Party and the nation, and that his great achievements have benefited all the people, specially initiated the organization of Shanghai's various circles to raise funds to purchase aircraft and present them to the government as a memorial to Commander-in-Chief Jiang's 50th birthday.

### Silk Factory Labor Dispute in Xinzha District to be Mediated Again Tomorrow

Workers Still on Strike Yesterday

All workers from 14 silk factories including Fuchang in the Changan Road area of Xinzha District, declared a joint strike on the 2nd of this month to demand a pay raise, which has not yet been resolved for many days. The Bureau of Social Affairs previously mediated and advised both parties to try to reach an amicable settlement outside the government within three days. However, because the workers demanded a pay raise of ten cents per worker, while the employers only agreed to a pay raise of two cents per worker, there was still no result. Currently, the workers of the 14 silk factories are continuing their strike, but the factories are also unwilling to resume operations immediately due to a shortage of raw materials. It is understood that the Bureau of Social Affairs, in order to quickly resolve this dispute, has now scheduled to convene both parties again at 1:00 PM tomorrow (Monday) to continue mediation, in order to avoid prolonged disputes.

### Workers Request Continued Mediation in Sino-Foreign Labor Dispute

Opinions of Both Parties Still Difficult to Reconcile

All workers of the Nanshi China Merchants Electric Company raised a dispute over the request to amend service regulations and improve treatment, which has been deadlocked for a long time.

The workers are worried that if this continues to be delayed, labor unrest will inevitably occur, so they specifically requested the Municipal Party Committee member Lu Jingshi to act as mediator. It is now learned that after Lu discussed the dispute with the company's manager Lu Bohong, the company refused to increase workers' salaries but agreed to subsidize those with a salary below 40 yuan with 3 yuan, those with a salary below 60 yuan with 2 yuan, and those above 60 yuan with 1 yuan. However, the workers believe that the company is not sincere in negotiating, expressed indignation, specifically held a meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures, and requested Lu Jingshi to continue mediating in order to avoid labor unrest.

### Launch of Movement to Abolish Concession Film Censorship to be Held This Afternoon

Extremely Enthusiastic Participation of Cultural Groups. A Declaration Will Be Issued to Make a Solemn Statement.

The Shanghai cultural community's movement to abolish the film and opera censorship rights of the concessions is scheduled to hold an inaugural meeting at 3:00 PM today (the 11th) at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce near Tianhou Palace Bridge. A declaration will be issued to solemnly state the illegality of the concession's censorship rights and to draw the attention of the Chinese people. The General Association of Electric Education will send personnel to Shanghai to guide and promote the movement. Details are as follows:

Enthusiastic Participation of Cultural Groups

The cultural community of this city, in view of the concession authorities' arbitrary destruction of our national film scripts and songs under the guise of censorship, especially the films and operas with national defense awareness and national salvation produced by various film companies, playwrights and composers recently, have been unreasonably censored and banned from performance. Even those that have been approved by the central government have also been banned from public performances in the concession. Therefore, the movement to abolish the film and opera censorship rights of the concessions was launched to safeguard sovereignty and save cultural life. The cultural groups that have officially participated in the movement include the Shanghai branch of the China Film Education Association, the Shanghai Film Production Industry Association, the Newspaper Association Drama Writers Association, the Song Writers Association, the China Literature and Art Association, the Shanghai Journalists Association, the PEN Club, the Theater Troupe Friendship Association, the Book Industry Association, the Shanghai Interview Journalists Friendship Association, the Poets Association Broadcasting Industry Association and other twenty-four units, which is extremely enthusiastic.

Inaugural Meeting to be Held Today

After the launch of the movement, the participating groups elected the Film Production Industry Association, the Theater Troupe Friendship Association, the China Literature and Art Association, the Drama Writers Association and the Song Writers Association to form a preparatory committee to actively carry out the preparations. Now the draft organization charter has been formulated by the preparatory committee, and everything is ready. The inaugural meeting will be held at 3:00 PM today (the 11th) in the auditorium of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce near Tianhou Palace Bridge. In addition to passing the charter and electing officers, a declaration will also be issued to express a solemn statement on the unreasonableness of the current film and opera censorship system in the concession, with the aim of promoting the sympathy of international public opinion and the attention of the Chinese people, and discussing practical methods for abolishing the censorship. The General Association of China Film Education Association has specially sent representative Lu Juewu to Shanghai to guide everything.

### Jin Su, Who Stabbed Yan Duhe, Appeal Rejected

The original judgment sentenced Jin to six months in prison and two years of guardianship.

Jin Su, a clerk of the Jiangsu High Court branch and a native of Suzhou, has in recent years experienced an inexplicable illness that he believed was caused by Yan Duhe, deputy editor-in-chief of the Xinwen Bao, who used a type of evil magic that humans cannot resist. Consequently, he has repeatedly harassed Yan. Despite explanations, he remained deluded. On April 25 of this year, at 1:00 PM, Jin prepared a file knife and waited at the entrance of the Xinwen Bao. When Yan arrived at the office, Jin stepped forward and stabbed Yan in the neck. Jin was immediately arrested and sent to the First Special District Court, which sentenced Jin to six months in prison and two years of guardianship. Jin appealed to the First Branch of the High Court, which has also concluded the hearing. The details have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning was the day for sentencing. Mr. Gan Jingxian, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, was also present in court. Judge Shan Yuhua, accompanied by Judges Peng and Xiao, ascended to the Criminal Court No. 1 and announced the verdict: the appeal was rejected.

### Taxpayers' Association Committee Requests Protest Against the PWD's Oppression

Interfering with the Opening of Anti-Smuggling Slogans, Arbitrary Arrests of Youths Singing National Salvation Songs

Yu Yaoqiu, executive member of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession, sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association yesterday, requesting that a representative assembly of taxpayers be convened as soon as possible to protest against the PWD's illegal interference with the showing of anti-smuggling slogans in various cinemas and the arrest of youths singing national salvation songs. The letter stated: "To the esteemed Association, it has been found that on the 27th of last month, the Shanghai Anti-Smuggling Movement Committee, saddened by the rampant smuggling that encroaches on the entire Chinese market and causes great harm to legitimate commerce both domestically and internationally, held a propaganda rally to awaken the Chinese people to unite in stopping smuggling. The committee also sent letters to various cinemas asking them to show propaganda slogans to promote public awareness. However, the Public Works Department of the Public Concession sent personnel to prevent and interfere, which is outrageous. Furthermore, on the evening of the 9th of this month, some young students sang national salvation songs in the Bund Park, which is a common pastime on summer nights. However, the police arrested and arbitrarily beat them, abusing their power. All of these actions disrespect our national rights and dignity to the extreme. If this continues, what can we expect? I, Yaoqiu, have silently observed the past and considered the future, and I feel deeply concerned and cannot remain silent. I believe that your esteemed association is a special organization to protect the legal interests of the Chinese people in the concession. Therefore, I respectfully request that you speak out for justice to uphold national dignity and satisfy public expectations."

### Seven Suspects in Ningbo-Shandong Gang Fight Sent to Court Yesterday for Interrogation

Caused by a Bicycle Race, Identity of Murderer to be Investigated

At the entrance of Heng Deli, Meizhou Road, Yangshupu, at 7:40 PM the day before yesterday, gangs from Ningbo and Shandong, over a minor matter, gathered hundreds of thugs each to engage in a large-scale brawl. As a result, Chinese plainclothes detective Zha Haikun, No. 1895, age 30, native of Suqian, was fatally stabbed, and Chinese detective No. 2944 was also injured.

Chinese detective No. 2944 and Chen Zhilin, Shen Zhaojin, Zhou Xiaoqing, and Du Changtai all sustained serious injuries and were sent to the hospital for treatment. The deceased, Zha Haikun, was taken to the forensic examination facility on Feilun Road to await examination. Qiu Jiuxing, Qin Libang, and seven others were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that the cause of the incident was that the defendant Qin Libang (age 17) and Qiu Amao (age 19) from Ningbo were racing bicycles on the road on the 7th of this month. Qin won due to his superior skill, causing Yin to become enraged and start an argument. Yin beat Qin and dispersed. At that time, an old Ningbo man saw two people beating one and said that it was not honorable, and Du Changtai (the fifth defendant) from the Shandong gang also intervened, causing another argument. Both sides then gathered hundreds of people each for a brawl. The deceased, plainclothes detective, Zha Haikun, lived at No. 19 Heng Deli. Hearing the noise, he went outside to call the police at the police亭, was regarded as an accomplice, and was fatally stabbed. The identity of the murderer has not yet been determined and requested an extension. Judge Xiao Xiefen questioned the defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody for a further hearing in seven days.

Ms. Wang Chen then handed over one yuan, asking him to bring charcoal. The first time the ship arrived in Shanghai, Ms. Wang Chen and her fifteen-year-old sister-in-law, Wang Xiaoxia, went to the port together to pick up the charcoal. Cao had not yet handled it. The second time the ship arrived, Ms. Wang Chen suddenly fell ill. At about 4:00 PM on the tenth of last month, she ordered Wang Xiaoxia to collect it alone. Cao, being a lascivious person, saw the young sister's delicate and charming appearance, and lust arose. He lured Xiaoxia to Room 20 and forcibly raped her. It was not until about 10:00 PM that afternoon that he released Xiaoxia. Xiaoxia, knowing shame, was unhappy because of the matter of reputation, crying every day, which caused her to be mentally exhausted. Her sister-in-law saw that the situation was very different and asked her, but she refused to tell the truth. On the 14th, Wang Xiaoxia felt pain and discomfort in her lower body, and had to tell Wang Chen about the disease. She was sent to the Xiaodongmen Hospital for treatment.

### Father and Son Robbing in Cooperation by Flashing Money

Under the Pretense of Police Officer Raiding Smuggled Goods, Fortunately Discovered and Arrested by Chinese Police

Zhu Shuoshou from Qingtian, Zhejiang, 25 years old, has been engaged in commerce in Qingtian. Recently, he planned to go to France to do business. He came to Shanghai a few days ago and stayed at the Yong'an Hotel on Tianzhutang Street in the French Concession. He entrusted 450 yuan in cash to the French Post Ship Company on Aiduya Road Huangpu Bund to apply for a passport and purchase a ship ticket for his departure to France, but because the passport could not be obtained, Zhu went to the French Post Ship Company at 7:00 AM on the 9th to collect the 450 yuan he had paid. Unexpectedly, the money was exposed, and the bandits Wang Zhongcheng (21 years old) and Wang Zhong (41 years old) from Wenzhou, father and son, who lived at No. 36 Lujia宅, Xiaodongmen, and two accomplices saw it, followed him to Tianzhutang Street, and Wang Zhongcheng posed as a police officer and threatened Zhu, saying that the paper bag he was carrying contained smuggled goods or red pills of opium, and wanted to forcibly rob him. Detective Ji Chengxi and Chinese policeman No. 192 saw them and arrested Wang and his son. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Special District Court, and Judge Liao Jian interrogated them in Criminal Court No. 1. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the case and requested an extension of the investigation.

He learned that his son was arrested and went to the police station to inquire. The plaintiff accused me of being there, which is a false accusation. In court, the judge reviewed the confession, ordered a rehearing at 9:00 AM on the 17th, ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody, and refused the request for bail.

### Husband Dies of Illness, Two Women Contend for Estate, Leading to Lawsuit

Fan Li Sues Fan Zhao and Xing Zhigang for Embezzlement

Fan Li, a rural woman from the Fengjiazhai area of Shanghai County, along with Fan Qiaosheng, her husband's adopted son, filed a private prosecution in the local court against Fan Zhao, another woman of her deceased husband, and Xing Zhigang, the district chief of the Fifth District, for embezzlement. Yesterday, Judge Lu Hongze of the Shanghai District Court held a hearing. The plaintiff, Fan Li, did not appear. Fan Qiaosheng, the adopted son, testified that he was 37 years old, a native of Shanghai, and worked in the dry goods business. He was suing Xing Zhigang and Fan Zhao over family matters. His deceased adoptive father, Fan Shuntang, passed away on February 15th of last year. After his adoptive father's death, the defendant, Fan Zhao, and the family disputed the land deeds. As a result, the land deeds were entrusted to the township office for safekeeping. There were over 40 mu (a Chinese unit of measurement for land) in total, as well as three Shanghai County land deeds, three Nanhui County land deeds, and one split deed, roughly equivalent to another 20 mu. The exact amount was difficult to ascertain for the time being. Fan Zhao refused to hand them over, and Fan Zhao has three children. All the rent collected has been taken by Fan Zhao, which can be attested to by family elders. This year, Fan Zhao entrusted District Chief Xing to report to the public security bureau, claiming that over ten mu of land deeds held by the township office were lost and replaced. All the evidence was fabricated by Xing Zhigang alone. They jointly embezzled the property, and therefore, he requested investigation and prosecution. Fan Zhao testified that she was 33 years old, a native of Shanghai. Fan Shuntang was her husband, and she was his second wife, not a concubine. The plaintiff, Fan Li, was merely her husband's paramour. As for the family meeting, she and her children were not present and did not sign anything. The land deeds were all taken by them. She had none. Because they refused to return them after the robbery, she made a public statement in the newspaper that they were lost. Fan Qiaosheng is a nephew, not an adopted son. Her husband left a total of over 40 mu of land, not over 60 mu. When the robbery occurred, there were also contracts, jewelry, passbooks, and other items. Xing Zhigang, 48 years old, a native of Shanghai and the district chief of the Fifth District of Chenxing Town in Pudong, testified that Fan Zhao entrusted him to publish a statement in the newspaper declaring the land deeds lost. He asked the township head of Duzhi Township, Xi Musheng, to sign a guarantee, but he refused, so the matter was halted. In fact, on the 13th day of the second lunar month of the 25th year of the Republic [1936], Fan Shuntang became seriously ill. He called Fan Qiaosheng, who did not come. On the 15th, Shuntang passed away and was prepared for burial. Because Fan Qiaosheng wanted to grab the deceased's head, Fan Zhao refused. They went to his office in the district public office to mediate. Afterwards, Fan Qiaosheng tricked Fan Zhao into going to the public office. Fan Qiaosheng and others went to Fan Zhao's house, broke the lock, and went inside to rob land deeds, passbooks, etc. Lawyer Pan Zhensheng was retained to defend him. The court ordered that the hearing be adjourned for another day.

### Xu Xiuying Sues Yang Shouqing for Abandonment

Xu Xiuying, a 28-year-old woman from Chuansha, met Yang Shouqing, also known as Yang Xiuqing, a wealthy man from No. 6, Liuzaowan, Yongdong (49 years old this year), four years ago. Enticed by Yang's sweet words and promise of marriage, Xu Xiuying did not let Yang's age diminish her love. After cohabitating, she gave birth to a daughter in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], who died on September 29th of last year. However, on March 4th of last year, she gave birth to another son, named Xuanxin. Recently, their love fractured. Yang not only neglects their livelihood but has disappeared completely. Xu Xiuying and her son reside at No. 50, Ruilefang, Lanwei Ai Road. Helpless as they are due to their dire financial straits, Yang Xuanxin, as the biological son, with Xu Xiuying as the legal guardian, sued Yang Shouqing for abandonment in the local court. Yesterday, a summons was issued, but the defendant refused to accept it. The court ordered the plaintiff to serve the summons.

### Mrs. Shatoff, Suspected of Being a Communist, Voluntarily Leaves Shanghai to Return to Russia

Promises to Depart as Soon as Recovered from Illness; City Police Bureau Advisor Does Not Object

Mrs. Shatoff, a 34-year-old Russian woman, was arrested by the City Police Bureau, together with the Public Concession Police, on the afternoon of the 29th of last month on North Suzhou Road due to suspicion of being a Communist. Subsequently, many anti-government books were seized at the International Bookstore Company at No. 841 Jing'an Temple Road. She was sent to the High Court Second Branch for interrogation and ordered to pay a 300-yuan bail and await further questioning outside of jail. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Yu Huating, accompanied by Judges Peng and Xiao, ascended the bench for the hearing. The Shanghai City Police Bureau was represented by legal advisor Lawyer Zhan Jifeng. Mrs. Shatoff did not appear and delegated American lawyer Olmen to appear in court. He stated that the day Mrs. Shatoff was arrested was also the day her husband passed away. As a result, she was deeply traumatized and suddenly developed a lung disease. According to the doctor, she needs six weeks to recover. However, Mrs. Shatoff has expressed that she is willing to leave Shanghai and return to her country as soon as she recovers from her illness and can provide written proof. The court immediately asked Zhan Jifeng, the advisor to the City Police Bureau, for his opinion on the defendant lawyer's request. Advisor Zhan stated that if the defendant could provide a pledge to leave China and return to Russia as soon as she recovered from her illness, then the bureau would not object to the defendant's request. The Public Concession lawyer Gan Jingxian also had no objections to this proposal. Judge Yu then ordered Mrs. Shatoff to submit a written statement of her recovery and return to her country within three days, after which she would be allowed to reclaim her bail. The seized books will be sent to the City Party Headquarters for review and further handling.

### Two of the Three Defendants Have the Same Name and Surname

The Results of the Trial Showed That They Were Not the Actual Perpetrators

During the Shanghai war in the 21st year of the Republic [1932], Ji Zhongtang, a detective who had been dismissed, was shot and killed in the Xiangyan Bridge area of Hongkou due to a dispute over gambling rights. At the time, the widow of the deceased, Ji Wu, accused the murderers of being Wang Shubao, Zheng Xiaoheizi, and Wang Sanshizi. Ji's apprentice, Zhang Xiaowanzi, testified. The case was delayed until last year, when the local court arrested Wang Shubao, the owner of the Xiangwu Stage, and sentenced him to 13 years in prison. Upon appeal, Zhang Xiaowanzi testified that the murderer was another Wang Shubao with a pockmarked face. As a result, the original sentence was revoked and he was declared innocent. Recently, Wang Sanshizi was arrested again. After investigation by the local court, and upon learning of this, Ji filed a complaint seeking prosecution. The prosecutor then filed a public prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zongxing held a hearing. Wang Sanshizi claimed that he was named Sanshizi because his father was 30 years old when he was born. He did not kill Ji Zhongtang. The Wang Sanshizi accused was another person with the same name and surname. When the official questioned Zhang Xiaowanzi, he also stated, as in the previous case, that there was another Wang Sanshizi, and not the Wang Sanshizi in the case. The official considered that in one case, there were actually two defendants with the same name, which was a peculiar fact. The case should be handled pending a ruling.

### Major Bandit Gang Murder Case Reopened for Debate Yesterday

Sentencing Set for the Morning of the 16th

Zhang Ganqing, a major bandit from Hefei, Anhui, colluded with accomplices on the afternoon of December 1st of last year to rob a woman's handbag on Route Lafayette in the French Concession. He opened fire and resisted arrest, killing a Russian, Li Yaming George (transliteration), before fleeing. On March 17th of this year, he again robbed the Dacheng Money Exchange in Zhenjiang, obtaining mostly auxiliary currency coupons, and fled to Shanghai with the loot. He was arrested by the French Concession Police. His accomplices, Wang Fuan and Zhang Guangcai, were also apprehended. It was also discovered that an accomplice, Yu Deshi, had been arrested in Hefei. Detectives were sent to transfer him to Shanghai. Two box cannons and dozens of bullets found in Zhang Guangcai's home were also brought to the Special Second Court for interrogation and detention. The Shanghai City Police Bureau and the Zhenjiang Police Department successively sent detectives to the Special Second Court to request the transfer of the bandits for interrogation. This has been reported in previous newspapers. This case was originally concluded by Liao Jun, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, after repeatedly holding court hearings and examining witnesses. A date was set for sentencing. However, because there were still unclear aspects of the case, the conclusion of the debate was revoked. At 11:00 am yesterday, Presiding Judge Liao attended the Criminal Court No. 1 and ordered the defendants to be brought to court for a reopening of the debate and hearing. The French Concession Police Department was represented by Lawyer Fei Xizhen, who prosecuted Zhang Ganqing for attempted robbery and murder, Wang Fuan for robbery and murder, Zhang Guangcai for illegal possession of firearms, and Yu Debu for robbery, citing relevant provisions of the criminal law. The court appointed lawyers Jin Xiongbo and Zhu Dianqing to defend the defendants. After the court questioned the defendants in detail, it ordered the debate to begin. First, Prosecutor Wang Ren presented his opinions, followed by mutual debate between the police department and the defendants' defense lawyers. The court announced the conclusion of the debate and set the sentencing for 9:00 am on the 16th. The defendants were returned to the detention center. After the verdict in this case, because the defendants also committed robbery cases in the Chinese-controlled area of the city, the Shanghai City Police Bureau will first transfer them for interrogation. After the interrogation is concluded, the Zhenjiang Police Department will transfer the defendants back to Zhenjiang.

### Ningbo Native Association Sends Letter to He Dekui to Plead for Vendors

Stall Vendors on Yuanfang Road Cannot Afford the Heavy Donation; Please Show Consideration and Maintain the Original Status

Datong News Agency reports that the Ningbo and Fenghua Native Associations in Shanghai sent a letter to He Dekui, the Deputy General Manager of the Public Works Department, yesterday, stating: "We are writing to you because we received a letter from more than 80 people from the Fenghua Native Association, including Ru Qing, stating that they make a living by setting up stalls selling vegetables, fish, and meat along Yuanfang Road and Old Street in Shanghai. They have been paying a donation of two yuan per stall per month for many years. Recently, the Public Works Department decided to change the donation method starting on July 1st of this year, with each stall paying nine national currency units per quarter, paid in one lump sum, which is an increase of one yuan per month compared to the previous donation. These fellow villagers are all small-scale businesses, with each stall having a capital of six or seven yuan at most, and only two or three yuan at the least. They rely on meager profits to support their entire families. The increased donation is already an unbearable burden, and paying in one lump sum is even more difficult. They entrusted us to find a way to help them. On the 26th of last month, our Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai forwarded the request to the Public Works Department, hoping that the Public Works Department would consider the actual difficulties of these vendors and allow them to maintain the original status quo. We have not received a reply yet. Suddenly, the police in charge sent personnel to collect donations from each vendor, collecting two yuan per month according to the original donation. The vendors were overjoyed, thinking that the Public Works Department had approved the request and maintained the original status quo. Unexpectedly, the next day, the donation office sent personnel to collect a donation fee of nine yuan per stall per quarter from the vendors, and pointed out that the previously issued permits were illegal, causing panic among the crowd. Subsequently, they recovered the two-yuan permits from each stall and ordered them to collect the nine-yuan-per-quarter permits. The vendors felt that the matter was ambiguous. If they paid according to the new regulations, they would be unable to bear the heavy burden. However, the donation officers used force to collect the donations as coercion. The vendors recently came to the association again to request relief. Our association believes that the matter pertains to the legal rights and interests of our fellow villagers. In addition to instructing the vendors to wait patiently for a solution, we specially dispatched Chen Zhonggao and Dong Xinqin to accompany the representatives publicly elected by the vendors to present their difficulties. We sincerely hope that you will grant us an audience. We are writing to you for this purpose, hoping you will investigate and handle the matter accordingly."
