[Xuzhou] Zhang and Yang's troops have been retreating from the front lines for days. There is no trace of Zhang's troops between Chishui and Weinan. The Central Army advanced sequentially on the 3rd and reached Weinan on the morning of the 4th.

[Luoyang] According to Zhu Shaozhou, Commander of the Gongluo Garrison, Zhang's troops on both the north and south banks of the Wei River have now retreated, and our troops have now advanced into Weinan. A small number of radical elements in Zhang's troops in Xi'an harmed senior generals, and the authorities have suppressed them and restored calm. The local populace hopes that the Central Army will arrive in Shaanxi soon, so that they can live and work in peace (Central News Agency dispatch on the 4th).

[Zhengzhou] Yang Hucheng ordered the front-line troops on the 4th to stand by at their original defenses. He will convene a meeting of generals above the division level in Xi'an on the 5th to discuss whether to withdraw troops (Special dispatch on the 4th).

[Luoyang] It is reported that the Xi'an mutiny has been suppressed by Yang Hucheng, Yu Xuezhong, and others by force, and it has now been quelled. In addition to Wang Yizhe, the army commander of Zhang's forces, those killed by the rioting elements reportedly include Jiang Bin, the former chief of the communications section of the Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters, and Song Xueli, the deputy adjutant of the 67th Army, and others. It is also rumored that Bao Wenxue and several senior generals of Zhang's forces escaped from Xi'an city during the rebellion (Central News Agency dispatch on the 4th).

[Nanjing] Sun Mingjiu, the commander of Zhang Xueliang's guard regiment, and others, after shooting and killing Wang Yizhe in the Xi'an mutiny, Tan Zixin and Shen Ke, the division commanders of Zhang's forces, surrendered to the Central Government.

[Nanjing] Sun Mingjiu, the commander of Zhang Xueliang's guard regiment, and many others opposed Yang Hucheng, Wang Yizhe, He Zhuguo, Yu Xuezhong, and others accepting orders from the Central Government.

It is reported that part of the rioting troops have withdrawn from Xi'an city and appear to be fleeing towards Sanyuan and Pucheng. It is generally believed that most of Zhang and Yang's troops have obeyed orders to withdraw. The rebellion by a portion of the troops in Xi'an city is a matter of their own internal divisions and is not directly related to the Central Government's overall handling of the aftermath in Shaanxi. Furthermore, the rebellion of these troops has strengthened the determination of powerful elements under Zhang and Yang to pledge allegiance to the Central Government (Special dispatch on the 4th).

[Nanjing] After Wang Yizhe was shot and killed by radical elements in Xi'an, Wang's wife sent a telegram to Minister He and Wang's friends in Beijing to report the news.

At the moment, police and guards are everywhere on the streets and alleys in the city. Large numbers of troops are gathered in the inner and outer city. All businesses are closed, and there is great panic (Central News Agency telegram on the 4th).

[Jinan] Han Fuju said that he received a telegram from Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong yesterday. I replied to the telegram and forwarded the original telegram to Chairman Chiang and Minister He without adding any comments (Special dispatch on the 4th).

[Nanjing] According to a certain news agency, when the radical elements of Zhang's forces in Xi'an rioted on the afternoon of the 2nd, they originally planned to overthrow Yang Hucheng, Yu Xuezhong, He Zhuguo, Miao Chengliu, Liu Duoqian, and others all at once. However, because there were not many elements who sympathized with this move, after Wang Yizhe was shot and killed, it angered the entire force, and they rose up together to surround and disarm the rebel troops. However, the right to defend the city gates was in the hands of the radical elements, and some were free to leave the city. Traffic between Xi'an and Xianyang was once cut off, but it has returned to normal on the 4th. The prosperous streets in the city were looted, and the people suffered great losses. Yang Hucheng and He Zhuguo have telegraphed their troops on the north bank of the Wei River to quickly retreat to Xi'an to maintain order. The Zhang and Yang troops along the Longhai Railway have already yielded ground. Gu Zhutong will send troops to Xi'an to assist in handling the aftermath. The Chishui and Bahe bridges will have temporary bridges erected by the Longhai Engineering Vehicles on the 4th, allowing people and horses to cross (Special dispatch on the 4th).

[Zhengzhou] The Longhai Railway engineering personnel repaired bridge works and tracks near Chishui on the 4th.

Tongguan: According to reliable information obtained by reporters from relevant parties regarding the situation of the mutiny in Xi'an City, after the senior generals in Xi'an expressed repentance and willingness to obey orders, an order to withdraw troops was issued a few days ago. This was opposed by Sun Mingjiu, Ying Detian, Miao Jianqiu, and other mutinous elements, heads of special service, artillery, and engineering regiments. They immediately visited Yu Xuezhong, Wang Yizhe, He Zhuguo, and others, demanding the revocation of the previous order and continuing resistance to the end. Wang Yizhe sternly rebuked Sun Mingjiu, saying, "Can your one regiment rebel?" Sun held a deep grudge. Having failed to get what they wanted, they incited the troops to riot, and gunshots rang out, never ceasing through the night. Wang Yizhe, Xu Fang, Jiang Bin, Song Xueli, and others were killed by the mutinous soldiers. Yu Xuezhong and He Zhuguo were spared in Yang Hucheng's residence. Sun, Ying, and Miao are now on the run.

Current Commentary

### The Development of the German Colonial Question

]
— Li

The clamor for Germany to reclaim its colonies has recently risen again. On the 30th of last month, Hitler solemnly raised this wish in his speech at the fourth anniversary celebration of the National Socialist Party's rule in Berlin. Recently, the German Ambassador to Britain, Ribbentrop, also brought instructions from Germany to Britain, preparing to conduct negotiations on the recovery of the colonies. In the near future, this issue may have a serious impact on the world.

The so-called former German colonies refer to the colonies Germany possessed in Asia and Africa before the war. They totaled more than two million square kilometers in area, with a population of more than ten million. These places are now mandated by the League of Nations to be ruled by countries such as Britain, France, Belgium, and Japan. Those ruled by Britain include the western part of Togoland, the northwestern part of Cameroon, Tanganyika, New Guinea, the Samoa Islands, Nauru Island, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Admiralty Islands. The area is approximately two million square kilometers, with a population of six million. Those ruled by France include the eastern part of Togoland and the southeastern part of Cameroon. The area is less than 500,000 square kilometers, with a population of 3.1 million. Those ruled by Belgium include Ruanda and Urundi, with an area of 45,000 square kilometers and a population of 2.5 million. Those ruled by Japan include the Caroline Islands, the Mariana Islands, and the Palau Islands, with an area of 5,000 square kilometers and a population of 50,000. Judging from these figures, the area of the former German colonies ruled by Britain exceeds two-thirds of the total, and the population reaches one-half of the total. Therefore, Britain is most concerned about Germany's request to recover its former colonies. The British Cabinet is now preparing to discuss how to deal with it. France and Belgium seem to have a more indifferent attitude than Britain because they gained less. As for the places ruled by Japan, it is said that Germany had expressed its willingness to abandon them when concluding the Japan-Germany Agreement.

Germany's request to recover its colonies was raised once in April 1924 when the Allied representatives discussed the Young Plan. However, the Allied representatives not only did not accept this request but also expressed great dissatisfaction. Because Germany was eager for the Young Plan to be established, it had to withdraw its representatives to quell the public's anger. In June 1933, the World Economic Conference opened in London. At that time, the National Socialist Party had already taken control of the German regime. The German representative, Hugenberg, once again raised this request. The result was the same as Schacht's, and he was rebuffed. However, since Germany unilaterally abandoned the Locarno Pact last year and was able to achieve its wish due to the internal contradictions of Britain, France, and Italy, the leaders of the German Socialist Party felt that the time to raise this request had come again.

Why is Germany so determined to recover its colonies? Originally, under Hitler's rule, due to the excessive expansion of armaments, Germany's finances and national economy experienced a serious panic. To overcome this panic and divert the attention of the people at home, it had to seek development abroad. And recovering the old colonies is the loudest slogan in the outward expansion. However, colonies are the lifeline of imperialism and the main factor in the conflict between imperialist countries. It is certainly not an easy task for Germany to recover the old colonies that were lost long ago from those imperialist countries.

### League of Nations Discusses Trafficking in Women and Children

Our Representative Vigorously Condemns Concessions

Bandung, Java The League of Nations conference to discuss the issue of trafficking in women and children opened here today. The Chinese representative spoke, vigorously condemning foreign concessions in China, saying that they provide sanctuary for those who traffic in women, because foreign concessions do not have proper management methods for issuing women's passports. The representative of the British Straits Settlements, Jordan, rose to defend, detailing the methods used by foreigners in the East to prevent trafficking in women, and saying that the General Affairs Office in China that handles this matter was not established until 1933. The meeting today also discussed the establishment of a General Affairs Office in the League of Nations to handle this matter. (Central News Agency, 4th, Reuters)

### The Lin Cabinet and the Parliament Have Already Had an Initial Skirmish

Japanese Emperor Orders Parliament to Be Suspended for Seven Days - Generally Regarded as a Prelude to Political Turmoil

[Tokyo] The new Prime Minister, Hayashi Senjuro, has already had an initial "battle" with the House of Representatives. The government initially requested the House of Representatives to suspend its session for ten days so that the differences between the army and the political parties could be reconciled in a calm manner. The House of Representatives refused. Thereupon, Prime Minister Hayashi obtained the Emperor's order and announced that the parliament would be suspended from the 4th to the 10th. The public regards this matter as a precursor to political turmoil, because when the government presents the army-dominated massive budget in the parliament in the future, it will definitely stir up a great storm. (Central News Agency, 4th, Reuters)

[Tokyo] It has always been the custom that if a coup d'état occurs during the parliamentary recess and a new cabinet is formed, the parliament will automatically adjourn during its preparation period. However, this time, the various factions of the House of Representatives did not follow the previous example and refused the government's request, which shows their dissatisfaction with the new cabinet and is a prelude to the attitude of political parties towards the government in the parliament in the future. Its trend is worthy of great attention. (Domei, 4th)

[Tokyo] For the sake of revising the budget案 and other preparations, the government has requested a week's suspension of the session from the 4th, and the suspension decree has been promulgated on the same day. The reason why the suspension period is specifically limited to one week is that the term of the regular parliament is until March 25, and the budget deliberation period for both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives is 21 days each. Now that the session is suspended for only one week, the budget案 has to be submitted to the House of Representatives on the 11th. It is also inappropriate to imagine extending the session in advance and submit the budget案. Therefore, from this point of view, the session is suspended for one week. However, the government's policies and programs have not yet been concretely decided. By the time the session is reopened, more than 20 days have passed, so it is planned to limit the bills to be submitted to the parliament to the most important ones. However, even so, due to the budget relations and the tax system reform bills, there are quite a few, so the parliamentary session may not be avoided from being extended. (Domei, 4th)

[Tokyo] Although the Seiyukai has decided that there is no need to express enthusiastic support to the cabinet during the week of parliamentary recess, it has not decided to directly oppose it. Some Seiyukai members firmly advocate that when the parliament reopens, they should ask the Hayashi cabinet why it refuses to allow members of political parties to join the cabinet, and that this unconstitutional attitude must be impeached. However, important party members insist on a cautious attitude. The Minseito maintains a benevolent neutrality and will explain its attitude after the new cabinet announces its policy direction. Both the Seiyukai and the Minseito seem to be cautiously avoiding dissolving the parliament. The Social Masses Party announced today that the Hayashi cabinet has nothing to do with the people at all and should rather be called an "anti-people cabinet." Such a cabinet is bound to be criticized as an "error of the times" and should resign immediately. The party firmly advocates dissolving the existing parliament and holding a re-election so that the party's organization can be expanded. The Hayashi cabinet still has no intention of dissolving the parliament, and it is not yet known whether the Ministry of the Army will insist on Terauchi's attitude. However, there is no doubt that the navy has no intention of dissolving the parliament. Complex forces behind the scenes are brewing, so it is extremely difficult to predict the future. The various divergent actions this week are the most important factors in determining whether the existing parliament will be finally dissolved. (Central News Agency, 4th)

### Japanese Budget Will Be Reviewed Again

Lin Cabinet Policy - First Stabilize People's Hearts

[Tokyo] Finance Minister Yuuki Kiyoshi, regarding countermeasures to suppress the high cost of commodities, gave a speech saying, "The Ministry of Finance intends to promptly seek countermeasures regarding the high cost of commodities, but now it will not immediately adopt manpower policies, such as the profiteering crackdown law, which should be the last resort. The root cause of the rise in prices is the excessive budget. Cutting it is the fundamental countermeasure. But there are still parliamentary relations, and the contents of the fiscal 1937 budget must be thoroughly reviewed again. There is no time to completely reorganize it, so it can only be slightly modified and then submitted to the parliament. It is intended to fully change it when implementing the budget. If the government's policy can be thoroughly implemented, prices will naturally be suppressed." (Domei, 4th)

[Tokyo] Regarding the Lin cabinet's policy program, the cabinet meeting on the 4th continued to exchange opinions. The general trend in the cabinet is that stabilizing the people's hearts is the prerequisite at this time, so elaborating on concrete policy programs can be put off for later. At present, Prime Minister Lin should explain the fundamental policy direction of the Lin cabinet in the form of a speech, and must explain the importance of the current situation, the actual state of international affairs, and the urgency of strengthening national defense. At the same time, regarding the stability of the people's lives, he should express the government's beliefs. Chief Secretary Oohashi and Director-General Kawagoe of the Legislation Bureau are drafting a draft based on this theme, which will be completed within a few days, approved by the cabinet, and then announced. (Domei, 4th)

[Tokyo] The government has decided to withdraw the next fiscal year's budget plan submitted to the parliament by the previous cabinet, review it, and then submit it to the reopened parliament. Therefore, Finance Minister Yuuki Kiyoshi frankly exchanged opinions with the cabinet members on this matter at the cabinet meeting on the 4th, and as a result, it has been generally decided that the current cabinet will make a considerable degree of revision to the budget plan compiled by the previous cabinet from its own standpoint. However, due to the suspension period and other relations, it is difficult to express the points of revision in writing in a short time due to printing and other relations. Therefore, it is planned to indicate the revision direction of the current cabinet in the policy speech of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, and to clarify the purpose of realizing this revision direction when compiling and implementing the budget in the future. The budget plan will still be submitted again according to the original案. (Domei, 4th)

### Unbreakable Singapore Military Port Fortress

Imaginary Enemy Attack Unsuccessful, Naval, Land, and Air Force Exercises Conclude

[Singapore] The newly constructed fort in this port has been proven impregnable after this large-scale naval, land, and air force exercise. The imaginary enemy in this attack was an independent country with a small but powerful navy and air force, and its army was equipped with the latest weapons. However, after intensive attacks, it ultimately failed to seize the Singapore fortress. The enemy's air force was forced to retreat, and the position of the enemy's ships was detected by the defending air force. Therefore, the enemy forces were unable to land. The clear weather at night was conducive to a final assault, but by dawn, the situation in all parts of Singapore was secure. The attacking forces were led by Vice Admiral Little, Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy in China, while the defending forces were commanded by Lieutenant General Doby, Commander-in-Chief of Malaya. A total of 8,000 soldiers participated, including sailors, soldiers, airmen, and troops from Johor. All available warships from the British fleet stationed in China participated in the exercise, and the air force participants included two squadrons of torpedo bombers and two squadrons of flying boats, based in Singapore. There was also a squadron of aircraft from the aircraft carrier HMS Hermes and squadrons of Spitfire aircraft stationed at Sembawang, Seletar, and Paya Lebar, as well as squadrons of aircraft from Iraq and India. The number of air force participants remains secret. (Central News Agency, 4th, Reuters)

### British Cabinet Discusses Foreign Affairs

Involving the Spanish Question

[London] The Cabinet held a meeting today. According to political figures, foreign affairs were the primary focus of discussion. Lord Plymouth, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Chairman of the Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War, was invited to attend to report on the monitoring plan proposed by the Adjustment Committee. The monitoring methods currently under consideration include the following: ㊀ Monitoring of import locations along the land and sea borders of Spain; ㊁ Inspection of ships of all countries sailing from foreign ports to Spain; In addition, naval surveillance will be carried out by the navies of several countries outside Spanish territorial waters. The Adjustment Committee sent the above plan to the governments of the countries concerned on the 28th of last month, requesting them to submit replies by the 4th of this month. It is generally believed that the British reply has been drafted by the Cabinet and will be sent to the Adjustment Committee tomorrow. (Havas, 3rd)

### Germany Refines Coal into Oil in the Ruhr

Fuel Self-Sufficiency

[Berlin] Four factories have been built in the Ruhr coal mining area in the past two months, all using coal evaporation to extract kerosene. It is reported that several more large factories of this type will be built soon. For example, Thyssen is already building a new factory, and the Gelsenberg "Hibernia" factory will issue 55 million marks in bonds in addition to its existing capital of 50 million marks to finance its expansion. Germany has decided not to rely on other countries for its kerosene needs, as can be seen from this. (Havas, 3rd)

### The Era of European Declarations Has Passed, Now Entering the Diplomatic Path

All Negotiations Still Led by Britain; Colonial Issues Cannot Be Discussed

[Paris] French Foreign Minister Delbos stated today in the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies regarding the speech made by German leader Hitler that the overall situation is the same as when British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Prime Minister Blum recently gave speeches, with no change. Public talks have now ended and diplomatic talks will continue. The British government is most concerned about Hitler's demands for colonies and his rejection of disarmament. Therefore, any initiative today will be led by the British government. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Reuters)

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden adopted an evasive attitude towards inquiries in the House of Commons regarding the Western European Pact and Germany's demands for colonies, merely replying based on previous declarations. Only when the Liberal Party's Foot Lambert inquired about the government's view as to whether safeguarding the integrity and neutrality of the Netherlands and Belgium required Germany's consent, did Eden give a specific answer, stating that Germany's relations with its western neighbors would be considered when negotiating a new system to guarantee the security of Western Europe. These negotiations are currently underway. (National Telegraph, 3rd)

[London] Today, the British House of Commons discussed the issue of mandated territories. Foreign Secretary Eden reiterated that the British government is determined to proceed in accordance with the previously announced policy. Today, Mander, a Liberal Party member of the opposition, asked Eden what methods the British government would adopt to deal with Germany's demands for colonies, as mentioned in Hitler's speech last Saturday. Eden replied that he had made a statement on this issue on July 27 of last year and did not wish to say more now. In July of last year, Eden declared that the British government was willing to discuss the issue of facilitating foreign procurement of raw materials from mandated territories at an international conference, but the issue of transferring territorial sovereignty concerned all the countries under mandate, and the British government had not discussed it with the major powers. However, as far as Britain itself was concerned, it felt that this issue would cause unavoidable difficulties and would be unresolvable in terms of morality, politics, and law. During the discussion of the raw materials issue, Labour Party member Burke questioned Eden again, asking if he could assure the House that he would never propose the transfer of mandated territories as a result. Eden repeatedly said, "Of course, of course." (Central News Agency, 3rd, Reuters)

[London] Regarding Germany's demand for the restoration of its former colonies, the British government is still hesitating whether to start talks with Germany or adopt a reserved attitude until the German government provides further explanations. During yesterday's cabinet meeting, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, Home Secretary Simon, and Lord President of the Council Hailsham were said to have advocated that Britain must exhaust all means to negotiate with Germany before abandoning all hope. They did so not because they supported Germany's demands, but because British public opinion was not without sympathy for Germany, and they therefore advocated studying Germany's views from all aspects, and said that German Ambassador Ribbentrop had been back home for a long time, and after returning to his post this time, he should, as a matter of routine, visit the Foreign Office, and the authorities of the Foreign Office should take the opportunity to make contact with him. On the other hand, the authorities in the Foreign Office said that the speech recently delivered by German leader Hitler did not present any new factors that could serve as the basis for conducting negotiations, and it was not appropriate for Britain to launch any initiative and raise questions to Germany at this time. There are differences in the views held by the various cabinet members on this issue, which is a matter of form. However, they have reached a consensus on consulting the French government. (Havas, 4th)

[Paris] Newspapers close to the French Foreign Ministry mentioned the colonial issue referred to in Hitler's speech, saying that it had been learned that Britain and France had the same view on this issue, namely, that the colonial issue could not be separated from the various issues that were being resolved. (National Telegraph, 3rd)

[London] German Ambassador to the United Kingdom Ribbentrop, who recently returned to his country to report on his work, has now returned to his post. (Havas, 3rd)

[Berlin] British newspapers reported that German Ambassador to the United Kingdom Ribbentrop brought with him a memorandum of Germany's demands for colonies when he returned to London. Political circles here pointed out that this was unlikely because Berlin had not drafted such a memorandum. (National Telegraph, 3rd)

[London] Regarding the issue of Germany's demand for the return of its former colonies, the Daily Telegraph reported that German Ambassador to the United Kingdom Ribbentrop would not submit this issue to the British Foreign Office for negotiation at present, because the establishment of peace in continental Europe required cooperation between Germany and its friendly countries. If this level of security cannot be guaranteed, then the issue of redistributing the rights granted to various countries outside Europe cannot be raised for discussion. (Havas, 4th)

[Berlin] German leader Hitler hosted a banquet for the diplomatic corps tonight. All the heads of diplomatic missions attended, and most of the cabinet members were present. (Havas, 3rd)

### French Finance Minister Explains Financial Situation to the Chamber of Deputies

Budget Deficit of 4.6 Billion Francs; Issue Long-Term Public Bonds to Make Up for It

[Paris] Finance Minister Olivol attended the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies today to explain the government's financial situation, stating that according to the 1937 budget, the net deficit was 4,600,000,000 francs. Expenditure on military equipment, public works, and other temporary items totaled 13,685,000,000 francs, and pensions payable amounted to 2,200,000,000 francs. In total, the Ministry of Finance should raise 20,485,000,000 francs. This amount will be made up by the government issuing long-term public bonds worth 20 billion francs. In the past few years, France's finances have been in deficit, and the amount of debt raised each year is roughly the same as this amount. As for the present, the Ministry of Finance is trying to collect various overdue taxes within a time limit and deposit them into the national treasury. The next three or four months will be a difficult period for the national treasury to collect taxes each year, but the Ministry of Finance has prepared proper measures to ensure turnover. Furthermore, during the tenure of previous cabinets, the loans granted by the Bank of France to the national treasury were mostly of a non-public nature and were not included in the bank's reports. The current cabinet has abolished this long-standing practice. As a result, the loans granted by the Bank of France to the national treasury have been clearly recorded in the reports, and the amount of loans must also comply with a certain limit. On December 31, 1936, the total amount of loans granted by the Bank of France to the national treasury was 5,400,000,000 francs, and the total amount of treasury bills issued by the Ministry of Finance circulating in the market was 9,000,000,000 francs, totaling 14,400,000,000 francs. However, the maximum amount of loans from the Bank of France is set at 10,000,000,000 francs, and the maximum amount of treasury bills in circulation is also 10,000,000,000 francs. The sum of the two is 20,000,000,000 francs. Therefore, the national treasury still has a surplus of 5,600,000,000 francs for turnover. The Finance Minister finally said that, according to the past few months, the deposits of various banks have increased by 263,000,000 francs, which shows that small savers have confidence in the government. Not only that, but France's overall economic situation is improving day by day, and the tax revenue situation is getting better and better. All this is obvious to all. (Havas, 3rd)

### U.S. President Proposes Long-Term Construction Plan

Undertake Public Works to Prevent Floods; Requires US$50 Billion Over Six Years

[Washington] President Roosevelt sent a message to Congress today, requesting that long-term construction policies be adopted to prevent future economic downturns. The plan proposed by the President includes a flood control project that will cost US$27.5 billion, of which US$116 million will be used to construct dikes along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. The contents of the message are largely based on the recommendations of the National Resources Committee, which was established by the President's order. The President is now requesting that the committee be transformed into a permanent planning agency to coordinate national construction projects. According to the committee's recommendations, each type of project must be planned for six years and can be modified annually. The President also proposed allocating another US$100,000 for the United States and Canada to jointly investigate the economic value of constructing the Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Project. (National Telegraph, 3rd)

[Washington] U.S. President Roosevelt submitted a flood control plan to Congress today, proposing to spend US$50 billion in six years. The plan was prepared by the National Resources Committee to prevent the recurrence of floods. According to the plan, it is now proposed to immediately use US$116 million to improve existing locks and dams and to build reservoirs in the Ohio River Basin and the lower Mississippi River. The plan also proposes to build hundreds of special irrigation canals across the country, some of which are planned to be implemented immediately, while the rest will be used as work relief projects in the event of a future economic downturn.

President Roosevelt received news this afternoon that the water level at the dangerous site of Cairo, Illinois, had eased somewhat, but that the danger period would continue for the next four days. It is reported that the dams downstream are still able to withstand the floodwaters, but the patrol teams on the Cairo levee are still monitoring the water level day and night. The water level in Louisville, Kentucky, is gradually receding but is still 20 feet above flood stage. There are currently 500 shackled prisoners in Memphis, Tennessee, assisting in the construction of sandbag levees, and they will likely be rewarded with reduced sentences. The government previously purchased cattle from the drought-stricken areas of the Midwest and processed them into canned beef, which is now being used to feed the flood victims.

### Damage Estimates in Various Areas

Furthermore, reports of deaths and damage estimates from various flooded areas have been successively sent in. In Louisville alone, the total number of deaths has reached 221, with approximately 220,000 homeless. Property damage is estimated at around US$200 million. Total losses in Kentucky are estimated at US$350 million. In Illinois, approximately 8,000 people are homeless. In Osceola, Arkansas, 35 people have died and 45,000 are homeless. In Evansville, Indiana, 11 deaths have been reported and 265,000 are homeless. Property damage in Huntington, West Virginia, is estimated at US$500,000, with total damage in the state estimated at US$100 million. In Virginia, 14 people have died, 10,000 are homeless, and property damage is US$6 million. In Cincinnati, 14 people have died and property damage is US$15 million. Property damage in Ohio is US$27 million. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Reuters)

### On-Site Inspection of Disaster Conditions

Cairo: The flood investigation committee appointed by President Roosevelt arrived here today to inspect the disaster area. At the same time, Works Progress Administration Director Hopkins promised that the federal government would do its best to assist in future recovery plans. The rescue work in Cairo is proceeding well. The water level of the Ohio River did not change today, and the levees remain intact. The weather bureau predicts that it will rain again tonight and snow tomorrow. However, it is believed that the amount of precipitation will not change the current situation. (National Telegraph, 3rd)

Cairo: The hope of this place avoiding submersion has greatly increased. The Ohio River's water level has remained unchanged today, stopping at fifty-nine and a half feet, very close to the top of the sixty-foot high levee. However, the levee is still capable of withstanding the impact of the raging waves, so the 6,000 rescue workers stationed there feel that Cairo may be spared. However, a climate forecast report says that it will rain within 36 hours, which is quite disturbing, and there are still 120,000 workers along the Mississippi River rushing to build dams. (Central News Agency, 4th, Reuters)

### U.S. Maritime Workers' Strike Voting Results

Majority Favorable to Resuming Work

[San Francisco] The results of the maritime union workers' vote to end the West Coast strike will be announced this afternoon. According to unofficial reports from three port unions received a few days ago, a total of 3,299 people favored an immediate return to work, and 50-something opposed it. (National Telegraph, 3rd)

### President Roosevelt Intervenes in Automobile Industry Strike

Michigan Governor Conducts Mediation; Prospects for Peaceful Resolution Are Promising

Detroit, Michigan: Lewis, the leader of the Committee for Industrial Organization, which is leading the automobile industry strike, has resumed negotiations with Knudsen, Vice President of General Motors, to resolve the strike. Prior to this, the workers had met once because President Roosevelt had intervened, and the meeting lasted ninety minutes. During the meeting, Michigan Governor Murphy chaired as the President's representative and suggested the following two points as the basis for discussion: ㊀ The company must recognize the Automobile Workers' Union as the sole representative of the workers for negotiation purposes; ㊁ The striking workers occupying the factories should leave the factories first, provided that the company guarantees that it will not start work before the strike is resolved. (National Telegraph, 3rd)

Detroit: Tonight, after the meeting between the automobile workers and the General Motors authorities, Michigan Governor Murphy gave a speech, saying that the meeting lasted four and a half hours, and both sides were very frank and cautious, with a great sense of mutual assistance. Another meeting will continue to be held at 10:00 tomorrow morning. Murphy also said that he would consult with Federal Government Labour Mediation Commissioner Dewey tonight on mediation methods. At the beginning of today's meeting, Chevrolet Motor Company General Manager and General Motors Vice President Cuno left the meeting place for a moment. He told people, "Nothing has been resolved yet." However, since Murphy has managed to convene this meeting, there is still hope for a peaceful resolution. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Reuters)

Flint: Genesee County Sheriff Holger declared today that he did not intend to execute the court order at the Fisher Body factory and evict the workers from the factory unless General Motors made a request. The workers also said that they were determined to refuse to leave the factory. Therefore, although the Sheriff said that they would lead many people to go if the court insisted on execution, they also made it clear that they did not like this matter. Subsequently, the Sheriff's Office said that Holger had requested the National Guard to patrol in front of the First Factory because 3,000 workers had demonstrated in front of the First Factory and hundreds of workers had entered the factory afterward. However, the National Guard Commander did not grant the request, and the Sheriff had no choice but to ask the State Police Department to send more police officers to maintain order. (National Telegraph, 3rd)

Flint: Although the court ruled that the automobile strikers occupying the factory buildings were illegal, they still refused to withdraw. Today, the situation has eased. Mayor Pratt has reached an agreement with the union leaders. The workers agreed to avoid disturbances by appointment, and the municipal authorities agreed to withdraw 100 special police officers. (National Telegraph, 3rd)

### Italy and Germany Continue to Aid Spanish Rebels

A Unit of Italian Soldiers Lands in Cadiz; German Cruiser Escorts Rebel Attack on Malaga

[London] It seems that the outside world has confirmed today that another unit of Italian volunteers arrived in Cadiz, southern Spain, on the 29th of last month, but the number is not large. (National Telegraph, 3rd)

[London] Regarding the activities of Germany and Italy in Spain, newspapers here have recently revealed more details. The Times correspondent in Gibraltar declared that the German cruisers "Admiral Graf Spee" and "Köln" and the Spanish Nationalist cruisers "Canarias," "Baleares," and "Almirante Cervera" have successively arrived in Algeciras in southern Spain. "It is rumored that General Dávila, Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist Southern Route, is on the German cruiser "Admiral Graf Spee."" Some in Gibraltar believe that the German cruisers "Admiral Graf Spee" and "Köln" will escort the warships of the Spanish Nationalist forces to attack Malaga. In addition, the News Chronicle reported that a recent batch of Italian volunteers had arrived in Spain to serve in the Nationalist forces. Although the exact number is unknown, Italy's move proves that it intends to continue to assist the Spanish Nationalist forces before the monitoring plan proposed by the London Adjustment Committee is implemented. The amount of German weapons transported to the Nationalists is also large, especially aircraft. (Havas, 4th)

Malaga: The Nationalist forces launched a fierce offensive yesterday in the vicinity of this port, in the villages of Matela, El Borge, and others. In addition, a submarine bombarded the coast of this port, but there was no damage or casualties. (Havas, 4th)

### Turkish-Italian Reconciliation

Italy Complies with the Straits Convention

Milan: The Italian government issued a communiqué stating that both countries have decided to cooperate in complying with the Dardanelles Straits Convention for the benefit of Italian-Turkish relations. According to the Straits Convention signed at the Montreux Conference on July 20 of last year, Turkey is allowed to rebuild defense works on the islands of Imbros and Tenedos in the Aegean Sea and is allowed to immediately redeploy military equipment in the Dardanelles. In the event of war, if Turkey remains neutral, the Dardanelles Strait will be closed to all warships of belligerent countries, except for warships that are obliged to pass under the League of Nations Covenant. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Reuters)

Milan: Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü Aras will visit Yugoslavia after the end of talks with the Italian government to discuss the Balkan Pact conference to be convened in Athens in mid-month with the Prime Minister of that country. Because Yugoslavia is paying close attention to Italian foreign policy, the Turkish Foreign Minister will report on the details of the Italian-Turkish talks. (National Telegraph, 3rd)

### Japanese Study Promotes Large-Scale Immigration to Northeast China

Based on Past Failures, They Start with Research, Comparing Northeast China's Climate and Soil with Japan

Changchun Dispatch: Regarding agricultural immigration to Northeast China, Japan, learning from past failures, is now starting with research into Northeast China's climate, soil, wind power utilization, animal husbandry institutions, and other related issues. They are comparing these with conditions in Japan, as they are actively promoting large-scale agricultural immigration to Northeast China. Here is a record of various Japanese surveys in Northeast China, divided as follows: Climate Comparison The Japanese claim that, regarding the climate comparison between Northeast China and Japan, Northeast China has a continental climate. Although there are slight differences between southern and northern Manchuria, the situation is generally the same for crops. For example, regarding the actual situation in Yongfeng Town, according to the Yilan Observatory's report on temperature conditions, the months of May, June, and July are no different from Sakhalin, Aomori, and other places in Japan. Furthermore, the climate in August is also the same as Aomori in Japan. As for September, the temperature in Yongfeng Town is lower than in Aomori, Japan, but by this time, the crops have largely matured. Furthermore, regarding the duration of sunshine, there is quite a bit of safety. The amount of rainfall is no more than one-sixth of that in Japan, around 500 hao. This amount of rainfall is considered optimal for crops. For example, Japan's rainfall is too high, which is detrimental to crops. In particular, there are many places in inland Japan where forests have been over-logged, with the intention of reducing rainfall. Utilizing Wind Power

The Japanese are currently studying the issue of wind power utilization, which is necessary for immigrant farming villages in Northeast China. As for livestock, flour milling, power generation, etc., in the future, regarding the institutional structure of immigrant farming villages, the so-called policy of reducing labor and improving conditions will be implemented to seek a new development in the operation of immigrant farming villages.

Soil of Northern Manchuria

The soil of Northern Manchuria is all virgin land. Therefore, the vegetables produced in that area are all cultivated without fertilizer. The quality of oats and wheat is also good, and the bread made from them is of excellent quality. Other crops such as soybeans, sorghum, and corn also produce well throughout Northeast China. Furthermore, the unique crop of flax is better than in Hokkaido. Other unique crops such as mulberry, sugar beets (sugar roots), and grapes are also good, and the results for vegetables are no worse than in Japan, so there is no sense of restriction.

Animal Husbandry Institutions

The Japanese consider animal husbandry to be a necessary item for agricultural immigration. For the sake of self-sufficiency, it is necessary to raise livestock to promote the development of animal husbandry resources and make improvements. Therefore, the issue of breeding farms, etc., is currently under study. It has been found that the types of livestock raised within the agricultural institutions that incorporate animal husbandry institutions include sheep, pigs, bees, horses, etc. However, all of the sheep are spread across the entire village, totaling 600 head. The breeding results have not changed compared to southern Manchuria, and expanding the land is extremely beneficial for sheep breeding. This will establish new development along with the development of agricultural immigration institutions.

Related Issues

Regarding the cold, climate, and living conditions of farmers in the immigration area, comparing the situation in Japan and Northeast China, Japanese winters are not equipped with cold protection facilities. The Japanese are based on a cold-resistant lifestyle. However, indoor cold protection facilities in Northeast China are extremely thorough. The houses where immigrants live will be very satisfactory. However, regarding the issue of preventing frostbite and other illnesses in children who play or exercise outdoors during the winter, this is an extremely important issue that deserves further study.

### Detailed Report on the Capsizing of the Yongxin Steamer Between Shanghai and Huzhou

More than Forty Passengers Drowned, and Silk Stores in Huzhou Also Suffered Significant Losses

Suzhou Dispatch: The Yongxin steamer, on the Shanghai-Huzhou route of the Yongsheng Shipping Bureau, departed from Huzhou for Shanghai on the third day of the month. When it passed the Niuziwei turn at the ferry crossing, about three li from Pingwang Town, it was noon. Because the ship was overloaded, the passengers leaned to one side when turning, causing the ship to tilt and immediately capsize. The situation was briefly described in yesterday's newspaper. It has now been learned that when the steamer set sail from Huzhou that day, it carried more than 70 passengers, as well as sailors, etc. At that time, everyone fell into the river. The captain, Yao Fagen, and the accountant, Zhang Zhenfu, were fortunately rescued immediately. More than 30 first-class passengers were also not drowned. However, more than 40 second and third-class passengers were not spared. Because they could not get out of the cabins, they all suffocated inside, which is truly tragic. After the accident, the head of the Pingwang Public Security Branch Bureau, Huang Ren, not only took Zhang Zhenfu and Yao Fagen to the bureau for questioning, but also immediately dispatched a large number of police officers to work with the Pingwang Yongsheng Shipping Bureau to summon many net boat operators to try to salvage the bodies. After 24 hours of effort, by 2:00 p.m. on the fourth day, a total of ten bodies were recovered, including seven men and three women. One was He Zhu, 31 years old, from Linghu. Her husband, He Zairong, works at the Jinye Exchange at 69 Jiujiang Road in Shanghai. Her relative, Zeng, who lives in Pingwang, has telegraphed her husband in Shanghai to quickly come and take care of the aftermath. One was Zhong Yinglong, 45 years old, from Yanmu. His family has gone to identify the body. One was Yin Fuji, from Lili. His body has been taken away by his family for burial. There are still seven bodies that have not been claimed. A large number of bodies suffocated inside the ship cannot be salvaged for the time being. The ship must be lifted before the bodies can be recovered. The Shanghai General Bureau sent people to transport a crane to the scene of the accident on the fourth day. It is estimated that the ship will be lifted today (the fifth day). There are also more than 80 pieces of luggage and goods that have been salvaged, which are currently guarded by the Public Security Branch Bureau for the owners to claim. After this incident occurred, it caused a sensation in various townships of Wujiang. On the fourth day, no fewer than 10,000 people went to watch. They all said that this was an unprecedented tragedy in Wujiang. After learning about the situation at 4:00 p.m., many families from Huzhou took cars to the scene of the accident to inquire. There were quite a few people who were wailing and crying over the sunken ship. There were also those who were supporting the elderly and carrying the young, waiting on the shore for the bodies to be discovered. The tragic scene was heartbreaking. Xu Yangchuan, the magistrate of Wujiang County, paid great attention to this case. On the morning of the fourth day, he personally took a car to Pingwang, accompanied by the district chief, Ding Shou, and the head of the Public Security Branch Bureau, Huang Ren, to conduct an on-site inspection of the scene of the accident. He inquired about the truth of what happened and briefly inspected the bodies that had been salvaged one by one. He also comforted the families of the victims with kind words and instructed Huang, the head of the branch bureau, to quickly find a way to salvage the bodies. At noon, he returned to the city. It was also heard that the Shanghai-Huzhou daytime small steamers, in addition to carrying passengers, also transported crepe gauze and wide crepe, etc., produced in Huzhou for various silk stores in Huzhou. Each trip carried more than five or six hundred pieces, so the business was very developed. On the day of the accident, the ship was also carrying a hundred pieces of crepe gauze, which was of great value. Various silk stores also suffered great losses. This was truly an unexpected disaster.

### Xiamen Timber Merchants Request Abolition of Excessive and Miscellaneous Taxes on Timber

The Finance Department Newly Established Special Business Tax on Fir Timber; Timber Rafts in Western Fujian Have Been Suspended for Nearly a Month

Xiamen Dispatch: The Xiamen Timber Industry Association, due to the Finance Department's new imposition of a special business tax on fir timber in Punan, Zhangzhou (40 li from Zhangzhou along the Jiulong River), which caused timber merchants in western Fujian to stop transporting timber rafts, affecting the source of fir timber, specially submitted a petition to the provincial government on February 1st, requesting the abolition of the excessive and miscellaneous taxes along the Jiulong River's North Stream and Punan, the cancellation of the special business tax, and the correction of the Xiamen timber industry business tax rate. The original petition stated, "Your association has previously submitted a petition to your office regarding the illegal collection of Xiamen timber industry business tax, requesting that the tax rate be ordered to be corrected. However, the Finance Department, citing the fact that it was the beginning of the recovery of Fujian Province and that the provincial treasury was short of funds and expenditures were heavy, advised that it be temporarily paid as before. Although the members of your association felt that the burden was unbearable, they勉强maintained it due to provincial needs. Now that the political situation is becoming more stable and tax revenues in various prefectures are becoming more abundant, we hope that the tax rate will be corrected according to the previous approval order to lighten the burden. Unexpectedly, not only has the tax rate in this city not been corrected, but the Finance Department has instead established a special business tax in Beixi Punan, the timber production area, setting a high tax rate and drastically increasing the burden on merchants and people, causing local timber merchants to stop transporting timber rafts. Xiamen fir timber mostly depends on that area for supply. Now, due to the suspension of transportation and the market being cut off, it has been nearly a month, which has greatly affected business. The Ministry of Finance has clearly stipulated that the business tax on timber is 0.2%. Since Beixi fir timber is not foreign goods, why should a special business tax be established to increase the burden on domestic products? Moreover, according to investigations, miscellaneous taxes along the way from the production area to Beixi reach more than 140 yuan per raft (according to investigations, there are 17 types of excessive and miscellaneous taxes on timber along the Jiulong River, with each timber raft being levied a donation of more than 147 yuan). Compared with the ordinary donation amount of more than 200 yuan per fir timber raft, the burden is more than one-half of the value of the goods. The burden is truly unprecedented in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Therefore, in recent years, domestic timber has been unable to compete with foreign goods, foreign timber has flooded the market, timber merchants have suffered, and carpenters have lost their jobs. If excessive and miscellaneous taxes are not abolished quickly, not only are timber merchants in danger of bankruptcy, but the purpose of protecting domestic products and rescuing rural areas will be lost. Now, not only have the current excessive and miscellaneous taxes not been abolished, but a heavy special business tax has been added, which is tantamount to adding insult to injury, pushing the future of the timber industry into a dead end. The suspension of timber raft transportation by timber merchants in Beixi is a powerful manifestation of the timber industry approaching a dead end. Your National Government has always placed great emphasis on people's livelihood and cannot bear to see these tens of thousands of people who depend on timber production and timber products for a living facing extinction due to the unbearable burden of donations and taxes. Therefore, we hereby respectfully request that you review and approve our request to abolish excessive and miscellaneous taxes and cancel the special business tax." (February 3rd)

Currently, it is also in the overall planning stage, and it is expected to be realized next month.

False Accusation of Selling Opium by Impersonation

Gao Yutang, a private school teacher in Gaoxiaotao, Tenth Bao, Maqiao Township, Fourth District, Jiangdu, is in his sixties, with upright character and pure learning. His son also follows the rules and has no bad habits. Unexpectedly, someone impersonated the names of Luo Wenjin, Wei Guangming, and six or seven other people to accuse him of selling opium in the county. The county ordered the district to send personnel to search Gao's house, but there was no trace of opium sales. When Luo, Wei, and six or seven other people named in the original complaint were summoned to the district for questioning, they all denied having filed a complaint and guaranteed that they had no suspicion of opium sales. It is planned to jointly submit a petition to the county government to investigate the impersonation.

Reducing and Exempting Excessive Donations and Miscellaneous Taxes

Various excessive donations and miscellaneous taxes in Jiaxing have been resolved by the provincial donation and tax supervision meeting to be presented to the provincial government for announcement of reduction and exemption.

Those that should be abolished in Jiaxing have now been decided, including telephone pole usage fees, electric light pole usage fees, and property donations (except for those that are taxed at 50% of the deed tax or approved to continue to be taxed at one yuan per mu).

### Pinghu

Completion of Land Registry

After the former Zhejiang Chairman Huang Shaohong agreed with Xiao Zheng, the director of the Central Land Administration College, to designate Pinghu as a land administration experimental county, aerial surveying, residential land resurveying, area calculation and mapping, and registration were completed in a few months. The cost of aerial surveying per mu was 5.4 li, the cost of resurveying per mu was 4 li, the cost of area calculation was 5 li, the cost of mapping was 4 li, and the cost of registration per mu was 1.5 fen, totaling no more than 1 jiao per mu. According to the results of measurement and registration, the land area is more than 765,500 mu. According to the original Pinghu grain acreage of only more than 460,000 mu, about 300,000 mu of grain land has been added. Based on the current quota allocation, each mu can be reduced by 4 jiao, with a maximum of no more than 7 jiao per year. The county is currently rushing to handle land value tax and plans to start collecting it in the first phase of the 26th year. After that, people will pay taxes according to the land value, and the drawbacks of having land without grain or having grain without land can be eliminated. The burden can be reduced, and government revenue can be enriched.

### Zhang Yingda Loses Form in Class A Pistol Shooting Championship, Zhu Qiliang Takes the Lead

Two or Three Points More in Total for the Two Rounds; Who Will Win the Championship? Watch Today's Two Rounds

In the Shanghai Amateur Class A Pistol Shooting Championship, Zhu Qiliang calmly fought in the first day's final held in the association yesterday, taking a favorable position with 1,000 points to 767. There are still two games to be played today at 5:30 p.m. and 9:00 p.m., with the goal of 1,000 points. If Zhang Yingda can display his unparalleled and fluent marksmanship of the past, then he may have a considerable hope today. Who will win the championship? Let's wait and see how Zhang works hard.

Zhu Qiliang's progress is so fast that it can be said to be a thousand miles in a day. His performance has been particularly good in the recent two games. Yesterday's battle was serious with every shot. Both rounds were wonderful. More than 20 points were scored 13 times in the first round and 8 times in the second round. Therefore, he has a good result of winning two or three points more. If he can maintain his normal state today, then he can taste the championship of this competition.

In the first round, Zhu Qiliang was ahead of Zhang Yingda in eight or nine out of ten shots, but the difference between the two was extremely small, at most more than 30 points, around 460 points. Zhang was still in the lead. Then Zhu suddenly scored two huge points, reaching 500 points first, while Zhang had 481 points. In the second round, Zhu did great, almost scoring every time, and he was able to take preventive measures to prevent the opponent from starting. This is the main reason why the number of points he led by gradually increased. With one shot of 51 points, he actually had 190 points more (759 to 569). Afterwards, he exceeded more than 200 points, resulting in a large lead of 1,000 points to 767 points on the first day.

Zhang Yingda's setback was due to his loss of form, and his bad luck made him unable to recover. He was still able to cope in the first round, and the difference was limited. His performance was abnormal in the second round, which was a big surprise. Compared to Zhu Qiliang, he was only slightly inferior. Every time he shot, he lost his balance, and empty shots were seen frequently. The so-called masterpiece of opening up became his non-masterpiece. Other things are self-evident. When the first huge number of 28 points in the second round was discovered with one shot, it became 622 to 822, a difference of 200 points. When the second huge shot of 42 points was fired, the difference had exceeded 210 points. Although he gained something later, he eventually lost two or three points.

Zhu Qiliang (first round) 23, 23, 27, 29, 21, 34, 20, 25, 20, 34, 21, 24, 26 (second round) 26, 26, 51, 24, 27, 25, 39, 35.

Zhang Yingda (first round) 31, 35, 28, 20, 27, 27, (second round) 28, 42

### Xin Team Won Against Five Dragons Yesterday

Weiming was behind in the first half with 10 to 11. The scores were extremely close. The second game was between Youyou and Fufeng.

Afterwards, Xin team's Chen Xianglong, Qian Jingyong, and Feng Nianhua scored eight points in a row, leading 10 to 2, which discouraged Five Dragons' spirit. Then Five Dragons' Li Zude scored, and Xu Zhaoxiong's penalty slightly turned the tide, but Xin team scored two more goals, increasing the score to 14 to 5. Then Five Dragons' Wu Bixian scored twice, increasing the score to 9 to 18. Liu Jingfeng also chased to 10 to 20, but it was still unable to change the overall situation, and they trailed 15 to 30 in the first half. In the second half, after Xin team scored two points, Five Dragons Li and Wu also scored continuously, chasing directly to 25 to 37, with a difference of only six points. Unfortunately, after a slight oversight, Xin team took the opportunity to score eight points in a row, increasing the score to 46 to 35. The situation became even more unmanageable. After this, Five Dragons struggled, but it was difficult to reverse this misfortune, and they lost to Xin team with 99 to 37.

Foreign Wheat Soars, Flour Market Suddenly Excited

Buying Interest is Extremely Strong, Especially for This Month

Yesterday, the flour market was extremely active due to the unanimous surge in foreign wheat prices. At the beginning of the morning session, foreign quotations showed that Chicago and Canadian wheat each rose by seven or eight cents to one dollar, and Liverpool rose by two and a half pence. The market was unanimously excited. The factory side even saw the market retrieving and reorganizing this month, with no intention of loosening its grip. Therefore, the chips were particularly tight. The opening immediately soared by six cents. Although March and April were slightly looser, new transactions were eager to take advantage of them, and they also rose by three cents and seven and a half mils. New flour rose slightly less due to the factory's still hedged sales, rising by two or three cents. When the afternoon session opened, the market remained firm because customers were particularly lively this month. Next month, the market returned and sold short new flour, so it showed a situation of near weakness and distant strength. However, because the market was about to close, most people's psychology was looking forward to a red market. Therefore, transactions were not fully active, and the closing situation gradually became semi-silent. As a result, each month rose by four cents to six cents and seven and a half mils compared to the previous day.

Buying and Short Covering Occurred Together, April Wheat Rose Even More Sharply

Spot Wheat Still Lacks Formal Transactions

After the opening of the wheat market yesterday, the market was immediately buoyant due to the unanimous increase in foreign wheat prices, with American and Canadian wheat soaring by seven or eight cents to more than one dollar, and Liverpool rising by two and a half pence. Outside buyers were even more active. Because the flour market was rising, people's minds were even more upward. Flour in each month also rose unanimously. Especially in April, large households absorbed and short-covered, and the price rose sharply. Other slightly bullish positions were settled, and the market was slower. Spot wheat factory stomachs were very sluggish, and the owners were also insisting, so there were still no formal transactions.

However, a small number of people were anxious to get rid of their holdings, and the price fell slightly. The market is inevitably slightly chaotic before the big closing. There was not much correspondence between Shantou and this street. A total of 2,085 bags of Jiangxi rice, 3,000 bags of Hunan rice, 1,600 bags of Han rice, and 100 bags of Xiaojiao rice were opened for the whole day. Most of the Hunan and Han rice were brown Xian rice. The bottom of brown rice is not abundant, and people are even more hopeful.

The Source of River Rice is Turning Scarce, but the Price is Still Able to Stand

(Hu North) Recently, various inland areas have been closing, resulting in sparse sources from various roads under the river. Only the 16th and 17th are left. The go-to destination of each item in the market, each store in the early market took advantage and slightly diluted, and the market in the afternoon was lethargic. The market price of high-quality white japonica rice was weak by a few cents. Those with medium and low quality were priced high because of the scarcity of goods. The sales of Bo rice are still acceptable, and the price is fixed. The price of Yangdubu Jian is high and beautiful, and Baiyuan is tightening up. The prices of other items are fixed.

(Hu South) Yesterday, the source from each gang only arrived on the 12th and 13th, with a total of 2,500 to 2,600 shi. Although both retail and wholesale are limited, the market still looks good. If the price of thick japonica rice is raised by about one jiao and a half, the price of Bo rice will increase by a few cents to one jiao. The price of Du Yangjian rice is lacking, and there is no market. The Yuan belt is tight due to the overcast change.

### Yarn and Cotton

Most Cotton Yarn Transactions are Settled Before the Market Closes

Therefore, the Market Does Not Fluctuate Greatly

The yarn market began to rise and then fell, but the trend was peaceful and still did not escape the swirling situation. Since the standard yarn market will operate today and then reopen normally on February 15, most retail investors have straightened out their finances, so they are all sporadic transactions, and there is not much change in the market situation. However, the situation of the large households tightening the market for February is still difficult to predict.

The Standard Yarn Alone Rose This Month

At the opening of the standard yarn market, the prices in each month varied, with rises and falls mixed and trends mediocre. Transactions were not active. Because the market only has one day of business left today, and there will be several days of holidays after that, most retail investors want to straighten out their finances before the market closes to avoid danger. Therefore, most seem to be settling transactions. However, the amount absorbed by large households is still not loosening. As a result, the prices of standard yarn in each month rose by three, five, and eight cents compared to the closing price of the previous day. After the opening in the afternoon, the market situation turned softer, except for this month. According to some, the price of yarn from outside the market was sluggish, and the price of three-grade yarn was slightly lower. As a result, the price of each month fell by one, six, and nine cents compared to the closing price in the morning. However, the price in this month rose by one cent. Changfeng bought and sold in the morning and bought in the afternoon. It was found that 1,850 bales of Yu Da, 600 bales of Tong Fu, 1,000 bales of Jin Chang, 900 bales of Yi Chang, 450 bales of Zhen Da, 400 bales of Da Chang, and 450 bales of Da Qing were sold, and 2,000 bales of Yuan Yi, 450 bales of Heng Yi, 850 bales of He Xing, 700 bales of Ren Feng, 450 bales of Xie Cheng, and 950 bales of Xing Chang were bought. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices in one day are listed below.

The Selling Price of Spot Yarn is Still Flat

The sales of spot yarn are flat. It was found that a total of 521 bales were bought by various gangs throughout the day. The selling price was similar to that of the previous day. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows.

The Cotton Exchange Stopped Weighing and Short Covering Turned Up

At the Same Time, There Was Good News for American Cotton

The cotton market trended firmly, and each month saw a slight increase. Due to the closing of accounts, the American and Indian cotton markets also saw a slight rebound, and the market turned up due to floating air activities. However, the spot cotton business was quiet, and the arrivals from various roads were very scarce due to the cotton exchange stopping weighing.

The Standard Cotton Rose by Two Cents

At the opening of the standard pre-market, the prices in each month saw a slight increase, but the transactions in the market were very depressed. This was because the accounting period had arrived, and most speculators had no intention of operating, so there was little movement up or down. As a result, the prices in each month rose by five cents to one cent compared to the closing price of the previous day. After the opening in the afternoon, the market situation turned firm and rising due to floating air compensation, and it was said that there was good news for American cotton. As a result, the prices in each month rose by one cent and a half to two cents and a half compared to the closing price in the morning. It was found that Da Qing sold 1,600 dan, Yuan Yi 1,400 dan, Ju Xing 1,300 dan, Zhen Da 1,900 dan, Geng Feng 2,000 dan, Run Kang 3,100 dan, Xie Cheng 1,100 dan, Sheng Yuan 1,300 dan, Tong He 3,500 dan, and Xin Chang 1,600 dan. Chang He bought 4,000 dan, Yu Kang 1,800 dan, Da Feng 2,500 dan, He Xing 3,900 dan, Chang Feng 1,900 dan, Da Chang 1,800 dan, Fu Kang 1,200 dan, and Xin Cheng 2,000 dan, Xin Hua 1,800 dan. The highest and lowest prices in one day are listed on the left.

The Consumption of Spot Cotton is Ordinary

The stomach of spot cotton factories is not healthy. The source is 100 bales of Yao cotton and 430 bales of Tong cotton.

Buying Interest Increases When American Cotton Prices are Low

Yesterday, the American cotton market opened, and due to bad news from Liverpool, most bulls at home and abroad closed their positions overnight. The flood situation was relatively eased, and the prices in each month fell by three to nine pounds. Then, the selling pressure weakened, and when the May period fell to 12.49 cents, the trade gradually increased limit-priced purchases. New Orleans also engaged in purchases because the wheat market was strong, and the market trended firmly. New households outside the industry were at peace, and the trade waited for the progress of the automobile workers' strike. The closing was firm, and the spot price rose by five pounds, and the futures price rose by three to six pounds. The spot price of English cotton fell by six points, and the futures price fell by two points. Indian cotton initially rose due to the strength of Aumla, and the public bought it, but it turned back due to the selling of brokers and unfavorable Liverpool telegrams. The flat fruit fell by 0.75 to 1 rupee, Aumla rose by 0.75 rupee, and Bai Luoxi rose by 0.25 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 3rd).

According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast on the 4th was that Bai Luoxi was 228 rupees, Aumla was 211 rupees, and flat fruit was 182.5 rupees, all up by 1 rupee.

Attached is a Private Estimate of American Cotton

A telegram from New York on the 3rd stated that the Fan Queer Company estimates the amount of cotton fields this year to be 33,919,000 acres.

The near month was 75.2 yuan, and the far month was 77.7 yuan.

### Piece Goods

Various Parties' Interest in Entering Cotton Cloth is Lacking

The Cotton Cloth Market is Slightly Dull, Spot Cloth is Selling, and Because the Total Closing Period is Approaching, Most of the Near-Road Passenger Gangs Have Stopped Handling Goods, and the Distant Passenger Gangs and Stockists, in View of the Decline in the Yarn Market and the Thick Accumulation of Cotton Cloth, Their Interest in Entering Goods is Gradually Slackening, Resulting in a Great Reduction in Transactions, and the Market Atmosphere is Extremely Dull. Fine Cloth and Fine Twill from Dong Piece are Returning to the Factory for Half a Cent to Five Cents per Piece. Fine Cloth from this Factory is Still Firm in the Market, and Fine Twill Continues to Soften, Falling by Five Cents per Piece. Because the Price of Fine Yarn and Thread Fabrics is Firm, the Market is Still Good. The Selling Price of Foreign Yarn, Bleached Cloth, Poplin, Thread Cloth, Serge, and Other Goods is Stable. Due to the Relationship of Cushion Loans Within the Year, There is a Slight Sale at a Low Price. The Passenger's Intention is Also Thicker Than White Goods. The Futures of Plain Plain Poplin are Still Slightly Opened, and the Number of Boxes is Scattered. The Pricing is Mostly the Same as Before. 16-Pound, 14-Pound, 13-Pound, 11-Pound, and 9-Pound Coarse Cloth Futures for February, Outside the Calendar Year, Produced by Yihua, Zhentai, Shixing, and Other Factories, Have Been Bought by More Than 500 Bales From This Street and Inland Gangs.

### Securities

Public Bond Closing Shows Sudden Increase in Short Covering

Long-Term Bonds Surge by $1.80

Yesterday, the market situation at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange showed that the bulls and bears were still in a stalemate. The trend seemed quite uncertain, but the sentiment was very stable. Some large investors continued to sell, while large institutional buyers also bought actively. Both sides had strong momentum. As a result, market prices fluctuated uncertainly. Today is the last day of the week, and there might be slight squeezes due to swaps and settlements.

### Local Association Welcomes Prominent Figures From the Frontier Regions

Over one hundred people, including Gao Yuzhu, Arrive in Shanghai, Association President Du Yuesheng Delivers Welcome Speech

Yesterday afternoon at 4 pm, the Shanghai Local Association held a grand tea party at its clubhouse in the Central Exchange Building to welcome Ms. Gao Yuzhu, a representative of the southwestern border areas, and other representatives to Beijing, including Gao Yuzhu, Yu Jiecai, President Du Yuesheng, Director of the Social Bureau Pan Gongzhan, representatives from the Siam Chinese Chamber of Commerce Xu Geding, Yunnan's He Gongliang, Ms. He Jingru, and leaders from various sectors, including Zhang Shouyong, Liu Zhanen, Li Zhaohuan, Zhu Shaoping, Huang Renzhi, Lin Kanghou, Wu Yunshu, Liu Hongsheng, Chen Jicheng, Jiang Wenyu, Pan Yangyao, Xu Xiaochu, Huang Jingwan, Zhou Bangjun, Hu Xiyuan, Wang Kuisheng, Lin Kecong, Lu Lihua, Jin Guangmei, Luo Wenli, Tao Leqin, Kui Yanfang, Yu Yefeng, and others. Over one hundred young people from the border areas attended, including Qinghai students Zhang Cunchong, Chao Mingzhu, Wang Jianming, Zhou Zhongming, Li Shengchun, Ju Shengfu, Song Rende, Bai Yunsheng, Li Jipi, Wang Mingzhong, Xikang students Li Tianlong, Wang Daocheng, Ma Ze Cheng, Mai Youxiang, Mongolian students Xue Qingxi, Li Hongkui, He Yongshou, A Cunli, Gansu students Wu Yueyin, Zhao Ziming, Xu Yangjian, Song Yuchun, and others. Du Yuesheng first delivered a welcome speech, followed by reports from Ms. Gao and others on the situation of the Yi people and the border areas. Leaders from various sectors then delivered speeches in succession, followed by a group photo and refreshments. The atmosphere was enthusiastic and unprecedented.

Chairman's Speech

Chairman Du Yuesheng first delivered a welcome speech, saying, "Today, on behalf of the members of our association, I would like to express our sincere welcome to all the distinguished guests from the frontier regions. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, there have been many disturbances year after year. The Central Plains has been plagued by incessant turmoil, which has prevented us from actively implementing plans for the frontier regions. However, we are deeply aware of the fervent patriotism of our compatriots in the frontier regions, and we have never forgotten China for a single day. Shanghai, located on the eastern coast of the sea, is situated in the eastern part of the central region of the country. As an important hub for sea and land transportation, it has frequent interactions with distinguished guests from afar. The fact that so many gentlemen and ladies have come from thousands of miles away is especially encouraging and gratifying to us. Young people from Mongolia, Qinghai, and Xikang have come to Shanghai to study. Ms. Gao Yuzhu and Mr. Yu Jiecai, representatives of the Yi people and civilians from the southwestern border areas, have also traveled from the frontier regions to Shanghai. Mr. Xu Geding, representative of the Siam Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and Mr. He Gongliang from Yunnan have come east together. The gentlemen and ladies have each brought their sincere hearts of love for China, whether to diligently seek knowledge, to report on the situation in the border areas, or to develop the industry and commerce of overseas Chinese. Although the paths they have taken are different, their patriotic sentiments are the same. We, the members of our association, are delighted and honored to meet together, and we are eager to hear your wise teachings. What I would like to say is that China has a vast territory and abundant resources. To advance culture, revitalize industry, and develop transportation, the entire nation must shoulder a major mission and catch up quickly. If we do not plan for ourselves, others will plan for us. However, one of the most important points for completing this task is to popularize and instill in the people of the whole country a national concept and a national consciousness. The gentlemen and ladies come from the frontier regions, and every word and action they take will make the women of the Central Plains feel the greatness of China and the excellence of the Chinese race. Everywhere they go, they should give high opinions, so that people know the richness of the natural resources and the majesty of the mountains and rivers. Although the border areas are different from the Central Plains, they may even be better than the Central Plains. This will naturally enhance their patriotic enthusiasm. This is what I especially hope that the gentlemen and ladies will not hesitate to share and will generously impart your wisdom. The country is in difficult times, and the task is heavy and the road is long. We, the members of our association, dare not fail to encourage ourselves and to encourage each other with the gentlemen and ladies. I offer my humble best wishes for a happy future."

Speeches by Zhang and Pan

Zhang Shouyong then delivered a speech, saying, "All within the four seas are brothers. Looking at it today, this saying is correct, because it is not easy to gather together due to traffic barriers. In practice, however, all within the four seas are brothers. As for the word 'Yi', it is not derogatory. For example, my Zhejiang was also called Yi in the past. King Wen was also called a man of the Western Yi. It can be seen that Yi is not a bad word; it is a good word. Last night, Ms. Gao Yuzhu broadcasted, and today it has been seen in the newspapers, which shows that the 20 million Yi people are all of the Chinese nation. However, their culture is slightly backward. If they progress from this point, they may be even higher than Wu and Yue. However, foreigners are constantly coveting them, and it is necessary to jointly plan for improvement, establish industries, develop resources, and seek political progress. The term 'Tusi' is merely a title for officials. If, in fact, it can promote political development, it is the same as seeking welfare for the people, and there will be gradual progress in the future. As for the students who have come to Shanghai from afar to study, I hope that they will return after completing their studies and form a basic team to develop their local areas. There are also two students from Guanghua University, which is even more promising. Pan Gongzhan then delivered a speech, saying, "Those who participate in today's tea party have come from thousands of miles away to the capital and to Shanghai. Some have come to study, and some have come to petition. They are admired by the whole country, and their goals are to seek unity, reunification, and revival. For example, in terms of studying, Shanghai has a relatively high culture, and it is also close to the capital. You can see the international environment and recognize the extreme danger and the need for us to work hard. When you return to serve, you will surely achieve great success in the unification of the country. As for the representatives of the Yi people who have come here, they must have great expectations, to see our reforms and to request the government to relieve the local foreign oppression. Overseas Chinese, in addition to hoping for the strength of the government to protect overseas Chinese, we very much hope to know what your aspirations are and what you need from us. Mr. Zhang Yongni's statement that Yi is not a bad word is indeed very meaningful. When it comes to the nation, it is formed by family, clan, and race. Therefore, the Prime Minister has a special explanation for the nation. Our nation has five races: Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan. However, these are only the major races. The small races included within them are also numerous. Therefore, each race within the Chinese nation is part of our Chinese nation, without exception. Imperialists such as Japan are forcibly dividing the Manchu race and setting up a puppet state in the three northeastern provinces. This is because our country does not have a deep understanding of national consciousness. However, today, with people gathering from all over the country, I feel that the Chinese nation can survive in the world for a long time, thanks to the role of national consciousness. I deeply admire Ms. Gao Yuzhu's speech and her talks with reporters. Compared to those who are traitors, there is a world of difference. Her trip seems very ordinary, but the meaning of her trip is related to the future of the nation and the country, and it is very great. It is enough to make traitors ashamed to death and reduce the number of traitors."

Report by Ms. Gao

Gao Yuzhu said in her speech, "This time, I came to Beijing to petition and took the opportunity to visit Shanghai. People see me as the leader of the Yi and Miao people, a native emperor, but I am really a public servant. You are leaders in various industries in Shanghai, and I would like to learn from you. I am familiar with the Yi and Miao languages and have studied Chinese for two years. Today, to avoid the trouble of translation, I will speak in Mandarin. I hope you will forgive me for any shortcomings. The Yi and Miao ethnic groups are really part of the Chinese nation and have a very deep relationship with the Han people. The meaning of Yi and Miao is to be progressive and self-reliant. Today, you gentlemen have made a correct interpretation of the Yi and Miao, which shows your obedience to the Prime Minister's nationalism. As for the origin of the Yi and Miao people, after the Battle of Chi You, followed by Qin Shi Huang, they were forced to retreat to the southwestern border areas. During the time of Emperor Wu of Han, they communicated with the southwestern Yi and treated them with courtesy. Therefore, the Yi and Miao ethnic groups were very grateful and paid tribute every year. During Zhuge Liang's southern campaign, it benefited the area, and the Yi and Miao were grateful and built temples to worship him everywhere. During the time of Emperor Taizu of the Song Dynasty, there was hostility and mutual struggle. During the time of Emperor Shizu of the Yuan Dynasty, the Yi and Miao ethnic groups were divided and the Tusi system was established. However, the Yi and Miao ethnic groups still used the imperial system for their clothing. The feudal system still exists today, such as kneeling and worshiping. Because the history of the nation is longer, the conservatism is also greater. After the Xinhai Revolution, the government lost contact with the Yi and Miao people and allowed them to survive and perish on their own. Imperialists took advantage of this division and used various temptations to force the Yi and Miao ethnic groups to break away from China. Therefore, the suffering they suffered is indescribable. This time, I came to the capital to petition in order to seek national unity. When I was young, I did not know that I was Chinese. Later, after reading Chinese books, I realized that I was Chinese. The Yi and Miao people do not read Chinese characters, and their culture is backward, so they do not know that there is a country and do not know that there is China. Foreigners then forcibly divided them into what country and what country, making them uncivilized people, resulting in mutual killing. Being brave and aggressive is their nature. As a result, economic industry has not progressed. However, the mountains and rivers are obstructed, transportation is inconvenient, and the atmosphere is closed. Even if there are extremely rich mineral, medicinal, and forest resources, they do not know how to develop them and allow others to covet them, which is very regrettable. Yi and Miao politics is entirely a feudal system, divided into large Tusi and small Tusi, and there are many classes below. In addition to sticks, bows, and knives, there are also more than 100,000 new-style firearms, but they are all hidden at home and do not know how to use them for defense. This time, I have come to Shanghai and I am very willing to report the local situation and hope to get assistance. The central government is also paying great attention to our petition and plans to send people to investigate and comfort us. We will also report the central government's intentions back to the local area. Due to the inconvenience of language, I have not been able to fully express myself. I hope you will forgive me and wish you all good health."

Report by Mr. Xu

Xu Geding of the Siam Chinese Chamber of Commerce reported that he had come to discuss the issue of promoting Chinese goods in Siam, hoping to: ㊀ open a China-Siam shipping line as soon as possible; ㊁ establish branches of various banks in Siam. Next, He Jingru and He Gongliang reported on the situation in Yunnan. Yu Jiecai reported that there are four kinds of writing systems for the ethnic groups in southwest China, and the languages ​​vary slightly from place to place. The lifestyles vary depending on the location and can be roughly divided into uncivilized, semi-civilized, and fully civilized. The products also vary depending on the region. Later, Huang Jingwan suggested that students from the border areas sing folk songs from "Xikang", "Qinghai" and "Tibet" separately. Chen Jichang, a young man from Tibet, was also able to sing native songs from more than ten countries including England, France, Russia, Japan, Spain, India and Africa, which was especially praised by the guests.

Speeches by Lin and Huang

Afterwards, Mr. Lin Kanghou gave a speech, saying that today, representatives of compatriots from all over the country are gathered together, which is unprecedented. He hopes that such gatherings will be held often in the future. Shanghai is known as the economic and cultural center, but the national spirit of Shanghai is not as full and simple as that of the inland border areas. As for enjoyment, the inland and border areas are not as good as Shanghai. From a trip to Siam last year, he felt that those who were educated were much more open than those who were not educated. He most admired Mr. Huang Renzhi, who went to Siam 15 years ago and sowed the seeds of education. Although the elderly do not know Mandarin, young people under the age of 20 can communicate in the same language. Moreover, after Ms. Gao's report, he felt that internal strife was indeed weakening the country. Ms. Gao came to petition the government, but she also hopes for our help, so we should help them develop and organize groups to investigate. Finally, Huang Renzhi gave a speech, saying that today's guests have come from Qinghai, Xikang, Mongolia, Yunnan and other places, and he has also traveled to several places. He has also been exposed to miasma in the southwestern border areas. In the 31st year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, Dr. Sun Yat-sen initiated the Tongmenghui, and he joined and took on the work in Shanghai. Even his great-grandfather did not know about it. That winter, Mr. Liao Zhongkai, who had passed away, introduced four women from the Ganya Tusi of Yunnan to study in Japan, and he secretly recruited them. Because he met Ms. Gao today, he revealed this secret. It can be seen that Dr. Sun Yat-sen had great vision. Now he feels that the Three Principles of the People must be started from here. Today, we are using this gathering. Some things are done by the government, but there are also many things that society can do, such as traffic and security. Although the government handles them, we can do some small things first. He hopes that Ms. Gao will: ㊀ organize a federation of twenty-one Tusi; ㊁ each Tusi will send one or several students to Nanjing or Shanghai or other places. If they come to Shanghai and Nanjing, we will do our best to provide accommodation and assistance. This is ideological development, which is more important than any development. He hopes that students from the border areas will organize student associations, unite to avoid danger and go astray, and can communicate with each other, exchange knowledge, and introduce useful books and newspapers to the inland. Although this matter is small, it will have a small effect in three years and a big effect in ten years.

Continuing the Visit

Ms. Gao has been in the north for a long time and plans to return south by sea within a few days. Today, she plans to continue her visit. If time permits, she may visit the central area of ​​the city again. All walks of life in Shanghai greatly admire Ms. Gao for her concern for the country and her determination to improve the lives of the Yi and Miao people, and regard her as a rare leader in the border areas. It is reported that all walks of life will give her gifts to take back as souvenirs.

### Miss Gao's Standing Speech at the Local Association

### Parents' Education Research Association to Discuss Clothing Issues

Meeting to be held tomorrow afternoon at the Great China Restaurant; Discussion results to be contributed to the government.

Singaporean overseas Chinese merchant Chen Jiageng sent a telegram to the government requesting the abolition of gowns and mandarin jackets. The Ministry of Interior's Department of Etiquette and Customs has re-stipulated formal and everyday attire for men and women and will soon publish the full text to solicit opinions from the people. In light of this news, the Parents' Education Research Association of this city believes this matter is of great importance. How children's clothing should be stipulated is especially something that cannot be ignored. Therefore, it has been decided that a meeting will be held tomorrow afternoon at the Great China Restaurant to discuss this clothing issue. The specific results of the discussion will be contributed to the government for reference. According to Chen Zhengfan, a teacher from the association, Mr. Chen Jiageng's proposal will have a significant impact on the future of the nation. In 307 BC, King Zhao Wuling strengthened his state by adopting barbarian clothing and archery. In 1898, Emperor Peter the Great of Russia reformed and strengthened the country, first issuing an order to shave beards and change clothing. These are all clearly verifiable historical examples. Speaking of mandarin gowns and jackets, they are remnants of the defeated Qing Dynasty and symbols of the old era. Moreover, in practice, they waste fabric, are dull and simple, and lack artistic merit. Because of their loose and wide construction, they often affect people's spirits, making them listless and lax, lacking vigor and martial spirit. Furthermore, their inconvenience for action and work is quite obvious. Today, our country is working hard, promoting strength and might, and engaging in civic training and national service. Under these circumstances, is it still appropriate for us to retain mandarin gowns and jackets? This is certainly worth discussing at length. As for the daily life of children, games and activities are their lifeblood. If we continue to allow parents to bind their children with mandarin gowns (padded gowns, mandarin jackets, etc.), making it inconvenient for them to play and be active, what is the difference from sitting idly by while watching children's lives being cruelly destroyed and the nation's life heading towards ruin? In April of the 18th year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Education issued regulations on student uniforms, but did not stipulate anything about the clothing of preschool children or the clothing students wear at home. In addition, I personally believe that the New Life Movement emphasizes the promotion of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and these habits of propriety must be cultivated in childhood. Therefore, I advocate that we should also pay attention to and stipulate the issue of children's formal attire so that children can become accustomed to a life of propriety and righteousness, he said.

### Huikang Steamer Runs Aground Outside Wusong Port Yesterday

The Huikang, a steamer belonging to the Huitong Steamship Company of this city, weighs 1599.37 tons, is registered at 935.60 tons, is 246 feet 10 inches long, 34 feet 6 inches wide, 22 feet deep, draws 17 feet 3 inches, has 700 horsepower, and has a speed of 10 nautical miles per hour. It usually travels the Northern Ocean route, going between Shanghai, Tianjin, Yantai, and Longkou. This time, it was traveling empty from Ningbo to Shanghai, preparing to load cargo for export after arriving in Shanghai. Yesterday morning (the 4th), the Huitong steamer

arrived at the mouth of the Song River

and, for unknown reasons, ran onto a stone embankment more than six feet high. The ship immediately ran aground, with the bow high on the stone embankment. The bottom of the front hold was immediately breached, and water entered the ship. Fortunately, the ship had a double bottom, so the breach did not affect the other holds. After the incident, the shipowner telegraphed Shanghai to report to the company and request assistance. Upon receiving the report, the company immediately informed the China Ship Insurance Association to discuss rescue measures. Tang Danhua, the director of the Insurance Association, sent technician Xu Zufan to Wusong at noon to investigate. Upon returning to Shanghai, the Huitong Company had already decided to

send a ship for rescue

and hired the largest tugboat, Beiyang, from Kang Zhenji at around 1 p.m. to sail to Wusong and attempt a tow. They planned to wait for the high tide in the late afternoon, around 5 p.m., to tow the Huikang off the embankment and bring it to Shanghai for major repairs. However, when the Beiyang tugboat arrived at the Wusong stone embankment and tried its best to tow during the high tide at 5 p.m., the Huikang was stuck too high and deep on the embankment, and it was impossible to save it. At 7:30 p.m., the Beiyang tugboat, unable to rescue the ship, left Wusong and returned to Shanghai. The Huikang is still stranded on the stone embankment. The company has decided to seek another rescue plan today.

### Siamese Foreign Ministry Secretary to Visit China for Inspection

According to sources here, Chen Wentian, president of the Bangkok Guozhu Siamese Daily News, wrote that the Siamese Foreign Ministry has specially dispatched its secretary, 𠮨 Chun, to Singapore, the Philippines, Japan, and other places to inspect the country's students studying abroad. After completing the inspection, Mr. 𠮨 Chun will travel from Japan via Pingjin southward to the Beijing-Shanghai area to inspect the construction of various cities in our country.

### Our Post Office Investigates the Mailing Situation on Japanese Ships

Purchase and affix our country's stamps according to regulations. Investigations will continue as needed in the future.

According to the Central News Agency, it was reported that post offices have been established on the Shanghai Maru and Nagasaki Maru, and most of the mail collected is affixed with Japanese stamps. Yesterday morning, a Central News Agency reporter inquired about this with the local postal authorities. According to Mr. Huang Binhua, who was ordered to investigate the incident, after learning that the Japanese Ministry of Communications had established post offices on the Shanghai Maru and Nagasaki Maru, the post office sent him to board the Nagasaki Maru on the morning of the 3rd to investigate. The results of the investigation did not match the report. The establishment of these post offices does not violate our Ministry of Transportation's postal regulations and is permitted by international postal laws. The mail collected by the Japanese ship post offices is all affixed with our country's stamps according to regulations. The post offices are established solely for the convenience of passengers to mail items. The post offices stop operating when the ship arrives at port. The ship does not sell stamps. He also said that he will continue to investigate as needed in the future.

### American Maritime Strike Settles; American Liners Will Arrive in China One After Another

According to the General Manager of Dollar Steamship Lines, calculation of the journey indicates soon arrival in Shanghai.

According to the North China Daily News, Mr. Stephen, General Manager of Dollar Steamship Lines in this city, told a reporter from the North China Daily News yesterday (the 3rd) afternoon that, based on many facts received by telegram from the United States, the strike by American seamen and port workers, which has lasted for more than three months, is expected to settle today (the 4th). Therefore, several ships of the Dollar Company will set sail again the next day. Within the next few days, a total of three ships will set anchor for Shanghai. The President Hayes, which has been stranded in Honolulu since the strike began, can set anchor on Friday and arrive in Shanghai via Yokohama and Kobe on February 23. The President Hoover can set anchor from San Francisco on Saturday and arrive in Shanghai via Yokohama and Kobe on February 23. The President Wilson will set anchor from Los Angeles on February 8 and also arrive in Shanghai on February 22. The ship will set a new record by arriving in Shanghai in fourteen days, as it plans to deliver its cargo to Shanghai as quickly as possible and will not stop at other ports as usual. The Dollar Company assigned these three ships to Shanghai after the strike subsided because they are all fully loaded with cargo for Shanghai that has been delayed for several months. The President Hoover was originally scheduled to sail from San Francisco to Shanghai on October 30 of last year, but unexpectedly, the strike broke out at midnight on the 29th, so it has been stranded in San Francisco Bay until now. The Dollar Company is eager to transport the cargo carried by the ships to Shanghai and deliver it to the consignees to meet market demand. The sailing dates of other ships are currently being discussed. After the President Hoover arrives in Shanghai, it will proceed to Hong Kong and Manila as usual and return to the United States in the first week of March.

According to the Continental Daily News, if the American shipping strike can end immediately, then many giant ships will arrive in Shanghai from the United States in late February and early March.

The Ward, chartered by the U.S. government, sailed this week and is expected to arrive on March 2. In addition, several other ships will sail to Shanghai one after another.

### Raw Materials Depleted and Approaching the Lunar New Year; Silk Factories Completely Shut Down Yesterday

Must wait until spring cocoons are available before reopening; Factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang profited greatly last year

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, at the peak of the Shanghai silk factory industry in the spring of 1919, there were a total of 113 single and double palace factories.

After the spring cocoons were available last year, a total of 38 factories reopened in the four districts of Zhabei, Hongkou, Xinzha, and Nanshi. Now, due to the depletion of raw materials and the approach of the Lunar New Year, the silk reeling workers, adhering to old customs, must return to their hometowns for the New Year. As of yesterday, the factories have completely shut down.

Layoffs of Staff

Except for a few factories such as Dacheng in Zhabei, Baotai in Nanshi, and Fulun in Hongkou, which must reopen after the fifteenth day of the Lunar New Year, the remaining factories must wait until the spring cocoons are available before reopening. Therefore, all staff are laid off. For example, Yuanxing, Yongxing, Shaoxing, Fuchang, Jiyu, and more than 20 other factories are like this. The severance pay for staff is calculated based on wages, ranging from one month to four months.

Factory Profits

A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the silk industry yesterday that last year, due to the rebound in exports of Chinese silk and the domestic rural harvest, silk sales were booming. Therefore, all silk factories made substantial profits, especially Wuxi Yongtai Factory, which made the most, about 900,000 yuan. Xingye Company was second, with about 300,000 yuan. Other factories made from several thousand yuan to 100,000 yuan. However, one or two factories were unable to make a profit because they sold 期絲 at low prices.

### Jiangning Expatriates in Shanghai Pay Attention to Civil Rights in Their Hometown

Strenuously Oppose the County Magistrate Concurrently Serving as Chairman of the County Council

Jiangning Autonomous Experimental County recently established a County Council, and the charter stipulates that the Chairman of the Council is to be concurrently held by the County Magistrate. The Jiangning Six County Expatriate Association in Shanghai recently received appeals from organizations such as the Sixth District and First District Branches of the Jiangning Autonomous Experimental County, who believe that combining administrative and legislative power in one person is a strange occurrence in modern democratic countries and violates Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Moreover, the County Council Organization Law promulgated by the Central Government does not stipulate that the County Magistrate should concurrently serve as Chairman of the Council. Yesterday, they sent a quick letter to the Central Party Department, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting that they order a review and amendment, and not treat laws as child's play, lest they shame the Autonomous Experimental County.

### Securities Deposit Interest Income to be Calculated Up to the Cent; Remainder to be Handled According to Commercial Practice

The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "The Ministry of Finance's Letter No. 33318 states: Upon investigation, the calculation of income tax on interest from Category 3 securities deposits, up to the cent, with rounding down for amounts below the cent, has been stipulated in Item 2 of the 'Collection Instructions for Income Tax on Category 3 Securities Deposit Interest' and in the 'Category 3 Various Income Amount Reporting Form' previously issued and implemented. However, after investigation, interest on securities deposits and corporate bonds is deducted by the interest-paying institutions or companies from the total interest amount at a rate of 50 per mille at the time of interest payment, and the reported amounts are mostly integers. Although the amount exceeding the deposit interest and insurance amount is used to calculate income tax by household, if there are odd numbers in the remainder, they can be handled according to ordinary commercial practices. According to the actual situation of collection, there is no such situation as above. Therefore, in the revised draft of the 'Collection Instructions for Income Tax on Category 3 Securities Deposits' this time, the item 'calculation of income tax up to the cent' has been deleted, and the note column in the Income Amount Reporting Form should also be deleted accordingly. In the future, when interest-paying institutions or companies in various places calculate the income tax when ticket holders receive interest and taxpayers receive interest, they should calculate and pay according to the original commercial habits of each place, which is more convenient. In addition to notifying the Central Bank to handle it accordingly and notifying various entrusted tax collection agencies to do the same, this order is hereby issued to the Bureau, hoping that you will follow it, and promptly instruct all commercial organizations to comply with it as one, etc." This order. In addition to sending separate letters, a corresponding letter is hereby delivered, hoping that you will check it and forward it separately as necessary.

### The Chamber of Commerce Telegraphically Requests the Ministry of Finance to Abolish Hunan Province's Production and Sales Tax

The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, stating: "We have recently received a letter from the Xiangtan County Chamber of Commerce in Hunan Province, which roughly states: 'The silk fabric, medicine, and sundries industries of Xiangtan have jointly petitioned, earnestly requesting the authorities to abolish the production and sales tax, postal package tax, and surcharges that exploit the people and resemble likin. This is to alleviate the merchants' difficulties and enrich the lives of the people.' We have found that the central government's decision to abolish likin is strictly enforced, prohibiting the existence of any taxes or levies that resemble likin. This obstructs national planning, and the clear orders have been issued repeatedly. All provinces have earnestly followed these orders without daring to violate them. Hunan Province is not outside the pale of civilization and should follow the same rules. However, after the clear order to abolish likin was announced, the production and sales tax was immediately implemented. The harsh policies of the former Qing dynasty have vanished in name only. Provincial departments did not dare to do what Hunan Province's public and private sectors have done, causing the entire province to suffer from the production and sales tax for more than six years. It has become unbearable and impossible to pay. The production and sales tax is a disguised form of likin, harming merchants and the people to the extreme. There is a genuine need to unanimously request the government to abolish it as soon as possible.' In addition to submitting separate petitions, we are also writing to request your esteemed association to uphold justice and urge the government to abolish it as soon as possible." We hereby report this to your esteemed ministry for review and request you to order the Hunan provincial government to consider the people's hardships and abolish the tax immediately. This is our fervent plea. (Signed) Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China."

### A Large Number of Overseas Chinese in Japan Were Again Expelled and Returned to China Yesterday

Japan's expulsion of overseas Chinese continues unabated.

### A Young Woman's Miserable Life Due to Marrying the Wrong Person

A small table and a bed in the kitchen, she has nothing else, her husband controls her dowry, a judge personally went to inspect.

Yang Shi, aka Yang Ruiying, a young woman from Shaoxing, is 27 years old and currently lives in a small room at No. 1 Zhaoxing Lane, Dengtuo Road. At the age of 21, she married Jing Haochuan (currently 26 years old), a native of the same village and the young master of the Jing Changxiang Iron Shop at No. 2 Zhiyuan Road, Huzhou Guild Hall in Zhabei. Initially, they were very compatible, and they had two sons, the elder is six years old and the younger is four years old. However, Jing Haochuan is a dissolute young man and likes to indulge in pleasure. He secretly built a golden house to hide a mistress, leading to a lack of exclusive affection and inevitable quarrels. The couple quarreled and fought, becoming enemies. From then on, he did not return home day or night. On August 20, 1936, Yang found out the location of the mistress and reported it to the police station. The "lovebirds" were arrested and sent to the court, where they were sentenced to six months of imprisonment with a two-year reprieve. As a result, Jing Haochuan harbored deep hatred for Yang and completely ignored her from then on. Yang took her two children and lived

in a cramped kitchen room, unable to get enough to eat or wear adequate clothing. Her miserable life led her to hire lawyer Ma Lewu to file a lawsuit in the local court, requesting a divorce and asking for a living allowance of 20 yuan per month, totaling 2,400 yuan for ten years, as well as the return of her dowry. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, Judge Zhu Zhifen held a hearing. The defendant opposed all the plaintiff's requests, claiming that

all the dowry had been destroyed in the January 28th Incident. However, the plaintiff stated that the dowry was all at the concubine of the defendant's father in Qingchang Lane, Aierjin Road. To prevent the evidence from being destroyed, the judge immediately announced in court that he would personally inspect it. The judge then adjourned the court, and around noon, he, along with clerk Xiong Nianpeng and the lawyers representing both parties, took the parties concerned to

No. 57, Lane 133, Qingchang Lane, Aierjin Road. The defendant's father's concubine happened to be out, and the landlord Lu Dai Shi stated that she had moved in during the escape from the war in August of that year. The plaintiff pointed out two chests, one large cabinet, one dressing table, one Penghe table, eight tea tables and chairs, one marble-topped soup table, one clothes rack, and three leather suitcases. The official questioned Lu Dai Shi, 56 years old, and asked, "Where did the dowry come from?" She replied, "It was moved from relatives." When asked, "Where do your relatives live?" she

stammered in her reply. The official ordered her to sign, but she said, "I don't want to testify or sign because I don't know if it belongs to the plaintiff." The official then ordered that it be temporarily preserved. The official then went to No. 2 Zhiyuan Road, Jing Changxiang Iron Shop, and found nothing belonging to the plaintiff. Then they went to the kitchen room where the plaintiff lived at No. 3 Zhaoxing Lane, Dengtuo Road. There was only one bed and one table, and the two children burst into tears upon seeing their mother, which was heartbreaking. After the judge investigated and understood the situation, he ordered that the hearing be adjourned to a later date.

### A Theatrical Thief from Haimen Flees to Shanghai and is Arrested

Lu Fuliang and Zhu Shaorong, members of the Haimen gang, recently colluded with Bao Wenqing, Lu Qikang, Zhu Yinjiang, and others in the countryside of Qidong County, a neighboring county, to rob the Song and Shen families of their property at gunpoint and set fire to their houses, tying up the two families and throwing them into the fire. They were burned to death with cruel and brutal methods, which was a terrible sight. They committed many evils and ran rampant in the countryside. The county government issued an order for their strict arrest. Lu and Zhu, fearing punishment, fled to Shanghai, changed their names to Wang Xitang and Shi Dalang, pretended to be good people, and tried to avoid attention. Their accomplices, Bao Wenqing and others, also followed them. However, their plan was discovered by the county government, which sent officials to Shanghai with documents to report the situation to the Municipal Police Bureau and request assistance in their arrest. The police bureau, upon learning of the situation, dispatched a large number of detectives in a police car, along with police from the Linping Road police station, to secretly surround and arrest the bandits at their hideout at 4 AM yesterday morning, before dawn. When the detectives broke down the door and rushed in, all the bandits were fast asleep and were caught in one fell swoop. Five bandits were arrested: Lu Fuliang, Zhu Shaorong, Bao Wenqing, Lu Qikang, and Zhu Yinjiang. They were taken to the police station. After briefly questioning their names, ages, and origins, they were taken back to the general bureau by the original detectives and handed over to the detective team for strict interrogation. A detective named Yang stumbled and fell in the muddy ground when rushing into the bandits' hideout, severely injuring his left kneecap. He was later taken to Nanyang Hospital for treatment.

### The Corpse of a Prisoner Who Committed Suicide is Dissected

For medical research.

Chen Fugen, a 27-year-old prisoner from Ningbo in cell No. 15 of the Huade Road Prison, was arrested by the Xinzha Police Station on May 1, 1933, for theft and sent to the First Special Court for trial. He was sentenced to six years of imprisonment and was serving his sentence. Unexpectedly, at around 11 AM the day before, the prisoner suddenly had thoughts of ending his life and secretly used a cloth strip to hang himself. When an Indian policeman No. 151 saw him, he quickly tried to untie him, but it was too late. He died shortly after. The body was taken to the autopsy room on Philian Road. Yesterday, Prosecutor Zhang, appointed by the First Special Court, arrived at the scene and confirmed that the body was indeed Chen Fugen. At the request of the forensic doctor, he ordered the body to be handed over to the Zhenru Forensic Medicine Research Institute for dissection and examination for medical research. After the autopsy, the body was still handed over to Pushan Villa for burial.

### Wang Xiangtao Sends a Letter Pressuring for a Loan

Threatening to falsely accuse the recipient of being a communist if the loan is not granted.

Wang Xiangtao, a 44-year-old man from Hubei, used to be close to the younger brother of Chu Zhonglin, who lived at No. 19 Xinxiude Lane, Baker Road. Recently, Wang had been unemployed for a long time and was destitute in Shanghai, so he frequently sent letters to Chu asking for loans. Chu also occasionally provided assistance. On January 31st, Wang sent another letter to Chu asking for a loan of 60 yuan. However, the wording in the letter was somewhat aggressive, saying that if Chu did not agree, he would report him to the authorities and accuse him of being a communist. After receiving the letter, Chu reported it to the Xinzha Police Station. Detective Yang Fusheng, along with the Zhabei Police Bureau, went to Room 19 of the Xinmin Hotel on Xinmin Road the day before and arrested Wang Xiangtao. He was taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Li Zhishan, filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 346 of the Criminal Law and requested a postponement to verify the handwriting. Chu Zhonglin also testified to everything and requested that the defendant be released leniently in consideration of his first offense. After Judge Fu Lin briefly questioned the defendant, he ordered him to be detained and the case adjourned to February 9th for further investigation.

### The Simplified Life Insurance Compensation Benefits the People

Simplified life insurance is handled by the post office, which is stable and reliable, exempts physical examination, and has low premiums. Therefore, since its opening, subscribers have been very enthusiastic. Zheng Qianli, a Cantonese man who works at the Shanghai Consolidated Tax Bureau, has a wife and two children. In order to prevent hardship after his death, he subscribed to simplified life insurance last year, paying 1.7 yuan per month. It has only been over a year now, but he unfortunately died of illness on the 16th of last month. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau immediately paid compensation of 238.85 yuan in accordance with the regulations. The total premiums paid in the year or so were only over 20 yuan, but such a large amount of compensation can be obtained, which can be used to maintain the livelihood of his wife and children. This life insurance benefits society and is truly significant. It is hoped that the general public will join quickly, so that not only can individuals alleviate their future worries, but the entire society will also become more stable.

### Woman Huang Shuyi and Others Accused of Seducing and Abandoning

Huang instigated her nephew Chen Zongjie to seduce Liu Huiwen. After Liu Huiwen gave birth to a child, she was abandoned. The case was transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for trial.

Huang Shuyi, a woman from Fujian residing at No. 5 Xinhua Garden, Yuyuan Road (a road built beyond the concession boundary) in the western suburbs of Shanghai, and Chen Zongjie, a former staff member of the Aviation Lottery Office, were recently sued by Liu Xu Shi (37 years old), a woman from Taizhou, Zhejiang, residing at No. 66 Ximen Lane, Ximen Road, who hired lawyer Shi Zhuoren to file a criminal complaint with the First Special Court, accusing them of seduction and abandonment, and attaching a civil lawsuit for 10,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhong Qing sat in the Second Criminal Court to summon the two defendants, but they did not arrive. According to the plaintiff Liu Xu Shi, in the first month of the lunar calendar in 1935, she entrusted a fellow villager, Li Huiren, to take her 18-year-old daughter, Liu Huiwen, to her uncle Zhang Jianwu in Fujian to find a suitable match. Unexpectedly, Li did not take her daughter to Fujian, but took her to the home of the defendant Huang Shuyi to stay temporarily. Then, he forced her to work as a servant. In June or July of the same year, Huang instigated her nephew Chen Zongjie to entice her daughter Huiwen in every possible way, saying that his wife's position was still vacant and that he wanted to marry her as his wife, resulting in her being raped. On September 10th of last year, Chen sent her to the Sheng Sheng Hospital on Rue Paul Beau because she was pregnant and had reached full term, and she gave birth to a son. Unexpectedly, Chen abandoned her from then on and treated her as a stranger, forcing her daughter to return with the young child. Chen and others abandoned her after the initial affair, which constitutes the crime of seduction and abandonment under Articles 240 and 298 of the Criminal Law. In addition to requesting punishment according to the law, a civil lawsuit for 10,000 yuan is also attached. Then, according to Liu Huiwen's complaint about the process of being raped and giving birth, Judge Zhong ruled that because the location where the case occurred was on a road built beyond the concession boundary, the court had no jurisdiction and approved the plaintiff's lawyer's request to transfer the case to the Shanghai Local Court for trial.

### An Ungrateful Son Steals a Large Sum of Money and Flees, and Returns to Shanghai After Spending All the Money

The police prosecute the court for theft. The father, due to the persuasion of relatives and friends, does not want to pursue the matter further.

Chen Jiyuan, a native of Jiading, runs a Taikang Yuanji Soap Factory at No. 10, Lane 310, Tangshan Road. He has a son named Guiquan, who is now 24 years old and married. On March 7th of last year, Chen Guiquan incurred debts due to gambling and had bad intentions. He took advantage of his father's unpreparedness and stole more than 20 yuan in cash and Shanghai Bank checks and Yitai Money Exchange checks. He withdrew 1,190.8 yuan from the Shanghai Bank and 2,178 yuan from the Yitai Exchange, along with other items, worth about 4,643.85 yuan in total, and fled without a trace. Chen Jiyuan reported it to the Huishan Police Station and requested the First Special District Court to issue a warrant for his arrest. Recently, Chen Guiquan suddenly came to Shanghai from Hankou, accompanied by his relative Yang Jusheng, and returned home. Chen Jiyuan notified the Huishan Police Station, and Detective Ji Peijin was ordered to go and arrest Chen Guiquan and take him to the police station. Under questioning, Chen confessed that after stealing the money, he went to Hankou and opened a small shop. However, he suffered losses, and all the money was spent. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, stated the facts of the case and filed a lawsuit for theft under Article 320 of the Criminal Law. Because further investigation was needed, he requested a postponement. When questioned, Chen Guiquan admitted to stealing his father's property without denying it. Chen Jiyuan stated that he had been persuaded by relatives and friends and no longer wanted to pursue the matter, requesting that the case be withdrawn. Judge Pan Zhenyang, after examining the confession, ruled that the police station still needed to conduct other investigations, so he ordered that the case be adjourned for further hearing. Chen Guiquan was still returned to custody.

### The Municipal Council Reduces the Number of Rickshaws, and Rickshaw Merchants Express Opposition

The Rickshaw Industry Association will hold a general meeting on the 9th to discuss opposition and response measures.

The public rickshaws in the Public Concession had disputes before with the Municipal Council's Rickshaw Special Committee over the handling of mutual aid societies, the collection of mutual aid fees, the replacement of rickshaw styles, and the registration of rickshaw pullers, which had just been resolved. However, the Municipal Council Board of Directors has now approved the Rickshaw Special Committee's recommendation to reduce the number of rickshaws by 484 starting from February 28th of this year and has scheduled a lottery at the Wanguo Chamber of Commerce practice ground at 2 PM on February 13th to decide which ones will be reduced. Rickshaw merchants in the special district are greatly alarmed. A New News Agency reporter inquired with rickshaw merchants yesterday morning and learned that the Rickshaw Industry Association had decided not to express any opinion on the Municipal Council's reduction of rickshaws until the Municipal Council had fully explained the reasons for the reduction and its intentions. However, the Municipal Council is now disregarding public transportation and the interests of rickshaw merchants and will use a lottery method to reduce the number of rickshaws by as many as 484. The reasons for the reduction and its intentions cannot be explained. It is heard that the Rickshaw Industry Association will convene a general meeting of rickshaw merchant representatives at the City Chamber of Commerce at 9 AM on the 9th to discuss opposition and response measures.

### The Lottery for Reducing Rickshaws is Postponed

To the 20th of this month.

The Municipal Council will hold a lottery at the Wanguo Chamber of Commerce practice ground to reduce the number of public rickshaws, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. However, the date of the lottery has been changed to the 20th of this month.

### Father Dies, Concubine Gives Birth to Triplets; Son Sues for Severance of Relations

Plaintiff Claims Deceased Father Lacked Vigor; Defendant Files Counterclaim for Division of Property

Shi Xiaoyun, the brother of the local Shanghai opera and Kunqu performer Shi Xiangyun (previous reports incorrectly stated she was leaving the stage to marry a Mr. Lin), also known as Shi Qingtang, hired a lawyer to file a suit in the Civil Division of the Special Second District Court against his father's concubine, Shi Leng Feixia, alleging improper conduct and requesting a judgment severing their relationship. Yesterday morning, the court held another hearing. Both parties were represented by lawyers. The plaintiff's lawyer first stated the plaintiff's case, claiming that the plaintiff's father, Lord Shi Xikang, married the defendant Leng Feixia as a concubine more than ten years ago (Ms. Leng was formerly a prostitute in Hankou and was redeemed by Lord Xikang). After entering the family, she also learned to sing Shanghai opera and performed with troupes, and gave birth to a daughter named Lanbao, who is now twelve years old. However, after Lord Xikang passed away on the seventh day of the second month of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic [1936], Ms. Leng suddenly changed her demeanor and became pregnant. On the thirteenth day of the eleventh month of last year [1936], she went to the Sino-German Hospital to give birth and delivered triplets. Two died, and one survived. After giving birth, Ms. Leng took her valuables, jewelry, and the girl and left, and her whereabouts are currently unknown. However, the plaintiff's father, Lord Shi Xikang, was already over sixty years old and in poor health, and had long lost his ability to copulate. Clearly, the child born to Ms. Leng is not of the Shi family bloodline. He requested that the court grant the plaintiff's request and order the severance of the relationship between the defendant and her child. However, he recently learned that the child born to Ms. Leng has also passed away, and he now only requests a judgment against the defendant alone. The defendant's lawyer argued for the rejection of the plaintiff's lawsuit and filed a counterclaim against the plaintiff for the division of property, requesting approval for litigation assistance. The reason being that the child born to the defendant was indeed Lord Shi, the plaintiff's father’s. Now, because of the inheritance issue, the plaintiff drove the defendant out after his father's death. The defendant had no choice but to go to the hospital to give birth. The hospital still owes more than seventy yuan in medical expenses. Therefore, she filed a counterclaim according to the law, requesting a target of five thousand yuan. The plaintiff's lawyer also claimed that the plaintiff's father was old and sick and could no longer perform human functions. The defendant had triplets, which required a strong and vigorous person. The plaintiff can produce famous doctors as witnesses to the father's physical condition, and the plaintiff also knows the name of the defendant's lover and can declare it if necessary. Regarding the counterclaim, the plaintiff's father had no property. The defendant's lawyer also stated that the case is currently being mediated by relatives and friends of both parties, requesting a postponement of the hearing. Judge Wu Xiaoke reviewed the words and approved the postponement to allow the two parties to reconcile outside the court.

### Rickshaw Deflation Uprising; Zheng Fazhu Indicted and Summoned

Zheng Accuses Hou Shao'an and Others of Joint Fraud; Case Transferred to the First Special District Court for Trial

Zheng Fazhu, from Yancheng, Jiangbei, residing at 4410 Rue Robert, earned his living by renting out rickshaws. In the twenty-third year of the Republic [1934], the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Pullers' Committee proposed a reduction in rickshaw rental fees, leading to a deflation uprising. At the time, Zheng was suspected of instigating the uprising and was prosecuted by the police to the Special First District Court on charges of obstructing freedom. After trial, Zheng was sentenced to three months in prison. Meanwhile, rickshaw owners Hou Shao'an and 140 others appointed Gu Songmao as their representative and filed a civil suit demanding Zheng pay 30,000 yuan in damages. After the criminal court transferred the case to the civil court, the civil suit was rejected. Zheng argued that the 141 plaintiffs in the civil suit were mostly not rickshaw owners, and some were even deceased, but they were all listed, which clearly showed an intention to commit fraud. Furthermore, the loss statistics submitted by the plaintiffs were also forged. Therefore, he filed a criminal suit against Hou Shao'an and 140 others in the District Court for attempted joint fraud. The District Court ruled that the location of the crime was within the Public Concession and should be handled by the First Special District Court, and thus ruled for improper jurisdiction and transferred the case to the Special First District Court. The Special First District Court has now received the case from the District Court. The Special First District Court believed that it was necessary to first investigate the plaintiff Zheng Fazhu to understand the case and therefore, yesterday afternoon, Judge Dai Rongduo opened the Fifth Criminal Court and first summoned Zheng Fazhu to the court. After questioning the facts of the case, he ordered that the 141 defendants be summoned to court for verification at a later date.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Considers Rebuilding the Public Hospital in the 64th Term

Organizing a Special Committee

At a meeting on the second of this month, the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council resolved to approve the proposal of the Bureau of Health to organize a special committee to consider the reconstruction of the Public Hospital. The members of the committee will be appointed by the Public Hospital, the Hong'en Hospital, and the Shanghai Municipal Council, respectively. The various facilities of the hospital are too old, and some of them are impractical, making them virtually useless. Therefore, it is necessary to rebuild the hospital. According to the opinion of the hospital superintendent, the hospital site should be moved to the vacant lot opposite the Hong'en Hospital so that the two hospitals can connect and cooperate with each other. However, this is related to the funding of the Shanghai Municipal Council, because the vacant lot was originally used to build a fever hospital. Later, because the fever hospital found another site for construction on Jiaozhou Road, the original site was prepared for sale. After discussion, the Board of Directors passed the following two resolutions: ㊀ The Board of Directors believes that if there is no practical objection, the Public Hospital should be rebuilt on the original site. ㊁ A special committee should be organized to consider the issue of rebuilding the Public Hospital and the issue of future connection with the Hong'en Hospital, and to submit a report.

### Taxpayers' Association Writes to the Shanghai Municipal Council Requesting that Police Officers Not Oppress Peddlers

During the Lunar New Year, Allow Peddlers to Set Up Stalls Without Impeding Traffic

Yesterday, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council stating: "Dear Sirs, For decades, there have been over 300 peddlers selling fruits and other small items near the Beixisanshi Road and Nanjing Road areas of the Public Concession. They rely on carrying goods on their shoulders to make a living and pay license fees according to regulations. Those who violate the regulations are fined thirty cents and released. Furthermore, peddlers can temporarily set up stalls during the Lunar New Year holidays (after the tenth day of the lunar month). However, in recent years, they have been repeatedly and illegally suppressed and driven to take risks. Fortunately, those who recognized the facts spoke out righteously, and the authorities realized that the peddlers who barely make a living were allowed to survive and not be driven to stray from the right path and threaten public security. However, a few police officers abuse their authority, treat peddlers as easy targets, extort money, and arrest, report, and fine them arbitrarily. This is already oppressing the people's livelihood. The authorities are deceived, and a few police officers dare to become even more reckless. In particular, at 8:00 AM on December 28 of last year, a peddler named Huang Fugen was carrying goods when Chinese Constable No. 290 saw that the peddler's business was doing well and used his authority to demand illegal gains. The peddler had been extorted by the constable many times, and he was naturally unwilling. The constable, unable to get what he wanted, resorted to fault-finding tactics and shot the peddler in the right foot for allegedly throwing stones at him. The peddler was taken to Renji Hospital by ambulance, but he has not fully recovered. After the incident, the constable accused the peddler of resisting arrest and reported it to the police station. The Western constable arrested Huang Fugen, Shi Heqing, and Cheng Fanglin and sent them to the court, accusing the peddlers of 'obstructing others from exercising their rights' and allowing the constable to get away with 'self-defense.' Fortunately, the court understood the facts and, giving face to the Shanghai Municipal Council, sentenced Huang Fugen to 30 days of detention with a three-year reprieve, and acquitted Chen Fanglin and Shi Heqing. If the authorities truly valued the people's livelihood and discipline, they would have conducted a thorough investigation of the constable after this verdict. However, the opposite is true. Since then, the police station has been placing prison vans in the area every day, arresting any peddler they see, regardless of right or wrong, and demanding a two-yuan bail before sending them to court, contrary to past practices. Recently, a large number of Chinese and Western police officers have been dispatched to destroy all the belongings of any peddler they see. It seems that the taxpayers' annual taxes of about ten million yuan are used to hire police officers whose only task is to oppress the 300 peddlers to the point of death. We urge the authorities to understand that each peddler has a family to support and relies on this to survive. At this time of year, during the New Year holidays, they are facing such a man-made desperate situation. How can they bear it? Therefore, we are writing to your board to ask you to order the police station, for the sake of humanity, public security, and political reputation, to allow peddlers to set up stalls in accordance with the usual practice, without impeding traffic. If there are violations, they should be allowed to continue their legally permitted business after paying the old thirty cents bail. A few police officers who do not understand the facts and public opinion, such as No. 290, should be subjected to disciplinary sanctions. This matter concerns the public interest. Please investigate and handle it accordingly and reply as soon as possible. Sincerely, The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai Public Concession, to Mr. Fei, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council."

### Wuxi Fellow Villagers Association Assists Tofu Vendors

The tofu vendors who sell small squares of tofu in various parts of the city are all from Wuxi. They usually have regulations to maintain market prices. Recently, the Shanghai Restaurant and Catering Industry Workers' Union has repeatedly sent people to force the vendors to join the union. When this failed, the union presented a paper setting out a permanent agreement with the vendors, falsely claiming that they had privately formed a union. They falsely reported this to the Zhenlu Police Station, which arrested Li Jinkun and Wu Dabao, residents of Lane 28, Chongren Li, Kulun Road, Zhabei, at 2:00 AM on January 28. When the other vendors heard the news, they went to the Wuxi Association in Shanghai on Qipu Road to ask for help. The association immediately sent people to investigate and found that the matter was true. They immediately prepared a document to apply to the Shanghai Police Headquarters, requesting the release of the villagers. In addition, they petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee to discipline the Restaurant and Catering Industry Workers' Union.

### Letter to the Editor

Dear Sir, We were shocked to read the report in your newspaper's local news section on the second of this month about Hongchang Pawnshop being accused of encroaching on pledged items. Wu Yunfu pawned a diamond ring with us on December 24, 1935, "valid for eight full months." Because it was not redeemed after the expiration date, our pawnshop sold it to recover the capital. Later, Wu Yunyu forged an electric release month stamp, hoping to extort compensation. Recently, our pawnshop has filed a lawsuit with the court to investigate. Apart from awaiting resolution, the content of your newspaper's report is inconsistent with the facts. We trust that your reporting was due to incomplete information. We sincerely request that you make a correction to conform with public opinion. Sincerely, Hongchang Pawnshop, February 4, 1937.

Acknowledgment. We would like to acknowledge the generous gifts from the Commercial Press: one copy each of the Eastern Miscellany, Volume 34, Issue 3; Children's World, Volume 38, Issue 2; English Weekly, Issue 217; and Publishing Weekly, Issue 216. We would also like to thank the Bank Weekly for the generous gift of Bank Weekly, Issue 985.

### Red Sweet Potato

— Qin Wen

Three years ago, I traveled in southern Sichuan, from Jiading to Renshou, going uphill and downhill every day. The mountain scenery was ever-changing and captivating. The most spectacular was Changshan Mountain, like the tide crest in the Qiantang River, forming a long line from afar, but scattered peaks up close. I initially thought I had to climb a very steep, risky slope, but it was actually a series of valleys that needed to be traversed windingly.

The mountain roads were uneven and slippery. Leather shoes with hard soles were difficult to walk on, and one had to be careful not to fall. Straw sandals were soft and wouldn't slip, but they wore out easily. The sedan chair and bamboo sedan bearers there tied a piece of iron under their straw sandals, making a "clatter, clatter" sound as they walked. This echoed with the cries of "Rou Zuo Xia" (Tread Left Down), "Rou You Xia" (Tread Right Down), forming a kind of melodious symphony in the silent mountains.

The oxen coming and going on the road also wore straw sandals, specially made according to the shape of their hooves. They looked neat and tidy. This was obviously due to the needs of the terrain, but it also showed the local farmers' emphasis on farming and their care for livestock.

There were many coal mines on the mountains. The mule and horse drivers carrying coal blocks on their backs also carried a load of coal blocks on their shoulders. There were also many child laborers, twelve or thirteen years old, boys and girls, some barefoot, some not even wearing a small shirt, their bodies mostly naked, "Huh Xia He Xia!" also carrying coal blocks together.

In the town square, women washing clothes and grinding soybeans often had a baby tied to their backs. With each continuous hand movement, the adult's head would sway, and the baby's head would sway along with it.

When eating in a stir-fry restaurant, the owner would always shout loudly to the nearby pork stall, "Cut half a catty of meat!"

Adding garlic and stir-frying it into a full plate, having a hearty meal, totaled only about a dime or so.

What moved me most was an old woman selling red sweet potatoes. I only gave her one copper coin, already receiving four red sweet potatoes, each five or six inches long, and sat in the sedan chair.

"Sir! Sir!"

She shouted loudly and chased after me, grabbing onto the sedan chair pole. She gave me two more red sweet potatoes, also long, saying that this made up the value of two copper coins. Her forehead was full of wrinkles, her mouth pursed, very small, always smiling, very natural. I had only seen such a kind face once before, at the home of my eldest sister's old wet nurse, who was also an old farm woman from the mountains.

In such deep mountains, such simple and honest folk, had just suffered the ravages of modern weapons. When the Rongwei Battle broke out, Mata Well, Zhuyuanpu, Zhigufen, and Laimupu all became fierce battlefields. Only at Lao Jun Tai, "layered deployments" had more than twenty machine guns erected on the south side, rattling all day long. Not to mention rifles and wooden-shell guns, they also transported mortars and hand grenades, and quick-firing light cannons carried on people's backs. Charging into battle, conscripting soldiers, stray bullets flying, artillery fire shaking the sky, the casualties on both sides were over 30,000. Broken bricks and shattered tiles were everywhere, a terrible sight. I had originally gone to investigate the traces of the war.

The civilization of the new era had not yet arrived, but the newly invented killing machines had already visited, unleashing their power there. The pure and simple people had no way to resist, and could only sacrifice in vain.

Because I ate such red sweet potatoes, I often miss that old woman who refused to be in debt to others.

### I Have Also Thought

— Libo

I have also thought of writing poems on snow,

Letting the name of the poem and the white snow,

Be flawlessly pure.

I have also thought of singing in the sea,

Letting the singing soar beyond the sky with the seagulls.

I have also thought,

On a desolate cold night,

A long flute,

A zither,

A few liters of clear wine,

A few friends.

I have also thought,

A hunting lodge in the deep mountains,

Burning fallen leaves,

Boiling mountain spring water,

Picking wildflowers for longevity,

Sustaining hunger with the meat of wild beasts.

But human affairs are delayed,

Poetic heart easily ages,

Now,

All that remains,

Is endless poverty and sorrow,

Endless poverty and sorrow.

### Ludwig Appeals for Freedom

— (Correspondent Bin Fu Jie Yi)

Emil Ludwig

— Speech at the International Writers' Congress

The Fate of German Writers Today

May Be the Fate of Writers of Other Countries Tomorrow

"I am honored to be able to speak to you on behalf of the exiled German writers. Personally, I was fortunate enough to move to Switzerland thirty years ago, and due to a youthful determination, I became a Swiss citizen a long time ago. However, I am still a German writer; therefore, on an afternoon in May 1933, I also gloriously shared in a kind of cremation of my excellent companions. It is said that I occupied a position between Heine and Spinoza. I think it is more worthwhile to be buried and die between these two great Germanic geniuses than to accept the blessings of a few experts in ethnology. The works of writers you are familiar with, such as Heinrich Mann, Thomas Mann, Stefan Zweig, Remarque, Feuchtwanger, and many other famous writers, which were once the property of the German people as soon as they were published, were suddenly declared rebellious by a party in power.

Jews and communists were the largest majority of those killed and detained. Even "democratic Aryans" suffered the same fate. The famous Ossietzky, whose cause most of the world advocated to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, is now languishing in prison in the so-called Third Reich. Most of the authors we burned never wrote about politics. But dictators often think that their enemies are the deadly enemies of society. If a writer does not conform to their ideas, he is labeled a Communist! There are also many exiled Catholic writers, exiled simply because they believe in the Old Testament. If an author disagrees with the Nazi agenda, for example, disagreeing that war is a form of hygiene for the people, then there is no hope for his work to be published in Germany.

I have no right to evaluate the merits of German writers, but one thing can be certain, and that is that today, almost all German artists with world fame are either imprisoned or exiled, and none of the writers recognized by the Third Reich are known abroad. Two famous writers that the Nazis themselves were proud of, Stefan George and Oswald Spengler, both opposed the current government. Therefore, the Nazis' favor towards them was also revoked. They were two great minds who died in painful solitude.

At every meeting, many representatives claim that PEN International is not concerned with politics, and that we should only discuss our own profession. At yesterday's meeting, almost every speaker emphasized that we are not concerned with politics, yet they all talked about politics. We are often invited to wander in a spiritual paradise. Where exactly is the dividing line between literature and politics? In the past two years, the number of books published in Germany has decreased by approximately 45 percent. Is this not a purely literary issue?

For example, almost all of Goethe's works are prohibited from being used in schools. In the new German songbooks, a very popular German folk song, known throughout the world to be written by Heine, is said to be by an "anonymous writer." The German language, which in our view is the most beautiful language in the world, is now grieving.

Can an international writers' conference remain indifferent to such things? Is resisting barbarism and fighting for freedom of speech not one of the fundamental principles of our organization?

Is it possible for us gathered here to not hold the same views on war? Today, war is being prepared for in schools and universities.

They advised me not to spread the hateful word "war" here, so as not to disturb the peaceful atmosphere of our gathering. But if I can draw your attention to these things, it is only to make you understand that the fate of German writers may be your fate tomorrow, at least in Europe. From one meeting to the next, we see the number of countries under censorship increasing. If we can have another gathering before the next world war breaks out, the number of such countries will expand. Perhaps our next meeting will be forced to be held on a nameless desert island in Oceania, and perhaps future historians will call this the last spiritual refuge.

I have finally spoken, because I feel it is my duty, I should warn you, but I have another reason for speaking. If in the future, a historian writes about the International Writers' and Artists' Conference held in 1936, then he will not say that under the current danger threatening the mind and those who serve the mind, this conference did not even utter a word.

We agree with Goethe's words, he said: "Only those who fight for freedom every day deserve freedom or even life." We also agree with the words of the great Argentine author Moreno, who said: "I love dangerous freedom more than peaceful slavery."

### On Contemporary New Poetry

— Wei Dongming

Just as the "Modernist" school influenced the majority of new poetry styles four years ago, contemporary new poetry is now shrouded in another style. "Modernist" poems are sensory, impressionistic, and symbolic; this school is perceptual, concrete, and realistic. "Modernist" poems are centered on personal taste; this school is observational. "Modernist" poems are obscure and difficult to understand; this school is simple and straightforward. Browsing through contemporary poetry collections, poetry journals, magazines, and newspapers, anyone would acknowledge that this style of simple and realistic poetry is popular. Not only are printed works like this, but when I was editing two literary publications, I was surprised by the large number of poetry submissions, and most of them were simple and realistic works, even those sent from the interior. This school of poetry stands in stark contrast to "Modernist" poetry: "Modernist" poetry titles are untitled, pearl shells, at sea, dream-seeking, imaginative, bizarre, and exotic; contemporary poetry titles are abandoned children, rickshaw pullers, garbage collectors, drought, and everyday local scenery. In terms of the consistent development of new poetry, this school of poetry is precisely a reaction against "Modernist" poetry, because "Modernist" poetry had defects of being detached from reality and difficult to understand; just as "Modernist" poetry was a liberation from "Crescent Moon" poetry, and "Crescent Moon" poetry was a reform of early vernacular poetry.

In my recollection, this style of poetry began with Mr. Zang Kejia. He first published two poems that seemed to be titled "Leaf-Picking Woman" and "Furnace Woman" in the "Modern" Literary Monthly. And he has always been a strong advocate of this school of poetry. Flipping through his recent poetry collection "The Canal," which I have on hand, most of it is composed of such poems. We can even say that most of the simple and realistic poems that followed were influenced by Zang Kejia.

However, new poetry that has developed to its current state is not entirely sound or perfect. On the contrary, it should be said to be immature and one-sided; it is urgently in need of growth, correction, and enrichment.

The general requirement for poetry is to convey strong emotions to the reader and to tell the reader significant facts. Therefore, before writing a poem, poets should have a clear understanding of the importance and priorities of real-world events. This will help them choose materials. When writing, they should have strong emotions for the subject they are writing about—love, hate, sympathy, and pity—so that they have the urge to write and produce powerful poems. Therefore, the requirements for poets are passionate emotions, correct thinking, and the ability to observe with a broad, detailed, and profound perspective.

As for the current poems that depict everyday events, writing about rickshaw pullers and abandoned children, the main problem is that the themes are not significant in the era; secondly, the author does not have strong emotions for what they are writing about, but merely depicts it from an observational standpoint. Therefore, readers also do not gain anything necessary from these poems. This is like the "咏物" (object-praising) poems in old poetry or the "寫生" (life-drawing) in painting. Strictly speaking, they can only be regarded as exercises in technique, and what they give people is only one or two appropriate and beautiful sentences. It is far from enough to consider them as completed works.

Recently, new poetry seems to be flourishing. The author feels this after reading the works of many young poets. I hope that poets will not only pay attention to technical exercises and limit themselves to immediate affairs, but also pay more attention to understanding, observation, and material selection, broaden their horizons, expand their lives, and use poetry to reflect the greatest facts of the nation and the common emotions of the people.

### Winter Road

— Russian: Pushkin, Translated by Chen Junhan

In the swirling mist and gloom,

Only the moon lights the way now.

On the dreary meadow,

Pouring out gloomy light.

On the cold and desolate road,

Alone, swiftly, the carriage creeps along,

And forever ringing out loud

Its mournful, monotonous, tiny bells;

The coachman's languid little tune

Is a pleasant sound to me,

Awakening sorrow in my heart

And the unbridled joy of the past.

Ah, these snowfields and wildernesses,

No lonely fire, blackened hovel to shelter me,

But, in slow progress, only

Varied milestones marking the distance!

—— Lina, I am returning tomorrow,

By your fireside, dear friend,

Dispelling my weariness and worry,

The two look at each other without stopping.

At that time, the clock, its hands

Will smoothly circle once,

No one will linger, no one will weary us!

Midnight will not separate you and me.

—— Lina, my journey is tired and sad;

The coachman is finally dozing off without a sound;

The small bells still ring out mournfully,

The moon is dim, losing its silver light.

Random Gleanings from the Newspaper

### Thinking of Cosmetics

— Shizhe

According to reports, "Last year, the government actually repaid principal and interest on domestic and foreign debts totaling over 200 million yuan, all of which were allocated by the Ministry of Finance as scheduled." Speaking in terms of managing a household, it is a gratifying thing to have money to spend when debts are due, without letting creditors come knocking. The same should be true for governing a country.

However, the funds for repaying this debt were allocated from customs and salt tax revenues. This is like using the rent income from ancestral property to repay debts, and is not particularly remarkable. During the Franco-Prussian War, France paid an indemnity of five billion francs, an external debt worth over 800 million yuan in our legal currency. French scientist Pasteur obtained this indemnity in the laboratory because his research on brewing and medicine revived France's declining industry. Therefore, British biologist Huxley said, "Pasteur's one invention has yielded enough to repay the five billion francs of French indemnity in the Franco-Prussian War of 1871 with surplus." Since the introduction of science from the West, such as Li Ma Dou's [Matteo Ricci's] teachings, to Zhang Zhidong's theory of "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for practical application," it has not been a short time, and the money spent in the "laboratory" should not be small. However, we have not seen the emergence of even half a Pasteur to revive our declining industry and further repay a more or less portion of the foreign debt.

This hope may be too extravagant, and the responsibility may not entirely lie with our Pasteurs. Let's take a few steps back and hope that our Pasteurs in the "laboratory" quickly manufacture cosmetics such as perfumes, rouge, face powder, cold cream, and vanishing cream to meet the needs of women, so as to plug a portion of the leakage; because in the same newspaper, I also saw a statistic that Shanghai imported a total of 10,068,447 yuan of cosmetics last year.

### The Fragmented Culture

— Wu Ci

Although the Nobel Prize is a world-renowned award, the Prize Committee, which is in charge of the prize distribution, has recently run into a lot of snags, and these snags are all "Made in Germany" - first it was Chief Hitler's protest, and now it is the prohibition of German people from going to receive the award. The meaning is very clear: the Peace Prize is not given to Germans, nor to members of the German National Socialist Party, so the National Socialist Party members do not particularly covet this kind of award. In retaliation, Chief Hitler has forbidden the German people from receiving such awards.

This prohibition, although like a bolt from the blue to people who uphold culture and love peace in the world, is viewed differently. One view is the self-esteem of the National Socialist Party, because Chief Hitler firmly believes that among all the races in the world, only the colorless Aryan race is civilized, and among the Aryan race, the German National Socialist Party members are clearly in the leading position. The National Socialist Party is not only economically self-sufficient, but also spiritually. It does not need to be influenced by external sources, because its culture is purely German, purely National Socialist Party. This culture should be developed outwards rather than absorbed inwards. This is one of the reasons why it transcends all cultures and seems to be able to control world culture.

But the other view is exactly the opposite. World culture can only grow through mutual communication and mutual influence. Now, the prohibition of receiving the Nobel Prize is clearly narrow nationalism acting up. It is trying to cut itself off from the international cultural community. But why cut itself off from the international cultural community? That is because culture itself has no barriers. If it is nurtured and immersed in the international cultural community, it will not be able to maintain its purely German or purely National Socialist Party character. Since it cannot be maintained, it is afraid of "losing its culture." Even if it clearly knows that this kind of "closed-door policy" will promote cultural stagnation, it cannot be helped, because "stagnation" is ultimately much better than "changing face." This is very similar to a person with a weak constitution who knows that injections will not improve their health, but is also afraid that after the injections, they will not be able to maintain their current "weak" appearance.

The Nobel Prize's contribution to world culture is a well-known fact, and its value is also recognized by all righteous people around the world, including the members of the National Socialist Party. The Prize Committee will certainly not be discouraged by Chief Hitler's prohibition of the German people from receiving the award. On the contrary, German people, or members of the National Socialist Party, who are qualified to receive the Nobel Prize, whether in science or literature, will still be awarded it as before, because Chief Hitler only has the right to prohibit acceptance, while the right to award still seems to be in the hands of the Committee.

However, because of the prohibition, we can also see some facts in practice, which is that this is passive. If this purely German "pure"ism were the demand of their entire people, then the prohibition would be meddlesome. Now, precisely because it is not the demand of the entire people, it has to resort to prohibition. It can be seen that it is really not easy to forcibly divide culture into different domains, even the members of the National Socialist Party cannot be exceptions.

### White Poplar

— Zhu Mingxia

"Nineteen Ancient Poems": "Driving the carriage to the East Gate, gazing afar at the tombs north of the city, the white poplars rustle, the pines and cypresses spread the road." It also says: "White poplars have much sorrowful wind, rustling and grieving people to death." Reading this, one knows that the white poplar is a plant of sorrow.

Xie Zhaozhe's "Five Miscellaneous Groups" says: "In ancient times, tombs were often planted with wutong trees, the southern people mostly planted pine and cypress, and the northern people mostly planted white poplars. The white poplar is also called qingyang. Its bark is white, like the wutong tree, and its leaves resemble holly, the slightest wind strikes it, and it rustles with sound, so ancient poems say: 'White poplars have much sorrowful wind, rustling and grieving people to death!' I once stayed at the Yiguan Inn in Zouxian County, and had just gone to bed when I heard the sound of rain, which lasted all night. I was surprised, how could there be rain all night without eaves drips. Upon questioning, I saw that it was a qingyang tree. There is absolutely no such tree in the South." This section is written with great interest, but the so-called "there is absolutely no such tree in the South" seems to be inaccurate. There are quite a few white poplar trees in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Or perhaps Xie Zhaozhe was from Fujian, and it is difficult to say that there are no such trees in Fujian.

Xie Zhaozhe considers the white poplar and qingyang to be the same kind, but the "Flower Mirror" separates them: "The qingyang tree is smaller than the white poplar, its leaves resemble apricot leaves but are slightly longer and larger, its color is greenish-blue, and its trunk is also erect." We are not botanists, nor are we old gardeners, so we cannot say for sure which statement is correct.

Naturally, the white poplar itself is neither "sorrowful" nor "not sorrowful," but because it "moves without wind," there is also a mythical legend in the West:

"The cross on which Jesus was crucified was made of white poplar, so it bears the sin and eternal trembling."

Religious doctrines do not move me, but the rich imagination of the priests often makes me admire them. The story about "the trembling of the white poplar" makes us non-believers feel that some people are not as good as trees.

In my hometown, there are not many white poplar trees. The first time I saw a white poplar was when I was studying in Wuxi.

I do not know why the school authorities chose to plant white poplar trees in the campus. When I first stepped into the campus, I was surprised by the slender figures of these tower-like, peeping trees. Later, when I saw its fluttering leaves, I felt as if I had suddenly met a friend I had longed for for a long time, and I knew this was the white poplar.

The window of the dormitory faces the campus. The first night the moon was as bright as a painting. I leaned on the railing for a long time and could not sleep. The white poplar leaves were covered with dew, shining with a silvery glow in the moonlight, making me feel extremely desolate. The night wind was too sharp, so I could not stand for long, and hurriedly went to bed to sleep. In a daze, suddenly a burst of rain knocked straight into my heart. Leaning on my pillow and listening, it turned out to be the white poplars in the campus blowing in the wind. Suddenly, thousands of sorrows came to my heart, and I composed an old poem on the pillow.

"White poplar, white poplar, why are you so distressed? Why speak of sorrowful winds, morning after morning, evening after evening. It is not the white poplar speaking, the sorrowful wind comes and goes by itself, when the sorrowful wind ceases, there is only the lonely white poplar tree. I want to be the sorrowful wind, but the white poplar has no branches and leaves, I want to be the white poplar, but the sorrowful wind has no strength. Does the white poplar have no branches, does the sorrowful wind have no strength? My sorrow is in my heart, I cannot express it in words! The white poplar sounds rustling, the sorrowful wind is cold and mournful, I cannot sing, I cannot cry! The sorrowful wind knows my sorrow, secretly speaks to the white poplar, white poplar, white poplar, tell the heavens for me!"

Although this poem has no special features, at least the mood at the time can be seen from this old poem.

After coming to Shanghai, I no longer see white poplars, but every time I am awakened by the sound of rain, I always think of white poplars.

### White Russians and Banner People

— Li Xuan

In 1917, the White Russians became wanderers of the world, lost and helpless.

Huddled in the corners of Chinese metropolises, they stole, begged, ate scraps of bread, and endured the kicks of drunken foreign sailors. They were met with insults, scorn, and called "slaves of a fallen nation." The lucky ones, with their backs to the rifles of long-legged Chinese generals, went to slaughter yellow-faced Chinese, or wielded batons serving Americans, French, and other yellow people... Driving cars, guarding doors, and acting as bodyguards for all those who owned property... They might have been counts or something, but they forgot their past dignity, selling their meager labor. Still, they fantasized: one day General Peter would reclaim their vast and beloved Russian fields, the Holy Tsar Nicholas would return to his glorious palace, and they would return to their villas, reading love poems of the golden spring on parchment, holding grand banquets and balls, celebrating the restoration of their noble compatriots' national glory. Fiery reality shattered the beautiful dreams. For nineteen years, they grieved, brooded, and gnashed their teeth, hating the mad, savage traitors who had plundered their homeland. They were ashamed to see countesses hanging on the arms of Italian soldiers, screeching with laughter, and they feared hearing of princesses marrying Jewish merchants. These intertwined events of beauty and ugliness were seized upon by our writers, who wrote of their decline, their lonely old age, the struggle between life and dignity, the sorrowful illusions of wanderers, and countless tragic encounters, permeated with exoticism; the Slavic spirit, which many readers admired.

In the first year of the Republic of China, the Chinese emperor abdicated, and many three-eyed peacock-feathered, river-and-sea-robed princes lost their court beads and jade belts. Following their "master," they took down the magnificent signboard of the Qing Dynasty, no longer saying to the Han people—their slaves—"You monkey-faced bastards are sitting in the offices of our Great Qing Dynasty!"

They lamented their own incompetence, as the power of the Han people, whom they called slaves, grew stronger and stronger, forcing them to leave the great enterprise of their ancestors. Their salaries were cut off, and they realized that life was hard. Some of the children who had been raised by wet nurses sold off their family properties day by day and became petty thieves, swindlers, tomb robbers, rickshaw pullers, policemen, or other coolies. These were the princes who had been called "Master" just a few years before! The women used their looks, flesh, voices, and laughter to earn their food. In the Northeast, in ancient Beiping, how many female drummers, prostitutes, waitresses, and prostitutes who roamed at night were people whom commoners were not allowed to see a few years ago, or people who had to run to speak? Now, perhaps for a dime, you could buy their kiss and laughter. They were all so-called princesses!

Could they (men and women) not be sad? Did they not recall the beautiful dreams of their childhood? In small noodle shops, those princes who bought ten copper coins worth of pancakes, those poor

### Person in the Painting

— Manli

Although this is a painting,

the person in the painting is so dashing.

She has a mouthful of pearly teeth,

because she brushes her teeth with "131 Toothpaste."

She also adds "Five Continents Cologne" to her bathwater,

after bathing, her skin is very tender and smooth.

Her face is so beautiful,

because she uses "Yipin Xiang Xuehua" after washing her face.

She also uses "131 Hair Tonic" to style her dark hair,

so she has fragrant and lovely hair.

And from her gorgeous new makeup,

emerges the fragrant elegance of "33 Perfume."

(Note—All of the above cosmetics are carefully made by the Five Continents Pharmacy. They are sure to be welcomed as gifts for new friends.)

ones who had to wear their ancestors' clothes, the old women with their hair buns, who would never forget the Empress Dowager Cixi and what prince, receiving silver for giving birth to children, a string of past comfort and ease. But the iron chains of life did not allow them to live in memories, so they were driven to shamelessly call out on the streets: "Loose hair for foreign 'deng'er' (matches)," or to pick up rags. Their sorrow, their decline, their experiences of moving from the aristocracy to the fourth class, why hasn't anyone sketched them on paper? Isn't that also a living painting of a group of fallen people?

Many beautiful subjects are being abandoned. On the contrary, some boring romance novelists unintentionally (or maliciously) write out a few truths. I once read a section of a certain novel in the Beiping Real News, which described how a new official in the former capital during the early years of the Republic of China, when lodging with a prostitute, that prostitute dared not say that she was a bannerman, because she was afraid that the client would be disgusted and leave. How tragic this is, to sell oneself into prostitution for the sake of living and not dare to admit one's ethnicity, which can be compared to the heartbreaking situation of those Koreans in North China who are now putting on airs!

The same is true of people who have fallen from a special class, living an even more tragic and miserable life, but they have been forgotten by our writers. Is it because of the puppet Emperor Kangde? His crimes were also caused by the string-pullers behind the scenes!

Opening Chapter "Han Xin" (Mimi Collection Creation Issue)

It is lamentable that Han Xin of the Han Dynasty in the past, he was originally a poor and downcast person in the jianghu. At that time, he had not met the true master of the Han Emperor, like a dragon trapped in shallow water suffering. One day, he met an old woman who was washing cotton, and he was deeply grateful for the meal he begged for. Later, he repaid her kindness with a thousand gold. He was penniless and wandering in the streets, carrying a Dragon Spring sword on his back. He was unwilling to be ridiculed by the descendants of butchers, and he did not care that he was humiliated by crawling between legs. He joined the Han army after abandoning his pen, but unfortunately, he was not lucky enough to have the bamboo in his chest. It was because he boasted after being drunk that he almost got tied up in the market and injured his life. So, he often sneaked away in the dark, unexpectedly, Xiao He chased Han Xin on a moonlit night. Fortunately, Xiao He protected him in front of the Han Emperor, and later, he was promoted to general on the stage, which attracted the contention between the two heroes of Chu and Han. Han Xin was like a broken bamboo and defeated the overlord. He used clever tactics to destroy the Xiang army. It was all because of the hard work of the Han army, so he was granted the title of King of Chu and took command. He was once suspected of being lured in and demoted to Marquis in Huaiyin. Only because the Han Emperor was playing with money in the palace, enjoying the pleasure of the beautiful women. He only cared about the butterfly dream in the bedroom, ignoring the beautiful Jiangshan dynasty. Therefore, Han Xin was killed inside Zhongbao, and the good bow was treasured after the birds were exhausted. His past merits became a pie in the sky.

Movie

### Jewish People's National Problem Film Shanghai Screening "The Seeker of Happiness"

The Soviet film "No Nationality Tramp" explains how the Soviet Union solved the problem of the minority "Gypsies". Now, a film "The Seeker of Happiness" explains the solution to the "Jewish" problem.

At a time when Jews are suffering from the oppression of the fascists, the birth of this film is of great significance. Of course, because of its superior skills, the film has achieved great success in Europe and the United States, but its content - the content of solving the Jewish problem - is certainly the main reason.

In the Soviet Union, in Siberia in the Far East, a new Jewish country is being built—the "Jewish Autonomous Region" (Birobidzhan). Jews from all over the Soviet Union and Jews scattered around the world have moved to Birobidzhan to build their "homeland," a new society, a new life, and a happy life.

The new country of the "Chosen People" is not in Palestine, which is hostile to the Arabs and ruled by the British, but on the banks of the Heilongjiang River in Siberia.

"Seeking happiness" is human instinct, especially the characteristic of Jews, so Jews in the current society are thinking of ways to make money and live a happy life.

This film tells the story of a Jew who goes to Russia from the United States to pursue happiness. When his mother-in-law, wife, and sister-in-law find happiness, he is still wandering because his way of finding happiness is to find gold and make money. He thinks that only gold can bring happiness, and he runs into walls everywhere and cannot find happiness.

The natural scenery on the banks of the Heilongjiang River and the construction situation in the film are all very beautiful pictures.

The acting skills of the actors have been greatly praised in the United States.

### Warner Bros.' Annual Musical Extravaganza "Gold Diggers of 1937" is Playing at the Grand Theatre

The reputation of Warner Bros. was almost created by the annual musical extravaganza "Gold Diggers". We have seen their previous productions such as "Broadway Melody of 1936", "Gold Diggers in Paris", "Hollywood Hotel"... Now, their 1937 Gold Diggers - "Gold Diggers of 1937", is scheduled to meet with the people of Shanghai at the Grand Theatre from today. "Gold Diggers of 1937" still stars Dick Powell and Joan Blondell, as well as seven other stars and two hundred stunning women. The background is unprecedentedly magnificent, and the singing and dancing are unprecedentedly wonderful. In the artillery position, beauties are bombed out. On the mysterious chair, wonderful scenery is changed. It is really very good-looking. American newspapers all claim that it cannot be compared with the previous "Gold Diggers".

### Jin Cheng Screening "Beast Raiders on the Wild Island"

After the death of dog star Rin Tin Tin on the screen, it is not easy to find a successor. Recently, Hollywood discovered a wonder dog, agile and clever, which is more than Rin Tin Tin. It is named "Little Rin Tin Tin", and various training is given to it, so that it stars in the film "Beast Raiders on the Wild Island". The assistant actors include the famous god horse Rex and martial arts star Gan Li Qu Meng, etc. The plot is also written for it, tense and exciting, beyond words. "Little Rin Tin Tin" has fully displayed its natural skills. The film is twenty big books long and is now showing at the Jin Cheng Theatre. It will be shown all at once to satisfy movie fans.

### Cathay to Screen "Loyalty and Righteousness in Full"

The Cathay Theatre on Xiafei Road is said to be planning to screen the latest historical blockbuster "Lloyds of London" from 20th Century Fox, which has shocked the world's film industry, from the New Year's Day of the Abandoned Calendar. The film depicts a tragic historical fact related to Admiral Nelson, starring stars Fredric March and Madeleine Carroll, Tyrone Power, etc. The story in the film spans more than 20 years. Although the film is 12 books long and the screening time is two hours, viewers do not find it lengthy, which proves the charm of the film's history. Because the film's rental fee is extremely high, Cathay has specially followed the "A Midsummer Night's Dream" method, first holding an honorary screening at Cathay, and slightly increasing the seat price. After the honorary screening, after half a year, it will be screened in its other first-run theaters.
