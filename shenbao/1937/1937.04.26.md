### A Certain Party Is Instigating Bandit Puppet Troops, Again Showing Signs of Invading Suiyuan

The aim remains to exert pressure to maintain the puppet regime in northern Chahar. The number of Japanese traveling to Suiyuan has recently increased again.

[Beiping] A certain party is taking advantage of the Genghis Khan anniversary and simultaneously inviting princes and dukes from various Chahar-Mongol banners to hold a major conference in Huate on May 1st. A Mongolian political conference will also be held, with De Wang and others attending. Concrete discussions on the future of the situation in Chahar will take place at that time. According to general observations, although a certain party has recently been actively mobilizing and deploying bandit puppet troops, it seems unlikely that military action to invade Suiyuan will occur in the short term. Their aim remains to exert pressure to maintain their puppet regime in northern Chahar. (25th Dispatch)

[Guihua] According to reliable sources, bandit puppet troops in northern Chahar have indeed been moving westward and stockpiling large amounts of grain and supplies. However, based on inspections, this appears to be a defensive redeployment. Their true intentions are currently difficult to determine concretely. Furthermore, about one division of fresh bandit puppet troops recently departed from Shangdu. However, the bandit troops originally stationed in that county have moved eastward again. Approximately two regiments of bandit troops remain stationed in the Nanhaoqian area, with no recent increases. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)

It is said that Chairman Chiang (Kai-Shek) is currently recuperating, so he has not been summoned by telegram and will not come south for the time being. Yan is recuperating in Hebian Village due to recurring stomach problems. Regarding Shanxi Province's request for financial assistance from the central government, negotiations with the three banks to mortgage current funds have taken place once but have not yet been finalized.

They are also having puppet authorities collect large quantities of food from Zhangbei and other counties, which is being transported to areas around Shangyi and Nanhaoqian to provide relief to disaster-stricken people in the war zone and win over hearts and minds. The areas along the eastern border of Suiyuan have been calm recently. (25th Dispatch)

Refreshments and champagne were served. Zhang Daofan delivered a welcoming speech, followed by a reply from Mr. Fan. The guests and hosts parted joyfully at 7:00 PM. The welcoming speech by Mr. Zhang and the reply by Mr. Fan are recorded below. Zhang Daofan's speech was in French and is translated as follows: I am very honored today to represent the Sino-French Friendship Association of Nanjing in extending a warm welcome to the former Governor of Annam, Mr. Fan Lianni, and Mrs. Fan. Although former Governor Fan is visiting China for the first time, we have long heard of his great name. Mr. Fan's sympathy for China can be said to be friendship. Many facts can prove the friendship and efforts to promote friendship between the Chinese and French nations. China today is not what your country's poets used to praise, that is, ancient, mysterious, and difficult to understand. Because since the great revolution initiated and led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen in 1911, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has been continuing to work to complete its final stage. China is cooperating with friendly countries to maintain peace among nations, and internally is concentrating its efforts to complete modern construction in all areas. Mr. Fan's stay in China will increase his knowledge of this new China. Although some of the undertakings of the new China are still to be completed to achieve the ideal state, it is hoped that the country that established the immortal principles of the Great Revolution of 1789 will better understand the new China. I personally believe that this kind of introduction can promote mutual understanding and knowledge between us, and that the close relationship that already exists between the two great republics of China and France will be further enhanced. Mr. Fan's reply said in brief, I am very honored to be invited by you at the Sino-French Friendship Association today. I am one of the representatives of French republicanism and a friend who deeply loves China. This time I came to the East to visit the emerging China. When I return to France in the future, I will publicize everything I have seen and heard in China to the French people. All the construction that China is currently undertaking has far-sighted vision and profound perseverance. I myself have a belief that the Chinese nation will surely be a great pillar of mankind in the future. The current progress of all reform work is driven by the efforts of several people with superior intelligence. This force will surely quickly turn China into the largest democratic and peaceful country in the world, which is of great importance to the future of the entire human race. To complete this task, China must have strong unity and strength. In any aspect, there is no and will never be the slightest possibility of discord between China and France. These two democratic republics should cooperate. The reason why I came to China is to hope to enhance the long-standing friendship between France, which promotes human rights, and the Republic of China founded by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. After I return to China, I will do my best to convey to the French people the amazing and admirable facts I have seen and heard in China in the short term, and I hope that China and France will have a more practical connection. In conclusion, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek is the representative of the entire Chinese national consciousness. I would like to invite you to raise your glasses to the health of Chairman Chiang, which is to celebrate the success of the new China. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)

Travel Correspondence

### A Trip to Northern Shanxi (Part 1)

— Xu Yi-wu

Female Missionary and Old Farmer

The small passenger train on the Datong-Puzhou Railway only had six carriages, two of which were boxcars. The passenger cars were full, and the boxcars were also packed with travelers. I boarded at Taiyuan Station at nine o'clock in the morning. The waiting room was crowded, but everyone boarded in order, without pushing or shoving.

Passing Yishui: At Yixian Station, two Catholics boarded, both sitting near me. One was a Belgian female missionary, about forty years old, and the other two were female parishioners from Yixian, both around twenty. The female missionary smiled constantly, occasionally gazing at the mountain scenery outside the carriage. The female parishioners opened their Bibles and softly recited: "God! Shepherd me, lead me to the path of peace... to the paradise of Heaven, we are blind children!... We fear any human conflict, God: shepherd us!" Several railway workers squatted in a corner of the carriage, smoking their pipes, wisps of light smoke puffing from their mouths, forming white circles. An old farmer held a child of about three years old, who stared with bright little eyes, looking at the natural world outside the train, and then back at the faces of everyone in the carriage. The old farmer sat quietly, sometimes coughing a few times, touching the child's hair.

"Ah! Good child... Where are you going, old man?" the female missionary said, speaking Shanxi dialect, touching the child's hand.

"Yikou Town. Is the child alright? He's the only one... His father went to the Self-Defense Corps to get food the day before yesterday. I work all day, and there's no way to raise a child at home..."

"Then... send him to the Yixian orphanage!... Oh! God protect this good child."

"No! I'm sending him to Yikou Town to be fostered with relatives... He's my only child..."

After the old farmer spoke, he touched the child's hair, like an old ox caring for a calf. The female missionary was disappointed. She smiled silently and looked at the scenery outside the carriage again.

At four o'clock in the afternoon, we arrived at Yuanping Town. A soldier did not have a ticket. After the stationmaster told him the railway bureau's passenger regulations, he bought a supplementary ticket and didn't say anything unpleasant.

Blacksmiths of Yuanping Town

Yuanping Town is a rural area of Dingxiang County, a village of more than 1,200 households, but the coming and going of carts created exceptional noise. I stayed at an inn, and the first thing I did was inquire about a large cart to Datong. Through the innkeeper's introduction, I hired a cart driven by someone named Rourou, agreeing to a price of twelve yuan. From Yuanping Town to Datong was seven hundred li, a six-day journey, with a daily cart price of two yuan, which was already a very cheap price. There were more than a hundred shops in the town, but there were more than forty blacksmith shops. Bare-chested blacksmiths, with their strong arms, showed bulging, glistening muscles. Large hammers pounded the red-hot pig iron, sparks flying, and cries of "Huh yo, huh yo" followed. The sounds of dozens of irons striking iron rang out, "whala ding-dang," filling the whole town with tension. The turning of cart wheels, the drivers' whip cracks and shouts, wove together a chaotic scene until the sun set, and everything quieted down, as if the town had fallen into a state of sleep.

Dawn Urges Departure

The next day, the east had just begun to brighten when Rourou came to my room, urging me to get up. The innkeeper lit a vegetable oil lamp, and I packed my luggage in the dim light, leaving the warmth of the earthen bed. I ate twenty large pot pancakes. Rourou said, "Mr. Xu! The animals are ready, let's go! We'll stay in Dingxiang County today, sixty li, we'll be there in the morning, you don't even need to eat anything!"

Two old mules pulled a large cart, loaded with seven hundred jin of iron nails, three guests, and five pieces of luggage. The speed of the cart wasn't slow. Rourou walked alongside, a tall figure of five feet, with facial features similar to a Mongolian, large eyes, a large nose, high cheekbones, a square mouth, and long ears. He raised his whip, singing folk songs of northern Shanxi, sometimes shouting loudly, his voice loud and powerful.

After traveling for a while, Rourou turned to me and said, "I want to go home for a while, I don't know if that's okay with the guests!" He spoke with a strong attitude, as if he didn't care whether it was okay or not.

"Where is your home?" I said.

"In Xiahe Village, by the Hutuo River, ten li from Dingxiang County."

The Cart Driver's Home

Around eleven o'clock, we arrived at Xiahe Village. Rourou's family came out to greet us: a young woman of about twenty, a boy of seven, and an old man in his seventies. They happily helped us move our luggage. The young woman boiled water, stir-fried vegetables, and cooked rice. In a short time, she managed to do everything.

The house was a three-room courtyard, a typical farmhouse. The old man insisted on vacating the bedroom for the three of us guests, and the young woman agreed. For lunch and dinner, they prepared lavish dishes: large plates of meat, large bowls of mixed vegetables, rice, noodles, everything. I was secretly surprised: Isn't the northern Shanxi region very poor? How could Rourou's family eat these things every day? Later, I found out that his uncle had married the day before yesterday, and there were leftovers. His family couldn't bear to eat them and saved them for Rourou to eat when he came home, because he worked so hard outside.

Northern Shanxi is peaceful, the village doesn't close its doors at night, with an atmosphere of great peace. Xiahe Village is next to the Hutuo River, the riverbed is twenty zhang deep, and the water flows rapidly, with a sound like spring thunder.

On the 12th, we passed through Guoxian County and stayed at Yangmingbao. Here, there are tall and majestic watchtowers and strong walled forts. The slogan from the fifteenth year of the Republic of China is still preserved on the earthen wall outside the fort: "Peace, Struggle!" The large characters, set against the tall watchtowers, appear even more grand and majestic.

### The Eve of the Japanese General Election

— Yu

The Japanese general election is to be held within this week. The Seiyukai and Minseito parties are working together, and their momentum is strong. The left-wing Social Mass Party is also showing particular progress. (The number of candidates has increased from 29 in the previous election to 65, and the number of seats is expected to increase from 18 to 45.) The various fascist small parties under the government's protection will find it very difficult to achieve victory through legal means.

Since the situation of the general election is like this, how will the Japanese political situation evolve in the future? It is of course still very difficult to give a definite answer to this question now. However, after examining Japan's unique political structure and complex domestic situation, it is not difficult to predict the following three scenarios.

First, the government and political parties may have another temporary reconciliation. If the Hayashi Cabinet, learning from the lesson of the previous dissolution of the parliament, realizes the danger of its own future and makes slight concessions to the attacks of the political parties, the political parties may be willing to accept a compromise. Although the Seiyukai and Minseito parties may win in the election, their actual strength may not be able to immediately fight against the special forces of the military and fascist factions that hold guns. As long as the fascist oppression is not too excessive, the Seiyukai and Minseito parties are generally willing to have a truce. As for the left-wing forces, their relative increase is of course a fact, but at least for the time being, this force does not seem to have absolute decision-making power over Japan's political trends. Moreover, the general upper classes, such as elder statesmen, generally do not like to see the political situation too chaotic and tend to maintain the status quo. This is also a powerful impetus for the coordination between the government and political parties. However, it is conceivable that this kind of coordination will still not be lasting.

Second, if a compromise cannot be reached, both sides will inevitably move to extremes. When the new parliament is convened, the political parties will use their existing advantages to fiercely attack the government, and even propose a vote of no confidence. At that time, the Hayashi Cabinet will only have two options: to resign en masse or to dissolve the parliament again. According to some people's observations, the recent intensification of the Hayashi Cabinet's efforts to strengthen the fascist ruling structure, such as the establishment of the Planning Agency, the Cabinet Information Department, the Central Economic Conference, and various other plans, is enough to indicate that the Cabinet has no intention of retreating and has a tendency to dissolve the parliament again. But we believe that even if this is done, the future of the Hayashi Cabinet is still bleak. Because it is ultimately unlikely to completely eradicate the power of established political parties. Fumimaro Konoe, the leader of the Shin-Tō Club, has said, "Even if the parliament is dissolved, if the Hayashi Cabinet still uses the current election methods for the re-election, the results will hardly have major changes." From this point of view, unless the Hayashi Cabinet has other special secret weapons (such as a coup-style means), it will still be unable to maintain itself after the parliament is dissolved again.

Third, if the parliament is not dissolved, the Hayashi Cabinet will have to resign. The succeeding cabinet will of course also be difficult to produce. Because on the one hand, Saionji has to not violate the will of the military and fascist factions, and on the other hand, he cannot ignore the will of the political parties. If a person more moderate than Senjuro Hayashi is brought out, the military and fascist factions will definitely resist. Conversely, if this person is similar to Senjuro Hayashi or even more fascist, then not only will the political parties oppose it, but general public opinion may not agree either. Perhaps Saionji will go through another period of distress, and there will be a new cabinet that is superficially harmonious but actually still controlled by fascists. But this is still the same as the Hayashi Cabinet, and cannot solve the fundamental conflict between the political parties and the military and fascist factions.

In short, the Japanese political situation, which is full of contradictions, cannot find a stable way out without a thorough historical transformation. None of the above three possible scenarios is a broad and smooth road.

### The Military Will Make Important Statements After the Japanese General Election

Promoting Fundamental Reform of Administrative and Legislative Institutions; Right-Wingers Demand Automatic Dissolution of Established Political Parties

[Tokyo] It is widely rumored that the military will make important statements on the administrative and legislative institutions after the general election, forcing the Hayashi Cabinet to implement them. In terms of administration, they are still dissatisfied with the government's recent decision to establish the Planning Agency and the Central Economic Conference. The central goal of the army is to realize "advanced national defense" and actively promote the fundamental reform of the current system. For example, they advocate setting up a Ministry of Aviation, an Information Department, and a Price Control Committee in the Cabinet, and implementing new laws to improve national fitness and eliminate the dangers of class struggle. On the other hand, they want to thoroughly eliminate the various frictions and shortcomings of the current government agencies in controlling the national economy and cultural work. In this way, the national structure will be placed on a foundation closer to national socialism than before. In terms of legislation, they pay special attention to the unprecedented revision of the election law, such as reducing the number of members of the House of Representatives, extending the election period from 30 days to 60 days, and imposing more severe penalties on electors and candidates who violate age restrictions. This will allow younger people to participate in the election movement. If necessary, this kind of modification can take extraordinary measures and request the Emperor to issue an emergency edict to make it law. Eight famous extreme right-wing political groups, including the Greater Japan Youth Party, published a long declaration this morning entitled "Proclamation to the Compatriots of the Nation," which was published in the Nichinichi Shimbun, demanding that established political parties and proletarian parties dissolve themselves automatically, and urging Prime Minister Hayashi to issue a new election law immediately. This declaration can be regarded as a megaphone for the above forces. According to political observers, this plan is very likely to be implemented, and it is not just a threat to deal with parliamentary political parties. They also believe that in view of the military's purge work last year and the turmoil that occurred after last year's election, it is unlikely to be repeated in the near future. However, after the whole country expresses its support for the Seiyukai, Minseito, and proletarian parties, it is extremely difficult to predict whether the forces that want to break the status quo can resolutely establish themselves and launch a political change in some unexpected way.

### Situation of the Japanese Election Battle

Only Five Days Left Until the Voting Period; Seiyukai and Minseito Parties Can Be Confident of Victory

[Tokyo] The third phase of the Japanese general election has been more than halfway through, and the voting day is only five days away. Therefore, all political parties are doing their best to start the final battle. Judging from the current situation, there is no doubt that the Minseito Party will still occupy the position of the largest party as a result of the general election, and that the Social Mass Party will win more than 30 elected officials. As for how close the Seiyukai Party is to the Minseito Party, and what the results of the small party factions will be, it is quite difficult to predict. The prosecution authorities, in accordance with the government's opinion, seriously cracked down on incidents that violated the election law. As a result, 11 candidates were prosecuted by the authorities and resigned, and 8 candidates were forced to resign by the authorities. However, there were no incidents of legal violations by the heads of election affairs for candidates, so it can be seen that all political parties are generally implementing clean elections this time.

### Japan Actively Expands Military and Needs Iron Very Much

Integration of Japanese and Manchurian Steel Is Possible

[Tokyo] Recently, Japan's pig iron production industry has developed greatly, and the amount of iron ore it needs has increased day by day. Because the number of ships importing from abroad is not enough to enter smoothly, three companies that occupy an important position in the Japanese iron and steel industry, namely Japan Steel Pipe, Tsurumi Iron Works, and Kokura Steel Works, plan to build 20 new 5,000-ton freighters to transport the raw materials they need themselves. (25th Allied News)

[Tokyo] The issue of integrating Japanese and Manchurian iron and steel has been temporarily suspended for various reasons. However, as a result of the mediation of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Manchurian Affairs Bureau, it is gradually becoming concrete. It is reported that the following methods will be used to implement the integration of Japanese and Manchurian iron and steel: 1. Japan-Manchuria Trading Company will be the sole agency for the sale of steel and pig iron from the Showa Steel Works and Benxi Lake in Manchuria; 2. Japan Iron & Steel Co. must purchase steel and pig iron from Japan-Manchuria Trading Company; 3. The existing joint sales mechanism for pig iron will be allowed to disappear naturally; and the South Manchuria Railway Company should recover its capital in Japan.

Although the above methods will inevitably go through some twists and turns in the future, they seem to have the possibility of being realized. (25th Allied News)

### Chinese Art Exhibition Held in Paris

Opens on the 15th of Next Month

All Kinds of Rare Treasures Are Available

[Paris] The Chinese art exhibition is now scheduled to begin on May 15th in the Orangerie Museum in the Tuileries Palace. Mr. Salle, the curator of Asian art at the Louvre Museum, recently gave an interview to our correspondent on this matter, saying that the Chinese art exhibition held in London, England, last year was arranged in order of the evolutionary history of Chinese art to clarify its origins. The exhibition we are going to hold this time does not intend to imitate what that exhibition did, because our goal is to allow the people of Paris to have the opportunity to see the achievements of the ancient art of the Far East, which are not usually seen. Ceramics are one of the arts of China, and we will display rare treasures in showcases so that viewers can enjoy them to the fullest. The figures and flowers painted on these ceramics were all created by famous Chinese artists two thousand years ago. In addition to the rare treasures we have collected, there are no less than 200 pieces sent by collectors from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to be displayed. Chinese treasures from all dynasties are mostly available. In addition, most of the sculptures are Buddhist statues collected from the 5th to 10th centuries. Viewers can take this opportunity to get a glimpse of the integration and evolution of Chinese art and Indian art. (Central News Agency, Havana, 24th)

### The Situation of the Tokyo Streetcar Workers' Strike Is Deteriorating

The Metropolitan Police Department Plans to Intervene

[Tokyo] The Tokyo streetcar workers' strike has been going on for three days. The number of streetcars running today has been greatly reduced, and the situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. Because it is related to the transportation of the capital, the Metropolitan Police Department plans to intervene and is currently discussing countermeasures. (25th Allied News)

### London Bus Strike Brewing

With the King's Coronation Approaching, the Impact Will Be Very Significant

[London] The Public Transport Workers' Union of this city previously requested the implementation of a 7.5-hour workday, but the Transport Bureau refused to discuss it. The union recently decided that if the Transport Bureau insists on its original proposal, then about 30,000 bus drivers and conductors will go on strike starting at midnight on the 30th of this month. The English National Football Championship is scheduled to be held in the capital on May 1st. At that time, a large number of people from other provinces will come to visit. In addition, the date of the King's coronation is only half a month away, so if the bus strike is actually carried out, its impact will be very significant. In addition, the bus strike in the southeastern provinces has also expanded, with more than 10 counties joining it. (Central News Agency, Havana, 24th)

[Washington] The American Chamber of Commerce released its annual report on foreign trade today, stating that China's exports to the United States increased by US$10,012,000 last year, 1.57 percent more than the previous year, the highest percentage among the major Asian countries. Japan increased by $21,000,000, or 14 percent. The Philippines only increased by 1.1 percent. Although the Dutch East Indies increased by 34 percent, and French Annam even increased by 84 percent, they were all very small numbers. (24th National News)

### European Countries Owe America War Debts

The United States Is Willing to Consider Payment in Goods

[Washington] Government officials said today that if European countries propose to repay part of their war debts with goods or other services, the United States would be willing to consider it, but it must be carefully studied beforehand whether the United States can absorb these goods without harming its domestic markets and economic institutions. Officials from both the State Department and the Treasury Department said that no such proposals have been made by European countries at this time. (24th National News)

### The British Government Levies a Tax on Excess Profits

The General Federation of Industries Seeks Opinions from Various Industries

[London] The British General Federation of Industries has now asked various industry federations to state their opinions on contributions to national defense and the procedures for levying excess profits tax. The Taxation Committee of the General Federation of Industries is currently considering this matter, with a view to transmitting the carefully considered opinions of the industrial sector to Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain. The most important thing that the industrial sector is paying attention to is the need to ensure that industrial recovery is not hindered by this. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, Mr. Colville, gave a broadcast speech last night, saying that the Chancellor's request for industry and commerce to contribute to national defense funds is very fair. At present, business is booming, profits are increasing day by day, and naturally, it is directly or indirectly related to the armaments program. There is no greater way to contribute to national defense funds than the current booming profits, and this tax is only a temporary measure, and small-scale businesses with little profit will be exempted altogether. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has carefully considered the danger that this tax may hinder business development when making this plan, and it is by no means something to be taken lightly. The people of the country can rest assured. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 25th)

### Anglo-French Declaration Recognizes Belgium's Release from Locarno Obligations

Staff Agreement Remains Valid; Belgium Unwavering in Its Observance of the League of Nations Covenant

Brussels: The joint declaration by the British and French governments, which is used to announce that Belgium has been released from its obligations as a guarantor stipulated in the Locarno Treaty, was released simultaneously in the capitals of the three countries, Britain, France, and Belgium, tonight. The full text is quite brief, and its preamble states, "The Belgian government, in view of its geographical location and in view of the future situation, which still requires protracted negotiations to succeed, believes that it is necessary to clarify some aspects of its rights and obligations enjoyed and borne internationally. The British and French governments hereby declare their sympathy for Belgium's wish. In addition, Belgium has now publicly stated its determination to protect its borders against foreign aggression and to strengthen its national defense so that Belgian territory will not be used by other countries as a military base in any aspect on land, sea, or air, or as a shortcut for troops to pass through to invade third countries. Belgium has also reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to the League of Nations Covenant and the obligations arising from the Covenant. In view of this, Britain and France specifically declare that each country considers Belgium to have been released from the obligations stipulated in the Locarno Treaty and the Anglo-French-Belgian Staff Agreement of March 19, 1936. However, the obligations of mutual assistance that Britain and France bear to Belgium in accordance with the Locarno Treaty and the Staff Agreement will still be maintained." The declaration concludes by stating that the mutual commitments between Britain and France (referring to mutual assistance commitments) will not be changed as a result. Regarding the above declaration, the reply from the Belgian government merely stated that it had received the joint declaration from Britain and France, "Extremely pleased." (Central News Agency, Havana, 24th)

Brussels: After Belgium obtained the guarantee from Britain and France to jointly resist the intrusion of other countries into its territory, but released Belgium from the obligation to aid Britain and France, its post-war diplomatic and military policies will soon open a new era. The agreement reached by the three countries this time has the following three meanings: 1. The diplomatic success of King Leopold III of Belgium; 2. The complete invalidation of the Locarno Treaty; 3. The three countries can then negotiate with Italy and France to conclude an agreement to replace the Locarno Treaty. It is reported that the first step will be the meeting between Belgian Prime Minister Janson and British Foreign Secretary Eden tomorrow. (24th National News)

### English and French Political Circles Express Satisfaction

Germany Considers It Not Entirely Satisfactory

[Brussels] Following the publication of the joint declaration by England and France, observers here generally state that Belgium has resolved to remain aloof from the complex diplomatic maneuvers among the major powers. This inclination was already evident in the declaration made by King Leopold III at a cabinet meeting on October 14th of last year, advocating Belgium's return to a neutral status. The current joint declaration by England and France is a reasonable realization of Belgium's resolve. However, the King's neutrality declaration did not mean abandoning European security organizations. On the contrary, Belgium considers the establishment of the new Locarno Pact to be a matter of urgency. If Germany can guarantee Belgium's borders as England and France have done, Belgium is willing to assume a purely passive role in the new pact, meaning only a guaranteed nation, not a guarantor nation. Regarding this, German Chancellor Hitler has offered Belgium a guarantee, conditional on Belgium restoring its pre-war absolute neutrality. While Belgium desires complete freedom of action, it feels that assuming an absolutely neutral position, as Germany suggests, would impose overly rigid obligations. It would be unable to make decisions at any time, and it would conflict with the obligations stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant. This is the reason why Belgium has adopted its current stance. (Havas Agency dispatch, Central News Agency, 24th)

### England

[London] The joint declaration by England and France clearly stated that the agreements reached by the respective general staffs would remain in effect. This has been met with satisfaction by British political figures, who state that this mutual assistance arrangement is not limited to England and France. All countries participating in the Locarno Pact may join. However, some extreme isolationists believe that the current relationship between England and France is tantamount to forming an alliance, and therefore have some concerns. (Havas Agency dispatch, Central News Agency, 24th)

### France

[Paris] Following the publication of the joint declaration by England and France, observers generally expressed satisfaction, believing that the agreements between the general staffs of England and France (i.e., the agreement established on March 19, 1936, stipulating that the two countries would implement mutual assistance in the event of an invasion by another country) would be further strengthened. In addition, Belgium has solemnly promised not to allow its territory to become a base for another country to invade a third country, and has reiterated its unwavering commitment to the League of Nations Covenant. In short, its intention is to oppose bilateral pacts. All of this is grounds for satisfaction. (Havas Agency dispatch, Central News Agency, 24th)

### Germany

[Berlin] The German political and diplomatic circles are satisfied with the Anglo-French declaration releasing Belgium from its obligations under the Locarno Pact, considering it consistent with Chancellor Hitler's policies. It is claimed that King Leopold of Belgium's plan has not been fully realized. It is also claimed that the Anglo-French declaration does not explain Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant regarding unprovoked attacks, and Belgium and France have differing views on this point. Belgium demands the right to decide whether an act of aggression has occurred and whether a foreign country can use Belgian territory. Germany believes that this issue should be thoroughly clarified. It is also claimed here that Germany was the first to express its willingness to guarantee Belgium's inviolability. (National Maritime News dispatch, 24th)

[Berlin] Following the publication of the joint declaration by England and France regarding Belgium, political figures here have not expressed satisfaction. Although Belgium's neutral status has been recognized by England and France, if France were to go to war with Germany due to the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact, Belgium would not be obligated to come to France's aid in accordance with the Locarno Pact, which is a welcome development. However, Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant (i.e., the articles regarding sanctions) has not yet been clearly explained by the League of Nations, and Belgium's reaffirmation of its commitment to it is regrettable. Furthermore, England and France not only recognize the inviolability of Belgian territory, but also assume the responsibility of guaranteeing it. This is also something that German political figures are not happy to hear. (Havas Agency dispatch, Central News Agency, 25th)

### British Foreign Secretary Eden's Visit to Belgium

To Prevent Belgium From Reaching a Separate Compromise with Germany

[London] Foreign Secretary Eden is scheduled to travel to Brussels this afternoon to hold talks with the Belgian authorities. Responsible sources here have announced that the purpose of the Foreign Secretary's trip is to prevent Belgium from reaching a separate compromise with Germany, whereby Germany would guarantee the integrity of Belgian territory, or Belgium and Germany would establish a non-aggression pact. Because the Belgian government sees no prospect of establishing a new Locarno Pact, it is eager to conduct bilateral negotiations with Germany to stabilize bilateral relations. Foreign Secretary Eden will naturally advise the Belgian authorities to be satisfied with the joint declaration issued by the British and French governments yesterday. At the same time, regarding the issue of the new Locarno Pact, he will inform them that although Italy and Germany have raised objections to the views expressed by England and France, the establishment of the new pact is still possible. (Havas Agency dispatch, Central News Agency, 25th)

[Luxembourg, capital of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg] Prime Minister Bech stated yesterday at a banquet for foreign journalists that Luxembourg wishes to obtain security guarantees within the scope of the new Western European Pact and has submitted a request to the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact. Luxembourg's neutral status is a necessary condition for maintaining peace in Europe and should be preserved. We will continue to cooperate faithfully with the League of Nations. Finally, he said that small countries trust the current treaties as a means of self-preservation. Our people absolutely do not want to become the people of another country.

### Romanian-Polish Talks Conclude

No Results in Improving Relations Between Poland and Czechoslovakia; Mediation in Adjusting Relations Between Romania and Hungary is Successful

[Bucharest, capital of Romania] The talks between Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck and the Romanian authorities, which have been ongoing for two days, have largely concluded as of last night. The main result is said to be proof that the two sides have the same views on most international issues. It seems that the Romanian government's efforts to improve relations between Poland and Czechoslovakia have not yielded any results. Conversely, Polish Foreign Minister Beck's efforts to adjust current relations between Romania and Hungary have been successful. The Romanian government has agreed to consider restabilizing the situation in the Danube River region, conditional on Hungary abandoning the proposed revision of the territorial provisions contained in the Treaty of Trianon. The mutual relations between the Baltic states and the Soviet Union were also discussed at length. Foreign Minister Beck seems to have tried to explain the dangers of those countries adopting a pro-Russian policy. In addition, the two sides discussed the issue of expanding the scope of cooperation between the general staffs of the Baltic states (referring to the mutual assistance provisions contained in the 1934 Baltic Entente Treaty). It was decided that the authorities of the two countries must maintain frequent contact in the future. Finally, a tourism agreement was established, and the foundation for a new commercial agreement was laid. Colonel Beck is scheduled to begin his return trip tonight. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)

[Bucharest, capital of Romania] Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck explained last night his government's views on reforming the League of Nations. The Romanian authorities told him the views of the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente countries, namely, that the reform of the League of Nations should be limited to strengthening its power. As of this morning, Beck continued talks with Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu, and then received French Ambassador to Romania Thierry. He is scheduled to return to Warsaw this evening. At that time, an official Romanian communique will be issued, stating that the two sides have completely consistent views on various European issues. The two foreign ministers will also maintain regular contact in the future in order to develop the two countries' economic, cultural, and tourism sectors. In addition, it is reported that the Chief of Staff of the Polish Army will come here in June. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)

### Italian Newspaper Reports Austrian Social Democrats' Participation in Politics Causes Reaction in Austria

Schuschnigg Issues Statement Domestically, Determined Not to Allow Other Countries to Interfere in Internal Affairs

[London] The news published yesterday by the Italian semi-official newspaper "Italian Daily" that the Austrian National Socialist Party will participate in Austrian politics has caused an unpleasant impression in Austria. It is reported that the Italian government has notified the Austrian government that the news in the Italian Daily is the personal view of the newspaper's chairman, Gayda, and has not been endorsed by the Italian Foreign Ministry. (Central News Agency dispatch, 24th)

[Vienna] Regarding the news published yesterday by the "Italian Daily" that the Austrian National Socialist Party will participate in Austrian politics, the Austrian semi-official newspaper "Political Correspondence" published an article by Prime Minister Schuschnigg, personally making a statement. It was very long. Here is an excerpt of the main points: Italy has never interfered in Austria's internal affairs. Therefore, the news in the "Italian Daily" has nothing to do with the talks conducted by the Italian and Austrian authorities in the port of Venice." Regarding the Italian Daily's claim that the National Socialist Party will participate in the Austrian Patriotic Front" (i.e., the Austrian government party), Schuschnigg said that when he gave a speech on February 14th of this year, he had said that the Patriotic Front should communicate with the extreme nationalists," but it is up to him to personally choose which of the extreme nationalists can communicate and which he fully trusts. The same principle will also be applied to former Social Democratic Party members. However, Austria's current administrative system is not a coalition cabinet of various parties. Therefore, the idea of the National Socialist Party participating in Austrian politics has never been discussed. The Prime Minister concluded by saying that the basic principle of Austria's foreign policy is not to allow relative political blocs." The Rome Protocols are the foundation of Austria's independence and must be resolutely observed. As for the agreement established between Germany and Austria on July 11th of last year, it concerns the interests of the entire German nation, and Austria must also faithfully observe it.

### German Newspapers Severely Criticize British Merchant Ships Transporting Grain to Spain

Accusing the British Navy of Deliberately Interfering in the Spanish Civil War

[London] Since the successful transport of grain to Spain by British merchant ships, German newspapers have launched fierce attacks on England because the British Navy protected the merchant ships, enabling them to break through the blockade line of the Spanish Nationalist Army. German newspapers accuse the British Navy of deliberately interfering in the Spanish war and claim that the British government's action was due to being pressured by Parliament and succumbing to the anti-government faction, as Parliament is filled with people sympathetic to the Communists. Furthermore, since the successful voyage of three ships to Spain a few days ago, five more British merchant ships are preparing to transport grain to Spain. Two of them, the "Stedsholt" and the "Selstone," departed this morning from the French port of La Pallice for Basque cities. The other three, the "Thorpehall," "Sheaf Field," and "Malvina," are waiting for an opportunity in the southern French port of Saint-Jean-de-Luz and will soon set sail. The British 42,000-ton battleship "Hotspur" has arrived at La Pallice and is preparing to return to England to participate in the naval review for the coronation. At the same time, the "Shropshire" has been ordered to set sail, presumably for the Spanish coast. (Reuters dispatch, Central News Agency, 25th)

### Mexico Sends Warships to Escort Merchant Ships Transporting Grain

Madrid and Barcelona radio stations announced that the Mexican government will send the warship "Durango" to Spanish waters to escort Mexican merchant ships transporting grain to supply workers in the areas controlled by the Spanish government. It is claimed that Mexico has the freedom to take this action because it has not signed the International Non-Intervention Agreement. (National Maritime News dispatch, 25th)

### Sino-British Boundary Commission Members Hold Meetings for Days

Meeting Location Now Moved to Mengsuo; Border Residents Warmly Welcome Our Commissioners

[Cang County Correspondence] The Sino-British Joint Survey Committee for the southern section of the Yunnan-Burma boundary has been meeting for over a month since the meetings began on January 2nd of this year. It is now learned that the Chinese commissioners' office has moved to Mengsuo along with the British side to continue the meetings, and that they are inspecting the mountains and land. It is said that the committee work has been intense in recent days. Except for Sundays, they meet or inspect the land daily without interruption. As for the contents of the meetings, they cannot be disclosed because they have not been concluded, so it is impossible to find out the details. However, it is generally to examine important witnesses in order to prove which country has jurisdiction over the undetermined boundary area. It is said that this procedure is the so-called "second responsibility" in Article 3 of the committee's mission outline, which is based on on-site inspections to report to the governments concerned for consideration.

The relocation of the Chinese and British commissioners to Mengsuo, which is under the jurisdiction of the seventh district of Lancang County, is close to Burma. It is a flat dam, with beautiful mountains and clear waters, and excellent scenery. There are three villages, all inhabited by hundreds of families of the Baiyi ethnic group, which can be called a prosperous place in the border area. In addition, it is close to the tropics, only over 3,000 feet above sea level, with temperatures of over 50 degrees in the morning and rising to 80 to 90 degrees at noon, which is much warmer than the previous location, Lao Chang. Therefore, the vegetation is lush and evergreen throughout the year. The irrigation is crisscrossed by waterways, and the water conservancy is very good. Moreover, the nearby roads are wide, and the place is peaceful. This should be attributed to the achievements of Li Wenxin, the county magistrate of the county. Magistrate Li is usually honest and frugal, and wears the gray cloth clothes worn by soldiers. Strangers do not know that he is the county magistrate. In recent years, he has worked hard on construction projects. Once you enter his jurisdiction, you can say that there is no road that is not flat. Even the difficult mountain slopes are wide and tidy, which can be regarded as the initial stage of rebuilding automobile roads. This is the most obvious sign of good county administration. It is also reported that Zhang Dingxin, the head of the seventh district, is full of national and ethnic ideas and is hardworking in governing affairs. He is loved and supported by the border residents. This time, he followed our office to take care of everything and was very enthusiastic.

Our Camp

The Mengsuo camp is spacious and easy to arrange. In addition, there have been two previous camp construction experiences in this area, so there have been many improvements in various aspects of the arrangement. Here is a general record of it, such as using bamboo pipes to draw clean water from the mountains for drinking water. The convenience and cleanliness are like running water, and it is also introduced into the bathroom. Many employees take cold water baths here. The toilets are army-style, partially excavated and buried daily, which is also very hygienic. Other things, such as the cleanliness of the dining hall and the orderly arrangement of the tents, are all well-organized. Moreover, special attention is paid to discipline in this area. Because there are many guards, muleteers, and other people, and the workers in the nearby villages have always been timid and afraid of strangers, Liang and Zhang, the two commissioners, issued a notice on the second day of their arrival and camp construction, strictly prohibiting free entry into nearby villages to avoid disturbing the people, and issued purchase permits attached to the arms before allowing people to enter the village to shop. At the same time, personnel were dispatched to inspect and supervise closely. Therefore, the nearby villagers were not alarmed, and they competed to sell local products, and the mountain people from afar flocked to them, with a large number of people. In addition, the medical team in the area held daily clinics and gave medicines to help the border residents who had no medicine or doctors. As a result, the villagers gathered, creating a scene as bustling as a marketplace. From this, it can be seen that the natives also have considerable faith in the new medical techniques.

Bull Fighting Ceremony

This time, the border people warmly welcomed our commissioners because they felt that the joint survey by our commissioners and the British side was closely related to them. On January 20th, they held a bull fighting ceremony in the large open space to the left of our camp. This bull fighting is the most solemn and sincere ceremony for the border people, used to salute officials, worship heaven and earth spirits, and to signify eternal obedience. On that day, our commissioners first obtained the request of the people and agreed to accept their kindness. At the same time, they sent people to make arrangements and temporarily dispatched guards to protect the area. At 1:00 p.m., people from all sides gathered, including the Baiyi, Luohei, and Kawa ethnic groups, and organized several dance teams, each led by the national flag, marching in formation with drums and trumpets. After arriving at the venue, each team immediately erected the national flag in the center, forming a circle, and began to dance. The national flag and the "bare-chested tattoos" of the border people were in striking contrast. For a time, various unique performances of various ethnic groups were presented under the portrait of the General Manager. The extremely large venue was almost completely surrounded. The dancers danced more and more enthusiastically, mixed with loud songs, drum music, and drawing swords and waving them, as if drunk and crazy. According to archaeologists, this kind of dance originated from motivating soldiers during wartime and celebrating after a triumphant return. Their martial and valiant spirit can be imagined. Then, Liang and Zhang, the two commissioners, gave encouragement and bestowed wine and food. There was a burst of cheers, and they were even more respectful of our commissioners. They unanimously thanked them. After that, there was a bull fighting ceremony, performed by the chief of the Kawa ethnic group. First, he used a bowl of wine, in front of the bull, and prayed for a long time, and made an oath to the sky, the general meaning being that he would always belong to China and would never betray it. After the prayer was over, another chief stabbed the bull in the right side, which was probably the heart of the bull. After a while, the bull fell to the ground. The word "sacrifice" fits this meaning, which comes from very ancient Chinese customs. On that day, everyone dispersed in joy until the red sun was about to set, which shows that the border people's love for the motherland and support for the "Han officials" is purely sincere, and the situation is no less than that in the inland areas. (Note: "The border people mostly tattoo their bodies with various patterns, and often bare their upper bodies, considering it beautiful, which is bare-chested tattoos." The border people call our officials "Han officials", using the Baiyi pronunciation like "Gong Kun", call foreigners "Ge La", and foreign officials "Gong Ge La")

Border People's Feelings

The ethnic groups in the border area are the most complex, some say there are more than forty kinds, but most of them were naturalized into China since the Ming Dynasty. After the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, they were all granted titles as native officials, serving as barriers to the territory. These ethnic groups all regard the granting of titles as a great honor. To this day, they still regard the seals issued in the past as the most important thing. Even though it is now under the rule of the Republic of China, they still seal and worship every New Year's Day, and are diligent and undaunted. It can be seen that their Jing Huai originates from this source, and does not decrease with the changes of the times.

### Kunshan

Inspect Measuring Instruments

Our county has been promoting new measuring instruments for three years. After a long period of use, it is feared that the stamped inspection marks may be blurred and unclear, and that there are still many instruments that do not meet the standards. The county government has now sent personnel to various townships and towns starting from the 24th, to carry out inspections from door to door in conjunction with the police to add stamps. Those who refuse to comply will be punished according to regulations. It is reported that this inspection work will be completed by the end of June.

### Wuxi

Embezzlement by Land Administration Bureau Officials

Our county's Land Administration Bureau, since the 7th of this month, has been ordered to return the interest collected to the property owners. More than 10,000 yuan has been issued. However, the Provincial Land Administration Bureau recently sent personnel to Wuxi to secretly investigate the Land Administration Bureau, and found that most of the receipts for the collection of interest and the stubs did not match. It is clear that the bureau's officials are embezzling. It was also discovered that the person in charge of collecting this interest was Zhang Qiyi, the fee collector of the bureau's land price declaration office. Zhang is the brother-in-law of Hu Pinfang, the director of the bureau. The investigator from the provincial bureau placed Zhang under surveillance, and then returned to the province to report. The director of the Provincial Land Administration Bureau then secretly ordered Director Hu the day before yesterday to personally send Zhang Qiyi, who was involved in the embezzlement, to the provincial hall to await legal proceedings. After receiving the order, Hu took a guard and escorted Zhang Qiyi to the province by car yesterday to await verification and handling. However, it is said that Hu has absconded and his whereabouts are unknown. It is reported that the province has decided to dismiss Hu and has appointed Ding Songlin to come to Wuxi to take over. Ding is scheduled to come to Wuxi on the 26th. Yang Zhiping, a resident of Xixitou, a residential area in the west of the city, requested the Land Administration Bureau to transfer and register land in July of last year. The bureau suddenly imposed a double fee. He hired a lawyer the day before yesterday to accuse Director Hu of dereliction of duty in the local court. The criminal court, according to the complaint, immediately issued a summons by Judge Zhang Xianxin yesterday to hear Yang. Director Hu did not arrive. It was ordered to wait for Hu to be summoned to the case before proceeding with verification and handling.

The Jiashan County Government held an exhibition of national defense education achievements. The opening ceremony was held yesterday. Su-Zhe Border Area Director Zhang Fakui was invited to attend and give instructions. Mr. Zhang arrived in Jiashan at the station yesterday morning. In addition to County Magistrate Yu Shuluan and Kong, the commander of the Second Regiment of the 56th Division, there were also about 10,000 people from county party, institutions, legal groups, and schools. After Mr. Zhang got out of the car, he took a rickshaw into the city. Those who came with him included Gao Naitong, director of the Provincial Jiaxing People's Education Center, Zhu Xuanri, staff officer, Liu Heding, commander of the 36th Army, and Zhao Yuren, inspector of the Education Department. The entourage was very simple. After Mr. Zhang arrived at the county government, he participated in the opening ceremony of the exhibition, and gave instructions to the county government staff, representatives of various agencies and legal groups. Then he visited the exhibition, inspected the party and government agencies, and at the army drill ground in the west gate, concentrated the provincial security team, the strongmen's team, the police brigade, the volunteer police, and the water and land police to carry out a large review. He returned to He in the evening.

### Jiaxing

Telegraph Request to Release Gu Suming

Gu Suming, chairman of the Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce, was implicated in the Yin Zaiwei case this time, and was summoned to Nanjing Garrison Headquarters a few days ago to remain in Beijing for questioning. The various trade associations in Jiaxing, believing that Gu is a law-abiding citizen with no misconduct, jointly telegraphed the Garrison Headquarters to approve his release. The County Chamber of Commerce also briefly informed the Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce to telegraph the release. The Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce telegraphed Beijing the day before yesterday to guarantee it and requested approval for bail to avoid being implicated.

### Hangzhou

Handling Exemption of Land Tax

In Zhejiang Province, land has been requisitioned for the construction of highways and railways for many years. Most of them have been exempted from grain tax, but many of those completed later have not been processed. The provincial government has formulated measures to complete the processing by the end of April. Due to the complicated procedures, it is actually impossible to complete it by the end of the month as scheduled. According to recent statistics, 30 counties, including Shaoxing, have reported complete exemption from grain tax to the province, and the remaining counties have not reported. According to the Department of Finance, from the Republic of China 21 to the recent past, the Ministry of Finance has approved the exemption of land tax for the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Road area of 916.233 mu, the amount of land tax exempted was 1,899.163 yuan in the upper period and 1,061.58 yuan in the lower period; the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road area was 4,040.853 mu, the amount of land tax exempted was 1,036.534 yuan in the upper period and 109.780 yuan in the lower period; the area of highways in each county was 11,756.343 mu, the amount of land tax exempted was 1,933.967 yuan in the upper period and 416.298 yuan in the lower period.

### Remnants of the Yunnan Journey (5)

— by Beicheng

The tenth day (April 14th), in Changsha, the whole group split into five groups for investigation. Some went to the zinc smelting factory, and some went to inspect Shuilu Island. Shuilu Island is an island in the Xiang River, not connected to either bank. Crossing the river requires two trips. The island is the location of the Jianglun Wharf and factories, making it a bustling market. The details of everything in Changsha are recorded in detail in the "Hunan Yearbook of the 25th Year of the Republic of China." Also, the newly compiled "Summary of the Xiang Territory Along the Jingkun Highway" by the provincial reception office is very rich, with as many as fifty-nine photos. At noon, we accepted the invitation of colleagues from the Changsha newspaper and had lunch at Qian Yegong's residence. The hosts, Mr. Luo and Mr. Chen, gathered signature dishes from various restaurants to entertain the guests.

The menu is as follows:

Xu Changxing: Roasted Duck, Duck Pancreas
Liu Defang: Tangyuan (Sweet Rice Balls)
Li Hesheng: Baiye (Tofu Sheets), Beef Tripe
Qingxi Pavilion: Noodles
Liu Chef: Dried Shredded Tofu
Cao Chef: Shark Fin (Chef from Tan Yankai's household)
Xingyuan: Turtle Meat, Frog Meat, Bull Penis
Yuloudong: Soup-Soaked Tripe (Where Ye Dehui used to get drunk)
Aiyating: Rice Noodles

Although not all were fully prepared on that day, there were several varieties. My wife is now supplementing them.

At Shen Shi (3-5 PM), Chairman He Yunqiao invited us to his private residence for a conversation. Mr. He had attended a banquet hosted by the British fleet commander at noon and had drunk a bit too much. He was resting at his residence and came out a little late. Once he came out, we discussed all kinds of facilities. Most of them can be found in the yearbook, so there is no need to repeat them. However, regarding the reorganization of the security forces into a new system, the entire province has recently been reduced to twenty-one teams, with a budget of 4.1 million yuan. In addition, the income from the Hunan highway, after expenses, still has a surplus of more than 100,000 yuan per month, and there is an annual road maintenance fee of 300,000 yuan for maintenance needs. Therefore, the road surface of the entire province is clean and tidy, which is not as good as Anhui and Jiangxi. Hunan Province has an annual revenue of 17 million yuan, with balanced income and expenditure. The previous debt of the province was tens of millions, which was advanced by the central government during the bandit suppression period. It still needs to pay 5 million yuan in debt interest every year, it is said. In the evening, some went to Xiangtan to inspect the Jingxiang Railway Bridge, and some went to tour the city streets. Changsha's urban area is a production-oriented society. Although the cost of living is high, it is still manageable. There are more than 400 registered prostitutes, and more than 1,000 unregistered ones. Some inspected the model prison, and saw the former Liuyang County Magistrate Gu Fei in custody, looking ashamed and covering his face with his hands. Because Gu had compromised with the communists when they entered the city and had helped them requisition supplies, he was given an extremely long sentence as a traitor.

The eleventh day (April 15th) was still in Changsha. In the morning, we watched the centralized training of middle school students. The director, Shi Zefan, was a graduate of the Japanese military academy. He is the son of Shi Congbin, and the elder brother of Shi Jianqiao, who assassinated Sun Chuanfang. Middle school students in Hunan Province are trained in schools, while high school students are gathered in the provincial capital. The training period is five months, with a cost of 170,000 yuan per term. There are more than 3,000 students in training, with exceptional spirit and uniformity of steps. Then, we crossed the Xiang River to visit Yuelu Mountain, passing Tingquan Pavilion, reaching Yunlu, and paying respects to the tombs of Huang Xing, Cai E, and Zhang Huizuan. It is a pity that the group members did not discuss in advance about offering a wreath to Huang and Cai, which is unavoidable a breach of etiquette. Behind Yunlu, there are three rooms, covered with ancient iron tiles, which are rarely seen in other places. In this era of global air defense, the iron tile is something that China already had a hundred years ago. I don't know if it is suitable for today's use. At noon, we went to Hunan University, where Professor Tang Yiqing hosted a guided tour of the College of Engineering. Due to limited funding, all the equipment of the university has not yet reached the required level, but the wireless radio laboratory is more advanced.

In the afternoon, together with Mr. Wei Tingsheng, we visited the Bankers Association and the Money Dealers Association. There are fourteen banks in Changsha, with a total of more than 15 million yuan in deposits and more than 18 million yuan in loans. Banks have not been established in Changsha for a long time, and their business is not very developed. Financial power is completely controlled by money shops. The Hunan Provincial Bank relies on various money shops as brokers, so its business is particularly prosperous. Agricultural loans are being piloted by three banks, including the Bank of China. Cooperative businesses are only available along the highway. Industrial loans are only available to the Changsha First Cotton Mill, and the rest are very few. However, the Changde County branch has successively processed tung oil loans. The production of cotton is only 500,000 dan per year in the counties around Dongting Lake, so there are not many loans. Currently, banks do not deal directly with merchants, but lend to money shops, which in turn lend to merchants. There are ninety-three money shops in the city, with a total capital of only more than two million yuan, more than 20 million yuan in deposits, and more than 10 million yuan in loans. They are divided into the Xibang (Jiangxi) and Benbang (local) groups. Business is evenly developed. The Provincial Bank has long-term funds deposited in various money shops, so the Changsha silver and money market is priced daily by the Money Dealers Association, and the Bankers Association only obeys orders.

The twelfth day (April 16th), light rain. Left Changsha at 8:00 in the morning, crossed the Xiang River, passed through Ningxiang to Yiyang. Tung oil flowers lined the road. I improvised in the car: "This morning, light rain crosses the Xiaoxiang, tung oil flowers line the road, busily sending us off. The surrounding mountain scenery is like a painting, and the storming cars pass through Ningxiang in a team." Yiyang has a population of 830,000. Crossing the Zishui River, we arrived at "Bailu Pavilion." The pavilion commemorates Tang "Pei Xiu." Pei's calligraphy is passed down. Chen Baochen's calligraphy is learned from Pei. Dozens of monks from Bailu Temple lined up with their palms together to welcome us at the temple gate. I heard that the monks here also need to be trained, so their steps and movements are quite rhythmic. In the afternoon, we passed Niulu Beach, Gangkou, crossed the river twice, and arrived at Changde. Changde was originally a prosperous town in western Hunan, and the gateway for Guizhou's commerce. It has a population of 590,000, with seventeen foreigners, half of whom are Spanish, and one or two each from Britain, the United States, Germany, Japan, and France (both missionaries and merchants). Chairman He invited us to the Guanghua Theater to listen to Han opera, watch the Miao people's lion dance, and Chinese martial arts. Commander Chu also performed Tai Chi once. Changde's urban area is prosperous. Guizhou merchants are the landlords, and there are more than a hundred merchants purchasing goods. There are many western pharmacies. There are many passers-by, so there are more than 400 brothels, fourteen opium dens, and 220 smoking houses. A couplet on the Changde stage is clear and readable.

The vast sea has been experienced many times, listening to these local slang, it is unbearable to please the ears. Talented heroes gather with joy, even if it is a fisherman's song or a woodcutter's chant, it is a small expression of sincerity.

### Manufacturers' Association Petitions for Protest

Japanese Exposition Seizes Our National Products and Displays Them in Colonial Areas

The Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers' Association telegraphed Chairman Lin of the National Government yesterday, the text is as follows (abridged): Having read the Shanghai Shen Bao and Tianjin correspondence of April 23rd, we learned that a Pan-Pacific Exposition organized by Japan in Nagoya forcibly seized Chinese products in Hebei, Chahar, Pingjin and other places. When they were shipped to Japan, the Chinese Pavilion was listed in the colonial area, mixed with the two pseudo-organizations of "Manchukuo" and "Eastern Hebei." Our Chief Representative, Mr. Ji Zhongshi, considered the insult to be excessive and protested to the Japanese side, but to no avail. In this atmosphere of "good neighborliness" and "friendship," the Japanese are so maliciously insulting our country, openly placing the position of the pavilion of our independent country alongside the pseudo-state and Eastern Hebei in the exposition where countries are competing with each other, which is extremely contemptuous of our nation. This is tolerable, but what is intolerable? We dare to telegraph to you, and quickly telegraph to the authorities in Hebei and Chahar to report the facts, and order our Chief Representative, Mr. Ji Zhongshi, who participated in the exposition, to return the exhibits to China on a specific date. On the one hand, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be instructed to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese government based on the facts, so as to maintain national dignity and preserve the dignity of an independent country. The telegraph is very urgent. The Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers' Association bows.

### Yangsi District Held a Cotton Exhibition Yesterday

In Order to Improve Cotton Production Technology, Farmers flocked to Visit

The cotton exhibition organized by the Shanghai Social Bureau and the Yangsi District Municipal Committee Office held its opening ceremony at 10:00 a.m. yesterday at the Yangsi Town Municipal Committee Office.

Chen Zixin chaired the meeting and reported on the relationship between cotton production and farmers' economy, and the purpose of holding the exhibition, which is to improve cotton production technology, hoping to promote it from this district to the whole city, so that China's cotton production can meet the needs of industrial products as much as possible, reduce leakage, and build a national economic foundation. Then, representatives made speeches one after another. The meeting adjourned at about 2:00 p.m. The exhibition room is divided into two large rooms, with the words "Cotton is Spread, Borrowing for Reference, Agricultural Products are Listed, It is Worth Visiting" hanging at the entrance. Inside, there are various cotton production charts, the number of cotton seeds, the cotton weaving process, and statistics on cotton production in various countries. The exhibits were all supplied by the Central Agricultural College, the Shanghai Social Bureau, and the Municipal Farmers' Association, and are dazzling and beautiful. Farmers, men, women, old and young, from the whole district, from morning to night, although the weather was gloomy and the road was muddy, those who went to visit were shoulder-to-shoulder and endless. Farmers who visited the exhibition received a ticket and a prize was prepared. Those who won the special prize were given 50 jin of bean cake powder and Koulao (bamboo basket). Those who won the first prize were given a dustpan. The second and third prizes were given household necessities. Farmers were all smiles and delighted when they received the prizes. The exhibition closed at 6:00 p.m. It is also heard that in order to test cotton production and improve production, the district plans to designate more than 2,500 acres of farmland this year as a cotton planting test field. The cotton seeds needed are being actively selected by Municipal Committee Member Chen Zixin and will be sown in the near future. Revitalizing the countryside and improving agricultural production are indeed urgent tasks at present. It is hoped that other districts will follow suit.

### The Grain Dealers' Association Cables for Reduction of

Tax-Exempt Foreign Rice Entering Guangdong

The Shanghai Grain Dealers' Association telegraphed the Executive Yuan yesterday, the text is as follows: Wang, Acting President of the Executive Yuan in Nandong: Since Guangdong Province was approved to import 4 million dan of foreign rice grain tax-free, it has aroused appeals from officials and people of various provinces in the form of letters and telegrams, exhausting their voices, earnestly requesting to stop it.

### Commander Yang Hosted a Banquet Last Night to Entertain King Sha

King Sha Visited Yesterday and Entered Beijing This Morning

Sakdurzab, Chairman of the Suiyuan-Mongolia Council and League Chief of the Yikezhao League, accompanied by Oqirhuyagt, Jasaq Beizi of the Zha Banner of the Yi League and member of the Suiyuan-Mongolia Council, and Kangda Dorje, member of the Suiyuan-Mongolia Council and Director of the Industry Department, and a party of 43 people, returned to Shanghai from Putuo on the 23rd.

### Overseas Chinese Newspaper Reporter Xu Huili Returns to China for Investigation

Xu Huili, the leader of the Burmese overseas Chinese newspaper industry and manager of the Yangon Daily and the Xingye Daily, has lived in that country for more than 30 years. In order to investigate the current situation of the ancestral country's news industry and all construction, he returned to China and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. He went to the capital for sightseeing. Today, he will go to Hangzhou for investigation. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency met with Xu yesterday to inquire about the situation of overseas Chinese affairs and business in Burma, which is recorded as follows:

Overseas Chinese Affairs in Burma

According to Xu, the total number of overseas Chinese in Burma reaches 300,000, and Yangon accounts for about 30,000. Overseas Chinese are mostly from Guangdong, Fujian, and Yunnan provinces. Yunnan province has convenient transportation, so many people go there. Lower Burma has more people from Fujian and Guangdong, while Upper Burma has more people from Yunnan and Guangdong. Recently, because the interior of Burma is stable, overseas Chinese can be said to be safe and sound in living in that country. Especially, our country has historical relations with Burma, and the Chinese and Burmese people look almost similar, so the feelings between the people are still good. Burma is close to India, and many Indians go there. However, the people of that country welcome the Chinese and dislike the Indians. The Burmese authorities are also fair to the overseas Chinese. Since April this year, the Burmese political system has changed slightly. It is no longer under the Governor of India, but has established a Burmese Governor-General, directly under the British Emperor, and established a House of Representatives and a Senate. Three of our overseas Chinese in Burma have been elected to the Senate. However, recently, a certain faction has been radical in its xenophobic ideas. Although it is xenophobic, it is not specifically anti-Chinese, but our overseas Chinese still feel uneasy.

Rise of National Goods

When it comes to the Burmese and overseas Chinese business, it can be said that all are engaged in business, and there is no labor. There are not a few of our overseas Chinese workers in Singapore and other places in Nanyang, but not many in Burma, because the status of workers has long been estimated by Indians. Overseas Chinese in that country are mostly engaged in the timber industry and rice industry. Because of the stable situation, the large number of overseas Chinese, and the willingness to use national goods, it is still stable. This is the time for the rise of our national goods. The people of that country are economically well-off, so no matter who they are, they have at least one silk skirt (men also use it), so the promotion of national goods, especially raw silk and silk, is most welcome in that area. If they can be relocated properly, the future is very promising.

Investigating the Newspaper Industry

Xu continued to say that he has been in Burma for more than 30 years, and this is the first time he has come to Beijing and Shanghai. He deeply feels that the various constructions are great, especially the news industry, which gives him a good impression. In Yangon, there are three Chinese newspapers: Yangon, Xing Shang, and Juemin. He is in charge of Xing Shang and Yangon. This time he returns to China, in addition to visiting and constructing, he decided to take the opportunity to investigate the domestic news industry and visit the Shen, Xin, and Dagong newspapers, etc., so that he can learn from them and develop overseas Chinese newspapers in Burma and promote news from the motherland. Xu finally said that the Burmese overseas Chinese are all concerned about the motherland, and pay more attention to the motherland's politics and economy. Fortunately, transportation has been convenient recently, and the news is more well-informed. Since the domestic unity and cooperation, there was good news to comfort the overseas Chinese at that time.

### Liu Weizhang Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss

Guangxi Province Requests Central Government to Rectify Currency System

Mr. Liu Weizhang, representative of Guangxi Province, recently accompanied Chief of General Staff Cheng Qian from Guangxi to Nanjing. He arrived in Shanghai by train the night before last. A reporter from the Central News Agency paid a special visit to Mr. Liu at his residence yesterday. According to the interview:

Li and Bai Can Come to Nanjing at Any Time

In recent years, the Chief Commander Li Zongren and Deputy Commander Bai Chongxi have worked hard on all construction matters in Guangxi Province. Although limited by financial resources, considerable progress has been made. As for political and military affairs, they have all followed the Central Government's intentions and have been unified. Mr. Li and Mr. Bai have followed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and engaged in the revolution for many years, and their relationship is extremely close. All the estrangement since last year has been completely broken. The Deputy Commander had previously intended to go abroad, but after Chairman Chiang telegraphed requesting a postponement, he dismissed the idea. Mr. Li and Mr. Bai can come to Nanjing at any time.

Request Central Government to Rectify Guangxi Currency

The most difficult problem currently facing Guangxi Province is the currency system. Guangxi Province has issued a total of 40 million yuan of provincial currency, with a reserve of more than 20 million yuan. However, the value of Guangxi currency is volatile and has recently seen a sharp decline. Therefore, the Guangxi authorities have requested the Central Government to provide a fundamental solution. Specific measures are currently under study.

Postpone Meeting with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek

I originally intended to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek immediately upon arriving in Shanghai to report on the military, political, and economic situation in Guangxi Province, and to make some requests. Later, I heard that the Chairman was suffering from toothache and refused to see guests. Therefore, I now plan to postpone the meeting.

Plan to Go Abroad Dates Back to Last Year

My plan to go abroad dates back to last year before Chairman Chiang Kai-shek encountered difficulties. At that time, Chairman Chiang intended to have me and others, led by Vice Minister of Military and Political Affairs Chen Cheng, go to various countries to inspect military affairs. Later, due to the Chairman's difficulties, the matter was terminated. Recently, because Vice Minister Chen's duties were heavy and he could not leave for a long time, the Chairman intended to send me abroad first. Therefore, I have come here to ask the Chairman for further instructions on everything. As for the rumor that the Guangxi Provincial Government will allocate 150,000 yuan for me to go abroad for inspection, it is completely untrue.

### Ma Lin Returns to His Post on a Fixed Date

The Two Bureaus are Ordered to Prepare a Special Train; Acting Chairman Sends a Telegram Urging His Return

Mr. Ma Lin, Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial Government, is still staying in Shanghai due to slight health problems after returning from his pilgrimage. It is learned that Mr. Ma is scheduled to depart for Qinghai on Tuesday or Wednesday, accompanied by Mr. Tan Kemin, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government. The Two Bureaus Administration has been ordered to prepare a special train to take Mr. Ma directly to Xi'an. After Mr. Ma returned to Shanghai this time, he heard that Mr. Ma Bufang, the acting Chairman of Qinghai Province, was expanding the army. He sent a telegram to inquire and received a reply stating that this was not the case. It was also said that the people of Qinghai are currently in distress, the finances are strained, and there is no time for recuperation. How could he bear to expand the military again? This is not only the case with me, but also with Buqing's reorganization, etc. Mr. Ma Bufang also telegraphed Chairman Ma to return to Qinghai as soon as possible, and also telegraphed Tan Kemin to urge him nearby. The original telegram said: ⑴ After my uncle arrived in Shanghai, the military, civilians, and people from all walks of life, as well as relatives and family members here, have high expectations and are waiting in various places in Lanzhou. I sincerely hope that you will return as soon as possible to comfort their hopes. ⑵ Military affairs here have been pacified, and political affairs are awaiting administration. Please urge my uncle to return to Qinghai as soon as possible to comfort their hopes.

After the chairman reported on the business situation in the 25th year, the general manager reported on the situation after taking over, and the supervisors reported on the accounts for the 25th year, the chairman proposed that, in view of the current situation of the company, it is necessary to convert the original share capital into 750,000 yuan in national currency and increase the new shares by 250,000 yuan in national currency.

### Yunfei Labor-Capital Dispute

Still No News of Continued Negotiations

The Yunfei Automobile Company has been on strike since 10:00 p.m. on the 21st, and it has not been resolved for many days. It is said that the company's manager, Bai Luhua, refused the drivers' representatives to resume work before the terms of the arbitration on the 23rd, resulting in no results in the negotiations. According to the investigation, the company has been established for eighteen years, and the labor and capital have been at peace. This time, unfortunately, there was a labor dispute. If it is not fully resolved, and work is resumed on one side and negotiations are conducted on the other, it is feared that the drivers will not be in the mood to work, and it is difficult to guarantee that accidents will not occur in the service. It is said that in the past two days, most of the drivers have sincerely requested to resume work, and some have even declared that if the workers who resume work encounter danger, it has nothing to do with the company. However, in order to ensure public safety, the company is unwilling to rush to resume business in an unstable state in order to covet business, causing customers to suffer unexpected dangers. Therefore, while enduring the pain of sacrifice, the company sincerely hopes that the labor side will continue to negotiate in good faith to seek a quick solution.

According to Dagong News Agency, the labor dispute at the American-owned Yunfei Automobile Company has not been resolved. Wu Kaixian, a member of the Municipal Party Department, paid a special visit to acting Mayor Yu Hongjun the day before yesterday to discuss a solution, and summoned the company's Chinese comprador to question him, and made every effort to mediate to avoid expanding the dispute. The workers' side has been on strike for five days. If the deadlock continues, the livelihood problem will cause panic. They issued a declaration yesterday morning to ask for help from all walks of life.

### Overseas Chinese in Makassar are Enthusiastic About Helping Victims of the Henan Disaster

Henan has been suffering from severe drought for years. According to investigations, the disaster area in the province has reached more than 90 counties, and more than 9 million people have been affected. The deaths are stacked upon each other, and the situation is unbearable. In the counties with the most severe disasters, even tree bark and grass roots have been stripped bare. Recently, they have even used a kind of stone powder mixed with a little flour to fill their stomachs (note that eating this stone powder will cause bloating and death). The situation is cruel and difficult to describe. The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association received a report from the local authorities of the province and immediately began to prepare for relief. Considering that disaster relief is like putting out a fire and cannot be delayed, it was decided to first borrow 100,000 yuan from the association, together with 200,000 yuan allocated by the Ministry of Finance for emergency relief, and another 120,000 yuan for labor relief. Permanent committee member Lu Bohong and others were elected to carry the funds to investigate and distribute them, while making every effort to raise funds to ensure a continuous supply. A donation of 15,000 yuan has been received from the Overseas Chinese Disaster Relief Committee in Makassar, South Pacific, and another 3,500 yuan has been remitted continuously, all designated for the Henan disaster. This shows the overseas Chinese compatriots' deep concern for the disaster victims in their motherland. However, after the severe drought in the province, it has recently been followed by wind and hail disasters, making the situation even more serious. In recent days, the association has received disaster relief telegrams from various counties, as numerous as snowflakes. If there are no large donations and continuous relief, the dying victims will still have no chance of survival. It is believed that there is no shortage of great philanthropists at home and abroad. I hope that you will have great compassion and enthusiastically donate as much as possible. Collecting one more yuan can save one more life, and I urge all walks of life to make every effort to publicize and arouse the attention of the people of the whole country to jointly rescue and save this catastrophe, which will be immeasurable merit. The association is also scheduled to hold a board meeting on the 28th of this month to discuss all relief measures.

### Shanghai County's New and Old Outstanding Taxes Should Be Paid Within the Time Limit

The Shanghai County Government issued Announcement No. 2168 yesterday, stating that it had received Instruction No. 1686 from the Provincial Department of Finance, stating that the collection of old taxes should be expedited, and the collection of new taxes should also be expedited, without neglecting either.

All outstanding payments in the hands of the handlers have been listed in various lists and ordered to be chased by the police stations. As for the incomplete grain strings for the 24th year, they should be submitted to the counter by the owners themselves. The collection officials in each district have been ordered to list the outstanding taxes and issue a notice of liquidation of old taxes and a return receipt separately. In addition, a list of overdue households for the first phase of land price tax in the 25th year has been prepared and a reminder list of overdue households has been made, ordering the district chiefs to forward it to the township chiefs to urge them to collect it from each household. Now it is stipulated that the deadline for the liquidation of new and old taxes is approaching, and the year is coming to an end. If the collection is not strictly pursued, it will be difficult to clear the account. In addition to the separate order, it is hereby announced to all households in the county to abide by it. Regardless of new or old outstanding taxes, they must pay the required amount to the counter within the time limit, and obtain grain strings and licenses for safe business. They must not ask the collection personnel to pay on their behalf to prevent malpractices. If there are unscrupulous people who falsely claim to be handling cases, they are allowed to report the evidence and request investigation. Each should abide by this notice, and those who violate it will be punished.

### Foreign Tea Merchants Association Invests in Tea Company

Yesterday afternoon, the association chairman Ye Shichang, Chen Yizhou, and others were appointed as representatives to continue discussions with Mr. Shou Jingwei of the tea company. Both parties believe that the regulations of the distribution office still need to be revised, so it was decided to reschedule the discussion.

If the business develops, a national goods display room may be set up to display the products of shops or factories related to the bureau's freight transportation, promote quality, and expand sales. If the product merchants do not have a manager or sales agent in Shanghai, they can also entrust the cooperative to sell on their behalf. Currently, Shanghai is the focus, and it can be promoted to major ports across the country in the future. The cooperative has seven to eleven directors, one chairman, three supervisors, and one chairman of the supervisors, who are elected by the members' meeting. As for the distribution of operating profits, ⑴ 30% is allocated to the public reserve, ⑵ 20% is allocated to the public welfare fund, and ⑶ 10% is allocated to the remuneration of directors and staff.

To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in a Letter Requesting a Ban on Slaughter

The Chinese Leprosy Relief Association, recently submitted a letter to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, saying: "Respectfully to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek: Our Association is the only people's organization in our country dedicated to eradicating leprosy. Founded by the Shanghai Rotary Club and Christian philanthropists, it has been working diligently for over a decade, upholding the Christian teachings of cleansing leprosy and relying on the pure strength of the people to promote the anti-leprosy movement. All funds are derived from annual subsidies from the American Leprosy Relief Association, as well as donations from compassionate individuals and membership fees. Our Association's work is broadly divided into relief, propaganda, research, fundraising, and construction. Leprosy hospitals in Nanchang, Jiangxi; Xinhua, Hunan; Hainan Island, Guangdong, and other places have all been established with our assistance. The most notable is the establishment of the Shanghai Chinese Leprosy Sanatorium, which was built by our Association and sponsored by the former Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, as well as the philanthropic contributions of elders and benefactors from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign, enabling its successful completion. According to expert research, leprosy is not incurable. Various leprosy medications have long been invented abroad. In our country, the National Economic Commission, the National Institute of Health, and the Beiping Institute of Materia Medica have also recently introduced various effective anti-leprosy drugs. In this era of scientific advancement, it is inconceivable that the authorities and garrison troops in Guangdong and Guangxi would regard this disease as venomous snakes and scorpions, considering it a divine punishment. Their lack of basic knowledge is astonishing. According to reports received in the past year, there have been several incidents, such as the encouragement of leprosy hunts by the magistrate of Gaoyao County, resulting in the wanton disregard for human life, and the search and arbitrary execution of lepers by Regiment Commander Zhang of the 901st Regiment of the 151st Division stationed in Sihui County. The most tragic case occurred recently on March 28 (Easter morning) when the garrison troops in Yangjiang lured and killed fifty to sixty patients from the Presbyterian Leprosy Hospital. Most of these patients were Christians, and some were elders. The troops used deceptive means, first going to the village two days prior, falsely claiming that they would distribute money on a certain day and instructing them to register. Then, on Easter morning, they suddenly surrounded, arrested, and shot all the registered lepers, burying them in two pre-dug large earthen mounds. We believe that this act is intolerable under both legal and moral standards and is rarely seen throughout history, both in China and abroad. After this incident occurred, it was widely published in Western newspapers at home and abroad, inviting criticism from foreign countries and having a significant impact on our country's international standing. Therefore, we respectfully submit this letter, imploring Your Excellency to make a wise decision and take urgent action to order the chief administrators of Guangdong and Guangxi to promptly organize a special committee to address the leprosy problem in the two provinces with a comprehensive plan. Leprosy patients should be given medical and humanitarian sympathy and consideration, and the recurrence of similar incidents should be absolutely prohibited. Our Association, without overestimating our abilities, is willing to use the strength of the people's organization as a backing for the government. If appropriate, we humbly request your clear instructions. We cannot express enough our hopes and prayers. Respectfully submitted by Niu Huisheng, Lu Bohong, Shi Siming, and Chen Chunbao. Sincerely, April 22nd."

### Case of Kidnapping Uncovered: Two Children Hidden in Qianjia Temple, Nanhui, Pudong; The Twists and Turns of Luring and Extorting Ransom

Mao Zhikang and Qian Sandi Endure Extreme Intimidation; An Invitation to Tea Leads to a False Promise of a Bicycle Race; Frequent Telegrams and Letters, a Mix of Truth and Deception; The Bandit Gang's Disguises Resemble a Theatrical Drama

Mao Chaodong, a local resident living at 9 Rugao Road, had his sixteen-year-old son, Zhikang, kidnapped on the 4th of this month at noon near Zhaofeng Road and Maohai Road, along with Qian Sandi, a fourteen-year-old boy from the same hometown living at 60 Heller Road. They were hidden in a simple house near Qianjia Temple in Nanhui, Pudong. A letter

Containing Nine Envelopes

Was sent to the Mao family demanding a ransom of 10,000 yuan. The case was uncovered, and Detective Shao Jingfan, Detective Xu Yongyuan, and Detective Chen Ruisheng from the Shanjiaxing Road Police Station arrested five kidnappers from Tongzhou (Mei Fufu), Pudong (Wang Jinlin, Yang Zhitian, Qian Rongsheng), and Changzhou (Pan Baosheng), rescued the hostage Mao Zhikang, and transferred his companion Qian Sandi to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. These details have been reported in this newspaper. The trial judge, Zhong Qing, specially opened the Third Criminal Court for a hearing. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that this case involves Article 347, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law, concerning

Kidnapping for Ransom,

And Article 241, Paragraph 1, concerning abduction (since Qian was not kidnapped). He stated that Mao was studying at Jiangyin Quan Shi School, and returned to Shanghai for the spring break. His father went to Suzhou on business on the 3rd of this month and returned on the 8th. At 12 noon on the afternoon of the 4th, someone called the Mao residence and told Zhikang that Qian Quanbao from 98 Zhaofeng Road had invited him to have tea at the nearby Tongfu Teahouse. Mao then

Left and Never Returned.

The next morning at 10 a.m., a phone call came, answered by his brother Zhixiang, saying that his brother Zhikang was playing with several companions somewhere. The call ended without saying anything else. At 2 p.m., another call came, saying that his brother had been kidnapped in Yai Shan. On the morning of the 7th, a registered letter arrived, stating that Zhikang had been kidnapped and they had followed him from Jiangyin to Shanghai, demanding a ransom of 10,000 yuan. If they agreed, they should publish an

Advertisement

Stating how much they were willing to pay. The letter was signed by Mao. At 2 p.m., another call came asking if the letter had been received. On the morning of the 8th, another letter arrived, stating that the address was 169 Maohai Road, asking if an advertisement had been placed. It was found that the house was vacant. At 2:45 p.m., another phone call came, asking if they were willing to pay. His brother Zhixiang replied that they would discuss it with their father when he returned from Suzhou. An investigation revealed that Qian Quanbao, a carpenter living at 255 Tongzhou Road, knew Mao but had not made any phone calls. That afternoon, he was invited to

Have Tea at the Tongfu Teahouse

On Zhaofeng Road. On the morning of the 9th, another registered letter arrived, stating that since they had placed an advertisement stating their willingness to pay, they should place another advertisement stating the amount they were willing to pay. An investigation also revealed that Qian's brother, Gen Gen, ran a water-boiling business at 373 Zhaofeng Road. Qian's brother and Mao disappeared at the same time. An advertisement was placed offering 50 yuan for the return of his brother. It was then known that Qian Sandi and Mao were together. On the 10th, another letter arrived stating that the advertised offer of 500 yuan was too little and must be increased before they would be returned. Mao then

Increased the Amount to 5,000

Yuan. Qian Gen Gen also received a letter from the kidnappers stating that his brother was safe and would be returned in a week. At 5 p.m. on the 11th, the Mao family received another letter stating that Zhikang was unharmed and that a location would be arranged for the ransom exchange. At 10:30 a.m. on the 12th, another letter arrived, stating that the money should be placed in a cigarette case and sent to the Xia surname clothing store at 100 Zhaofeng Road, where Jiang Zhaohai would come to pick it up. The Mao family sent a relative, Tang Maosheng, with an empty cigarette case accompanied by detectives to wait at the clothing store, but no one came to collect it. On the 13th, another letter arrived stating that 5,000 yuan was still too little, and they needed 6,000 yuan. Where should it be sent? It was not stated. On the 14th, the Mao family placed another advertisement stating their willingness to pay 5,500 yuan. On the 15th, another letter arrived, containing Mao's Jiangyin school

Badge,

Stating that they were afraid that others would impersonate them to demand the ransom and to show that the letter was indeed written by the real kidnappers. It was signed by Mao himself, requesting them to place another advertisement arranging the collection for the 16th. At 2 p.m. that afternoon, another letter arrived, arranging for the money to be sent to the Xia surname clothing store at 8 p.m., where someone would come to collect it. At the appointed time, the police detectives disguised as representatives of the Mao family observed the situation in the store. After a while, the defendant Mei Fufu arrived. The detectives asked to borrow an iron for ironing clothes. The detectives then arrested him. Under interrogation, he claimed that the kidnapping was done by

Four Ningbo People,

One with a handgun and one with a knife, and that he did not participate. The leader's name was Li Zhigang. It was discovered that Mei lived next door to the Mao family and was the inside contact in this case. However, there was no one named Li Zhigang. When he was taken to the police station, he claimed that Mao was hidden in the Guohua Road area of Nanjinli. A search was conducted, but nothing was found. The next day, Mao's father returned from Suzhou and reported to the police station. Under questioning, it was revealed that Zhikang was hidden in

Qianjia Temple, Nanhui,

In the jurisdiction of Pudong County, in a simple house nearby. The detectives then accompanied him there. It was already late at night. They knocked on the door and entered, arresting Wang Jinlin and Yang Zhitian. However, the house was extremely dark, and the two children could not be found. The detectives and Mao's father shouted Zhikang's name, and a response was heard from far away. They were then found in

An Underground Hole,

Five feet deep, three feet wide, and eight feet long, covered with wooden planks with several holes drilled in them to prevent the child from suffocating. The eyes of both children were covered with cloth, and their ears were sealed with plasters to prevent them from seeing or hearing. These were immediately removed. It was discovered that the two defendants, Wang and Yang, slept on the planks above the hole every night, constantly threatening Mao that if the ransom was not received, they would cut his throat and kill him. The defendant Qian Rongsheng

Was Blind

And was the landlord of the house, commonly called "Uncle." After a while, he arrived and was also arrested. With the consent of the police station in charge, the entire group, along with the two children, were taken back to the police station. Under questioning, it was learned that the person who

Specialized in Writing Letters,

Pan Baosheng, was hiding at 129 Yangshupu Road. They rushed there and arrested him. He was a friend of the two defendants, Wang and Yang. It was discovered that on the afternoon of the 4th, the phone call to the Mao residence was made by the defendant Wang Jinlin impersonating Qian Quanbao, tricking Zhikang into going out. He met Qian on the way, and they went to a teahouse together. Wang told Mao that Mei Fufu's brother, Gen Gen, was competing in a bicycle race in Pudong and asked him to participate in a performance, after which he could return to Shanghai. Mao and Qian were fooled and followed him to the Dongjiadu Wharf in Nanshi, where they took a sampan across the river to Pudong. On the way, they met the defendant Yang Zhitian, who said that they should first go to his house, the

Simple House at Qianjia Temple,

To rest temporarily. After walking half a mile, the defendants Mei Fufu and Pan Baosheng, disguised as soldiers, wearing yellow military uniforms, Mei wearing dark glasses and a fake mustache, speaking with a northern accent, questioned the two defendants Wang and Yang, "Where are you taking these two children? Are you kidnappers?" They said that the headquarters was not far away and quickly went there. They then went to the defendant Qian Rongsheng's house, where the two children's eyes were covered with cloth and their ears were sealed with plasters. Mei took out a knife to intimidate them. The two defendants Wang and Yang pretended to be frightened, pleading for the release of the two children, but to no avail. They were then

Put into the Underground Hole.

Mei Fufu often went to inspect and directed everything, forcing Mao to write a total of two letters, while the remaining seven letters were written by Pan Baosheng. Their plan was like a play. If the case was broken and Mao did not suspect that Wang and Yang were involved in the kidnapping, and Mei and Qian's disguises could not be recognized, then these

Deceptive Tricks

Would have been very clever. These are the facts of the case. The case is requested to be postponed. It was found that the defendants Mei Fufu and Pan Baosheng were also involved in two other cases of writing threatening letters, extorting money from people, etc. Following the statements of the victims and the two children, as well as the reports of the Chinese and Western detectives, detailing the process of solving the case, Judge Zhong interrogated the defendants. They were still remanded in custody for further verification at a later date.

### Yan Duhe Was Attacked Yesterday Afternoon

The Assailant Was a Reader Suffering from Mental Illness; A Knife to the Back of the Neck, Fortunately the Injury Was Minor

The New Voice Agency reports that Yan Duhe, the deputy chief editor of the Xinwenbao and chief editor of the Xinwen Ye Bao, was attacked yesterday at 12:45 p.m. As he stepped out of his chartered car at the Xinwenbao building on Hankou Road to go to work, a middle-aged man who had been lying in wait in front of the newspaper office suddenly jumped out and forcefully stabbed Yan in the back of the neck with a file. Blood flowed profusely at the time. The assailant was wearing Chinese clothing. The newspaper's doorman and Yan's chauffeur immediately apprehended the assailant and turned him over to the general affairs department of the newspaper for investigation by the Central Police Station. Yan was stabbed and bled profusely. The knife broke off an inch or so inside his neck. Fortunately, the injury was not very serious. He immediately went to Renji Hospital for treatment, where the knife was removed. After bandaging, he returned home. It is reported that the assailant usually enjoyed reading Yan's works and suffered from mental illness. He often sent letters to Yan, accusing him of using witchcraft, otherwise he would not have been so bewitched. He had even visited Yan once. After that, he sent several letters of harassment. This time, he actually committed this heinous act. According to the assailant himself, his name is Jin Su and he used to work in the Suzhou court. He arrived in Shanghai from Suzhou yesterday morning.

### Squatters from Various Roads in the Pudong Area of Shanghai Held a Meeting Yesterday

Published a Declaration and Will Petition This Morning

The New Voice Agency reports that squatters from Linqing Road, Pingliang Road, Huade Road, Huasheng Road, Yanshan Road, Yangzhou Road, Yangshupu Road, Qiwupu Road, Meizhou Road, and other areas in the Pudong area of Shanghai are facing imminent eviction by the Shanghai Municipal Council, which has ordered all squatter settlements to be demolished by May 1st. The squatters are in a state of panic. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., they held an emergency general meeting of squatters from various roads at the Zhonghua Stage on Chaoyang Road. More than 1,200 male and female squatters attended. Tang Anping was elected chairman. The chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting and then voted on various proposals: ① Request various organizations and public groups to uphold justice and forward their request to the Shanghai Municipal Council not to demolish their homes; ② Schedule a joint petition to the Shanghai Municipal Council at 10 a.m. on April 16th; ③ Strengthen the Baojia organization; ④ Publish a declaration, which is recorded as follows: "The second point of the Founding Father Sun Yat-sen's National Construction Outline states, 'The primary task of construction is the people's livelihood, therefore, the government should work with the people to jointly develop the four major needs of the people: clothing, food, housing, and transportation.' Regarding housing, it states, 'The construction of various types of houses in accordance with major plans to provide comfortable homes for the people.' In addition, Article 10 of the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China during the period of political tutelage states, 'The people's residences shall not be entered, searched, or sealed without due process of law'; Article 12 states, 'The people have the freedom of movement, and it shall not be suspended or restricted without due process of law'; Article 16 states, 'The people's property shall not be confiscated or seized without due process of law'; Article 17 states, 'The exercise of the people's right to property shall be protected by law within the scope of not harming the public interest.' Furthermore, Article 381 of the Criminal Law states, 'Whoever destroys another person's building, rendering it unusable, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than six months and not more than five years'; and Article 2 states, 'If death or serious injury is caused, the punishment shall be heavier than for intentional harm'; and Article 382 states, 'Whoever destroys another person's property other than those mentioned in the preceding two articles, or renders it unusable, causing damage to the public or others, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than one year, detention, or a fine of not more than five hundred yuan.' Although our shacks are simple, are they not property? Are they not residences? Are they not buildings? Is our relocation or non-relocation not permitted by law? The Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession not building civilian housing, like the municipal government, is already violating the National Construction Outline and looking down on our Republic of China government and people. Now, some people say that the Shanghai Municipal Council wants to destroy our buildings and damage our property. We believe that the Municipal Council is a product of law. It is a legal, law-enforcing, and law-abiding body, not an organization of thugs, and would never do such a thing. If anyone comes to demolish our shacks, they must be thugs. If we do not receive direct protection, we can only invoke the provisions of Articles 23 and 24 of the Criminal Law, implementing legitimate defense and legitimate avoidance of danger, in order to uphold the National Construction Outline, the Provisional Constitution, and the law. This declaration is hereby made."

### Wang Chengda Intended to Commit Robbery but Bungled the Attempt

Gu Huang Was Robbed Due to…; The Detective Squad Observes the Situation

The home of the widow Gu Huang, who lived at No. 183 Hengdi Tenth Lane on Shangwen Road in the Nanshi district, was suddenly entered by three robbers the day before yesterday afternoon. They tied up Gu and her servants inside, and then ransacked the place, stealing valuable jewelry worth several hundred yuan. After the robbers fled, Gu reported the incident to the police station and asked them to investigate. Liu Huai, the captain of the Municipal Police Detective Squad, immediately dispatched squad leaders Bai Zhongqi and Shan Bin to lead their respective teams to the house to investigate. It was then that Wang Chengda, a resident of the house from Kunshan, claimed that he had also been tied up by the robbers. However, during his statements, the squad leaders noticed some inconsistencies. Upon further questioning, his lies were exposed, and he confessed to conspiring with Xu Zhusheng and others to commit the robbery. The squad then dispatched squad leader Xue Shilin and several detectives, along with Chinese and Western detectives from the French Concession Police Station, to No. 88 Huanghe Road, where they arrested six accomplices: Xu Zhusheng, Shun Ad, Li Xiaocheng, Yu Shenggen, Hu Asan, and Zhou Yisheng. They also recovered a fake pistol and the stolen goods. The squad interrogated each of them separately. They confessed that the robbery was initiated by Wang Chengda. The police are still actively pursuing the remaining accomplices and will bring them all back to the headquarters for strict questioning.

### Shanghai and Jiangsu Authorities Approve Reconstruction of Shanghai-Qingpu Highway

Qingpu-Sheshan Highway Soon to Open

The highways built by the city and surrounding districts have been completed successively. The Shanghai-Qingpu highway, from the city to Qingpu, has been operated by the Qinghu Long-Distance Bus Company since its completion last year, running long-distance buses. However, these vehicles can only reach the Yinjing Bridge Airport, which is very inconvenient for passengers. The company temporarily established a branch station at the Aidu Car Company on Aidu Road. Small cars are used to transport passengers from the branch station to Hongqiao Airport, but the cars available at the car company are scarce, often causing delays, and the vehicles are old and the roads around Hongqiao are extremely uneven, posing a safety risk. In light of this, the company has obtained approval from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works to change the route to reach the West Gate of the city directly, with construction expected to begin within the year. It is also learned that the Qingpu-Sheshan highway, from Qingpu to Sheshan, has also been completed and will soon be open to traffic. Sheshan is a famous scenic spot in the suburbs of the city, and the opening of the highway will greatly facilitate travel there.

### City Security Second Regiment Direct Communications Team's Carrier Pigeons Stolen

Cutting the Wire of the Pigeon Cage - Sold at the City God Temple

Fifteen communication carrier pigeons being trained by the Direct Communications Team of the Shanghai City Security Second Regiment at the Longhua Team Headquarters were stolen when thieves cut the wire of the pigeon cage. They were sold to Wang Bingzhang's bird shop at No. 90, next to the Osmanthus Hall of the City God Temple Yuyuan. The team recently identified the original pigeons and, along with the shop assistant, handed them over to the Yuyuan Police Station for strict investigation. The person who stole the pigeons has been handed over to the Fifth Investigation Team by the Yu Suo. According to the staff of the communications team, these carrier pigeons have been well-trained and are of considerable value. The best pigeons are worth several thousand yuan per pair. It was reported that yesterday morning, Jiang Liquan was selling two carrier pigeons at Yuyuan, when he was identified by the assistant at No. 90 and Lian Chi as the person who had sold the stolen military pigeons. The police were immediately called and Jiang was taken to the police station. According to Jiang, the pigeons he sold earlier were entrusted to him by Shao Bukuan, and he did not know they were stolen. Shao was then arrested and confessed that they were stolen by Li Jinbiao and Jiang Xiao'an, who are now on the run. In addition to ordering detectives to strictly investigate and arrest the fugitives for punishment, the defendants will first be sent to the Bureau for interrogation.

### Postal Knowledge Q&A (21)

Question: I am planning to move from Shanghai to the interior and have a lot of luggage, including some government bonds and gold jewelry. I am afraid that it will be inconvenient to carry them over a long distance. I heard that the post office can accept insured mail. Is this true? What are the procedures for mailing? Please provide details.

Answer: You can send them as insured mail (formerly known as insurance mail). There are three types of insured mail: insured letters, insured boxes, and insured parcels. Banknotes, securities, and important documents can be sent as insured letters. Gold and silver coins, gold and silver bars, gold and silver utensils, and jade and gems, if their transportation is permitted by law, can be sent as insured boxes. If sending to a place that does not handle insured boxes, they must be sent as insured parcels. The government bonds and gold jewelry you have can be sent separately according to the above categories. The mailing procedures are summarized below. (1) Insured letters must be sealed in insured envelopes prepared by the post office. There are three sizes of these envelopes: large, medium, and small. All post offices that handle insured letter services sell them. The current price is three cents for large, two cents for medium, and one cent for small. If the item to be mailed is too large to fit in the post office's large envelope, the sender can make their own using strong, opaque paper. Whether using a self-made envelope or an envelope sold by the post office, it must be properly sealed. In addition to applying sealing wax to the seal and stamping it with the sender's seal, the seal must also be applied to the designated area on the envelope for identification. The insured amount should be clearly stated on the envelope. The maximum amount per item is one thousand national currency. The insurance fee is charged at 1% of the insured amount, with a minimum of ten cents. In addition, letter postage and registration fee are required. (2) Insured boxes must be made of metal or sturdy wood. The wooden boards must be at least eight millimeters thick. The outside is tightly tied with rope, and the joints and the four sides of the box are sealed with sealing wax. In addition to the insurance fee, postage is charged at four cents per fifty centimeters of weight, with a minimum of twenty cents. A registration fee is also required. (3) The procedures for sending insured parcels are generally the same as for sending ordinary parcels. However, the seams on all sides must be sealed with sealing wax and stamped with the sender's seal. The maximum insured amount is divided into two categories: no more than one thousand yuan and five hundred yuan per item. The insurance fee is charged at 0.5% of the insured amount, with a minimum of five cents. For shipments to Sichuan, the insurance fee is charged at 2% of the insured amount, with a minimum of ten cents. Ordinary parcel fees are also required.

The above are general procedures. For detailed information, please consult the local post office. However, please note that the stamps to be affixed to the insured mail must be affixed separately, without overlapping or sticking them on the edges. You can also inquire at the local post office whether insured mail services are available in various locations. If the post office in your destination does not handle insured mail, government bonds can be sent by registered mail and gold jewelry can still be sent by insured parcel, but only insured to the last post office that handles insured mail services before the destination. For example, if Ganzu Gaolan does not have insured parcels, an insured parcel sent from Nanjing to that location can be insured to Pingliang. The section from Pingliang to Gaolan will be sent as an ordinary parcel.

### Eleven-Year-Old Girl Attempts Suicide in the Huangpu River

Fortunately Rescued by a Passerby

Xi Wenqing, an eleven-year-old girl from Shaoxing, was working as an adopted daughter in the home of a certain family at No. 12, Zhaxing Lane, Bai'er Road, French Concession. She was assigned to sweep and clean every day. If she failed to meet their expectations, she would be whipped. Unable to bear the pain, Xi girl secretly escaped the residence the other night around seven o'clock, planning to commit suicide in the Huangpu River in Nanshi. Crying all the way, she was about to jump off the beach near the Gaochang Temple Jiangbian pier when she was spotted by a passerby, who managed to rescue her and call the police. She was sent to the Ximen Branch Bureau. After questioning by the police, Xi girl refused to reveal the reason for her suicide, only saying that she was being abused and did not want to return home. The bureau learned the background and, out of compassion, sent her to the General Bureau's relief department.

### Overseas Chinese Liang Shen Advocates Maintaining Robe and Jacket Formal Wear

Disagrees with Chen Jiageng's Opinion on Reforming Dress

Central News Agency reports that Liang Shen, a pillar and leading figure among overseas Chinese in Malaya, initiated and donated funds for the construction of the Singapore Consulate and has been actively contributing to various domestic construction projects. He is particularly concerned about the state of domestic industries. Yesterday, in response to Chen Jiageng's published opinion on reforming dress, he sent a letter to the Shanghai Chinese Industrial Foreign Trade Association, expressing his views. The gist of the letter is as follows: Clothing is related to the national etiquette system and is of great importance. The National Government's stipulation of a blue robe and black jacket as formal wear is dignified, noble, comfortable, and economical. The raw materials for robes and jackets are entirely domestic, and the prices are cheap and easy to purchase. As far as I know, in Nanyang, a set of robes and jackets costs no more than ten yuan, while a Western-style formal suit costs Japanese yen. All countries in the world have their own national costumes to preserve their national characteristics. To say that the mandarin jacket is a relic of the late Qing Dynasty and must be abolished is not only because the five races are now one family and there should be no distinction between races, but also because the traces left by the Qing Dynasty are more than just the mandarin jacket. Dr. Sun Yat-sen was the first to advocate overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, but during his lifetime, when he lived in the country, he often wore robes and jackets. His last photograph, taken when he passed through Japan to Beiping in the 14th year of the Republic, also shows him wearing a long gown and mandarin jacket. Furthermore, on important occasions in our country today, robes and jackets are worn. In addition, the weather in the motherland is cold, and the general public finds robes and jackets convenient, light, warm, and economical as casual wear. To associate the stipulation of long gowns and mandarin jackets with other issues is too far-fetched. Therefore, I advocate that overseas Chinese in Nanyang should wear Chinese formal wear for celebrations, which will not only preserve national essence but also benefit the future of domestic goods.

### China Harmonica Society Enthusiastically Assists in Disaster Relief

The China Harmonica Society recently held its Sixth Anniversary Music Performance at the Pudong Fellow Provincials Association, attended by more than a thousand Chinese and foreign guests, and was a great success. It is learned that the ticket sales that evening totaled 183 yuan and 25 fen. After deducting 150 yuan for expenses, there was a surplus of 33 yuan and 25 fen. The society, having already purchased four dozen Zhen Shan Mei harmonicas (worth about 120 yuan), specially supervised by President Wang Qingdong, to be donated to Chairman Fu of Suiyuan and General Tang for organizing harmonica teams in military clubs, and in view of the severe disaster situation in Sichuan Province, which urgently needs relief, the society yesterday handed over the entire proceeds of 33 yuan and 25 fen to the Dagong Newspaper Office for transfer to disaster relief, fulfilling its duty to help those in need. The society's Sixth Anniversary Special Issue, with rich and exciting content, has now been compiled and is ready for printing and is scheduled to be published on the 15th of next month. Schools, organizations, and libraries with official letters or who participated in the Sixth Anniversary Conference can attach their admission tickets and send them to the society's general headquarters at No. 1, Gongguo Lane, Jiangwan Road. All those who request it will be sent a large volume as a souvenir.

(B) Tour groups and visiting groups: It is proposed to follow the methods of the Friendship Jingwu Associations and appoint a responsible committee member to be in charge of preparations. (C) Gym and billiard room: The association has no suitable location for a gym, so it is proposed to abandon this idea. However, the association has many members of the Zhi Rou Boxing Society, which can also help with fitness. For the billiard room, it is proposed to solicit donations for a billiard table, determine a suitable room, and start preparations. (D) Library: It is proposed to appoint Chen Binyang to take care of it concurrently, solicit donations of books and newspapers, send staff to visit the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Library, follow the latest methods, and formulate regulations to start preparations. A committee member must also be assigned to be in charge of this task. (E) Expanding and adding schools: It is proposed to expand and add schools when the existing schools have sufficient funds.

### Strange Affair in Yangjing Town, Pudong: City God Takes a Wife

Female Shamans Employ Mystification to Extort Money; Ignorant Men and Women Stubbornly Cling to Delusion

The City God enshrined in the Dongjing Temple at Dongchukou, Yangjing Town, Pudong, titled "Duke of Majestic Spirit" by imperial decree, is said to be the loyal Song Dynasty minister Li Ruoshui. The villagers, remembering his sacrifice for the country, erected a statue in the temple during the Daoguang era of the former Qing Dynasty and held a festival every spring to commemorate him. It happened that Chen Qiutao, a local from Xichukou in the same town who ran a butcher shop, had a daughter named Yue'e, who died at the age of seventeen. Eighteen years have passed since her death. Not long after her death, the town's female shamans and others spread rumors that the City God wished to marry Yue'e's spirit as his wife. The ignorant Qiutao rashly agreed. The year before last, he collected funds to build a large statue to be placed in the temple, to reside with the City God. Recently, the female shamans and others have again proclaimed that the City God now desires to marry, for the sake of a lasting arrangement. Chen Fu and Gao Cailie agreed to hold the wedding ceremony yesterday. Because the matter was so strange, it caused a sensation throughout the town and surrounding villages. The people, young and old, helped each other to come and watch the spectacle. The Chen residence had distributed wedding invitations in advance and received congratulatory gifts from relatives and friends, so many went to partake in the wedding feast. At eight o'clock in the morning, the bride's effigy was first carried back to the Chen residence, which is commonly called "returning to the hall." The wedding ceremony was to take place at six o'clock in the evening. When the female effigy was sent to the temple, several bands of ceremonial guards were hired, and the sounds of gongs, drums, and musical instruments echoed along the way, creating an extraordinary spectacle. Spectators all regarded it as a strange affair, but in reality, it was all the work of female shamans employing mystification to extort gifts and collect money. Yet the general ignorant men and women stubbornly cling to delusion, which is truly lamentable and laughable. It is earnestly hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this.

### Amendments to the Land Law

— Xu Deguang

Land is a factor of production and the most important resource for human life. The well-being of the people, the prosperity or decline of society, and the rise and fall, survival, and extinction of dynasties are all closely related to land issues. In recent years, our country, recognizing the importance of land issues, has promulgated the Land Law and its Implementation Regulations, as well as the General Outlines of Land Administration Implementation Procedures for various provinces and cities, one after another, and stipulated that they should all be implemented from March 1, 1936. However, although the Land Law has been promulgated for many years, its provisions, when examined in light of the actual national conditions, are quite incongruous. Therefore, many have proposed amendments. However, since the Land Law has not yet been implemented, making amendments hastily would undermine the dignity of the law. Although many corrections have been made in the formulation of the Implementation Regulations of the Land Law and the General Outlines of Land Administration Implementation Procedures for various provinces and cities, only Articles 31, 38, and 64 of the Implementation Regulations and Articles 20 and 22 of the General Outlines of Land Administration Implementation Procedures have slightly adopted the opinions of the suggestions. Now, the author will briefly present my humble opinions based on my limited observations, for discussion with the people of the country:

㊀ On the Issue of Determining Land Prices

㊀ The determination of land prices should strictly adhere to the principles advocated by the Premier, allowing landowners to freely declare their land prices, and the government should collect all land taxes based on these declared land prices.

(Method 1) After a landowner declares the land price in accordance with the law, the land administration agency should immediately investigate whether the declared price matches the market price. If it is found that the declared land price differs from the market price by more than ten percent, a reasonable deadline should be set for the landowner to correct it. If the landowner fails to correct it within the deadline, the land may be purchased at the declared price.

(Method 2) If a landowner fails to declare the land price within the deadline, the government shall estimate it based on the market price and with reference to the prices of neighboring lands.

(Explanation) Article 238 of the Land Law stipulates that land prices are divided into declared land prices and estimated land prices, with land tax being levied based on the estimated land prices and land value increment tax being levied based on the declared land prices. This method of taxation, when considered in light of the principles of taxation, is particularly unfair. Furthermore, the valuation method (Article 241 of the Land Law) lacks any standard, leaving people at a loss and easily creating opportunities for valuation personnel to engage in corruption. The Land Administration Society of Xiang Sui advocated that land prices should be based on the declarations made by landowners, but there were no provisions for corresponding restrictive measures, which is a point of omission. If land prices are left entirely to the free declaration of the people without any standard, the people, accustomed to their old habits, will inevitably tend to underreport, which would greatly deviate from the original intention of the Premier in determining land prices. The method proposed in this article, on the one hand, can give the people the opportunity to freely declare land prices, and on the other hand, can correct land prices to meet the principles of fair taxation and be more suitable for national conditions.

Author's Note: The initial draft of this article was completed on March 25 of this year and submitted to the Shen Bao Economic Journal for publication. However, the editor thought the original draft was too long and asked for it to be shortened before it could be published. Later, I read in the newspaper that the 4th Annual Meeting of the Land Administration Society of China discussed how to determine land prices and resolved: ㊀ Land prices should be based on the declarations made by the people, but before the declaration, the land administration agency should determine and announce standard land prices with reference to market prices or revenue values as a reference for the declaration, ㊁ When declaring land prices, the people may refer to the standard land prices and make increases or decreases within a reasonable range, ㊂ If the people fail to declare in accordance with the law, the standard land price shall be used as their land price. This method of determining land prices is quite close to the author's proposal. However, whether the so-called standard land prices are determined by district or by household needs to be clarified. Also, if the land price declared by the people differs from the standard land price by a significant amount, whether the government should immediately use the standard land price as their land price, and whether this would cause resentment among the people, are points that need to be studied.

㊁ On the Issue of Land Tax System

㊀ Land value tax should be implemented differently for urban land and rural land based on their respective characteristics—urban land focusing on preventing land price increases, and rural land focusing on preventing land concentration—using either proportionally progressive tax or surplus progressive tax.

(Method 1) For urban land with a value of less than 300 yuan per square zhang, a tax rate of 10 to 20 per mille of the declared land price should be levied; for every 100 yuan increase in value per square zhang above 300 yuan, the tax rate should increase by 1 per mille, up to a maximum of 60 per mille.

The local government may, in light of the local financial or socio-economic conditions, submit a proposal to the central land administration agency for approval to appropriately increase or decrease the highest limit of the lowest tax rate per unit land price and the amount of land price on which each tax rate is based, but by no more than a factor of two.

(Method 2) For rural land owned by a household in the same rural area (such as a county), a tax rate of 10 to 15 per mille of the declared land price should be levied for the total value below 5,000 yuan; for the portion exceeding 5,000 yuan, each 2,500 yuan should be considered a tax bracket, with the tax rate increasing by 1 per mille per bracket, up to a maximum of 80 per mille.

The local government may, in light of the local financial and economic conditions, submit a proposal to the central land administration agency for approval to appropriately increase or decrease the highest amount of the total value of rural land at the lowest tax rate and the amount of land price on which each tax rate is based, but by no more than 20 percent.

(Explanation) The land value tax rates stipulated in Articles 291 to 296 of the Land Law do not distinguish between high and low land prices, but only between improved land, unimproved land, and wasteland, applying the same tax rate across the board. The tax system is inevitably rigid and has no effect on preventing land price increases. Furthermore, it cannot replace the currently burdensome agricultural tax. Once the system is reformed, local finances will experience great difficulties. The Xiang Sui Land Administration Society proposed to switch to a progressive tax system, but the method it adopted was merely a unified and flexible land restriction method with progressive land value tax rates, which only serves to promote the utilization of cultivated land and prevent land concentration, and is most suitable for implementation in rural areas. As for urban areas, if the same tax system is adopted, it would not only be unnecessary but also create many obstacles. Since the personal surnames in our country today have not been registered, if the same person uses hundreds of different names to register their property, the government has no way to verify it, and the effectiveness of this land restriction method would be zero, and it would be impossible to implement. The method proposed in this article, on the one hand, can adapt to the actualities of today's society to enable the land value tax system to replace the agricultural tax as soon as possible, and on the other hand, can prevent urban land price increases to solve urban land problems. Although it is not a perfect solution, it is still better than the other. As for the adoption of a proportionally progressive land value tax system for urban land, some may think that the tax rate is too high. However, this type of tax rate was once universally implemented in Qingdao and was considered convenient by the citizens. Furthermore, the current land tax levied in major cities, if calculated together with the house tax, generally has a tax rate of around 20 per mille. Moreover, in terms of the general land prices in various cities today, except for a few major cities, there are probably not many lands with a value of over 300 yuan per square zhang in a city. The effect of this progressive tax system is merely to prevent future land price increases and has no intention of increasing the current burden on citizens. Therefore, there should be no problem in this regard.

㊁ Urban land improvements should not be taxed at all. However, urban areas that originally levied house taxes and other levies and cannot immediately abolish them due to local financial conditions before the implementation of progressive land value tax rates may submit a proposal to the central land administration agency for approval to temporarily continue to levy a portion, but not exceeding 60 percent of the original tax rate.

(Explanation) Our country's Land Law stipulates that urban land improvements must still be taxed. Although the legislative authorities may have financial factors in mind, it still violates the principles of land taxation. After the implementation of the progressive land value tax system, this type of tax system should be abolished to avoid increasing the burden on citizens.

㊂ The standard for calculating land value increment tax in the Land Law should be clearly stated to be based solely on the value of the bare land, or measures should be taken to ensure that the various articles on land value increment tax are mutually connected to avoid misunderstandings in interpretation.

(Explanation) The standard for calculating land value increment tax, according to the provisions of Articles 229, 259, 286, and 309 to 308 of the Land Law, can be presumed to be based solely on the value of the bare land. However, because the wording of the articles is repetitive and the meaning is not clear enough, misunderstandings are inevitable. The Xiang Sui China Land Administration Society may have therefore misunderstood that the levy of increment tax is calculated together with the value of improvements and special improvements (see the explanation of Item 2, Subparagraph B of the Society's opinion). To avoid future misunderstandings, the author proposes that the legislative authorities make a clear regulation on the standard of this calculation.

㊃ Land value increment tax should only be levied on the sale or transfer of land as well as on transfers by gift.

(Explanation) The levy of land value increment tax is more convenient only when implemented upon the sale or transfer or transfer by gift. As for transfers by inheritance or after fifteen years without transfer, it is more difficult to levy. Why? Because the general custom in our country is that inheritance facts mostly occur at the time of the deceased's death. Once the inheritance facts occur, the heirs often conceal the property of the deceased and do not report it, and can still use the deceased's name to manage their estate, which the government has no way to verify, and thus has no way to start taxation. As for land that has not been transferred after fifteen years, the calculation of the increment in value is difficult to be accurate and fair. Furthermore, since taxpayers have no cash income, it is difficult to pay cash. Moreover, according to actual estimates in Guangzhou City, the number of households that do not transfer land during the fifteen-year period still accounts for the majority of the total number of households in the district. Once taxation is implemented, great difficulties will inevitably arise, so it seems impossible to start taxation.

㊄ The tax rate for land value increment tax should be appropriately increased or decreased depending on the length of time that the landowner has held the land.

(Explanation) The general prices of goods in society tend to rise over a long period, and land prices often rise along with them. Under these circumstances, although the landowner enjoys the benefit of land value appreciation, their purchasing power is not significantly enhanced due to the simultaneous rise in prices. In reality, there is no benefit at all. If, solely because of its apparent appreciation, a heavy increment tax is levied, it would be unfair. Furthermore, land that has been occupied for a long time should not be compared to speculators, and its tax rate should also be reduced. Conversely, if land is frequently transferred within a short period of time, then its tax rate should be increased, which would be fair and prevent short-term land speculation.

㊅ The increment tax for wasteland and unimproved land should be appropriately increased by 20 percent to one time.

(Explanation) Articles 292, 293, 295, and 296 of the Land Law regarding the increase in tax rates for unimproved land and wasteland are limited to land value tax and do not extend to increment tax, which has not fully发挥(fā huī, bring into play) its function in promoting land utilization and preventing land speculation. This article is a special supplement.

㊆ The land value tax for wasteland and unimproved land should be appropriately increased depending on the local socio-economic conditions, and there is no need to specifically stipulate it.

(Explanation) Our country's current socio-economy is still extremely declining, and rural productivity is also low. Wasteland is everywhere, and there is a reason for this. If the landowner does not intentionally waste the land, then under these circumstances, there is no need to increase their burden, otherwise it will be useless and even harmful.

㊂ On the Issue of Land Rent

㊀ Agricultural land rent should be divided into several grades, and the land administration agency should stipulate the maximum limit of each grade of land rent based on the type and nature of each grade of land, its production capacity, and the ratio of its bare land price. The land rent for the best-grade land should still not exceed 8 percent of the annual interest on the bare land price (this land rent is naturally not limited to being paid in money).

If the agreed-upon land rent exceeds the maximum limit for its grade of land, it should be reduced to the maximum limit; if it is less than the maximum limit for its grade of land, it should be in accordance with the agreement.

(Explanation) Article 177 of the Land Law regarding the regulations for agricultural land does not consider the amount of capital and labor applied by farmers or the degree of soil fertility, but uniformly stipulates that the land rent shall not exceed 37.5% of the total harvest of agricultural products. It is inevitably unfair, and the result is only to increase the burden on farmers without harming the landlords in the slightest. The Xiang Sui Land Administration Society had a proposal to use the bare land price to calculate land rent, which is already a significant improvement compared to the current regulations of the Land Law. However, the methods adopted by the Society stipulate that land rent should only be calculated based on the bare land price, without considering the degree of soil fertility, which is also a point of deficiency. Land with high prices does not necessarily have strong production capacity, and land with low prices does not necessarily have weak production capacity. Calculating solely based on the bare land price, without considering the level of land production capacity, does not conform to the principles of fair taxation and the meaning of assisting tenant farmers.

㊃ On the Issue of Land Distribution

㊀ The local land administration agencies should, for the land within their jurisdiction, with the approval of the central land administration agency, stipulate the minimum amount of land ownership for farmers based on the nature and use of the land and should find ways to make it easier for farmers to obtain the minimum amount of land.

(Method) When the local land administration agencies conduct land price declarations, they should also conduct "land needs registration." Tenant farmers who have no land or small farmers who already have land but have not reached the minimum amount may apply to the government. The government should immediately find ways to raise funds or issue land bonds to collect land at the declared land price at any time to transfer to farmers who cultivate it themselves. As for the land price that farmers should pay, a period of more than ten years may be stipulated to pay it back in installments.

(Explanation) Article 14 of the Land Law has regulations on limiting the maximum amount of land owned by individuals or organizations for private land. However, it does not define the minimum amount of land that general small farmers rely on to maintain their minimum livelihood, which does not conform to the essence of the Principle of People's Livelihood in protecting the interests of farmers and equalizing land rights. This article is specially based on the Premier's advocacy of equalizing land rights and the meaning of "land to the tiller" to stipulate that farmers should have a minimum amount of land ownership.

㊄ On the Issue of Land Reclamation

㊀ If wasteland requires a large-scale organization to be reclaimed, the land administration agency should still allow the land to be contracted by the reclaimer. This type of reclamation should not be limited to citizens who cultivate it themselves and should obtain the right to cultivate the land free of charge for 20 years from the date of completion of the reclamation.

㊁ The system of vicarious reclamation stipulated in the Land Law should be abolished.

(Explanation) In our country today, production is backward, and wasteland is everywhere. In order to promote production, in already reclaimed areas, a large amount of capital and labor should be applied for intensive management; as for wasteland areas, capital should be attracted for large-scale development. The system of vicarious reclamation stipulated in the Land Law sets various restrictions on the interests of the vicarious reclaimer (Articles 200 and 205 of the Land Law), which is contrary to the way to encourage reclamation and should be amended as soon as possible, otherwise it will be impossible to promote land utilization to achieve the purpose of equalizing land rights.

㊅ On the Issue of Land Registration

㊀ For land within their jurisdiction that has not been registered overdue, the land administration agencies of various provinces and cities should, in accordance with the methods of the Nanjing Municipal Government, make a presumed registration of the ownership of the land by the land administration agency.

(Explanation) The presumed registration method was created by the Nanjing Municipal Government. The city adopted this method starting in 1936, which was very effective in督促(dū cù, urge) the progress of registration work. In the future, the land administration agencies of various provinces and cities can follow and promote this method in order to complete the preliminary work of land consolidation.

㊆ On the Issue of Urban Housing

㊀ It should be stipulated that house rents should never exceed 12 percent of the annual interest on the land and building value recorded in the land price register. If the landlord has other facilities in the house besides the building (such as running water and electric lights), they may charge an appropriate additional rent. The calculation of this additional rent should be equal to the interest rate used to calculate the house rent.

From the date of implementation of the amendments to this law, if the originally stipulated rent exceeds the above provisions, the tenant may pay according to the above standards; if the originally stipulated rent is less than the above provisions, it should be in accordance with the original stipulations, and the landlord may not increase the rent in any name.

㊁ Article 165 of the Land Law regarding the provision that deposit interest is regarded as part of the rent should be applied at any time, without any time limit.

(Explanation) Articles 163 to 165 of the Land Law regarding various regulations on house rents are intended to prevent the rise of urban housing rents in order to solve the housing problem. However, the regulations of each article are subject to time limits for implementation. The methods are not thorough, and the implementation is even more sluggish. They are not very effective in protecting the interests of citizens and should be amended as soon as possible.

㊇ On the Issue of Land Tax Implementation Procedures

㊀ Before the land survey and registration have been completed, the land administration agencies of various provinces and cities should quickly conduct land price declarations in preparation for changing to land tax.

㊁ In areas where land price declarations have been conducted but land value tax has not yet been levied, the district valuation work should be stopped immediately, and in accordance with the methods proposed in Item 1 of this article, the declared land prices should be investigated to see if they match the market prices, and the people should be ordered to correct them appropriately.

㊂ After the land price declaration is completed, before the Land Law is amended, the land value tax will be temporarily levied according to the current tax rates. If it is an area that has always levied agricultural tax and its tax rate is heavier than the current land tax rate, the agricultural tax may be levied as before.

㊃ In areas where land value tax has been levied, which were originally taxed according to the estimated land price, the tax will temporarily continue to be levied as before, and the tax will be changed to be levied according to the declared land price after the five-year period expires.

㊄ In areas where land value tax has been levied, increment tax should be implemented as soon as possible, and contract tax should be waived at the same time. —April 10, 1937—

### Implementation of Tax Exemption for Imported Rice in Guangdong Province

— Li Yinbei

㊀

The issue of tax exemption for imported rice in Guangdong Province, which rice merchants in various provinces and cities have vehemently opposed and deemed infeasible, has ultimately succumbed to the established reality. With a "simple and quick method," the Guangdong government has signed and registered permits for four million "shi dan" (a unit of dry measure) of imported rice and grain, to be imported in batches over the four months of April, May, June, and July. Even the joint deliberation by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, submitted to the Executive Yuan, adheres to the principle of maintaining the original plan. At most, to accommodate the earnest pleas of the rice merchants, it stipulates that "imports can be temporarily suspended when there is a surplus of domestic rice." The matter seems to be settled, leaving little room for further discussion. However, under the overarching premise of sustaining the people's food supply, officials speak from the perspective of officials, and merchants speak from the perspective of merchants, each with their own vested interests. The current solution only addresses the tax-exempt import of these four million "shi dan" of foreign rice. Whose proposal is truly sound remains to be seen, proven by facts.

㊁

The reason for the tax exemption on imported rice in Guangdong Province this time is the high price of rice. According to the telegram sent to the central government last winter by the Guangdong military and political authorities, one yuan could only buy six or seven "jin" (a unit of weight). During the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee this spring, Central Committee member Deng Qingyang mentioned that one yuan could only buy seven "jin" of rice in Guangdong. (See the Shen Bao of February 16th). Let's assume that the selling price of Guangdong rice is seven "jin" per yuan (calculated using the old scale). Now, according to the calculation that one "shi" (another unit of dry measure) of rice equals 180 "jin" on the "shi" scale, and using a discount of 0.838 to convert to the old scale, it would be 150 "jin." If we calculate based on the Guangdong rice price of only seven "jin" per yuan, then each "shi" of rice should sell for more than 21 yuan. Compared to the rice price in Shanghai, the difference is almost double! Considering this rice price, the general population in Guangdong who consume Guangdong rice would naturally find it difficult to survive. However, there are two points we must pay attention to regarding this price: firstly, the rice price disclosed by Guangdong Province may be the highest price of high-grade rice, chosen to attract the attention of the central government and the whole country. As for the price of medium or low-grade rice consumed by the general population in Guangdong, it may not be calculated based on this rice price. Secondly, the rice price disclosed by Guangdong Province is based on the Guangdong currency. It must be known that there is a significant difference in the exchange rate between the Guangdong currency and the commonly used legal tender (fabi). According to the current situation, the exchange rate between the "hao" (a fractional currency unit) banknotes of Guangdong Province and the "shen chao" (another name for fabi, legal tender) is determined in accordance with the financial policy of the Guangdong Province Finance Department: the median ratio is set between plus 48 and plus 5. However, in recent normal circumstances, the Guangdong currency has generally maintained an exchange rate of plus 5. In other words, one and a half yuan of Guangdong "hao" banknotes can be exchanged for one yuan of legal tender; one yuan of Guangdong "hao" banknotes can be exchanged for about 66.7 cents of legal tender. Calculated in this way, one "shi" of Guangdong rice sells for 21 yuan in Guangdong currency, which is equivalent to only 14 yuan in legal tender. Observing the selling price in Guangdong currency and the selling price in legal tender, there is a huge difference of seven yuan in between. If we compare the selling price in legal tender with the current cost of selling domestic rice to Guangdong, then the current rice price in Guangdong Province cannot really be considered expensive. Let's take the excerpt from the recent submission by representatives of rice merchants from various provinces and cities to Mr. Wu Tiecheng, the new chairman of Guangdong, to observe the market price of domestic rice sold to Guangdong: ㊀ The highest-quality late rice from Jiangxi and Hunan sells for 10.34 yuan per 180 "shi jin" (equivalent to one "shi"), plus one yuan for transportation and other expenses, making the value of each "jin" 6.3 cents, and one yuan can buy 15-16 "jin." ㊁ The medium-quality early rice from Jiangxi and Hunan sells for 9.45 yuan per 180 "shi jin", plus one yuan for transportation and other expenses, making the value of each "jin" 5.8 cents, and one yuan can buy 17-18 "jin." ㊂ The highest-quality brown rice from Hunan and Hubei sells for 8.5 yuan per 180 "shi jin", plus one yuan for transportation and other expenses, making the value of each "jin" 5.3 cents, and one yuan can buy 19 "jin." (See the Shen Bao of April 12th). Based on this excerpt, let's try to calculate the Guangdong currency price at which domestic rice is sold in Guangdong after it is shipped there: The highest-quality late rice from Jiangxi and Hunan sells for about 17 yuan per "shi" in Guangdong currency. The medium-quality early rice from Jiangxi and Hunan sells for about 14.12 yuan per "shi" in Guangdong currency. The highest-quality brown rice from Hunan and Hubei sells for about 12.78 yuan per "shi" in Guangdong currency. However, this is still considered too low compared to the rice price in Guangdong Province, where one yuan can only buy seven "jin" of rice. It must be known that there is another reason that we must pay attention to! According to the investigation by the former Rural Revival Committee in Anhui Province: from Wuhu to Guangzhou, there are as many as 54 kinds of expenses and items for various intermediate consumptions that are sold to consumers. And the total sum of these 54 kinds of consumption and expenses actually costs about 3.4 yuan per "shi" of rice. (See the Wuhu Rice Market Survey by the Social and Economic Research Institute). By analogy, for the rice and grain from Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, except for a small part of Hunan and Hubei rice that can be directly transported to Guangdong via the Yuehan Railway, the rest of the rice and grain from Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi are loaded onto river steamers and transported to Shanghai before being transshipped. Therefore, the cost of transporting them to Guangdong is definitely not enough to cover the one yuan transportation and other expenses mentioned in the excerpt. Rice and grain are transported and transshipped, and all the leakage, loss, and accidental consumption in between must be calculated into the cost. Therefore, the consumption in transportation should not be lower than that of Anhui rice. If this kind of consumption is added to the cost of selling domestic rice to Guangdong, then the rice price after arriving in Guangdong should be comparable to the current selling price in Guangdong Province.

㊂

Whether the rice price in Guangdong Province has the possibility of continuing to rise or fall in the future depends on the profits and losses of shipping domestic rice to Guangdong. Therefore, when we study the issue of Guangdong's tax exemption on imported rice, the quantity of domestic rice shipped to Guangdong is indeed something that cannot be ignored. Recently, the number of domestic rice shipments to Guangdong has been recorded incompletely in newspapers. In order to conduct a thorough study, we will estimate the number of domestic rice shipments to Guangdong in two parts: by water and by land. According to the source of domestic rice in Guangdong, it is nothing more than Hubei rice and Hunan rice transported to Guangdong via the Yuehan Railway; Guizhou rice transported to Guangdong via Wuzhou; and Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui rice transported to Guangdong via Shanghai. Since the Yuehan Railway opened last autumn, the exact amount of rice transported to Guangdong is something we have not yet seen. However, according to the joint telegram recently sent by the agricultural and commercial groups of Hankou City to oppose Guangdong's tax exemption on imported rice: since the Yuehan Railway opened to traffic, it has transported about 60,000 tons of rice and grain to Guangdong, equivalent to 672,000 "shi." (See the Shen Bao of April 12th). Furthermore, according to the statistics of domestic rice transported to Guangdong in the past three months published in the same day's Shen Bao: 450,000 packages in January, 600,000 packages in February, and 750,000 packages in March. The total amount of domestic rice transported to Guangdong in these three months has reached 1.8 million packages. If each package is counted as one "shi," it would be 1.8 million "shi." However, since the new grain harvest in various places last autumn in Guangdong Province, the amount of domestic rice transported to Guangdong is definitely more than this number. Let's take a look at the accumulation of grain exports to Guangdong from October to December of last year, which can be seen in the daily commercial news column of the Shen Bao. From October to December 1936, the cumulative amount of domestic rice shipped from Shanghai to Guangdong in the three months of October, November, and December was 477,300 packages. If the capacity of each package is calculated as one "shi," then the total amount of domestic rice shipped to Guangdong Province from Shanghai in these three months was 477,300 "shi." Assuming that the Yuehan Railway transported half of the total 60,000 tons of domestic rice to Guangdong during these three months, then the amount of rice transported to Guangdong by the Yuehan Railway at this time would be 336,000 "shi." Adding the water and land transportation together, it would be 813,300 "shi." Adding this number to the amount of domestic rice transported to Guangdong in the past three months, the total amount of domestic rice arriving in Guangdong Province in the past half year is 2,613,300 "shi." Secondly, as for the Guizhou rice transported to Guangdong from Wuzhou, how much is it? Now, we are unable to estimate it due to a lack of research data. Fortunately, Guizhou Province does not produce much rice, and due to repeated bans on rice exports, we estimate that the amount of Guizhou rice transported to Guangdong is not very large.

As for the inventory of domestic rice, it is impossible to estimate. Just based on the calculation of the banking industry's investment in agricultural warehouse collateral loans last year, it is 13,800,000 yuan. (See the article "Bank Rural Investment Driven by the New Monetary System" in this publication, issue 218). Although it may not be this number in reality, let's assume this number to calculate; then, according to the rice price of 10 yuan per "shi" last winter, buying with 70% loans can pledge about 2 million "shi" of rice. However, it is feared that it will not be maintained until now, and it will be unloaded at any time. As for the inventory of merchants, what is it like? According to the statistics in the telegrams from the All-Province Federation of Commerce and other groups in Hubei Province: Hunan has 2.5 million "dan" of rice in stock; Hubei has 2 million "dan" of rice in stock; Jiangxi has 1 million "dan" of rice in stock; Anhui has 2.5 million "dan" of rice in stock. The four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui have a total of 9 million "dan" of rice in stock. Together with the agricultural warehouse inventory and the rice and grain waiting to be shipped in Jiangsu and Shanghai, it should be more than 10 million "shi."

㊃

Guangdong Province is originally a rice-deficient area. Someone said: Guangdong Province's annual rice production only provides for the consumption of 30% of the province's population; this is indeed not false. (See the remarks of Central Committee member Deng Qingyang in the Shen Bao of March 16th). Based on the rice shortage in Guangdong Province, and observing the overall number of domestic rice shipments to Guangdong in the past half year; the amount of rice Guangdong Province lacks is still very large. Therefore, the tax-exempt import of foreign rice into Guangdong should be what the people of Guangdong want. However, according to recent reports: domestic rice merchants believe that the surplus rice inventory in the four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui is still more than 10 million "shi," which should be enough to help Guangdong. However, let's analyze the truth about the high rice price in Guangdong Province in the previous section; it can be seen that even if a large amount of domestic rice is shipped to Guangdong, both the people of Guangdong consuming foreign rice and the merchants of Guangdong promoting foreign rice are profitable. If you don't believe it, try to describe it separately as follows:

㊀ Transportation Relationship Someone once calculated that the cost of transporting the same amount of grain for hundreds of miles in China is more expensive than the price of selling food from the United States to China after crossing the Pacific Ocean. Let's try to compare the cost of transporting foreign rice from its place of origin to Shanghai with the cost of transporting domestic rice from Shanghai to Guangdong. Then we can confirm that this statement is not false.

Shipping Costs of Foreign Rice from Various Places to Shanghai

Place of Origin Transport Method Transport Time Transport Cost

Saigon Sea Freight 7 days ▲47 cents per shi

Bangkok Sea Freight 15 days 40 cents

Rangoon Sea Freight 24 days 70 cents

Shipping Costs of Domestic Rice from Shanghai to Guangdong

Place of Arrival Transport Method Transport Time Transport Cost

Shantou Sea Freight 3 days ▲67 cents per shi

Guangzhou Sea Freight 5 days 1.18 yuan

★Hong Kong Sea Freight 4 days 88 cents

▲The unit of transportation cost is calculated per 100 kilograms and per package; now it is converted to "hai hu shi". Each "hai hu shi" is packed into one package.

★Hong Kong has not recently shipped rice from Shanghai, and the recorded freight is based on past times.

From the above table, the transportation cost of foreign rice from overseas to Shanghai is the lowest for Saigon rice, requiring only 47 cents per "shi". If this number is compared with the transportation cost of domestic rice from Shanghai to Guangdong, it is only 39.85%. As for the transportation cost of foreign rice from Bangkok and Rangoon to Shanghai, it is also lower than that of domestic rice from Shanghai to any port in Guangdong. Since the transportation cost of foreign rice from the place of origin to Shanghai is so low; if the transportation cost of foreign rice from the place of origin to various ports in Guangdong Province, it must be even lower than transporting to Shanghai. Under such circumstances of high and low transportation costs, if you only plan from a personal economic perspective, and you are not eating Guangdong rice anyway; then, it is more cost-effective to eat foreign rice than to eat domestic rice with high transportation costs. Therefore, it is no wonder that foreign rice can be sold well in Guangdong Province.

㊁ Currency System Relationship Guangdong Province's currency system has always been extremely complex. Since the central government stipulated the financial policy of reorganizing Guangdong Province last year, the exchange rate between Guangdong currency and "shen chao" (ie legal currency) has been maintained at around plus 5. Under such a high exchange rate of Guangdong currency, Guangdong rice merchants find it extremely difficult to purchase domestic rice. This is because the price of rice and grain in various provinces is based on the standard of legal currency; if the high cost is added to transport it to Guangdong, it is extremely uneconomical in terms of cost. And because of the high exchange rate of Guangdong currency, domestic rice is not easy to sell in Guangdong. Due to this reason of the devaluation of Guangdong currency, the general rice merchants in Guangdong Province tend to follow the path of operating foreign rice. Because most of the foreign rice entering Guangdong comes from Hong Kong for transshipment, although the exchange rate between Guangdong currency and Hong Kong currency is not lower than that of legal currency; but because Guangdong Province has been accustomed to using 20-cent "hao" coins and "hao" foreign currency notes in recent years, the credit of Guangdong currency has fluctuated, and all major transactions in the market are based on the standard of Hong Kong currency. Therefore, habit has become natural. Guangdong rice merchants have to bear the cost of Guangdong currency plus 5 for ordering domestic rice; then there is no difference in foreign exchange for selling foreign rice. The reason why Guangdong merchants promote foreign rice and abandon domestic rice is not unrelated to the currency system of Guangdong currency.

Observing from the above two situations, an extremely large potential force has been created for foreign rice in the food supply of Guangdong Province. Under this circumstance, in the short term, we certainly cannot expect the conditions for Chinese people to eat Chinese rice. However, what is hoped for is that in the key to whether the foreign rice tax should be levied or exempted, we can take care of the essence of the problem. In other words, the levy of foreign rice tax should not cause chaos due to high food prices harming the people; and after the foreign rice tax is exempted, it should not cause the problem of low grain prices harming farmers. What's more, in the era when Chen Jitang was in charge of Guangdong, there was no import tariff on foreign rice. Guangdong Province collected a special tax of one yuan per 100 "jin" of foreign rice. With the huge amount of foreign rice needed in Guangdong Province, it was indeed a large income. Now, the special tax on foreign rice has been abolished, and the administrative unity of tariffs has been maintained, and the customs duty is collected by the customs. How to raise funds for this special tax is an important issue, no less than the food supply issue.

Therefore, from the perspective of the entire food supply issue, since the tax exemption on foreign rice in Guangdong, the national rice price has seen a daily decline, because the loss to farmers is minimal. There are still many benefits to the general livelihood of the people, or it is said that this move is not conducive to merchants; therefore, rice merchants cannot help but argue because their blood capital is involved. However, according to rice merchants' trade, it should be based on the principle of formal sales, and hoarding and profiteering are not suitable for those who operate social commodities. The Central Committee has a plan to adjust the sales of rice merchants, and the purpose is to be in this. According to people in the rice industry: last winter, because various industries made profits, they all hoarded rice. If this is true, then the sacrifice for Guangdong's tax exemption on foreign rice, who caused it?

### City God Marries

— Yan

When I was a child, I went to the countryside with my father to collect rent, and I personally participated in the wedding ceremony of the City God. The solemnity of that ceremony was unprecedented. Almost everyone in the village seemed to be crazy, because eating the wedding wine of the City God could eliminate disasters and bring blessings, and such a grand wedding was also the glory of the whole village. Children naturally like excitement, we did not know the disaster, glory, the City God's wedding was just like watching "village opera", there was only excitement to play; of course, we did not know that the little girl who was paired with the City God's wife would be deprived of happiness for life, living alone in the temple to keep a living widow for her God husband.

This scene of "living drama" is more than twenty years ago, in these more than twenty years it is said that society has made rapid progress, "eliminating superstition", "abolishing old customs" is even sparing no effort to publicize to the public, but unfortunately, the "living drama" of the City God's wedding is still being performed like twenty years ago. Even the repeated prohibition of "welcoming gods and temple fairs" is still "every year around the Qingming Festival, it is always necessary to patrol and hold temple fairs once", so there have also been tragic incidents of large-scale fighting between the two sides, injuring people and bleeding. This kind of "martial spirit" is really not worth learning.

However, progress has indeed been made. The City God also knows the fashion of "free love", so he "dreamed" to the female witch in Yangjing Town, Pudong, saying that he "is still a widower" and "is interested in the deceased daughter of Chen Qiutao, a local who opened a meat shop in the West Market of the town, and wants to marry her as his wife". This is more humane than asking a living little girl to be a "yin and yang couple", so "Chen Qiutao actually regards himself as the father-in-law of the City God, and chooses an auspicious day tomorrow (the 25th) to marry the memorial tablet of his deceased daughter, to complete the marriage with the City God, and in the future, he will sculpt a statue of the Chen Goddess and place it in the temple. In recent days, because the wedding date is approaching, both parties are preparing very busily," it is said. When the reporter is writing, perhaps the Dongjing Temple is full of congratulatory guests, with the sound of flutes and songs, Chen Qiutao is holding the memorial tablet of his deceased daughter and is worshiping heaven and earth with his "son-in-law" the City God, and the female witch who "appointed herself as the matchmaker" must also be wearing a red flower on her hair and deeply congratulating Chen's father-in-law with a blessing.

The people in the countryside are originally busy all year round, suffering to the end, going out to a temple fair once, and playing some tricks such as the City God's wedding to make everyone laugh once is not too much to blame, because "lack of knowledge" cannot be "rich in knowledge" by empty talk. However, the reason why superstition is unbreakable is not in Chen Qiutao and others who "lack knowledge", but in the female witch who "appointed herself as the matchmaker". With these kinds of "yin and yang people", they "fancifully" start dreaming. And "distributing wedding invitations for the City God and receiving congratulatory gifts", the purpose is just like this and that in the end.

Furthermore, it can be seen from the temple fairs and the rituals of purification, etc., that there are "brawny men" who are "making a living from this", so it is known that the story of "the river god marrying a wife" is replayed today.

### Pleasures of Life

— Chen Fu

It is said that China has been unified, and the work of resisting foreign aggression will also begin. The use of newspapers is therefore even more "great". Every day, turning the newspaper, what we are given are all good news, such as the "grand ceremony" of the founding anniversary, the "military music and salute" of the president's return to Beijing, and the "extremely good impression" of the talks, which is really a scene of peace and prosperity. On the 21st, a certain newspaper in Shanghai published a special edition of the "good wedding" of the young masters and young ladies of two celebrities on an entire page.

The special edition starts with an article that elucidates the "true first pleasure of life". It says that in the past, people thought that reading forbidden books behind closed doors on a snowy night was the first pleasure of life, but that was just a temporary pleasure; only the warm spring in the bridal chamber, the beauty of spring like flowers, is really ecstasy, and in the future, a large amount of "production" will be carried out, and ten years of reproduction will be used to relieve the national crisis, and talented men and beautiful women will be followed by loyal ministers and righteous men. This is really endless pleasure, and marriage is the most important. It is said that the readers are fluttering,

However, on careful consideration, I am afraid that it may not be entirely true.

The forbidden books that people read behind closed doors on snowy nights in the past were probably not "materialism", "national disaster records", or the works of Lu Xun and other left-wing writers, but the so-called pornographic books such as "Jin Ping Mei" and "Rou Pu Tuan" that described the "good words and deeds" of talented men and beautiful women more thoroughly, right? Although the Confucian scholars of the past had sex in the same way, it was inevitable that they would be criticized for openly reading pornographic books. The snow night and the lonely lamp, the door is deeply locked, and a volume is in hand, watching the saliva dripping, it is indeed "pleasure". "The revolution was successful", the world changed, "Jin Ping Mei" had already been printed into "rare books" for sale, and some newspapers also have "love novels" to read every day. There was a period when Dr. Zhang Jingsheng compiled "Sexual History", opened a bookstore, and published brilliant advertisements. "The third kind of water" could also be bought from female shop assistants. The taste of forbidden books has long been gone. Now there are "forbidden books", but they must never be touched. Although there is a clear indication of freedom of thought, there is no life once you read forbidden books. On a snowy night behind closed doors, I didn't expect the patrolmen to break in and search through the boxes and cabinets. After rolling their eyes, they shouted, "Go to the line"! And what I watched may be just a "National Salvation Daily". I remember that a young man in Hong Kong suffered a fatal disaster because a red-covered "Call to Arms" was found in his box. Is reading forbidden books today "a pleasure"!

Marriage is happy, but I am afraid that it is also limited to the young masters and young ladies of famous officials and giants. If you are a poor boy, once you get married, it is a lifelong burden, "sleeping next to the husband in the middle of the night, and sleeping next to the debt in the middle of the night". This is a common saying, and it is probably very old, but it is still popular in the same way in ancient and modern times.

"Ten years of reproduction", Goujian used this to restore the country, right. But there is also "ten years of upbringing" below. The famous officials and giants remember the previous sentence, and indulge in the joy of "warm spring in the bridal chamber", compiling numbers to marry concubines, discussing having children, the pleasure is endless, and the production is really rich. When they celebrate their birthday, their children and grandchildren are around their knees, and the guests exclaim and bow their hands, saying "Old brother is really blessed"! Soon the young masters and young ladies can also marry, so they continue the great cause of their ancestors and ancestors from generation to generation. This is indeed quite in line with the ancient Chinese precepts and outlook on life!

The whole family of the Great World jumping off the building to commit suicide is an exception, because they are poor.

Everyone says that the national crisis is serious, and this is of course an absolutely true fact. But how to save ourselves from danger? The aggressor relaxes a little, and we feel that the world is peaceful, and there is a lot to be done in national affairs. This is of course a terrible self-intoxication. Everyone comes to marry, have children, and raise them. If we deduce according to the current situation, it will not take 20 years, I am afraid that we will have suffered the tragedy of national subjugation long ago.

However, marriage is still worth celebrating, let me also wish them "a hundred years of harmony and five generations of prosperity". Because to be able to do so is still "the blessing of the Chinese people".

### A Clam's Song

— Zhuang Ruiyuan

On a summer evening, dense twilight enveloped my room, and the distant window view was also dim. The croaking of frogs, like a sudden rainstorm, painted the fields. The sound seemed so far away and yet so close to the window, my eardrums recounting it anew. The frog song played the tension of daytime farming.

I stood uninhibitedly by the window, listening to this incessant, continuous frog song. I said it was as unlucky as the cawing of crows, and I couldn't help but feel melancholic. Because it made me suspect it was my grandfather's cough, carried from the depths of the house in the middle of the night.

My grandfather, suffering from a chronic hemoptysis, coughed incessantly all day long, especially during the onset of summer. The melancholic tone was so monotonous, continuous. Like a difficult cough that seemed to vomit the heart, and also carrying fine streaks of blood; but, heard vaguely, it made people suspect it was a string of frog songs on a lonely night.

Ah! In a mouthful of yellow phlegm, there were also fine streaks of blood.

## Page 16

"Alas, what is to be done?" Grandmother said blankly beside him, like a doctor wringing her hands. The hearts of the whole family were quietly shrouded in a layer of terrifying shadow, and only a trace of sorrowful smile was squeezed out at the corners of their mouths.

My grandfather, coughing up a little blood due to the cough, was as powerless, limp, and deficient as a pile of withered clothes on the bed. His face was pale and painfully frightening. I really couldn't imagine that the hardships of life could make a person so old, sick, and stop the function of life so easily; but man is essentially an organism after all.

My grandfather once said that his father died in a long, heavy cough. And now, isn't my grandfather, trapped in his dying moments, suffering from the same ailment? Can anyone believe that my grandfather would die in peace and comfort?

Yes, for an old man suffering from such great illness, death is not a destructive disappointment, but a fortunate redemption.

I endured the tragedy in my heart, stood up in pain and sorrow, praying and celebrating for my grandfather's death. My celebration of death was an atrocity, an atrocity that was indeed innocent, and I felt that I was in a practice of compassion.

There should be no complaints, all this is due to the hard work for survival. When a person reaches the end of life, even if there is room to look back and marvel at the footprints he has left, he will ultimately not regret the fall and lying still in rest.

So, when I saw plain-colored mourning clothes, lacquered coffins, and things like paper money for the underworld, I didn't feel any sadness, just a sense of terror. What a mediocre destruction, and what a fortunate redemption.

But when I listen to the continuous frog songs on a summer night, I can't help but feel melancholy, and say that it is as unlucky as the cawing of crows, because it imitates my grandfather's cough coming from the depths of the house in the middle of the night.

This cough is a cry of suffering, which sets an uneven tone on the strings of life, playing incessantly. In the tone, there is the complaint of the sufferer. The frog plays a funeral song for those who have fallen due to the corrosion of life.

### Starting from "Assisting Ms. Bai Wei"

— Cheng Mei

I recently saw an article in a certain newspaper about assisting Ms. Bai Wei, which stated:

"Recently, I heard that the female writer Ms. Bai Wei has fallen ill. It goes without saying that she needs medicine when she is sick, but she is not only sick but also poor: not only does she not have money to buy medicine, but it is said that she cannot even pay the rent. A famous female writer, living such a miserable life, requires us to find a way to help after sighing with emotion."

Indeed, a famous female writer, not only sick and unable to afford medicine, but also unable to pay the rent, and needing others to find a way to help after sighing with emotion, truly makes us sigh with emotion. Therefore, I also remember seeing in a certain magazine the article "Remembering My Deceased Friend Lu Xun", which described the reason for Mr. Lu Xun's death, which stated:

"(3) Economic hardship: His life depended only on royalties and the income from selling manuscripts. All expenses for supporting his family, helping friends, and purchasing and publishing books came from this. However, royalties were difficult to collect, and selling manuscripts was also difficult... I later realized that the reason why he did not ask a D doctor for a prescription when he was seriously ill, and why he did not go elsewhere for recuperation after he was seriously ill, and always hesitated about when to go and where to go, was mostly because of this economic pressure."

Mr. Lu Xun can be said to be the authority in the Chinese literary world, but because of economic pressure, he did not ask a D doctor for a prescription when he was seriously ill, and he did not go elsewhere for recuperation after he was seriously ill. Compared with foreign writers, it is really too sigh-worthy.

But on the other hand, we can also see some bookstore owners in Shanghai who are good at catering and speculation, because there is an undeniable fact: Although the creation of new literature has laid its foundation since the May Fourth Movement, its readers are still limited to the so-called petty intellectuals... This fact has made the circulation of new literary creations pitiable, with an average of no more than three thousand copies printed, while "Investiture of the Gods" and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" are printed unceasingly, and "Jianghu Qi Xia Zhuan" and "A Comical Marriage" have sold hundreds of thousands of copies. Therefore, our bookstore owners, "in order to send literature into the minds of the entire public," can also be regarded as serving the cultural world loyally, believing that the best way to seize the majority of backward readers with new literary creations is to print them in a discounted book format. Therefore, they compile and select literary anthologies, publish selections of famous writers, and so far I have seen many kinds of "XXX Selected Works", "XXX Creative Selections", "XXX Novel Selections", "XXX Literary Selections" and so on, which loyally serve the culture and "send literature into the minds of the entire public". The titles are numerous, and although the forms are different, the content is just a change of soup without changing the medicine, generally the same, which can be said to be "amazing"!

Also, I saw a short essay in the Li Bao and Guangming Daily, mentioning that a reader bought a "Debate on National Defense Literature" and also bought a "Debate on Literature at the Present Stage", and found that the articles collected in the two books were exactly the same, and could not help but feel the pain of being deceived deeply. This makes people think of the many poor and light-seeking young friends in the mainland, wasting their money stained with blood and sweat so many times, and the feelings in their hearts feel more than just anger.

After seeing the work done by these bookstore owners on behalf of them, our writers can only "suffer from the difficulty in collecting royalties." Therefore, writers who "rely solely on royalties and the income from selling manuscripts" can only not ask a D doctor for a prescription when they are seriously ill, and can only not go elsewhere for recuperation after they are seriously ill. And what about some? Not only do they not have money to buy medicine when they are sick, but they can't even pay the rent!

The writers who receive this kind of gift are not only Mr. Lu Xun and Ms. Bai Wei, and the readers who receive this kind of gift are not only the reader mentioned above. Therefore, for writers, it is not only a matter of "needing us to find a way to help after sighing with emotion", and for readers, it is not only a matter of "just sighing in vain".
