### Sichuan Disaster Relief Bond's Fundraising Method is Unsuitable

Ministry of Finance Telegraphed Liu Xiang Yesterday to Properly Plan; Zhu Qinglan Telegraphed Beijing to Report on Disaster

[Nanjing] The central government attaches great importance to the drought in Sichuan Province. Before Minister Kong went abroad, he ordered the National Treasury to allocate 1 million yuan in public bonds to the Relief Committee, with Chairman Zhu Qinglan and Ministry of Finance Commissioner Cao Zhongzhi going to Sichuan to supervise the distribution. Recently, Sichuan Chairman Liu Xiang telegraphed the Executive Yuan to request the issuance of 15 million yuan in Sichuan Provincial Disaster Relief Bonds. The Executive Yuan instructed the Ministry of Finance to discuss and respond. The Ministry of Finance has responded to the Executive Yuan and telegraphed Liu Xiang on the 27th, saying: (excerpt) The Executive Yuan has entrusted the examination and discussion of the case of your Chairman's telegraph requesting the issuance of disaster relief bonds. The Sichuan disaster mentioned in the original telegram is indeed severe, and the central government should strive to provide relief. Your request to issue Sichuan Provincial Disaster Relief Bonds is indeed feasible. However, the two fundraising methods proposed in the original telegram are not very appropriate. (excerpt) This year's disaster-stricken provinces, such as Henan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Guangxi, have repeatedly telegraphed for help, and public bonds and cash have been allocated for relief. Sichuan Province has also allocated 1 million yuan in public bonds to the Relief Committee to send commissioners to distribute, which is more than other provinces. The disaster relief reserve fund listed in the central budget has long been spent. Since your Chairman considers the Sichuan disaster to be severe and requests the issuance of Sichuan Provincial Disaster Relief Bonds as a way to raise a large amount of relief funds, the funds you refer to are all national taxes, which is inconsistent with the principle of issuing provincial disaster bonds. According to regulations, a disaster relief reserve fund should be listed in budgets at all levels, which has long been implemented. If Sichuan Province needs to issue disaster relief bonds, this reserve fund should be used as the fundraising fund for issuing the bonds, which is the proper method. Even if the amount of the reserve fund is slightly insufficient, please ask the central government to provide assistance from the disaster relief reserve fund. According to Director Liu Hangchen of the Finance Department, the method of issuing Sichuan Provincial Disaster Relief Bonds is still consistent with this purpose. Director Liu has now returned to Sichuan. Please properly formulate a plan and submit it to the Executive Yuan for review. Given the severe situation of the Sichuan disaster, the Ministry will be happy to assist to the best of its ability. In addition to submitting a report to the Executive Yuan and sending a letter to the Relief Committee, this telegraph is sent to you first. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th)

[Chengdu] Regarding Liu Xiang's previous telegram requesting the central government to issue 15 million yuan in Sichuan Disaster Relief Bonds, the Executive Yuan has sent it to the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Industry, and the Relief Committee for review at a meeting on the 29th. The Rong News Association and various newspapers telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry on the 27th, requesting that the Executive Yuan approve Liu's request in order to save the people from disaster. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th)

[Chengdu] Zhu Qinglan telegraphed Beijing on the 27th, saying: "I have visited Chongqing and Chengdu, and what I have heard and seen is that the disaster situation is unprecedented in a century. I have reviewed the disaster situation in detail and distributed the funds, totaling 2 million yuan from the central government and the province. I have selected and properly trained the relief personnel. I will first assign them to the 26 counties with the most severe disasters and the 46 counties with slightly less severe disasters. The relief commissioners will go to the disaster areas immediately to check households, issue tickets, and distribute emergency relief. The Executive Yuan has sent a commissioner, Hong San, to supervise the distribution of the relief funds, who will arrive in Sichuan from Kangding within days to earnestly supervise the distribution. The Ministry of Finance has sent Inspector Cao to inspect and distribute funds in various areas. Emergency relief is only a temporary solution, and the disaster is widespread, so the relief is limited. The fundamental solution lies in agriculture and sericulture. I hope that the Bureau of Agricultural Credit will be instructed to come to Sichuan quickly to handle agricultural loans, raise funds, develop various sources of profit, and reduce various harsh taxes to relieve the people's burden and help them recover. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th)

[Chengdu] The central government's investigation and distribution of emergency relief funds for the Sichuan disaster, carried out by Zhu Qinglan, Cao Zhongzhi, and others who came to Sichuan, agreed on concrete measures with Liu Xiang and local gentry, divided into three routes to investigate the disaster, and determined 26 counties with severe disasters and 46 counties with less severe disasters, and distributed funds in advance. The heads of each investigation team will personally go to the disaster areas to issue tickets to each household. For the counties with lighter disasters, they will raise funds for work relief and agricultural loans to provide relief. Zhu is scheduled to fly from Rong to Lanzhou on the 29th to inspect the Gansu disaster. Cao Zhongzhi will also lead the investigation and distribution personnel to set off on the same day to investigate the disaster and distribute funds. Commissioner Hong San, a Dharma master supervising the distribution, will set off from Kangding on the 28th and is expected to arrive in Rong on May 8th. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th)

Current Commentary

### Congratulations on the Inauguration of the Sino-US Scheduled Air Route

— Appropriate

The scheduled direct air service between China and the United States, after two trial flights, is now officially launched. The China Clipper, a large flying boat of Pan American Airways, carrying a large batch of mail on its first westbound flight, took off from San Francisco on the 21st of this month and arrived in Manila yesterday, transferring the mail to the Hong Kong Clipper, which is scheduled to fly to Hong Kong today. The Sikorsky aircraft of the China National Aviation Corporation, carrying 300 kilograms of mail on its first eastbound flight, took off from Shanghai yesterday morning and arrived in Hong Kong on the same day, connecting with the Hong Kong Clipper's flight, transferring the eastbound mail and picking up the westbound mail. From now on, the Sino-US air route will operate once a week. In addition to carrying mail, it will also carry passengers. The establishment of this scheduled air route can reduce the travel time between China and the United States by two-thirds. If night flight facilities are added in the future, the flight time of 10,000 miles for the entire route can be further reduced from seven days to three or four days, which is also foreseeable. This surprising new page in the history of world transportation has now been unveiled.

The establishment of the Sino-US scheduled air service not only represents a new advance in international transportation but also has a more important significance in terms of the international situation in the world, especially in the Far East. The opening of this Pacific air trunk line has a history of six years. In the autumn of 1931, Colonel Lindbergh made a trans-Pacific flight and discovered the possibility of building this route. Subsequently, the American side went through countless difficulties and setbacks in surveying and establishing stations, expending enormous financial and human resources, before achieving today's success. According to experts, opening a trans-Atlantic air route is much easier than opening a trans-Pacific air route. However, the U.S. government has chosen the more difficult path and created this route first. From this, we can easily see the U.S. government's special and earnest concern for the Far East and for China.

Sino-US aviation was established through the friendly cooperation of China, Britain, and the United States. It goes without saying that after the opening of the air service, it will further consolidate the friendship and connection between the three countries. Moreover, this route passes through Hong Kong, which is now the international hub for aviation between China, the United States, and Britain. The Eurasia Aviation Corporation is currently planning an air route from Beiping via Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, Hankou, and Changsha directly to Hong Kong. The Southwest Aviation Corporation is also preparing to extend its air route to Hong Kong. When these two routes are connected, undoubtedly, the relationship between major cities across our country and Britain and the United States will become even closer.

Precisely because of this, the establishment of Sino-US scheduled aviation has attracted great attention from the Japanese side. Japan is expanding its power on the mainland, and it inevitably poses a considerable threat to the interests of Britain and the United States in the Far East. Now that they have seen such a situation, they will certainly not show weakness. Just half a month ago, the Kamikaze aircraft of the Japanese Asahi Shimbun boasted to the world with a record-breaking flight to Europe. This may not have been accidental.

However, we love world peace. We do not want the opening of the Sino-US scheduled air service to sharpen the opposing forces between countries. We would like to quote a word from Wang Xiaolai, a representative of the Sino-US Trade Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, to congratulate the success of the Sino-US air service: "This most advanced air route is solely for the development of peaceful undertakings and will be sufficient to guarantee peace in the Pacific in the future."

### Special Envoy Kong Arrives in Europe

### British Parliament Discusses Tung Oil Control

[London] Conservative MP Churton asked in the House of Commons today about the China Vegetable Oil Company. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranborne replied that Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, had submitted a report to the Department on this matter. The control of this company seems to be in the hands of the Chinese government. As far as can be ascertained at present, the policy of this company is that, when the necessary organizations can be formed, this company will be able to undertake the sale of tung oil.

### Britain and Belgium Discuss the Future of the European Situation with Germany and Italy

West European Treaty and Economy are the Main Themes Italy and Germany Urgently Seek Mutual Assistance Due to Lack of Raw Materials

[London] Important diplomatic talks were held simultaneously in the capitals of two European countries today, one in Brussels, Belgium, and the other in Rome, Italy. General Goering, a confidant of Hitler, exchanged views with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Rome this morning for nearly three hours, and then met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini for about 40 minutes in the afternoon. Goering's visit to Italy is rumored to be of a private nature, but according to those who know the details, he and the Italian authorities discussed important issues such as the Spanish issue and Germany's four-year economic self-sufficiency plan. Furthermore, both Germany and Italy now feel a lack of raw materials and are trying to find ways to combine and share raw materials to seek mutual assistance. On the Belgian side, British Foreign Secretary Eden met with Belgian Prime Minister Janson and Foreign Minister Spaak at the Prime Minister's Office for two hours this morning. After lunch, Eden and Janson continued their meeting at the British Embassy. Eden is also scheduled to meet with Spaak alone tomorrow morning, and then hold a joint talk with Janson and Spaak. It is noted that Eden's visit to Belgium comes after Britain and France jointly issued a declaration lifting Belgium's obligations as a guarantor state of the Locarno Treaty. Therefore, the talks are likely to focus on the future of the West European Treaty negotiations and the progress of the economic investigation proposed by Britain and France. According to today's London Times, the joint British-French declaration has expanded the path for peaceful development in Western Europe. The declaration itself is clear and powerful, but it does not retain any restrictions on a larger organization to ensure Western Europe. Furthermore, from Belgium's own point of view, it can strengthen its independence in all aspects to make a powerful cooperation in the general political and economic reconciliation. Otherwise, Belgium and other countries will find it difficult to obtain a guarantee of true peace. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 26th)

### Belgium's Delicate Position in the West European Treaty

Britain and Belgium Reach Consensus Will Also Make Germany Guarantee Belgium's Security

⊙ Brussels British Foreign Secretary Eden held a final talk with Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak at 10:30 this morning for 45 minutes. The official communiqué was released at 12:45 stating that Foreign Secretary Eden had held repeated talks with Prime Minister Janson and Foreign Minister Spaak. The main issues discussed were: (1) the issue of European peace, especially the future of the West European Security Treaty, (2) the economic investigation work to be carried out by Prime Minister Janson. The talks were not formal negotiations but an exchange of views in a friendly atmosphere, but it has proved that both sides are in complete agreement. Foreign Secretary Eden left the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:15 AM and went to Prime Minister Janson's villa in the suburbs, where the Prime Minister hosted a banquet, with many important figures from Britain and Belgium in attendance. After the meal, Eden also met with the French Ambassador to Belgium, Laroche. It is reported that he is scheduled to return to London by plane at 4:30 this afternoon. Ambassador Laroche plans to visit Prime Minister Janson for a talk this afternoon. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 27th)

⊙ Brussels British Foreign Secretary Eden and Prime Minister Janson recently held a final meeting at the British Embassy. It is estimated that the talks between Britain and Belgium will end this evening. Officials are now keeping silent about the results of the talks, but it is heard that Eden, Janson, and Foreign Minister Spaak have agreed that when the West European Security Treaty is formally signed in the future, Belgium should take an important stance in the treaty and should also find ways within the West European Security Treaty framework to make Germany guarantee Belgium's security. At this point, the governments of Britain, France, and Belgium should prepare for the signing of the West European Security Treaty through diplomatic channels. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 26th)

[London] According to the foreign affairs correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, who accompanied Foreign Secretary Eden to Brussels, the newspaper claimed today that both sides were very satisfied with the Brussels meeting and do not intend to exchange views any further. Belgium does not want to be hasty about concluding a new security treaty to replace the Locarno Treaty. The original plan to draft a separate agreement on Belgian independence has been abandoned, and the focus is on the West European Treaty to determine Belgium's new status. (Kuomintang Seafarers Telegraph on the 27th)

⊙ Brussels After British Foreign Secretary Eden and Belgian Prime Minister Janson and Foreign Minister Spaak reached a compromise, it is generally believed that the results of Foreign Secretary Eden's trip were very important. Therefore, the Belgian government will not conduct direct negotiations with Germany, but will wait and see for the time being. At the same time, it will also require Germany to guarantee the security of Belgian territory under the future West European Treaty framework, just as Britain and France do. It is especially feared that if negotiations for such a treaty take too long, the movement that previously occurred in Belgium, which caused the government to break away from the obligations stipulated in the Locarno Treaty, may reappear. The Belgian government may be forced to conduct separate negotiations with Germany. However, if Germany wants to conduct such negotiations, it must abandon its demand for Belgium to restore its absolute neutrality before the European War. Otherwise, if the Belgian government accepts this demand, its troops can only be used to defend the territory and cannot interfere in other wars, which is contrary to the obligations stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, which the country is unwilling to hear. In short, the evolution of the situation depends on Germany's goodwill. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 27th)

[London] According to general observers, some representatives of the British overseas autonomous territories have expressed dissent regarding the declaration issued by the British and French governments on Belgium the other day. In particular, this declaration both lifted Belgium's obligations as a guarantor and, on the other hand, Britain and France still maintain the mutual assistance agreement signed by the two countries' general staffs. This mutual assistance agreement is tantamount to a treaty of alliance and risks drawing Britain into the vortex of continental Europe. Therefore, some autonomous territory representatives have expressed their opposition. However, it is generally believed that the British government's insistence on maintaining the mutual assistance agreement between the British and French general staffs is based on the following reasons: (1) The 1935 British overseas autonomous territory conference recognized that Britain had an important interest in protecting the Rhine River border. However, in order to ensure the security of the borders of the countries along the Rhine River, the mutual assistance agreement between Britain and France is essential. (2) The mutual assistance clauses of the British-French general staff agreement are open, and all other signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty are free to join. (3) Germany and Italy's failure to participate in this mutual assistance agreement is due to the two countries' own volition, not to the deliberate exclusion by Britain and France. In addition, responsible political figures believe that the mutual assistance agreement between the British and French general staffs is an element of British foreign policy. This foreign policy is only directly related to Britain and does not cause the responsibility of the entire British Empire. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 26th)

[London] Regarding the future world conference, British Under-Secretary of State Cranborne stated in the House of Commons today that before taking steps to convene a future world conference, Britain must first begin with a detailed and complete investigation to see if there is any hope of success in the future. Crane also said that the British and French governments have recently asked Belgian Prime Minister Janson to first conduct an informal investigation into whether the obstacles to international trade can be relaxed. Zhan Lin has now agreed to the British and French request. Therefore, before convening the World Congress, Janson's report must first be obtained. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 26th)

[Paris] The Little Parisian Newspaper today published a speech by U.S. Secretary of State Hull, vehemently opposing economic restrictions and military expansion, and advocating that all countries in the world cooperate to transform the entire international relationship.

### Foundations of the Military Alliance Between Italy and Germany Nearing Completion

Mussolini to Visit Germany in September - Cautious on the Spanish Question

[Rome] Following a conversation between German Aviation Minister General Göring and Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday, responsible figures here have announced that Mussolini and Hitler have decided to meet in Germany at the end of September this year. The Prime Minister's visit to Germany is thus confirmed. Furthermore, General Göring and the Prime Minister discussed the current situation in Spain. Observers believe that Italy and Germany will adopt a more cautious attitude towards the Spanish Civil War in the future. (Havas News Agency, Rome, 27th)

[Rome] Diplomatic circles here today believe that Italy and Germany may conclude a military alliance. It is said that after a three-hour meeting between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Aviation Minister and Prussian Prime Minister General Göring today, the groundwork has been completed. If this alliance can be established, its power will be comparable to the Franco-Russian alliance. It is also learned that Göring has arranged with Mussolini for the latter to visit Hitler in Germany. However, the German side stated that Mussolini's trip would not be realized in the short term and may have to wait until mid-autumn. Another source said that Mussolini will fly to the capitals of Germany, Hungary, and Austria in mid-June. In addition, the meeting between Mussolini and Göring mainly discussed the current situation in Spain, the newly established compromise between Italy and Austria, and industrial cooperation between Italy and Germany. If the industries of the two countries can unite and exchange registration rights, produce artificial goods separately, and set product standards, then the two countries will be self-sufficient in the event of war, which is beneficial to both parties in terms of national defense. (National News Agency, 26th)

[Rome] German Aviation Minister Göring arrived here this morning from southern Italy and first held talks with Foreign Minister Count Ciano. Then, at 5:00 p.m., he was received by Prime Minister Mussolini. General Göring is scheduled to leave here tomorrow morning to tour various cities in Italy for a week. In addition, Foreign Minister Ciano met with German Ambassador Hassel, Hungarian Minister Willani, and the Yugoslav Chargé d'Affaires today for discussions. (Havas News Agency, Rome, 26th)

### First Major Naval Battle in Spain

Ships Endured for a Long Time Without Damage - Rebel Forces Achieve Successive Victories in the North - Ancient Basque Capital Completely Destroyed

⊙Valencia: The warships of the Spanish government forces and the Nationalist forces have engaged in their first major naval battle, but neither side suffered any losses. On Saturday and Sunday, the government cruisers Libertad and Mendez Nuñez, and five destroyers, fired on the coast near Malaga. Nationalist planes immediately responded, but one Nationalist plane was shot down. Soon, Nationalist torpedo boats attacked the government warships, and Nationalist warships Canarias and Baleares also came to their aid. They endured for a long time, but all were safe and sound. (Reuters, Valencia, 26th)

⊙Bilbao: The ancient Basque town of Guernica has been completely destroyed due to bombing by the Nationalist air force. The air raid lasted for a total of three and a half hours, with bombs raining down continuously. Hundreds of civilians died, and the city is still burning. It is said that the Nationalist planes were manufactured in Germany. The enemy planes dropped over a thousand high-explosive bombs and countless incendiary bombs and hand grenades. Many women and children died. Hundreds of residents fled to the fields outside the town, but the enemy planes chased them with machine guns. After the enemy planes destroyed the entire town and flew away, fire brigades and rescue teams came to the rescue but could not find a way to start. The entire town is now engulfed in flames. Most of the streets are filled with huge holes caused by bombs, and rubble from destroyed houses is piled up everywhere, making it impossible to pass. Fifty women and children were trapped in bomb shelters, and after the fire started, there was no way to escape, and they all became ashes. The surviving residents wandered in the streets, searching for their missing relatives. Their situation was extremely tragic. Many of them are now packing up their belongings and sleeping in the open, waiting for the Basque government to order them to evacuate the town. The roads leading to the town are now filled with walking farmers, and trucks are constantly traveling back and forth. Basque government officials have visited the town to inspect it. The crumbling walls in the town are in danger of collapsing at any time, so rescue work is particularly dangerous. (Reuters, Bilbao, 27th)

⊙Bilbao: After holding an emergency meeting today, the government authorities immediately ordered a counterattack to try to reverse the crisis. (National News Agency, 26th)

⊙Vitoria: After capturing the city of Elorrio yesterday, the troops of General Mola, commander of the Nationalist forces in the north, took advantage of their victory to advance and captured the cities of Durango and Eibar one after another this morning. The government forces are now retreating in a panic along the road between Durango and Bilbao, and it is said that they are taking many hostages with them. (Havas News Agency, Vitoria, 26th)

⊙Hendaye: The Basque authorities have today asked the foreign diplomatic representatives currently in Saint-Jean-de-Luz to contact the rebels to discuss the surrender conditions of Bilbao. (National News Agency, 27th)

⊙Hendaye: It is reported that the troops of General Mola, commander of the Nationalist forces in the north, have occupied Eibar, 51 miles east of Bilbao, and Durango, 18 miles southeast. At the same time, General Mola broadcast a warning to the residents of Bilbao, urging them to surrender quickly to avoid the destruction of the entire city. It is learned that the 340,000 residents of the city have requested the foreign diplomatic representatives here to contact the Basque government to discuss surrender conditions. Basque government Prime Minister Aguirre and his subordinates held an emergency meeting yesterday and ordered the Defense Committee to be fully responsible for military affairs in the Bilbao area. The committee immediately reorganized the militia into small guerrilla units. (National News Agency, 26th)

### Rebellion Within the Rebel Army

Authorities Maintain Strict Secrecy

⊙Gibraltar: The Nationalist authorities in southern Spain are extremely strict in monitoring travelers from Spain to Gibraltar. This afternoon, a passenger from Seville confirmed that a rebellion had recently occurred within the Nationalist army in Granada province in southern Spain. However, because the authorities are keeping it secret and strictly checking incoming and outgoing letters and telegrams, the details are unknown. Furthermore, foreign journalists who want to go to La Línea are being prevented from entering by the local authorities. (Havas News Agency, Gibraltar, 26th)

⊙Burgos: The leader of the Nationalist government, Franco, has recently ordered that the Roman salute be the official salute in the Nationalist-controlled areas. (Havas News Agency, Burgos, 26th)

### Non-Intervention Committee Discusses Withdrawal of Volunteers

Principle Approved but Implementation Difficult - British Warship Clashes with Rebel Warship

[London] The Military Experts Committee of the Adjustment Committee on Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War held a meeting this morning to discuss the withdrawal of volunteers from various countries in Spain. It was unanimously agreed in principle to withdraw the volunteers, but there are many difficulties in implementing this matter. French expert General Le Long proposed that an investigation team from the Adjustment Committee go to Spain to contact both sides of the civil war and study whether it is possible to investigate the exact number of foreign volunteers on the spot. The committee then decided that the experts of each country should first consult their respective governments on this proposal, and only after obtaining the approval of their respective governments should they submit it to both sides of the Spanish civil war. Regarding the issue of the withdrawal of volunteers, it is generally known that the Spanish Republican government has accepted it in principle, but argues that the Moroccan native soldiers who are currently assisting the Nationalist army should also be regarded as foreigners, which the Nationalist side naturally opposes. Furthermore, if the above-mentioned proposal of the Spanish Republican government is accepted, it will set a precedent for the European military system, and those who oppose the use of colonial troops in European wars will have a strong argument. Even on this level, Germany may support the Spanish Republican government's proposal, while France may even support the Nationalist side's point of view. (Havas News Agency, London, 26th)

[London] A new dispute has occurred today between a British warship and a Spanish Nationalist warship. A British ship carrying coal to Spain was stopped by the Spanish Nationalist warship Admiral Cervera six miles off the Spanish coast. The British warship HMS Shropshire intervened. The two sides exchanged telegrams, but the British warship insisted that it did not recognize the Spanish Nationalist forces' right to interfere with the actions of foreign ships outside the three-mile territorial waters. Admiral Cervera finally left. (Reuters, London, 26th)

⊙Gibraltar: The British cargo ship Great Hopes, which loaded oranges from the Spanish port of Valencia a few days ago and sailed here, set sail last night for Antwerp, Belgium. After sailing out of the Strait of Gibraltar, several Spanish Nationalist armed fishing boats tried to interrogate it, so the ship returned to this port and reported it to the British naval authorities. (Havas News Agency, Gibraltar, 27th)

[London] According to a report from Gibraltar, General Lano, commander of the Nationalist forces in southern Spain, made a declaration in Seville, launching a fierce attack on Britain. He said that since the last war, Britain has gradually lost its original prestige, and if the Spanish Nationalist forces win, Britain will be on the verge of collapse and will not recover. Congressional figures here commented that the British navy's recent protection of its own merchant ships in the northern Spanish waters has angered the Nationalist authorities, so they made this impudent remark. It would be ridiculous to see it as containing any important political significance. As for the British merchant ships transporting food and coal to Bilbao to supply the autonomous Basque government, the British government's attitude has been approved by most members of Congress. Only a small number of extreme right-wing elements feel that Britain may eventually sympathize with the Spanish government forces and therefore express their opposition, but this is only a very small number. In addition, official sources have repeatedly stated that the cabinet meeting on the 11th of this month, although it recognized that the waters around Bilbao had become a dangerous area and advised British merchant ships not to enter the port, Britain did not legally recognize the Nationalist forces' blockade of Bilbao. The British navy will continue to protect its own merchant ships, but only on the high seas. From the British government's point of view, territorial waters should be limited to three miles from the coast, and Britain cannot recognize the Nationalist forces' claim that territorial waters extend to six miles from the coast. (Havas News Agency, London, 26th)

### Germany Experiences a Severe Shortage of Raw Materials

Steel is Particularly in Short Supply - Military Preparations Affected

[Berlin] German industrialists, especially those related to national military preparations, are experiencing a shortage of raw materials. Steel is particularly in short supply. This matter is particularly related to Hitler and Göring's construction plans. Since Britain announced its policy of military buildup, the world's steel and iron ore have been almost completely bought up, which has had an extremely unfavorable impact on Germany's military preparations and four-year construction program. Furthermore, countries around the world are paying cash for raw materials, while Germany, due to a shortage of foreign currency, must negotiate commodity exchange terms with them, which is also a reason why it is difficult for Germany to increase iron ore imports. It is said that Germany imported only 2.73 million tons of iron ore in January and February of this year, while it imported 3.08 million tons in the same period last year. Since raw materials are in short supply, the number of workers cannot be reduced, for fear of causing major unemployment problems in the country. Therefore, the country's heavy industries have entered a dilemma. In addition, other emerging industries cannot be built due to the shortage of steel. Even the construction of the city centers of Berlin and Munich, which Hitler has repeatedly declared, cannot be carried out. (Reuters, Berlin, 26th)

### Japanese Navy Plans Three Supplementary Programs

The Sole Purpose is to Dominate East Asia

[Tokyo] The Navy is implementing the Third Supplementary Program and preparing ships and weapons to improve the quality of personnel, realizing the elements of expanding outstanding people, and still based on the spirit of non-threatening and non-aggressive, in order to complete its minimum autonomous military preparations. Next month, on Navy Day, a booklet will be issued entitled "The Treaty-Free Era and the Japanese Navy," the general situation of which is as follows:

㊀ The Imperial Navy: The new supplementary program built this year is purely out of a spirit of self-defense and does not induce other countries to compete in shipbuilding. It is still based on the spirit of non-threatening and non-aggressive advocated in the past, but at the same time, it is completely in a unique position, based on national conditions, and must prepare military equipment suitable for national character and most effective. ㊁ In the East, the Empire's position depends on the stability of East Asia. All matters relating to the life and death of the Empire, the nation, etc., are absolutely imperative. Therefore, the Empire's national defense forces must have the strength to resist any country's attempt to disturb the stability of East Asia. That is, the Empire's naval power in the Pacific must have the power to defeat any invading country's fleet, and it must possess unparalleled elite content. ㊂ In view of the Empire's geographical situation in the East, it is possible to control the sea in the East, and it is not impossible to utilize all geographical advantages and expect the consolidation of national defense. Therefore, this program must be equipped with the essential minimum military force to complete its energy. (Domei News Agency, 27th)

### Overview of Soviet News Undertakings

About 10,000 Kinds of Newspapers Nationwide - Daily Sales of 38 Million Copies

[Moscow] In 1936, the Soviet Union published about 10,000 kinds of newspapers, with daily sales of 38 million copies. Compared with 1913, the number of newspaper types increased by more than 11 times, and daily sales increased by 13 and a half times. In recent years, the news network has expanded particularly rapidly. Not only in the central areas of each district, but also in the various machine traction stations, state-owned farms, and railway warehouses, newspapers are published. Central newspapers account for about a quarter of the total sales of newspapers nationwide. The sales of major newspapers in the country have kept pace with the world's largest newspapers. For example, last year, Pravda sold 1.9 million copies, Izvestia of the Central Executive Committee sold 1.6 million copies, and Peasant News sold 1.75 million copies. The newspaper industry in the capitals and central areas of various ethnic republics is also developing rapidly. At the beginning of last year, there were a total of 2,900 types of district newspapers, with total sales of about 9 million copies, but by the end of last year, the number had increased to 3,400 types, with daily sales of 11 million copies. The increase in ethnic newspapers is particularly rapid. In 1929, Turkmenistan had only 5 types of newspapers, with daily printing of 25,000 copies, but by 1936, the number had increased to 42 types, with daily sales of 177,000 copies. Eight years ago, Tajikistan had only 2 types of newspapers, selling 68,000 copies, but now it has 55 types, with daily sales of 138,000 copies. The number of newspapers in Kalmykia increased from 3 to 36, Uzbekistan from 17 to 190, Belarus from 17 to 205, and Georgia from 20 to 143. In 1928, the Soviet Union had 47 types of newspapers in various languages, which increased to 68 types last year. Last year, the construction expenditure of printing houses and publishing houses exceeded 53 million rubles. This year, the daily sales of newspapers nationwide should increase to 39 million copies. The production of newsprint will increase by 13 percent, and printing machines will increase significantly, all of which are made in the Soviet Union, with a total value of over 45 million rubles.

### British Government Issues National Defense Bonds

Total Amount of £100 Million to be Offered for Sale Tomorrow

[London] Today, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons that the government intends to issue £100 million in national defense bonds, offered at 99.5, with an annual interest rate of 2.5%. These bonds are short-term and medium-term bonds, which will be redeemed by lottery at face value before the end of 1948, with at least 20% of the total amount each time. The first lottery will be held in the autumn of 1944, and the first interest payment date will be September 15 this year. Small retail buyers of bonds can contact post offices and trustee savings banks. It is learned that detailed regulations will be announced in newspaper advertisements this Wednesday, and sales will begin on Thursday. Before the funds raised are used for defense spending, they will be used to reduce existing short-term bonds and repay £80 million in temporarily diverted budget expenses. According to keen observers, the prospects for this bond issuance are extremely optimistic, and subscribers will be enthusiastic, as the maturity date is very convenient for insurance companies, and the operation is also very convenient between short-term and long-term.

### Shandong Province Actively Plans to Build Roads to Transport Coal

Select Sites for Iron Ore Mining and Steelmaking

Jinan Correspondence: Shandong Provincial Industrial Company is a joint venture between officials and merchants, raising 20 million yuan to develop various industries in the province. The first project to be tried is the Huabao Coal Mine in Tai'an. The mine has good quality and extremely rich deposits, so it has the greatest hope. However, it is too far from the railway line and transportation is difficult. Therefore, it is actively planning to build a railway to seek development. From the mine to Qiyao Station on the Jinpu Railway is about 40 miles. If a railway is built to transport coal to Shanghai and other places (Shanghai coal merchants are paying close attention to this and have sent personnel to Shandong to investigate and negotiate), it will not be difficult. Shandong Provincial Chairman Han Fuju sent a letter to Jinpu Railway Director Yang Chengxun to discuss this matter. Yang replied that the railway would be built by the railway bureau. A few days ago, when Han went south to Beijing and Hangzhou to meet Jiang, he met Yang Chengxun and urged him in person. Yang immediately sent personnel to survey, but there is still no news. The provincial government is worried that the Jinpu Railway Bureau will be slow to proceed, so it plans to build the railway itself. Director of the Construction Department Zhang Honglie went to Qingdao from Jinan the day before yesterday to meet Ge Guangting, chairman of the Jiaoji Railway, to discuss purchasing old steel rails from the railway. Yu Wuheng, a technician of the Construction Department and director of the Huabao Coal Mine Management Office, plans to go to Beijing after Zhang returns to Jinan to discuss with the Jinpu Railway Bureau again. If the railway decides to build the branch line, it should start construction as soon as possible. Otherwise, the province will build the railway itself and contact the railway to purchase materials. If the steel rails from the Jiaoji Railway, Jinpu Railway, and Hanzhan Railway cannot be purchased, then he will go to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to negotiate. It is said that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has 25-pound rails, which can carry 15-ton cars, and the Jiaoji Railway has 65-pound rails, which can carry 24-ton cars. The Jinpu Railway has 65-pound rails and 85-pound rails. The heavier the rail, the more weight it can carry. According to calculations, the 40 miles from the Huabao Mine to Qiyao Station will require about 1,000 tons of 35-pound rails and about 1,700 to 800 tons of 65-pound rails. In short, the material aspect is no longer a problem, and the construction cost is about 800,000 yuan, which will be allocated from the company's 5 million yuan fund. After completion, it will be operated by the Industrial Company.

This year, the great powers are actively expanding their military equipment, and the need for steel has increased sharply, and the value has soared. The value of steel, which was 120 or 130 yuan per ton a year ago, has now risen to 240 or 250 yuan, more than doubling. As for iron, the price has risen from 50 or 60 yuan per ton a year ago to 120 or 130 yuan. Therefore, the province has decided to mine iron ore and set up factories for smelting to seek self-sufficiency. Because various iron factories in the province, the Linyi Iron Manufacturing Factory, and the agricultural tool manufacturing factory all need a lot of iron. The province's iron ore is the most abundant and of the best quality in Jinling Town of the Ludai Company. It is a pity that Ludai cannot be mined due to Japanese shareholding. Other places, such as Bixian and Linyi in southern Shandong, also have iron ore that can be selected for mining. And it is very close to the Zhongxing Coal Mine, which is convenient for coal use. After mining, a factory will be set up for smelting on the spot. The Linyi iron ore was previously chemically tested by the Japanese and found to contain about 10 percent iron, and the quality is also very good. However, it is feared that the local composition cannot represent the entire mine. On the 26th, the Mining Engineering Office of the Construction Department sent the newly mined ore to the Provincial Industrial Testing Institute for detailed chemical testing to determine. In the near future, it is also planned to send personnel to inspect the iron smelting factories along the Zhengtai Railway in Shanxi to learn from them.

### Report on the Zhejiang Aquatic Products Field Survey of Sanmen Bay

Annual Fish Production Value Reaches 800,000 Yuan; Salt Pans and Shellfish Aquaculture Can Also Be Developed

Ningbo Puxin and Sanmen Bay are located in the central part of Zhejiang Province, with excellent harbors and fertile land. As early as the 24th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, Italy attempted to lease it but failed. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce was approved by the central government to open it as an autonomous commercial port, and an area from the inspection envoy's office to Cat Head Mountain was designated as the commercial port area, with a large scale. Unfortunately, the human plans were not completed, and the discussion of opening Sanmen Bay as a port was halted midway. At its peak, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Zhejiang Provincial Governor Zhu Jiahua paid close attention to this matter. The Zhejiang Provincial Government organized various survey groups to investigate the topography, soil, products, and fisheries of Sanmen Bay. The Provincial Aquatic Products Experiment Field compiled a report based on the materials from last winter's survey of the local fisheries and submitted it to the Construction Department as reference material for the development of the port. The conclusions of the report are excerpted below, which should be of interest to those concerned about this issue.

㊀ From the perspective of its location and topography, Sanmen Bay has considerable commercial value, and its fertile land and sparse population make its development necessary.

㊁ The main fish products in Sanmen Bay are large yellow croaker and reeves shad. The annual output of these two types is approximately 130,000 dan, worth 680,000 yuan. Adding other fish products, the annual fish production of Sanmen Bay is approximately 150,000 dan, worth 800,000 yuan, which is more than any other harbor in the province.

㊂ Sanmen Bay branches into various harbors. Among them, Shipu and the inspection envoy's office are the best, especially Shipu's natural topography is superior. The area of Shipu Port is larger than that of Shenjiamen Port, and it can accommodate thousands of fishing boats with ease. Therefore, without additional construction work, it is already one of the important fishing ports in the province. After the port opening at the inspection envoy's office is realized, it can also serve as a base for small double-ended boats operating in the Tianwan area during the large yellow croaker season and as a hub for the import of fish products into the interior. However, it is far from the fishing grounds during the winter season, so its position in the fishing industry may not be comparable to that of Shipu.

㊃ Sanmen Bay is located in the central part of the province's coastline. After the development of transportation in the future, land routes can connect to Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Anhui, and other provinces, and sea routes can reach various ports along the coast. This will greatly facilitate the transportation of fish. In the future, the surplus fish products from the coast of this province can be massively sold to various counties in the interior and along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway line. Therefore, the development of Sanmen Bay is beneficial to the promotion of fish products in this province and the regulation of their supply and demand.

㊄ The ramie used for manufacturing fishing nets and ropes in this province is mostly supplied by the Two Lakes region. Ningbo and Xiangshan counties also have some production. Although the output is not large, the quality is still applicable. According to the two counties, there is still a lot of wasteland, which is very suitable for growing ramie. If planting can be promoted, it will definitely be able to supply the needs of this province.

㊅ The mudflats in Sanmen Bay are very extensive. The higher ones can be developed into salt pans or used to store fresh water for planting, and the lower ones can be used for shellfish aquaculture. These are all promising undertakings in Sanmen Bay.

### Full Text of the Judgment in the Assassination of Wang Jingwei Case (Continued)

Reasoning

This case should be discussed in four parts as follows:

(A) Regarding Yu Likui's Assassination of Song

It is confirmed that on the morning of July 23, 1931, at around 7:00 AM, under the building at the East Gate of the Shanghai North Railway Station, Song Ziwen, the former Minister of Finance who was traveling from Nanjing to Shanghai, was attacked by an assassination group who threw bombs and fired guns. After he avoided the attack by ducking behind a pillar, the guards fired back, and he managed to escape. However, his secretary-general, Tang Yulu, who was traveling with him, was mistakenly shot and wounded in the left flank, right waist, and left arm, and died shortly thereafter. This has been reported in detail by various Chinese and foreign newspapers. The defendant, Yu Likui, submitted a copy of the Shanghai News from July of that year as evidence. The wounds on Secretary-General Tang Yulu were also testified by the attending physician, Wen Ganchen, in person at the Central Magistracy in Hong Kong, and the testimony was recorded by the court and forwarded by the Capital Police Department with a letter upon extradition. What should be investigated now is whether the defendant, Yu Likui, was a co-principal offender in the assassination group who carried out the killing.

The defendant, wearing a white long gown and carrying a pistol, went to the bottom of the building at the Shanghai North Railway Station with Wang Yaqiao and others. They sat next to the second and third pillars on the south side. When Song Ziwen and his entourage, Tang Yulu, passed by, they jointly raised their guns and fired, and directed the throwing of four bombs, three of which exploded. In the ensuing smoke, the defendant and his accomplices abandoned their guns and fled one after another. Song was escorted by the police on duty to the building. Not only did the police officers on duty, Zhao Xinzhong and Lu Youcai, confess to this upon arrest, but Zhang Yuhua also stated after his capture in the Constitutional Military Police Command and in the Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court that "Hua Kezhi told me about the assassination of Song Ziwen. The main members were Xie Wenda, Yu Likui, and Hua Kezhi," "The leader was Wang Yaqiao," and "I don't know how Yu Likui carried out the assassination." Furthermore, Wang Renshan stated in the Hong Kong Magistracy that in 1934 (i.e., 1931), he met Yu Likui at Wang Yaqiao's tomb. He lived on the fourth floor of 10 Yongxing Street. I visited him at that address. Wang called himself the King of Assassins, and Yu also boasted that his most successful deed was the assassination of Song Ziwen." This is sufficient to prove that the defendant was present and carried out the act, and the evidence is conclusive.

Although the statements of police officers Zhao Bichong and others differ slightly from their testimonies in the Hong Kong Central Magistracy, and the number of pillars they described at the bottom of the North Railway Station building on that day also differs from those published in the newspapers, with four pillars each on the north and south sides versus three pillars each, five years have passed since July 1931. The building was also destroyed in the January 28th Incident in 1932. Therefore, it is understandable that the witnesses may have made slight errors in their statements due to the passage of time. It is impossible to consider this a major flaw. Moreover, the witnesses observed from different locations under the building (behind the fourth pillar on the south side and behind the fourth pillar on the north side), so it is not surprising that their statements differed. The important point in this case is the appearance and behavior of the perpetrators, not the exact number of pillars or how many pillars were in the building. This is what is meant by focusing on the essential. It is true that police officers' investigation of criminals emphasizes facial features and fingerprints. Therefore, their impression of the defendant's face is deeply imprinted in their minds, and even after years, they would not have no impression at all.

The fact that the witnesses were able to accurately identify the defendant from fifteen photos in the Songhu Garrison Headquarters in December 1932 proves that they did witness the defendant at the time, which is sufficient to confirm. Furthermore, after the defendant was arrested in Hong Kong, the witnesses went to Hong Kong to confront him. Before any questioning, they were asked to separately identify the defendant from a line of ten people in Victoria Prison. They were all able to identify him accurately. Even if one of the two had a slower recognition time, it was due to the strength of their memory. It is impossible to consider it untrustworthy because one of them had a poorer memory.

The defendant claimed that the witnesses colluded with lawyers in identifying the defendant in Victoria Prison, and that among the criminals being identified, only the defendant had a beard, making it easy to identify him. However, this is the defendant's one-sided statement, and there is no concrete evidence to support it, so it should not be adopted. Moreover, according to Jimsthy Murphy, who was in charge of the identification at the time, the identification was held in Victoria Prison, in the passage between the new entrance and the old room (under the guillotine). He saw the witnesses outside the prison. Others were guarded by a police officer in the identification room. The fugitive (i.e., the defendant, hereinafter the same) and nine others were arranged in a line. This was an excellent method of identification because everyone looked very similar (seven people, including the defendant). Two had beards, and their jaws also had slight stubble. He dared to say that the others all looked very similar to the fugitive. Their clothes and hair were the same as the fugitive. Seven had hair as long as the fugitive's, and the rest had ordinary short hair. Before they were identified, Liang was asked to translate and explain the purpose of the identification to the fugitive, saying that two designated witnesses had come to identify the perpetrator of a case that occurred in Shanghai in June or July 1931 (i.e., 1931). Before calling the first witness, he asked the fugitive if he wanted to change clothes, but he did not change clothes. He stood in the line, eighth from the right. He then left the prison and brought in Lu Youcai to identify him. He did not talk to him except to call Lu's name. He had never met the witnesses before the identification was held that morning. Under the fugitive's hearing, the translator translated. He asked the witness, "Can you identify anyone in this line who is related to the incident that occurred in Shanghai in July 1931?" The witness then began to examine, walking back and forth in front of the line several times, then looking at their backs. This continued for five or six minutes. The witness stood in front of the fugitive and the fifth person, observing the fifth person for about one or two minutes, and then focused on the fugitive and designated him as the one. His identification could be called satisfactory. He also asked, "Do you recognize anyone else in this line?" The answer was, "The fifth person seems to have a very familiar face." He was then led out by another road and handed over to the police officer for guarding. Before calling the second witness (referring to Zhao Xinzhong), the fugitive was changed to the seventh position and put on the pants worn by the sixth person. He then went to bring the second witness. When he returned, he saw that the fugitive had been changed to the fifth position. After the witness understood that he was instructed to identify the criminal, he immediately walked up to the criminal and pointed him out without hesitation, and did not point out anyone else." It can be seen that the statements of the witnesses are all factual and there is no falsehood. The defendant's defense of "colluding with lawyers" and "only he had a beard among the criminals" further proves that he is making empty and deceitful statements.

Although the defendant claimed that on the evening of July 14, 1931, he had dinner at the home of Li Hua, the owner of 68 Taikang Road in Guangzhou, and that Li's cousin, Liu Zhiyuan, was present, and that he had gone to Hong Kong to prove this, proving that the defendant was in Guangzhou on that day and could not have committed the assassination in Shanghai, Liu Zhiyuan went to Hong Kong to testify at the request of Tan Zelin, and it was not the witness's original intention. Moreover, his statement of time is extremely vague, only saying that "I did not pay special attention to the strangers I met during the lychee season, and can only vaguely remember the date. I met the fugitive during the lychee season." The lychee season is very long, and they are sold from the first to the sixth month of the lunar calendar. It is difficult to guess which month and day the lychee party that the witness mentioned was. Even if he later said that "I saw the suspect living alone in Li Hua's house during the Great Heat Festival, and there were no other women," the witness did not specify the year when he made the statement. Whether the Great Heat Festival was in 1931 is questionable. Even if he finally added a definite word on the year, it was 1921, but it is impossible to confirm whether this kind of after-the-fact addition is faithful and it is difficult to adopt it. As for the statement that "During the January 28th Incident in 1932, the defendant organized a national salvation death squad in Shanghai and participated in the war with the 19th Route Army. His photos were published in various newspapers, and the Shanghai Confucian Temple also displayed them. Zhao Xinzhong and others were road police on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and belonged to civil servants. During the war in Shanghai, they would have read the newspapers. If the police recognized the defendant in Shanghai during the war within a few months of Minister Song's assassination, they would have been able to recognize him clearly, and the reward for the assassination of Minister Song was tens of thousands of yuan. Why didn't they report it to the bureau and arrest him immediately after reading the newspaper and claim this huge reward?" It is not known that the road police served in the respective stations and sections of the railway and could not easily leave. The witnesses may not have been able to see the defendant's photos displayed in the Shanghai Confucian Temple. Moreover, according to Zhao Xinzhong and others, they participated in the Shanghai war work due to the destruction of the station and did not have time to read the newspapers. Therefore, it is not without this fact that they could not see the defendant's photos. It is even more difficult to use this to try to overturn the testimony.

Other than that, the defendant argued that "the witness stated in the Hong Kong court that a man in his forties with a beard fired the first shot, but according to the Shanghai newspaper, Song's guard said that four young people fired the shots. It can be seen that the witness's statement that I fired the shots was not true at the time." The court investigated the Shanghai News submitted by the defendant regarding the situation described by the guard, which stated that "There were many people at the East Gate at the time, and it seemed that only four young people fired the shots." However, according to Song's own statement to the newspaper reporters, "According to my guards, at least four criminals fired the shots, or perhaps more than that." This proves that the so-called four young people in the witness's statements were not definitive. Judging from the words "it seemed that only" in the above text and Song's statements "at least" and "perhaps more," it is not difficult to imagine. Moreover, the files of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters also stated that the number of criminals captured in the two times was more than four, and there were also people of middle age or older among them, such as Zhang Yucheng, Liu Wencheng, and Liu Gang. The defendant attempted to overturn the powerful testimony of Zhao Xinzhong and others with the uncertain words in the newspaper, which is even more difficult to believe. If it is said that the witness's behavior does not seem like that of a road police officer, it is feared that they were not present at the time. However, the report on July 25 of that year stated that the two road police section chiefs did have the name of Police Chief Zhao Xinzhong (the newspaper mistakenly reported it as Zhao Zhongxin, see the newspaper submitted by the defendant). It can be known that the witnesses were all road police and were undoubtedly present to protect Song. Therefore, the defendant's various defenses are obviously not facts.

Furthermore, the defendant claimed that the assassins of Song, Long Lin, Zhang Yucheng, Li Songde, Sun Qichun, etc., stated at the time that there were about ten accomplices and did not mention his name, which can prove that there was no fact of joint killing. After the court verified the original files of the Long Lin and other murder cases in the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the number of people who confessed to assassinating Song was inconsistent. Some said that there were ten people, including Wang Yaqiao, Gong Chunfu, Gong Xianglin, Li Songde, Liu Gang, Tang Ming, Long Lin, Gao Hansheng, Qiu Jiliang, and Zhang Yucheng (see Zhang Yucheng, Li Songde, etc. confessing in the Public Concession Patrol Room on June 26, 1933). Some said that there were ten people, including Sun Fenghai, Xu Zhongde, Xi Wenfu, Sun Wende, Liang Guixin, Zhou Maoen, Yin Qinglin, Li Baoyuan, Chen Fengchu, and Sun Qijun (see Sun Qijun confessing in the Investigation Team of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters on November 14, 1936, and Zhou Maoen confessing in the Songhu Garrison Headquarters on December 8, 1936). Some said that there were eight people, including Xu Zhongde, Liang Guixin, Sun Wende, Chen Fengchu, Zhou Maoen, Sun Fenghai, Sun Yiyuan, and Li Baoyuan (see Li Baoyuan confessing in the Songhu Garrison Headquarters on November 4 and 13, 1936). Some said that there were nine people inside, including Li Baoyuan, Sun Qijun, Zhou Maoen, Sun Fenghai, Liang Guixin, Sun Wende, Sun Yiyuan, Xu Zhongde, and Yin Qinglin, and four people outside, including Hua Kezhi, Wang Yaqiao, Chen Cheng, and Zhang Siming (see Yin Qinglin confessing in the Investigation Team of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters on November 14, 1936). Some said that Sun Fenghai, Chen Fengchu, Sun Wende, and Sun Wenfu each took a pistol into the station, and Wang Yaqiao, Zhang Siming, Hua Kezhi, Chen Cheng, and Yin Qinglin were outside the station (see Yin Qinglin confessing in the Songchu Garrison Headquarters on December 8 of the same year). Some said that Gong Xianglin said that they did the assassination of Song at the North Station (see Long Lin confessing in the Songhu Garrison Headquarters on October 18, 1934). The number of people varied, and the names were also very different. However, the reason why there were many or few differences was nothing more than because the organization of the group was too large. The number and names of the people who carried out the crime at the time may not have been known in detail by everyone. Even if they knew in detail, they may not have stated them truthfully, and they may not have been able to guarantee that there were no omissions. This kind of passive confession of others in another case is difficult to prove that the defendant is beneficial.

The testimony of the above-mentioned witnesses, Zhao Xinzhong and others, is not false, and the counter-evidence presented by the defendant cannot be established. His involvement in the implementation is even more obvious. The court will not allow him to deceive and deny it. However, the defendant and Wang Yaqiao and others jointly murdered Song Ziwen, but mistakenly killed Tang Yulu. He should be held responsible for attempted murder and negligent death. However, his crime date was before March 5, 1932. Except that the assassination of Song was premeditated and cannot be reduced or exempted from punishment due to amnesty, the most serious penalty for his negligent death is imprisonment for no more than two years, which should be pardoned according to law.

### Suzhou: Five Kidnappers Executed by Firing Squad in Wujiang

In September 1935, a newly married couple from the Shi family, a wealthy household in Hengjing Town, Wuxian County, were kidnapped by lake bandits and redeemed for 10,000 yuan. Last summer, the Xia family, a wealthy farmer in Zhouzhuang Township, including Xia Qijiang, Xia Ling, and Xia Liugen, were kidnapped and redeemed one after another for several thousand yuan. Last winter, the case was investigated by the Taihu Joint Defense Office of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Water Police. The ringleaders were identified as Bao Zhengquan and Wu Jiaji, two detectives from the 1st District Investigation Team of the Jiangsu Water Police. However, the two bandits, Bao and Wu, had already fled. Only six accomplices, Xu Yongfu, Chen Chonggao, Chen Zhenglian, Jiang Guilin, Zuo Kekuan, and Li Defu, were captured. After interrogation and judgment, except for Li Defu, who was sentenced to imprisonment, the remaining five bandits were all sentenced to death. With the approval of the Military Commission, they were escorted to the execution ground outside the East Gate of Wujiang and executed by firing squad yesterday (27th) morning.

Second District Commissioner's Office to Move to Suzhou

Shi Kuiling, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the 2nd District of Jiangsu Province, concentrated on training and inspecting the paochia chiefs of the eight counties under his jurisdiction. On the afternoon of the 26th, he came to Suzhou from Wuxi to inspect the various agencies. On the morning of the 27th, he inspected the opium addict factory in the 1st District and reviewed the police force. Then, he inspected the houses and training grounds for the paochia chiefs. Because there are more than ten thousand paochia chiefs in the eight counties, it is planned to train them in Suzhou in eight batches starting in early June. Commissioner Shi also believed that various trainings in the eight counties were mostly gathered in Suzhou. In order to facilitate command and management, he prepared to move the Second District Commissioner's Office to Suzhou. Shi left Suzhou at 5:00 PM on the 27th and returned to Wuxi.

### Wuxi: Strict Urging for Collection of Old Taxes

The county's old land tax arrears, from 1927 to 1931, amounted to 1 million yuan. Magistrate Long was responsible for clearing it up, urging and pursuing it tightly. It was implemented on December 1 last year. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance also sent a commissioner to Wuxi to assist in the handling, first chasing 60%, proceeding in three phases, with one-tenth collected in each phase. However, the headmen of each district and the grain households were stubborn and refused to pay repeatedly. Therefore, it was decided to detain them. At that time, more than 140 grain households and headmen were detained. As of yesterday (27th), those who had found a suitable guarantor were released in succession, and those without guarantors were still detained, totaling about 20 people. A total of more than 100,000 yuan of old taxes have been recovered. Now, the deadline is only three days. Because the number of pursuits is not strong, the province has ordered an extension of one month, from May 1 to the end of June. Fang Guoding, the director of the land tax, will use severe measures to urge the pursuit within this extension period. For those who owe the most old taxes, their property will be sealed up and compensated. After the above-mentioned old arrears are cleared up, the old taxes from 1935 to 1936 will be continued to be pursued. However, the amount owed is not as large as that from 1927 to 1934.

### Zhenjiang: Construction of Provincial Capital Wharf Begins Immediately

The location of the wharf is at the mouth of the Yangtze River on Zhongzheng Road. The construction contract has been signed and it has been decided to start work within days. The contractor has prepared everything.

### Hangzhou: Planning to Establish Large Cotton Yarn Factory

The promotion of American cotton in Zhejiang Province has achieved good results, and the annual production has increased. In 1937, the promotion will continue in Xiaoshan, Yuyao, Dinghai, Haiyan, Yin County, Shangyu and other counties, totaling 100,000 mu. It is learned that the provincial authorities plan to make yarn and cloth from American cotton in these counties to achieve self-sufficiency. At present, they are planning to establish a large-scale yarn factory. The original plan was for 100,000 spindles, but the amount of money required was too large, and it would be difficult to do it all at once. Therefore, it was decided to reduce it to 50,000 spindles, with a capital of about 5-6 million yuan. A preliminary plan has been drawn up to purchase land for 300,000 yuan, and the rest will be used to purchase machinery, create wealth, and build factory buildings. The factory site will be in Hangzhou County, Xiaoshan County, and Yuyao County. Personnel will be sent to investigate and select a site. The capital has been discussed with the banking sector and is currently in progress.

### Nantong: Early Ban on Opium Addiction

The Fourth District includes Tongzhou, Rugao, Hai'an, Chongming, Qidong, and Jingjiang counties. After a meeting of the county magistrates convened by the Commissioner's Office, it was decided to implement the zoned ban on opium smoking. Each county was required to ban opium smoking by the end of 1937. After approval by the Department of Civil Affairs, a prohibition inspector was sent to the Commissioner's Office to supervise the counties' handling.

City and Suburban Vegetable Vendors Strike

The city and suburban vegetable vendors of Tongzhou opposed the relocation to the vegetable market in the south of the city for sale. They all went on strike on the 26th. The police bureau sent police to the countryside to persuade them, and they still went to the vegetable market to trade in various ways. The strike is expected to subside within days.

### Danyang: Robbery and Murder by Bandits in Xidi Township

Liu Shurong, a villager in Zhongfencai Township, Xidi Township, 1st District, made a living by farming and had a well-to-do family, which led to him being targeted by petty thieves. On the night before (22nd) at about 8:00 PM, six bandits suddenly came, wielding box guns and rushing into the house. They forbade screaming and plundered wildly. Before leaving, they kidnapped Shurong's 13-year-old son. At that time, Liu Jiulong's son, Shucai, who lived nearby, heard a lot of noise outside and opened the door to check. The criminals saw someone opening the door in the dark and suspected that they were arresting them, so they opened fire, hitting Shucai three times, and he fell to the ground and died.

### Zhou Qigang Discusses Overseas Chinese Affairs and Suggests Convening an Overseas Chinese Economic Conference

Zhou Qigang, Vice Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, met with overseas Chinese compatriots returning to the country in Shanghai. He arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday (the 26th) with Xie Zhongfu of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and stayed at the New Asia Hotel. A Central News Agency reporter visited him yesterday to inquire about overseas Chinese affairs. He spoke as follows:

Hoping that Overseas Chinese Compatriots will Return to the Country for Sightseeing

There are more than ten million overseas Chinese compatriots scattered around the world, who are extremely concerned about the affairs of their motherland, both large and small. However, because they have lived overseas for a long time, they are not very clear about the situation, and they are often subjected to provocation and alienation by foreigners, which inevitably leads to estrangement. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission pays close attention to this. Fortunately, in recent years, overseas Chinese compatriots have successively formed teams to return to the country for sightseeing, and have gone to various cities and border areas in China to conduct on-the-spot inspections, which has led to a considerable understanding. The provocation and alienation by foreigners overseas will naturally be self-defeating. Therefore, in the future, it is hoped that overseas Chinese compatriots can return to the country for sightseeing once every one or two years, so as to understand the true situation in the country.

Overseas Chinese Associations Strive for Administrative Convenience

Zhou hopes that people across the country will recognize that in the current world trend, overseas Chinese affairs administration is a factor in the rise and fall of the nation, and that in the future, China's attitude towards overseas Chinese affairs will not only be to deal with the personal affairs of overseas Chinese compatriots. The authorities of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission are now doing their best to facilitate the smooth administration of overseas Chinese affairs. He also said that many overseas Chinese compatriots have returned to invest in industries in recent years, which is a good phenomenon. The central government has long promulgated measures to encourage overseas Chinese compatriots to return to invest, and in the future, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission should do its best to provide overseas Chinese compatriots who return to invest with strong assistance.

Suggest Convening an Economic Conference

The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission is currently holding overseas Chinese education lectures, convening teachers from overseas Chinese schools to return to the country to attend lectures and accompany them to various places for inspection, so that they can achieve considerable results in the education of overseas Chinese compatriots after they return to overseas in the future. In order to understand the current economic situation of overseas Chinese compatriots, I will suggest that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission hold an overseas Chinese economic conference, inviting overseas Chinese compatriots to participate and discuss matters concerning the economic affairs of overseas Chinese compatriots in the future. The overseas Chinese economy has a great impact on the entire national economy, and it is necessary to discuss and help it in detail. Zhou returned to Beijing by train at 4:00 p.m. yesterday because of matters to be dealt with in Beijing.

### Severe Disaster Situation in Shaanxi, Henan, and Gansu

Grain Transportation Bureau Ordered by the Ministry of Finance to Send Special Commissioners to Conduct Price Stabilization

The Ministry of Finance recently stated that the disaster situation in Shaanxi, Henan, and Gansu provinces is extremely serious. It has successively allocated public bonds and disaster relief funds. It has now decided to carry out price stabilization in the relevant provinces and regions to provide universal relief. It has ordered the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau to send personnel to Shaanxi, Henan, and Gansu provinces to properly handle the matter in conjunction with local governments and impartial gentry. It is reported that after receiving the order, Zheng Baozhao, the director of the bureau, has appointed Li Zhenhua to Shaanxi, Gu Xinsan to Henan, and Li Longwen to Gansu to handle the price stabilization matters together, and to investigate the local food situation and transportation methods to serve as a reference for controlling the people's food supply.

### Half of the Industrial and Commercial Loans Have Been Recovered

Outstanding Loans Will Be Collected Separately

The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee, in order to regulate the financial situation of local industries and commerce, was jointly organized by the banking industry under the direction of the Ministry of Finance to handle credit loans. It has issued more than 970,000 yuan in total. Later, due to the implementation of the legal tender policy, the financial situation in the market became active. It was ordered by the ministry to stop lending and complete the work within a time limit. It is now learned that after receiving the order, the committee stopped lending and began to handle the closing matters. As of recently, about half of the loans have been recovered, and they are currently urging the guarantors and borrowers to repay the loans. However, some borrowers have misunderstood the purpose of the public lending and have deliberately delayed repayment, citing the fact that the committee has been ordered to close down. Although the committee has repeatedly urged them, it has been ineffective. Therefore, the committee has to resort to legal means to urge the debtors to repay the loans as soon as possible due to legal relations.

### The Shantytown Representative Meeting in the Pudong District of Shanghai Resolved Yesterday Morning

Four Measures Presented to the Municipal Council; Mr. He Promised to Consider Them

New Voice News Agency reports that the residents of various shantytowns in the Pudong District of Shanghai held an emergency protest meeting of shantytown representatives from the entire district at 53 Chaoyang Road yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m. because the Municipal Council insisted on its decision to demolish the shantytowns. Under the chairmanship of Tang Anping, four measures were decided upon, and Tang Anping, Xu Xiguang, Sun Xudan, Shen Changgui, Zhang Buyun, and others were selected to petition the Municipal Council at 1:00 p.m. yesterday to present their opinions. The main points of the petition are summarized as follows: ㊀ Shantytown residents should be treated the same as other citizens. The donation paid by shantytown residents should be based on the standard of flat houses or pay taxes based on land prices. ㊁ According to the ten-year plan of the Municipal Council, a monthly donation of five cents should be collected. Three people should be selected from the shantytown residents, one person from the Municipal Council, and one person from the legal community to form a shantytown tax payment association. Each household should pay six yuan per year (a total of 4,000 households, 24,000 yuan). The funds should be deposited in the bank, and 140,000 yuan can be collected in ten years, which can be used to build flat houses and charge fees according to the municipal government's public housing village). ㊂ According to the income from the third item, land should be purchased, shantytowns should be demolished, and flat houses should be built. The land price should be 15 yuan per square foot, totaling 800 square feet, totaling 19,000 yuan in foreign currency. After ten years, all shantytowns can be demolished. ㊃ According to the current situation, shantytown addresses should be numbered for management. Mr. He received them and gave special consideration to the four opinions presented by the representatives. The shantytown residents are now waiting for the approval of the Municipal Council. If it is not adopted, they will hold a large-scale petition again within a few days.

### Fellow-Provincial Organizations Jointly Petition the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Abolish Consular Jurisdiction

Infringement of Sovereignty is Opposed by All Chinese People; The Japanese Side's Sabotage of Negotiations is Regrettable

More than 50 fellow-provincial organizations in Shanghai, including the Guangdong, Ningbo, Hebei, Shaoxing, Zhenjiang, Zhuji, Shexian, Jiangyin, Shangyu, Danyang, Chaozhou, Zhenhai, Yuyao, Rugao, and other organizations, yesterday petitioned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying that the petition requested the voluntary abolition of consular jurisdiction in order to unify legal rights and maintain national independence and dignity. Since the Qing Dynasty signed unequal treaties with the great powers, the entire Chinese nation has suffered greatly and has been unable to develop. They have been groaning and struggling to this day. At that time, various countries, citing the poor judicial system, set up the so-called consular jurisdiction, and unscrupulous residents living in our country were able to take advantage of it, and the unification of legal rights was brutally destroyed. In summary, the harm is about two points. We will explain it to you, sir. All politically complete countries are absolutely not subject to any external interference within their territory. This is a common principle in international law, and the existence of consular jurisdiction is enough to destroy the judicial dignity of an independent country. This is one reason why it should be abolished. All people living in our country's territory obtain the right to be protected by the laws of the place of residence. This is an immutable principle. However, if there is any illegal or undisciplined behavior, they should also be subject to the judicial sanctions of the place of residence. Today, the facts are the opposite. Whether it is selling drugs, evading customs duties, or smuggling military fire, they all do it openly and without any scruples. Therefore, the national economy and social stability are both destroyed. This is the second reason why it should be abolished. We hope that you, sir, will uphold the last words of the Premier, follow the resolutions of the All-China Congress, and resolutely declare the voluntary abolition, as a preliminary step to lifting unequal treaties, unifying legal rights, and consolidating our national foundation. We rely on this. Sincerely presented to Wang, the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

### The Sichuan Provincial Disaster Relief Association Cables the Central Government,恳求(kenqiu) to Continue to Allocate Public Bonds for Disaster Relief

Please Actively Carry out the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association and Realize it as soon as Possible

Xin Xin News Agency reports that the Sichuan Provincial Relief Association received a telegram from the Sichuan Provincial Disaster Relief Association yesterday, hoping to quickly ask the Central Government to issue an additional 15 million public bonds and transfer them to Sichuan for disaster relief in order to save the disaster-stricken people. The original telegram said: Sichuan Disaster Relief Association, the emergency reports from the counties have been received one after another. The counties have not received any rain recently, and the drought is becoming more and more serious. Rice prices are soaring, and the poor are unable to buy it. Due to the sluggish salt prices and reduced work, the number of starving people is increasing, which is extremely pitiful. Now, the starving people are forced by life to do something that has never happened before, forming groups to rob food from large households and shops to fill their hunger, or becoming bandits, robbing grain merchants, and the local order is greatly disrupted. The dangerous situation in the future is even more worrying. It is imperative to handle emergency relief. In addition to the provincial government considering the situation and reducing grain taxes separately, the urgent relief will be carried out in the severely affected areas first with half of this year's disaster relief reserve funds and the public bonds allocated by the Ministry of Finance, together with the provincial funds. However, the disaster area is too wide, and this relief fund is really a drop in the bucket and will not solve the problem. It is heard that your association has recommended representatives to ask the Central Government to issue 15 million yuan in disaster relief public bonds, which is a fundamental relief strategy. The news has spread and is comforting. We hope that you will actively carry out this plan so that it can be realized as soon as possible, so that the disaster victims in Sichuan can be revived. The urgency of the telegram is beyond description. The Sichuan Provincial Disaster Relief Committee kowtows, 感(gan).

### Lawyers' Income Tax Approved to be Paid in One Lump Sum

The lawyers' associations in various places suggested to the Lawyers' Association of the Republic of China, and the association recommended lawyers from Shanghai, Hangxian, Wuxian, Jiangdu, and Zhenjiang to hold a meeting in Shanghai. It is said that the Shanghai Lawyers' Association has recommended representatives to go to Beijing to petition. The Ministry of Finance approved the adoption of lawyers' income tax to be paid in one lump sum at the end of each year. The Shanghai Lawyers' Association sent a letter to the lawyers' associations in various places to inform them of the Ministry of Finance's adoption of the income tax payment situation for reference.

### The New Life Movement General Association Held a New Life Movement Propaganda Week

The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association received a notice from the General Association yesterday, saying that in order to improve the New Life Movement radio propaganda and enhance the interest of the audience, the association has agreed with the Central Broadcasting Station that from the 26th of this month to the 2nd of May, it will be the New Life Movement Propaganda Week.

### The Guangdong Police Administration Inspection Group Visited the Municipal Government Yesterday

The domestic police administration inspection group organized by the Guangdong Provincial Police Bureau, including Huang Kairong, Zeng Guanglun, Shen Shujian, and Huang Ganying, arrived in Shanghai on the President Fillet ship the day before yesterday and stayed at the New Asia Hotel. At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, they went to the city center area for sightseeing and visited the various agencies under the municipal government in the afternoon. They went to the Municipal Police Bureau on Penglai Road to inspect. They are scheduled to rest in Shanghai briefly today and then go to Hangzhou and then to Tianjin and Hankou for inspection.

### The Citizens' Association Petitions the Municipal Government to Continue Negotiations on Cross-Border Road Construction

The infringement of sovereignty is opposed by all Chinese people; the Japanese side's sabotage of negotiations is regrettable

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, districts 7, 12, 16, 27, 38, and other district associations, jointly petitioned Acting Mayor Yu of the Municipal Government yesterday morning, saying that the petition was for the Japanese consul to unreasonably obstruct the negotiations on cross-border road construction. They earnestly request that the established policy be continued to negotiate in order to restore sovereignty and comfort the people's hopes. The construction of roads outside the boundary by the Municipal Council of the Public Concession has no legal basis and infringes on sovereignty, which is opposed by all Chinese people. In 1932 and 1934, the government and the Municipal Council negotiated and compromised twice, but they were repeatedly interfered with by the Japanese side and delayed indefinitely. Since the Yugu Village incident last month, it has become more and more obvious that it is necessary to recover the cross-border road construction as soon as possible. Therefore, the head of the government and the president of the Municipal Council, Fessenden, repeatedly consulted and fortunately reached an agreement, which can be initially resolved. However, the Japanese consul came out to obstruct it and demanded that the area around North Sichuan Road be劃出(huachu), destroying the negotiations, which is regrettable. I hope that the recovery of cross-border road construction is a matter of sovereignty and is what the Chinese people desire. I earnestly request that the established policy be continued to negotiate so that sovereignty can be restored as soon as possible. It is fortunate. Sincerely presented.

### Xie Fengyi Ji Yarn Factory Liquidation Reaches a Settlement

New Voice News Agency reports that the Xie Fengyi Ji Textile Company, which has been shut down, previously petitioned the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to act as an agent for settlement and Li Wenjie Accountant as the liquidator. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of all creditors at 2:00 p.m. yesterday on the third floor of the chamber. A total of 18 creditors attended, with a debt amount of 153,893.14 yuan. Ke Ganchen and Yan E'sheng were sent by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce as agents, and the liquidator, Li Wenjie Accountant, met the legal quorum. The meeting was declared open. Chairman Ke Ganchen first reported the process of the association accepting and handling the settlement, and Li Accountant reported the process of auditing the entire accounts. Then the settlement plan was announced, saying that the company is a limited liability company with a total share capital of 200,000 yuan, which was fully paid up at one time. Since 1934, due to the impact of the market downturn, the cotton was expensive and the yarn was cheap, and the losses have been increasing. It was forced to suspend work in June 1935 after a resolution by the board of directors to wait for an opportunity, and it was submitted to the shareholders' meeting for approval. However, due to the excessive debt and the heavy interest burden, and the fact that the yarn price continued to fall after the shutdown, the loss from selling inventory was even greater. In 1936, the interest on the factory mortgage loan and the unified tax on the factory's inventory, as well as the salaries of the five employees who remained in the factory, were unable to be paid. In the autumn of the same year, the yarn market turned around and it was originally intended to resume work, but the debt was too high and working capital could not be raised. The mortgagee of the factory base demanded that the entire mortgage loan be repaid because the company did not pay interest, otherwise they would execute the auction according to the contract. At that time, the board of directors believed that if the mortgage creditor was allowed to auction, they were afraid that they would suffer too much loss, which would affect the interests of ordinary unsecured creditors even more. Therefore, they decided to find someone to buy it themselves, hoping to get a better selling price. Therefore, in the winter of last year, they made many contacts and sold it to Mr. Li Zhenzhi of Datong Yarn Factory for a price of 105,000 yuan. The remaining materials were sold for 5,000 yuan (which was originally mortgaged to the Dalai Bank), and the deposit rent paid for the leased land and the water and electricity deposit cabinets were recovered. After deducting the land rent due this year, another 5,906.66 yuan was received, totaling 115,506.66 yuan. After deducting the principal and interest of the factory base mortgage loan of 83,342.45 yuan, the priority debt of the Dalai Bank's material mortgage loan of 4,701.64 yuan, the factory sale commission of 2,000 yuan, the compensation for laid-off employees and the subsidies for workers to move out of the workshops, and various expenses of 3,306.66 yuan, a debt of 22,555.91 yuan is still owed, of which about 1,000 yuan must be set aside for this settlement fee and the subsidies for employees who have not been dismissed. The unsecured debt owed by the company totals 156,281.31 yuan. It is estimated that only 13 yuan can be allocated for every 100 yuan. It is proposed that this be used as full repayment. The company has unlimited regret for the unsecured creditors in this plan, but can only ask the creditors to forgive and accept the allocation plan in order to end the matter. As for the odd numbers, they will be notified separately after the settlement is clear. It is proposed that the whole number of 13 yuan repaid for every 100 yuan will be repaid first within ten days after the plan is approved. Is this appropriate? We await your decision. As a result of the vote, 17 votes were obtained. The whole body passed and Huizhong and Dalai Banks were immediately appointed as representatives of all creditors. Then the meeting was adjourned.

### Large Quantities of Foreign Wheat Imported This Month

This Year's Domestic Wheat Crop Expected to be Poor Again

Excessive rainfall and fluctuating temperatures in recent days have had a significant impact on spring planting, especially for wheat. Wheat is usually harvested at the end of May, and at this time it is growing and solidifying. However, due to abnormal weather, the color will be reduced a lot, so it is expected that this year's wheat crop will be poor again. As a result, foreign wheat is taking advantage of the situation. It is learned that the amount of foreign wheat imported this month, used only by flour mills in this city, has reached more than 40,000 tons.

### Most Creditors of the Tongyi Company Agree to Resume Business

According to Datong News Agency, since the Tongyi Trust Company declared its suspension of business, Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Pan Zhaobang, and Chen Jugao have taken up the role of coordination for a long time. It is now learned that the creditors of the company in various places are satisfied with the coordination plan proposed by Du and others, and the number of those who agree to resume business has accounted for an absolute majority. Once the bankruptcy administrator convenes a creditors' meeting, the resumption of business can be formally approved. Regarding the resumption of business funds for the company, the former coordinators have sought huge sums of money from major banks in the city at the request of the creditors in order to replenish the company's business. It has now been agreed that the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, and the China Exchange Bank will jointly contribute 6.4 million yuan, but the banks all regard the company's resumption of business as the sole condition and have already signed a contract.

### Jianghai Customs Anti-Smuggling Personnel Issue Letter to Compatriots

According to the Central News Agency, it is not uncommon for Japanese ronin to engage in smuggling and assault in Shanghai, and to beat customs officers. The Chinese staff of Jianghai Customs are extremely angry about this, so they specially convened a general meeting of all Chinese staff representatives in a certain place last night to discuss ways to intensify anti-smuggling efforts, and issued a letter to compatriots from the Jianghai Customs anti-smuggling personnel, as follows:

Compatriots across the country, the bloody facts of the last time are still vividly remembered in our minds, and now, with the wounds and humiliation we have endured, they are once again inflicted upon us. Today, the dual奏 of the enemy's military and economic offensive will be even more pressing. This is what we can expect. Therefore, the road before us is very clear. There is only one road, that is a difficult, rugged road that requires us to struggle and sacrifice. Facing this thorny road, facing the enemy's iron rulers, wooden sticks, and short clubs, do we tremble? We will not tremble, we will not retreat. In this incident, our experiences, our pain, our bloodshed, are enough to give our compatriots a guarantee that we will continue to work hard in our duties. Compatriots, we are customs officers, we are soldiers on the front line of economic national defense. We usually receive generous treatment from the country. In this extraordinary period, we should work hard to intensify anti-smuggling efforts and fulfill our responsibilities to repay the country and the people for their ardent expectations of us. We are very clear about the seriousness of the responsibility that the current national crisis has placed on us, and we will complete this important mission with great enthusiasm and perseverance. Therefore, in the last declaration, we shouted out the call to "arm ourselves." We are very pleased that the last call received enthusiastic sympathy and assistance from all sectors of the country. This enthusiastic sympathy and assistance has comforted our souls and reduced our pain, and has further increased our courage and determination to carry out our duties. When we are carrying out the anti-smuggling mission, we always feel that behind us there are the eyes of compatriots across the country who are eagerly expecting us and the hearts of those who are caring for us. Therefore, we are even more cautious and dare not fail the expectations of our compatriots. But compatriots, your enthusiasm and assistance, in addition to warming our hearts, we cannot use our hands to confront the shameless and evil ronin's iron rulers and bayonets. In addition to your enthusiasm and assistance, we need more weapons. How urgently we need weapons! It is unsettling. Compatriots, not only can we not get the weapons we urgently need, but even the rewards and guarantees that we should have when we carry out anti-smuggling efforts are not available. For example, in the last incident, the Chinese staff of the customs wanted to make some expressions, but a part of the senior foreign staff of the customs came out to stop it, which is a clear proof. We are heartbroken about this incident, but life is forcing us to endure unreasonable obstacles. We earnestly hope that compatriots across the country will give us practical assistance in this regard and give us rewards and guarantees for anti-smuggling efforts so that we can more bravely engage in close combat with the despicable and shameless smuggling ronin. Dear compatriots, for the sake of national tax revenue and to stop this smuggling that is enough to put us to death, we believe that you will not let us down.

The internal office hours of Qianye have been extended by one or two hours each according to the affairs of each firm. The foreign dismantling of Qianye market has risen accordingly, and yesterday it was 15 cents per thousand yuan.

### Shengdeshan Society Collects Relief Funds for Dengfeng County, Henan

Shengdeshan Society of Jixuehui at the intersection of Yongan Street, Minquan Road, yesterday received a courier telegram from the government of Dengfeng County, Henan Province, along with food (buckwheat flowers) for the disaster victims, which shows that the disaster situation in the county is serious, and the people are waiting to be fed. The original telegram reads: "I have found that in Dengyi, the Song Mountains stretch, gravel is all over the fields, there are very few wells and springs, and the soil is thin. Even in the year of abundance, the people are still worried about freezing and starvation. What's more, there has been no rain for years, and the autumn crops have yielded nothing. The disaster-stricken area is no less than 7,000 square miles, and the disaster-stricken population has exceeded 200,000. At first, they sold livestock, then sold their children, and finally their houses were empty, and they were waiting to be fed. After detailed re-examination by the provincial committee, it has been listed as the most severely drought-stricken county of the first class, and the central government has allocated 12,000 yuan for emergency relief, which has been scattered and placed on file. However, the disaster area is too wide and the disaster victims are too numerous, and the water in the cup is a drop in the bucket. Even if it is universally relieved, since last winter, there has been no rain, and the second wheat has not been sown, and the spring famine has become a reality. Some disaster victims dig up soil and stone powder to eat, and some look for waste and pond residue to eat. Those who died on the way due to poisoning and abdominal distension are not uncommon. The county magistrate and others often go out to comfort them in person. The disaster victims with gaunt faces and dove-like shapes, supporting the old and carrying the young, cry and kowtow in a circle. It is unbearable to hear and see that the number of deaths is increasing day by day, and the future is unthinkable. I have always admired your society for its charitable heart, so I specially inspect the ordinary food for the disaster victims and appeal in a telegram. I sincerely ask you to consider the serious disaster situation and make donations to help us handle emergency relief and maintain people's lives. I am grateful and look forward to it. Respectfully, County Magistrate Ru Cai, etc. of Dengfeng County, Henan, etc." After receiving the telegram, the society, in addition to trying to raise funds, if benevolent people are willing to donate money, the society can remit it on their behalf.

### China Southern Trading Company Undertakes Silk Cocoon Mortgage

China Southern Trading Company, located at 266 Beijing Road, was established in the 13th year of the Republic of China and engages in import and export business, especially dedicated to promoting national products in various parts of Nanyang. The business has always been prosperous. This year, the company, in view of the domestic silk industry, is quite depressed, and has set up a silk cocoon department, specializing in buying and selling raw silk. If there are silk reeling factories or raw silk cooperatives in the mainland who want to sell their products, they can entrust the company to sell them and undertake mortgages. The procedures are simple and the interest is low. If silk factories and hosiery factories in this port need to select raw silk materials, the company hires experienced silk weaving experts who can recognize designs and select raw materials that are both excellent and cheaper. It is indeed an organization that connects the raw silk industry.

### The Cause of Death of Wu Benqing in the Chongde Lane Murder Case in Zhabei is Unclear

A Cut on the Neck of the Deceased Was More Than an Inch Deep; Blood Was Dripping From the Utility Knife

No. 70 Chongde Lane, Zhaohengfeng Road, Zhabei, is a single-story Shikumen building. The second landlord is Chen Songtao, also known as Chen Songqiao, who is 62 years old and from Yangzhou. He used to work on ships in Hankou. Chen has a wife and a younger brother. His wife, Wang, is 54 years old this year. His younger brother, named Songhai, all

live in the same house.

Chen Songtao lives in the back of the living room downstairs. A glass canopy is built in the front patio of the living room and rented to Wu Benqing, a fellow villager, (also known as Wu Chunyuan, who is 26 years old this year,) who makes writing brushes for a living. Above the second landlord's bedroom in the back of the living room, there is a two-story loft, which is sublet to Wang Ligao. Wang is 34 years old, also from Yangzhou, and works as a pedicureist in a certain bathhouse.

Yesterday Noon

At twelve o'clock, the mistress of the second landlord, Wang, was cleaning up meals in the kitchen. Wu Benqing, because he usually recognized Wang as his adoptive mother, went to Wang's bedroom to defecate. Then Wang also needed to urinate, so she rushed out of the kitchen, and suddenly saw blood flowing from the

room doorway

and the door was closed. She pushed the door open and saw a corpse lying in a pool of blood. Upon closer inspection, it was Wu Benqing. She immediately ran to report to the patrol police of Hengfeng Road Police Station, who reported it to the police station. At the same time, she temporarily dragged the corpse out of the room and placed it in front of the living room. After the police station sent personnel to inspect, they often took the mistress of the second landlord, Wang, and Wang's uncle, Chen Songhai, to the station for questioning. At this time, Wang Ligao, who lived in the two-story loft, suddenly carried bedding, etc.

took the opportunity to escape

A neighbor, Mr. Jia, tracked him to the Hengfeng Road Bridge and called the police to arrest him and take him to the station. At about 5 pm, the local bailiff Shen Xiaowu reported to the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate by telephone and sent Prosecutor Deng Peiyi to inspect the scene. There was a knife wound on the throat, more than an inch deep and about three inches long. Chen Songqiao, the second landlord, was also summoned for questioning. The corpse was handed over to the deceased's elder siblings for coffin collection.

A bloody knife was found

under the box. It was the utility knife that the deceased used to cut pens. It was shaped like a kitchen knife but sharper. Blood was dripping from the knife. Now, the Hengfeng Road Police Station is preparing to send it to the Local Court for investigation. According to the second landlord, the deceased suddenly packed the handicrafts he made after dinner and hid them in the room. This unfortunate incident happened. According to the deceased's elder siblings, the deceased usually had mental illness. Therefore, it is still difficult to speculate whether it was suicide or murder.

### Employment Agencies Unable to Increase Donations

French Concession Taxpayers' Association Requests; French Municipal Council Reconsiders Donation Reduction

The French Concession Municipal Council decided that from this year onwards, employment agencies would have to pay a new monthly donation of six yuan per quarter. Because the agencies were unable to bear this heavy donation, they asked the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association to negotiate with the Municipal Council again. As a result, they agreed to submit it to the board of directors for reconsideration, but this has not yet been realized. Yesterday, the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association again sent a letter to the Municipal Council asking it to submit it to the board of directors for reconsideration and appropriate reduction as soon as possible. The original letter is recorded below: "Respectfully, this case was resolved at the 37th regular meeting of the Association. Regarding the new monthly donation of six yuan per quarter for employment agencies in the French Concession, the Association has repeatedly sent letters to your bureau to explain the real situation of the agencies, which is indeed difficult to bear this heavy donation. We request that you submit it for reconsideration and reduction as soon as possible to show the difficulty of merchants and benefit the donation policy. We also received an oral reply from Chinese Director Zhang Jixian, saying that the spring donation of eight yuan for employment agencies cannot be reduced. In addition to asking for payment as usual, it can be submitted to the board of directors for reconsideration and appropriate reduction in the future. Each agency also knows this procedure and immediately followed this resolution and presented the spring donation of six yuan with effort a week ago. As for the reduction in the future, we still hope that your bureau will include it on the agenda at the next board meeting and approve the reconsideration and exemption, which is really convenient for the public. Respectfully to the French Concession Municipal Council."

### Wang Nanxiang's Fraud Appeal Instructed to Await Investigation and Summons of Witnesses

Wang Nanxiang, a native of Yixing, is 26 years old this year and has no residence in Shanghai. On August 8 last year, he falsely claimed to be the owner of Yixing Sun Huanan Coal Mine Company and signed a mining contract in Shanghai with Chuan Xiangmei, a native of Yancheng, who lived at No. 31 Tongkang Lane, Rue Sainte-Marie. He then defrauded Chuan of 150 yuan for activity expenses. On November 4 of the same year, Chuan introduced him to Wang Jinji to sign a coal transportation contract and collected a deposit of 100 yuan. Afterwards, after Chuan and Wang learned that Wang was impersonating and defrauding and had no mining business, they wanted to find Wang to reason with him. Wang absconded because he owed rent and meal money to Dazhong Apartment on Rue Paul Beau. Chuan and others reported to the French Police Station and requested investigation and arrest. On March 6 of this year, Wang came to Shanghai again and was arrested by the investigators and sent to the Second Special Court. The Police Department filed a public prosecution according to law. After the trial was concluded, Wang Nanxiang was sentenced to six months of fixed-term imprisonment for continuous fraud and deprivation of public rights for two years. Wang refused to accept the judgment and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court. Yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Wu Tingqi and Assessors Chen and Wang held a hearing in the Third Criminal Division. Lawyer Yao Zhaodi appeared in court on behalf of the Police Department. The appellant stated the reasons for the appeal, denied fraud, and claimed that it was a loan with a promissory note. He had published a statement about the coal mine and presented the newspaper to the court. The court also summoned the plaintiff Chuan Xiangmei and the investigating officers for questioning. The court ordered to await investigation and summons of witnesses and scheduled another hearing. The appellant was still remanded.

### Tang Sun Abuses Maid and is Fined

Clothes Good, Scars Faded; Fined 100 Yuan

Tang Sun, the mistress of the Jinlu Machinery Store at No. 110 Yalu Road (from Wuxi), recently abused Jin Feng, an 11-year-old maid from Changzhou. She often beat her with bamboo strips. On the morning of the 12th of this month at 9 am, she beat the girl fiercely upstairs for stealing three copper coins. At that time, Zhou Dezhao, the owner of a silk weaving factory in the neighborhood from Hangzhou, went to the store to buy a machine wheel disc. He suddenly heard the miserable cries of a young girl being beaten upstairs. He asked the store clerk about the details and felt very unfair. He reported it to the Chinese police officer on duty at station No. 3233. Liang, a police officer, took the girl downstairs and took her to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. The police chief ordered the girl to be sent to Tongren Hospital, where it was verified that the legs and buttocks were slightly injured. The next morning, the girl was sent to the Preliminary Court of the Special Court. Tang was summoned but did not appear in court. She was advised to send the girl to the Jiliang Institute. Yesterday morning, Inspector Xu Yongyuan of the Police Station summoned Tang Sun to the Third Criminal Division. Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted her for abuse under Article 68 of the Criminal Law and requested investigation. According to the testimony of witness Zhou Dezhao and the girl Jin Feng, the defendant's confession was vague, and the clothes Jin Feng was wearing were still good and the scars had faded. Assessor Zhong Qingchui sentenced Tang Sun to a fine of 100 yuan. If she was to be sentenced to forced labor, it would be calculated at one yuan per day. The girl Jin Feng was still handed over to the Jiliang Institute to be kept.

### Old Age and Faded Beauty, Abandoned Like Worn-Out Shoes; Plaintiff Only Asks for a Full Stomach

Yin Cuidi's Hope is Extremely Low; Dai Yingzhou Has Not Arrived, Permission to Summon Again

Yin Cuidi, a 35-year-old woman from Danyang, currently resides at No. 43 Xintaiping Lane, 16 Pu. She was married in her hometown, but the love was not strong. Unfortunately, the husband died young. The woman remained a widow in her youth. In February of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, she moved to Shanghai. Although she was 30 years old, her charm was not diminished. A neighbor, Dai Yingzhou, was the manager of the branch of the Zhongde Pharmacy on Limalu Road in Nanshi. The close proximity of the neighbors aroused love at first sight. He was extremely attentive and gave birth to love. She gave birth to a daughter named Meili. Unexpectedly, the fruit of love did not lead to a long-term commitment. The love broke down, and Dai ignored Yin. Therefore, Yin hired Lawyer Jiang Yiping to sue the Local Court to award her 100 yuan per month for living expenses. Yesterday, Assessor Wang Yijun held a hearing, but neither party arrived. Lawyer Jiang Yiping appeared in court and said that she was induced to cohabit at the time. He said that his wife had passed away, so she cohabited with him. They lived at No. 78 Shouchang Lane, Fangbanqiao, and later moved to Yanmatou. Recently, because of old age and faded beauty, she was abandoned like worn-out shoes. The lawyer has repeatedly urged him to no avail. Therefore, he requested the mediation court. The official approved another summons, as the defendant had not arrived and no mediation could be held. Lawyer Jiang said that the plaintiff's purpose was only to have a full stomach, and the case could be closed.

### Wu Xin Asks Wu Ruisheng to Confirm the Relationship of Son-in-Law

Mediation Fails; Separate Lawsuit Filed

Wu Xin, a local youth from Dongjie, Gaoqiao, Pudong, 20 years old, hired Lawyer Yan Yinwu to sue Wu Ruisheng, No. 78, at the Local Court Mediation Court, to confirm the relationship of son-in-law. The complaint stated that the plaintiff, originally named Guo Jinlong, was the son of Guo Tang. When he was twelve years old (ie, the 18th year of the Republic of China), Zhang Baosheng was asked to mediate, and the mother agreed to be adopted as a son and son-in-law. He was adopted as an adopted son and matched with his biological daughter Wu Zhongying, named Wu Xin, for eight years. They have lived in peace and harmony. The plaintiff has now grown up and learned a profession and is planning to hold a wedding. The defendant was suddenly blinded and made a statement in the newspaper claiming to sever the relationship of adopted son. After the petitioner saw the newspaper, he asked him, and he still claimed that he had declared to sever the relationship of adopted son and did not recognize him as a son-in-law. He was forced to file a petition to summon the case for mediation to confirm that the two parties have an adopted son and son-in-law relationship, etc. Yesterday, Special Assessor Wang Run held a hearing. Because the defendant did not arrive, the order to mediate failed and an official lawsuit was filed.

Invitations were sent out in advance, and most of those invited are judges, prosecutors, and officials from various courts in the city, followed by relatives of both parties. Few ordinary friends were invited, as both parties are judges and, even though they are holding a wedding ceremony, they do not wish to associate with people outside the legal profession, fearing it might affect their duties.

### Husband and Wife or Cohabitation? Conflicting Testimonies from Both Parties

To be Handed Over to the Court for Questioning

Chen Yiyuan, 27 years old, from Zhuji, residing at No. 8 Kongjia Lane in the city, married a woman surnamed Chai from Yuhang when he was in his hometown. Last year, he brought her to Shanghai and opened a Red Gang gambling den on Guling Road. However, due to business failures, he originally planned to send Ms. Chai back to their hometown. Unexpectedly, Ms. Chai did not want to return and found life in Shanghai difficult. Therefore, on the 26th day of the twelfth month of the lunar calendar, she ran away from her husband without a trace. As fate would have it, she encountered Zhuang Zudong from Ningbo in front of the Sincere Company department store. They fell in love at first sight and poured out their hearts to each other. Zhuang, who owned the Haiwei Shenzhuang seafood store at No. 105 Zhonghua Road, was recently widowed. Upon inquiring, Ms. Chai claimed that her husband had passed away. Thus, the lonely woman and the widower moved into a hotel room and cohabited for three days before going to Ningbo for her to become a member of his household. This spring, they came to Shanghai, while Chen had been searching everywhere for her. Until yesterday afternoon around 5:00 PM, he found Ms. Chai and their child and forced her to return with him. However, Ms. Chai denied that Chen was her husband, claiming only a cohabiting relationship. This led to a dispute, and she beat Chen severely, tearing his clothes. Zhuang called the police officer Guo Qingyun, who brought them all to the Yimiao Police Station. According to Chen Yiyuan's statement, Ms. Chai was indeed his wife, and they had a wedding ceremony in their hometown. According to Ms. Chai, her husband, surnamed Shen, was already dead, and she only had a cohabiting relationship with Chen, and she wished to live with the man named Zhuang. As both parties have conflicting statements, they are to be handed over to the court for questioning.

### Husband Beat Wife for Regulating Menstruation, Resulting in Injury

Zhao Guoguang Used Violence

Zhao Guoguang, 24 years old, from Taizhou, is the owner of the Gongdelin Vegetable Restaurant at No. 40, Lane 41, Park Road, where he works as an accountant. He married a woman named Ge Juqing two months ago. Recently, Zhao discovered that his wife was suffering from irregular menstruation. He bought several doses of medicine to regulate her menstruation and ordered her to take it. On the afternoon of the 14th of this month, around 2:00 PM, Zhao believed that his wife was not following his orders, leading to a dispute, followed by violence. Ms. Ge reported to the Xinzha Police Station that she had been beaten and injured by her husband. Yesterday morning, the lawyer Zhang Shizhu from the Public Works Department filed a public prosecution against Zhao in the First Special District Court on the charge of assault. Judge Ye Shengchao presided over the second criminal court, and the defendant was also summoned and arrived at court with his lawyer, Zhu Chengdong, to await questioning. After Judge Ye questioned both the plaintiff and the defendant, he adjourned the hearing for seven days for further investigation.

### Two Cases of Police Raids on Spurious Aphrodisiacs

Yonghua Pharmacy at No. 512 Tianjin Road was selling a product called "Weilishesheng," and the wording in its advertisements seemed to imply that the drug had aphrodisiac effects. The Public Safety Bureau, which strictly prohibits the sale of aphrodisiacs, conducted a raid. However, after testing, it was determined that the drug did not contain any aphrodisiac ingredients and was clearly deceiving others. Therefore, a public prosecution was filed against the pharmacy owner, Luo Huaji, in the First Special District Court, as previously reported in this newspaper. The "Bushen Qiangjing Wan" sold by Guizhou Pharmacy at No. 107 Guizhou Road also claimed in its advertisements that it could provide excitement and endurance. The police also raided the pharmacy and seized 99 bottles. However, testing also revealed no aphrodisiac ingredients. Therefore, the police filed a public prosecution against Qin Songtao, the owner of Guizhou Pharmacy, for fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday morning, Judge Ye Shengqi of the First Special District Court opened the second criminal court to hear the case. The defendant, Qin Songtao, also hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. After the police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, presented the facts of the prosecution, the defendant argued that the drug was indeed a kidney tonic, as proven by a doctor's certificate and testing. He submitted the certificate and test report as evidence. The police requested a postponement of the case, and Judge Ye approved the request, adjourning the hearing for one week.

### Jing Youmei Sues Lin Tianji for Abandonment, Summons Undeliverable

Court Approves Service by Public Notice

Lin Tianji, the deputy director of the accounting department of the Central Bank, over forty years old, cohabited with Jing Youmei (currently 22 years old) from Huzhou at No. 130 Baoshanli, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, and had a son named Lin Zhongzheng, currently four years old. Lin abandoned them and did not care for them. Jing Youmei sued Lin in front of the district court prosecutor, saying that Lin Tianji has neglected to provide necessary protection and support to someone who can't take care of themselves so she filed a public prosecution. However, Lin Tianji never appeared in court and the trial was suspended. The case was ordered to be investigated. Now Jing Youmei is asking for 100 yuan a month to raise Lin Zhongzheng, until he is 20 years old, or 23,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen opened the court and Jing Youmei attended the court and claimed, "I started dating Lin Tianji in 1933, I was 18 years old, and studying at Huiling Middle School, I was introduced to Lin by two women, Shen and Hu. He said that his wife had died and we started dating with plans of getting married. Later I was seduced to have relations and we cohabitated in Beisichuan Road and I got pregnant. The following year Lin Zhongzheng was born in Huzhou Gospel Hospital, and all expenses were covered by Lin Tianji. Last year I discovered that Lin's wife was still alive, so Lin and I had an argument and he abandoned us. I sued Lin for abandonment in your court, but Lin never showed up and the case was ordered to be investigated. My parents were against my relationship with Lin after I met Lin and so I cannot go home and I am just borrowing money every day, and I have a child to take care of." The court ruled, "The defendant has not been summoned and according to his family he is in Guangdong." The plaintiff's lawyer requested "service by public notice," and the court approved it.

He cooperated with a Western detective and rushed to the scene, waiting near a public stove. After a while, the group arrived and were arrested by the Chinese and Western detectives and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the circumstances and said that the four defendants, including Wang Zhaoquan, had committed many robberies in the International Settlement and requested a postponement.

### Three Drug Offenders Sentenced Separately

The Highest Sentence is Fifteen Years

The Yulin Road Police Station's Chinese and Western detectives seized 94 red pills and 20 small bags of heroin. They said that the drugs were purchased from Zhou Wangshi, a woman from Nanjing, in a straw hut on Longjiang Road. The woman was arrested also and taken to the First Special District Court. She resolutely denied the charges. At the end of the interrogation, Judge Zhong presided in court yesterday morning and sentenced Dai Changren to 12 years and 6 months, Gao Ziliang to 15 years, and Zhou Xiaoqing to 2 years. Zhou Wangshi was reprimanded, and the evidence was confiscated.

### Chen Zemin Accused of Colluding to Defraud Funds by Selling Land

Zhu Zhangshi Denies Chen Sold the Land

The first defendant, Chen Zemin, a lawyer, was not present at yesterday's trial. Previously, he sold 1 fen and 6 li of land located near Qiwupu Road, Yangshupu, owned by a woman named Zhu Zhangshi, to Zuo Yaoqing, an old man living on Cengzhou Road who served as the director of a mapping company. Later, Zuo was unable to manage the land and negotiated for a long time without resolution. Now, he has hired lawyer Le Junying to file a criminal lawsuit against Chen Zemin and Zhu Zhangshi for colluding to defraud funds. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Pan of the First Special District Court opened the trial. Only the defendant Zhu Zhangshi appeared. According to the plaintiff Zuo Yaoqing, the land was purchased on March 5 of the previous year by him on behalf of the Public Works Department from Chen Zemin. The introducer, Shen Fengting, said that the land originally belonged to Zhu Zhangshi and that she had given it to Chen as a reward for his legal services. Therefore, he only dealt with Chen. The land price was 3,800 yuan, which he paid, and Chen gave him the land deed to collect the land license from the Land Bureau. No other contract was established. Unexpectedly, Zhu Zhangshi had other disputes with others regarding the purchased land. She denied that Chen had sold the land, and the land license has not been received to this day. He has repeatedly questioned Chen Zemin, who has always been evasive. Therefore, he is suing the two defendants for colluding to defraud him. Judge Pan questioned Zhu Zhangshi and adjourned the hearing for another day.

### Wu and Zhao Settle Their Fight

### Fei Junwen Found Not Guilty in the Poisoning of Eighteen People Case

The Powder is Not Poisonous Enough to Kill; Brothers Testify He Would Not Commit Such an Act; Police Abandon Appeal

The late real estate businessman, Fei Keming, a local resident, lived at No. 70 Yuanchangli, Dongyouheng Road, and had four sons and two daughters: Yushēng (eldest), Junwen (second), Bingwen (third), and Meiwén (fourth). Due to property disputes, they had been involved in lawsuits, causing discord among the siblings. Junwen and Meiwén currently live in the old house, each with their own kitchen. On the 2nd of this month, Qingming Festival, Meiwén invited eighteen relatives and friends to lunch at home. After only half a meal, everyone at the table experienced abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. They were rushed to Tongren Hospital, where doctors diagnosed them with poisoning. Fortunately, the symptoms were mild. After treatment, they all recovered and reported the incident to the Huishan Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. The food, soy sauce, and sugar were sent to the Public Works Department for testing, and the results showed that the soy sauce and sugar contained two grams of arsenic. Later, the police found Fei Junwen to be suspicious and, on the morning of the 19th, raided his home with a court warrant and arrested him. They also found nine small packets of powder in his room, along with his chef, Zhou Asan from Yangzhou, and student Xu Zhongshi from Jiangyin, and brought them all to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention, as previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Xiefen presided over the second criminal court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that one of the nine packets of powder tested positive for a small amount of poisonous picric acid, but it was not enough to kill anyone. The investigation revealed that Zhou Asan and Xu Zhongshi were not involved and should be released. The court approved this. Regarding Fei Junwen, he requested a free witness statement. His brother, Fei Meiwén, and his elder brother, Fei Yushēng, testified in succession that, although Junwen had disagreements about the property division and often argued, they did not think he would commit such an act and asked that he not be prosecuted. Fei Junwen stated that he was completely unaware of what had happened in this case and that the powder found was used to treat his child's ear infection. He also hired a lawyer to defend him. Judge Xiao ruled that Fei Junwen was not guilty. The police lawyer, Zhang, abandoned the appeal, and he was immediately released.

### Dispute Over Foremen Leads to Crowd Assault, Broken Legs, and Over Ten Knife Wounds

Zhou Guanghe Covered in Blood; Perpetrator Wang San Immediately Arrested

Changde Oil Factory in Zhangjiabang, Pudong, has been in operation for many years and is quite prosperous. It employs hundreds of workers, both inside and outside, all of whom are under the leadership of foremen. A foreman named Zhou Guanghe from Jiangbei was arrested and imprisoned two years ago on suspicion of being a communist. His foreman position was temporarily filled by Wang San from Shandong. After Zhou regained his freedom, he became a foreman again, and Wang San was left without a job. As a result, the Shandong gang and the Jiangbei gang became increasingly incompatible, often engaging in fights and even involving the court. After a mediator intervened, Wang San was promoted to deputy foreman, but Zhou did not agree, leading to an even deeper resentment. Yesterday (the 27th), after work during lunch, Wang gathered workers from the Shandong gang, each armed with iron rulers and sharp knives, and ambushed Zhou near the factory. Seeing Zhou come out, they surrounded him and beat him severely. Zhou's legs were broken by Wang and others using iron rulers, and he suffered over ten knife wounds all over his body, covered in blood, a gruesome sight to behold. At that time, a patrolling police officer passed by and, hearing the commotion, arrested the main perpetrator, Wang San, along with the weapons, and took them to the police station. Zhou was rushed to the Southeast Hospital for treatment and is likely to be disabled.

### Local Associations News

Baoshan: The Baoshan Sojourners Association in Shanghai, since its establishment, has been planning to build an association hall for three years and is preparing for a free clinic for common people in their hometown to seek the well-being of their hometown. Recently, in order to concentrate the strength of all the sojourners in Shanghai and consolidate the foundation of the association, it has begun to hold the third membership recruitment convention from the 15th of this month. Yesterday, the association's president, Zhang Gongquan, and standing members Jin Juyou and Zhao Zhengping, etc., notified the sojourners to actively join. The membership application methods are as follows: ㊀ Membership fees are divided into five types: A, annual payment of ten yuan; B, annual payment of five yuan; C, annual payment of two yuan; D, annual payment of one yuan; E, annual payment of fifty cents. Those who pay a membership fee of fifty yuan or more at one time will become permanent members. Those who donate more than two hundred yuan for the association's business expenses at one time will become honorary directors and are exempt from paying annual membership fees. ㊁ Each member must be responsible for introducing at least two or more fellow villagers to join the association. ㊂ The solicitation period is limited to the end of May. ㊃ After the solicitation is over, in addition to publishing a special publication by the association, it will also be submitted to the board of supervisors for discussion. Members with achievements will be given honorary and souvenir awards to commend them. ㊄ For all new members recruited, please fill out the membership application form and send it to the association at Puqing Lane, Fujian Road. The association will send personnel to collect the membership fee and issue a receipt and membership certificate.

Shaoxing County: Since the Shaoxing County Sojourners Association in Shanghai moved to Cishu Lane, Yunnan Road, to hold the second membership recruitment convention, more than sixty recruitment teams have been established and the recruitment is proceeding very smoothly. According to a recent statement by the person in charge of the association, the outside world thinks that this association is the Shaoxing Seven Counties Sojourners Association, and even the sojourners themselves have this misunderstanding. Especially in newspaper reports, the word "county" is omitted. Shaoxing Seven Counties refers to the seven counties of the former Shaoxing Prefecture. At that time, the first county of the prefecture was Shanyin and Kuaiji, which is now Shaoxing County. All other counties have long since dropped the name of the prefecture. The outside world often refers to people from Shangyu, Yuyao, Shengxian, Zhuji, and other places as Shaoxing people. This is just a habit that has been passed down from the old system. According to a survey, among the sojourners from Shaoxing County in Shanghai, the most numerous are in the book industry, catering industry, and dyeing industry, followed by the foil industry, money industry, silk shop industry, and cloth industry. There are also many who serve in party and government agencies, and it can be said that there is no industry that is not represented, with an estimated number of more than 100,000 people. In the past two or three years, due to the decline of rural areas in the mainland and changes in the situation of handicrafts, more and more people have come to Shanghai to seek a living as workers and peddlers. Previously, there was no organization, and fellow villagers often criticized each other, thinking that they were not as enthusiastic about public welfare as others, and felt deeply ashamed. In fact, the number of people in the past was not as large as it is now, and the concept of unity was not as strong as it is now, so no one proposed it, and even if someone proposed it, few would join. Now, due to the needs of the environment, especially workers and small business owners, they feel the need for a fellow villager group even more, because they are most easily subjected to the encroachment of evil forces. Therefore, at the beginning of the establishment of this association, there were more than 700 members, most of whom were shop assistants and workers. In the past two years, most of the membership applications accepted have also been for this type of member. However, although this association has been determined to be pragmatic and serve the fellow villagers as much as possible, regardless of class and treating everyone equally, it must also depend on its strength, because this association has a short history and limited economic strength. It is hoped that fellow villagers will uphold the spirit of universal love and mutual assistance and join quickly to increase the efficiency of this association's work. It is also heard that this membership recruitment convention is scheduled to close in mid-May, and the teams are competing for results and striving to recruit members. There are also many who directly apply to the association for membership. It is expected that the results of this convention will be satisfactory.

Hu She: Established for thirteen years, the association's affairs are developing rapidly, and it has established offices in Wuxing, Nanjing, and Wuhan. It is now heard that the Hangzhou office is being actively prepared by Zhang Xuren, Xu Qianfu, Zhang Zishan, Xu Enpei, Ling Yingru, Shen Kecheng, Chen Shiying, and others, and will be established soon. The founding meeting is scheduled to be held on May 2 at the Huzhou Sojourners Association in Amitabha Lane, Hangzhou.

Pudong: The Sojourners Association is scheduled to travel to Chuansha, Nanhui, Xinchang, Zhoupu, and other places on May 2 to solicit fellow villagers to participate. The fee is two yuan per person. The deadline is May 2 at 6:00 am. Gather at the Bund outside Edward Road and take the city ferry to Qingning Temple, then transfer to a special bus from Shangchuan Company to Chuansha first. Those who wish to participate can register at the association before the 20th.

### Hu Sheng Sues Li Shunsheng and Others for Mistaking a Defendant

Wang Zhenli Was Training and Did Not Know the Truth; the Defendant Did Not Appear Before Going to Court

Hu Xin'nan, the daughter of Hu Sheng, a woman from Pudong, is twenty years old this year. When she was nine years old, through matchmaker Li Shunsheng and others, she was betrothed to Jin Song, the son of the late Li Quanlin of Sunjiazhai, Donggou, Pudong, but they have not yet married. However, because her husband opened a car rental business on Xiahe Road in Xiamen, the whole family lived in Xiamen. This year, during the Qingming Festival, she returned to Shanghai to sweep the tombs in Pudong. Unexpectedly, on the 7th of this month, Li Quanlin's wife and Li Shunsheng, along with the patrol chief of the Lixing District Police Station in Donggou, arrested her and took her to the police station, forcing her to hand over Xin'nan for marriage within twenty days, otherwise she would be detained. Later, her younger brother presented a guarantee for her release, but the guarantee responsibility was still to hand over the person within twenty days. After she went out, she telegraphed to her husband, who was very angry and told her to sue the court immediately. Therefore, she hired lawyer Hu Yuanjun and filed a complaint with the First Special District Court. The defendants she sued were Li Jinlin's wife and Li Shunsheng, as well as the patrol chief of the police station. However, the patrol chief she identified was Patrol Chief Huang (original name Wang Zhenli), but Wang Zhenli was transferred to the training center on the 2nd of this month for training. His patrol chief duties have been taken over by Wei Benshan since the 2nd of this month. However, she still thought it was Wang Zhenli. Therefore, Chen Kangsun, a judge, opened the court yesterday afternoon. She testified that the defendants forced the marriage and violated her freedom. Now, she is not only asking the court to punish them, but also that her daughter is unwilling to marry into the Li family as a daughter-in-law and has filed a separate lawsuit to dissolve the marriage contract. At this point, Patrol Chief Wang Zhenli claimed that he had been ordered to transfer to the training center for training on the 2nd of this month, and his original duties were replaced by Wei Benshan, so he did not know anything about it. He has served in Pudong for more than ten years and would never dare to do such illegal things, and has never been at fault. It is indeed a mistake on her part and he cannot be held responsible for others. Please investigate. Li Quanlin's wife and Li Shunsheng were not summoned to appear in court. Hu Sheng said that when she arrived at the court just now, she saw them all in front of the court. The judge then ordered the bailiff to accompany her to find the defendants to appear in court, but the defendants had already left. Therefore, the court ordered a rescheduled hearing at 1:00 pm on May 6.

### Increasing the Axis Power Between Italy and Germany

— I

According to a London telegram yesterday, Mussolini and Goering held talks to increase the axis power between Italy and Germany. It is said that the Italian Prime Minister will visit Hitler in Germany this summer. This news has a significant impact on the world situation. Isn't the general view now that the three major fascist countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan are on the same front? But is this understanding accurate? Is it reliable? I think it is still a question.

A few days ago, wasn't there news from Germany that the German leader Hitler was willing to join the world peace conference? At that time, the British and French newspapers were very satisfied and published this unexpected news. At that time, I wanted to write an article to expose the inside story, but because I was busy, I forgot about the issue. Today, seeing this news again, it stirred my heartstrings, so I wrote some small opinions based on my observations.

What is most troubling for all countries now is not Germany or Italy, but the combined power of Germany and Italy, which is considered the most unassailable. If Germany were really willing to participate in negotiations with countries that advocate world peace and join the conference, then Italy would feel isolated and lack strength. Not only would its cherished goals be difficult to achieve, but it would also feel the danger in the future. Therefore, this time Mussolini and Goering held talks to increase the axis power between Italy and Germany. The logic is in this.

But does Germany really want to cooperate with Britain, France, and other countries and break away from Italy? I expect not. Germany wants to participate in the world peace conference, but it is just a statement. On the one hand, it wants to ease the atmosphere in the world, because now all countries in the world are paying too much attention to the actions of Germany and Italy and are too concerned. This time, promoting such an atmosphere is a kind of "eye trick." At the present time, Germany and Italy have become a linked chicken game, and they cannot be separated. On the other hand, Germany cannot help but feel disheartened about Italy's national policy. Italy borrowed Germany's invisible power to seize Abyssinia, and now it wants to seize hegemony in the Mediterranean. If Italy creates supreme power, it will not take Germany seriously, and it will become a situation where two heroes cannot stand together. What is the point of "the mole cricket plowing makes the shoulders hurt, and the curved rafters are made for someone else's house"?

Moreover, although Germany has reorganized its military and restored its right to station troops along the Rhine, it has not yet achieved anything by advocating the recovery of lost territory. If Italy creates new power, Germany may not be able to recover its lost territory, because the strength of a neighboring country is not a blessing for the country. This also cannot be ignored. But now Germany and Italy are still in a period of mutual use and have not reached the point of splitting. However, this period will definitely come. The talks between Mussolini and Goering have already shown that Germany and Italy cannot cooperate in the end. Therefore, the proposal to increase the axis power of the two countries and to have a meeting with Hitler for discussion is obvious.

### Shooting Lepers

— Yunhai

In the newspaper on the 21st, there were two news items about lepers. The Nanjing telegram said, "The Guangdong Provincial Government is arresting lepers and plans to shoot more than 140 seriously ill people to avoid infection. Legislator Ye Xiasheng telegraphed the Guangdong Provincial authorities, saying that he did not know what articles of civil law or criminal law this move was based on. In any case, it is by no means the action of a civilized race. I hope not to reverse the trend and create a strange event unprecedented in ancient and modern times at home and abroad." The Guangzhou telegram said, "The Guangdong authorities plan to build a large-scale leprosarium and decided to allocate 100,000 yuan from the Department of Finance for construction costs." These two telegrams seem to be too far apart. The truth is unknown. However, since this issue has been raised, we might as well talk about it.

Leprosy is a unique disease in Fujian and Guangdong. Although I have not studied medicine, I am quite familiar with this disease because I have lived in the south for a long time. This disease can be said to be a very serious infectious disease, and its spread is very wide. For those who suffer from this disease, it can be said to be a lifelong pain without reliable treatment now. However, some lepers have been fooled by vulgar doctors and think that "leprosy" can be "sold". Therefore, in remote rural areas, there are often news of "leprous people raping passers-by" and other "selling leprosy" incidents. Therefore, in terms of social security, the disposal of lepers is indeed a very important issue.

Although lepers are harmful to society, it is not entirely true if we think that shooting lepers can "eliminate harm". Dealing with a matter is not to think that simple and straightforward is a "good thing" and feasible. Especially in the modern era of scientific progress, we should not use unscientific means to casually deal with the lives of some people, even if they are disabled.

Of course, needless to say, there are no clauses in any laws that sentence a person with a serious illness to death; even in terms of humanity, it does not seem to be very justifiable. Taking a step back, we cannot immediately cure the patient, but we should be able to come up with educational methods to change the patient's psychology. A disabled person is not necessarily a mediocre person or a useless person. From an educational point of view, we may also be able to change their psychology, make them forget the pain of being disabled, and wholeheartedly study what they love to study. This achievement is inevitable and certain to surpass. Isn't this a thousand times better than the method of destroying their lives? Of course, this requires a sum of money, and it requires dedicated personnel to work hard and study the methods and means of this special education. However, this is ultimately the responsibility of this society! Easily ending a person's life by "avoiding the heavy and taking the light" is unreasonable in any respect.

Finally, I hope that the news of "shooting lepers" is a rumor, and that "building a large-scale leprosarium" is absolutely true. Because we have not yet given general officials the right to shoot patients with serious illnesses!

### A Brief Account of the Sichuan Disaster

— Shishi

My friend Mr. Qiu recently came from Sichuan and told me about the real situation of the Sichuan disaster. I feel that the newspapers in Shanghai cannot describe even one-tenth of the disaster situation in the local area. In particular, the fact that the victims are competing to eat "Guanyin soil" can be said to be "extremely tragic". I can't help but shed tears, so I briefly record a few examples to share with those who care about the Sichuan disaster.

The scope of the disaster in Sichuan this time and the number of victims are not only incomparable to other provinces, but also unprecedented in decades. Since the Min and Tuo rivers flooded last summer, the fields have all become swamps. Then, the armyworms were rampant and the epidemic spread. After autumn, not a drop of rain fell, causing an unprecedented drought. And the natural disasters were not enough, but also added to the bandit disasters. Therefore, the composition of the Sichuan disaster can be said to be a combination of water, drought, insects, and bandits. Mr. Qiu trades in Chengdu, and sometimes travels around for business. What he sees along the way is often a thousand miles of barren land and starving people dying on the road. The severity of the disaster is really unimaginable. For example, Chongqing and Chengdu, which are the areas with the lightest disaster in the province, have recently been investigated: the total number of starving people who died on the road in January and February of this year has exceeded thousands. This kind of tragic news will really make people speechless.

The people of Sichuan have been without food for several months. Since the beginning of the new year, they have not tasted the taste of rice and wheat for a long time. At first, they still ate some chaff and bran to fill their stomachs; soon they used grass roots and bark to fill their hunger. Some also boiled cotton and pasted straw paper to get a full meal. Finally, when the plants were eaten up, they had to turn their attention to minerals; and the mineral that could be used as food was the so-called "white mud". In Jianchang, Yongning, Jialing, and other places, white mud has long become a common food for the people. This kind of soil,

Although it is called white mud, its color is not pure white, but slightly black; its texture is fine and tough, and it congeals into blocks. It is crushed into powder. The victims use white mud to quench their hunger, knowing that it is drinking poison to quench thirst, but only to prolong their lives. But as the saying goes, "it is better to live badly than to die well." They always want to find a way to live one more day. As for whether white mud can be digested? Are there any harms? No one cares about that. Therefore, white mud has become their only blessing in life. Mr. Qiu said humorously, "In the dictionary of us Sichuan people, the word 'grain' should be changed to have the earth radical." This is a very painful joke.

White mud is also called "Guanyin soil". The origin of the name is that a legend is popular in the Neijiang area: because white mud is not seen at ordinary times, it is attributed to Guanyin Bodhisattva, believing that the Bodhisattva is compassionate and specially gives white mud to save the victims. Therefore, every time white mud is found, it is mostly said to be a dream shown by Guanyin, or Guanyin showing his spirit.

The production of Guanyin soil is not like ordinary soil, which can be taken endlessly and used inexhaustibly; moreover, under a large demand, it is even more insufficient to supply. With "less mud and more people", all kinds of disputes occur among the victims. In Meishan, the hometown of Mr. Su Dongpo, two villages recently had a fierce fight due to a dispute over the white mud hidden in the nearby mountains. As a result, both sides suffered many deaths and injuries. It is said that this kind of tragedy of struggling on the line of death will happen at any time in the disaster area. Since white mud is not easy to come by, the victims are happy to eat it. However, the quality of white mud has no nutritional value at all. It only fills the empty stomach. In fact, it does not have the effect of filling hunger and resisting starvation. Therefore, their life of eating soil cannot be relied on to prolong life. Probably, at most, in less than one or two weeks, they will have yellow skin, swollen bodies, and collapse and die. Those who are poisoned by impure soil are even more numerous. In a mountain near Luzhou, a farmer was bitten to death by a tiger, and his chest and abdomen were eaten away. A day or two later, someone suddenly saw that the tiger had died in the valley. Vomit was all over the ground beside the corpse, and human flesh and soil were in a mess. Only then did they know that tigers were also not used to eating mud and died of poisoning. "Even tigers are like this, how can humans bear it"!

As for the matter of eating human flesh and exchanging children for food in the disaster area, it is also commonplace. In the Minjiang area, human flesh also has a fixed price, as high as half a yuan per catty. I cannot bear to write about this kind of tragedy anymore.

### Leaving the Old Residence

— Lin Jia

When I came out of the house, I saw the sunflowers in front of the window. Every spring, although no one planted these sunflowers, they always grew out with the grass. When the gardener came to weed, I told them to be careful and not to hoe them away. After finishing, I often took some time to water them. When they grew up, I cut down the leaves next to them, and I also pulled out the grass near the roots by hand. Every morning when I got up, I had to see if they were safe. When autumn came, they bloomed with yellow flowers as big as sea bowls, and the inside was full of dense seeds, happily facing the sun. When I came, it seemed to nod and salute me. When I left, it seemed to bow and see me off. At this time, my heart felt a star of warmth and joy.

The dense locust forest covered this gray small house. I haven't left it for three years. At the small table under the glass window, I was once immersed in the poetic realm of "Quiet thatched eaves, dim reed window lamps, late spring with river winds and rain. Orioles and swallows are silent, but the cuckoo often cries in the moonlit night." Now, with a sad heart, I am going to bid farewell to that quiet life.

Passing through a narrow gate, the shadow of the locust forest was also blocked. In this forest, magpies with long tails are always chirping on the branches all year round. In spring and summer, in this quiet courtyard, many unknown flocks of birds with beautiful feathers often fly in, singing pleasant songs. In the grass under the trees, there are all kinds of grasshoppers hidden. Sometimes, when I am too bored alone, I also catch one or two and tie them up with a thread to play with. Every day at dawn, I have to stand in the grass full of dewdrops, and hold up my chest to the rising sun, deeply inhaling the air full of grass fragrance.

Arriving at the steps of the middle courtyard, there are two trees that hang dense grapes in autumn. Like dragon turtles, they bend and coil, covered with tender green leaves. Fish tanks are arranged in rows below, and goldfish swim leisurely in the water. There are often two greedy dogs standing beside them waiting for a chance.

Walking out of the gate, stepping on the familiar path that I take every day, saying hello to me with the words I usually say every day, the beggar woman who begs for money on the side of the road still directs her little son to chase after the passers-by, the couples in the park are still holding up flower umbrellas and revealing slender arms, and high heels are coming and going. The clear blue sky is as usual dotted with a few white clouds. Everything is the same as in the past, but my mood of saying goodbye is only nostalgic and sad for this old residence.
