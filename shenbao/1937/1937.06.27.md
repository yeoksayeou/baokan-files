[Hong Kong] Li Zongren, along with Huang Zhongyue, an overseas Chinese, and Li Cixi, a senior staff officer of the Fifth Route Army, arrived in Guangzhou at 11:30 AM on the 26th, aboard a Guangdong airplane dispatched by Yu Hanmou. Song Ziwen, Yu Hanmou, Wu Tiecheng, Xiang Hanping, and Zeng Yangfu, among others, were all present at the Tianhe Airport to greet them. They then proceeded to the guesthouse for rest. After lunch, Li and Huang held closed-door talks with Song Ziwen on the second floor, discussing the following issues: ㊀ the exchange rate between Guangxi currency and national currency; ㊁ the recall of Guangxi currency and the adoption of national currency; ㊂ the handover of Guangxi national taxes to central management; and ㊃ the handover of Guangxi silver to central reception. Regarding the exchange rate between Guangxi currency and national currency, Li hoped to set it at an additional 6%. Li also intended to discuss Guangxi military and political issues with Song. Li decided to stay in Guangzhou for several days to negotiate with Song, hence Song postponed his return to the North. Before Li met with Song, he mentioned that his visit was to discuss reorganizing Guangxi's finances with Zhu, and the central government had decided to issue public bonds for reorganization purposes, but the amount and methods were yet to be determined. Yu will stay in Guangzhou for a few days before returning to Guangxi. Bai is currently inspecting Wuzhou, and military affairs are being handled by Li Pinxian. Li Xici also mentioned that the exchange rate between Guangdong currency and silver dollars was set at an additional 44%, which Guangxi considered too high. Li also cited a telegram from Chiang, stating that all Guangxi issues could be discussed with Song in person in Guangzhou, hence Li made a special trip to Guangzhou. Guangxi currency slightly increased on the 26th, valued at approximately 67% of Guangdong currency. (26th Special Dispatch)

[Tianjin] Tajiri visited Kato Inji and Biraejin in Beiping on the 26th, then met with Horiuchi and returned to Shanghai by night train. (26th Special Dispatch)

[Nanjing] The official here has remained silent regarding the remarks made by Japanese Ambassador to China Kawagoe Shigeru to reporters on the 24th, as they have not yet seen the original text. However, the general public has expressed disappointment. Kawagoe stated that Japan has given China a new understanding, but those familiar with the diplomatic situation believe that Japan's actions in China are not much different from a year ago. The so-called new understanding seems to be merely lip service, lacking substantial expression in reality. Japan's rights to survival and development should certainly be respected, but these rights should be limited to not infringing upon or hindering the survival and development of other countries, as other countries also have the right to survive and develop. The essence of the self-existence and co-existence policy advocated by the Chinese lies in this. Ambassador Kawagoe's statement that "the current state of North China exists to adapt to the inevitable destiny of the existence and development of Manchukuo" is particularly worrying to the Chinese. "Manchukuo" is an illegal organization, and China has repeatedly declared its non-recognition, and the League of Nations also has a resolution of non-recognition. To compare it with North China raises endless doubts among the world about Japan's intentions in North China. Ambassador Kawagoe stated that Sino-Japanese economic cooperation should be negotiated with the central and local governments depending on its nature. This is incompatible with the principle of national diplomatic sovereignty and still carries the implication of "divide and rule." As for the so-called Tanggu Truce, it was a response to a temporary and special environment. Now that the environment no longer exists, it should be abolished as soon as possible to eliminate psychological obstacles between the Chinese and Japanese people and promote the rapid investigation of the relations between the two countries. Although the stationing of foreign troops along the Beiping-Hai railway line is based on the Boxer Protocol, the provisions of the protocol have their fixed meaning and limitations and should not be arbitrarily invoked. Japan's current deployment of a large number of troops in North China clearly exceeds the meaning and scope of the Boxer Protocol and causes significant stimulation to the Chinese people. In general, it is believed that when the new Japanese cabinet was established and Ambassador Kawagoe returned to China, he must have had new policies different from those of the past to cope with the new situation in Sino-Japanese relations. Kawagoe's expression now is such that it seems to darken the future of Sino-Japanese relations and is deeply regrettable. However, Ambassador Kawagoe has stated that he will take strict measures to crack down on the operation of drug trafficking, which may be a somewhat satisfactory point.

### Our Country's Basic Attitude Towards British-Japanese Negotiations

Respect for China's Sovereignty, Territory, and Administrative Integrity; China's Opinions Must Be Solicited and Consent Obtained in Advance

[Nanjing] The British-Japanese negotiations are about to be held. Our country's officials are unwilling to make premature predictions about the future of these negotiations. However, as British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons yesterday that any understanding in the British-Japanese negotiations will not sacrifice China's interests, and eminent figures in the opposition, such as Lord Lytton, former chairman of the League of Nations Manchuria Investigation Commission, told British reporters that any proposal to recognize "Manchukuo" must be opposed. This is satisfactory to all parties here. It can be seen from these statements that in this British-Japanese negotiation involving East Asian issues, Britain will certainly rely on its own public opinion, based on the spirit of friendship between China and Britain, in accordance with the principles of the League of Nations covenant and the resolutions of the League of Nations, and proceed with caution. According to influential figures in diplomatic circles, there are two points in our country's basic attitude towards these negotiations that must be given special attention: that is, when referring to Chinese matters, China's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and administrative integrity must be respected, and China's opinions must be solicited in advance and China's consent must be obtained.

The matter was completed on the 26th and they returned to Suiyuan. Recently, the places where Shi and others distributed relief were Bailin Temple, Xilamuren Temple (i.e., Dazhao Temple), Hadong Temple, and Pan Wangfu.

The lamas of Bailin Temple were more severely affected by the disaster, and each person was given 10 yuan in relief funds. 7,000 yuan was allocated from the relief funds for the repair of Bailin Temple. Shi had already estimated the construction costs at the temple, and the commander of the garrison regiment, Deng Chongxi, and Supervisor of Education Sha Beixue will start construction within days.

If the Far East is to no longer be a dangerous area, an agreement must be negotiated that can be accepted by all parties involved in order to find a solution. (Reuters, 25th)

### Britain Increases Exchange Equalization Fund; Foreign Exchange Markets Unsurprised

Rumors of the French Franc's Value Being Allowed to Float Freely

[London] Foreign exchange brokers were not surprised to hear the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir John Simon, announce in the House of Commons that the British Exchange Equalization Fund would be increased by £200 million. They generally believe this move is inevitable because the original fund was blocked by gold and insufficient for operations. The fate of French finance is currently uncertain. At this time, the U.S. government has conveniently resolved to increase its Exchange Equalization Fund. Speculation naturally arises that this move may be related to the French government's proposed steps to restore the French economy. Some quarters firmly believe that the new French Finance Minister, Georges Bonnet, will allow the French franc to determine its own price, considering it better to let it float freely than to devalue it repeatedly. The reason is that adopting a laissez-faire approach may cause speculators to abandon their wait-and-see policy. If the French government makes this decision and supplements it with active remedial measures, it may be possible to reverse the outflow of French capital and revive French finances. Other countries that have signed the Tripartite Monetary Agreement would likely tacitly approve this change in French policy, as this change is equivalent to adopting a path that the UK has already effectively implemented. However, the franc's liquidity will inevitably promote capital flight in the short term. Fortunately, today's increase in the UK's equalization fund is sufficient to cope with this impact and has ample leeway. (Central News Agency, 25th, Reuters)

Shanxi's National Defense and Economic Construction: Two Characteristics - Emphasis on "Favorable Balance of Trade" and "Centralized Management"

The goal of economic construction, as highlighted by the Shanxi authorities, is to enhance the strength of "national defense economy." However, their understanding of the term "national defense economy" is somewhat peculiar and perhaps overly simplistic. They believe that the strength of a nation is largely determined by its economic prosperity, and the sole criterion for determining wealth is the contrast between "unfavorable balance of trade" and "favorable balance of trade." Therefore, the most important step for a country to become strong is to first achieve self-sufficiency in industrial and commercial goods, and then sell these goods to foreign countries. (Mr. Yan Xishan once said, "Today's pyramid of nation-building is selling goods. All kinds of facilities in various countries are designed to promote the policy of selling goods.") Reducing imports and increasing exports to achieve a "favorable balance of trade" will make the country "rich," and therefore "strong." How to reduce imports and increase exports? They believe there are only two ways: first, to raise tariff barriers; and second, to promote the use of domestic goods. (Shanxi has a special term for these two methods, called "non-rational economic national defense." But before reaching the rational stage, it can only be used as a last resort for self-defense. "Rational economic national defense," however, is barter trade, exchanging what one has for what one needs.) The issue of increasing tariffs is not within the responsibility of Shanxi Province alone, and the reporter did not hear any specific opinions from them on this matter. As for the promotion of using local goods, they explained it this way: "What we really mean is to use domestic goods. However, the term 'domestic goods' is too vague for the general public, making it difficult to implement. A more practical approach is to start with using 'local goods.' Each county in the province should preferably use local goods, and each province should use provincial goods. The result will be using domestic goods. When each province and each county can be self-sufficient and achieve a favorable balance of trade, the result will be national self-sufficiency and a national favorable balance of trade, thus achieving 'economic national defense.'" - This is their consistent theoretical system.

The country is a whole, and the nation is a unified entity. No individual part can independently control its own prosperity and strength. The more advanced a nation is, the stronger this organic nature becomes. This is almost common knowledge. Therefore, it would be a misunderstanding to think that the Shanxi authorities do not recognize this point and are still advocating for "self-sufficiency of one province." In Mr. Yan Xishan's conversation with the reporter mentioned earlier, he had already expressed this very clearly. The reason for this misunderstanding is because people only hear the various terms used by Shanxi without understanding their special understanding of these terms. More importantly, they do not recognize its most fundamental spirit of emphasizing "favorable balance of trade."

When Shanxi initially intensified its control over public enterprises, doubts about "competing with the people for profit" were quite prevalent throughout the country and within Shanxi Province itself. At that time, the Shanxi authorities repeatedly explained to everyone in detail. First, they distinguished between the terms "righteousness" and "profit": "Benefiting oneself is profit; benefiting others is righteousness." They believed that all modern national political facilities are aimed at seeking the welfare of all the people. The term "competing with the people for profit" has no place to exist. They also cited several advantages of public enterprises to persuade those in society who misunderstood. The advantages cited were: ㊀ Factories and shops still employ workers and merchants to operate, and for them, their occupations remain the same, and their salaries are better than under private management. ㊁ For the industrial and commercial enterprises themselves, public operation is easier to develop. ㊂ For capitalists, lending capital to public enterprises can not only avoid major losses due to economic panic but also obtain considerable and stable interest. ㊃ Most importantly, it transforms the evil practice of capitalists exploiting workers' interests for their own extravagance and dissipation into a resource for national development, prosperity, and civilization. Therefore, Mr. Yan Xishan once said with great emotion, "Now, it is surprisingly regarded as competing with the people for profit based on erroneous old concepts, which is truly regrettable! If this kind of old concept is not eradicated, it will not only hinder national development, social progress, and people's happiness, but also the great sacrifice of more than forty years of bloodshed for the Three Principles of the People revolution will become an illusory bubble."

In the past year or so, doubts about "competing with the people for profit" seem to be rarely heard within Shanxi Province itself. However, in other places, it still cannot be eliminated. And the explanation of the Shanxi authorities mentioned above is still just general principles in the reporter's personal view. These principles still cannot fully explain why and how Shanxi can strengthen its control over public enterprises. Therefore, it cannot eliminate the impression of "competing with the people for profit" from people elsewhere regarding its measures in recent years. Therefore, here, the reporter would like to point out an objective fact in Shanxi's environment based on the findings of the investigation, which is: Shanxi's capital is relatively concentrated in the hands of a small number of capitalists. And most of these capitalists are figures related to politics. On the one hand, large enterprises cannot be established without their investment; on the other hand, without their investment, all large enterprises cannot actually be established. In the past, most of Shanxi's large enterprises were operated with their investment. Whether to intensify control or not does not make much difference in the actual situation. If we hear terms such as "public operation" and "intensifying control" and think that it means competing with the people for profit, that is a superficial view. Assuming that the Shanxi authorities hold the intention of "competing with the people for profit," then they do not need to rely on these methods of "public operation" and "intensifying control." Looking deeper, the purpose of these measures is partly to open up various enterprises, absorb private capital, and carry out intensified construction. Therefore, in the so-called "Board of Directors of Public Enterprises," the highest agency for overall planning, although half of the directors are official figures, there are also many who participate purely as investors. Mr. Yan Xishan himself once said, "Having public enterprises be fully responsible to the Board of Directors is equivalent to all the people of the province using money as shareholders to open a business, electing directors to operate, just like a company, completely separated from political agencies."

If the Shanxi authorities did not have the awareness and determination of national defense, the so-called "public operation," the so-called "strengthening control," etc., would not have appeared, in the reporter's personal opinion. The characteristic of "centralized management" in Shanxi's national defense economic construction is something that we must recognize and deeply contemplate.

### British Prime Minister's Cautious Speech Received Favorably by German Political Circles

Neurath Plans to Visit London Earlier; Negotiations Also Begin Between Britain and Italy

[London] Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons today, appealing for a cautious and patient attitude for the sake of European peace and praising Germany for considering the overall situation by seeing the Leipzig case as closed, has aroused a favorable impression in Berlin political circles and has largely dispelled the negative feelings caused by foreign press commentary on Germany's withdrawal from the naval patrol plan. Berlin even said that as a result of the American Prime Minister's speech, German Foreign Minister Neurath may travel to London earlier. Responsible circles in Rome are sympathetic to Chamberlain's desire to resolve the non-interference crisis, but it is heard that the Italian government is particularly unwilling to have other countries take over the patrol areas vacated by German and Italian warships. If Britain and France were to do so, Italy would regard this action as a private policy of Britain and France towards Spain and would not recognize its legal effect. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 25th)

[London] Regarding the Spanish issue, well-informed British sources have recently stated that the government has now firmly decided that Britain will not tolerate any country taking strong and unilateral action in the Mediterranean again. In this regard, well-informed sources in the British naval circles also stated that the navy has taken various technical precautions to deal with all contingencies. In addition, although the Italian press opposes the willingness of Britain and France to perform patrol duties on behalf of Germany and Italy, well-informed British sources believe that this argument may not be consistent with the intentions of the country's Prime Minister Mussolini. Britain and Italy have been in talks since yesterday. (Havas, Central News Agency, 26th)

### Britain and France Agreed to Assume Full Patrol Duties

The Non-Intervention Committee Will Meet at the End of the Month to Decide

[London] At the next meeting of the Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Committee, the British and French governments will declare that they are willing to have British and French warships take over the patrol areas that Germany and Italy have withdrawn from. The British government is also willing to consider in good faith the suggestion that neutral observers be on board the patrol ships. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 26th)

[London] Regarding the situation created after Germany and Italy withdrew from the Spanish sea patrol plan, it is learned from well-informed sources that Foreign Secretary Eden immediately held talks with French Ambassador to Britain Corbin after delivering a speech in the Lower House today. As a result, Britain and France have reached an agreement, advocating that Britain and France should replace Germany and Italy and continue to perform patrol duties on the Spanish sea. Among them, the Spanish Mediterranean coast is the responsibility of the British Navy, and the Atlantic coast is the responsibility of the French Navy. However, this agreement must be approved by the London Coordinating Committee before it can be implemented. It is generally believed that the Coordinating Committee may meet on the 29th of this month, and representatives from Germany and Italy will also attend. After Britain and France reach an agreement, Foreign Secretary Eden will submit the draft agreement to German Charge d'Affaires to Britain Wallman and Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi in the afternoon. After the implementation of this agreement, the Spanish sea will be completely patrolled by Britain and France. The British Navy originally had one battleship, two cruisers, two small fleets, twelve destroyers, and one transport ship. In the future, it will add one destroyer, one mine sweeper, and one small fleet, including several submarines. As for the French warships currently participating in the patrol on the Spanish sea, there were originally two submarines, eight destroyers, four small boats, and five auxiliary ships. In the future, it will also add several warships. (Havas, Central News Agency, 25th)

### Number of Ships from Various Countries off the Spanish Coast

### Many German Technicians Arrive in Bilbao

Italian Staff Headquarters Personnel Measure the Port of Cadiz

⊙Andaye It is learned here that many German technicians arrived in Bilbao today to handle the mines and steel plants recently occupied by the Spanish rebels, and to reorganize telephone and streetcar businesses. The Germans will also assist in the reorganization of the Portugales Naval Shipyard at the mouth of the Nervión River. Mineral products previously accounted for 98% of Basque exports. According to rebel leaders, the iron sand produced there is sufficient for two-thirds of the British military equipment plan. If Britain recognizes the National Government as a belligerent group, then the iron sand can be sold to Britain. (National Telegram, 26th)

[London] The Spanish Embassy recently issued a bulletin stating that a portion of the survey team from the Italian General Staff has moved from Rome to the port of Cadiz in southern Spain. Its head is Lieutenant Colonel De Marchi. There were as many as 15,000 Italian soldiers who landed in the port of Cadiz in mid-May of this year. As of the 24th of this month, another 8,000 had sailed from Civitavecchia, Italy, to Spain. (Havas, Central News Agency, 20th)

### The United States Does Not Interfere in the Spanish Issue

But Pays Close Attention

[Washington] Assistant Secretary of State Welles recently told the press that rumors that the US State Department had instructed its ambassadors to certain European countries to express the US attitude after Germany and Italy withdrew from the patrol plan were untrue. Although the US government is closely monitoring the evolving situation in Spain, it does not intend to intervene. US Ambassador to Germany Dodd's meeting with German Foreign Minister Neurath yesterday was also unrelated to the Spanish issue. (Havas, Central News Agency, 29th)

### British Foreign Secretary's Declaration: No Retreat in the Face of Danger

Britain Concerned About World Peace, Striving to Prevent a Small Spark from Starting a Conflagration

[London] In today's meeting of the House of Commons, Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech, beginning by stating, "Considering the current state of armament of our country and its allies, I absolutely do not believe that we should only continue to retreat or flee, disregarding Britain's vital interests. However, the U.S. government is determined to do everything possible to avoid dragging Britain into the vortex of the Spanish war. This is the responsibility of the Foreign Office and the government, and cannot be shirked. Furthermore, I do not believe that any European country supports the policy of non-intervention in the Spanish civil war more than France." He continued, "Abandoning the policy of non-intervention may not be beneficial to the Spanish Republican government. The United States has already ordered a ban on the export of military supplies to the parties involved in the Spanish civil war. In the current situation, Britain cannot sell a large number of aircraft to the Spanish government either. As for France, it is difficult to determine whether it is prepared to provide the Spanish government with a large amount of military supplies. Moreover, the Spanish National Army is stronger than the government forces in terms of naval power. Even if all countries are willing to supply the government forces with military supplies, a large portion of them would likely be intercepted by the National Army. If both sides involved in the Spanish civil war are recognized as belligerent groups, all countries can sell military supplies to the Spanish government. However, all countries must also protect their ships with their navies so that they have the right to enter Spanish territorial waters. Therefore, abandoning the policy of non-intervention would inevitably lead to significant dangers, which must be considered deeply." Regarding the Central European issue, he said that what we are concerned about is the overall peace of the world. In today's situation, "it is inconceivable that we can ignore events happening anywhere on the globe, and consider the situation in Central Europe as irrelevant."

Next, Eden reiterated the situation created after Germany and Italy withdrew from the Spanish naval surveillance plan, and the British government's position, roughly saying, "It is crucial that we first understand what attitude Germany and Italy hold. On the surface, Germany and Italy will still participate in the non-intervention plan, except for withdrawing from naval surveillance. However, whether these countries can continue to cooperate with the non-intervention measures can only be clarified after the London Adjustment Committee convenes. If Germany and Italy are still willing to continue to cooperate with the Adjustment Committee, it can be said that they are doing their part for the success of the non-intervention policy. As for Britain, it cannot agree with the proposal made by Germany and Italy that after the incident involving the German cruiser "Leipzig," the four countries of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy should begin joint action without waiting for an investigation. The Spanish government not only denies that there was an attack on the "Leipzig," but also claims that all submarines belonging to the government forces were in port when the incident occurred. Therefore, it demands an investigation to prove this. Furthermore, no one witnessed the "Leipzig" being torpedoed by a submarine. Then, is it reasonable for us to jointly execute a judgment before investigating the case? Our refusal to take joint action does not mean that we doubt Germany's sincerity regarding the "Leipzig" incident. However, if a British warship encountered a similar situation, the British government would gladly accept an investigation and would never demand joint action from other countries before an investigation."

Eden continued that submitting the Spanish issue to the League of Nations may not be beneficial because the League of Nations has already twice approved the policies implemented by the London Adjustment Committee. If the Adjustment Committee cannot solve the problem, what good would it do to submit it to the League of Nations? Eden finally said, "I cannot reveal all the details of my consultations with the French government regarding this matter. However, I can tell you that the ultimate goal of the French government in this dispute is exactly the same as ours, which is to do what it can to limit the dangers of the Spanish civil war and prevent it from spreading to other countries in Europe. In short, our intention is to do everything in our power to preserve peace in Europe, but the peace we are talking about is not peace at any cost. This is a sincere statement that I believe you will trust." (Central News Agency, 25th, Havas dispatch)

### Proceedings in the British House of Commons

Opposition Leaders All Deliver Speeches

The House of Commons met today to discuss foreign policy. Sir Archibald Sinclair, leader of the opposition Liberal Party, spoke first, followed by Prime Minister Chamberlain, who delivered his first speech as Prime Minister. He said that although the current situation is serious, it has not yet reached a critical point, and that no European government intends to engage in war. Major Clement Attlee, leader of the opposition Labour Party, then spoke, saying that the policy of non-intervention in the Spanish civil war has completely failed, and as a result, the international situation has not eased and the Spanish civil war has not ended sooner. We now demand that the League of Nations take action. We also advocate restoring all rights to the Spanish government and allowing it to purchase military supplies from other countries. In short, our country should express a firm attitude towards the Spanish issue. In the past, our country has expressed this attitude twice, and each time the situation has improved." David Lloyd George, the former Prime Minister and Liberal Party leader, followed Attlee and said, "If we now tell the world that, regardless of how other countries act, the majority of members of the British House of Commons have no intention of going to war, it would be a major weakness in diplomacy. In the past, regarding easing the situation in Europe and ensuring that Germany received fair treatment, all kinds of difficulties arose from France. Now, I must admit that these difficulties come from Germany." Regarding the Spanish issue, Lloyd George strongly criticized the British government, blaming it for ignoring the Basque autonomous government, and asked whether this hypocritical non-intervention method would continue indefinitely. "The authorities in Germany and Italy have both signed the non-intervention agreement. However, Germany is transporting cannons and ammunition to Spain, and Italy is sending troops to participate in the Spanish civil war. On the other hand, France, whose Prime Minister is a Socialist and expresses sympathy for the Spanish Republican government, could easily provide the government forces with a large amount of military equipment, and the quantity could be much greater than what other countries are transporting. However, France has not done this." Finally, Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a lengthy speech. (Central News Agency, 29th, Havas dispatch)

### Leader of Arctic Expedition Flies Back to Russian Capital

### The Righteous Act of Four Chinese Sailors

Forcibly Sailed a Smuggling Ship to Yantai; Large Quantities of Smuggled Goods Seized by Customs; One Japanese Warship Arrived in Yantai to Demonstrate

Jinan Correspondence: The Japanese ship "Tohei Maru" has been transporting smuggled goods between Dalian and Qinhuangdao for more than a year, transferring the smuggled goods to Tianjin and selling them inland. The amount of smuggled goods transported has reached a staggering figure. On the 21st of this month, the ship again sailed from Dalian fully loaded with smuggled goods worth more than 200,000 yuan, hoping to sail to Qinhuangdao and transfer them for sale inland. There were four Chinese sailors on the ship. After witnessing the ship's smuggling for more than a year, they were filled with righteous indignation. When the ship sailed to Chinese territorial waters near Qinhuangdao, they seized the opportunity to restrain a certain person escorting the smuggled goods and temporarily changed the ship's course to Yantai. On the 22nd, it arrived in Yantai. The Yantai Customs then confiscated all the smuggled goods and sent the Japanese on board to the local Japanese Consulate. One of the four Chinese sailors was spotted on the street by the Japanese Consulate. The Yantai Administrative Commissioner Zhang Kuiwen was contacted by the Japanese to demand the return of this Chinese sailor. The Japanese also sent a Japanese warship from Dalian on the 23rd to the waters off Yantai. Yantai Administrative Commissioner Zhang Kuiwen reported the seizure of smuggled goods and the arrival of the Japanese warship in Yantai to the Shandong Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuju by telegram. After receiving the report, Han immediately telegraphed the Administrative Commissioner and the local garrison to pay close attention and immediately send the Chinese sailor to Jinan for questioning, under no circumstances should they hand him over to the Japanese Consulate. At the same time, he telegraphed a report to the Nanjing Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (24th)

### Discovery of a Certain Country's Warship off Nan'ao Island

Transporting Six Wooden Crates, Clearly Seeking to Reconnoiter

Shantou Correspondence: According to a report from Nan'ao County, just as dawn broke on the morning of the 16th, a black and gray warship of a certain country was suddenly discovered within half a mile of Nan'ao. The warship's hull was only about two feet above the water, narrow and long, with two large cannons at the bow and stern, and eight ordinary cannons. Wireless antennas were all over the masts. A local fisherman, Ji Xi, immediately rowed a boat to watch the warship. He saw that there was no national flag or name or number on the stern. At that time, three people from a certain country on the deck were setting up telescopes and observing the Yungaishi Temple. One person held a camera and took pictures in all directions. After about half an hour, a sailboat sailed from the Dongshan area and approached the warship. More than ten people walked out of the warship, jumped onto the sailboat, and lifted six wooden crates, five people per crate, onto the deck. There were also more than ten baskets of eggs. The sailboat then sped towards the Fujian border. After 7:00, the warship also left. From the actions of the warship's appearance and disappearance, one can imagine the crisis facing Nan'ao today.

### Chahar North People's Self-Defense Army Occupies Heihechuan as a Base

Li Ying's Troops Are Advancing Towards Heihechuan; Guo Ziying's Troops Are Approaching Shangdu County Seat; Bandit-Puppet Troops Are Now Reorganized into Eight Divisions

Zhangbei Correspondence: The Chahar North People's Self-Defense Army, considering the Heihechuan area to have dangerous terrain, being conveniently located between Rehe and Chahar for entry and exit, has now occupied it as a base. Along the Guyuan-Jingpeng Avenue, they are using guerrilla tactics to confront the bandits and puppets. Many of the people attached to the righteousness in that area are also preparing in secret, waiting for an opportunity to launch a major offensive. Li Ying's troops, who were confronting the Rehe puppet security team, were difficult to sustain due to a lack of reinforcements. On the 22nd, they led their troops from the Guyuan-Jingpeng Avenue, fighting and retreating, to Heihechuan. They arrived on the 23rd. After a brief respite, they will continue to fight. The Heihechuan area is located on the border between Rehe and Chahar, surrounded by more than 400 li, with undulating hills and complex roads, making it extremely convenient for military operations. In addition to Ji Ying's troops of about 1,000 people, there are also other civilian troops of about 4,000 people, all concentrated waiting for an opportunity to revolt. At about 2 p.m. on the 19th of this month, a plane from a certain country went to Heihechuan to scout the activities of the civilian army. It was spotted by the civilian army, who gathered to shoot at it. The plane was severely damaged and barely flew to Laobakou, where it crashed. The nationality of the pilot was killed by the civilian army. To this day, the bandits and puppets still regard that area as a major threat.

According to a recent arrival from Shangdu, Guo Ziying's troops of the civilian army, numbering about 400, stationed in the Tianchengliang area, have long been planning to seize Shangdu. However, Yin Binshan, the puppet army's second division commander, has been very vigilant, and there has been no opportunity to take advantage of this. On the 21st of this month, there were those within the puppet army who responded to the civilian army and wanted to provide internal assistance. Guo Ziying immediately led his troops to approach Shangdu under the cover of darkness. More than 100 puppet troops (a company or more) stationed outside the city responded to the civilian army. At the same time, those in the city also planned to respond and launch an attack. Gunfire erupted everywhere, not ceasing all night. However, Yin Baoshan was quite calm. Amidst the turmoil, he ordered all four gates to be tightly closed, holding firm and unmoved, so that there was no communication between the inside and outside, and Shangdu could not be captured. Guo then led his troops back to Tianchengliang. Yin Baoshan then closed the city and conducted a major search for one day on the 22nd, cutting off traffic until noon on the 23rd, when he opened the city gates and allowed people to enter and exit. It is estimated that a large number of people were arrested and detained in this battle.

As for the current situation of the bandit-puppet troops in Chahar North, there has not been a major troop movement. Only one regiment of the puppet sixth division stationed in Gonghui was sent to Zhangbei to increase defenses. However, because a certain country reduced their subsidies, the bandit-puppet troops have been reorganized. The Hu Baoshan Brigade stationed in Kangbao has also been divided into various units to supplement vacancies. They are now organized into the following eight divisions: puppet 1st Division (Liu Jiguang), puppet 2nd Division (Yin Baoshan), puppet 3rd Division (Wang Zhenhua), puppet 4th Division (Bao Zichen), puppet 5th Division (Yi Xiaoxian), puppet 6th Division (Zhuo Laiyoutu), puppet 7th Division (Muke Dengbao), and puppet 8th Division (Bao Yueqing). Each division has three cavalry regiments and one machine gun company, totaling about 1,100 people, with a combined total of less than 10,000. As for their defense assignments, Liu Jiguang is stationed in Shangyi, Yin Baoshan is stationed in Shangdu, Wang Zhenhua is stationed in Chaoyangzhen, Bao Zichen is stationed in Zhangbei, Yi Xiaoxian is stationed in Baochang, Muke Dengbao is stationed in Kangbao, Zhuo Laiyoutu is stationed in Gonghui, and Bao Yueqing is stationed in Duolun. All are tightly guarding their defense areas, intensifying training, and rushing to build defensive fortifications. (23rd)

County Magistrate Corruption Case Sentenced

Zhang Shude, the former Tangxi County Magistrate, was found to have fraudulently reported six months of salary for his secretary, Sun Dan Chen, who resigned only ten days after taking office, with Zhang holding both positions, totaling 600 yuan. Other section chiefs and personnel were also involved in corruption. The provincial government dismissed Zhang, section chief Qian Shuxiang, accountant Chen Ruiheng, clerks Huang Xingjia, Luan Zhiyi, and Shi Wengang, and handed them over to the court for interrogation.

Security Police to Be Completed by the End of the Month

The fifteen security brigades directly under the jurisdiction of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Office, stationed in various counties, were originally formed from the local cadre teams and were actually the local self-defense forces of each county. The provincial government decided to uniformly reorganize them into security police teams, still directly commanded by the county magistrates. Since the reorganization began last month, more than sixty counties and cities, including Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Yin County, have completed the reorganization. Only a dozen counties on the eastern border of Zhejiang, such as Kaihua, Ruian, and Pingyang, have not yet completed the reorganization because there are still scattered bandits being cleared. The provincial government has not yet received reports from them. The reorganization may be completed as scheduled by the end of this month. The Security Office will send personnel to various counties to inspect and give instructions.

### Kunshan

Provincial Personnel Sent to Investigate the Opium Case

At the end of last month, when Gu Yin'an was checking opium addicts after rehabilitation at the First District Office, he suspected that they had relapsed. He sent them to the county hospital for testing. The results showed that they were addicted to poison, and there were bribery incidents during the hospital testing. The case was sent back to the county government for review and was detained pending judgment after questioning. Later, Gu filed a report with the provincial government, the Provincial Opium Prohibition Committee, and the Second District Commissioner's Office, requesting a thorough investigation on the grounds that the county hospital's handling of the matter was sloppy and the diagnosis was reckless. It is reported that Li Weichun was sent by the provincial government and the Provincial Opium Prohibition Committee to Kunshan on the 25th to conduct a thorough investigation. It is said that Li has already gained some insight into the case and returned to the province on the morning of the 26th to report.

East-West Main Road to Be Constructed

The north-south main road here will be fully completed by the end of July. The county authorities will soon begin the construction of the east-west main road, starting from the Zongguan Temple outside the East Gate and ending at the West Gate entrance. The surveying work has been completed. Because the entire route passes through busy streets, the construction period will be shortened as much as possible. It is planned to start construction on September 1st and complete it all by the end of January. The estimated cost of labor and materials is 40,000 yuan, half of which will be drawn from the provincial construction funds and half from county funds.

### Taixian

Grain Market Prices Soar

The wheat harvest in the counties of Jiangbei Taidong this year is quite abundant. Since the start of the trade, the price of wheat has gradually increased. Especially in recent days, the wheat market has seen a sharp rise. The reason is that the flour mills in the Wuxi and Shanghai areas are competing to buy goods. When it was launched on the market, wheat from this county (Jiang City, 180 pounds) was only priced at 7.8 yuan, but recently it has reached 10 yuan, which is a rare increase in recent years. Barley and Yuanmai have also risen sharply due to strong purchases. Barley has increased by 8 or 9 jiao compared to the previous price, and Yuanmai has increased by more than 1 yuan. In addition, rice, beans, soybeans, etc., have also increased by several jiao due to the pressure on the wheat market. In general, profiteering merchants are taking advantage of this to hoard and speculate. It seems unlikely that the market will fall in the short term.

### Nantong

Water Police Team Searches for Scattered Bandits

Bengbu City has decided to establish a wheat inspection station. It is reported that Fang and Liu Guangcheng, the director of the Fengyang Wheat Crop Improvement Field, have arrived in Bengbu one after another to discuss the progress with Jin Jichen, the president of the local bank. It is said that the station is scheduled to be established on July 1st.

### Fuzhou

Restoration of Qi Jiguang's Tomb

Qi Jiguang, a wise man of the Ming Dynasty, was stationed in the Fujian territory. He used the current Gulou Higher Court as his headquarters. In the back garden of the court, there remains the tomb of Qi Gong's garments and hats. The broken steles and fragments are all relics of the Ming Dynasty. It is now known that Tong Hangshi, the president of the court, intends to restore the tomb to showcase the merits of this wise man and promote the national spirit. The tomb has now been completely renovated, and a Qi Jiguang Memorial Hall is being built in the garden. Historical relics related to Qi Gong's life are being collected and displayed. At the same time, to inspire future generations to resist aggression and defend the country, it is stipulated that it will be open to the public for visits on Sundays, so that visitors to this garden will suddenly be inspired with the desire to bravely resist foreign aggression.

Travel Correspondence

### A Visit to Long Yun

— Geng Ya

From Chengdu to Kunming, it takes more than thirty days by land, but only three and a half hours by plane. I decided to travel by plane. As the plane soared out of the morning mist of Chengdu, flying towards Kunming, I saw the Emei snow in spring, resembling a white-haired old man, extremely crystal clear and dazzling. The snow also rendered the high peaks, shoulder to shoulder with Emei, into a silver world. Then, we flew over a long stretch of empty space and crossed many steep ridges and snow-capped mountains. The ancient city towers of Kunming, the Huashan Twin Pagodas, were already in sight. The plane landed at Wujiaba Airport. From the airport to the city, there was still a stretch of road of eight or nine kilometers to travel. Passing through Gucheng Park and entering Zhuangyuan Building, heading west, one finds wide and straight streets. The old Dongyue Temple on the north side of the road has been destroyed and converted into a People's Livelihood Factory. The City God Temple in the Quanye Market has also had its clay sculptures torn down, and the temple halls have been converted into a public cinema. The roads are all paved with smooth and even stone slabs. Passing Desheng Bridge to Jinma Avenue, and turning north into Sanshi Street, then entering the Dananmen Gate, passing Sanpaifang, and reaching Mashi Kou, for about three or four li, is the bustling commercial district of Kunming City.

The cityscapes of Jinma Avenue and Sanshi Street feature Western-style buildings with terrazzo facades. Rows of locust trees are planted on the sidewalks on both sides. The tall and exquisite Jinma Archway and Biji Archway are comparable to the Four Archways of the former capital. The Jinri Building of the Dananmen Gate, towering high in the sky, is also very similar to the Qianmen Jinri Building of the former capital. There is also a small park surrounded by city roads in front of the Jinri Building, called Jinri Park. Nearby is the flower market, fragrant with flowers. Walking into the Jinri Building, the facades present a different scene, purely Chinese-style buildings with two stories. The rafters and beams are carved with dragons and phoenixes and painted with green lacquer, fully inlaid with glass windows. The doors and windows of the facades on the ground floor are vermilion in matching tones, full of ancient charm. It is a pity that the buildings share beams and columns, and carelessness in one house can affect the others.

The first inconvenience that outsiders feel when they arrive here is the complex currency system. Simply eating some refreshments can cost three or five yuan, and hiring a rickshaw for a day cannot be done for less than ten yuan. The reason is that the paper currency commonly used in Yunnan Province was based on the old currency of the Fudian Bank before the establishment of the Yunnan New Bank. After the new bank was established, it was ordered to use the new currency as the standard. The central government announced the legal tender policy, and it should have used the legal tender as the standard. However, due to the historically low cost of living, the people calculated prices in old currency, which was difficult to change. Therefore, both new and old Yunnan currencies are still in popular use. However, the currency values also have a certain standard. One yuan of the old Fudian Bank note can be exchanged for one jiao of the Central Bank's subsidiary currency, or worth a jiao of the new currency of the Fudian New Bank. In other words, one jiao of the Central Bank note is equivalent to two jiao of the new note, or one yuan of the old note. Therefore, the "yuan" commonly referred to in the market, such as eating refreshments costing three or five yuan, is only three or five jiao of the Central Bank note.

Long Yun, the Pacification Commissioner of Yunnan and Guizhou and Chairman of Yunnan Province, graduated from the Yunnan Military Academy and has held military and political power in Yunnan Province since 1928 to this day. According to popular rumor, the reason he has been able to do so is that he does not easily let go of anything, no matter how big or small. For example, the logistics bureau needs to make dry food bags and kettles, and he must be consulted for his consent on whether the style is suitable. Temporary expenses of the Pacification Headquarters and the Provincial Government, generally exceeding 100 Yunnan dollars (10 national currency dollars), must be made known to him. The Pacification Headquarters appointing a platoon leader, and the Provincial Government appointing a county magistrate, after all the procedures are completed, must ultimately be decided by his opinion. One example can illustrate the rest.

In Kunming City, there are two small mountains. One is called Yuantong Mountain, located in the northeast, which has now been transformed into Yuantong Park, with beautiful scenery. The other is called Wuhua Mountain, located in the central part, where the Provincial Government is located, with an even more secluded and beautiful landscape. Wuhua Mountain has towering ancient cypresses, and the strong electric light emitted by the "Guangfu Building" at night can be clearly seen from dozens of miles away. As for climbing up to look out, the city views and Cuihu Lake in the near distance, and West Mountain and Dianchi Lake in the far distance, are all listed in full view. When Wu Sangui raised troops in Yunnan, he built palaces on it, but the current "Kaiwu Pavilion," "Guangfu Building," and "Office Building" are all new-style buildings after the founding of the Republic of China. Due to the limited area, only the Pacification Headquarters is attached to it. The Civil Affairs Building, the Education Building, and other departments have not yet been able to work together in the same building. Public officials of the Pacification Headquarters or the Provincial Government generally refer to "going to work" as "going up Wuhua Mountain." I also went up Wuhua Mountain, for the purpose of visiting Mr. Long. Mr. Long was energetic and alert in his speech. The scope of the conversation was very broad. Here are some excerpts from my notes. He believes that the central government's foreign policy is very steady and well-managed. The ancients said, "Preparedness ensures success in everything." Foreign relations are a major issue. Everything must be prepared with certainty, including strengthening military force, stockpiling food, facilitating transportation, and training and organizing the people. Then the effect of launching will be great. It takes all one's strength to fight a tiger, and it takes all one's strength to catch a rabbit. Whether partial or total, the launch should be done with the full force of national unity, and it must be sustained, like boiling thick congee, until it is better than the enemy. Only then will there be a reasonable hope for revitalizing the nation and recovering lost territory. Regarding the training of the people, simply gathering for training for a month or two, and not teaching marksmanship, will inevitably have little practical effect in terms of use. However, if training continues for several months, it is feared that it will interfere with farming time. Therefore, according to the conscription law, able-bodied men should be drafted, and permanent teams should be organized. When farmers are busy, they should be engaged in farming. When farmers are free, they should be gathered for training. After three or four years, this can be equivalent to a real combat soldier. If diplomatic problems arise between Yunnan and Annam and Burma, major matters should be reported to the central government, and minor matters should be resolved locally. The debts owed to foreigners by the former government, amounting to 7 or 8 million Yunnan dollars, have long been paid off. The Yunnan dollars received by the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway used to be redeemable at the Provincial Government, but this practice has now been tacitly abolished. The regular army of Yunnan has now been reduced to 20 regiments, totaling about 25,000 men, and a conscription system is adopted, implementing the principle of elite troops. Therefore, the communist army was able to achieve victories with fewer troops against more troops in its two intrusions into Yunnan. In addition, each county has permanent teams, which are responsible for maintaining local security. The opium prohibition issue has been implemented in accordance with the central government's regulations. In the past, when opium was not prohibited, the opium tax collected in the province accounted for nearly one-half of the fiscal revenue. Now, the prohibition has been resolutely implemented, and at the same time, the planting of cotton, tung oil trees, and lacquer trees is being promoted, along with the establishment of spinning and weaving factories, to offset the income from opium land and recover profits that have been flowing out.

### The State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jinjiang Steamer Launched Yesterday

Miss Cai Kunyi Threw the Bottle, Hundreds of Guests Attended / Completion in Three Months to Restore Shanghai-Chongqing Route / Continued Construction of Five River Steamers, Investment by Jin Cheng Bank

The State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in order to restore the Chongqing River route, commissioned the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Ministry of the Navy to build the external hull of the Jinjiang steamer, which has been assembled and painted. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the launching ceremony was held at the shipyard. Hundreds of Chinese and foreign guests attended. Miss Cai Kunyi performed the bottle-throwing ceremony. Lu Hanqin, Director of the Maritime Administration Department of the Ministry of Transportation, attended as a special representative. The event was quite grand. The details are as follows:

Venue Arrangement

The ceremony venue was set up at the shipyard of the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Ministry of the Navy on Gaochangmiao Manufacturing Bureau Road. A ceremonial platform was erected in front of the dock where the Jinjiang steamer was placed, with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen and the national flag suspended in the middle. Two bottles of fresh flowers and a censer were placed on the table. The bow of the Jinjiang steamer faced inward, with a bottle of champagne tied with a silk ribbon for the bottle-throwing ceremony. The hull of the ship was freshly painted, and the ship was fully decorated with national flags, making it beautiful and solemn. A sound system was installed on the platform to broadcast the details of the ceremony and the speeches. Champagne and refreshments were prepared to entertain the guests.

Attending Guests

Yesterday, the attendance at the ceremony was very enthusiastic. The attendees included Lu Hanqin, Director of the Maritime Administration Department of the Ministry of Transportation; Cai Zengji, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company; Ma Deji, Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Ministry of the Navy; Chen Zaofan, Deputy Director; Zeng Yijing, Director of the Aircraft Manufacturing Department of the Ministry of the Navy; Mao Gen, Chief Engineer; Weng Zuxian, Chief of Staff of the Ministry of the Navy; Ye Baoqi, Battalion Commander of the Guard; Wu Yunzhai of Jin Cheng Bank; Ben Men Tuo, U.S. Naval Attaché; Shi Gutuo, British Commercial Counselor; Principal Li of the Merchant Marine School; and hundreds of male and female guests, including taipans and managers from Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Sanbei, Ning Shao, and other shipping companies, who were warmly received by Section Chiefs and Secretaries of the Jiangnan Shipyard, including Yu Jianfu, Liang Xunying, Weng Ruiwu, and Meng Xiutang.

Bottle-Throwing and Launching

At 2:00 PM sharp, the ceremony began. After the ritual, the bottle-throwing ceremony was held. Cai Kunyi, the daughter of Cai Zengji, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, held the champagne bottle in her right hand and threw it forcefully at the bow of the ship amid the sound of music. With a loud bang, the champagne splashed everywhere, and the Jinjiang steamer slowly sailed into the Huangpu River amid the sound of firecrackers and applause from the guests. After about one or two minutes, the ship safely docked in the middle of the river. The guests raised champagne and congratulated Director Ma and General Manager Cai. The atmosphere was quite enthusiastic. Subsequently, Director Ma, Director Lu, and General Manager Cai delivered speeches one after another and took a group photo before dispersing. The Jiangnan Shipyard also prepared an ivory-carved ding tripod and presented it to Miss Cai as a souvenir.

Director Ma's Speech

In his speech, Chairman Ma said, "Although the Jiangnan Shipyard is a naval agency, its purpose is not limited to the naval aspect, but it is also happy to assist in the development of the shipping industry in order to achieve the goal of recovering shipping rights. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is working hard to develop shipping. In addition to the Jinjiang steamer, there are also two 164-foot-long fast steamers that can travel upstream, which will be launched in three months. There are also three cargo ships that can carry 1,000 tons of cargo, which can also be launched in six months. The Jiangnan Shipyard and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are both government agencies and cooperate with each other technically and spiritually to seek common development. Watching the launching of a ship is like going to Haining to watch the tide. If the tide is not big this year, we all hope that there will be a big tide next year. Therefore, I hope that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will build a 10,000-ton ocean liner in the future, and the launching ceremony at that time will be even more lively. I believe that this hope will definitely become a reality."

Director Lu's Speech

In his speech, Lu Hanqin, Director of the Maritime Administration Department of the Ministry of Transportation, said, "The attendance of today's guests is so enthusiastic that it shows their excitement about the shipbuilding industry. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, directly under the Ministry of Transportation, has only been around for four or five years. In addition to the ships built before, four ships have been built since it became state-run. However, because they were built with the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity funds, they were all built in the United Kingdom. The Jinjiang steamer is the first ship built domestically. Building ships is a predetermined plan, and the initial start will be from the upstream and downstream starting points of the Yangtze River, and then gradually build coastal and ocean-going ships. The Jiangnan Shipyard is China's shipbuilding agency. After this expansion, it will be able to build large ships of 500 to 600 feet and 10,000 tons in the future."

General Manager Cai's Speech

In his speech, Cai Zengji, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, said, "The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been serving society for 60 years. It opened the upstream Chongqing River route four years ago. Now, in order to restore the route, in addition to building the Jinjiang steamer, there are also two fast steamers that will begin construction. At the same time, it is planned to build three cargo ships to operate in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and contracts have been signed. The construction of these six ships is the result of the cooperation of the Jiangnan Shipyard, the banking industry, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The three ships in the upper reaches are invested by Jin Cheng Bank, and the three ships in the middle reaches are invested by the Bank of Communications. This is a new era for the banking industry to invest in the shipping industry. The Yangtze River area has a dense population, and its economic situation is that interest rates are often around 1.4 or 1.5 percent. After transportation becomes convenient in the future, the economic situation will gradually improve. In order to increase its ability to serve society, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will be able to transport as much transshipment cargo as possible after adding six ships to operate on the Yangtze River. Sichuan Province has always been known as the 'Land of Abundance.' After the completion of railway construction in the province, the situation will be completely new. The launching of the Jinjiang steamer is a good phenomenon of the concerted efforts of the industrial, banking, and shipping industries, and the future is worthy of celebration."

Construction Overview

The Jinjiang steamer was reconstructed from the Emei. Except for the original machinery and boilers, which were retained due to their excellent quality, the rest were all new materials. Therefore, although it is a reconstruction, it is actually no different from a new construction. The cost is more than 700,000 yuan. If the recent soaring material prices are estimated, it would cost 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. The overall length of the ship is 221 feet and 9 inches, the net length is 210 feet, the width is 33 feet, the depth is 11 feet and 6 inches, the heavy load draft is 9 feet, the maximum speed is 13 and a half nautical miles, the cargo capacity is 600 tons, and the passenger capacity is 240 people, including 12 first-class passengers, 52 second-class passengers, and 176 third-class passengers. Special heat-insulating bricks are used below the sampan deck. It is also equipped with long and short wave wireless, cold storage, with a total of five or six hundred cubic feet, bathrooms with hot and cold water pipes, etc., all with the latest equipment. The oil tank is wide and can transport 200 tons of tung oil. The cargo hold is especially long and can transport railway materials. The cargo lifting machines are 10 tons and 15 tons each. A double bottom is added to the front cargo hold. It is expected to be completed in three months, and then handed over to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to restore the Chongqing River route.

The Maritime Bureau Ordered All Captains to Be Suspended / The Shipping Bureau Negotiated for Temporary One-Time Navigation

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinjiang-Tianning steamer collided with the Sanbei Shipping Company's Ningxing steamer at the mouth of Zhenhai. The owners of the two ships returned to Shanghai on Thursday. Regarding the issue of responsibility, they pushed the blame on each other. The captain of the Xinjiang-Tianning steamer said that it was the Ningxing that crashed into it. The captain of the Ningxing reported to the Maritime Administration Bureau that it was the Xinjiang-Tianning that crashed into it, and said that the Xinjiang-Tianning steamer had been speeding more than once. The Ningxing shipowner warned the Xinjiang-Tianning six times, and said that he had reported it to the Zhenhai Customs. Yesterday, the two ships returned to Shanghai from Ningbo. After entering the port, the Maritime Administration Bureau issued an order to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Sanbei Shipping Company, saying, "After investigation, the Xinjiang-Tianning and Ningxing steamers collided at the mouth of Zhenhai. The captains are really derelict in their duties and should be suspended at the same time to await summons." At the same time, clearance of the two ships was prohibited. If it is necessary to sail, another captain must be sent. After receiving this order, the authorities of the two companies went to the Maritime Administration Bureau to negotiate. The Sanbei Company said that the disaster of the collision was due to the Xinjiang-Tianning, and the Ningxing should sail as usual. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company said that since the Ningxing can export, the Xinjiang-Tianning, as a formal scheduled ship, cannot be delayed or delayed. As a result of the negotiation, the Maritime Administration Bureau temporarily allowed the two ships to sail once more, and after the next shift to Shanghai, they will conduct inquiries into the responsibility of the two captains for the accident to determine the punishment. The captains of the offending ships will be suspended, and passengers on the Ningxing steamer have sent letters to the Sanbei Company, willing to be eyewitnesses to the collision.

It is also understood that the fundraising campaign ended last night. The details are recorded as follows:

Fundraising Situation

On the previous two days, over a thousand Boy Scouts each day, from morning till dusk, received donation books from the temporary office of the Renji Hall Board of Directors and went out to solicit donations from tea shops, restaurants, dance halls, theaters, companies, shops, and on the sidewalks and trams. There was no place where they were not seen. Yesterday, inside Renji Hall, those receiving donation books and submitting donations came in an endless stream. The Boy Scouts' enthusiasm was commendable, and the citizens generously donated, resulting in excellent fundraising results.

Glimpse of the Results

The Shishi Elementary School contributed 167 yuan, Huai'an Elementary School over 150 yuan, Huiqun Girls' School over 100 yuan, Franco-Chinese School over 100 yuan, and Lisheng Elementary School 67 yuan.

He Dequi's Special Donation

Therefore, the Boy Scouts' hard work is truly admirable. He Dequi, the newly appointed Deputy General Manager of the Municipal Council, believed that the Boy Scouts' enthusiastic solicitation in the rain was commendable. In addition to a special donation of one hundred yuan as part of the Boy Scouts' fundraising achievements, he also donated 20 yuan in national currency and sent a letter instructing the charity organization disaster relief association to purchase prizes to be awarded to those Boy Scouts who went out in the rain to solicit donations and achieved the best results, in order to encourage them.

### Speculative Manipulation Confirmed in Yarn Exchange Turmoil; Central Representatives and Municipal Government Investigated and Suspended Accounts Yesterday

Da Feng and Other Firms Deemed Related to the Turmoil; Supervisory Yuan Representative Zhang Youlun Discusses Investigation Process

The turmoil in the Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange market, after investigation by the Yuan and departments, and the suspension of all brokers' account books, transaction records, and other documents, continued yesterday. It was discovered that over ten brokerage firms, including Da Feng, were indeed related to the turmoil. Therefore, yesterday, in conjunction with the Shanghai Municipal Government Public Security Bureau, they went to each of these firms to suspend all their accounts. The details are recorded as follows:

Suspension of Accounts of Da Feng and Other Firms

The Executive Yuan paid close attention to the yarn exchange turmoil. In addition to sending personnel to Shanghai to investigate, it also ordered the Shanghai Municipal Government to conduct a secret investigation. After several days of detailed investigation, it was discovered that there were indeed instances of speculative manipulation. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, Zhao Shenyu, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Industry, Liang Fuzheng, and others, went to the Municipal Government. The Municipal Government dispatched a special investigator from the Social Affairs Bureau and four plainclothes police officers to investigate the accounts of over ten yarn firms, including Da Feng (Broker No. 17 in the Yarn Exchange) and Fukang (Broker No. 62 in the Yarn Exchange). First, the police showed official documents, and then the special investigators examined the accounts. After four hours, as a detailed investigation was deemed necessary, each firm was ordered to hand over all account books, records, letters, etc., to be brought to the Municipal Government for review. This yarn exchange turmoil will soon come to light.

Account Review Nearing Completion

As for the accounts of other brokers from May 1st to June 8th, previously suspended by the Ministry of Industry and temporarily stored in the Yarn Exchange Board of Directors' office for investigation, the work has not been completed in the past four days. Now, that portion of the accounts has been reviewed. Therefore, starting yesterday, the account review personnel from the Ministry of Industry no longer went to the Yarn Exchange to investigate. However, the account books have not yet been returned. If any questions arise, they will be revisited at any time. Supervisors Yan Zhuang and Zhang Youlun, and others, were dispatched to Shanghai to assist in the investigation. They paid close attention to the matter and have been gathering related parties in Shanghai to conduct research, in order to quickly investigate and handle the matter.

Supervisory Yuan Representative Zhang Youlun Discusses

Supervisory Yuan Counselor Zhang Youlun said that the central government attaches great importance to the turmoil in the yarn exchange market. After a detailed secret investigation, it has been determined that several firms are indeed engaging in speculative manipulation and will be reported to the competent authorities for handling. However, the brewing of the yarn exchange turmoil has been going on for quite some time. If it could have been prevented earlier, such a major disturbance might not have occurred. At the same time, in order to prevent future speculative manipulation of the market and the impact on social economy, based on the near and distant causes obtained from this investigation, a concise memorandum will be submitted to the central government, requesting adoption and implementation in order to stabilize people's livelihood and ensure social stability.

### Sir Robert Ho Tung Expresses His Feelings on the Disaster Situation in Sichuan and Guizhou

Donated a Total of 60,000 Yuan for Disaster Relief

Sir Robert Ho Tung is currently visiting the capital and plans to travel to various parts of the country. Sir Robert has always been charitable. Recently, seeing reports of the serious disaster situation in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces, with deaths reported everywhere, he based on his compassionate spirit and, in addition to the 10,000 yuan he donated in Beijing last time, yesterday donated another 50,000 yuan for disaster relief (40,000 yuan for Sichuan and 10,000 yuan for Guizhou). Zhang Qun, chairman of the Shanghai All Circles Sichuan Disaster Relief Association, and vice-chairmen Wu Dingchang, Xu Kan, Yu Hongjun, and Du Yuesheng, will hold a tea party at the International Hotel at 4:30 PM on the 28th to entertain Sir Robert Ho Tung. A Central News Agency reporter visited Sir Robert yesterday and recorded his personal thoughts on the disaster situation in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces. He said that the disaster situation in various provinces has been spreading for a long time, and the victims are digging up grass roots and tree bark to fill their stomachs, yet they cannot get a full meal all day. Recently, due to the hot weather and the prevalence of epidemics, the dying victims are dying in droves. If we do not gather the strength of the national government and people to quickly raise funds for disaster relief and find ways to properly handle the aftermath, it would be extremely regrettable both from the perspective of the country and from the perspective of human morality. Otherwise, certain provinces or regions would be rich and prosperous like heaven on earth, while certain provinces or regions would be allowed to be ravaged by disasters and death. This would not only hinder the balanced development of the country but also be a pity from the perspective of humanitarianism, as it would not be possible to sympathize with the weak. Last month, when I visited Beijing, I received news of the famine in various provinces and immediately donated 10,000 yuan. After returning to Shanghai, I continued to hear about the severity of the disaster, so I decided to donate another 50,000 yuan, not daring to be a leader for all parties, but only to do my best.

### Red Swastika Society Handles Drought Disaster in Sichuan, Gansu, and Guizhou

The Red Swastika Society, for the disaster areas in Henan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and other provinces, has already jointly raised more than 100,000 yuan with various associations and allocated them to Henan, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, and Guizhou provinces to handle emergency relief. It is now reported that the Shanghai General Office of the Society has raised more than 10,000 yuan and allocated it to the Wanxian Swastika Society in Sichuan, with President Ma Weizan handling the emergency relief. Yesterday, the office received a telegram from the Wanxian Swastika Society in Sichuan, reporting that the disaster relief funds had been remitted by the Farmers Bank and that a large disaster relief team had been organized, led by Captain Wang Yongcheng, to set off for the disaster area for relief. The office also allocated a large quantity of epidemic prevention medicines and sent them to Sichuan for relief. According to Li Tianzhen, the Sichuan disaster investigation commissioner of the society, who returned to Shanghai to report, the disaster situation in Sichuan is serious, with starving corpses being transported in all disaster areas of various counties. Many victims are digging up corpses to fill their stomachs, and there are no caregivers for the disaster-stricken children. The tragic situation brings tears to stone statues. It is hoped that kind-hearted people from all walks of life will provide assistance quickly.

The disaster area in Gansu Province is no less severe than that in Sichuan. The Red Swastika Society has already allocated 2,000 yuan for disaster relief, but the disaster area is vast and the number of victims is large, which is not enough to help. The disaster-stricken children in various counties are in groups of hundreds, with no clothes to cover their bodies and no food to fill their stomachs, which is particularly pitiful. Last month, Zhu Ziqiao, the chairman of the Disaster Relief Committee, returned to Shanghai after surveying the disaster situation in various provinces and proposed to set up disaster relief homes for children in various counties in Gansu Province. Each home costs 2,000 yuan and can support 100 children. The average cost of eating porridge per child per month is only 2 yuan. Xiong Xiling and Zhao Daozi, the two presidents of the Red Swastika Society, first took on the expenses of one home each and immediately started to run them in Gansu Province in order to promote them.

The General Office of the Swastika Society also continued to receive a telegram from Luo Gonghua, the director of the Gansu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, and a reply telegram from Xue Yue, the chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Government. They are recorded as follows: To Presidents Xiong Bing-san, Zhou Chongguang, Han Fuhang, Zhao Daozi, Li Daowu, and others of the Shanghai Red Swastika Society: Gansu Province has a total of 67 counties with more than 6 million people, and 58 counties with more than 3 million people have been affected by the disaster. This year, the central government has allocated more than 600,000 yuan to provide one yuan per person according to regulations, but more than 2 million people are still excluded. Spring plowing is impossible, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. Please raise funds to remit to Lanzhou or send personnel for emergency relief. Luo Gonghua, Ma Min, prostrate.

Guizhou Telegram (title omitted): In view of the severe drought in our province this spring, funds are scarce. Thank you for allocating 1,000 yuan to be handed over to Director Cheng Chensheng for investigation and distribution for disaster relief. The victims have benefited greatly. Special telegram in reply with thanks. Xue Yue, Chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Disaster Relief Committee, respectfully.

Please Stop the Arrest of Workers by the Police and Negotiate with the Factory for Immediate Resumption of Work

The Shanghai Brewery factory in western Shanghai, owned by British merchants, went on strike on the 21st due to unsuccessful demands for wage increases and the reinstatement of dismissed workers. Five days have passed, and the issue remains unresolved. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, all 135 workers, divided among several trucks, went to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to stage a large-scale petition. While passing the Second Branch of the Seventh District, the branch, fearing incidents, dispatched Mr. Zhang Baohua and Mr. Li Ming, leading dozens of police officers to dissuade them. Aside from leaving a large contingent at the branch, fifty workers proceeded directly to the Social Affairs Bureau. Upon arrival, they sent forward five representatives, Zhao Jinyuan, Zhang Hongsheng, Sha Xunxing, Xu Xueqin, and Liu Yuting, to request an audience. The bureau sent Mr. Zhang Chuqiang to receive them. The worker representatives put forward two requests: ⑴ The Gordon Road police station has arrested more than ten workers, using torture in the station, causing injuries, demanding negotiations with the police station and compensation for medical expenses; ⑵ Requesting the factory to resume work immediately.

### ### Jiu Fu Company Manager Zhu Ruifu Accused of Enticing a Dancer

The Defendant Also Retained a Lawyer to File a Counter-Suit; The Court Ordered the Conclusion of Arguments and Scheduled Sentencing

Zhu Ruifu, the manager of the Jiu Fu Company in this city, a native of Anhui, over thirty years old, is known for his extravagance and frequently seen in theaters and dance halls. Recently, he was sued in the local court by Chen Musen, also from Anhui, for the crime of enticing a woman under the age of twenty and disrupting a family. The plaintiff's statement roughly claims that the plaintiff has a daughter named Yu Ying, who, at the age of fifteen, became a dancer at the Saint Anna Dance Hall and later changed her name to Manli. Because his daughter was beautiful and skilled, her life was quite good. At that time, his daughter was once married as a concubine to Liu Huizhi, the former chairman of the China Industrial Bank, and lived together at No. 48 Zhongshi Xincun, Yuyuan Road. Soon after, due to disagreements, Liu paid a large sum to sign an agreement and terminate the relationship. Then the plaintiff's whole family also moved into Zhongshi Xincun to live together. Last spring, his daughter resumed her career at the Vienna Garden Dance Hall and soon met the defendant Zhu Ruifu and fell in love. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 18th of last month, his daughter suddenly left home and never returned. After inquiring with the gatekeeper and the Zhongshi Xincun building supervisor, he learned that the defendant had hired a Xiang Sheng taxi that morning, arrived at Zhongshi Xincun, and enticed the plaintiff's daughter away from home and has not been seen since. Therefore, the defendant is clearly guilty of enticing a woman under the age of twenty, causing her to leave the person with parental rights, and should be punished according to the law. Zhu Ruifu also hired lawyer Chen Ying to file a countersuit for slander. The main points are: Zhu's ancestral home is in Anhui, from a prominent family, with ancestral property, known as wealthy gentry. Even in Shanghai, he owns houses and properties. He is now a shareholder of Jiu Fu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and serves as the general manager as a director. The company has capital of 200,000 yuan, and annual turnover is even more than several hundred thousand yuan. He has already married and has children. His brothers are well-known figures in Shanghai's financial circles. Chen Musen's behavior is despicable and his poverty is so extreme that he cannot support himself. He has long wanted to remarry or sell his daughter Yu Ying, but his plans have failed. He is now using a criminal charge as a tool of blackmail, and he intends to gain Yu Ying's private savings and private property through the establishment of this criminal charge. The plaintiff not only has a solid family background and upright character, but is also trusted to be the general manager of such a large company. Chen Musen's daughter works as a dancer, and even if she has some savings, as well as the proceeds from Musen selling her as a concubine, the amount is extremely small. With the plaintiff's status, how could he covet and falsely accuse her of getting both money and a person? This is pure slander. Moreover, he claims that after his daughter began associating with the plaintiff, the plaintiff gave her 200 yuan per month for living expenses. The statements in the front and back are contradictory. The plaintiff and his daughter only have a friendly relationship. They did not become a concubine, nor did they rent a house to live together. Only last year, when his daughter stopped dancing in the summer, her interest income was not enough to cover expenses, so he gave her 200 yuan per month to help each other as friends. He mistakenly thought he had a chance and instigated his wife, Ding Yueqiu, to come to Shanghai to force his daughter to live with them, causing frequent quarrels and even violence. In order to maintain the relationship between his mother and daughter, the plaintiff broke off contact with her in March of this year. Unexpectedly, Chen repeatedly tried to extort money but failed. Seeing that there was indeed a break with his daughter, he turned to his daughter to seize property. According to Yu Ying, at that time, Yu Ying discovered that all her savings had been secretly changed by her father, Chen Musen, to his own name. When Yu Ying went to the bank to correct the account name, Chen violently opposed it. Not long after, he demanded grain fields in his hometown. Yu Ying commissioned lawyer Chen Ying to represent her in negotiations, unable to bear the pressure from her parents. She agreed to allocate the annual income from the property to the two elders as support, but they completely occupied the property, drafted a document falsely claiming that everything was their own. Yu Ying did not agree, and Chen took advantage of Yu Ying's absence to dance, broke into the bedroom, broke the lock in the cabinet, and took away the key to the safe, and took away savings, seals, and 750 yuan. When Yu Ying discovered this, she invited lawyer Chen to rush to the Four Lines Safe Deposit Box to check. Indeed, it had already been done. The bank clerk learned the details and allowed the reporting of a loss. She resented her parents' greed and commissioned lawyer Chen to send a letter questioning them. They became angry and fabricated a story and published it in the newspaper. Yu Ying respected ethics and wrote a long letter of admonishment, but they claimed that their daughter was missing. The correspondence was incomprehensible, and there was no parental affection. His daughter works as a dancer, and all those she knows can become partners. Legally, there is no question of enticement. Yu Ying is still dancing and absolutely free, so there is no harm to be done. His daughter danced at the age of fourteen and was once sold as a concubine. She already has the capacity for action, fabricating stories out of thin air, intending to defraud money, with malicious intent. He should be severely punished. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Chen Kangsun opened the Fourth Criminal Court for trial. The plaintiff Chen Musen, accompanied by his lawyer Su Fuchou and witnesses, appeared in court. The defendant Zhu Ruifu also appeared in court with his defense lawyer and Chen Manhui to answer questions. First, Chen Manli testified that she was nineteen years old and Chen Musen's biological daughter. She had previously been married to Liu Huizhi as a concubine, but soon separated. At that time, Liu gave me a large amount of cash and jewelry, and my father also took a share. Because my father liked vanity and squandered everything, he then forcibly seized my private savings. I refused, so the relationship between father and daughter deteriorated. Then we signed an agreement to sever the relationship between father and daughter and live separately. As for the defendant Zhu Ruifu, he is my friend. The accusation this time is a complete injustice, because the defendant did not entice me away. Then the court questioned the plaintiff's witnesses, the Zhongshi Xincun building supervisor Wang Zhixiang, and the maid Wu Abao, who both insisted that on the morning of the 18th of last month, they had witnessed the defendant and the plaintiff's daughter leaving home together and not returning. Then, Xiang Sheng taxi driver Jiang Linlin testified that on the morning of the 18th of last month, the defendant had hired the taxi I was on duty in and driven to the entrance of Zhongshi Xincun, where the defendant entered and brought a woman onto the car and ordered me to drive to the New New Hotel. The court verified the statements and questioned the defendant Zhu Ruifu, who still flatly denied it. At this point in the trial, after the lawyers on both sides argued, the court declared the trial concluded and scheduled sentencing for the 30th of this month.

### A Severed Male Hand Discovered on the Beach at Dongjiadu

The Wound is the Same as the Previous Right Foot, Undoubtedly from the Same Body; Reported to the Court for Examination

The Shanghai Waterworks Plant in Yangshupu, Public Concession, on the 5th of this month, while dredging on the beach, suddenly scooped up a man's right foot. Because it was mixed in the mud, no one noticed it. After several days, it was discovered. The matter was reported to the Yulin Road police station, which notified the Customs Water Police. The remains were taken back and detectives were sent to the court to commission an official to examine them. It was determined that it was cut off two or three inches above the ankle bone, and the wound was smooth, as if it had been injured by a sharp ax. The Lifesaving Bureau was ordered to collect and bury the remains first. The details have been published in this newspaper. It is now known that around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, a man's right hand suddenly floated up on the beach near Pier No. 18, Dongjiadu, Nanshi.

The Nanshi Lifesaving Bureau retrieved the severed hand and reported it to the court for examination.

### Wang Xinggao is Missing; Limited Time to Hand Over the Case Under Bail

Wang Must Be Handed Over by the Morning of July 2nd; Wang's Wife Claims He Will Not Escape and Implicate the Guarantors

Wang Xinggao, a native of Funing, who was instigated to assassinate Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World, was reported to the French police by the perpetrator Zhao Guangfu. Wang was arrested and sent to the First Special Court, which sentenced him to life imprisonment and deprived him of his civil rights for life. Wang appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, which overturned the original judgment and acquitted him. During the appeal, he was allowed to be released on 20,000 yuan bail, subject to recall at any time. Because the French Police Department disagreed with the Third Branch of the High Court's acquittal, it requested the prosecutor of the Third Branch of the High Court to appeal to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has already overturned the Second Instance acquittal and remanded the case to the Third Branch of the High Court for a new trial. The day before yesterday morning, Judge Chen Daqi opened a mediation hearing. Because Wang Xinggao was absent from Shanghai, only Sun Jinlang, the manager of the Asia Hotel, was questioned. It was announced that the hearing would be postponed. The details were published in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, the Third Branch of the High Court again summoned Wang's guarantors Huang Shijie (owner of Hongda Rice Store on West Aihamus Road), Zhang Gengshan (owner of Jinshun Coal Store on Jin Shenfu Road), Chen Guojun (owner of Yongmao Rice Store on Kaiziyun Road), Jin Changqing (manager of Xinquan Bathhouse at No. 199 Lafayette Road), Zhang Shuzhou (accountant of Dachengxiang Foreign Goods Store at the intersection of Ximen Road and Beller Road), Li Meidong (Meidong Store on Baer Road), and Yu Pinru (manager of Nanxinxing Native Products Store in Qianjiatang), and other seven people, to open a court hearing in the afternoon. The seven guarantors arrived on time to report. At 3:30 PM, Criminal Court President Wu Tingqi, along with Judges Chen Daqi and Wang Yue, arrived at the Third Criminal Court and summoned the seven guarantors for questioning. Among the seven guarantors, Li Meidong was represented by lawyer Zhang Diming, commissioned by Wang Yiting, who stated that the Meidong Store was sold by Li Meidong to Wang Yiting on May 23 of this year and renamed Meidong Company. Li Meidong has already gone to the three northeastern provinces and should be responsible for guaranteeing Wang Xinggao, etc. Zhang Shuzhou was represented by Lin Zihe, who stated that Zhang Shuzhou is the accountant of Dachengxiang and stopped working due to embezzlement at the end of last year along with the manager. I took over as manager this year, and the store owner Zhang Jinkui knows about guaranteeing Wang and Gao, and he asked me to come to court today, etc. The official asked each guarantor where Wang and Gao had gone. Each guarantor said they did not know. The judgment and summons were delivered to Wang Xinggao's wife, who said that she did not know where he had gone, but he would definitely not escape and implicate the guarantors, and he would definitely be brought to justice. The official said that you were initially allowed to guarantee that Wang Xinggao would not leave Shanghai, but now Wang Xinggao is missing. You are not only responsible for the 20,000 yuan guarantee, but also for the criminal responsibility of facilitating his escape. The guarantors all requested a grace period to notify Wang Xinggao to come to court. After the court deliberated, it ordered each guarantor to hand over Wang by the 30th of this month. If they violated this, the guarantors would be transferred for investigation. The guarantors listened to the order and unanimously requested an extension of two weeks. The court granted an extension until 9:00 AM on July 2nd to hand over the person, and then adjourned the court.

Of the three small packets, two contained heroin, and the other was also glucose. When questioned, the defendant Chen Deji confessed that the drugs were entirely made by the Russian Maiti Luo, who mixed a small amount of heroin with glucose and sold it as a substitute to the Japanese. One day, Maiti Luo gave me a note, instructing me to go to Ji Ming, a Korean at No. 25 Deshun Lane, Qiujiang Road, to collect 30 or 35 yuan. I went to meet Ji Ming and asked him for the money. Ji Ming handed me a bottle of medicinal powder and told me to take it back to Maiti Luo. I took the bottle back to the hotel and was arrested. Pan Jialu confessed that he knew nothing about drug trafficking. On that day, he had agreed to meet Chen Deji at the Anle Hotel to discuss coal mining matters and was arrested. When questioned, the Russian Maiti Luo stammered and said that Chen did it, etc. After the lawyers on both sides argued, Judge Huang sentenced Chen Deji and Maiti Luo to twelve years of imprisonment each for drug trafficking and deprived them of their civil rights for ten years each.

At 6:30 AM on the 9th of this month, he was driving a car past the vicinity of Lanhua Road, Huade Road, when he saw Zhang Zhangshi, a female worker from Hangzhou, walking slowly. Because Kan often teased her in the factory, and his desires were not fulfilled, he used the car to circle around her, flirting. Accidentally, he knocked her down, and the wheels injured her abdomen. She was three months pregnant and suffered a blow to her womb, screaming in pain. Kan sped away in the car. Hua Tan Zhao Baosheng from the Yulin Road police station arrived after hearing the alarm and helped her up, questioning her about the details. He hired a car to send her back to her home. Unexpectedly, she miscarried the next day. Her husband Zhang Yongkang reported the situation to the Yulin Road police station, who sent Hua Tan Zhao secretly to the factory and arrested Kan, sending him to the First Special Court. Because Gai could not appear in court to testify, the court ordered him to be remanded and postponed the trial. Yesterday, Judge Dai Rongduo resumed the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted him for injury under Article 278 of the Criminal Law, and stated that the Zhang Yongtang couple had both appeared in court, stating that during the postponement, the defendant's family had persuaded people to reconcile at their home, so they did not intend to pursue the matter.

### Barber Shop Owner Colludes in Rape and Abduction of Adopted Daughter

The Girl Was About to Go to the Wharf to Take a Steamer When the Old Woman Detected It and They Were Arrested Together

Hu Qilong, a tenant from Yangzhou, 56 years old, lived upstairs in the Yongxing Barber Shop at 245 Feihong Road, Zhabei. He had adopted a girl from the same hometown, Hu Gendi, as a child bride since she was young. The girl, now 18 years old, has a beautiful appearance, and Lu Changsheng, the 19-year-old Yangzhou barber shop owner, coveted her. On the afternoon of the twelfth day of the first month of the lunar calendar this year, he lured the girl to a small hotel under the pretext of inviting her to watch a play and violated her chastity. From then on, Hu’s innocence was tarnished. Lu, fearing that the secret would be revealed one day and bring disaster upon himself, had the ingenious idea of instigating Zhu Yongtai, a 21-year-old Yangzhou shop assistant, to use sweet words to seduce Hu. The day before yesterday afternoon, he took the girl to the Huishan Hotel on Huishan Road for illicit relations and threatened her to flee to their original hometown of Yangzhou to hide. The young and inexperienced Hu was indeed bewildered and quietly left home at about 8:00 a.m. yesterday morning, taking twelve pieces of cotton sheets and clothes, and met with Zhu Yongtai, intending to go to the Nanshi wharf to board a steamer. Unexpectedly, the plot was discovered by Hu Qilong, the girl's adoptive father, who detected Zhu's conspiracy. He reported it to the police station, which dispatched police officers to arrest Zhu Yongtai, Lu Changsheng, and the abducted Hu Gendi. After questioning them, they were transferred to the local court for trial and punishment because the case involved rape and abduction of a young girl, which was a serious matter.

### The Case of the Dancing Girl Tang Xiangying Being Appealed is Concluded

Sentencing Scheduled for 2:00 PM on the 30th

Tang Xiangying, a local cashier and dancer, was reported to the police by Zheng Fengying, the wife of Yang Shande, the former military governor of Zhejiang, for having an adulterous relationship with Yang Qingchang, the son of Yang Shande. The police arrested Tang Xiangying and Yang Qingchang and brought them to the Second Special Court for prosecution. The court sentenced them to two months of imprisonment and allowed them to commute the sentence to a fine of two yuan per day. However, after Yang Qingchang was released, he still did not return home. His wife, Zheng Fengying, believed that Tang Xiangying had deliberately seduced and enticed her husband not to return home, so she hired lawyer Wu Chengyu to file a private prosecution against Tang Xiangying for disrupting the family in the Second Special Court's criminal court, and also filed an ancillary civil lawsuit, seeking to recover 10,000 yuan in compensation for reputational damage. After trial by Judge Liao Yiwu, the head of the criminal court, Tang Xiangying was found not guilty, and the ancillary civil lawsuit was dismissed. Zheng Fengying was not satisfied with the original judgment and was determined to have Tang Xiangying convicted and compensated, so she hired lawyer Wu to file an appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. After Judge Wang Yue opened an investigation hearing to summon witnesses for questioning, the Higher Court's presiding judge Wu Tingqi, along with Judges Wang and Chen, and Prosecutor Dong, opened a collegial panel for trial yesterday. Appellant Yang Zhengfengying, along with lawyer Wu Chengyu, and appellee Tang Xiangying, along with defense lawyers Chen Tingrui and Chen Guocai, appeared in court. After the court questioned both parties in detail, it was declared that the case was clear, and after ordering arguments, it was adjourned, with the sentencing scheduled for 2:00 PM on the 30th.

### Female Tea House Employee of New-New Company Deceived

Guan Afu Already Has a Wife - Arrested and Sent to Court for Legal Action

Qian Yueying, a 24-year-old female tea house employee from Jiaxing at the New-New Company's Yangzhou Theater, met a tourist named Guan Afu, a 27-year-old from Suzhou, two months ago. After Afu got to know Yueying, he often went to the company to play, so the two developed a physical relationship from friendship. On the seventh day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar, Guan borrowed a small pavilion room at No. 7 Kaifeng Road, Zhabei, and invited Yueying to live with him. Yueying moved her wardrobe and belongings in, and they lived together like a couple. Unexpectedly, the room was emptied when Yueying went to work at the company as usual the day before yesterday and returned home in the evening. She was very frustrated, but there was nothing she could do. At this point, Yueying knew that she had been deceived and searched everywhere. She found Guan Afu at No. 485 Hengfeng Road and, knowing that Guan already had a wife, immediately handed him over to police officer Zhang Jianqiu of the 11th precinct, along with all the details. According to Yueying, Guan Afu initially deceived her by saying that he did not have a wife, but she was deceived. She was also deceived out of two wardrobes containing clothes worth more than 100 yuan. Now, I don't even have any clothes to change, so I have no choice but to ask him to return the original items and to be severely punished according to the law. Guan Afu claimed to be a tailor and said that because Qian Yueying wanted him to divorce Jin, his wife, he refused, so he took one of her boxes, but the items for renting the house were all bought with his money, etc. Guan Afu's wife, Jin, also brought a child to the station, and her testimony was similar to Guan Afu's. After verifying the testimonies, the investigating officer, considering the case involved accusations of adultery and deception, ordered that they be sent to the Shanghai Local Court for trial at about 4:00 PM yesterday.

Sentencing on the 30th - Defendant Released on Bail

Chen Huizhen, a 19-year-old girl from Anhui, used to work as a maid for a certain Sichuan family. Because of her good looks and graceful figure, she was easily pursued by men. Her period was near, and her emotions were open, so she was seduced and had a private affair with Chen Yonghai, a colleague. Unexpectedly, a fetus was conceived and was already two months old. Fearing that it would be revealed one day and she would be blamed by her parents, she consulted Wang Wang, a Suzhou woman (24 years old) and a close friend from the factory. Wang introduced her to a midwife named Zhu Xushi, who took a medicinal herb for 20 yuan and inserted it into her lower body, causing a blood clot to fall off. Because she was too tired to move and it was difficult to return home, she stayed at a hotel on Carter Road.

On the eighth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar, she had an abortion at a hotel on Carter Road, using a medicinal herb inserted into Chen Huizhen's lower body. At that time, the fetus fell off, and I paid Zhu Xushi 20 yuan. Zhu Xushi gave me two yuan, and I didn't introduce anyone else, etc. The court concluded the arguments and will announce the sentencing on the 30th of this month. The defendant was released on bail.

### Commercial Press Creates Copper-Plated Type Molds

Ministry of Industry Grants Patent - Special Price Sale for Four Months

Type molds are the basic equipment for typecasting, but the commonly used copper molds are not only expensive but also time-consuming to manufacture, which hinders the development of culture. The Commercial Press, which has been engaged in the printing business for more than 40 years, has always been committed to improving printing. It has long planned to innovate type molds to solve the difficulties for the printing industry. After several years of research and multiple improvements, it has finally completed the copper-plated type mold plan. This type of mold has the advantages of copper molds and none of the disadvantages. Its greatest features are three: ⑴ Durable: This type of copper-plated type mold has been tested by the Research Institute of Jiaotong University, proving that the compressive strength of each square centimeter is 1937.9 kg, which has the same durability as copper molds. The cast lead type has clear strokes, just like copper molds. ⑵ Lightweight: The weight of the copper-plated type mold is only one-sixth of that of a copper mold, making it easy to store and transfer. ⑶ Affordable: Because copper-plated type molds are mass-produced, the cost is lower. The company also offers a special price sale for the first four months of its release, with each set selling for only 200-300 yuan, which is about one-fourth of the price of copper molds. This is an unprecedented low price in the type mold industry, and even smaller inland printing shops can easily purchase them. It is heard that this type of copper-plated type mold has been rewarded by the Ministry of Industry and granted a patent. The company has now prepared sufficient stock and has begun to sell them. The company has detailed instructions for reference. Inland printing companies and newspapers can also order from the company's branches in various places, which is extremely convenient.

### Heroes of Past and Present

— Jingguan

When watching Beijing opera, I love to watch the full-fledged martial arts scenes. When reading old novels, I love to read about chivalrous stories. Because there are some heroic qualities in them that I like.

Individual heroism is undesirable, but I think many of the heroic qualities are quite desirable.

Whether it's murder or arson, be responsible for all actions. Even some flower-picking bandits, who insulted women in the dark of night, would always leave a mark on the wall to tell people that they did this bad thing. Isn't it also straightforward and lovely to be so honest and clear?

The name "hero" is now trampled underfoot. In reality, there are various styles of heroes that still exist. However, they no longer wear night-walking clothes. From their appearance, they are all gentle and refined, very much like the standard citizens of the gentleman's country.

Naturally, they are not as honest as before.

When Liu Bang became emperor, he didn't need to ask scholars, saying, "I conquered the world on horseback, what use is poetry and books?" If he were born in modern times, even if he still used a pistol to govern the country and pacify the world, he would definitely take the lead himself.

The rogue seduces women on the battlefield of love, which is very brave. But when he goes to court, he says, "She is a prostitute!" Or he says that the woman took the initiative and intentionally aroused his sexual desire. It turns out that the gentleman was fooled by others.

This is the martial hero; the literary hero does it differently.

However, there are also new inventions, like Ms. Su Xuelin, who sprays dog blood on the heads of the dead, covering them with dirt so that they cannot move or speak.

In the writings of the Spanish literary giant Cervantes, there was a hero, Don Quixote. Some people say, "I am Don Quixote." But Mr. Quixote challenged the windmill and was swept away by it. The lesson of the past can be learned: wait for the windmill to stop before holding your spear, leaping on your horse, and pretending to stab at it!

Daring to act and not asking whether it is right or wrong is very close to heroic behavior, and I admire it. However, our modern heroes, please show a little heroic spirit and wash off the powder that you personally put on your face before you come.

### Hu Mingsan

— Majia

These few days, I am really too busy to catch my breath. There is nothing I can do about it; being a teacher at a private primary school is a fate that one deserves. It's the end-of-term exams: write questions, hand them to the principal for review; if they are wrong, write them again; if they are right, engrave the stencils, and then, mimeograph them.

The children are also working harder than usual, always holding a book, chanting the books like monks chanting scriptures. They are not like usual, teasing people and jumping around, showing their innocent faces and making loud, piercing laughter. When they see me, they all swarm around me, and the chattering voices ask me so many questions that I don't know which one to answer.

"Teacher ×, are the questions easy?"

Looking at their innocence, my originally depressed and irritable mood is like a sultry summer day, suddenly having a cool rain shower, making people feel relaxed in their hearts. I only show a relieved smile, forgetting the fatigue that made me breathless. I say:

"Very easy! I guarantee you will all pass!"

My eyes, shining with pleasure, swept around the children. However, I met a pair of deep black, big eyes. They attracted my gaze like a magnet attracting a steel needle. I found that those deep black, big eyes were still so naughty, often being scolded by me. This twelve-year-old child, Hu Mingsan, is now very quiet, and from his deep black, big eyes, people can see that his small heart is harboring some kind of painful, seemingly unspeakable secret. He stared at me blankly, as if he had not yet noticed that I was staring at him. I was deeply surprised, and I called him:

"Hu Mingsan, are you worried about the exam?"

He was startled as if he had been hit by someone. Then, his deep black eyes immediately became wet. I asked him again:

"Hu Mingsan, are you worried about the exam?"

He forced a smile. I saw his lips trembling, and his deep black, big eyes became wet again. The classmates were mocking him: "Hu Mingsan! Make a funny face for us to see!" He did not make a funny face as usual; instead, he ran away in a puff of smoke.

The bell rang for class, and I walked into the classroom with the exam papers. The children saluted me. I just widened my eyes, searching for those deep black, big eyes, because I urgently needed to know what was hidden inside.

I saw them. They were so dejected, constantly glancing around the classroom, as if the exam had nothing to do with him. He held his pencil and eraser in a careless manner.

He was the first to hand in his paper, with his head drooping, dragging his slow steps, and walking out of the classroom. I watched him disappear into my surprised eyes, not understanding.

After lunch, I walked out of the dining hall. In the corridor, I saw him. He really looked worried, hanging his head and pacing back and forth. I called out to him. He looked at me, and his eyes became wet again. I questioned him. He said, as if he had no choice, "I can't study anymore. I'm going to learn a trade!..." He suddenly struggled out of my grasp, and he ran away. I saw his hands quickly wiping his eyes.

"Oh! So that's how it is?" I murmured to myself. I was so moved that tears fell. "In this world, children also have suffering..." I also quickly wiped my eyes with my hands.
