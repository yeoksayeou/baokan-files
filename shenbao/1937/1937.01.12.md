[Luoyang] Liu Zhi, the Director of the Henan-Anhui Pacification Headquarters, recently sent separate telegrams to Yu Xuezhong and Wang Yizhe, sincerely urging them to consider the difficult times, follow the central government's designated locations for relocation, reassure the people, and stabilize the western frontier. The two telegrams are as follows:

(1) To Yu Xuezhong: "Recently, I read the central government's telegrams, which are reasonable and considerate, showing generosity to Han Xiang's past and planning for your future. The considerations are extremely appropriate and thorough. Even if you were in their position, you could not have done better. Men should regard fame and fortune as fleeting clouds, and pledge loyalty to the bright sun. If you see good, follow it; if you know your mistakes, correct them. You should not harbor any protectionism or deviate from your original intentions. I hope you will consider the difficult times, deeply consider the foundation of the country, reassure the people, and stabilize the western frontier, carefully preserving Han Xiang's good reputation and saving the people's vitality. Please do not cling to small-mindedness and focus only on the moment. The Northeast troops have been struggling on difficult roads for years, often with their families, suffering from hunger and poverty. Thinking of them is heartbreaking. My brother's patriotism and loyalty to the party have always been enthusiastic. I hope you will consider my frank words."

(2) To Wang Yizhe: "Currently, the international situation is so serious that only national unity and sincere solidarity can save the country and ensure its survival. The central government has made extremely fair arrangements based on reason and compassion. I hope you will embrace your patriotic heart and take the lead in following the designated locations for relocation, reassuring the people, stabilizing the western frontier, dispelling darkness and bringing harmony, and establishing lasting merit and fame. This is not a task for others. The clouds of Qin are in sight. I sincerely hope for your good intentions." (Eleventh Dispatch from the Central News Agency)

[Nanjing] According to someone who came to Nanjing from Xi'an, the wife of President Yu of the Control Yuan returned to Shaanxi due to her mother's illness. During the Xi'an Incident, Sun Weiru's army headquarters was stationed in Sanyuan. Mrs. Yu obtained a car from Sun and went to Xi'an to confront Yang Hucheng, scolding him for his injustice and strongly criticizing his actions. Yang Hucheng was very alarmed. After Chairman Chiang returned to Nanjing, the situation in Xi'an remained chaotic. Mrs. Yu went to Xi'an again to confront Yang Hucheng. Currently, Sun Weiru's troops are still stationed in the Sanyuan area, and many residents of Sanyuan have fled back to their hometowns to avoid the disaster. (Eleventh Dispatch)

[Nanjing] Zhang Fang, the Commander-in-Chief of the 24th Route Army, although from Henan, grew up in Shaanxi and previously served as the deputy commander of President Yu's National Pacification Army. Many of the Shaanxi military officers were his former subordinates. Recently, because Yang Hucheng has not yet followed the central government's orders, he sent a special telegram to Yang, earnestly advising him to quickly repent. (Eleventh Dispatch)

[Xuzhou] The Xi'an section of the Longhai Railway is temporarily managed by Zhang Hongyan, the chief of the railway bureau. Contact with the eastern section of Tongguan has been lost. However, traffic has resumed on the Chishui to Baoji section. The Tongguan-Xi'an Engineering Bureau stopped construction westward after the Shaanxi Incident, and all employees returned to Zhengzhou to await orders. Passengers are crowded between Bian, Zheng, Luo, and Tongguan, and the railway is adding extra trains. However, freight transportation is not smooth, and commodity prices in Bian, Zheng, Luo, and Shaanxi are soaring. (Eleventh Dispatch from the Central News Agency)

[Nanjing] Since being pardoned, Zhang Xueliang has been enjoying himself by reading books and rarely seeing guests. Because Yu and Yang have not yet accepted the central government's orders, he is deeply concerned. He sent a special telegram to Gansu, urging Yu Xuezhong to order his troops to obey the central government's arrangements. It is also learned that President Yu Youren of the Control Yuan sent another long telegram from Shanghai to Yang Hucheng on the 10th, urging him to come to his senses. (Eleventh Dispatch)

[Nanjing] The post-incident measures for Shaanxi and Gansu, which were promulgated many days ago, have not yet been implemented, and the situation there is quite tense. According to Zhao Bulian, the director of the Taiyuan Pacification Commissioner's Office, the central government has announced measures for handling the aftermath of the Xi'an Incident. At a time when foreign aggression is imminent and Suiyuan is under pressure, Commissioner Yan hopes that Yu Xuezhong and Yang Hucheng will accept the central government's measures, obey orders, maintain local peace and security, and prevent the Communists from succeeding. Otherwise, the people of Shaanxi and Gansu will be in dire straits and unable to extricate themselves. As for the Suiyuan Incident, the fighting has subsided due to the cold weather, but the intention of a certain party to invade Suiyuan has not diminished. Amidst the tension in Suiyuan, the Communists in Shaanxi are also causing trouble. Commissioner Yan has ordered strict precautions. He added that he will go to Shanghai tomorrow to greet Chairman Wang on behalf of Yan. It is still uncertain whether Yan will be able to find time to come to Nanjing for the Third Plenary Session. (Eleventh Dispatch)

[Nanjing] The Workers' Welfare Association sent a telegram to Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong, saying, "You were the initiators of the Xi'an Incident. The central government and Chairman Chiang are benevolent and generous, and have not imposed severe punishment. How should you express your gratitude and repentance, atone for your sins, obey orders, and defend the border? All of our compatriots will not discriminate against you and the generals and soldiers of Shaanxi and Gansu because of this incident. We hope you will be courageous in repentance, pull back from the precipice, obey the central government, and strive to repay the country. You must know that revolutionary armed forces are the people's armed forces. Soldiers should not have feudal tribal ideas. Disobeying the central government's orders is violating the people's will and becoming the enemy of the entire nation. Please think carefully and choose wisely." At the same time, they wrote to the Central Executive Committee, asking them to impose strict sanctions on Yang and Yu if they remain unrepentant, in order to rectify discipline and eliminate the source of chaos. The city's workers pledge to be their backing. (Eleventh Dispatch)

Chairman Zhou Lu gave an impromptu report on his personal thoughts regarding the current situation. The meeting adjourned at 9:30 AM. (Central News Agency dispatch, 11th)

[Nanjing] The National Government held its memorial week at 9 AM on the 11th. Attendees included Deng Jiayan, Jing Hengyi, Cheng Qian, Chu Minyi, Chen Xunyong, Chen Qicai, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials from the National Government and various ministries and commissions, totaling over 400 people. After leading the assembly in observing ceremonial rites, Chairman Lin gave an impromptu speech on "Psychological National Defense." He began by stating that the meaning of national defense could be interpreted in two ways: first, national defense in a broad sense, encompassing political, economic, and cultural aspects, referring to both spiritual and material national defense; second, national defense in a narrow sense, referring specifically to the country's military strength. National defense in a broad sense, in other words, is the collective power of the entire nation to resist aggression. The external aggression that modern nations experience can be divided into four types: political, economic, cultural, and military. Military aggression is felt immediately, while political, economic, and cultural aggression are gradual and not easily perceived at first. However, their harmful effects are more profound than military aggression. Therefore, in today's world, it is not enough to focus solely on military strength to resist aggression from all sides; it is essential to seek national defense in a broad sense to be effective. He further stated that "psychological national defense," as one aspect of the broader concept, refers to the psychological strength of the entire nation to resist aggression, which can be said to be the foundation of all national defense. Based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings on "psychological reconstruction," he elaborated on why psychological national defense is more important than material national defense. He reiterated that to unite the 400 million people of China and establish solid psychological national defense, we should start with the following three points: ❶ Recognize ourselves, and understand the perilous position in which our nation finds itself. ❷ Establish a common belief in the Three Principles of the People. ❸ Restore the nation's self-confidence and self-esteem. In recent years, the national mindset has been seeking peace and unity internally, and peace and independence externally. The internal mindset has fully demonstrated its strength, and the external mindset is gradually becoming more focused. He further expressed his hope that the entire nation, from top to bottom, would use this psychological national defense as a foundation and work together to establish total national defense. (Central News Agency dispatch, 11th)

[Nanjing] Zhou Lu gave a report at the Central Memorial Week on the 11th, entitled "Review of the Past Year and Hopes for the Future." The original text stated: "Today's report is my personal perspective on 'Review of the Past Year and Hopes for the Future.' In the past year, there has been significant progress in the political arena, which we can observe in both foreign and domestic relations. First, regarding foreign relations, everyone knows that China cannot survive without active development. Since September 18th Incident, the government has been preparing in the military, financial, international, and other areas, but people inevitably had some doubts about the central government's determination to work hard. Over the past year, this has gradually gained widespread recognition in the country. Until the Suiyuan Incident, the entire nation increasingly trusted the government, resulting in the unification of the national will. On the other hand, it has enhanced our country's international standing. Comrades, you must understand that the unification of the people's will is the most fundamental condition for revival. It is truly a cause for great rejoicing that our Party achieved this in the past year. Regarding domestic relations, the Liangguang Incident occurred last summer, and the Xi'an Incident occurred in December. Although their nature differed, the final resolution was achieved through peaceful means, avoiding military action and preserving much of the nation's vitality. During the Xi'an Incident, Chiang Kai-shek initially adopted an unyielding attitude in the face of Zhang Xueliang's threats, but after Zhang Xueliang repented, he requested a special pardon for him. This dignified and magnanimous demeanor was not only emulated throughout the country, but also greatly praised by foreign newspapers. Furthermore, when the country faced such a major crisis, the entire nation was able to express its support for the central government in a unified and enthusiastic manner. This demonstrates that the people's concept of the country is much more advanced than before, and their understanding of national affairs is more profound than before. This progress of the people is a very gratifying thing. Comrades, the year 1936 has become a thing of the past. All previous unfortunate events should pass away with the past, never to be seen again. After the start of 1937, we must not allow the dissipation of national strength, and even less should we follow in the footsteps of Spain, turning China into an international battlefield and inviting irreversible catastrophe. We must unite everyone and further strengthen our Party to lead the entire nation in overcoming national difficulties. We must use the spirit of leading the National Revolution to lead the National Revolution. We believe that the people, who have already progressed, will fully accept the leadership of our Party, strengthen the government's power, resolve this serious national crisis, and complete the great mission of national revival. In the era of Zhenguan during the Tang Dynasty, when the country was largely settled, the emperor and his ministers still believed that founding the dynasty was difficult and maintaining it was not easy, and they strived to be diligent in consolidating the foundation of the country. Moreover, our country is not yet in a position to maintain what has been achieved, and even the founding has not been completed. In addition, the national crisis is becoming increasingly serious. Our Party bears this great responsibility and should always maintain a sense of crisis, concentrate the strength of the entire nation, and unify the will of the entire nation in order to complete the unfinished work of the revolution. This is what we earnestly hope for." (Central News Agency dispatch, 11th)

### Aftermath of the Beiping City Fire

[Beiping] After the Xidan Commercial Market was completely burned down, Song Zheyuan, considering the huge losses suffered by the merchants, convened a meeting this morning with Beiping Mayor Qin Dechun, Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Jiyan, Social Affairs Bureau Chief Lei Sishang, and Yang Zhaogeng, the director of political affairs, to discuss relief measures.

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Continuation of the Aid Suiyuan Movement

Since the outbreak of the war on the Suiyuan border, the economic assistance given by the entire country has shown a vigorous and surging momentum for a time. The consolation of wounded soldiers and the relief of people in disaster areas have been constantly planned and considered by people in the rear. A few days ago, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Finance, together with the standing committee of the Shanghai Charity Organizations United Association, loaded with relief goods, traveled to Suiyuan to console the wounded soldiers and offer rewards. This not only benefited the sick and the poor but also inspired a sense of confidence among the troops. The significance of the journey is extraordinary. However, with limited resources and many people in need, the distribution is ultimately insufficient. In addition, it is reported that the people in the border areas are suffering greatly and experiencing pain in the winter, making relief even more urgent. The Charity Organizations United Association in this city has already, based on the statements in the telegrams from the two standing committee members, sent letters to all sectors of society for extensive fundraising. We also very much want to fulfill our responsibility to promote this, in order to convey the hidden feelings of appeal. With sympathy in our hearts, we dare to ask for a hearing.

At the beginning of the Suiyuan War, the motivation for people across the country to contribute funds was primarily aimed at military strength. This was because the ferocious bandits were present and someone was behind them, providing them with supplies and weapons. Our border province was facing a difficult task, and it was difficult to cope with the situation unless military preparations were improved. Fortunately, we were able to recover important passes and frustrate the enemy, which was due to the inspiration of the masses, giving the soldiers the determination to fight to the death, as well as the abundant supplies, which eliminated the soldiers' worries about lack of supplies. Even today, the frontline war has temporarily stopped, but the conspiracy is still brewing. There is still no way to relax the military preparations. The burial of the remains of the war, the treatment of wounded soldiers, the compensation for fallen heroes, and the resettlement of displaced refugees all depend on the coordination of resources. We imagine the brave men groaning on their beds and the tragic state of their mutilated limbs, asking for whom they suffered and endured this pain. Our hearts are filled with sadness, and we cannot help but ask. Even those who survived the war, those families who were destroyed and displaced, are also our compatriots. How can we ignore them like the people of Qin and Yue? However, the urgent need for funds on one side is the focus, while the spirit of supporting the war on the other side has begun to decline. If this continues, the difficulties ahead are self-evident. Therefore, we must make strong and continuous efforts to continue the aid Suiyuan movement.

The significance of economic aid to Suiyuan, from a positive perspective, lies in increasing the strength of national defense preparations. From a negative perspective, it lies in reducing the pain in our hearts. Saving the nation and seeking survival is the responsibility of every citizen. The whole country should act together, without exception. Since we cannot wear armor and wield weapons to serve in the front lines, we can only contribute grain and grass to fulfill our responsibilities in the rear. Fortunately, as long as Suiyuan exists, we must do everything in our power. We must know that this action is equivalent to protecting our own heads, not like rescuing people in a well. Since its nature transcends the concept of charity, contributions should be made regardless of size or frequency. Only by everyone taking off their coats and donating generously, urging each other on, and using the spirit of "the more the better" to make continuous remittances, can we hope to achieve results, distribute them evenly, secure the border, boost morale, and benefit the disabled, the displaced, and the refugees. In this way, the anxieties long hidden in our hearts will also be slightly relieved.

### Three Thousand Japanese Volunteer Soldiers to Participate in the Spanish War

Tokyo Authorities Hear the News Like a Bolt from the Blue; Regard it as Malicious Propaganda from Europe

Gibraltar: According to reliable sources, 3,000 Japanese volunteer soldiers will soon arrive in Spain and land at the ports of Cadiz and Jerez. They will be immediately transferred to the Madrid front to join the 10,000 Italian volunteer soldiers who recently landed at the port of Cadiz and have now been transferred to Seville to join the Spanish National Army forces. According to news from the port of Cadiz, many boxes of aircraft parts manufactured in Italian factories were unloaded at the ports of Cadiz and Jerez and immediately assembled to meet the needs of the National Army. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

Gibraltar: A traveler who arrived here today from Cadiz brought a strange message, claiming that Jerez, Cadiz, is currently preparing to accommodate 5,000 Japanese soldiers who will arrive this week to participate in the Spanish Civil War. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

[London] People from all walks of life here are astonished to receive reports from Gibraltar that 3,000 Japanese volunteer soldiers are about to arrive in Spain to join the rebel army. They believe that this move by Japan will further worsen the situation in the Mediterranean. However, the above news has not yet been confirmed. (Express News Agency dispatch, 11th)

[Paris] The newspapers here are very interested after hearing that 3,000 Japanese volunteer soldiers are about to arrive in Spain to help the National Army and are eagerly awaiting a response from the Japanese officialdom. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

[Tokyo] The news that 5,000 volunteer teams will arrive in Cadiz to participate in the Spanish Civil War this morning was like a bolt from the blue in Tokyo. Although Germany and Japan have signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, Japan has not expressed any intention of intervening in the Spanish dispute diplomatically or militarily. Japanese newspapers and politicians have been criticizing Prime Minister Hirota for failing in his diplomatic policy towards China and Russia and for concluding an untimely German-Japanese agreement. From this point of view, it seems unlikely that the Japanese Prime Minister and his cabinet members would secretly allow untrained volunteer teams to go to the West and face opposition from the people. As for those who have been trained, if they go abroad to participate in the war, they must obtain the permission of the Japanese Emperor, which seems unlikely. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the news from Gibraltar was purely fabricated. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

[Tokyo] The semi-official news agencies of Britain and France, Havas and Reuters, have been spreading the news that several thousand Japanese volunteer soldiers will assist the Spanish revolutionary army and will land at Cadiz and Jerez on the west coast of Spain. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that this is the most malicious anti-propaganda aimed at exploiting the European political situation and is very angry. This is because the left-wing countries such as France and the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, which hopes to maintain the status quo in Europe, have suffered military setbacks in the recent war supported by the Spanish government army. Therefore, they are spreading the misunderstanding that Japan, which has joined the fascist camp due to the signing of the anti-aircraft agreement between Germany and Japan, has sent volunteers to participate in the Spanish war. It is expected that this kind of propaganda will worsen the opinion of various countries on the fascist camp and make the war favorable to the government army. It can be predicted that the first to spread this rumor was also the European countries that supported the Spanish government army. Although the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs dismissed this propaganda with a laugh, if it is left unattended, there is a risk that Japan's fair diplomatic policy towards Europe will be misunderstood by the world. Therefore, Foreign Minister Arita telegraphed Japanese ambassadors in Europe on the 11th to investigate the source of the rumor and at the same time requested the governments of the countries concerned to crack down on this malicious radio broadcast.

### British Government Puts Forward New Proposal to Five Nations

Advocates Promoting Supervisory Plans; France Expresses Complete Agreement

[London] Regarding the issue of prohibiting volunteers from going to Spain, the British government last night issued identical instructions to the ambassadors of France, Italy, Germany, Portugal, and Russia, ordering them to promptly notify their respective host governments of the British government's new proposal. The instructions are divided into eight sections, excerpted as follows:

㊀ All relevant governments have expressed their expectation to immediately adopt various measures to prohibit volunteers from going to Spain. Therefore, three measures have already been agreed upon by the relevant countries: firstly, the measures to prohibit volunteers should be implemented jointly by all participating countries; secondly, the entire issue of indirect interference in the Spanish civil war should also be actively addressed in order to achieve a resolution; thirdly, a practical and effective supervisory system should be established for the measures to prohibit volunteers.

㊁ Regarding the plan to supervise the sea and land borders of Spain, it is currently being considered by the parties involved in the Spanish civil war. The British government now suggests that this supervisory plan should be promoted to include the monitoring of all volunteers, military personnel, and military supplies arriving in Spain by sea and land.

㊂ For this supervisory plan to obtain satisfactory guarantees and effective implementation, the governments participating in the plan must be willing to fulfill their obligations sincerely. The British government believes that this condition can be practically achieved. However, it is possible that the relevant governments may have other views on the various supervisory measures and methods, in addition to those already stated above. If they would kindly provide instructions, the British government would be greatly pleased. In short, the British government is prepared to immediately consider any suggestions put forward to achieve this objective. Furthermore, the British government is also happy to consider any detailed suggestions put forward to monitor other forms of indirect interference, and is prepared to refer these suggestions to the Non-Intervention Committee for adjustment and discussion as a matter of priority.

㊃ At the same time, in the British government's own opinion, since the replies from other governments to the British government have all expressed a desire to prevent foreign volunteers and military personnel from being present in Spain, this expression should be a prelude to the implementation of the prohibition of volunteers going to Spain within the territory of each government. This prohibition can be implemented even before the supervisory system within Spain is fully established.

㊄ The British government intends to immediately and voluntarily issue a proclamation to draw the attention of the general public, making them aware that British subjects who accept recruitment or are willing to be recruited to join the armies of any party in the Spanish civil war are in violation of the "Foreign Enlistment Act" and will be punished accordingly. The same applies to those who recruit volunteers within the territory of the "United Kingdom" to fight in Spain.

㊅ The British government suggests that the official documents exchanged between the relevant countries since December 24th of last year (i.e., the date when the British and French notes were sent), together with this document, should be submitted to the Non-Intervention Committee. If the replies from each country unanimously agree with this suggestion, then the British government will request the Adjustment Committee to determine a date for each government to simultaneously implement the aforementioned measures to prohibit volunteers from going to Spain.

㊆ The British government does not wish to interfere with the actions of the Adjustment Committee. On the contrary, Britain believes that the notes presented by the British and French governments on December 24th are intended to facilitate the work of the Adjustment Committee.

㊇ Please instruct the British ambassadors to Germany, Italy, France, Portugal, and Russia to immediately notify the governments of their respective host countries of the British government's above-mentioned views, and request that they provide a reply as soon as possible. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

[Paris] The British Ambassador to France received instructions from the British government this afternoon to personally deliver the new British proposal regarding the prohibition of volunteers going to Spain to the Deputy Foreign Minister, Mr. Weiyeno. Official sources have stated that the French government will immediately express its full support for this proposal to the British government, and that the French government is prepared to request Parliament to pass laws early next week to stipulate various measures to prohibit volunteers from going to Spain, and to begin implementation when an agreement is reached with the governments of the relevant countries. The French government also intends to take this opportunity to announce these measures to Parliament, in order to expedite the implementation of supervisory measures for non-intervention in the Spanish civil war. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

[London] The British Foreign Office has just issued a public announcement, drawing public attention to the fact that the provisions stipulated in the "Foreign Enlistment Act" promulgated in 1870, especially Sections 4 and 5 of the law, are applicable to the current Spanish civil war. Any subject who violates these provisions shall be subject to imprisonment for up to two years, or a fine, or both penalties, according to law. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

### French Naval Exercises in the Western Mediterranean

Many British warships were also seen outside the port of Ceuta, and ten German submarines appeared in the same area yesterday. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

### France Will Absolutely Not Allow German Troops to Remain in North Africa

Spanish Moroccan Authorities Have Replied, Stating Their Willingness to Respect Treaties Between the Two Countries

[Paris] According to a spokesperson for the French Foreign Ministry today, France will resolutely not allow German troops to remain in Spanish Morocco. Today, France has sent a note to the National Army in Tetuan, the capital of Spanish Morocco. It is not yet possible to say what actions France will take if an unsatisfactory reply is received. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

[Paris] France has today issued a firm warning to Germany, forbidding Hitler from establishing a foothold in North Africa. Deputy Secretary of State De Saint, speaking in Belfort, stated, "Outsiders must understand that France will not be subdued by force. Therefore, if the flaunting of military power violates treaties or indirectly infringes upon France's rights, it will cut off the opportunity for a peaceful resolution." De Saint also quoted the statement of Prime Minister Blum, saying that France does not believe that war is inevitable and is striving to avoid it, but there are also several things that France cannot tolerate, such as Germany establishing a sphere of influence in North Africa. As for the extent to which Germany's influence in Morocco has expanded, it is currently impossible to know, but it is understood that German hired convoys have landed in Manlila, Tetuan, and near Ceuta. Therefore, the Foreign Office has drafted a protest, which will be submitted to General Franco if the Spanish National Army allows German troops to enter. A spokesperson said that this protest is of a warning nature, as France has stated that if the information currently obtained is confirmed, France will take appropriate measures to deal with it. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

### Reply from the Spanish Authorities

[Paris] The French government's note regarding the entry of Germans into Morocco has been satisfactorily answered by the Spanish authorities in Morocco. It is heard that the statement declares that the Spanish authorities do not wish to violate the Franco-Spanish agreements of 1904 and 1912. The Spanish authorities are well aware that the landing of foreign troops in any location in Morocco will cause serious international consequences. According to the Franco-Spanish agreement, foreign troops must not enter Moroccan territory. (The reply was issued by Colonel Pico-Beyde on behalf of General Franco, the leader of the Spanish National Army. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

### Hitler's Ambition

[Berlin] Diplomatic circles say that Germany's activities in Morocco are intended to create a situation that will provide a basis for future demands for African colonies. German leader Hitler believes that if unrest arises on the border of French Morocco, it may cause Britain and France to allow Germany to obtain a colonial center elsewhere. However, Hitler will not risk causing a conflict between France and Germany or between Britain and Germany. If he can obtain a considerable sphere of influence in Africa, he will be satisfied. Afterwards, he can cooperate with Britain and France to stop the Spanish civil war. Hitler's first ambition is to restore Germany's pre-World War colonial status, to avenge the shame of defeat, even if the scope is smaller. The second is to obtain commercial rights in Africa, as Germany's interests in Morocco are only commercial in nature. In the event of military involvement, Britain and France will have extremely severe reactions. However, Germany's ultimate goal will be to restore its pre-war African territories. (National Electric dispatch, 10th)

### Activities of German Troops in North Africa

Britain and France Receive Information

[Paris] The Paris Evening News recently published a report from the international neutral port of Tangier in North Africa, revealing the activities of Germany in Spanish Morocco, stating: ㊀ The High Commissioner's Office in Tetuan is now managed by German officers regarding scholars, police, and civil affairs. ㊁ The bombardment of the port of Ceuta is also managed by German officers. ㊂ Many German officers and thousands of Germans have settled in Spanish Morocco. ㊃ German naval commander Frole recently went to the Rif region, which is the area bordering French Morocco and Spanish Morocco, to inspect various military road locations. ㊄ Twenty-five German officers recently arrived in Tetuan by Portuguese plane. ㊅ Not long ago, 2,700 German troops landed at the ports of Ceuta and Manlila, and immediately went to the Darifen area to join the foreign legion, all wearing Spanish uniforms. ㊆ Twelve Moroccan indigenous officers are now preparing in Ceuta to receive a large number of German troops. ㊇ German technicians are currently engaged in mining work in various places in Spanish Morocco. In addition, there are 14,000 troops stationed throughout Spanish Morocco, and fortifications have been built in Ceuta and the area bordering French territory, and the airport in Tetuan has been expanded. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

[London] The British government has received information confirming that Germany has indeed had considerable activity in Spanish Morocco recently, but the claim that German troops have landed there has not yet been proven. In addition, it has been further confirmed that small-scale construction of forts is indeed underway in Ceuta, and is being assisted by German technicians. However, according to the information currently received, this project does not extend to the city itself (note that the city itself is owned by Spain and has a slightly different status from the territory of Spanish Morocco, as it is nominally under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Morocco). It is heard that Britain has reiterated that it does not consider the situation in Spanish Morocco to be very serious. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

### Amidst Worsening Franco-German Relations, Hitler Receives Diplomatic Corps

Says He is Willing to Seek Economic Cooperation with All Countries; Uses Radio for Anti-French Propaganda

[Berlin] The deterioration of Franco-German relations has never been greater since the Nazi Party took power. Hitler suddenly held a meeting today to receive the diplomatic representatives of various countries stationed in Berlin. The war of words between German and French newspapers is rapidly developing. For example, one newspaper pointed out that France wants to wage war in Morocco, and most newspapers say that Germany is willing to warn France at the last hour that Germany is not willing to be fooled. This matter involves the interests of Britain, and Britain must also pay serious attention to it. Foreign diplomats are currently speculating on the meaning of this movement in the German press. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

[Berlin] Today, German leader Hitler held a New Year's celebration meeting in Berlin, receiving diplomatic representatives of various countries stationed in Germany. French Ambassador Poncet, on behalf of the Vatican envoy Nansivo, who was unable to attend due to illness, congratulated Hitler. Poncet further expressed the hope that during this New Year, all parties can cooperate to seek future progress, so that all countries at home and abroad can enjoy true peace. Hitler replied that Germany is quite satisfied with the past year. We have increased Germany's economic independence, because we firmly believe that the only solid foundation for the world economy is the stability of individual economic conditions. Therefore, when we instill moral, political, and economic order in the German people, we are also serving the other people of the world. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

[Berlin] Hitler, accompanied by Propaganda Minister Goebbels, returned here yesterday from his villa in Berchtesgaden in Bavaria. That evening, all radio stations across the country broadcast three dispatches from Paris received by the semi-official German News Agency. The first dispatch stated that a Soviet Republic will now be established in southern France, with Perpignan in the department of Pyrénées-Orientales as its capital. The second dispatch stated that the French Army General Staff is currently drafting a plan to immediately occupy Spanish Morocco and annex it. The third dispatch stated that France is now planning to intervene in the Spanish civil war, making every effort to assist the Red Army in that country and resist the National Army led by General Franco, and is planning to take the opportunity to send troops to Spanish Morocco, so as to establish a French base opposite British Gibraltar. Well-informed sources in Berlin have recently interpreted these dispatches as saying that this propaganda movement was clearly ordered by leader Hitler and instructed by Propaganda Minister Goebbels to be carried out by the radio stations. Its intention is to target Britain and France obliquely. In fact, France's coveting of Spanish Morocco is unfounded. Germany's fabrication of this rumor is merely a smokescreen to cover up its conspiracy to violate the non-intervention agreement and send troops to Spain. As for the news issued by the German News Agency, its tone is as激烈 as the anti-Russian speeches delivered by senior officials of the National Socialist Party at the Nazi Party Congress held in Nuremberg last September. At that time, German cabinet members openly attacked the people's front governments of various countries, especially the French people's front government, at the conference. Looking back on the past, it can be seen that German policy has been consistent from beginning to end. In addition, regarding the news claimed by Britain and France that German troops had arrived in Spanish Morocco, the German authorities have not effectively denied it. They have only responded to the details published by the French newspapers with insulting words. The French public has already unanimously expressed shock at the arrival of German troops in Spanish Morocco. Germany's actions are intended to alienate French public opinion, thereby alienating Britain and France, in order to shirk all responsibility for Germany itself. This can be seen from the editor's note issued by the German News Agency regarding the news sent by the Paris correspondent. It says, "Britain is now following France's lead, no different from becoming a vassal of France. What does Britain think?" (Havas dispatch, 11th)

Rebels Consolidate New Positions, Adopting a Step-by-Step Strategy

Avila. A special dispatch from our correspondent. After the fierce battle on the outskirts of Madrid last week, the battle situation was very calm yesterday, with only air force and artillery units slightly active.

Rebel Camp in Casa de Campo. The rebels have been fighting fiercely for seven days. Today, the Moorish troops and fascist troops are making more vigorous efforts to attack Madrid. The rebel front line, which was only a 16-degree arc last week, has now become 120 degrees, occupying an additional 167 square miles. The strategy now adopted is to tighten the siege, which is different from the previous method of fierce attack. It is planned to advance step by step to achieve the final goal. At the same time, the rebels have cut off the main road from Madrid to El Escorial, so that the government troops have to pass through a 75-mile small road to communicate with El Escorial.

### Japanese Anarchist Party's Revolutionary Conspiracy Exposed

News of the Incident in February Two Years Ago Was Only Released Yesterday; The Organization Spread Throughout the Country, Centering on Rural Areas

Nagano. In February of Showa 10 (1935), the Japanese Anarchist Communist Party was investigated by the authorities, and the riot conspiracy of the secret society Rural Youth Association was discovered. The authorities immediately prohibited the publication of this news and made every effort to investigate. As a result, it was found that the organization of this conspiracy, with Nagano Prefecture as the center, reached throughout Japan, namely Nagano, Hokkaido, Tokyo, Osaka, Kanagawa, Yamanashi, Saitama, Chiba, Ibaraki, Aichi, Shizuoka, Yamanashi, Fukushima, Aomori, Yamagata, Akita, Okayama, Yamaguchi, Tokushima, Ehime, and Saga prefectures were its base. 390 party members were investigated by the authorities, and most of them had their preliminary trials completed by the end of last year. On the 11th of this month, the ban was lifted. The secret society of anarchists, the Rural Youth Party, was established in February of Showa 6 (1931) and set up its headquarters at 932 Meguro, Tokyo. The organization of its society was dissolved in September of Showa 7 (1932), but it continued to operate with its spirit as its guiding principle. The anarchist party in the past focused on theoretical struggle, but this group focused its main force on daily struggle, and centered on rural areas, adopting a so-called autonomous decentralized joint organization, that is, using villages in natural terrain as the basic body to carry out autonomous decentralized movements. First, it sought to enrich the interior of a village, and gradually expanded to other villages. In October of Showa 6 (1931), when cocoon prices in Nagano Prefecture fell sharply and the rural areas were extremely poor, it took advantage of the opportunity to sharpen the consciousness of farmers and attempted to carry out an armed riot in order to realize a national violent revolution. However, its plan was discovered in advance and could not be realized. It is heard that the party members went to Shanghai to buy weapons or organized theft gangs to obtain stolen money and were making active preparations step by step. When the authorities conducted an investigation, they gradually discovered a shocking conspiracy, and all members of the prosecutor's office were shocked. (Allied News Agency dispatch, 11th)

### League of Nations Administrative Council Postpones Meeting

In Response to Turkey's Request; League of Nations Personnel Inspect Antioch; Turkish Radicals Demonstrate

[Geneva] Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chairman of the League of Nations Administrative Council and the Chinese Ambassador to France, has today agreed to the request of the French and Turkish governments to postpone the Administrative Council meeting scheduled to be held on the 18th of this month to the 21st of this month. This action is sufficient to indicate that the direct negotiations between France and Turkey regarding the issue of Alexandretta, which are currently underway, may achieve a satisfactory resolution. It is reported that France and Turkey had a dispute over Alexandretta and Antioch in Syria, which caused general concern at the beginning of this month. The French press believed that Turkey would annex the two places by force, and France would not tolerate this. However, according to the latest situation, Turkey does not want to annex the two places, but only advocates allowing them to be independent. Therefore, France solemnly declared that France is willing to listen to the League of Nations' adjudication of this dispute. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

Antioch. The three neutral inspectors sent by the League of Nations Administrative Council (namely Norwegian diplomat Holstet, Dutch colonial senior official Kana, and Swiss army officer Colonel Tevantville) set off this afternoon to the nearby city of Reyhanlı (50 kilometers away). They will meet with representatives of Turks and Arabs at the city hall to listen to their opinions. At that time, more than 300 moderate Turks cheered and paid tribute to the neutral inspectors, and most Arabs echoed them. Before long, many radical Turks gathered, using sticks to beat the Arabs, and a conflict broke out between the two sides, throwing bricks and stones at each other, and even opening up with pistols and shotguns. The son of the chairman of the local city council even seized a rifle carried by a gendarme and joined the Turkish side, but was immediately arrested. During the disturbances, the neutral inspectors witnessed the incident on the balcony of the city hall. A cavalry team rushed to the scene to suppress it, and the demonstrators fled in all directions, and order was restored. During the battle, one Arab died, and two Turks and eleven Arabs were injured to varying degrees. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

### Impending Reopening of Parliament - The Government Encounters Difficulties

Close Air in the Political-Civilian Alliance

[Tokyo] The parliament, after its recess, will reconvene in ten days. The political atmosphere is increasingly tense. Although members of both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties have entered the cabinet, the future of the parliament is not entirely optimistic. This is because both the Seiyukai and Minseito, as well as a faction within the House of Peers, intend to conduct a thorough review of the government's proposed tax increase bill, electricity control bill, extension of compulsory education, and other measures related to national policy control. In particular, the Seiyukai and Minseito seem to be forming a united front against the Hirota Cabinet's foreign policy. Furthermore, in order to restore the credibility of political parties in this parliamentary session, it is expected that the two major parties will maintain close ties and act together. On one hand, the government is working through cabinet members from both parties to seek their understanding. On the other hand, Prime Minister Hirota is visiting the presidents of both parties, and Secretary-General Tanuma is hosting banquets for the executive members of both parties, all in an effort to dispel the somber atmosphere in advance. Judging from the current situation, it will be difficult for the government to overcome the obstacles in the parliament. The fate of many important cases is highly concerning.

### Labor Strikes in the United States

Negotiations in Automobile Industry Break Down; Glimmer of Hope for Resolution in Seamen's Strike

Detroit: Negotiations to resolve the strike in the American automobile industry broke down at the end of the week due to a failure to compromise on the issue of removing workers who are squatting in the factories and refusing to work. Approximately 100,000 people are currently unemployed. General Motors plans to continue closing several factories within days due to material shortages. The company is now willing to negotiate with union representatives as soon as the workers leave the factories, but rejects the union's condition of two people leaving, as accepting it would be tantamount to condoning illegal squatting. (Eleventh Day, Reuters)

[San Francisco] The president of the Shipping Association, White, telegraphed President Roosevelt today, saying that he expects the seamen's strike to end soon, or perhaps even be resolved within a few days. However, union representative Meynekov stated that negotiations for the seamen's strike could break down at any time, and that only ten of the twenty-one agreements are currently being negotiated. If one fails, all efforts will be in vain. (Tenth Day, Kuo Min News Agency)

### Japanese Raise Funds to Promote the Northeast Five-Year Industrial Plan

Political Instability Causes Japanese Capitalists to Invest Cautiously; The Japanese Government Encourages and Guides Capital Flow to the Northeast

Changchun Correspondence: The Northeast Five-Year Industrial Plan, under the direction of the Japanese, requires the mobilization of ample and extremely large funds for all facilities. Although the puppet organization has issued 150 million yuan in bonds, its underwriting institution is solely the puppet Central Bank. According to the Japanese side, the puppet Central Bank lacks a solid foundation and is prone to extreme danger in the event of an accident. Therefore, it is necessary to pay close attention to the puppet organization's future internal debt issuances. The next issue is the foreign debt problem, which is the so-called Japanese investment in the puppet "Manchukuo." The total necessary expenses for the Northeast production increase plan amount to 1.5 billion yuan, and the majority of the funds must be sought from the Japanese domestic financial market. However, Japan's financial situation is affected by the annual accumulation of deficit government bonds, which impacts investment in the Northeast. Even with this constraint, the Japanese financial community is勉强investing in the Northeast, albeit with an extremely cautious attitude, which is more active than in previous years. Therefore, the Japanese are using this point as evidence of the Japanese financial capital's understanding of the puppet organization, and Prime Minister Hirota is recognizing the national policy and encouraging investment in the Northeast, guiding Japanese financial capital towards the "Manchuria," which the Japanese envision will yield great returns in the future. It is not difficult to supply funds of approximately 100 million yuan annually starting this year. However, how to raise the massive 1.5 billion yuan needed for the implementation of the five-year plan is a major question. Therefore, Japanese financiers are facing serious difficulties in developing the Northeast Five-Year Industrial Plan due to the instability of the Northeast's security situation, the fluctuating tensions in the Far East, and the active implementation of a wartime system by Japanese military and political figures in the Northeast. This deters Japanese domestic capitalists from investing in the Northeast. Furthermore, based on the current fate of Japanese domestic industries, there is already a long-standing conflict of interest between Korean industries and Japanese domestic industries, and the appropriate implementation and resolution of industrial controls is a long-standing issue. In addition, some Japanese domestic capitalists regard the Northeast as a colony of Japanese imperialism, only recognizing the sales of their own goods and not recognizing enterprises in "Manchuria." One of the three principles of the Japanese Five-Year Industrial Plan for the Northeast is to prevent border smuggling, encourage exports, and seek to prevent oversupply through production increases as a means of adjustment. All aspects related to the industrial sector will adopt a national management system for the entire industrial sector, and Japan and "Manchukuo" will conclude treaties to restrict industrial control imports and exports in order to achieve technical solutions. In addition, Matsui, the director of the Resources Bureau dispatched by the Japanese government, has completed inspections of Northeast, Korea, and North China and proposed to the Japanese cabinet to establish a Continental Industry Survey Committee. The steps to be taken are to break through all current difficulties, seek close coordination between Japanese officials and civilians, and complete the so-called Northeast Five-Year Industrial Plan.

### Guangdong Province Expands Anti-Smuggling Efforts

Anti-Smuggling Troops in Chao-Shan Increased to Nine Hundred; Various Agencies Also Effectively Coordinate Anti-Smuggling Efforts

Shantou Correspondence: After Guangdong Province strengthened anti-smuggling efforts last year, customs tax revenue increased by more than 1.3 million customs gold yuan starting in October. Zhang Junshong, the director of the Anti-Smuggling Headquarters, decided this spring to divide the entire province into fifty anti-smuggling districts and one hundred inspection checkpoints, distributed in coastal counties. The local anti-smuggling troops were reorganized into regiments, with Zhang concurrently serving as the regimental commander. Below the regimental commander were large, medium, and small squads, and several inspectors were added and assigned to serve in various locations. In the future, matters related to the suppression of opium, salt administration, tungsten ore, and tax inspections by the Finance Department will be handled by the Anti-Smuggling Headquarters to centralize authority. The anti-smuggling draft law decided last year has been submitted to the Generalissimo's Headquarters and the Ministry of Finance for approval and implemented from New Year's Day this year in accordance with the original plan. The Chao-Mei area is of particular concern and attention. Recently, Feng Gaoyi was appointed as the director of the Chao-Mei Opium Suppression and Anti-Smuggling Inspection Office, which works jointly with the provincial water and land anti-smuggling sub-bureaus. Now, the province has sent three large squads of 900 anti-smuggling soldiers to Shantou to establish anti-smuggling sub-checkpoints in various counties, in order to make anti-smuggling work twice as strict as last year. Whenever ships enter the port of Shantou from other locations, the customs dispatches two electric boats to monitor them in rotation, prohibiting small boats from approaching and transporting smuggled goods. If any small boats deliberately approach, the boatmen will be detained and fined, and the small boats will be sawed in half and placed in front of the customs for public display. The customs also effectively coordinates with agencies such as the Agricultural Products Special Tax Bureau, the Salt Police, and the Tungsten Ore Purchasing Office to establish an anti-smuggling network. The water and land anti-smuggling bureaus have added six patrol ships - "Nuli," "Chenggong," "Haiping," "Haikang," "Haiwei," and "Haiwu" - to patrol the coastal areas of Chao-Shan in order to supplement the customs' insufficient strength. As for the private anti-smuggling associations spontaneously organized by Chao-Shan merchants, following New Year's Day, guilds such as the rice industry and the electric transport industry continued to be established, strengthening defenses to prevent the intrusion of smuggled goods. However, the Japanese ruffians are devising various schemes, often asking traitors to impersonate local residents, fraudulently renting civilian houses, and then failing to report to the Public Security Bureau for registration and pay sanitation fees, leading to frequent disputes with landlords. If the anti-smuggling force is sufficient and the private anti-smuggling efforts are strict, the ruffians' schemes will surely be in vain.

### Economic Improvement in Jiangxi Province Last Year

Increased Exports of Crops and Special Products; Rural Purchasing Power Also Increased Slightly Compared to Before

Nanchang Correspondence: Jiangxi is an important agricultural area in the Yangtze River region, with abundant production of crops, rural sideline industries, and handicrafts. However, due to the continuous impact of banditry and natural disasters in recent years, the entire social economy has been almost completely bankrupt. Fortunately, the banditry in various places was suppressed the year before last, and the majority of displaced farmers returned home to make a living. Last year, the weather was favorable, and both the upper and lower halves of the year saw bumper harvests. Grain prices also rebounded sharply, with prices above three yuan in all but the most remote villages. The rural economy improved, and the social economy showed signs of recovery. At the same time, various special products also saw a turnaround in fortune. According to estimates by the industrial and commercial sectors, last year: 1) Porcelain, which had annual sales of 15 million yuan in its heyday, had annual sales of only over 2 million yuan in recent years. Last year, due to the promotion by the authorities and the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, sales soared to 10 million yuan. 2) Lian Shi, Mao Bian, Heng Jiang, and other types of paper also saw sales rebound to over 2 million yuan last year. 3) Although bamboo and wood prices were not very high last year, sales in the Nanjing and Lower Yangtze areas improved compared to the previous year. 4) Tea, such as Ninghong, saw prices increase and sales double last year due to the government's unified control and transportation, and there is hope for restoring international credibility. 5) Rice: Rice prices in Shanghai and Hankou were mostly above eight to ten yuan last year, and exports from this province were extremely enthusiastic. Currently, the authorities are also forming a large-scale transportation and sales company, utilizing the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Guangdong-Han Railways to promote sales to Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces in order to replace Siamese and Annam rice. There is hope for exporting six million bags next year. 6) Hand-woven cloth, which was previously a common rural handicraft, has been squeezed out by machine-woven fabrics and foreign cloth in recent years and is no longer sought after. Rural women are at a loss. Last year, due to the great demand for cloth in rural areas, hand-woven cloth also saw 2 million yuan in business. 7) Due to the legal tender system last year, the exchange rate rose, and various exports benefited greatly. The sales and exports of other products such as tungsten ore, tobacco, and oil were also better than in previous years. Therefore, those engaged in export trade last year all had a slight surplus. Those engaged in import trade, such as cotton yarn, white sugar, piece goods, sugar, kerosene, and hardware, also had profits without losses due to the slight increase in farmers' purchasing power, brisk sales, and rising prices. However, retailers in this city are still facing closures due to high expenses and sharp declines in production. (January 6)

### Taicang

Police Detectives Mistakenly Injure Merchants

Recently, an attempted robbery occurred at the home of Zhou Shugui, a resident of Xianghua Bridge Town. Afterwards, he received a threatening letter from the bandits, agreeing on a meeting place behind the electric lamp factory in Liuhe Town. Zhou, the person in charge, wrote a letter to the Public Security Bureau reporting the incident. Yang Meilin, the director of the bureau, ordered a patrol team and others to rush to the agreed location on the night of the tenth, and placed a paper bag in the area. Police detectives ambushed around the area. Unexpectedly, Yao Fukui, the bookkeeper of the Yihe Cake Shop in the town, was passing by and saw an item left behind and bent over to pick it up. The ambushing police suspected him of being a bandit and surrounded and arrested him. Yao hurriedly tried to escape, and the police detective pulled out a gun and fired, the bullet entering from the left side of his chest, causing him to fall to the ground injured. Residents heard the sound and gathered, recognizing Yao as a normal merchant, and rushed him to Huizhong Hospital for treatment. His life is in danger. After the incident, the public was indignant and immediately held a citizens' meeting and sent a car to Taicang to ask County Magistrate Wen to go to Liu to investigate. As the county magistrate was ill in bed, he sent Secretary Fang and Director Yang to Liu to investigate.

### Kunshan

Murder Case in the Sixth District During Gambling Arrest

Zhang Suizhi, a farmer in Zhouxiang Township, Sixth District of this county, held a gathering for gambling on the sixth of this month to celebrate the wedding of his cousin. The district police officer in charge became aware of this and rushed to arrest Zhang Suizhi and the gambler Zhou Guangquan and sent them to the Zhangpu Second Sub-Bureau for transfer to the county government for handling. However, Zhou Guangquan was beaten and injured during the transfer, so when the court opened on the eighth, Zhou immediately accused police officer Zhou Xialin of causing the injury. The court ordered a supplementary statement for further verification. Unexpectedly, Zhou Guangquan died from his injuries at 3:30 PM on the ninth. The district chief of the mountain district reported to the county for an autopsy. An autopsy revealed a scar on his lower abdomen, which was light red in color, indicating that he may have died from the injury. After inspecting the coffin, it was transported to the Zhenru Forensic Research Institute on the tenth for a second autopsy to ensure thoroughness. Meanwhile, the Public Security Bureau placed the responsible police officer under guard and sent him to the county for interrogation.

### Changshu

Truth Revealed in Bizarre Murder Case in Shazhou

On New Year's Day this year, a bizarre murder case occurred in the Xian surname cemetery in Sansheng Township, Shazhou City. The deceased had seven or eight knife wounds all over his body, and the corpse was burned with fire, blurring his face beyond recognition. After the county government inspected the body, no family members claimed it, leading to a delay of many days. By the evening of the tenth, a friend of the deceased came forward to report the incident. It was revealed that the deceased was named Mao Jinbiao, the squad leader of the Chuangang Security Team in Nantong (this place is at the intersection of Tong and Chang). The person who came forward to report the incident was Mao's subordinate, named Guo Jinkui. Guo, a native of Xuzhou, was a compatriot of Mao. He was once so poor that he had no place to stand, and he was able to join the security team and enlist thanks to Mao's recommendation. After enlisting, the two had a friendly relationship. However, Mao's wife was unfaithful and became acquainted with Liu Longqing of Shang Erweigang, with whom she had frequent contact. Mao himself learned of this and consulted Guo Jinkui about countermeasures, planning to sue the county government. Unexpectedly, the adulterer took advantage of Guo's business trip and, knowing that Mao was outnumbered, devised a plan to kill Mao and burn his body in an attempt to eliminate the traces. Mao's wife then moved in with Liu. When Guo Gongxue returned to Shi Erweigang on the evening of the ninth, he learned that Squad Leader Mao had suddenly disappeared and then learned of the strange corpse in the Qian surname cemetery. He went to investigate in detail and found that the clothing was indeed that of Squad Leader Mao. After various investigations, he learned that Liu Longqing must have committed the crime, so he reported to the district office and sent the police to arrest the murderer. Unexpectedly, Liu had already heard the news and fled far away with the woman, and only his elderly mother, Chen, was arrested at home. She has already been sent to the city. It is expected that this case will soon come to light. According to the previous statements made by the plaintiff Guo Jinkui in court, he said that he was avenging his friend.

### Suzhou

New City Gate to Be Added to Xu Gate

The Suzhou urban area has decided to invest 290,000 yuan this year to carry out major construction, with particular emphasis on widening the streets. The Construction Bureau has proposed to build a new city gate on the side of the Xu Gate, directly facing the Wannian Bridge in the area, due to the curvature of the Xu Gate and the streets, which is not suitable for the development of transportation. This will unify the development of internal and external transportation and commerce, while the old Xu Gate will be preserved without being filled in.

### Wuxi

Prime Culprit in Revenge Killing Case Apprehended

The Fan Hongyu silk and foreign goods store in Guqiao, Beiqiaokou, outside the North Gate of this county, experienced a major revenge killing case in the summer of last year. At that time, Fan Hangen, the small shopkeeper of the store, was shot and killed by thugs. The mistress Fan Zhou, and Fan Xiuqin, two sister-in-laws, were also shot and injured. Fortunately, they were treated quickly and recovered. However, the case remained unsolved for a long time after it occurred. Recently, the store owner Fan Xingbo received a threatening letter from thugs demanding a large sum of money. As Fan could not afford to pay, he had to temporarily take refuge elsewhere and reported to the Public Security Bureau asking for an arrest. At about 2:00 AM on the morning of the eleventh, Zhang Qian, a political police officer from the Public Security Bureau, was inspecting hotels on the road and found a traveler named Pan Renjie (from Bao Ying) suspicious in Room 25 of the Shenjiang Hotel on Tonghui Road. He interrogated him, but his speech was evasive. He was taken to the bureau and placed under strict guard. The person was found to be closely related to the revenge killing case. The bureau ordered Fan Xingbo and Fan Zhou, the parties involved, to come to the bureau to identify him. After examining his appearance, they confirmed that he was indeed one of the main culprits at the scene. According to Pan Renjie's interrogation, his confession was cunning. He only stated that he had previously served as a police officer in the Fifth Sub-Bureau and worked under Ding Lei in the Shanghai Court. The case is still under investigation, and it is heard that the extortionist in this case has also been arrested and is scheduled to be sent to the headquarters for questioning on the eleventh.

### Changzhou

Thugs Rob at Market Opening

Qianqiufang in Wuyi is a bustling market. At about 8:00 PM on the tenth, Huang, the mistress of the Xia Yuheng goods store in the area, put the legal tender subsidiary coins and silver dollars earned from the day's business into her wallet. At that time, a young man of about twenty years of age came to the store in the name of buying cigarettes and snatched Huang's wallet and fled. The report was quickly sent to the First Sub-Bureau of Public Security for pursuit, but the thugs had already fled without a trace.

### Nantong

Female Teacher's Love Letter Involved in Litigation

Chen Zhongfen, a teacher at the Shanghai Women and Children's Middle School, had five love letters found by her husband, Jin Zuren, who suspected that she was having an affair. He filed a lawsuit with the Nantong District Court to divorce his wife. Jin Zuren is employed as the deputy director of the Dasheng Yarn Factory. The plaintiff and defendant are both members of the educated class, and curious men and women are vying to watch the trial. Jin testified in court that he had been married to Chen Zhongfen for three years, but had only lived together for nine days. Chen said that the love letter was written by her same-sex friend Chen Zuiyu. Judge Shao then summoned Chen Zuiyu to verify the handwriting. Chen Zhongfen also defended herself, saying that the reason for not living together was that her husband suffered from gonorrhea. If he could produce a health certificate, there would be no problem.

### The Situation in Xi'an is Gradually Unfolding; Public Groups in Various Cities Yesterday Telegraphically Urged Xi Yu

Please Urge the Central Government Not to Be Overly Lenient in Order to Curb the Seeds of Rebellion; Advise Yang Yu and Others to Prioritize the Nation and the People

The 173 trade associations in this city, including the Banking Association, as well as 63 Shanghai Fellow Provincial Associations from Shaoxing and other places, the Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association, and other groups, yesterday, due to the tense situation in Xi'an, jointly issued the following three key telegrams:

Telegram to the Central Government

Since the Xi'an Incident occurred, the whole country has been indignant. Fortunately, our Central Government handled it appropriately, and inspired by the great personality of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the incident was quickly quelled. The nation and the people are truly fortunate. Zhang Xueliang's act of rebelling against his superiors is an unforgivable crime. However, Chairman Chiang generously pardoned him, and the Central Government granted him amnesty, opening a path for him to reform and atone for his sins by meritorious service. Yang Yu and others requested punishment, which was also leniently considered to show leniency. This was done because at this time of national unification, we should devote ourselves to saving the nation and preserving our strength, and therefore special consideration was given. The Central Government's handling of the aftermath of this incident took into account both legal principles and human sentiments, and was universally admired by the people of the country. Their painstaking efforts to maintain local stability and care for the officers and soldiers were even more admired by the entire country. Unexpectedly, more than two weeks have passed, and we have heard that the troops under Yang and others have not shown any intention of complying with the orders. Could it be that they still do not prioritize the nation and intend to rely on their fortified positions to deploy troops in an attempt to fulfill their wild ambitions? If so, they intentionally destroy unity, provide the enemy with opportunities to invade, and willingly rebel, what more can be said? In order to lay the foundation for saving the nation and resisting foreign aggression, we should ask the Central Government to send troops to suppress them in order to curb the seeds of rebellion. It is the will of the people of the entire country that those who resist orders should be severely punished, which is definitely not comparable to a civil war. Do not be overly lenient, this is what we hope and pray for. The telegram is filled with urgent anticipation for orders.

Warning to Yang Yu

In this Xi'an Incident, you, gentlemen, made a big mistake. Fortunately, our Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, inspired by his great personality, and the Central Government's appropriate handling, quickly quelled the incident, avoiding a major disaster. The region was spared devastation, and the nation's strength was not diminished. However, in order to rectify party discipline and uphold national law, Zhang Xueliang had to be punished. But Chiang Kai-shek, with his benevolent heart, requested and received Central Government approval for a special pardon. Your request for punishment was also leniently considered and not deeply investigated, in order to show leniency. Legal principles and human sentiments were both taken into account, public opinion supported it, and the will of the people was united. How should you, gentlemen, not feel grateful and understand the Central Government's painstaking efforts to protect the region and its officers and soldiers? You should quickly comply with the orders regarding the plans for the rehabilitation of military and political affairs in Shaanxi and Gansu, and atone for your sins by meritorious service. Unexpectedly, two weeks have passed, and we have not seen any real compliance. Could it be that you do not accept even this, and still want to wield your troops and act like a warlord, relying on your fortified positions to resist, and repeat the old drama of warlords? The people of the country all hope for national unity to resist foreign aggression and save the nation. If you, gentlemen, insist on violating the will of the people, in order to lay the foundation for saving the nation and resisting foreign aggression, we have no choice but to petition the Central Government to launch a large-scale attack and severely punish those who resist orders. Where will you, gentlemen, find a place to stand in this world? We earnestly hope that you will prioritize the nation and the people, and strictly comply with the orders as soon as possible, obey the Central Government, and be loyal to the Party and the country, in order to live up to the expectations of the people. We tearfully present our words and await your wise instructions.

Telegram to the Whole Country

To all political and military organs, legal entities, and newspapers across the country: We have just submitted a document to the Central Government (see above, omitted). The national crisis is deepening, and we cannot resist foreign aggression without first pacifying the country. We earnestly hope that everyone will unanimously advocate and sincerely support the Central Government's handling of the rehabilitation of Shaanxi and Gansu. We respectfully present this telegram and await your wise instructions. Shanghai Banking Association, Bamboo Association, Qingyan Association, Garment Association, Fresh Medicine Association, Foreign Bleached Cloth Association, Fresh Pork Association, Sales Association, Woolen Fabric Association, Embroidery Association, Shoe Association, Engraving Association, Chinese Medicine Association, Plush Association, Clock and Watch Association, Qingyou Huagu Association, Native Cloth Association, Rubber Association, Silk Fabric Association, Sand and Gravel Association, Salted Fish Association, Rickshaw Association, Fruit Association, Ham Association, Paint Association, Tea Association, Paint and Woodware Association, Flower and Tree Association, Barber Association, and 173 other trade associations, Shaoxing County, Anhui, Huining, Shangyu, Zhenhai, Binshan, Yuyao, Yangshu, Yancheng, Zhenjiang, Shandong, Ninghai, Ningbo, Fenghua, Wujiang, Haining, Taicang, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and 63 other Shanghai Fellow Provincial Associations, Bingzi Society, Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association, and others respectfully bow.

Security Committee's Advice

The Party Department of the Municipal Security Corps telegraphed yesterday, urging them to adhere to the Central Government in order to safeguard the foundation of the nation. The telegram said: To Director Yang Hucheng of Xi'an and Chairman Yu Xiaohou of Lanzhou: We respectfully read the Central Government's orders regarding Shaanxi and Gansu. The various measures stipulated for military and political affairs are originally intended to preserve the strength of the nation, stabilize local security, cultivate the vitality of the people, and cherish your merits. No long-term plan is better than this. Legal principles and human sentiments are both taken into account. You are pillars of the Party and the country, and mainstays of the nation, and your loyalty to the government has always been evident. We humbly request that you immediately comply with the Central Government's orders to reassure the people and strengthen unity. We respectfully send this telegram with sincerity, and hope that you will understand. The Shanghai Municipal Security Corps Party Affairs Guidance Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang respectfully bows and seals.

### Tan Lianfang Discusses the Resolution of the Sino-French Border Issue

The French Side Has Agreed to Return the Boundary Markers to Their Original Locations; Relations are Quite Good, and There Will Be No Problems in the Future

Tan Lianfang, the Special Commissioner for the Defense of the Guilin-Longzhou Area, arrived in Shanghai yesterday with the Guangxi Domestic Inspection Group. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency paid a special visit to Tan at his temporary residence yesterday to inquire about the recent dispute over the Sino-French Buminquan border area. According to Tan, the Sino-French border in Guangxi Province was initially 910 kilometers long. Boundary markers were originally erected, which were established after the Sino-French War. During the 19th year of the Republic of China, the Communists occupied Guangxi, and the Buminquan area on the border between Guangxi and Vietnam was also occupied. At that time, the people of French Vietnam also suffered casualties. When the Communists were being suppressed, the people of French territory took the opportunity to move boundary marker No. 41 into Guangxi, about 10 kilometers. Afterwards, our side discovered this, and the Sino-French border dispute arose. The result of negotiations between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the French side was that a joint committee was formed by both sides to survey everything. After the survey, the French side has now admitted that the boundary marker was moved and has agreed to voluntarily return the boundary marker to its original location based on geographical and historical facts. Therefore, this Sino-French border dispute has been completely resolved. Tan also said that the current relations between the two countries' peoples on the Sino-French border are quite harmonious. The Guangxi Provincial Government also adheres to the principle of peaceful cooperation and equal coexistence in handling all matters in the border area, so there should be no more disputes in the future.

### British Export Credits Guarantee Department Representative Patrick Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning

His Task is to Continue the Unfinished Work of Sir Arthur Salter; Seeking Avenues for British Investment in China; Establishing British Export Credit Relations with China

Patrick, a representative of the British Export Credits Guarantee Department, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 8:00 am aboard the British India Steam Navigation Company's ship "Rawalpindi," accompanied by his wife and assistant Mr. O'Leary. The details are as follows:

Arrival Details

The ship docked at the Jardine Matheson & Co., Ltd. wharf on East Broadway Road. Those who went to the ship to welcome him included Kong Xiangxi's representative from the Ministry of Finance, Xi Demao and Lin Shiliang, Zhang Jia'ao's representative from the Ministry of Railways, Xia Peng, the British Consul-General Brenan's representative, Mr. Basil, the Commercial Counselor Beal's representative, Mr. Mackinnon, the financial adviser Mr. Hallpatch, and the British adviser to the Central Bank Mr. Rogers. Finance Minister Kong also presented a flower basket. Mr. Patrick exchanged brief greetings with the welcoming party and then went ashore, taking a car to the Cathay Hotel on the Bund to rest. He also sent his assistant Mr. O'Leary to the British Embassy office in the Jardine Matheson Building to arrange everything. He plans to meet with British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen before going to Beijing to pay a visit to our country's authorities.

Spoken Remarks

After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Patrick met with reporters and made a statement. This is my first time coming to China, and I am very pleased. In the future, I plan to visit government authorities and leaders from all walks of life in your country to enhance personal friendship and promote Sino-British trade. This is to continue the unfinished work of Sir Arthur Salter. My task is to represent British exporters, investigate the market situation in your country, and find avenues for British investment. I will prepare a report and submit it to the Advisory Committee on Foreign Trade of the British government. This committee is composed of leaders from the domestic banking and business communities. After they discuss and consider it, they will decide on a plan and submit it to the government. Then, the Export Credits Guarantee Department will introduce it to British merchants and provide them with guarantees to establish export credit relations with China. In short, the British government will provide merchants with guarantees to sell goods to China on credit. This is what banks and merchants of all countries can do, and it is not that the British side wants to monopolize the Chinese market. At this point, a reporter asked Mr. Patrick how much money the UK would lend to China. Mr. Patrick did not give a specific answer, but reiterated that his task was only to investigate and advise, not to negotiate loans. He was also asked whether British merchants could consider the interests of Chinese consumers and reduce prices to increase British exports to China. Mr. Patrick said that since British goods exported to China have not increased in price in recent years, there is no need to consider this matter at present. Finally, Mr. Patrick stated his impressions after arriving in China, saying that China is trending towards stability and progress, just as Sir Arthur Salter and the American Far East Inspection Group said, so this trip is very optimistic. Mr. Patrick will stay for about five or six months and will go to major commercial ports for inspection before returning to his country to report to the government and contact British manufacturers, and then come to China again to continue his work.

Mr. Patrick's Brief Biography

Mr. Patrick is 59 years old and full of vigor. He was born in Bristol in 1878. He first worked at the Oriental Bank Corporation.

Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, and others in this city, in order to develop the industries of Sichuan and Xikang and communicate commerce between Shanghai and Sichuan, have initiated the collection of large amounts of capital to organize the Xichuan Enterprise Co., Ltd., which will be officially opened next month. A reporter has specially compiled the details as follows:

Famous Figures in This City Jointly Initiate

The Xichuan Enterprise Company began preparations in the second half of last year. It was initiated by more than ten giants in the industrial and commercial circles, including Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Weiru, and Zhang Ziquan. It was also supported by Central Committee member Chu Minyi and Commander Yang Hu (Xiaotian), Hubei Finance Director Jia Shiyi, and others. It has collected huge amounts of capital and has now established an office in the Kenyeda Building on Beijing Road in Shanghai to actively prepare. General Manager Zhu Lianfu has made a special trip to Chongqing to prepare and discuss business, and a general branch will be established in Chongqing in the future. Shanghai will establish a general management office to be responsible for hosting everything. The first batch of national products needed in Sichuan has been shipped in advance the day before yesterday.

Introducing National Products for Import into Sichuan

The company's main business goal is to introduce Sichuan specialties to Shanghai and then export them to various places so that Sichuan goods can circulate smoothly throughout the country. At the same time, it will unite with national product manufacturers in Shanghai to transport national products to Sichuan as much as possible. It is currently in contact with various national product manufacturers, and many factories have actively participated in recent days. The manufacturers that have already participated include Deyu Battery Factory, Dahua Iron and Steel Factory, Shanghai Fish Market, China Pencil Factory, Shengde Weaving Factory, Xiang Sheng Embroidery Weaving Factory, Huanan Electrical Appliance Factory, Shuanglun Toothbrush Factory, Guangming Thermos Factory, Meixin Bakelite Factory, Xinhua Glass Factory, and several other companies.

Nationals Establish Their Own Ice Factory in Chongqing

In addition, the company, in view of the transportation of various fresh goods from Shanghai to Sichuan and the lack of refrigeration equipment in Sichuan, which caused a lot of inconvenience, and although there is currently the Yufu Ice Factory established in Chongqing, it is purely operated by foreigners, and the machinery is old (purchased in 1921), so very little ice is produced, and it is not enough to meet the demand. Sichuan merchants feel very distressed. The company has decided to establish a large-scale ice factory in Chongqing. Zhu Lianfu's trip this time included planning the establishment of the ice factory. At the same time, the company has also established contact with the Minsheng Industrial Company. The Minsheng ships all have refrigeration equipment, so the entry of fish market and other fresh goods into Sichuan in the future should not be hindered. It is also learned that Zhu will return to Shanghai in about a month, and at that time, a shareholders' meeting will be convened to elect directors and officially open the company.

### The Trade Union Requests Continued Negotiations on the Inspection of Factories in the Special District

Our local correspondent for the Foreign News Agency reports that the issue of factory inspections in the Special District, which has been virtually stalled for a long time, is currently being petitioned to the municipal government by the Municipal Industrial Federation for continued negotiations. According to the opinions of the industrialists in the association, in order to send out various facilities within the factories, there should be this main inspection agency in the Special District. The municipal government should not delay the decision due to the excuse of consular jurisdiction by the Concession authorities. Furthermore, in view of the frequent occurrence of accidents in the factories within the Concession, it is necessary to resolve them quickly so that various factories can be subject to appropriate and necessary supervision. Last week, this newspaper learned from the General Manager, Mr. Fessenden, that he had submitted other solutions to the Secretary-General of the municipal government, Yu Hongjun, regarding future methods, but Mr. Fessenden refused to disclose the content, only saying that it was just a tentative opinion. However, as far as this newspaper (the Continental Daily) knows, he still insists on the original proposal that the Municipal Council should draft its regulations for factory inspections within the Concession based on the Central Government's Factory Law. Currently, this suggestion is still being studied in detail by the Ministry of Industry, and the municipal government denies the rumor that the Ministry of Industry has agreed to it and specifically ordered Secretary-General Yu to continue negotiations. Mr. Fessenden's proposal to submit this compromise suggestion is intended to eliminate the obstacles caused by the dispute over extraterritoriality, which has led to the overturning of the draft agreement negotiated for five years. Fessenden hopes that the Municipal Council will draft the Municipal Council's regulations based on the Factory Law to remove the opposition from the consular corps due to the damage to the treaty and treaty interests, it is said.

### The Match Production and Sales Cooperative Society Hospitably Received Chinese and Foreign Journalists Yesterday

During the banquet, Liu, Xu, and others reported on the progress of the preparations, which is recorded below:

Speech by Liu Hongsheng

Mr. Liu said in his speech, "Thank you all for gracing us with your presence today, giving us an opportunity to gather in the New Year. I am truly grateful.

Now that this matter has made considerable progress, we will first take this opportunity to invite our Managing Director to give you a brief report. After the report, please enjoy a few more drinks. However, please forgive any shortcomings in our hospitality. Now, I would like to propose a toast to everyone here, wishing you progress in the New Year and all the best." After finishing his speech, it was translated into Japanese.

Report by Xu Zhiyi

Mr. Xu then reported, "The match industry is facing an obvious fact that it cannot survive due to overproduction, which needs no further elaboration. The purpose of this cooperative is to collaborate with each other to achieve common survival and prosperity. All the society's articles of association and relief plans have been submitted to the government for approval and have been ordered to all regions within five years, not to add new factories, in order to safeguard. Since being approved to prepare in March last year, it has not been established early due to the complexity of the situation. Now, it has gradually begun to take shape and will be opened on time.

Yan Rangxue, the leader of the Korean New Korea Independence Party, after the so-called Manse Incident occurred in the Japanese Taisho Year 9 (1920), fled to the Northeast due to serious searches by Japanese officials, and then came to Shanghai to organize the Korean Provisional Government. In Showa Year 8 (1933), he organized the Korean Revolutionary Party, and the following year he served as the executive committee member of the New Korea Independence Party, and had relations with the Korean National Revolutionary Party and the Kuomintang. Recently, due to the relationship of raising funds for the independence movement, he was detected by the police of the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, and then at six o'clock yesterday morning, he and the authorities of the French Bureau of Works arrested him at the Ping'an Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, and escorted him to the police station of the Japanese Consulate General. He is now being seriously interrogated by the Japanese side.

### Economic Expert Jin Guobao Discusses Special Cash Guarantee Methods

Believes That All Parties Concerned Benefit

Since the report stated that Mr. Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Shanghai Banking Association, reported that he decided to implement a special cash guarantee method, people from all walks of life regarded this matter as a major reform of the banking personnel system, so they all paid close attention to it, and it was heard that one or two banks are about to implement it. The reporter specially visited the economic expert and specialist member of the Central Bank, Mr. Jin Guobao, and he promised to publish his conversation as follows:

The Guarantor System is Unscientific

Bank employees are mostly in contact with coins and securities all day long due to their duties. In order to prevent embezzlement and fraud, banks must make them provide reliable guarantees. In the past, due to customs, those who acted as guarantors for employees were mostly people with considerable reputation in society. However, the number of such people is small, while the number of people seeking guarantors in society is extremely large. Therefore, each person with considerable reputation often acts as a guarantor for dozens or hundreds of people. The individual's financial resources are limited, and it is natural that the result of using limited financial resources to provide unlimited guarantees for a large number of people cannot be satisfactory. In recent years, banks have mostly used public examinations to recruit personnel in order to select true talents. The people who are admitted are not protected by power and influence, so it is not easy to obtain people with status to act as their guarantors. Therefore, they often have excellent knowledge but are ultimately rejected because they cannot obtain suitable guarantors.

Five Major Principles of Cash Guarantee

The above only lists the major points, which can already give a general idea. The individual guarantee method is not only a burden on employees and a mistake for the bank, but also unfavorable to the guarantor. It is urgent to reform it. However, although people in the banking industry have had such feelings in the past, there is no proper improvement, so they have not been able to resolve the above difficulties. In today's European and American countries, this system has long been eliminated. The credit insurance they practice is extremely expensive and not entirely applicable to the situation in our country. Recently, it has been heard that a large bank in this port initiated a special cash guarantee method. The content is to adopt the British and American banking system, refer to the situation in our country and formulate it. It is composed of five principles: A, B, and C guarantee deposits, joint punishment, and rewards for whistleblowing. It is stipulated that when an employee joins, they must pay an A guarantee deposit equal to three days' salary. (The item certificate is fully recovered when leaving the industry, and interest can still be obtained by storing it in the line. Afterwards, 2% of the B guarantee deposit is deducted from the salary or savings every month, and the line allocates a certain amount of the C guarantee deposit every year. Half of the interest on the A guarantee deposit (the interest is specially increased, so as to avoid the certificate being shelved), and the B and C guarantee deposits are combined into a huge amount as a public reserve fund, so as to compensate for the embezzlement of employees and the employee's certificate. When the money and all other property are not enough to compensate, make up for it with this. The nature of the B certificate deposit is similar to the premium for credit insurance, but it can still be returned if no fraud occurs. This is determined by the physical employee and the employee's personal relationship, and it has a more positive effect than paying the premium and not being able to return it. It is in insurance, the intention of saving is better than credit insurance, the above three items are focused on consolidating the compensation after the event. Preventing fraud is still not very effective, so it is stipulated that joint punishment and rewards for whistleblowing will curb the motivation for fraud. Later, there will be money for the employee welfare business from the huge amount of reserve funds, so as to help the progress of personnel management.

Group Combination to Prevent Problems Before They Happen

We can see that the above provisions have a close relationship, and the joint punishment and the return of the B guarantee deposit are especially meaningful. The entire method is meticulously planned, eliminating personal interest concepts, thinking from the interests of the entire group, in line with the spirit of modern group combination, and paying special attention to prevention in advance. In addition to the original mechanical supervision in handling affairs, it can also promote spiritual unity and cooperation to achieve the prevention of fraud. It can be asserted that it will have a great effect. It has been heard that this method has been proposed for more than two years, and it has been revised seven times. The original proposers have repeatedly consulted various opinions, researched and revised, and have reached perfection. After implementation, employees can be relieved of the difficulty of finding a guarantee. On the bank's side, if there is a fraud incident, there will be evidence to compensate, so it will not be as time-consuming and fruitless as in the past. It also makes ordinary guarantors no longer suffer from trouble in the future, which is beneficial to all parties. As for employees who have just joined the industry, it is not easy to raise the certificate money of three months' salary for those from poor families, but the amount is limited, which is much easier than asking someone to act as a guarantor. Therefore, cash guarantee is the only way to relieve employees' pain.

The Authorities Approve Implementation Within the Month

Since the method was proposed, Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry has been quite supportive. Economic expert and Chairman of the Legislative Yuan, Dr. Ma Yinchu, has made a statement on this, believing it is feasible, and hoping that the banking authorities will pay attention to it. Recently, the Banking Association responded to the Banking Association's request for assistance and has repeatedly studied it and sent letters to the national financial community to jointly study the opinions expressed by all parties, which is very agreeable. It is also learned that Dr. Li Quanshi, the chief writer of the economic expert bank weekly, has written a "Questions and Answers" article to explain it in detail. This is enough to see the enthusiasm of all parties' support and the high expectations. It is now heard that the Banking Association is planning to implement the method after careful research in order to speed up the improvement of the guarantee system. Various banks will also follow suit. It is heard that one or two banks are about to implement it, which is a pioneer in the trend. This kind of reform and creative spirit is especially admired. It is seen that the difficulty of the guarantee problem felt by the banking industry for decades can be resolved. In the past, various undertakings in our country were mostly conservative and lacked creative spirit. It is heard that this method has been publicly studied by various leaders in the banking industry, and they all expressed their deep approval, which is enough to prove that the method is proper, perfect and undoubtedly different. It is seen that one line proposes it, and all lines follow suit. The future outlook is becoming brighter, which is not only a blessing for our banking industry, but also a blessing for the entire society.

### Sharp Drop in Yen Exchange Rate in Shanghai After Japanese Government Controls Foreign Exchange

Japanese Businesses Try Their Best to Maintain It, But It Is Impossible to Stabilize for a While

Since the Japanese government controlled foreign exchange, yen exchange transactions in Shanghai suddenly became chaotic. Fortunately, Japanese commercial banks purchased a large amount of it to maintain it. Yesterday, the Central Bank quoted 103 yuan of Japanese gold as equivalent to 100 yuan of national currency, and the British HSBC Bank quoted 102 yuan and 62.5 cents of Japanese gold as equivalent to 100 yuan of national currency. However, according to investigations, the above quotation is not the actual market price. The actual transaction is 104 yuan and 50 cents of Japanese gold, which is equivalent to 100 yuan of national currency. It seems that it is not easy to stabilize for a while. However, it is heard that the Central Bank purchased 1-2 million yuan of Japanese gold last Saturday.

### British Businesses Exported a Total of 800 Quintals of Silkworm Cocoons

Shipped to Britain, Italy, and France to Produce 85 High-Grade Raw Silk

After British companies such as Jardine Matheson & Co. shipped high-quality dried cocoons from our country by ship to Italy, Britain, France, and other countries, the silk industry trade unions in various districts of Shanghai petitioned the government to quickly stop them in order to maintain the livelihood of workers. The silk factory industry association also asked the government to find ways to prevent it in order to avoid affecting the export of raw silk and maintaining the livelihood of tens of thousands of workers. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the relevant parties yesterday that the total amount of cocoons exported by Jardine Matheson and other foreign companies was about 800 quintals, which were shipped to various places in Britain, Italy, and France, and none were shipped to Japan. This high-quality dried cocoon is used to manufacture 13 to 15-line 85-point Ivenas high-grade raw silk. The price is about 950 yuan in Chinese currency per dan. Because our country's silk reeling machines are difficult to manufacture the above-mentioned raw silk.

### County Government Cables to Make Efforts to Prohibit Opium and Conduct a General Re-Examination

Report on the Handling Situation Every Three Days

Since the start of the general re-examination of opium and drug prohibition in Shanghai County, all staff members have been dispatched.

We hope that you will especially promote and supervise the handling seriously. We also hope that you will report on the handling situation once every three days for our reference and transfer. This is a special item and must not be delayed, please." County Magistrate Li Zhifu, with the official seal.

### Agreement Reached on the Amount of Withholding for Income Tax on Deposit Interest

4% Paid to the Ministry of Finance, 1% Commission for Banks

After the Ministry of Finance announced that it would continue to levy various types of income tax from New Year's Day, the Shanghai Banking Industry Association has notified its members to comply. However, due to the complicated withholding procedures for deposit income tax, the joint meeting of the two industries decided to send Lin Kanghou and Cai Chengxin as representatives to contact the Shanghai Office of Income Tax of the Ministry of Finance for withholding procedures. According to the reporter's inquiry yesterday, Mr. Lin and Mr. Cai have reached an agreement with Mr. Liang Jingchun, Director of the Income Tax Office, on the amount of withholding for deposit interest income tax. The income withheld by banks and other institutions is 4% to be paid to the Ministry of Finance, and 1% is to be used as funds for the banks and other institutions. Other procedures need to be discussed again.

### Charity Groups Allocate Funds to Huicui and Continue to Solicit Donations from All Walks of Life

The United Relief Association of Charity Organizations in this city received a telegram from Standing Committee Members Feng and Yang, reporting the serious disaster situation in Suiyuan and the extreme suffering of the victims. In addition to allocating 20,000 yuan to Huicui for disaster relief, it also continued to send letters to solicit donations from all walks of life. The association received a telegram from Feng and Yang and the Suiyuan Provincial Disaster Relief Association yesterday, stating: ㊀ (Title omitted) The Relief Committee transferred over 10,000 yuan of relief money on its behalf, which has been received in full. This place is bitterly cold, and the disaster situation is serious. The people in the war zone are dying more and more without clothes and food. The previous money is far from enough. We still hope to continue raising and transferring money to provide continuous relief and expand disaster relief.

The colleagues of this association are extremely grateful for the news and would like to express our sincere gratitude on behalf of the tens of thousands of victims in the eastern and northern Sui war zones. It is the middle of winter, and the victims are exposed and hungry. Relief is extremely urgent, and we beg for your quick assistance. Zhen Yin of the Suiyuan Provincial Disaster Relief Association.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Opens Overseas Routes

Haiyuan Steamer Sails on the Xiamen-Luzon Route

Since the Si Xin Steamer of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company opened the Nanhua route, its business has been good and its cargo and passengers have been crowded, surpassing the foreign merchant ships on the same route. In recent years, the overseas Chinese in various parts of Southeast Asia have requested the company to add overseas shipping routes to facilitate the travel of overseas Chinese. Letters and telegrams have been pouring in. Last year, the company decided to open new routes in Southeast Asia. At that time, General Manager Cai submitted it to the Ministry of Communications and immediately dispatched Zeng Guangqing, director of the business department of the bureau, to personally inspect various ports in Southeast Asia to prepare for adding new overseas routes. It was scheduled for February, and it was also planned to purchase several new sea ships suitable for sailing in Southeast Asia in Hong Kong and other places. The business department temporarily replaced An Laomian, and a notice has been issued, and the bureau members have also held a farewell party for Guangqing. Later, because the Ministry of Communications advocated building new ships and did not want to buy old ships again, the matter was shelved. Afterwards, the Southeast Asian Commercial Inspection Group returned to China, and in view of the overseas Chinese's ardent hope that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company would quickly open Southeast Asian routes to facilitate the travel of overseas Chinese and recover the overflowing rights and interests, the overseas Chinese in various places were willing to support it with all their strength. They provided opinions and conveyed them to the bureau, requesting immediate implementation. Because the bureau did not have many ships, it was temporarily difficult to open new routes to Singapore and other ports in Southeast Asia. However, in view of the large number of overseas Chinese in Little Luzon Port, and the fact that many overseas Chinese from Guangdong and Fujian were doing business in various parts of the Philippines, hundreds of thousands to millions of people travel there every year, all of whom board ships in Xiamen. The British Taikoo Company has the Anqing Steamer on this route, and Jardine Matheson also has a special route. The prosperity of the business and the crowding of passengers have made the most profit every year. Each ship carries more than a thousand overseas Chinese on each round trip, and the cargo is also crowded. After consideration, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company decided to open the route from Xiamen to Little Luzon first as a prelude to expanding overseas routes. The planning has been going on for many months, and the business department has been in contact with the Xiamen branch and various circles of overseas Chinese in Manila to carry out the project. A management office has been set up in Little Luzon to be responsible for soliciting passengers and receiving cargo. So far, it has been successful. The bureau has reported the preparation situation to the Ministry of Communications for instructions. A reply has now been received from the ministry, approving the opening of the route from Xiamen to Little Luzon first. However, due to the limited number of ships allocated, it was decided after discussion to assign the Haiyuan Steamer of the new Si Hai Steamers to sail on this newly created overseas route. The route starts from Xiamen and ends at Little Luzon, sailing back and forth. One ship is temporarily assigned to this route, which is mainly for passenger transport. The Haiyuan Steamer has 14 special-class rooms, 18 first-class rooms, 40 second-class rooms, 56 third-class rooms with berths, and 600 third-class rooms without berths. The steerage (that is, fourth-class passenger seats) can accommodate hundreds of people. The ship is new, fast, and suitable for sailing on this new overseas route. Because it has been approved by the ministry, it has been preparing for the opening procedures for days and is very active in preparing. It will probably be officially opened on February 1st. If it is temporarily impossible, it will be delayed for a few days, but it will be opened within a month at the latest. This is indeed a good phenomenon in our country's shipping industry, and it is also good news for the overseas Chinese in Manila.

### Crowds Visit the Municipal Museum

Open Every Day Except Tuesdays. Items Will Be Replaced Within a Short Period of Time

The grand opening of the Shanghai Municipal Museum the day before yesterday has been recorded in previous newspapers. Yesterday, Chinese and foreign people continued to visit in an endless stream, and it was especially crowded in the afternoon. Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs accompanied his wife and Director Li of the First Department of the Municipal Government to visit. Most of the visitors concentrated and studied carefully, and were unwilling to just take a quick look. The exhibits in the museum are mostly of historical significance or artistic beauty, which aroused the interest of the audience. It is heard that after the news of the scheduled opening of the museum was announced, major middle schools and various associations sent letters to order group tickets. Primary schools also have Municipal Xicheng and private Minfu and Jun'an schools that went to ask for permission certificates. The museum has scheduled the visiting dates to avoid crowding. Many cultural institutions in various places also sent telegrams to congratulate them. It is heard that in order to arouse the interest of the audience, the museum plans to replace the exhibits within a short period of time and hold special exhibitions. Also, the museum stops selling tickets at 4 pm every day, so visitors who go to visit in the afternoon must arrive at the museum before 4 pm at the latest to avoid traveling long distances in vain. Tuesdays every month are the museum's regular holidays, so it is closed today. It is open every other day of the year.

### Dredging Bureau Adds Newly Built Dredger with Imposing Hull, Unrivaled in the World

With a hull length reaching 400 feet, British, German, and Dutch ship merchants compete to submit bids, and dredging of the Shintang sandbar proceeds extremely smoothly.

The Shanghai Dredging Bureau, in order to dredge the Shintang sandbar outside the Wusongkou, ordered a giant dredger named "Jianshe" from the German company, Denggao, which arrived in Shanghai in April of the year before last and began the dredging project. Details have been previously reported. Yesterday, the reporter visited the bureau's chief engineer, Dr. Chadley, who provided detailed information about the ordering of the new ship and the recent progress of the dredging work. The details are recorded below:

Shintang Dredging Proceeds Exceptionally Smoothly

Yesterday, the reporter visited the bureau's chief engineer, Chadley, to inquire about the recent dredging of Shintang. According to Chadley, the dredging project of Shintang began in May of the year before last, after the giant dredger "Jianshe" arrived in Shanghai from Germany. As of now, 7 million cubic yards of mud have been dredged. According to the original plan, "Jianshe" can dredge approximately 5 million cubic yards of mud per year at Shintang. The actual amount has exceeded the aforementioned quantity, so the progress of the project can be considered smooth.

Seven Foreign Merchants Bid for the New Ship

The reporter further inquired whether the contractor for the second large dredger had been determined since the invitation for bids was announced. According to Chadley, since the invitation for bids for the first large dredger was announced last year, seven bids have been received, including three from British merchants, two from Dutch ship merchants, and two from German ship merchants. However, which company will be the contractor has not yet been determined. However, the German Xue Gao Company (i.e., the contractor for the previous "Jianshe") is considered to have a higher chance.

Imposing Ship Type Exceeds "Jianshe"

The reporter further asked Chadley whether the new ship's construction plan and its work efficiency would be greater and higher than that of "Jianshe". According to his reply, the length of the new ship exceeds that of "Jianshe" by 40 feet (the length of "Jianshe" is 360 feet), and the width exceeds that of "Jianshe" by 2.5 feet (the width of "Jianshe" is 60 feet). The amount of mud dredged per hour is similar to that of "Jianshe", approximately 2,500 cubic yards, but the mud suction power is even greater than that of "Jianshe".

Dredging Efficiency Surpasses the World

The reporter asked Chadley whether the new ship's design even surpasses that of the "Jianshe", which was already known as the world's largest dredger when it was built in Germany, and whether it is indeed enough to be the best in the world. Chadley replied that there are two dredgers in the world that are longer than "Jianshe", and one that is about the same length as "Jianshe". As for the new ship under construction, there is also one that is longer, which is used by the British for sand suction work in Liverpool, and its length reaches 460 feet. However, its ship type and mechanism are old-fashioned, and its suction power is far less than that of the new ship specially built by our bureau. Therefore, in terms of dredging power, it can indeed hold the crown of the world's dredgers.

### Rent Arrears Case: Lawyer Falsely Accused

Zhang Jinrong, a native of Huaicheng, Jiangbei, residing at No. 29 Gonghe Road, Zhabei, owed the landlord, Shengsheng Company, 346 yuan in rent. Shengsheng Company entrusted its annual legal counsel, Lawyer Xuan Zhendong, to sue for recovery. After the final judgment, Zhang instructed Chen Jianqiu to request monthly payments from Lawyer Xuan. Lawyer Xuan refused, so he requested the execution court of the local court to execute the judgment. Zhang Jinrong then accused Xuan Zhendong at the Procuratorate of the local court of inviting Chen Jianqiu to his law firm, persuading him to pay 30 yuan to settle the case and guaranteeing that it would not be executed and that there was no need to appeal. He believed this to be true and paid 30 yuan on the afternoon of September 27. Unexpectedly, on the morning of December 8, at 9:00 AM, the execution court executed the judgment for payment. Therefore, Lawyer Xuan was accused of promising money and breaking his promise. Yesterday, Prosecutor Tang summoned a court hearing. Xuan Zhendong declared that he was completely framed. After studying the situation, the interrogator pointed out that ㊀ how could 30 yuan settle a rent debt of 300 yuan, and ㊁ lawsuits involving less than 500 yuan cannot be appealed in the third instance. There was no reason for Xuan Zhendong to deceive him that there was no need to appeal and to request reconciliation. Moreover, there was no evidence to support the accusation. It was obvious that Zhang Jinrong was fabricating facts out of resentment for being sued. He was immediately denounced in court, and the plaintiff, Zhang Jinrong, was transformed into a defendant. He was ordered to be detained for further interrogation after posting bail.

### Capsized Civilian Ship Outside Wusongkou

Yesterday, various shipping companies received a notice from the Jianghai Customs Marine Police, stating that a capsized civilian ship outside Wusongkou was obstructing navigation and ordering them to pay attention. The notice stated that they had received a wireless report from the Nanchang steamer at 4:00 PM on the 9th of this month, stating that they had seen a capsized civilian ship obstructing navigation at 123 degrees east longitude and 33 degrees 36 minutes north latitude.

### Hydrographic Office Plans to Enhance Navigation Safety

Navigators Discover Obstacles and Damaged Markers, Hoping for Prompt Notification or Wireless Transmission

The Shanghai Hydrographic Office issued its first proclamation of the year yesterday, which is extremely important. It is recorded below. Regarding the proclamation, the bureau handles hydrographic surveys and publishes all important events related to navigation. All published charts and books are compiled based on the latest surveys and reports. However, the rivers and waterways are constantly changing, and shipwrecks occur from time to time. In order to enhance navigation safety, it is hoped that navigators will notify the bureau of any events that require correction of the published hydrographic charts and books. In particular, it is hoped that they will promptly notify the bureau of any newly discovered navigation obstacles and changes or damages to navigation markers, so that navigation announcements can be published to inform the public. If there is an urgent message that needs to be transmitted to the bureau by wireless, it can be transmitted through the following two radio stations. This proclamation is hereby issued. The stations are: Shanghai Coast Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications, "Location" 121 degrees 27 minutes 41 seconds east longitude, 31 degrees 13 minutes 10 seconds north latitude, "Call Sign" XSC, "Wavelength" 750 meters (400 kHz), 705 meters (425.5 kHz), 650 meters (461.5 kHz), 630 meters (476.1 kHz), 605 meters (495.8 kHz), 600 meters (500 kHz), 48 meters (6250 kHz), 36 meters (8333.3 kHz). Wusong Radio Station of the National Coast Guard of the Naval Department, "Location" 121 degrees 31 minutes 8 seconds east longitude, 31 degrees 25 minutes 5 seconds north latitude, "Call Sign" XPG, "Wavelength" 48 meters (6250 kHz), 108 meters (2777 kHz). Hydrographic Office of the Naval Department, Republic of China, January 1937.

### Three Organizations Deny Holding Meetings in Borrowed Rooms

Shen Junru and Others Claim to Have Held Meetings in Shanghai; Jiangsu High Court Sends Letter to Second Branch of High Court for Investigation

Shen Junru, Li Gongpu, Zhang Naiqi, Zou Taofen, Wang Zaoshi, Sha Qianli, and female lawyer Shi Liang, among other seven people, were arrested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau in conjunction with the British and French Concession police for suspected reactionary activities, and have been sent to the Procuratorate of the Suzhou High Court for investigation. It is learned that the Procuratorate of the Suzhou High Court stated that, according to Shen and others, on November 12th of last year, the birthday of the Premier, meetings were held in Shanghai at the Youth Association, the Young Women's Christian Association, and the Ningbo Native Place Association. Therefore, a letter was sent to the Second Branch of the High Court, requesting an investigation into whether the statements made by Shen and others were true. The Second Branch of the High Court summoned Xu Yi, Zhang Zhixue, and Dong Qinxiang, the managers of the three associations, to court on Saturday morning. Judge Nie presided over the interrogation. According to Xu Yi, the Youth Association has never had an auditorium, and no one held a meeting there that day. All the rooms in the association were already occupied by residents. If a small number of people held a small group meeting in the room, the manager would not be able to know. According to Zhang Zhixue, he had previously received a letter from Shen Junru, requesting to borrow the auditorium of the Young Women's Christian Association for a meeting on November 12th. He contacted the Public Works Department to inquire, and the request was rejected because it was not approved by the Public Works Department. However, when the date arrived, a crowd gathered. Because the association did not allow the auditorium to be borrowed, they gathered in the open square. It happened to be a holiday that day, and only Western staff members were present in the association. They did not recognize whether Shen Junru and others were among the crowd, and the crowd dispersed soon after.

### One Hundred and Twenty Yuan Can Become Twelve Thousand Yuan

It Turns Out to Be a Bag of Waste Paper; Yuan Yongfu Tricks a Child

Yuan Yongfu, a native of Ningbo, 31 years old, has been setting up a fortune-telling stall at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Ningbo Road, specializing in using flowery words to swindle people's money. Li Minghua, a young owner of Huaming Watch Shop at No. 589 Zhejiang Road, a native of Ningbo (15 years old, residing at No. 140 Xiamen Road, who used to study at Jinwei Primary School nearby and had to pass by Yuan's stall every day), saw that Yuan was always performing various magical arts and felt very curious. He approached him. Yuan learned that Li's family was well-off and used clever words to say that he had a kind of magic that could double each yuan of legal tender into one hundred yuan. Li was moved by his words and took 120 yuan of legal tender from the crowd and gave it to Yuan. Yuan then put it into a yellow cloth bag and took another yellow bag with a statue of a deity, instructing Li to hold it in his left and right hands and ordering him to close his eyes tightly. Li did as he was told. Yuan then took out a package of powder and ordered Li to smell it. He only felt a strange smell, and the child felt slightly dizzy. Then he woke up. Yuan then ordered the child to go home quickly, saying that the 120 yuan of legal tender in the bag had turned into 12,000 yuan, but he insisted that he must not open it halfway, otherwise he would be punished by the gods. Li believed it to be true and rushed home to open the bag, only to find that the legal tender stored in the bag had all turned into waste paper. He knew that he had been cheated and told his mother, Li Bao, who reported it to the Zhabei Police Station. Detective Wang Shanshi was ordered to arrest the suspect, Yuan, but he had already fled. It was not until recently that he was arrested at the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Baike Road. Yuan was dressed in neat clothes. He was taken back to the police station. It was learned that after Yuan defrauded the 120 yuan, most of the stolen money was taken away by a famous Little Hubei. The money he obtained was used to buy clothes, watches, and other items. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Jingyi Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted him for fraud under Article 340 of the Criminal Law. Yuan Yongfu pleaded guilty, saying that when the plaintiff closed his eyes, he immediately replaced the bag (i.e., the one with waste paper) with the bag containing the legal tender. After verifying the confession, Judge Feng Shide sentenced Yuan Yongfu to 10 months in prison. The clothes and other items purchased with the stolen money were returned to the plaintiff.

### Carrying Handguns and Handcuffs, Impersonating Detectives for Extortion

Chen Xize, a Shandong native residing at 52 Chashi Street, French Concession, fled to Vladivostok after being suspected of drug trafficking. Now that the situation has calmed down, he returned to Shanghai a month ago. A Hebei native, Mr. Sun, who had previously worked as a bodyguard for a certain celebrity, learned of this and colluded with Wang Qigui, a Jiangbei native who was a secret agent number 618 at the Mailan Police Station, and Ling Changsheng, a Tianjin native who had been dismissed as a Chinese constable. On the night of the 2nd of this month, they wore Zhongshan suits, carried handguns and handcuffs, and fake documents, etc., impersonating detectives. They went to Chen Xize's house and extorted money on the pretext of searching for drugs. Chen happened to be out, and only Chen's wife was at home. Wang and Ling entered the room and saw Chen's wife lying on a couch, indulging in opium. They arrested Chen's wife and used extortion tactics. As a result, the landlord surnamed Wang repeatedly pleaded for leniency, and they agreed to settle the matter for 100 yuan. They paid 20 yuan in cash at the time, and the remaining 80 yuan was scheduled to be paid the next day. Wang and Ling pretended to agree to release Chen's wife, received the money, and left. Later, Chen returned home and learned of the incident. He had to wait until the next day when they came to collect the money and report it to the police station. When Wang and Ling arrived on time to collect the money, they saw that Chen Xize looked ominous and immediately turned around and fled. Chen also chased them to the entrance of Chashi Street, where the patrol officer at post number 89 intercepted Wang and Ling. Sun took the opportunity to escape. Wang and Ling were taken to the police station and sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Peng from the First Criminal Court questioned them. Attorney Gu Shouxi of the Police Department explained the case and prosecuted the two defendants for the crime of intimidation.

After verifying the confessions in court, the court declared the proceedings concluded and scheduled the sentence for the 16th. The defendants were returned to custody.

### Water Patrol Team Recovers Robbed Cargo Ship

Loot Untouched

Sun Shaokang, a native of Sijing, owns cargo ship No. 3563, which has a municipal license and specializes in transporting goods from the interior to Shanghai for delivery to various merchants. He hired three fellow villagers, Mao Zirong, Zhou Aji, and Yang Gensheng, as crew members. On the 9th of this month, they loaded 30 bundles of white rice and 130 baskets of duck eggs in Sijing and transported them to Shanghai, which were goods of Xie Ji Run and Yixing Gong merchants in Caishi Street, French Concession. Unexpectedly, at 4:00 AM yesterday morning, the ship arrived at the dock of the Tiansheng Pottery Factory behind the Longhua Port. While resting, a large number of bandits, more than ten, suddenly came and crowded onto the ship. They all held knives and guns and spoke in the Jiangbei dialect, threatening them not to make a sound. They tied up all the crew members with ropes, stuffed cotton in their mouths, and carried them onto a boat that the bandits had prepared in advance. They then robbed the cargo ship and sailed away. After the crew members managed to untie themselves, they urgently reported to Kong Zhaorong, the captain of the Third Squadron of the Water Patrol Brigade of the Municipal Police Bureau, for investigation and arrest. They reported to Wei Jizhong, the chief of the brigade, who dispatched Inspector Pan Xutong and Police Chief Liu Xianzhang to drive patrol boats and search diligently in different directions. As a result, at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the water patrol officers and police discovered the robbed cargo ship in the Dinghai Port area of the Yangshupu fish market. All the rice and eggs were untouched. It is thought that the bandits must have gone ashore to contact people for selling the stolen goods. The ship was towed back to the team, and the shipowner was notified to come and claim it. A report was also submitted to the Police Headquarters to issue an order to arrest the fleeing bandits and bring them to justice.

### Mother and Daughter Poisoned by Coal Stove for Heating

Kongshi and her daughter Guiying (8 years old) live in the loft of the house. Last night, when they went to bed, they put a coal ball stove in front of the bed for heating because the weather was cold. At around 8:00 AM this morning, the second landlord of the house saw that Kongshi and her daughter had not yet gotten up and became suspicious. He knocked on their door, but there was no response. He then asked someone to pry open the door and saw Kongshi and her daughter lying in bed, barely breathing. A coal stove was placed in front of the bed. Knowing that they had been poisoned, he quickly carried Kongshi and her daughter to the hospital for treatment. It is said that the poisoning was very serious, and their lives are in danger.

### China Merchants Bureau Announces Replacement of South Wharf Contractor

Regarding the replacement of the South Wharf carrying contractor, the state-owned China Merchants Bureau issued a statement yesterday, stating that the Bureau's dispatching of carrying labor system is one aspect of rectifying wharf affairs. Therefore, in August of last year, the carrying labor for each wharf was publicly tendered to seek fundamental reform. When the South Wharf carrying labor tender results were announced, Li Huanxin was selected as the winning bidder. A contract was immediately signed and handed over for undertaking, hoping that Li Huanxin could fulfill the contract terms, so that the loading and unloading matters of the wharf could gradually become perfect. Unexpectedly, after Li took over, there were frequent incidents of deducting workers' wages and demanding money from merchants. The Bureau has received multiple reports from various responsible parties and complaints. Moreover, Li Huanxin's ability is weak, and he is not good at managing loading and unloading, and the efficiency rate has been sharply reduced compared to before. What could be unloaded in ten hours had to be extended to more than twenty hours before it could be unloaded. Furthermore, goods that should have been loaded and unloaded during the day were delayed until the evening to begin loading and unloading. The Bureau's ship schedules were often delayed, and even the schedule was often adjusted in advance to accommodate this. Due to the above-mentioned reasons, the direct and indirect losses suffered by the Bureau are incalculable. The Bureau initially gave Li leniency because he had not been in charge for long and only issued broad warnings. However, as the situation became more and more serious, the Wharf Management Office was ordered to rectify it within a limited time. Unexpectedly, while the deadline was in progress, the loading and unloading of the Taishun Wheel was delayed again. The wheel arrived at the Jinliyuan Wharf at 8:00 AM on November 10th and berthed to unload cargo. Statistics showed that there were more than 9,000 packages of salt and a total of more than 12,000 pieces of sundry goods. According to past practice, it would only take about ten hours to unload all of them. Moreover, the dock was not crowded that day, and the goods could have been unloaded that evening as usual. However, the next morning, the ship reported that there were still 1,500 pieces that had not been unloaded. The Bureau had no choice but to revoke Li's contract rights. This is a rough outline of the case. Article 7 of the South Wharf carrying labor contract states that "Party B (the contractor) must prepare sufficient and capable carrying workers to provide services at the wharf of this wharf. If the work is suspended or delayed due to insufficient carrying workers, lack of ability, strikes, riots, or labor disputes, or due to Party B's errors, Party B shall be responsible for compensating all losses incurred as a result. Regardless of whether the compensation is paid to the shipping company or to the persons concerned, Party B shall not use unloading as an excuse." Article 16 states that "If Party B has any of the following circumstances, Party A may revoke its contract rights at any time, terminate the contract immediately, and may also confiscate all or part of its guarantee deposit." Clause A of the same article states that "If there is a situation in Article 7 or Article 8 and repeated warnings are not heeded." According to Li Huanxin's taking over, the fault of violating Article 7 of the contract has long been established due to the insufficient number of carrying workers or lack of ability, which has resulted in repeated delays in the ship schedule. The delay of Taishun is only a manifestation of not obeying the warning within the warning period. Since Li Huanxin violated the contract and did not obey the warning, the Bureau had no choice but to revoke his contract rights in accordance with Clause A of Article 16 of the contract. As for the losses suffered by the Bureau in its business during Li Huanxin's contract period, the relevant personnel are now conducting a thorough investigation. Once the exact amount is determined, Li Huanxin will be ordered to compensate the full amount to protect public funds. If Li Huanxin does not agree with the Bureau's revocation of the contract, he should seek a solution through proper channels. If he refuses to hand over, the Bureau has decided to enforce it forcibly.

The Special Effects of Ailan Bally Milk Powder: Generally, nursing mothers often lack milk after childbirth due to insufficient nutrition or physical weakness, resulting in weak babies. At this time, it is appropriate to choose a reliable milk powder. Ailan Bally Milk Powder is divided into three types, which can be used to feed infants according to their needs, suitable for infant nutrition needs and digestive capacity, and is equal to healthy breast milk. Recently, a British woman gave birth after only six and a half months of pregnancy, resulting in the baby weighing only one pound. The nursing mother was also weak and stayed in the hospital for treatment. Initially, she was fed Grade A fresh milk, but the baby's development was slow and had green stools. The parents thought there was no hope of survival. After switching to Ailan Bally Milk Powder, not only did the green stools stop, but the weight had increased to seven pounds and thirteen ounces in four months. It can be seen that Ailan Bally Milk Powder is indeed the most reliable product for raising babies.

Qinghua Elementary and Middle School 10th Anniversary Special Issue
— Title by Shen Wei

### Qinghua 10th Anniversary Speech

— Wang Yiting

Qinghua Elementary and Middle School was founded in the year of Dingmao. Located on Tongfu Road, it has been ten years since. Initially, there were only twenty students. Later, the number of students gradually increased, and the school could not accommodate them. So it moved to Meibaige Road. The school building has been expanded. After many years, there was a plan to rebuild the house, so it moved to Dingxing Road. The number of students increased greatly, and the school could not accommodate them. So it moved to Baike Road, which is now the school building. The school has moved three times. The construction and management during this period have resulted in this scale. If you don't have enthusiasm, how can you achieve this? The founder is Mr. Feng Shuhua from Tongxiang. His morality is pure and his knowledge is profound. I know him well. Mr. Feng has been serving the society for more than a day. Who can't say it? Why wait for me to add it? However, regarding Mr. Feng's school management, I would like to tell everyone that Mr. Feng regards students as his own children and teaches them earnestly again and again. I don't know the credit. As for the curriculum, it adapts to the trend to expand its use. It also makes students study scriptures to plant its foundation. I have heard that the students' parents and brothers welcome it and send their children to study. The number is increasing day by day. Now, a commemorative publication is printed. Everything about the inside story and the flourishing achievements can be seen in this. After the special publication was completed, Mr. Feng urged me to write the preface. So I described it. In the mid-winter month of Bingzi. Wu Xing Wang Zhen

In the 23rd year, it moved to Dingxing Road again. Since then, the number of students has increased sharply, and the school building is not enough, so it moved to a four-story Western-style house at No. 428 Baike Road, which is now the school building. The school has moved three times so far, and the number of students has increased to more than 300. The scale has been greatly expanded. The expansion of the library, the addition of the physics and chemistry room, the martial arts hall, the ping pong room, the basketball court, the volleyball court, the badminton court, the recreation room, the children's playground, and the children's court are all available.

Qinghua Elementary and Middle School 10th Anniversary

Cai Sen Jiao Pu Pan Zhichen Title

The Honors of This School

The graduates of this school have all been admitted to famous high schools in China. Others, such as those who were admitted to the Shanghai Bank of China, the Telephone Bureau, the Postal Administration, and the Taxation Specialist Graduation School, and who have jobs, are looking forward to each other. Those who have been admitted to the Municipal Council scholarship examination, such as Zhou Jiye, Zhang Zudao, and Liang Yulao in the 22nd year, and Luo Qiusheng and Zhou Yuanyuan in the 24th year, are free for three years, and book fees are also free, which is especially excellent. This school's Boy Scouts participated in the Third National Review of Chinese Boy Scouts and the Seventh Grand Jamboree, and won the "Well-Trained" award and medal. The Ministry of Internal Affairs organized the five-province health book competition of the Department of Health, which was listed as the best grade and won a certificate and prizes.

The Planned Plans of This School

Although the school building of this school has been relocated to a better place many times. However, it is not easy to find a spacious and suitable place for each relocation. I don’t know how much effort it took to find it. It is now planned to raise funds, and when the number is reached, a base will be purchased to build a school building.

The current school system of this school is only for junior high school. It is still inconvenient for students to graduate and not be able to continue their studies in this school. It is planned to add a high school department to facilitate the opening of schools for junior high school graduates.

Although the books and equipment of this school have been purchased as much as possible. However, books and equipment are related to the imparting of students' knowledge. More equipment means more knowledge. Therefore, it is still planned to actively enrich it.

Although this school has tried its best to improve the teaching of students, the road of learning is endless. It is still planned to improve the teaching so that the students' level can be further improved.

This school is supported by Shuhua alone, and I dare not say that I am tired. I still rely on the gentlemen of the country to correct me. I hope that it will expand day by day, and the school will be fortunate. Feng Huashu respectfully stated

### Ministry of Education's Radio Program Today

Lecturer: Wu Nanbang

Time: 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM

Target Audience: Secondary Schools

### Wang Yukai's Radio Lecture on Civic Training Issues

(1)

Today I want to discuss with you the issue of civic training. Before I get to the main topic, let me share two simple stories.

(1) One day, a university professor was walking in the countryside when he encountered a shepherd. He asked him this question: "Our 'Three Eastern Provinces' have been seized by the Japanese, do you know about it?" The shepherd thought for a long time, seemingly aware of the situation, and said, "Oh, is it that the 'pig's head offerings' for sacrifices are missing? My family hasn't had a sacrifice these past few days, so I don't need pig's head offerings. What does it have to do with me if the Japanese seize the pig's head offerings from other people's families?"

(2) I remember last year when I returned from the United States, passing through Japan, I chatted with several Chinese students. We were all speaking to each other in different dialects from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Liaoning, and Jilin provinces. One student from the Northeast said, "Why is your country's language the same as our country's (referring to Manchukuo)?"

These two stories can evoke endless emotions in us. The former demonstrates the "ignorance" of the general Chinese populace, who are unaware of the concept of a nation-state. The latter exposes the mentality of young people in the Northeast today, who are gradually moving towards enslavement. The general intellectual class has largely lost its national concept and ethnic consciousness, so they are unaware that they are recognizing a thief as their father. Seeing this situation, we can understand that civic training is a matter of extreme urgency.

After the citizens of a country undergo adequate training, they can develop a national character. Everyone knows that the spirit of a country is entrusted to the people of the entire nation, and the quality of the national character can determine whether a country's future can develop. Therefore, governments around the world attach great importance to the cultivation of national character, which in other words, is an extraordinary emphasis on the issue of civic training. I will now briefly describe the characteristics of civic training in Japan and the United States, and then talk about the work that Chinese public education should do in this extraordinary period and its proper attitude. First, let's talk about the United States. There are several characteristics of American citizens that are worth emulating:

First, respect for labor—China has the saying "Labor is sacred," which is actually borrowed from the United States. The son of U.S. President Roosevelt is farming in the countryside. Some people suspect him and ask why he doesn't go to the White House to live the life of a "crown prince" or "heir apparent." He himself says that he is also a citizen and should earn his own living. The president has an annual salary of $75,000, but his wife still drives her own car. In addition to studying, college students often look for work, such as wiping windows, mopping floors, washing dishes in restaurants, and washing clothes for others. Everywhere you can see their good habits of respecting labor and advocating independent living.

Second, full of vigor—American citizens are very energetic, regardless of gender or age. Although they are older, their physique and spirit are still very strong, maintaining the vigorous spirit of their youth everywhere. When I was in the United States, two of my classmates were very old. One was a 60-year-old female classmate who earned a doctoral degree, and the other was P. of. Johnson, a 64-year-old professor at Hujiang University, who returned to the United States to continue his studies. Most of the students in our class were older. At first, I thought they were all professors, so I always stood up to pay my respects when they came to class. It was only later that I learned that they were all students. This kind of spirit of diligent learning is truly admirable.

Third, having a great and magnificent spirit—In China, building the Yellow River Railway Bridge and the Qiantang River Railway Bridge is considered a very difficult and great undertaking, but in the United States, building the San Francisco Pacific Railway Bridge and completing the Sino-American voyage are several times greater. The 22-story-high Shanghai International Hotel is considered remarkable in China, but it is very common in New York, with the highest being 102 stories. Some people think that if people on Earth want to communicate with people on Mars, they must be shot over with a cannon. As a result, many people signed up to participate. This shows the American habit of being full of the ambition to dominate the world. (To be continued)

### Securities

Swap Transactions of Unified Bonds are Relatively Active

Only 5,000 Transactions for Fuxing

Yesterday, the public bond market on the Chinese Securities Exchange was still quiet, and transactions were still sluggish. Market sentiment was increasingly stagnant as the environment became more chaotic. Major players on both sides remained firm, and retail investors were cautious about entering and exiting the market. The supply and demand of chips on the counter was still relatively balanced, but swap transactions were more active, and market prices slightly increased. However, the sluggish situation is not easy to break. At the opening price yesterday morning, due to the uncertainty caused by the Shaanxi Incident, many retail investors sold, and market prices generally decreased by 10 to 25 cents. The second round showed a strong upward trend, with No. 77 buying actively, and Class Ding and Class Jia all increasing by 10 to 25 cents. The current Class Wu was down by a small amount of 5 cents. The market situation was stagnant at the opening in the afternoon, with Nos. 27 and 32 showing more buying, and market prices rising by about 10 cents. Class Wu for the next month was slightly weaker, down 5 cents. At the close, Nos. 14 and 50, etc., were mostly selling, while No. 77 and retail investors were quite active in buying. Class Wu for this month fell by 5 cents, while the others, such as Class Ding and Class Jia, all increased by 10 to 20 cents. The closing result was a general increase of 5 to 35 cents. Class Wu for this month was down by a small amount of 5 cents. The forward price for Fuxing public bonds was still 73 yuan, with only 5,000 yuan traded. The total number of transactions was 3.47 million yuan. A comparison of the gains, losses, highs, and lows is shown in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).

### Sugar Market

Sugar Transactions are Smooth and Active

Prices Rise Across the Board, Goods are Available

The sugar market yesterday saw prices rise continuously in the producing areas, and with strong sales, market sentiment became even more enthusiastic. The guild's exchange prices were: 24 coarse granulated sugar, 22.3 yuan, transshipment cargo 7 yuan, up 10 to 20 cents from Saturday; No. 4 Dongbai, 22.3 yuan, transshipment 7.3 yuan; No. 8, 22.1 yuan, transshipment 7 yuan; YRO, 21.75 yuan, transshipment 6.8 yuan, all up 20 to 30 cents.

There were also 3,806 bags of medium granulated sugar, priced at 19.6 yuan, with 920 bags traded. A total of 2,920 bags were traded, up 30 cents from last Friday.

### Yarn Flower

Third Grade Dramatically Rises to Limit Price; Urgent Need to Cover Short Positions in Yarn Flower

Golden Rooster Rises Around Three Yuan; Standard Flower Also Jumps Six or Seven Jiao

The yarn market was flat in the morning but rose in the afternoon, with the momentum turning sharply upward. This was mainly due to the dramatic rise in Osaka's third-grade yarn. The Shanghai market was affected, and rumors spread in the afternoon that third-grade yarn had exceeded 300 yuan, leading to short-covering activities and pushing the market higher step by step. However, the current yarn business is slow, and 10-count yarn lacks sales channels. A telegram from Osaka stated that the morning session was originally scheduled to open at 1:10 PM, but the afternoon session was suspended and did not open.

Indian merchants exclusively bid on February standard yarn for future delivery. All months rose uniformly, as Osaka's third-grade yarn rebounded by eight, nine, or ten yuan, boosting market sentiment and triggering short covering, leading to another price surge. However, after the second session, it was heard that current yarn sales were slow, and the current yarn market was mediocre. It was also said that the Japanese exchange rate on the black market increased significantly, so new buyers still lacked interest. Only Jinchang exclusively bid on the February contract on the 22nd, reportedly purchasing on behalf of Indian merchants. However, factories heavily hedged by selling 10-count coarse yarn. As a result, standard yarn for all months rose by 2.7 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The market situation at the afternoon opening was slightly firm, as the closing price of third-grade yarn in the previous session had not arrived, and rumors were rampant, leading to a rise in distant months. However, some said the Japanese exchange rate might change, and current yarn transactions were not active. By the close, it was heard that Osaka's third-grade yarn had suspended trading, and scattered short positions were urgently covered, further strengthening the upward momentum. As a result, all months rose by 1.5 to 3 yuan compared to the morning's closing price. It was found that Yichang sold 3,300 bales, Dachang 800 bales, Fukang 1,100 bales, Tonghe 1,550 bales, Taichang 1,150 bales, Changfeng 650 bales, Hengchang 1,000 bales, Shengyuan 1,050 bales, and Shenchang 650 bales. Gengfeng bought 5,300 bales, Tongfu 700 bales, Jinchang 1,000 bales, Hengchang 1,200 bales, Hexing 1,400 bales, Xiesheng 1,400 bales, and Fengtai 700 bales. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.

Thread prices rose by one or two yuan, but current yarn sales remain sluggish. Statistics show that various guilds bought a total of 591 bales throughout the day, with prices remaining flat. Thread prices rose by 1.2 yuan. The buying amounts of various guilds are listed below.

The cotton market was generally flat, as cotton stocks in this port have not decreased, factory demand is mediocre, Indian cotton is weak, and market sentiment is softening. However, the rise in Osaka's Sanpin flower slightly influenced the market. In the afternoon, the yarn market improved, and market prices were raised by this factor.

### Standard Flower

Extremely Strong Buying Interest in Standard Flower. The opening of the standard flower market saw a slight increase in American cotton and a weakening of Indian cotton. However, Osaka's third-grade flower soared by two or three yuan, exciting the market. There was talk of a long position in the forward Japanese exchange rate, so market sentiment was still peaceful, and new buyers were not enthusiastic. As a result, all months rose by 0.1 to 0.15 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. At the afternoon opening, rumors were rampant as the telegram from the third-grade flower market had not arrived, and buying interest was especially strong, pushing market prices up step by step. As a result, all months rose by 0.35 to 0.55 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Yuanxingchang sold 1,400 dan, Xinchang 3,100 dan, Juxing 2,900 dan, Yuanda 1,300 dan, Shengyuan 5,100 dan, Jinchang 2,200 dan, Mingde 1,600 dan, Ruida 1,500 dan, Yichang 3,700 dan, and Dachangcheng 1,600 dan. Yuda bought 3,200 dan, Yuanyi 1,000 dan, Jifeng 2,000 dan, Xingchang 3,200 dan, Shenji 4,400 dan, Changfeng 3,100 dan, Runkang 5,200 dan, and Fengtai 7,200 dan, Fukang 1,560 dan. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.

Current Cotton Consumption is Very Sluggish. Cotton mills have weak appetite. 1,180 bales of Dao flower and 1,918 bales of Tong flower arrived.

Third Grade Only Has Opening Transactions

Yarn Rises Around Ten Yuan

Flower Good at Three Yuan and Five Jiao

Eleventh Osaka Telegram, Third Grade only had opening transactions, Future yarn rose by 8.4 to 10.1 yuan, Near month was 290 yuan, Far month was 273 yuan, Future cotton rose by 2.5 to 3.5 yuan, Near month was 75.7 yuan, Far month was 80.2 yuan,

Indian Cotton Shipments to Japan Increased Sharply Last Week

### Piece Goods

Cotton Cloth Drops in Price Across the Board

Transactions Are Clear as Settlement Period Nears

Quality of New Brands is Mixed

Yesterday, the cloth market was stagnant, and current sales were sluggish. As the Lunar New Year approaches, cloth merchants are reducing credit transactions, hoping to end them early. The actual demand from the Guangzhou, Wuzhou, and Kunming guilds in the south remains extremely dull, with only a little over a hundred packages of light and heavyweight coarse cloth purchased. Shantou and Xiamen slightly purchased fifty or sixty pieces of colored cloth, coarse cloth, broadcloth, fine twill, and five-six cloth. The Sichuan guild slightly purchased over two hundred pieces of yuan gray, navy blue fine twill, blue cloth, and fine cloth. The Shandong guild purchased over a hundred cases of local-factory serge, broadcloth, and blue cloth. The Jiangzhe and inland guilds were the most quiet, and the business of storefronts was also very sparse. White goods, fine cloth, fine twill, raw cloth, and East goods remained firm, with a slight decrease of 0.25 fen. Local-factory fine cloth and fine twill continued to decrease by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan per piece. Local-factory and English-factory coarse cloth and heavyweight goods, such as 13, 14, and 16-pound grades, fell by about 0.1 to 0.2 yuan per piece. Lightweight coarse cloth remained at the original price. Blue cloth and colored twill remained sluggish, occasionally falling in price by 0.1 or 0.2 yuan per piece. New brands sold at cheaper prices, with a difference of 0.5 to 1 yuan for the same cloth quality. White flannel has lost its popularity, with prices falling repeatedly, causing great confusion in the market. However, bleached cloth has seen a slight increase in price of around 0.1 yuan due to factory shortages.

### Oil Market

Soybean Oil Plunges by Eighty or Ninety Jiao

Ultimately Unable to Escape Dalian's Influence

Recently, the soybean oil market has been dull due to slow sales. Although Dalian prices have mostly risen with few falls, market sentiment has been weak, and the market has been stagnant for a week. Yesterday, news came that Dalian prices had fallen, and trading began, with prices falling by 0.8 or 0.9 yuan compared to the price seven days ago (the fourth), including 200 pieces of local factory oil, 450 pieces of ship Niuzhuang oil, 100 pieces of ship Dalian oil, 50 pieces of ship Shahe Qishan oil, 100 pieces of sandboat Yantai Qishan oil, and future trends, if no clear sales channels, may be fixed again,

### Grain

Future Wheat Market Suddenly Plunges in Afternoon Session

Spot Goods Mills are Not Greedy

Flour Sales are Also Clear

Yesterday, the future wheat market opened in the morning, with prices initially stabilizing and then falling. As foreign wheat quotations from the US and Canada both rebounded by 0.5 yuan, market sentiment was stable after the opening, rising by 0.01 yuan compared to the previous week's closing price. However, as the settlement period neared, trading across all channels slowed down, and customers with actual goods were considering selling their positions, leading to a very flat market sentiment. By the afternoon opening, market sentiment suddenly softened as the current wheat mill demand was not checked, and quotations were low, causing the current month to fall first, dropping by 0.05 or 0.06 yuan compared to the morning. Distant months saw more outside speculators closing their positions, leading to a rapid fall and active trading. This situation was due to sluggish flour sales, leading to a natural downward trend. The spot wheat market saw very clear transactions, and prices also loosened by 0.05 yuan. 6.51 to 6.5 jiao yuan per bag of Tiantai wheat, 6.48 yuan per bag of Shaoxing wheat, followed by 6.4 yuan, totaling over 2,000 bags, which were reportedly purchased by Fufeng.

Future Flour Shows Slight Rebound

Yesterday, the flour market showed signs of recovery at the morning opening. As foreign wheat quotations from Chicago and Canada both rose by 0.5 yuan, near and distant months rose by 0.03 or 0.04 yuan compared to the previous week's closing price. However, as the settlement period was approaching, customers were mostly watching and waiting. Only the Beijing guild continued to purchase, but some speculators took advantage of the high prices to close their positions, leading to a flat trend after the second session. As the afternoon opening approached, initial actual sales were weak, and wheat quotations were also flat. All months fell slightly by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan, but then both buyers and sellers were scarce, and outside speculators slightly purchased, stabilizing the market somewhat. Judging by the current situation, if sales to the north stop, the results for this month may trend downwards.

Guangdong is Actively Purchasing Rough Sen Rice

Yesterday, the incoming and outgoing sales of guest Sen rice were active, and market sentiment was excellent. Since the Guangdong guild began purchasing from Shanghai, its appetite has gradually increased. Yesterday, rough rice was actively purchased in the market, and market sentiment was increasingly optimistic. Moreover, the Shantou guild followed suit, and the Guangdong guild still had a strong appetite. However, there was not much rough rice in floating storage, and merchants and brokers insisted on holding on to their stock. Yesterday, market prices rose sharply by 0.15 to 0.2 yuan, and mechanically milled white rice was also slightly boosted. Furthermore, the Guangdong and Shantou guilds did not purchase enough yesterday. If incoming goods are not plentiful today and tomorrow, market prices may need to become more competitive again. A total of 8,730 bags of Jiangxi rice, 500 bags of Hunan rice, 2,000 bags of Hankou rough rice, 500 bags of Anhui rough rice, and 2,000 bags of Wensen rice were sold, all of which were distributed by the Guangdong and Shantou merchants. Other guilds were watching and waiting.

White Geng Market Situation Turns Firm in the Afternoon

(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of each guild totaled more than 70 locations, a total of 14,340 stones of goods. Among them, there were more than 40 locations for Bo rice. The sales market in this street was slightly better than before, and the appetite also felt slightly moving. It is estimated that the Tianjin and Qingdao guilds purchased more than 2,000 bags of Bo rice, which stabilized the market situation. The price of Bo rice had nothing to celebrate, but the sales channel for Hou Geng remained sluggish, leading to a continued price drop of one jiao. The future market situation seems more stable, Duyangjian is slightly soft, and Yinyuan is lacking competition,

(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various roads under the river were slightly scarce, about ten stores, but the existing stocks were still heavy, and the market's sales were still sluggish, and the customers wanted to stop selling because the prices in the producing areas were still expensive. The merchants cleverly stocked up the white geng at the later market, with a slight loss of sales, plus some scattered users also slightly advanced. The price of the early market was small by one or two jiao, and the afternoon market turned firm. The early rice was one jiao small, the Bo rice was one or two jiao small, the Yang Dubu Jian price was tired a small number of points, the Baiyuan price was soft five or six points, the Yinyuan goods were few, and the price was firm, and at the closing of the later market, the prices of various goods were stable.

### Hardware

American US Steel Rises by Two and a Half Yuan

Black Iron Sheet Transacted Four to Five Hundred Bundles Daily

Recently, the arrival of 200-pound American US steel has been very scarce, and the local stock is weak. The current market price is 39.5 yuan per case, an increase of 2.5 yuan compared to before. There are transactions with Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and various guilds along the Yangtze River.

Black iron sheets are also in short supply due to high trading volume. Enamel factories, thermos factories, and silver box workshops are all purchasing, so prices continue to rise. 2.6-foot, 18-sheet floral pattern sells for 12 yuan, second grade sells for 11 yuan, 3.6-foot sells for 14 yuan, and rough floral pattern sells for 12.5 yuan. It is estimated that daily shipments reach 400 to 500 bundles.

### Silk and Tea

Ji Li Silk Rises Another Ten Yuan Compared to Last Week

Yesterday, the Yokohama silk market fell slightly, with both current and futures prices falling by seven to ten yuan, causing the local foreign firm silk market to become even more silent. For example, the American firm's white factory's R-grade, seven to eight evenness, 20.22-strip limit price was only 800 yuan, a difference of more than 30 yuan from the Shanghai silk merchants' asking price, resulting in very few transactions. In the Indian firm's silk market, Ji Li opened at a new high price again yesterday. For example, the Qianjinma grade sold for 635 yuan yesterday, an increase of 10 yuan compared to last week, which is truly commendable. The user silk market is not deserted, but due to the high silk prices, transactions are not active. 2 pieces were sold yesterday.

Moroccan Green Tea Continues to Fall

Spanish War Becomes Increasingly Serious

Stocks Are Sold at a Loss

According to news from Morocco, the market for various green teas has been plummeting in the past week. Authoritative Jewish tea merchants, in view of the increasingly significant international nature of the Spanish war and the sluggish commercial signs in the ports of the French Morocco region, are selling their stocks at a loss and ordering their agents here to stop shipping scheduled green teas. The current selling price of top and middle-grade Zhenmei green tea is over 80 French francs lower per dan than at the end of last year. Other varieties such as Zhenmei and Zhuma are also down 30 to 90 French francs. The situation is extremely worrying.

### Special

The Production, Sales, and Manufacture of Qihong (Day 1 Continued)

(5) This Year's Tea Prices

In previous years, Qihong new tea was launched on the market around mid-May. This year, due to the authorities of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces implementing unified control over the transportation and sale of Qining black tea, Shanghai tea houses opposed it en masse. As a result, although the new tea had arrived in Shanghai, foreign firms had not purchased it due to unresolved disputes. It was not until May 29 that price negotiations began, and official transaction records started on the 30th. This year, the highest price for the first batch of Qihong tea reached 275 yuan per market dan, with the remaining prices below 270 yuan, and the lowest price was only 42 yuan. The highest price for the second batch of tea was 240 yuan, and the lowest price was only 28.5 yuan. The highest price for the third batch of tea reached 175 yuan, and the lowest price was 23 yuan. The highest price for the fourth batch of tea was 90 yuan, and the lowest was 18 yuan. The highest price for flower tea was 42 yuan, and the lowest was 12 yuan. The huge difference in prices is truly astonishing.

In terms of tea prices, regardless of the batch, the improved black tea from the Qimen Tea Industry Improvement Center fetched the highest price. The tea produced by other tea merchants with tea-making experience also fetched good prices. In terms of region, the price of Qimen tea was higher than that of Fuliang. For example, the highest price for the first batch of Qihong tea was 275 yuan in Qimen, 220 yuan in Fuliang, and only 117 yuan in Zhide, which is a significant difference. The price difference for the other second and third batches of tea was smaller than that for the first batch, but the trend was the same. In other words, the price of Zhide and Guichi black tea was the lowest, followed by Fuliang, and the price of Qimen tea was the highest. This is consistent with the quality of the tea. This is because Zhide and Fuliang harvest later, so the appearance, color, aroma, taste, and leaf base of the tea are inferior to those of Qimen.

However, not all tea produced in Qimen is superior to that of Fuliang, and some are inferior to Fuliang tea. Therefore, the above is only a general statement. The quality of tea making and the level of market prices depend entirely on the tea house's tea-making experience. Therefore, preventing the occurrence of inferior tea does not lie in promoting the production of a certain tea area, but in emphasizing the tea house's capital and experience and preventing indiscriminate establishment. As for Fuliang and Zhide counties, it is particularly important to promote tender production. That is, the public and buyers should not stubbornly adhere to preconceived notions about Fuliang tea, but should bid based on quality. Then the tea industry in Fuliang can be developed, and the quality of Qihong tea can be improved through competition.

Generally speaking, the quality of high-mountain tea is better than that of low-mountain tea. The difference in the quality of black tea in various parts of the Qiqu area is said to be due to the influence of the natural environment. The temperature, humidity, and rainfall in the Qiqu area are only recorded by the Pingli Tea Industry Improvement Center in the southern countryside of Qimen over the years. As for Fuliang and Zhide counties, there is no such record, so we dare not speculate on it. As for the altitude of each area (land height), we have slightly measured the areas surveyed this year. The altitude of the area with the most tea production in the southwest of Qimen is usually between 160 meters and 300 meters. Gaoling in the northern countryside reaches 750 meters, but there is not much tea produced. As for the area in the northern countryside of Fuliang that borders Qixian, the altitude is also above 200 meters. The altitude of the upper, middle, and lower villages in Zhide is lower, about 150 meters. It is not possible to determine whether the reason for the inferior quality of Zhide tea is entirely due to this without further research. However, high-mountain tea often benefits from the moisture of clouds and fog, so it seems to have a higher aroma than low-mountain tea. Is this the reason why Zhide tea is inferior? This requires further research.

In short, although good raw materials can be produced at high altitudes, they cannot necessarily be used to produce excellent black tea, as mentioned above. Good raw tea materials often deteriorate due to prolonged delays or careless refining by tea houses. Therefore, even if the altitude is high, the quality of the finished tea is not uniformly good.

The high price of Qihong this year is the first year after 1931. The reasons for the improvement in the price of Qihong tea are nothing more than two:

1. The exchange rate has shrunk by about 30% since the implementation of the legal tender policy, so the market price of Chinese tea has the potential to increase by 30%.

2. Due to the effectiveness of unified transportation and sales.

The above two points are the reasons for the improvement in the price of Qihong, and the latter is particularly helpful in raising the price of tea. Can it be said that the exchange rate has shrunk this year, so the price of tea should generally increase. However, according to the facts, this is not the case. The market price of black tea, except for Qining tea, has not seen an increase. The prices of various green teas are also almost the same as last year. Therefore, the unique high price of Qining black tea is not entirely due to the reduction in the exchange rate, but to the unified transportation and sales. Without the unified transportation and sales of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces, foreign merchants could still implement a divide-and-conquer policy for tea houses, achieving their goal of suppressing prices. Tea houses are agencies that sell tea on behalf of inland tea houses, and gains and losses are irrelevant. However, inland tea merchants suffer. Although the tea houses' opposition to control is inappropriate, it is understandable in terms of fighting for survival; however, a small number of tea houses blindly follow suit, destroying the government's control, and it is truly unknown what their intentions are.

Although the price of Qihong tea is high this year, not many people get the average price, and the remaining prices are mostly in the 70 to 80 yuan range, and as low as 40 to 50 yuan. However, the mountain price of raw tea in the Qiqu area this year is lower than in previous years due to price suppression by various tea houses. The cost of the first batch of finished tea is about 100 to 120 yuan, the second batch of tea is about 60 to 70 yuan, the third batch of tea is 40 to 50 yuan, and the fourth batch of tea is only 30 to 40 yuan. The average cost of refined tea is about 60 yuan per market dan. This only applies to Qimen. As for Fuliang black tea, the cost is even lower, because the mountain price of raw tea is not as high as in Qimen.

The cost of Qihong is low and the selling price is high, so tea houses in the Qiqu area, except for a few that have losses due to inferior tea making, generally have profits to be made. This is a rare good news in recent years.

(6) The Future of Black Tea

The premise of promoting domestic products is "low price and good quality." Tea is no longer an agricultural product monopolized by our country. India, Ceylon, and the Dutch East Indies produce and sell more black tea than our country; therefore, the survival of our country's tea in the future depends on reasonably priced and good-quality products to survive in the world market. Qihong tea has not yet reached the expected quality, and its price is higher than that of Indian and Ceylon black tea. It is difficult to attract the attention of European and American people to increase sales. In the face of the global wave of economic recession, there are not many people who buy tea at high prices. However, everyone seeks to improve their lives, and they hope to obtain satisfactory quality at the lowest price when drinking tea. Therefore, if Qihong tea wants to expand sales, reducing prices is as important as improving quality. Among the domestic black teas in the British market, only Qihong tea can be sold separately. If the black tea in the two lakes can only be sold mixed with Indian and Ceylon tea, the sales of Qihong tea are more independent and promising. If improvements are made in terms of quality, cost, selling price, and promotion, it will not be difficult to restore the past glory of Qihong tea. (End)

Spring and Autumn

### Sketches of Great Shanghai

— (Fang Zheng)

A Pilgrimage to Stone Road

Stone Road is the only clothing agency for the poor, because it is not easy to make clothes in Shanghai. The materials are expensive, the workmanship is high, and it is troublesome! But Stone Road solves everything for the poor. As long as you choose clothes that are similar to your size, you can wear them at any time. It is simple and economical. Therefore, most of the clothes of the so-called "old door sill" in Shanghai are picked up on Stone Road.

Yesterday, I followed a friend on a tour of Stone Road. As usual, many tempting winter clothes were hung there, great horse-riding coats, fur robes, camel down robes, cotton trousers, woollen shirts, scarves... In short, everything was available. At the same time, they, the clothing store, shouted out particularly cheap sacrificial items in front of the so-called "beach platform", which attracted many workers in short clothes and vagrant children in gowns and long shirts, squeezing and looking, hoping to obtain "cheap and good" items to keep out the cold. But some people are "pickpockets" for life, because when people are completely focused on cheap goods, they use their magical skills to secretly steal your wallet, so all "old thresholds" are quite wary of this.

Because I wanted to find a camel down robe, I searched more than ten shops before I found a target in a large double-wide shop.

This clothes face is too new, I am afraid it is not an original pawn, right? I asked the shop assistant in the tone of "old door sill".

"Sir: Ge piece of clothing is completely genuine original pawned goods. Look, isn't this the trace of the pawnshop?" He pointed to the folded marks on his chest to show me.

According to "old door sill", you should buy the original pawned goods when buying clothes, because it is worn by people. It is full of pawnshops. The materials and workmanship are more exquisite. I chose the clothes. What is the price? According to the shop assistant, it is fourteen taels, (this is the rule of the clothing store, each tael is calculated at ten corners, and the actual price is nine yuan and eight corners). Because I found it relatively cheap, the transaction was successful.

I wore the robe back in the evening. On the road, I proudly glanced at my fellow travelers wearing long shirts. But my heart felt as heavy as green lead.

### The Oriental St. Petersburg, etc.

— Zhou Xian

Ten years ago, in Shanghai, which has the reputation of the Oriental Paris, there was an area called "The Oriental St. Petersburg," located in the western part of the French Concession, near Avenue Joffre, now known as the Street of Mystery. At that time, the White Russians who fled from Russia and settled in Shanghai almost all lived there. As a result, Russian-style hotels, bookstores, grocery stores, etc., sprung up on Avenue Joffre, which was originally very lonely. The French-style Avenue Joffre was filled with Russian flavor. Therefore, everyone called Avenue Joffre "The Oriental St. Petersburg."

Ten years is a small change. The Oriental St. Petersburg cannot escape this formula, from prosperity to decline. Because in these ten years, the Russians in the Oriental St. Petersburg have only survived by one or two tenths compared to ten years ago. And after the sound of cannons on January 28th stopped, most of the mysterious caves on North Sichuan Road had been moved to Avenue Joffre, so the original tempting alias of North Sichuan Road, "Street of Mystery", was also moved to Avenue Joffre. So now whoever mentions Avenue Joffre will naturally say "Street of Mystery," and everyone has forgotten "The Oriental St. Petersburg" indifferently.

Although the Oriental St. Petersburg has been gradually forgotten in these ten years, in the Hongkou District, a so-called "Little Tokyo" has appeared in these ten years. This so-called "Little Tokyo" is the short section of Wusong Road from Sanjiao Vegetable Market in the east to Shenjiawan in the west. There were originally many shops of a certain country on this street. Since the cannon fire on January 28th destroyed North Sichuan Road, the signs of shops of a certain country on Wusong Road have become denser. It is said that the current so-called "Little Tokyo", shops of a certain country, account for more than eight tenths. If you slip past in that area without paying much attention, you will be sure to be stimulated in your eyes by the completely certain country-ized color, and forget that you are still in Shanghai.

After January 28th, during a small prosperous period, it is said that Shanghai's Little Tokyo had a very prosperous time. But since the unfortunate incidents have been discovered one after another in the past one or two years, the prosperity of Little Tokyo has been declining. In the past, the lively scenes after dinner have been swallowed up by steel helmets and bayonets protecting the safety of overseas Chinese. Although there are still Chinese people walking in Little Tokyo now, certain country people are still smiling and warmly welcoming Chinese customers, but compared to two years ago, it is also a bit unbearable to look back at those days.

The Oriental St. Petersburg has become a relic of the past, and Little Tokyo is also showing signs of decline. People in Shanghai who love exotic customs do not know where they will create a prosperous center with exotic customs in the future?

### Wenmiao Road

— Shi Hua

On Saturday or Sunday afternoons, you see thousands upon thousands of people flocking to the gates of the zoo or the Temple of Confucius. Although the inside is already packed with people, and the entrance is crowded with people scrambling to buy tickets (zoo tickets cost six coppers), the crowds surging from Zhonghua Road, Penglai Road, and Wenmiao Road (northern section) are still so numerous that it can be nearly impossible to pass.

This crowd includes small businessmen who only have Sundays off, "country folk" who have come to Shanghai for a visit... In short, it encompasses farmers, workers, merchants, students, soldiers, the elderly, children, men, women, the tall, the short, the thin, and the fat—everything and everyone is there. Sometimes, even some foreigners come in cars to visit!

I dare to say boldly: "Wenmiao Road on Saturdays and Sundays is a gathering place for the people of Shanghai."

Even on weekdays, although not as crowded as on Saturdays and Sundays, the liveliness is no less. After four o'clock, students just released from school naturally head towards Wenmiao Road. At this time, Wenmiao Road becomes a place for male and female students to chase after each other. Female students carry leather satchels, chatting in groups of three or five about school news. Male students, with thick Western-style books under their arms and neatly pressed uniforms, also in groups of three or five, talk about things like, "Miss Chen didn't reply to my letter!" or "Zhu Xufang was with Lao Lin at Jin Cheng yesterday!" ... and so on.

"Smith Wang, did you receive my letter!" a male student asks, chasing after a female student who has just walked past him.

"..." The other party does not reply, only lowers her head even further.

"...Why didn't you reply!" the male student asks again, stepping closer.

The female student rolls her eyes at the male student, then quickens her pace and runs away. The male student then retreats, feeling dejected.

Around five o'clock, the crowd gradually thins out, and the bell inside the Temple of Confucius rings, signaling closing time. The sky slowly, slowly darkens, finally entering the night stage. Wenmiao Road at night becomes eerily quiet, with hardly any pedestrians to be found. Only the fallen leaves of the plane trees by the roadside drift thickly in the street, replacing the daytime pedestrians.

### The Wardrobe Escape (Middle)

— Te

The Heroic Deeds of a French Mother and Daughter

Upon arriving home, she prepared some food for Mr. Fuller. Poor Mr. Fuller, having spent over four months sleeping in the deep forest, now sat comfortably indoors and enjoyed a hearty meal. Mrs. Bascon, because her own home was small and had no place to hide Mr. Fuller, then sent the British soldier to his mother-in-law, Mrs. Gopeer. Her house was larger and easier to find a place to hide. However, her family's life was not well-off. Normally, her daughter Angelia earned a living working in a weaving factory. Now that the weaving factory had been destroyed by the German army, Angelia relied only on a sewing machine at home to support her mother and younger sister. Adding the food needed for this guest would inevitably make things even more difficult. Angelia, however, did not worry about this, willing to work hard to overcome this difficulty. What was concerning was that harboring an enemy soldier, if discovered by the German soldiers, would mean that everyone, even if not sentenced to death, would taste the flavor of iron bars. What to do? Angelia suddenly had an idea, exclaiming: "We have it! The wardrobe, the wardrobe!" This wardrobe was placed in the corner of a ground-floor room, about five and a half feet tall, divided into two compartments, one for storing miscellaneous items and the other for hanging clothes. So, they took out the clothes and asked Mr. Fuller to enter. This wardrobe was later purchased by Sir Charles and donated to the Imperial War Museum, where it is still on display.

In later years, Mr. Fuller said to people: "At that time, to meet the immediate need, I could only reluctantly comply with the owner's kindness and lie down in the wardrobe. At first, I thought I would only be hiding for a day or two, but later I realized that there was no way to escape. If discovered, my own life was not important, but it would implicate the owner. So, I had no choice but to endure the pain and lie inside for a long time."

Since Mr. Fuller hid in the wardrobe, everyone was anxious, praying day and night that the secret would not be discovered and that Mr. Fuller would have a day to see the light again. However, unexpected dangers occurred at any time. One day, Mrs. Gopeer received an order that eight German soldiers would be staying in her home for a few days. Military orders could not be disobeyed, so Mrs. Gopeer and her daughter hurriedly made arrangements to avoid revealing any flaws. Therefore, when the German soldiers came, although they often sat in the room a few feet away from the wardrobe, they did not notice that an enemy soldier was hiding in the wardrobe. According to Mr. Fuller, what he feared most at the time was coughing. Once, he suddenly felt like sneezing, and he tried hard to hold it back, thus avoiding being exposed. That was truly dangerous.

Time passed quickly, and Mr. Fuller had been hiding in the wardrobe for about eighteen months. Suddenly, an order was issued to requisition the entire house of Mrs. Gopeer, ordering Mrs. Gopeer to move out within a time limit. So, Mrs. Gopeer rented a house nearby and prepared to move. But how to arrange for this British soldier? Moving had to be done during the day, but Mr. Fuller dared not go out except at night. Later, everyone agreed that Mr. Fuller should still hide in the wardrobe and be moved along with it. Mrs. Bascon then invited a trusted lumberjack friend to help, and the two used all their strength to move the wardrobe out of the room. At this moment, a strong German soldier hurried downstairs, and seeing the two sweating profusely, he rushed forward and exclaimed: "Let me help you - oh, how heavy this is!" Mrs. Gopeer remained calm and replied calmly: "Yes, I have piled all the heavy things inside." She also said: "Sir, please don't open the wardrobe door, because there are many glass objects inside."

### Snow Treading in the Bund Park

— Ying Dai

In the wind and snow, I mustered my courage, widened my steps, and stuck out my belly as I walked towards the Huangpu Riverbank, not feeling cold at all. Snowflakes were falling thick and fast on the Huangpu Bund Road. There were fewer vehicles and horses on the road than usual, and there were not as many pedestrians as usual either. Although trams and buses still came and went according to the scheduled times, the number of passengers had clearly decreased significantly, and there was not nearly as much crowding as usual. The grass by the river was covered with a layer of white snow. Along the river, apart from a few coolies walking occasionally, there were no other pedestrians to be seen. Each time the municipal ferry docked, only a few passengers boarded or disembarked.

I walked to the iron railing and looked far out into the river. The ships coming and going in the Huangpu River, just like the road above, were much fewer than usual. The northwest wind struck the heart of the Huangpu River in gusts, stirring up giant waves capable of swallowing ships. Snow fell on the shore, where it would accumulate, but when it fell into the Huangpu River, it disappeared without a trace, having long been conquered and melted by the water. The foreign ships and giant vessels anchored in the river, covered with a layer of white snow, could also be vaguely seen. Looking at Pudong, all the factories and houses were indistinct because of the falling snowflakes in the sky. All I could see were some blurred black shadows.

The row of iron-framed chairs by the river were usually always full of people, but when it snowed, no one sat there idly admiring the scenery of the Huangpu River, leaving empty chairs covered with white snow. The snowflakes in the sky fell thick and fast, melting immediately when they landed on the sidewalk, but accumulating on the grass, dyeing the dry yellow grass on the ground white. Looking out over the entire park, all the pavilions, water fountains, rockeries, and monuments were covered with snow, changing their original colors. Several low-lying evergreen trees, such as holly and cypress, were covered with white snow, creating a green and white contrast that was even more lovely to look at.

The wind was blowing harder and harder, and the snow was falling heavier and heavier. The lone tourists wandering in the park felt a bit of coldness on their bodies and could not stay long. Shall I go? So, I took a circle in the park and then came out. At this time, it was already dusk. The tall buildings on the Huangpu Riverbank appeared as blurred images in the lightly flying white snow, and even the customs clock could not be seen clearly. Even the light of the electric lamps seemed much weaker than usual. Returning home in the heavy snow, my wife asked me if I felt cold going to the riverbank to see the snow in such cold weather. I answered bluntly: "If I feel cold in this kind of snow, how are those fighting the enemy in the frozen wilderness?"

### Swapping Nests, Matching Phoenixes

— Written by Zhang Henshui

Chapter 10 (Su Paqi Intertwines Strange Texts, Errors in Casting, Yellow Flowers Grieve, Autumn Letters Add Sorrow)

In these words of his, he truly gave Guoshi a great deal of comfort. He thought to himself that having someone like Menglan as a lifelong companion, or even as a friend, someone to correspond with in writing, someone who was a reader of his works, was a truly comforting thing in this life. He was a literary drudge, and all he had gained was his mother's loving kindness. Although he had a few friends, their backgrounds, temperaments, and studies were all different, and it was difficult to be completely in tune with them, to form a bond of sworn brotherhood. Now that he had Menglan, this deficiency was made up for. Thinking of this, he felt refreshed, so he sat down at his desk, arranged his paper and brush, and wrote a piece of prose that was neither prose nor poetry without adding a single dot. The text was:

My spirit is excited by her, my thoughts are sharpened by her, my life is sweetened by her, and my environment is made prosperous by her. I also do not understand why she is so great to me. But when I am illuminated by her clear eyes, it is like the cross adding blessing to my soul, the water of the willow branch adding moisture to my lungs. I respect her as I would a Buddha, but do not see her solemnity. I love her as I would a flower, but do not see her嬌艷. I admire her as I would the moon, but do not see her remoteness. I approach her as I would snow, but do not see her coldness. In short, all of me is now dominated by her, but I feel that before I knew this person, I was one kind of person. After knowing this person, I am another kind of person. Why am I like this, I do not know myself, I can only ask the creator. Yet I have not even exchanged a single word with her.

His thoughts surged, and he wrote in one breath without knowing how, until he wrote that "also" character, completing the sentence, and then put down his pen. He read it again to himself, and it seemed to please him. He smiled slightly. Because it was written in a moment of high spirits, he could not bear to throw it away, nor did he think about it much. He folded the paper and put it in his drawer. That afternoon, because of other things, he put this matter aside. By the next day, he had forgotten about it. As for Menglan's letter, because he had learned that it was very dangerous to send letters through the post office after receiving her report, he put the letter he had written in his drawer and did not send it out. He thought to himself that since Youmei had left this note, she would come every day, so he would wait. (121)

### Sketches on the Suzhou Creek

— Ya Fei

It's getting cold. In the morning, I climbed out of the warm bed, rubbed my sleepy eyes, and put on the icy clothes. My lips and teeth chattered against each other, and my body seemed to tremble like a vibrating string. After a hasty wash, I carried a book, braved the cold morning wind, and strode along the banks of the Suzhou Creek. But the morning mist was very thick, permeating the entire metropolis. All the scenery was hidden under this veil of mist, and it was not easy to make out things even a mere ten feet away.

The rumbling of wheels broke the silence of the space, but the white, misty fog was pressing lower and lower, so low that it was almost impossible to see oneself clearly. One by one, trams and trucks were already swimming in the middle of the road with their heavy bodies. Beside the Waibaidu Bridge, a milky-yellow skyscraper appeared faintly in the sky. It seemed like a beautiful girl, draped in a light gauze, standing there endearingly. Shadowy figures moved dimly along the bridge railings. Several riverboats roared with sharp, strange noises, causing cracks in the solidified sky, but the small steamers passed under the Waibaidu Bridge in this thick fog, advancing towards the misty river surface.

The Suzhou Creek and the Rihui Port are two equally important inland ports. Especially the Suzhou Creek, it is like a belt spanning the middle of the International Settlement, dividing the International Settlement into two sections, north and south. Moreover, since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the Suzhou Creek has become a chasm of safety and danger.

Many firms and inland river shipping bureaus are located on the south bank. Every morning or evening, the vegetable market at the old Zhabei Bridge and the mountain goods stores at the Touba will be lively as usual. The small steamers and fast boats in the river are busy all day long, going out, coming in, empty, full, adorning the river surface quite lively. It is like the blood vessel of this city. As long as it stops beating, the city, which contains endless happiness and sin, sadness and joy, will die with it.

As usual, every evening, near the section between the waterworks bridge and the Zhapu Road, there are always many empty boats parked here. They are always arranged so densely that there is not even a gap between them. At dinner time, a wisp of white smoke comes out of the stern of each boat. Seeing the countless wisps of white smoke combine on the river surface, they finally disappear into the flowing waves. After dinner, some of them put up cloth awnings and stretched their arms straight, lying on the flat surface; others gathered around a dim mast lamp and played cards on the stern of the boat. Their leisurely lives seemed to realize that the current situation was still a peaceful world, and they seemed not to have thought about the severity of the national crisis or the pain of life. But when I opened my eyes and looked at the waves on the Huangpu River, and listened to the cries from North China, I couldn't help but feel a little confused.

Shen Bao Medical Special

### From the Reform of Health Administrative Institutions to the So-Called Chinese and Western Medicine Problem (Part 1)

— Hua Xinren

Academics has no boundaries, so there is fundamentally no need to divide medicine into "Chinese" and "Western" medicine. Similarly, in terms of career and academic research, as long as it is for the welfare of mankind and the public as a prerequisite, we should cooperate with mutual trust and understanding. Therefore, we should not have the names and boundaries of Chinese and Western medicine, and even more so, we must not retain this feudal and strong color in the current stage.

The difference in the names of Chinese and Western medicine precisely reflects the inferior nature of our nation, because we should seek reasonable progress, and cannot tolerate conservative degeneration. Therefore, the names of Chinese and Western medicine fundamentally cannot exist in theory, and should be clearly divided into "scientific and non-scientific," which I believe is correct.

Our understanding of all things should be analyzed with reason, and not rejected with emotion. Especially for the public health work of the whole people, we should use a strong and rational discrimination. Subjectivity cannot determine the survival or destruction of Chinese and Western medicine, and even more so, we cannot use "people" as the object and unit in therapeutics to determine the fate of Chinese and Western medicine. Therefore, the survival or destruction of Chinese and Western medicine should be based on the theory. This is right.

Chinese medicine has its own historical value, but what is lamentable is that Chinese medicine, from Shennong tasting hundreds of herbs to the practical Compendium of Materia Medica today, has never had any improvements. This is what is meant by Chinese medicine losing its scientific and forward-looking research, and falling off the axis of the times. The way of learning is that if you do not advance, you retreat. In other words, "conservative stubbornness" is corrupt and backward. Only "catching up" is progressive and scientific. In the current situation, are we choosing to "catch up" or "persistently conservative"?

Currently, some people advocate reforming the health administrative institutions and list reasons. However, based on facts and needs, our country's health administrative institutions are not yet ready for reform. Health work is a career to protect the lives of the whole people, and its responsibility is directly responsible to the lives of the people, and indirectly related to the rise and fall of the nation. Therefore, health undertakings are a kind of academic research and scientific work, and not a power struggle organization. In the past, the people of our country lacked trust in hygiene, and the government officials were unwilling to promote it, so it formed the current national weakness, the people's physical poverty, and the high mortality rate. According to statistical reports, the average annual death rate in our country is 12 million people, and the economic loss due to excess deaths is 300,000 million national currency. The percentage of deaths from infectious diseases is 43.3% - Japan is 29.0%. This is enough to prove that health work is urgently needed in the current internal environment. The serious problem that occurs in the current stage is not the reform of the organizational structure of the health administrative institutions, but how to enrich and develop the domestic health undertakings. It is also not the right to divide the rights of the minister of Western medicine and the minister of Chinese medicine, but to think about how to implement public medical construction? How to carry out scientific research on Chinese medicine? I think that in the development of the career and the welfare of the people, we should trust and cooperate with each other to devote ourselves to the construction of public medicine. According to a reason, people generally feel that the current Chinese health administrative institutions are biased towards Western medicine and squeeze Chinese medicine out of the line, which has caused resentment and advocated practical reform. This is somewhat of a subjective problem. If the atom of the current advocacy of reform is focused on the power struggle, then it is on the road to extreme contradictions, because this slogan occurs in the interest of spirit and matter, and sacrifices and ignores the welfare of the people. Therefore, although advocating reform, failure is undoubtedly. For more than ten years, there has been a gap between Chinese and Western medicine, and the doctrine of "governing each other" has been promoted, and many portals have been established separately. In many debates, emotions have become increasingly estranged. Therefore, I think that the consciousness of those who advocate the reform of health administrative institutions should be based on the fundamental reasons. Otherwise, repeatedly chanting verbally will only lead to disputes of spirit, drum up their tongues and use clever deception to deceive each other and hurt each other. The so-called application of the traditional policy of "distant contacts and close attacks" will inevitably lead to unexpected failures. Therefore, if we want to truly and purely advocate the reform of health administrative institutions to enrich the public health work of the whole people, I think the prerequisite is the adjustment of the Chinese and Western medical circles, and the eradication of the subjective actions of mutual jealousy, slander, and criticism. If you don't start from this point and only discuss the atomic rights division, the result will not only miss the opportunity, but also cause both sides to suffer, and make the nation and the sick unbearable. The main goal of advocating health administration and institutional reform is the problem of the director and deputy director. Since the health administration of our country has been changed from the Ministry to the Department, and the scope has been reduced several times, it has also been used as an official vacancy for the public health work of the whole people. The so-called preventive work and health work have no results. In recent years, health has been changed from the Ministry to the Department, and from the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the Executive Yuan. Its work is obvious to all. The person in charge has been running the business, so various tasks have been progressing quickly. In the Health Laboratory, special attention is paid to various experimental research work. The most effective is the establishment of a public health personnel training institute to cultivate lower-level cadres. In the difficult national funding, the health administration authorities have struggled hard to achieve the current results. It is not easy to prove that the current health administration authorities are burying their heads in hard work and research, and are doing their best to strengthen the national defense health facilities and strengthen the public health work of the whole people. But here, we want to ask, is the situation of the reform of the health administrative institutions, which is competing for the expansion of power, and making the fate of the Chinese and Western medical circles and the health undertakings fall into a must-die state, out of a need, or is it out of sincerity? There is no doubt that health undertakings cannot be gambled on, nor can any part of the country have the ambition to act recklessly, and no part of the country can be allowed to have great threats to attempt large-scale encroachment. The reason for this is not to say that the current status of Western medicine in the country has maintained the centrifugal force of the country, and made Chinese medicine have to cut off the dream of revenge. I think that if Chinese and Western medicine are really permanently in a position of confrontation, the loss will certainly be unjustified, and the public health of the whole people will also feel a great impact. Therefore, promoting the harmony between Chinese and Western medicine is the top priority at present, and the reform of administrative institutions is the next!

### On Cancer (II)

— Xiaozhu

Considering the origin of the character "cancer," if we disregard the mechanical aspect, it can be inferred that its intended meaning is derived from a combination of both pictographic and semantic elements. It describes the afflicted object as resembling cancer in shape and nature. Observing the external appearance of a cancerous tumor, the meaning derived from this character aligns almost undoubtedly with what modern medicine refers to as cancer. Furthermore, examining the Western terms for cancer, "Garcinoma" in Latin, "Krebs" in German, and "Cancer" in English, the meaning is also found between pictographic representation and semantic derivation. It suggests that the localized spread of this entity resembles the extension of crab legs, adept at moving sideways. (Originally a general term for various chronic ulcers - from the old medical dictionary) Old medical dictionaries explain the character "癌" (cancer) as describing an object consisting of a tumor mass with many protrusions that are not smooth, and its nature is hard as stone. Etymologically, there is no record. In short, the origin of this character, in both Chinese and Western traditions, is rooted in both pictographic and semantic elements, although one emphasizes form and the other emphasizes action. Fortunately, this matter is not of great significance; the main question remains: What is called cancer? The new medical view on this is:

Cancer is a new cell tissue that originates from the transition of original, identical cells, but its nature is completely different, and it possesses an independent life force. This type of cell tissue does not proliferate when the various tissues in the human body maintain a balanced force in their development. Once it arises, the equilibrium of the body is destroyed, and the new growth develops independently and unrestrained. The resulting impact is the qualitative, quantitative, and functional deficiency of the cell tissue from which any type of cancer originates, along with other associated implications. This is what causes the patient's illness. Simply put, cancer is a new growth. The essence of this new growth is any type of epithelial cell line tissue in the human body. Under certain circumstances, it loses its normal way of life and goes astray. It not only ruins itself, but also corrupts other neighbors close to it. Furthermore, it can use the convenience of transportation routes to move to more distant areas, reproduce, and make the places it reaches its victims, turning them into its own kind. For the sake of their life progress, it is an obstacle to the health of the body, so various functions gradually disappear, forming an incurable pathological state. Let's use national political situation as a comparison! The nature of cancer is equivalent to the bandits in our country who were heavily suppressed several years ago and are still being sporadically suppressed now. They were also good citizens, but one day they became abnormal and lost their original nature and function, becoming a harmful and useless group of elements, diminishing the country's vitality and forming the country's disease. The only difference here is that the emergence of bandits has a cause that can be found, and if corrected, they can still return to their original nature and become useful members of the country again. On the cancer side, the cause of its emergence is still an unproven theory, and once it starts, trying to restore it is an extremely rare occurrence (only the possibility of self-destruction). Perhaps there will be a possible day in the future!

Since the definition (hypothetical) of cancer is as described above, what we need to know next, of course, is the morphology and organization of cancer itself. Cancer that is located on the surface of the skin often appears as nodules, which ulcerate after a long time; some appear as nipple-like tumors. Cancer in internal organs is often found as infiltration and nodular giant nuclei. Pathological histology tells us that the main component of cancerous tumors is, of course, cancer cells. They gather in one place, interspersed with connective tissue to provide nutrients. The morphology and properties of cancer cells are not unique. The difference between them and the cells in their original location is that they are smaller and less regular. The most important point is still the morphology of the cell nucleus, the reduction of nucleolus, and the darkening of staining. Abnormal methods of nuclear decomposition. The overall structure of a cancerous tumor often strongly imitates the organizational appearance of its place of origin. In terms of physiology, it also relies on aerobic nutrition. In addition, there is another type of fermentation ability discovered by Warburg. It can decompose glucose into lactic acid. This effect is called glucose decomposition, or Glucolysis. The growth ability of cancer cells is very strong, developing simultaneously in three dimensions. However, the speed of onset is inversely proportional to the health of the human body. That is to say, if a strong person develops a cancerous tumor, the malignant onset of this cancerous tumor will definitely be slow; conversely, it will proceed rapidly. Cancer cells can sometimes degenerate on their own and be eliminated. Therefore, cancer patients sometimes have the possibility of spontaneous recovery after onset. There are many types of cancer, which need not be described in detail. They can be simply divided into two major categories: adenocarcinoma and epithelial carcinoma. After briefly outlining the anatomical physiology and living conditions of cancerous tumors, we naturally need to know its causes, or the so-called pathogenesis. That is to say, for what reason do epithelial cell line tissues or organs in the body become cancerous tumors? This is an extremely difficult question to answer. If someone could, and his answer could be generally accepted, then this person would immediately become a world-renowned scholar and a wealthy man. Because for this public case, countless public and private institutions and individuals have offered heavy rewards to solve this problem. Our national government also offered a reward for Sun Yat-sen's liver cancer, announcing to the people to apprehend the murderer. But he flew away into the dark, not knowing where he was hiding, and there were no clues. Regarding this question, the existing theories, which I will now parrot, are roughly three: one is

## Page 16

the bacterial theory, one is the parasitic organism theory, and one is the stimulation theory. The obvious fact is that the formation of cancerous tumors is not a one-sided motive; it must have two conditions to trigger it. One is the static cause, which is what we call the constitution, or Disposition, and the other is the dynamic cause, which is the various things I am now talking about.

In the heyday of bacteriology, all diseases were blamed on bacteria. Cancer was naturally no exception. Many people tried to find a bacterium to be considered the pathogen of cancer. But the results were all disappointing. In fact, no special bacterium can be found that, like other infectious diseases, has all the necessary conditions of a pathogen, such as culture, inoculation, artificial pathogenicity, and so on. In this work, countless efforts were wasted, but no unique object of cancer was found. What was mostly obtained were the appendages within the cancerous tumor ulcer, the products of so-called secondary infection, or Sekundart Infektion. In this situation, some people have argued that these bacteria belong to the category of filterable ones. The British doctor Gye:Banard published an article in the Lancet magazine saying that cancer is an infectious disease caused by a certain filterable bacterium, or, to be more cautious, a virus. He had used ultraviolet light to take pictures, but it was not generally recognized, because there are many types of cancer, and what he used to conduct experiments and as a strong basis for this theory was

### Overview of the Dingxian Rural Women's Training Class

— Yuheng

In order to promote hygiene to rural families and to make farmers' family life hygienic, the Hygiene Department of the Chinese National Association of the Mass Education Movement has specially opened a rural women's training class. The training courses focus on hygiene, and also include subjects such as drawing and art, animal husbandry, and home industry, so that in the future, they can return to various villages to assist in the initial women's work of rural construction.

The method of recruiting students for the class is to use a selection method, stipulating two to four students per village. Villages with health workers and demonstration villages have priority. The age limit is 20 to 25 years old, but married women have a priority to be selected. Because the Pingjiao Hui's work in Dingxian has gained the approval of the people, many people have signed up. Due to the limited number of places, only 40 students have been selected, and they have all entered the class for training on the 3rd. All expenses are provided by Pingjiao Hui.

The students in the class all come from rural areas, and their levels vary. Some have graduated from civilian schools, some have graduated from senior civilian schools, and some have even studied in the second grade of junior high school. There were some difficulties in the initial management aspect, but now they have been completely trained well. The students are all working hard to explore, feel that hygiene is very important, and have developed a strong interest in it. The arrangement of various courses is quite in line with the principles of hygiene, and the content of the courses meets the needs of the students. The courses taught every day are common sense, history, law, hygiene, gardening, animal husbandry, home industry, and entertainment. Every evening, the tutor-student method is also used to teach literacy and report on current events. The class has many courses, but life is completely based on hygiene principles. Various hygiene habits have also been developed in this shortest period of time. It is now divided into four groups, which are adjusted every day.

Nursing Group—Correcting shortcomings, nursing

Cleaning Group—Sprinkling ladders and cleaning the environment

Handicraft Group—Cotton thread production

Cooking Group—Meals

Each group has teachers who live with the students, are full of energy, have good order, and work in an orderly manner. The six weeks of training will surely benefit the rural areas in the future. I have recorded it in detail to tell the people of the country, hoping that our hygiene community will rise up and do it.

### Chemical Relationship of Nerve Action

— Shengtao

The Committee of Professors of the Caroline Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, has determined that the winners of this year's (1936) Robert Prize for Physiology and Medicine should be Sir Henry Hallett-Dale of London, England, and Otto Logi of Graz, Austria. The achievement of the two men's joint research is the chemical relationship of nerve action.

The beating of our heart sometimes fast and sometimes slow, is controlled by two nerves. One, the sympathetic nerve, which we all know, can be called a "heart whip" and creates a "whee" sound, which is the driving force that makes the heart beat rapidly. But when the heart beats, it also emits an opposite "halt" sound, which is controlled by the vagus nerve. It is from these two nerves that the process of rapid leaping and melancholy, cheers and depression, in the beating of the heart is created. The sympathetic and vagus nerves are indeed the masters of this process.

What kind of divine power do these two nerves have to make the heart emit "whee" and "halt" sounds? Electricity, a kind of radiating force in the mysterious life process, or chemical relationship? In the past, physiologists and physicians all regarded it as an unsolvable mystery!

Professor Nowi's invention states that the action of the above two nerves is due to the fact that these nerves can secrete a chemical substance directly to the heart. Professor Nowi's conclusion is based on his detailed research in the laboratory. Professor Nowi's experiment was to dissect a frog and expose its heart, and stimulate the vagus nerve of the frog. Then the frog's heart beat gradually slowed down. Then, Professor Nowi transferred the fluid discharged by the frog's heart after the vagus nerve was stimulated to another frog's heart, and the heart of the latter frog immediately slowed down. Professor Nowi's merit in winning the Robert Prize lies only in this. However, this seemingly unimportant scientific observation has extremely important significance. After the vagus nerve of the frog is stimulated, the fluid discharged from its heart must contain a certain substance, and its action is equal to the vagus nerve itself. Thus, the mystery of nerve action has been revealed. The certain substance contained in the fluid is the neurohormone. Thus, neurochemistry, brain chemistry, thought chemistry, and sensation chemistry are established.

The success of this experiment was actually years ago. When a reporter from the Vienna News interviewed Professor Nowi, the professor claimed:

I have served at the University of Graz for twenty-six years. The completion of this research and its experiments was actually years ago. Frankly speaking, I did not imagine that this work would be favored by the Committee of Professors of the Caroline Institute in the Swedish capital and be awarded a prize. In any case, in addition to rejoicing, I will definitely continue to work harder and continue my research. The professor is now sixty-two years old!

After the success of this experiment, researchers studying neurohormones have spread to scientific research institutions all over the world. Recently, it has even been possible to accurately calculate the chemical composition of nerve stimulating substances: about 0.000006 cm per thousandth.

There is no end to scientific research. Today, Professor Nowi's achievements are only the beginning of research into neuroendocrinology. A thorough understanding of this subject still requires the continued efforts of future scientists!

### Common Sense of Hygiene for Diseases of the Eyes, Ears, Nose, and Throat

— Tang Renjin

(115) Eustachian Tube

The Eustachian tube, also known as the auditory tube, or ear canal, is a trumpet-shaped tubular structure. One end opens into the anterior wall of the tympanic cavity of the middle ear, called the tympanic orifice. One end opens into the pharynx, called the pharyngeal orifice. The total length of the Eustachian tube is about 3.5 centimeters. The proximal third (about 1 cm long) is made of bone, while the rest (about 2.5 cm long) is made of cartilage and membranous tissue. The boundary between the cartilaginous and membranous part and the bony part is the narrowest point, called the Eustachian tube isthmus. The outer wall of the Eustachian tube is attached to the tensor veli palatini muscle. When this muscle contracts, the lumen of the Eustachian tube can be opened, allowing external air to enter the tympanic cavity. Also, the levator veli palatini muscle is attached to the base and inner wall of the cartilage. When this muscle contracts, it can also assist in opening the Eustachian tube. The cartilaginous part of the Eustachian tube gradually widens from the isthmus, forming a trumpet shape, which is why the Eustachian tube has the unique name "ear trumpet." Once the Eustachian tube becomes narrow or blocked, symptoms such as hearing difficulty and tinnitus can be felt.

(116) Eustachian Tube Stenosis and Blockage

Eustachian tube stenosis and blockage often occur in (1) rhinitis (often suffering from nasal obstruction, resulting in insufficient ventilation of the nasopharynx and reduced air pressure, followed by hyperemia of the nasopharyngeal and Eustachian tube mucosa), (2) paranasal sinus empyema (due to the stimulation of purulent fluid flowing into the nasopharynx, the nasopharyngeal mucosa often falls into an inflammatory state, and the Eustachian tube cavity is thus narrowed), (3) pharyngitis, (4) adenoid hyperplasia, (5) palatine tonsillitis, and (6) palatine tonsil hypertrophy.

The main symptoms of this condition are that the patient feels hearing difficulty, tinnitus, fullness in the ear, and dizziness, etc. In addition, this condition has a unique point: the patient's hearing is often temporarily improved after swallowing, yawning, and sneezing. If an otoscope is used for examination, it is a characteristic of this condition. Sometimes, the horizontal line of liquid accumulated in the tympanic cavity can be observed, which can move with the patient's head position (maintaining the relationship of the horizontal plane).

The treatment method for this condition should focus on treating the cause. For example, patients with rhinitis, paranasal sinus empyema, pharyngitis, or palatine tonsillitis should be treated as soon as possible. As for those with adenoid hyperplasia or palatine tonsil hypertrophy, it is especially advisable to perform resection as early as possible. At the same time, using Eustachian tube ventilation often has significant effects.

### The Relationship Between Tooth Decay and Life

— Ren Junming

After our baby teeth are replaced by adult teeth, we should have a total of 32 teeth. Because there are so many and they are used seamlessly, the chances of collapse and erosion gradually increase. The oral cavity is the only channel for food intake. Bacteria enter through food and reside in the gaps between teeth and the gums, often as many as twenty or more species. Other food residues and meat scraps remain in the remote parts of the teeth. If they are not wiped clean, they will mix with bacteria and carry out their decay work. In the beginning, it undergoes fermentation to form a liquid called lactic acid. The enamel, the outermost layer of the teeth, collapses after prolonged immersion in lactic acid. Bacteria proceed with decay from the already collapsed small holes, gradually expanding. In a few months, it even penetrates the enamel and reaches the dentin. Because the hardness of the dentin is less than that of the enamel, the degree of decay is also faster. Unclean objects block the hole, accumulating more and more over time, and the temperature inside the hole is also higher than outside the hole. The proliferation of bacteria thus becomes more frequent, the decay becomes more intense, and the collapsed cavity expands even more. In the dentin, some dental tubules that are susceptible to bacterial and lactic acid attacks gradually dissolve and split, and the delicate nerve fibers in the dental tubules are stimulated, causing soreness and pain, and then necrosis. However, this is only a part of the symptoms of decay and pain. When the soreness begins, the pulp in the tooth is still alive. If proper treatment is applied at this time, removing the decayed material, killing the bacteria, soothing the living pulp, and then restoring it with a suitable filling material, it will be no different from a healthy tooth.

If you do not follow the above method and fill it in time, the bacteria will advance deeper, penetrating the dentin and directly into the pulp cavity. The pulp cavity is located in the center of the tooth, where the pulp is stored. At this time, the pulp is exposed and has no protection. Any cold or hot air, and all soft and hard substances, will cause excruciating pain when touched. Even if it is not touched, the pulp has been revealed and infected by bacteria, it will inevitably become inflamed and painful. At this time, if you go to the dentist, use medicine to kill the pulp, reduce inflammation, remove dirt, detoxify, draw out the pulp completely, fill the root canal, and repair the crown, not only will you be spared from pain and disease in the future, but its chewing function will also be no different from a healthy tooth.

If, by the time of the above period, you are still unaware of treatment, allowing the decay to progress, the pulp cannot withstand the infection of bacteria and poisons, and it becomes highly inflamed, congested to death. Its remains remain in the pulp cavity, mixed with other decaying substances, and then become putrid and purulent, advancing along the root canal to become pulp gangrene. At the same time, the periodontal membrane is also infected, causing congestion and pain, and the diseased tooth floats. It often affects the gums to become inflamed, spreading to the cheeks. Muscles and nerves are stimulated and compressed at the same time, causing pain and swelling. Sometimes, fortunately, the body's resistance to leukemia is strong, and it can control the progress of the disease and gradually recover. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon. Although the symptoms seem to be relieved, the progress of the disease has not stopped. At this time, the root-end periodontal disease may become chronic suppurative inflammation, such as root-end abscess, periodontal suppuration, and alveolar pyorrhea. Dr. Mayo, an American dentist, said that this type of chronic dental disease can cause more than 150 kinds of serious diseases throughout the body and pose a direct danger to life. The most common ones are caused by chronic dental infections, such as appendicitis, gastric ulcer, endocarditis, kidney disease, lung disease, neurological disorders, ophthalmia, and arthritis.

Those who are unfortunate enough to turn into acute giant patients, such as osteomyelitis, osteomyelitis, and alveolar abscesses, can even lead to septicemia and death.

People often regard tooth decay and pain as a minor disease, neglecting to seek medical treatment, thinking that it is not important to health and life. In fact, it is a big mistake. When acute and chronic diseases become deeper day by day and the immune function gradually weakens, life is in danger. It is pitiful and regrettable.

The above is only based on popular propaganda. Other detailed descriptions will be discussed in the next issue.

### Expanding the Puppet Organization in Eastern Hebei

— Fang

According to news from Tianjin yesterday, a certain party is plotting to expand the puppet organization in Eastern Hebei and establish a communist prevention government. At present, a certain special agency in Tianjin is actively promoting it, with traitors Cheng Guorui, Yang Rongzhai, Zhao Wenjun, etc. as leaders. Their plan is to sabotage transportation, claiming that it was done by the communist bandits. Although this plan is extremely vicious, they have been using vicious means for a long time, so it seems commonplace and not surprising. However, the Hebei authorities should deal with it carefully.

A certain party originally demanded autonomy for five provinces. Because our side refused, the goal was not achieved, so the price was greatly reduced, and it was changed to the demand for autonomy for Hebei and Chahar. However, the asking price was too extravagant, and our side could not agree. We had no choice but to come up with various destructive policies and cruel behaviors in order to achieve its fixed goals. Now that this conspiracy has been discovered by our side, we should take measures to strictly prevent it, use force to stop it, and it is difficult to tolerate it any longer.

For example, in Chahar, why was it unknowingly completely occupied by foreign forces, so that Suiyuan has been frequently alarming? During the Bailingmiao incident last year, I don't know how many heads were spent and how many hand-to-hand combats were fought before we could take it back, and the extremely important commercial capital in eastern Sui is still in the hands of bandits and puppets. It is really easy to lose and difficult to get. Don't say that the disease of the limbs has not yet reached the heart.

Now, in eastern Hebei, a certain party is actively expanding the puppet organization. Where is Hebei Province? What is the name of the puppet organization? If we continue to tolerate it and let it act freely, then the disease of the heart will have been formed. No matter whether they still want to expand or promote, even if they do not expand or promote, the current organization that is neither donkey nor horse is shocking and frightening. If such a place is not prepared in advance and corrected severely, the future will be unimaginable.

The other day, after our side seized a certain party's special agency in Zhengzhou, we found many secret documents, ㊀ planning the independence of counties north of the Yellow River in Henan Province, ㊁ colluding with bandits and local militia to riot, ㊂ compiling reactionary slogans to incite the public, ㊃ carrying out espionage work, and ㊄ organizing special radio classes. This kind of cruel and secret behavior has been discovered everywhere. If this kind of conspiracy is not severely punished, it will inevitably cause trouble everywhere, and there will be the same organization everywhere. As the saying goes, "Treading on dew means hard ice will arrive," and "A trickle not stopped will become a river." This kind of cruel behavior cannot be dealt with without cruel means.

### Five Blessings Arrive

— Daxiao

The incredible story of "five daughters born at once" in Ontario, Canada, once caused a sensation around the world. These five little rascals had already learned to walk in January of the year before last, and last year, they were able to dance and play games. This is truly commendable!

These five happy children are often cared for by a special doctor to make their lives completely hygienic; and pay attention to the calcium and vitamin D content in their food. Because calcium and vitamin D are important raw materials for teeth and bones, and are especially needed by developing children. So some children have poor bone quality and tooth decay because of calcium deficiency!

"Jiale Calcium" chocolate candy is a new product of our country's Wuzhou Pharmacy. The taste is no different from ordinary chocolate candy, but it is rich in calcium and vitamin D. Children often eat it to make their bones develop well and create a lifelong health foundation.

### Wife

— Wang Muxin

Recently, my wife's spirits have been very happy, and her complexion has become ruddy.

I remember in the past, my wife often had a melancholy look, her body was weak, her nerves were on edge, and she would often argue with me over trivial matters. Although she would regret it afterward and cry, she would soon be arguing with me again!

Seeing my wife in this state, I suspected that she must be ill. After careful questioning, I found out that she was suffering from "dysmenorrhea." Then I understood that her depression and irritability were due to this condition.

Now, she has been taking "Monthly Red" for two months, and her illness has completely disappeared. Her body is getting healthier day by day. In addition to being happy, I am also grateful to the Wuzhou Pharmacy for this.

### After Watching Huang Bochang's Wrestling

— Yin Fei

I went to see professional wrestler Mr. Huang Bochang's first match in Shanghai. The performance was very exciting, making people feel a sense of cruelty and involuntarily clenching their fists with sweaty palms. The atmosphere that day was not very lively, and Chinese spectators accounted for only about 10%. I suppose this is because Chinese performances in this area often fail.

Later, the situation was different. I heard from friends who had seen the show that many Chinese people were watching. I also saw in the newspapers a news story about a lady presenting a robe before the match. I guess that was because Mr. Huang Bochang had won. Feeling "proud and honored," she went to "raise her eyebrows and exhale." Later, because he was "always victorious," naturally more people went to "raise their eyebrows and exhale." Of course, there were also regular patrons who went out of concern. Some went to watch the spectacle because they heard it was exciting and intense, but there was also an element of patriotism at play. If Huang Bochang had failed the first time, even if it were more exciting and intense, I don't think so many compatriots would have gone to watch.

Recently, several newspapers have said that the match was fake and have used this as a basis to discuss the issue of "professional" versus "amateur." Whether it is fake or not, I, as an outsider, cannot tell, and that is not what this short article wants to talk about. As for the issue of "professional" versus "amateur," I have paid too little attention to sports and have no research, so I naturally cannot talk about it. What I want to talk about are some other trivial thoughts.

I remember that after the news of the Chinese athletes' complete defeat at the World Games came back, there was an "uproar of public opinion." The so-called "public opinion" here does not only refer to newspapers and magazines, but also includes the conversations of friends during tea breaks. The reasons for the "uproar" can be roughly divided into two types. The first is that it was said that not only was a huge amount of money spent, but China's reputation was also lost. The latter says exactly the opposite, saying that losing face is secondary, because this was expected. What is most regrettable is the waste of so much money. If this funding were used to build a good cause in the country, it would be more practical and beneficial. Although there are two types of "uproar," there is only one reason: because they returned completely defeated. If they had scored a little, I don't think the "public sentiment" would have been so intense.

This time, Mr. Huang Bochang's performance in Shanghai is exactly the opposite of the World Games. He is a "victorious general." Because he is a "victorious general," the number of Chinese spectators who felt "proud and honored" gradually increased.

Some people say that the audience's love of wrestling is due to "barbaric heredity." One newspaper translated an article by American professional wrestler Jackson, in which he said, "These many civilized audiences also have a barbaric heredity. The more brutal the match, the more bloody and terrifying it is, the more the audience is attracted. Those women who are called lovers of tenderness are even more fascinated than men."

This statement may have its reasons, but it is not a very good reason. For example, when I watch this cruel game, I do feel that the more brutal, the better, but there is a limit to this. That is, the brutality must belong to those with whom you sympathize. So, when Huang was being held by the opponent, this "brutality" aroused my cruel feelings. The same feeling exists when watching ball games. When the team we sympathize with loses, we always feel uncomfortable. The origin of this sympathy can almost be said to be innate. Even if forced, it cannot be changed. The more forceful, the deeper the aversion. And strangely, sympathizers seem to be in groups. In the ballpark, no one "orders" or "subsidizes," but those who sympathize with a certain team often naturally make up the majority, and the remaining opponents are mostly because they have some vested interest with the other party.

Huang Bochang makes us sympathize because he is Chinese; and the Chinese audience watching his performance has increased because he is "always victorious" and they feel that he is "winning honor for the country." This lesson is very worthy of our attention, and there are many examples, such as the resistance against the enemy in Suiyuan.

Please cherish this "sympathy," and please make good use of this "sympathy." Lastly, I want to warn everyone.

### Overseas People

— Jin Ge

Old Guang aimlessly wandered the streets, hoping to run into a newcomer (Note 1) or a fellow villager (Note 2), to bum some money for a temporary meal.

Old Guang was just released from prison yesterday. While in jail, he didn't have to worry about meals. Once released, he suddenly didn't even have food to eat. Fortunately, he met a newcomer yesterday and conned him out of dinner. Today is harder.

"Let's go to the employment agency and try our luck." He suddenly thought of this place. His heart seemed to have some hope. The entrance to the employment agency was crowded with people. Dark and dense, it felt suffocating. The sign at the door was tilted upward, and the white lettering was covered with a thick layer of grease.

"Damn it, it's too crowded!" Old Guang cursed in his native dialect.

He tried hard to squeeze in, but was pushed back out.

"Damn it, I don't want to squeeze anymore. Even if I get in, I still won't have food to eat!"

He turned around and was about to walk away when he unexpectedly saw Lao Hua, a fellow villager he hadn't seen in years. He hurried over and grabbed his wrist, acting very friendly. In reality, they were all broke, so who would put on airs!

"Lao Hua, long time no see, are you rich?"

"You're rich!" Lao Hua was insulted by Lao Guang's asking if he was rich.

"If I were rich, would I be here? What have you been doing lately? How's it going?"

"If things were going well, I wouldn't be here!" The two laughed miserably.

"What! You still want to squeeze in?"...

Lao Hua broke free from Lao Guang's hand and tried hard to squeeze in, but Lao Guang pulled him back.

"I'm trying my luck!"

"Don't be delusional! Look! So many people, can you even squeeze in? Even if you squeeze in, those foreign devils (Note 3) there, will they register you? If they register you, will you have food to eat?"

"Ha! The foreign devils don't even have food to eat, let alone the Chinese (Note 4)!" He sighed.

"Let's go, let's go for 'six weeks' instead!"

Old Guang pulled Lao Hua, not allowing him to refuse, and dragged him away.

"Okay! Anyway, I don't have food to eat!"

Lao Hua made up his mind and followed Old Guang.

The winter wind kept blowing against them, making their bodies shiver uncontrollably. Their stomachs were rumbling. They walked to the train station and, when the police weren't around, sneaked onto the platform and managed to get into the train car. The two were now somewhat at ease.

The slow train started. The yellow fields were rapidly receding behind them. The winter wind in the wilderness blew even harder, but it couldn't reach them.

One station, two stations, they had already sneaked through three stations.

"Lao Guang: It's not good, the ticket collector is coming!" Lao Hua looked very panicked.

"What are you afraid of? We'll just get off!" Old Guang was quite calm.

So, at the fourth station, they were kicked off the train.

"Lao Hua! We've never been here before!"

"Good! Let's stay here!"

The two, like ghosts, ventured into the bustling street. The shops were all decorated with New Year's red lanterns, red and green, dazzling!

"Hey! There's a policeman ahead... time to act."

The police whistle sounded. A small commotion broke out on the street. Two policemen grabbed them by the collars and took them to the new guest office.

"Lao Guang, time to eat 'six weeks' worth of free food!"

Note 1: "Newcomer" is a Cantonese term for a newly arrived person, with a derogatory meaning.

Note 2: "Fellow villager" is what Cantonese people call people from the same village.

Note 3: "Foreign devil" is what overseas Chinese call Americans, sometimes they also call them "Foreign people."

Note 4: "Chinese" is what Chinese in America often call themselves.

### A Visit to the Shanghai Poor People's Shelter (Part 1)

— Li Caihua

To learn about the situation of the poor people's shelter and the lives of the poor inside, I made a visit to the Chao Hui Wu Yi Villa at the South Railway Station the day before yesterday.

Upon entering, I saw many reed mat sheds with signs saying "No Smoking." I explained my intentions to a person standing at the gate wearing a white cloth symbol, and they led us to the general affairs office. The administrator of the general affairs office, Mr. Jiang, immediately introduced the head foreman, Mr. Chen, to show us around. After the tour, I asked the following questions:

"How many years has your shelter been in operation?"

"This is the eighth year."

"Are there any procedures for the poor to enter and leave the shelter?"

"The procedure is very simple. Upon entering the shelter, first, we check for flammable materials (such as lighters); second, we register their name, age, and origin; third, we distribute clothes and blankets; fourth, we shave their heads; and fifth, we assign them to a class for formal shelter life. As for leaving the shelter, we have four methods: those who are young and strong but unemployed are sent to the vagrant vocational training center; the elderly are sent to the nursing home; those with family members are allowed to be taken away by their families; and those who have no money to return home are sent back with travel expenses."

"Where do the poor people in your shelter come from? How many people are there now?"

"The sources of the poor can be divided into three categories: one is that they come on their own, two is that they are sent by the Social Bureau, and three is that they are sent by the Public Security Bureau, with the most coming on their own. There are currently 1,400 poor people, about 1,000 adults and about 400 children. The oldest is an old man in his seventies, and the youngest is a six-year-old child. Most are between twenty and forty years old."

"Are there any restrictions on who your shelter takes in?"

"We do not refuse anyone."

"But what happens when the number of people exceeds the capacity? Doesn't the cost also exceed the budget?"

"When the number of people is too crowded, we can arrange for them to go to the second shelter. If the second shelter is also crowded, we can set up a third, fourth... Fortunately, there is no rent. As for the funding, we were originally struggling to find it. Most of the funding comes from the help of philanthropists and government subsidies. Now, of course, we are still constantly raising donations from the outside world. We spend an average of two dimes per poor person per day (including food, water, medicine, etc.). If we calculate with 1,400 people, then it costs about 280 yuan per day, and each term costs 30,000 to 40,000 yuan."

"When does your shelter start accepting people each year? When does it end?"

"We start about ten days before the winter solstice and end about ten days after the Qingming Festival in the following year."

Opening: "Flower Names"

In the golden stove, let's burn sandalwood. A sprig of jasmine to pray to the gods. I am, a peony maiden, beautiful in the boudoir. Impeded by hardship, I lack vigor. I don't even feel like drinking camellia. Helpless, I swallow opium to numb the pain. In the spring silk curtain, I long to sleep. The tuberose scented dream carries drowsiness. I lazily apply hibiscus powder to my face. I have no desire to choose hairpins of gold finches. I feel cold even when draped in mallow. I constantly tie my willow waist with a pomegranate skirt. In the evening, my stomach full of plantain, I can't sleep soundly. The cuckoo sings on the branch at the third watch. I have become, a tender begonia, weak and tired. I must pray to the Guanyin Bodhisattva seated on the lotus flower. May she protect me, so that I may be relieved of illness and gain longevity. May I pass through the winter solstice and enter the new year. May I inform my loving mother of my filial piety. The flowers are gold and silver, my wishes are fulfilled. The Buddha smiles and my sincerity reaches the gods. I will not be, like a frivolous peach blossom, drifting with the current. I want to cultivate the Tao and enjoy eternal spring. The ten sisters have completed their marriage rituals, but I, a jasmine, do not wish to be tainted by the mundane world. One must know that the peony boasts of wealth and honor, but several butterfly dreams are not real. What is said about the crape myrtle lover, gentle and refined, what is said about the lotus, ordinary and beautiful. No matter if you are a magnolia or a golden phoenix guest, you are all people of the reed catkin gathering. Pearl vines also represent empty fame.

Opening: "Liu Yi"

Peach blossoms are like embroidery, willow trees are like gold. Zhang Xu invited Liu Yi to travel. Both are talented and handsome. They are classmates and from the same village. They went to the countryside together to find poetic inspiration. Strolling leisurely near the seashore. He saw a shepherdess with a look of sorrow. Shyly hiding from people. Her clothes were not like those of an ordinary woman. A kind of charm and beauty that is exquisite. He asked the beautiful lady about her family. Why not try to tell me her life? Her beauty is not like that of a shepherdess. She modestly lowered her eyes and spoke softly. Her soft words were like an oriole coming out of a valley. I am seeking a messenger for my father's anger today. The rhino horn on my head can be used as proof. The big tree by the river can be the door. As he pointed and said, there was indeed a shade under the big tree by the river. He gently knocked several times. Little did he know that this horn was a rhino horn. In an instant, it could separate the sea water. A crystal palace and a lapis lazuli throne. He paid respect to the man sitting on the throne with his crown. The emperor was frightened and angered. Since this is the case, how can I tolerate it? Discussing marriage does not hinder the separation between the dark and the secluded. The crocodile drums sound in harmony and joy. Entering the Dragon Palace before Dongting Lake.

Chirp, chirp, chirp, the birds are chirping,

Chirp, chirp, chirp, they have returned to their nests.

Caw, caw, caw, the crows are making noise,

Caw, caw, caw, they say it's late.

The hardworking Brother Ox should also rest.

The wild flowers by the path are smiling slightly,

The merciless branches and leaves are swaying,

Making my head ache, making me feel annoyed.

Alas, who knows our suffering?

We till other people's fields and plant other people's rice,

We keep others warm and feed them full,

Year after year, it's always the same.

Baa, baa, baa, the sheep are eating grass,

Baa, baa, baa, they say they are full.

Cluck, cluck, cluck, the hen is calling,

Oh, oh, oh, I forgot!

La la la, la la la,

Cluck cluck cluck cluck cluck cluck cluck cluck cluck,

Cluck cluck cluck, cluck cluck brings, cluck cluck brings,

A small and exquisite egg is laid.

"Xiao Sanzi got a big silver coin!" Xiao Sanzi got rich! "Xiao Sanzi made a fortune!"

The slum was in chaos because of this sound. Many people came out of the shantytowns, chickens flew, dogs barked, children cried, and women wailed.

The fire started, everyone shouted, everyone ran, Xiao Sanzi's parents all ran, fell in panic, and the silver dollar fell on the ground.

Fire! Fire! Fire! The houses collapsed, fierce fire, smoke, shouts, and burning sounds.
